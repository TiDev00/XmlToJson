<HEAD>Says Congressional Leaders Given Gulf Crisis Phones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURG, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole said Monday that he and
other key congressional leaders have been given special mobile
telephones so the White House can keep them informed of
developments in the Persian Gulf.
   Dole, the Kansas Republican and Senate minority leader, said he
and at least four other lawmakers have had the phones for about a
week.
   The others, he said, are Democratic Sen. George Mitchell of
Maine, the Senate majority leader; House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Washington; and House leaders Reps. Robert Michel, R-Illinois,
and Richard Gephardt, D-Missouri.
   Dole said the phones have been specially adapted to prevent
anyone from listening in.
   Dole mentioned the phones while making a campaign appearance for
fellow Republican Dick Nichols, who is running for Congress in
Tuesday's election. He said he carries the phone with him at all
times, and said it allows him immediate consultation with Bush or
other White House officials.
   The phones show Bush ``is making a sincere effort to consult
Congress on the Middle East crisis,'' he said.
   ``The only time he would not consult Congress is if a mission or
American lives are threatened,'' Dole said. ``In that case,
consulting with the congressional leadership can wait.''
   Dole said he hopes he doesn't get a phone call because ``that
would mean an escalation of the crisis in the Middle East.''

<HEAD>NASA Aiming for Atlantis Launch Next Week</HEAD>

   NASA expects to send space shuttle
Atlantis into orbit with a spy satellite next week.
   Forrest McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center, said Monday
``the best guess'' is Atlantis will lift off on its secret military
mission around Nov. 16.
   Liftoff had been scheduled for Nov. 9 but was delayed because of
undisclosed problems with the satellite, which reportedly will spy
on Iraq.
   The shuttle actually was supposed to have gone up on a 10-day
mission in July but was grounded all summer by hydrogen leaks.
   NASA still plans to launch Columbia in early December, even
though the agency likes to have at least three weeks between
flights, McCartney said.
   Work will be speeded up so Columbia's flight can be completed by
Christmas, saving the agency on holiday pay and allowing it to shut
down certain operations at Kennedy Space Center for maintenance,
McCartney said.
   ``But we will not cut down on the normal inspections and data
that we look at,'' he said.
   Columbia will carry the $150 million Astro observatory aloft
during its mission. The shuttle, like Atlantis, was grounded since
the summer by hydrogen leaks. Both shuttles were cleared for flight
after fueling tests last month.
   McCartney, meanwhile, denied on Monday that employee drug use is
responsible for a series of accidents this year involving shuttle
equipment.
   A bag containing about a gram of cocaine was discovered under a
desk in a shuttle hangar on Friday. NASA is investigating the
incident.
   In analyzing the accidents, ``we have not found a common thread
that would cause you to think'' drugs are to blame, McCartney said.
   The latest accident involved a 9-foot beam that was left to
rattle around inside Atlantis last month, causing minor damage. In
addition, some of Columbia's hydrogen leaks were attributed to
improperly installed seals.
   ``I think you would like to be sure that all of the folks that
are doing any work on any flight hardware are in full command of
themselves, so it does concern me,'' McCartney said. But he added,
``It would be naive to think that with as many thousands of people
that we have here'' no one uses drugs.

<HEAD>New Community Service Requirement Lands School District in Court</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along with reading, writing and
`rithmetic, there's a new graduation requirement for incoming
freshmen at this city's two high schools this fall: community
service.
   The supporters of the requirement in the Bethlehem Area School
District say it will teach the basic American value of helping
others. Opponents, who are taking it to court, call it involuntary
servitude that forces ideals on students contrary to those of their
parents.
   ``Community service is a clear national priority that has been
voiced since President Kennedy's inaugural address,'' said Andrew
Faust, the school board's attorney. ``It's wrapped up in what we
think of ourselves as a nation.''
   Thomas Moralis, whose son David is a student, is trying to block
the program.
   ``I don't want my son being told what to do,'' Moralis said. ``I
went to school in a free America, and I want the same for my
children.''
   The suit, which isn't expected to go to trial before the middle
of next year, contends the student service program violates the
13th Amendment to the Constitution, which bans involuntary
servitude. It also says the program violates the 1st and 14th
Amendments by interfering with parental rights.
   ``Beyond the involuntary servitude, the parents object to the
philosophical underpinnings,'' said Robert Magee, attorney for the
Moralis family and another family. ``It's force-feeding a certain
set of values about altruism on children.''
   The school board voted in April to adopt the program, a concept
that has existed for years involuntary form in some schools across
the country and is now being pushed by legislation approved by
Congress.
   ``I think it's a contradiction of terms,'' said Michelle
Bennett, a student at Liberty High School. ``You shouldn't have to
volunteer, but it's a good idea to have it as an elective. I like
volunteerism because I've done it, but it doesn't make much sense
to make it a requirement because uninterested kids won't do as good
a job.''
   But another student, Gilberto Quinones Jr., disagreed.
   ``It'll give the kids more self-esteem and teach them values in
the work they're doing,'' he said. ``It will teach them how to act
maturely and they can learn and see if they like the work.''
   The Bethlehem district based its program, which requires 60
hours of community service, on one in Atlanta. Three other
Pennsylvania districts have mandatory student service programs, and
30 have voluntary programs, according to Dr. Joseph Bard of the
state Education Department.
   Other states moving ahead with student service programs, some
mandatory and some voluntary, are Maryland, Washington, California
and Minnesota, said John Brisco, director of the state's Pennserve
program, which encourages volunteerism and sponsors grants to
school districts that promote community service to keep students
from dropping out.
   ``I'm excited about this. It seems to work,'' Brisco said. ``It
helps kids understand why school is relevant to life, and it helps
some of them find an area in which they can be successful.
   ``For too many kids, school is a setting where they experience
failure. If you put them in a setting where they tutor kids or help
old folks, they become successful. Once you're successful in one
phase of your life, you start doing better at other things like
math and English. It's a contagion of success.''
   Nationally, an early voice for bringing community service into
the schools was Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The foundation
recommended in its 1983 report, High School, that service in the
community or school be required by every student.
   ``Young people should be given opportunities to reach behond
themselves and feel more responsibly engaged,'' Boyer testified in
March 1989 before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
``They should participate in the communities of which they are a
part.''
   Before its recess, Congress passed a $287 million national
service bill to promote voluntary community service, both for
youths and their elders.
   ``The call to service should come early, and it should be a
vital part of education for citizenship in every school system in
the nation,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a sponsor of
the Senate bill.
   The Bethlehem school board has issued a list of 95 local
agencies where students can fulfill the requirement, including AIDS
Outreach, the YMCA, the Special Olympics, the Girl Scouts, the
Easter Seal Society, Meals on Wheels, the local public television
station and a host of museums, hospitals and nursing homes.
   Also on the list is the school district itself, which wants
volunteers to read to kindergarten children.
   The program applies only to the 900 members of the entering
freshman classes at the city's two high schools, Liberty and
Freedom. They have until June 1995 to fulfill the requirement of 60
hours, or about 15 minutes a week, on weekends or during the
evenings.
   School officials insist they'll be flexible in deciding what
constitutes community service, and say they might approve something
like a student-organized carwash with the proceeds donated to a
charity.
   Guidance counselors will oversee the program and studenss will
be required to submit one-page reports on their service, how they
made a contribution and what they gained from the experience.
They'll receive half a credit toward their diplomas.
   ``The idea is to inculcate the value that there is something
good about doing something of value for someone and not receiving
pay for it,'' Faust said.
   Karen Ritter, vice president of Citizens Against Mandatory
Service in Bethlehem, said her group believes in voluntary - but
not mandatory - service.
   ``The whole thing is the mandatory issue,'' she said. ``Everyone
who is involved in CAMS is a volunteer in one organization or
another. My daughter worked with me in a soup kitchen.
   ``Bethlehem has a tradition of community service,'' Mrs. Ritter
said. ``Hundreds of kids are already doing this service. They're
doing it willingly because they want to do it. But once you mandate
something, it's no longer volunteering.''
   Supporters of mandatory service argue that an optional program
would be like preaching to the choir in church.
   ``Schools require a lot of things that they think are
important,'' Brisco said. ``They require English, math. When an
individual district mandates service, it says this is something
that we really value.''

<HEAD>Dairy Industry Jittery as Milk Prices Head Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milk prices paid to dairy farmers are going
down, and the trend is sending some tremors through the industry.
   Strong milk prices since late last year generated substantial
pressure for dairy expansion, but an Agriculture Department report
says this momentum will ``collide with the effects of dramatically
lower milk prices'' in the coming months.
   Total 1990 milk production is projected to be almost 148 billion
pounds, up more than 2 percent from last year. It also would exceed
the previous record output of 145.1 billion pounds in 1988.
   Despite the uncertainties, agency economists think 1991 milk
production will rise again, perhaps by 1 percent to 2 percent to
another record.
   Last week the USDA reported the October all-milk price average
at $13.60 per 100 pounds, down from $14.20 in September and $14.80
in October 1989.
   The report by the department's Economic Research Service said
that despite the downturn, overall milk prices in the
October-December quarter ``still will be relatively favorable'' in
relation to feed costs.
   Milk cow numbers in 1990 probably will average about the same as
last year's 10.1 million head, the report said.
   ``Most dairy farmers probably will enter 1991 on a fairly sound
financial footing,'' it said.
   The ratio of debt to assets has declined since the financial
crunch of the mid-1980s, and economists said that will help some
producers consider expanding their herds.
   ``On the other hand, producers generally have been conservative
about taking on new debt in recent years,'' the report said.
``Although 1990 milk prices have been high, they have also been
unpredictable, and the support price was much below market prices.
Expansion plans may well be tempered with considerable caution.''
   The 1990 farm bill sent to President Bush late last month
freezes the government's basic milk price support at the current
level of $10.10 per 100 pounds. But it also provides an assessment
on producers if government purchases of surplus milk exceed 7
billion pounds.
   According to the report, the decline in milk prices will put
pressure on profit margins as feed costs remain fairly constant.
   ``If milk prices fall as much as currently expected, returns
over concentrate (feed) costs will fall about a fourth from 1990's
near-record to the lowest level since 1978,'' the report said.
   The report added: ``This would be the largest proportional drop
in returns over concentrate costs during the post-World War II
years.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An Agriculture Department survey shows that
most shippers of farm commodities would like more competition in
setting ocean liner cargo rates.
   Martin F. ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick Jr., head of the department's
Office of Transportation, said most shippers want ``unrestricted
ability'' to negotiate freight contracts with individual carriers.
   The Shipping Act of 1984 reguaates ocean carriers and grants
them antitrust immunity to allow the carriers to form
``conferences,'' or cartels, to set cargo rates and apportion
markets.
   ``Our surveys showed that many shippers would like the
conference system eliminated,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``If conferences
are not eliminated, most shippers advocate increased competition
within the conference structure, through mandatory independent
action on tariff rates and service contracts.''
   A joint congressional and executive commission is preparing to
review the impact of the 1984 law on maritime shipping to see if it
should be retained, changed or eliminated, he said.
   The cost and quality of ocean liner service have a direct impact
on the competitiveness of U.S. farm commodities, Fitzpatrick said.
About $12 billion to $14 billion worth of products are shipped
overseas on liner vessels each year, with a freight bill of $2
billion to $2.5 billion.
   Cooperating in the survey were the United Fresh Fruit and
Vegetable Association; National Forest Products Association;
National Potato Council; Southeastern Peanut Association; and
Washington State University.
   Copies of the survey report are available from: Office of
Transportation, USDA, P.O. Box 96575, Washington, D.C. 20090. Or

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Honey production in the top 10 countries is
forecast to climb 3 percent this year to an estimated 750,500
metric tons, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   The Soviet Union leads the list with a 1990 estimate of 270,000
tons, up from 249,000 last year.
   China is second at 180,000 tons, down from 189,000 in 1989, the
report showed. The United States, with 82,000 tons, compared with
an output last year of 76,793 tons, is third.

<HEAD>Any U.S. Attack Likely Will Start With Air Attacks in Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American-led offensive to drive Iraq out of
Kuwait probably would begin with nighttime air strikes inside Iraq
to sever Saddam Hussein's links to his huge occupying army,
military planners and private analysts say.
   Such a campaign, launched with the allied forces now arrayed
against Iraq, would seek to exploit Iraq's weaknesses in air power
and its apparent vulnerability in Kuwait to a seaborne assault and
to naval bombardment from the Persian Gulf.
   President Bush has said repeatedly in recent days that he is
growing impatient with Saddam's continuing occupation of Kuwait,
though he has not decided to resort to military force. He has
stressed, however, that force remains an active option and that he
will not permit the Iraqi army to stay indefinitely in Kuwait.
   U.S. military officials won't discuss specific war plans, and
they stress that Bush, for now at least, has not changed their
mission: It remains the defense of Saudi Arabia and enforcement of
United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq.
   ``Our training patterns have not changed in any manner'' to
suggest preparations for an offensive campaign, an Army official
said Friday. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Military officials' recent comments make it clear they are not
enthusiastic about taking the offensive against Iraq any time soon.
They would prefer to wait until more American and allied ground
forces are in place in Saudi Arabia and more effort is made to find
a peaceful solution.
   A major reason for the reluctance is Iraq's apparent success in
fortifying its defensive positions in Kuwait, where at least
200,000 Iraqi troops are dug in. They are supported by an estimated
150,000 elite Republican Guard troops along key resupply lines
between Kuwait's northeastern border and the Iraqi city of Basra.
   Iraq's defensive position in Kuwait is described by military
officials as elaborate. It includes multiple layers of infantry and
barriers such as mine fields, earthen mounds and anti-tank ditches.
Behind these are mechanized units that can quickly reinforce the
front-line infantry and cover its flanks. And behind these are
mobile ``ready reserve'' units capable of counterattacking or
blocking a move by Saudi-based ground forces to go around Kuwait.
   Iraq also has an estimated 50,000 troops along its southern
border west of Kuwait. The Pentagon disclosed Friday that
``significant'' Iraqi forces also are deployed on the border with
Turkey, but that no buildup has been detected on the Syrian border.
   If Bush ordered an attack any time soon, U.S. commanders in the
field would have a wide array of firepower on which to draw, in
combination with a variety of air, ground and naval forces deployed
by Britain, France and about 20 other nations.
   About 240,000 U.S. forces are now in the Persian Gulf area, and
allied forces total more than 100,000. The Pentagon said it plans
to send as many as 100,000 more troops, but it would be several
weeks before they get there and get ready.
   Joshua Epstein, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think tank, said there is little doubt that American
forces now in Saudi Arabia could win a fight for Kuwait. The only
doubt is whether the cost would be acceptable.
   ``You can do an offensive and you can win, but it won't be
cheap,'' Epstein said, adding that estimates of probable American
deaths range beyond 10,000.
   In the opening phase of a U.S.-led attack, the U.S. Air Force's
radar-evading F-117 Stealth fighter bombers would play a key role,
carrying out simultaneous attacks on important military targets
inside Iraq. These targets probably would include command and
communications centers that are vital to Iraq's ability to respond
quickly and to coordinate a counteroffensive.
   In combination with air attacks, U.S. Marines would be expected
to attempt a seaborne assault on Kuwait City. A contingent of about
11,000 Marines afloat in the gulf are specially trained in
amphibious landings, forced entry and urban warfare. They currently
are taking part in an amphibious landing exercise on a beach in
Oman.
   About another 33,000 Marines are defending coastal routes in
northeastern Saudi Arabia.
   Jack Merritt, a retired Army general and now president of the
private Association of the U.S. Army, said a key to routing the
Iraqis from Kuwait would be cutting them off from resupplies and
from the Iraqi leadership in Baghdad.
   ``Psychology is on our side in this,'' he said, adding that
``The moment they feel they really have been cut off'' the Iraqi
troops in Kuwait lose their resolve.
   In an actual invasion, the Marine amphibious assault force would
reach the beaches at Kuwait City by landing craft, small boat or
helicopter under the cover of an aerial assault from Harrier jump
jet fighters and a naval barrage. Among the U.S. warships in the
gulf is the USS Wisconsin armed with 16-guns and Tomahawk cruise
missiles.
   Perhaps the costliest phase of a U.S.-led attack on Kuwait would
be the Army's effort to oust the Iraqis from their hardened
positions. The Pentagon estimates that Iraq has about 3,500 tanks,
2,200 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers and
2,200 artillery pieces in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   The United States has about 800 tanks in Saudi Arabia.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: How the Election Will Affect Congressional
Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tuesday's elections will affect the next
Congress beyond the marginal changes in the balance of power
between the two parties.
   Within the small world of the Capitol, the nationwide balloting
will be seen as a referendum on the Democratic and Republican
congressional leaders.
   Whether he deserves it or not, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., will find his stature enhanced if the Democrats, as
expected, take some seats away from the Republicans.
   In the Senate, where the Democrats now hold a 55-45 majority and
little change is anticipated, the results will boost either
Democratic leader George Mitchell of Maine or Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas, even if the lineup shifts by only a seat.
   The electoral glow - or pall - will in subtle ways color how the
Democratic-controlled Congress deals with President Bush over the
next two years. Less subtly, the changes could make it easier or
harder for Congress to override the president's vetoes.
   Foley, Mitchell and Dole will adjust, adapt and survive the
changes. There's no evidence that the outcome will shake them from
their perches.
   That's not so in the ranks of the House Republicans.
   The House GOP is facing its 18th straight election without
winning a majority. There's not a single House Republican remaining
from when they last won the majority in 1952.
   Last year, their bitterness was turned toward Democratic Speaker
Jim Wright of Texas, who was forced out of office following an
ethics investigation. This year, they're shooting at each other.
   Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., is running to unseat Rep. Guy
Vander Jagt, R-Mich., as chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee. Vander Jagt has held the job since 1975,
and Sundquist is counting on fellow Republicans to see another loss
of seats as a sign that Vander Jagt should go.
   But is Vander Jagt is the real target? Not likely.
   Ambitious GOP members are setting up for 1992, when many expect
House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., to retire after 12 years
as leader. With the nationwide redistricting, Republicans will
stand their best chance in a decade for a big gain in seats.
   That makes the NRCC a potentially great place to be, even if
Vander Jagt has never managed to take advantage of it. The chairman
of the committee gets to know all the potential new members in a
very intimate and positive way - he hands them money for their
campaigns.
   Mitchell is a former Democratic Senate campaign chairman, Dole a
former Republican national chairman, and Michel a former NRCC
chairman.
   ``It's an excellent springboard. You become the spear carrier
and you also then get the spears. And they appreciate you for it,''
said former Rep. Tony Coelho of California, who vaulted from
Democratic campaign chairman to House majority whip.
   So what is Sundquist's ultimate goal? Who is his ultimate
target? He won't say. But he doesn't have to.
   Sundquist's quest was unveiled last week not by Sundquist, who
intended to keep it quiet until after the election, not by Vander
Jagt - but by the staff of House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich.
   Gingrich would be Michel's natural successor. But he was elected
as the No. 2 Republican last year at least partly because of his
long-term plans for wresting control of the House from the
Democrats. A bad election result would be bad for Gingrich - unless
he can blame it on someone else.
   The Gingrich-Vander Jagt strategy: Seed a public spectacle and
then accuse Sundquist of hurting GOP election chances right before
the elections. Let Sundquist take some of the blame for losses that
many Republicans pin on Gingrich because he torpedoed President
Bush's budget.
   ``Anything that distracts is doing a disservice to Republican
chances this fall,'' said Vander Jagt, who went so far as to
compare Sundquist with Saddam Hussein.
   Regardless of who eventually gets the blame, the Republican
strife will make the Democrats look good in comparison, just as
happened in the just-ended battle over the budget. Whether they
deserve it or not.

   The 1990 elections are a dream come true for
political handicappers. There are 34 Senate races, 36 governor's
contests and 435 U.S. House contests on Tuesday's ballot.
   Here is the outlook for the closest races, according to a
state-by-state survey by The Associated Press:
   Alabama - Gov. Guy Hunt, the first Republican elected governor
in the state this century, is bidding for a second term and
narrowly leads Democrat Paul Hubbert.
   Alaska - As a Republican, Walter Hickel was Alaska's second
governor. Now he's back, running as an independent and leading
Republican Arliss Sturgulewski and Democrat Tony Knowles.
Democratic incumbent Steve Cowper is not running.
   Arizona - Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, a Democrat, leads
GOP developer Fife Symington, but polls have him below the 50
percent he needs to avoid a runoff. Incumbent Rose Mofford, a
Democrat, is retiring.
   California - The big race of 1990 is a megabuck contest for
governor between Republican Sen. Pete Wilson and former San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. A lot of polling with not much
agreement, but the latest surveys give a hairline edge to Wilson.
The result might have to await a count of absentee ballots days
after the polls close.
   Connecticut - Republican Lowell Weicker lost his Senate seat in
1988. Now he's running for governor as an independent and leading
Republican John Rowland and Democrat Bruce Morrison.
   Florida - Another high-stakes contest for governor. Republican
Bob Martinez was at the top of the Democrats' list of vulnerable
incumbents. Democrats got another boost when former Sen. Lawton
Chiles decided to challenge Martinez. Late polls said Chiles was
leading, but it's close.
   Hawaii - This usually Democratic state gives the Republicans
their best shot at picking up a Senate seat. Rep. Pat Saiki is
running a strong race against Sen. Daniel Akaka, who was appointed
to succeed the late Sen. Spark Matsunaga. Polls indicate the race
is a tossup.
   Idaho - Republican Sen. James McClure is retiring and Rep. Larry
Craig is favored to defeat Democrat Ron Twilegar in the Senate
race.
   Illinois - Republican Jim Edgar and Democrat Neil Hartigan are
running neck and neck to succeed GOP Gov. Jim Thompson. In the
Senate race, Democrat Paul Simon holds a wide lead over Republican
challenger Lynn Martin. Republicans had high hopes for this one,
but Simon proved stronger than they thought.
   Iowa - Republican Gov. Terry Branstad is holding off Democratic
challenger Don Avenson, who had strong support from abortion rights
groups. Iowans don't tend to re-elect Democratic senators but Sen.
Tom Harkin has a strong chance to break that tradition. GOP Rep.
Tom Tauke is within reach of an upset but has been unable to catch
Harkin in pre-election surveys.
   Kansas - GOP Gov. Mike Hayden looked like a sure loser to
Democrat Joan Finney a month ago. But her hard line against
abortion appears to have hurt her and Hayden had a narrow lead in
the latest poll.
   Kentucky - Sen. Mitch McConnell has led in all pre-election
polls over Democrat Harvey Sloane. But this is a strongly
Democratic state and Sloane is given a chance for an upset.
   Maine - Former Democratic Gov. Joseph Brennan wants his old job
back and is challenging his Republican successor, John McKernan.
Brennan held an early lead, but the race now is a tossup.
   Massachusetts - Home of the voter rebellion. Outsider Democrat
John Silber holds an uncertain lead over Republican William Weld in
the race to succeed Gov. Michael Dukakis. Sen. John Kerry, fighting
to avoid being swept away by the rage that toppled incumbents in
the September primary, has opened a 20-point lead over Republican
Jim Rappaport. They were tied in surveys taken right after the
primary.
   Michigan - Gov. James Blanchard is shaking off a challenge from
Republican John Engler. A new poll said Engler was leading by 14
points.
   Minnesota - Lake Wobegon gone berserk. Democratic Gov. Rudy
Perpich is viewed as potentially vulnerable to Republican Arne
Carlson, who got onto the ballot only five days before Election
Day. Carlson had lost the GOP gubernatorial nomination to Jon
Grunseth, who was forced out of the race a week ago after
allegations he swam nude with two teen-age girls and cheated on two
wives. The fallout from the governor's race is considered a factor
in the surprising vulnerability of incumbent GOP Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz, who's in a dead heat with Democrat Paul Wellstone. A new
poll said Boschwitz was pulling away.
   Nebraska - GOP Gov. Kay Orr once trailed Democrat Ben Nelson but
is now even up. In the Senate race, Democratic incumbent James Exon
appears to be pulling away from former Rep. Hal Daub.
   New Mexico - Former Gov. Bruce King, a Democrat, is leading
Republican Frank Bond, but not by much.
   North Carolina - One of the most watched races in the country is
the Senate battle between Helms and his Democratic challenger,
Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of Charlotte. Gantt has been
ahead in the polls, but the contest has taken a nasty turn in the
closing days.
   Ohio - One of the best Republican hopes for a gubernatorial
pickup is this contest between Republican George Voinovich and
Democrat Tony Celebrezze to succeed Democratic Gov. Richard
Celeste. The race has tightened in the past two weeks.
   Oklahoma - Democrat David Walters leads Republican Bill Price in
the race to succeed GOP Gov. Henry Bellmon.
   Oregon - Tight races for governor and Senate. Democrat Barbara
Roberts holds a narrow lead over Republican Dave Frohnmayer in the
race to succeed Democratic Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. In the Senate
race, incumbent Mark Hatfield was caught by surprise and is in a
tight race with Democrat Harry Lonsdale.
   Rhode Island - The outlook is bleak for GOP Gov. Edward DiPrete,
who trails Democrat Bruce Sundlun by 52 points. In the Senate race,
Rep. Claudine Schneider's challenge to Democratic Sen. Claiborne
Pell appears to have fallen short.
   South Dakota - GOP Sen. Larry Pressler leads Democratic
challenger Ted Muenster.
   Texas - Races don't get much nastier than this contest for
governor between Republican Clayton Williams and Democrat Ann
Richards. Williams once was far ahead, but the race suddenly closed
to a dead heat a week ago. Now Richards is trying to exploit the
disclosure that millionaire Williams paid no income taxes in 1986.
   Vermont - Former Gov. Richard Snelling once looked like a
landslide winner in his bid to get his old job back. But Democrat
Peter Welch has moved within striking distance.

   Political action committees financed by labor
unions, teachers and other interests are pouring huge chunks of
money into legislative races in about a dozen states that are
battlegrounds for congressional redistricting.
   ``We are under siege like I have never seen,'' said Pennsylvania
Senate President Robert Jubelirer. He and other Republicans are
trying to fend off a Democratic offensive to take over the state's
upper chamber.
   The stakes are high in Pennsylvania because state Democrats,
should they pick up three seats and wrest the Senate from GOP
control, could have absolute control in redrawing the state's
congressional districts next year. Democratic Gov. Robert Casey is
likely to roll to re-election and the Pennsylvania House is
expected to stay Democratic.
   Similar shootouts are occurring in other states that stand to
win or lose when 19 U.S. House seats change hands in 1991 because
of population shifts detected by the 1990 Census.
   Eight states are expected to gain House seats and 13 to lose
seats. In addition, political boundaries within every state will be
redrawn, regardless of whether the states win or lose seats.
   The national Republican and Democratic parties have invested
heavily in the states affected the most by redistricting. And each
side is getting reinforcements from its allies, with labor backing
the Democrats and business and conservative interests aiding the
GOP.
   State legislative races and gubernatorial contests are crucial
because those elected officials will control the highly political
process of redrawing boundary lines for congressional and state
legislative districts.
   Therefore, Tuesday's elections will determine whether Democrats
or Republicans get to draw the districts or whether the two parties
split the responsibility. By slicing up districts in either liberal
or conservative precincts, politicians can help the election
chances of either a Republican or Democrat.
   Legisatures draw up the lines. Governors are power brokers in
the process, too, because a governor of one party affiliation, a
Republican, for instance, could veto a plan drawn up by a
Democratic legislature.
   Most of the 19 House seats expected to shift will move from the
Democratic-tilting Northeast and Midwest to the more conservative
South and West.
   California, Texas and Florida - the big prizes on everyone's
list because they stand to gain as many as 14 congressional seats
next year - have attracted huge contributions from out of state.
   Democrats in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which
each stand to lose two congressional seats, are luring hefty
contributions as well.
   ``Reapportionment has been on everybody's mind for a very long
time in the labor movement,'' said Janice Lachance of the American
Federation of Government Employees.
   Tom Heoffler of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
said it is crucial for the GOP to hold its ground to keep the
Democrats from taking total control in many states.
   ``We're looking at a situation here where it's vital for us to
hang on to what we have just to be in a divided or split
position,'' he said.
   Tim Dickson, executive director of the Democratic National
Committee's redistricting arm, noted that efforts are just as
important in states that stand to lose House seats.
   ``It's like musical chairs. The music's going to stop when this
legislative session ends, and somebody's not going to have a
seat,'' Dickson said.
   Democratic priorities, in addition to capturing the Pennsylvania
Senate, include trying to reverse narrow GOP majorities in the
senates of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and New York.
   Republicans are trying to oust Democrats to gain control in the
senates of Florida and Illinois.
   Florida is an especially important redistricting battleground
because it also has a close governor's race. In California and
Texas, the gubernatorial races are attracting the most attention
because both have legislatures handily controlled by Democrats.
   Other legislative showdown states, although not necessarily key
in the congressional redistricting changes, are Arizona, where
Republicans hold a four-seat majority in the Senate; Colorado,
where Democrats hope to make a stab at the GOP's 13-seat House
margin; Idaho, where the GOP holds a four-seat edge in the Senate;
Washington, where Republicans have a one-seat advantage in the
Senate; and Oregon, where Democrats have just four House seats over
the Republicans.
   In state legislatures that share redistricting powers with
governors, Democrats had a big edge going into the election. They
control both chambers in 29 states, while Republicans hold a lock
on the statehouse in only four.
   Overall, there are more than 6,100 legislative seats at stake
nationwide on Tuesday.

   Anxiety over the Persian Gulf, anger over new
taxes and antipathy toward incumbents stirred up a crosswind that
has Democrats and Republicans nervous about Tuesday's House
elections.
   While Democrats are certain to maintain their lopsided majority,
several candidates for re-election are in trouble because of the
savings and loan debacle. And party officials have stopped talking
of substantial gains.
   Republicans once hoped to cash in on President Bush's high
popularity ratings. Now, with his poll standings in decline, they
seem more resigned to mounting a rear-guard action to limit losses.
Experts say there is little chance the Republicans will lose large
numbers of seats.
   For all the volatility on the political landscape, no one
expects a major power shakeup in the House, where the lineup going
into this week's elections showed 258 Democrats, 175 Republicans
and two vacancies.
   ``People are infuriated at `congressmen,' but they love
theirs,'' said James David Barber, a Duke University political
scientist.
   Former Cincinnati Mayor Kenneth Blackwell has a chance of
becoming the first black Republican in the House since 1935,
although he's in a tight race with Democratic Mayor Charles Luken.
And in another contest of note, socialist Bernie Sanders, running
as an independent, is in a tight race with Republican Rep. Peter
Smith in Vermont.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri predicted
Sunday the Democrats would pick up six or seven House seats.
   Ed Rollins, chairman of the House Republican campaign committee,
said that if GOP voters shake off apathy and turn out at the polls,
``our losses will probably be held to a single digit. If
Republicans are still turned off and don't vote ... the numbers
will get higher.''
   The House elections will for the most part hinge on 29 contests
where there is no incumbent seeking re-election. Eleven of those
seats were held by Democrats, 18 by Republicans.
   Democrats hope to pick up an open seat in Arkansas, where Rep.
Tommy Robinson, who switched to the Republican Party while in the
House, waged an unsuccessful campaign for governor this year.
They're also hoping to pick up seats in Rhode Island, Hawaii, Iowa
and Idaho, in districts vacated by Republicans seeking higher
office.
   ``Unless there's a military action in the Middle East, the
Republicans are going to be hurt because of the economy and
taxes,'' said GOP consultant Tom Edmonds. ``The end result of this
for Republicans is going to be poor.''
   Said Democratic consultant Frank Greer: ``I don't think there's
going to be big shifts, even though voter sentiments are strong out
there. The real fruits of this budget debate (for Democrats) might
not be felt until 1992.''
   In the last full week of the campaign, Democrats charged that
Bush used political appearances to launch daily broadsides against
Iraq's Saddam Hussein in an attempt to divert attention from
popular unrest over the tax hikes. But the president denied that,
saying, ``I'll repeat it today, I'll repeat it tomorrow and I'll
repeat it the next day.''
   Against the backdrop of new, tougher talk on the Persian Gulf,
more problems in the thrift industry and public backlash over the
slowing economy and heavier taxation, about 20 incumbents will be
particularly vulnerable on Election Day:
   -Democrat Frank Annunzio of Illinois and Republicans Denny Smith
of Oregon and Charles Pashayan of California are in trouble because
they have been linked to the savings and loan failures. Annunzio is
chairman of the House Administration Committee.
   -The re-election campaign of Rep. Arlan Stangeland of Minnesota
has been threatened by disclosures that the incumbent charged
hundreds of long-distance calls to a woman friend on his House
credit card. The woman was the office manager of a lobbying firm.
   -Several of the vulnerable incumbents are freshmen, including
Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga.; Peter Hoagland, D-Neb.; Jolene Unsoeld,
D-Wash.; George Sangmeister, D-Ill.; Bill Sarpalius, D-Texas; Greg
Laughlin, D-Texas; Craig James, R-Fla.; Ron Machtley, R-R.I., and
Smith in Vermont.
   -Two incumbents in Maryland and Virginia are in some trouble.
Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., has run into controversy about his
conscientious objector status during the Vietnam war. Dyson sits on
the House Armed Services Committee and talks tough on military
issues. In Virginia, Republican Stan Parris said he supported
Bush's veto of a civil rights bill because ``it is worse to
discriminate against majorities'' than against racial minorities.

   Senate incumbents toying with the idea of a
future presidential bid will be expected to turn in a strongpperformance
Tuesday - or spend the next two years wondering about
the consequences.
   ``Any re-election of a presidential hopeful under 60 percent is
a dangerous sign,'' said Larry Sabato, a political science
professor at the University of Virginia.
   The 34 Senate races featured on Tuesday's ballot include several
senators just struggling to stay in office. Those considered most
vulnerable are Republicans Jesse Helms in North Carolina, Mark
Hatfield in Oregon and Rudy Boschwitz in Minnesota and Democrat
Daniel Akaka in Hawaii.
   But would-be future presidents need to do much better than just
survive.
   They must produce a solid performance in a climate of
anti-government attitudes and typical voter apathy in an off-year
election.
   No Democrat has announced a '92 run for the White House, but
those most often mentioned are Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia, Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee and New Jersey's Bill Bradley. Republicans
thought to harbor presidential ambitions include Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas.
   All face little or no opposition in their re-election bids on
Tuesday.
   Bradley is expected to defeat Republican Christine Todd Whitman
easily, but he may not do so with 60 percent of the vote. He may
feel some of the anger the state's electorate feels toward
Democratic Gov. James Florio.
   The backlash against Florio for raising taxes after his election
last year has prompted cries for impeachment in some quarters and
general anger in others.
   A poll released over the weekend showed Bradley favored by 55
percent of likely voters and Whitman supported by 27 percent with
12 percent undecided.
   Nunn will have no difficulty in topping 60 percent: He's
unopposed in his bid for a fourth term. In 1984, the Georgia
senator manhandled his general election opponent, Jon Michael
Hicks, 80 percent to 20 percent.
   Gore, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in
1988, faces three challengers in his attempt to return to the
Senate for a second term. But neither Republican William Hawkins
nor two independent candidates has generated much interest.
   Gore is expected to win handily, but high percentages are key.
   ``Candidates in the Democratic Party have to have vast appeal in
the South,'' said James Thurber, director of the Center for
Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University.
   ``In the South, a higher percentage shows you're a winner,'' he
said.
   The lone exception to the 60 percent rule - essential for
Southern incumbents - is Texas. A finish in the upper 50 percent
range is ``perfectly acceptable,'' Sabato said, because the state's
electorate can be tough on its candidates.
   In 1988, Texas Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen finished with 59
percent of the vote to 40 percent for his opponent, Beau Boulter.
Gramm, who's expected to win easily in his re-election bid,
captured 59 percent of the vote in 1984.
   Aside from concerns about strong showings in off-year elections,
candidates sometimes have to contend with political ghosts.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., was forced out of the presidential
race in 1988 when charges of plagiarism surfaced. He has seen those
accusations resurrected in this year's election but is heavily
favored to win a fourth term over Republican M. Jane Brady.
   Because no candidate has declared presidential intentions for
1992, the attention also is focused on gubernatorial incumbents. At
least one analyst contends that those races - not the Senate
contests - are the ones to watch.
   ``The (Senate) election is not going to determine electoral
prowess. It's a non-starter,'' said Tom Mann of the Brookings
Institution, a private research group.
   Although Mann says the contest in New York for governor is a
non-race, he suggests keeping a close eye on how Democrat Mario
Cuomo wins and then handles the state's economic problems.
   Cuomo was considered a presidential contender in 1988 and his
name has been mentioned for '92.
   Mann also will be keeping an eye on Arkansas, where Democratic
Gov. Bill Clinton is strongly favored for re-election.

   Youngsters in Arizona don't have to wait until
they're 18 to vote. They can go to the polls in kindergarten.
   The ``Kids Voting'' program, designed to improve the way
Americans vote, believes in starting young.
   ``It's thrilling because it lets kids vote on things adults
do,'' says 9-year-old Stephanie Schwartz, who adds that she'll
probably vote for the rest of her life.
   Alyssa Martin, 16, said participating in the program has made
her more aware of political issues.
   ``Now I read the newspaper about the candidates and I want to
know more,'' she said.
   Kids Voting began in 1988 as a pilot program taking in parts of
six school districts; 30,000 children voted.
   Two years later, the program has grown to include about 200
school districts around the state. More than 600,000 youngsters are
eligible to vote.
   Voting booths for children in grades kindergarten through 12
will be set up at 1,797 of the state's nearly 2,000 precincts for
Tuesday's general election.
   Pupils vote with a special ballot in booths alongside the
regular voting booths at adult polling places. The results, which
will be tabulated by a private computer company, are expected to be
available on Wednesday.
   Marilyn Hawker, Kids Voting president and executive director,
said voter turnout in the 65 precincts in which children voted two
years ago was 3 percent higher than state and county election
turnouts. She expects the program to increase voter turnout
throughout the state this year by 5 percent.
   Laurie Delaney, a social studies teacher in Mesa, said some of
her students said their parents registered to vote for the first
time after the students became involved in Kids Voting.
   The ballot issues that the youngsters will vote on include
statewide offices, propositions and legislative races, plus some
student-related issues not on the adult ballots, such as linking
driving privileges with regular school attendance.
   In another effort to deal with civic illiteracy, millions of
junior and senior high school students and their parents voted in a
nationwide mock election last Thursday. They cast ballots on
individual state races as well as on general issues involving drugs
and defense.
   The idea for Arizona's Kids Voting program came during a 1987
fishing trip to Costa Rica, where the voter turnout reaches over 90
percent.
   Bob Evans, chairman of the Kids Voting board of directors, and
several others made a forced airplane landing in a village in the
small Central American country. They met a taxi driver who told
them of a childhood of voting alongside his parents in simulated
elections.
   Evans hopes the idea will overcome voter apathy.
   According to federal statistics, 50 percent of eligible citizens
don't vote in presidential elections and 70 percent don't vote in
local elections. Arizona ranked 36th in the nation in voter turnout
in 1988.
   ``Voter apathy is the worst disease that we have within our own
particular democracy and it has been a creeping disease over the
last 75 years,'' Evans said. ``We're hardly a government by the
people any more because there are so few people participating.''
   The program already has affected the governor's race between
Democrat Terry Goddard and Republican Fife Symington, both of whom
participated in a televised Kids Voting program.
   Goddard later issued a statement to clarify his position after
learning he appeared to be losing ground among the youthful voters
over his comments on year-round school, one of the student-related
issues on which Kids Voting participants will cast ballots.
   Goddard said during the broadcast that the United States might
have to adopt an intensive program such as that used in Japanese
schools. In his later statement, he said he didn't advocate keeping
students in school year-round but would like to see the facilities
have greater use.
   The Kids Voting program is expected to cost about $600,000, with
95 percent of the funding coming from private corporations,
primarily Arizona Public Service Co., Ms. Hawker said.

   Illinois law calls for mandatory retirement of
judges after they turn 75, but 76-year-old William S. White has
other ideas.
   ``I refuse to be mandatorily retired,'' says the appellate judge
in Cook County. ``I view it as a violation of federal laws against
discrimination on account of age.''
   White wrote to the Secretary of State's office to inform them of
his intentions, and the state Board of Elections certified him to
run for re-election.
   ``I'm having my credentials reviewed by the public,'' White
said. ``They're the people who hired me, and they are the people
who should decide if I'm too old.''
   Meanwhile, John P. Tully, a Democratic circuit judge, and Lester
A. Bonaguro, a Republican circuit judge, are listed on the ballot
for a seat that might not be open.
   Because the question of White's retirement couldn't be settled
in time, officials decided all the candidates would be on the
ballot and the issue would be settled later.
   If 60 percent of voters say White should be retained, the courts
will have to decide whether he - or the winner of the
Tully-Bonaguro race - will get the seat, Board of Elections
attorneys say.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Weicker Holding Lead in Gubernatorial Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former GOP Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.,
who is running an independent campaign to be Connecticut's next
governor, holds a solid lead over two rivals, according to a poll
published Sunday.
   But one out of every three voters still is undecided, according
to The Hartford Courant-Connecticut Poll of 729 people.
   The survey showed Weicker favored by 34 percent, Republican Rep.
John G. Rowland favored by 23 percent, Democrat Bruce A. Morrison
favored by 10 percent, and 34 percent undecided. The margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   When undecided voters were pressed to choose a candidate,
Weicker's support grew to 42 percent, Rowland's grew to 29 percent,
and Morrison's to 15 percent, with 14 percent still undecided.
   The poll, taken by telephone from Oct. 29 to Nov. 2, surveyed
people who said they certain to vote Tuesday.
   Weicker seemed happy with the poll results, but reminded
reporters that he learned to distrust polls when he narrowly lost
his Senate seat in 1988 to Democrat Joseph Lieberman.
   ``Let's face it - I couldn't ask for more,'' he said. ``But I'll
be honest with you. After the last election, I don't put much stock
in polls.''

   Democratic gubernatorial nominee Theo
Mitchell says party leaders ``tucked their tails and ran'' from his
underdog campaign to defeat Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   ``I was criticized because I didn't ask permission to get into
it from the so-called leaders of the Democratic Party, to lick
their boots so I could run,'' Mitchell said.
   The state senator, bidding to become the nation's second elected
black governor, said he told party leaders he was going to run
``since no one else had the guts.''
   Mitchell told The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer in an interview
published Sunday that some Democrats have tried to sabotage his
campaign.
   Carol Khare, a Democratic National Committee member from South
Carolina, says Mitchell spurned offers of help from politically
experienced party members after he won the nomination.
   ``Party leaders who thought Theo didn't have much chance to win
still wanted him to do well, both as the party's nominee and as a
representative of blacks,'' Khare said. ``The Democratic leadership
wanted to help more than they were allowed to help.''
   Mitchell denies that he refused to ask for help or heed advice.
   Democratic activists say Mitchell has failed even to mobilize
his prime constituency and ensure a large black turnout.
   ``He doesn't have an organization that can turn out people,''
said Oscar Butler, dean of students at South Carolina State College
and a longtime Democratic activist.

   In years past, Kremlinologists seeking clues to
Soviet politics scrutinized the lineup of leaders atop Lenin's
mausoleum during the Revolution Day parade through Red Square.
   During this Wednesday's celebration of the Communist holiday,
those wanting to know the political currents will look instead to
the counterdemonstrations in Moscow's streets.
   For the first time in the 73-year history of the day marking the
revolution that brought Bolsheviks to power in Russia, alternative
demonstrations have been officially sanctioned in the capital.
   About 5,000 people marched in an unofficial protest on
Revolution Day last year. This year's alternative demonstration has
the blessing of the Moscow City Council, where radicals won seats
last spring.
   Sunday's editions of Moskovskaya Pravda, the capital's Communist
Party newspaper, stated joyfully, ``Today we may firmly declare
that the celebration of the anniversary ... will go on as usual.''
   The celebration will go on, but it won't be a ``usual''
Revolution Day.
   While the Communist Party puts on its grand show praising the
1917 uprising and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of
perestroika, protesters elsewhere in the city will be denouncing
the ``coup'' engineered by Vladimir Lenin and mourning those killed
during seven decades of repression.
   Demonstrators chose a symbolic route for their march: starting
at the Communist Party's Central Committee headquarters at the Old
Square, past a monument to Stalin's victims, and ending at the
house where the late human rights activist Andrei Sakharov lived.
   ``Our main slogan is, `From a totalitarian regime, to democracy
and humanism,' and we want to display this slogan to the whole
world,'' said Lev Shemayev of the Moscow Voters' Association, which
has organized anti-communist rallies this year.
   In outlining the plans at a news conference last week, he
emphasized that one target of the protest would be Gorbachev.
   ``It is clear that everything stems from the walls of the Old
Square, where the president has his study,'' he said, referring to
Gorbachev's office as chief of the Communist Party.
   Another group of protesters, led by radical deputies of the
national and Russian parliaments, plan to march through Red Square
carrying signs demanding the resignation of Gorbachev, Defense
Minister Dmitri Yazov and others.
   This march is scheduled to occur long after Communist Party
supporters and military hardware have paraded over the cobblestones
of Red Square. Gorbachev and the rest of the Soviet leadership will
have left their reviewing stand atop the mausoleum.
   Radical leaders such as Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov and Leningrad
Mayor Anatoly Sobchak initially urged that no festivities be held,
saying the communist system has been so destructive there is
nothing to celebrate. Many of the 15 republics, including the
Baltics, voted to ban traditional parades.
   Gorbachev, however, ordered the parades to go on in major
cities, and the national parliament echoed his sentiments.
Moskovskaya Pravda has been printing letters from party members,
war veterans and others in support of celebrating ``the glorious
date.''
   A group of Moscow war veterans criticized those who would cancel
the festivities, saying ``the attempts to deprive the Soviet people
of their national holiday are blasphemous.''
   Newspapers have reported on efforts to swell the ranks of the
pro-Communist Party parade, with Soviet army officers ordering
soldiers to march in street clothes, and military-affiliated
schools compelling students to fall in step.
   With the official parade still on, some radicals felt that to do
nothing ``would be a political mistake because it will play into
the hands of the party,'' and give the impression that all Soviet
people support the Communists, Shemayev said.
   Not all the radicals agree.
   Popov said last week: ``I am not going to march in any
demonstrations, although I will attend the official state
ceremonies related to Nov. 7.''
   The national parliament had urged that alternative
demonstrations not be held, but opposition groups decided to defy
the lawmakers and the City Council approved.
   Lev Ponomarov, a radical deputy to the Russian Republic's
parliament, sounded defensive Friday in announcing protest plans.
   ``It is not us who initiates these demonstrations. ... We are
forced to participate ... because we want to express a different
viewpoint,'' he said.
   Shemayev stressed that the ``national reconciliation'' of
Communists and non-Communists was another principal theme of the
day.
   ``We must emphasize the main philosophy that we are all now
within the confines of the barbed wire of the Soviet Union,'' he
said, ``and we are all countrymen, whether we like or loathe each
other.''

<HEAD>Saudis Don't Want War, But Are Resigned to It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Abdel-Aziz won his desert realm
by the sword, but his heirs have favored diplomacy over violence
for decades. Now they are resigning themselves to the possibility
of war with Iraq.
   ``If there's no peace, I'd rather have war than have Saddam
Hussein threatening myself and my children,'' said a Saudi sheik
who lived through Riyadh's transformation from backwater to
glittering metropolis.
   Recounting the rags-to-riches story of his generation, the
middle-aged sheik-businessman said ``nobody wants war'' but
everyone is becoming resigned to it.
   Few signs of impending war are evident in this city of
superhighways, but posters telling what do in an air raid can be
found at traffic intersections among the modern buildings, myriad
princely palaces and shiny mosques.
   Stay at home, they urge. Use minimum lighting. Place yourself in
a corner or go underground if you have a basement. Listen carefully
to radio or television. Be calm and behave wisely.
   Abdel-Aziz bin Abdel-Rahman al Saud, after years of exile in
Kuwait, stormed out of the desert in 1902 with a few hand-picked
companions and took the fort at Riyadh in a daring dawn raid.
   Within two decades, he controlled most of the Arabian Peninsula.
   His victory was so complete that war on their own soil is
something only very old Saudis can remember, and only dimly.
   Out at Diriyah oasis, where the ultra-conservative Islamic sect
known as the Wahabis joined forces with Abdel-Aziz's ancestors to
plan an earlier conquest of Arabia in the 18th century, cats slink
across empty streets as the sun sets over the desert.
   Behind a dense palm grove are the big-walled compounds where
some of the wives of senior princes live. Al-Turaif Citadel, a
mud-brick fort that guarded the entrance to the oasis, is being
restored as a historic monument.
   Modern-day Saudis live in the sprawl of Riyadh, the capital,
which is laid out in a grid pattern across the flat desert. They
seldom visit the citadel, a relic of the warrior past.
   A Jordanian businessman, who like the saudi sheik spoke on
condition of anonymity, told of noticing fear in many Saudis
immediately after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``Over the past 20 years, the people have been living in
luxury,'' he said. ``All of a sudden, they were in a war mood.
   ``They're very afraid of Saddam. They have seen the Kuwaitis
coming here, sleeping in schools, five to a room. They're worried
it could happen to them.''
   ``In the early days of the crisis, they packed their houses with
food, water and so on,'' the Jordanian said, but now they are more
relaxed and ``there's no such mood.''
   Whatever the people's private fears, their ruler insists that,
through diplomacy or war, Saddam be driven out of Kuwait.
   King Fahd bin Abdel-Aziz, the current successor of Abdel-Aziz,
is one of his more than 30 sons. Fahd also is known as Custodian of
the Two Holy Shrines, Mecca and Medina.
   In public statements, Fahd has demanded unconditional withdrawal
from Kuwait and ruled out any compromise that would leave parts of
the tiny emirate under Iraq control.
   Saudi Arabia, which has been reluctant to thrust itself onto the
Arab or international scene, is assuming a greater role now and
seems less willing to compromise with its neighbors.
   When King Hussein of Jordan refused wholehearted backing of
anti-Iraqi measures, the kingdom criticized him severely and, for a
time, closed the border to commercial traffic.
   When Yemen gave partial support to Saddam, the Saudis expelled
hundreds of thousands of Yemeni workers, many of whom had been in
the kingdom 30 years or more.
   A Western diplomat said the new policy was: ``No more Mr. Nice
Guy. No more throwing of money at problems until they go away.''
   Among the Saudi middle class, he said, there is a ``growing
debate about, `Is it worth going to war?' Also, if you go after
Saddam, does he have to be personally eliminated or could he just
be defanged?''
   The sheik-businessman said: ``If there is a war, the impact will
last many years. The Americans, the British will stay for a while,
then they'll leave, but the Iraqis will be there forever.''
   He said there was only one good solution: ``We wake up tomorrow
and Saddam Hussein has had a heart attack and been toppled by
someone less dangerous.''

<HEAD>In this Corner: Jesse `The Body' Ventura a Contender in
Mayor-Mania</HEAD>

   Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura was in an
ugly mood.
   ``Politics is dirtier than pro wrestling,'' he fumed, and he
ought to know.
   The candidate for mayor of this Minneapolis suburb is a retired
pro wrestler.
   What ticked him off one week before the election was a political
body slam -or maybe it was a headlock - from a state lawmaker.
   Rep. Linda Scheid wrote a letter to the community newspaper
publicizing excerpts from Ventura's interview with Penthouse
magazine last year and accusing the candidate of insulting women
and of being a bad role model.
   The lean and chiseled, 6-foot-4 candidate was outraged.
   Politics is ``dirtier than anything,'' Ventura said. ``I mean,
including wheeling and dealing in Hollywood. They're even more
honest than politics is.''
   Retired from the ring since 1986, Ventura, 39, is trying to
unseat 18-year Mayor Jim Krautkremer in this bedroom community of
50,000.
   Ventura, who wore a goatee, earrings and feather boas during his
wrestling days but now dresses more sedately and is cleanshaven and
graying about the temples, had feared character attacks during the
campaign. But he said the worse he had been called publicly before
Scheid's letter was a ``bit-part actor.''
   He appeared in two films with Arnold Schwarzenegger,
``Predator'' and ``The Running Man,'' appeared in other films and
did a never-aired ABC pilot, ``Tag Team.'' He also is color
commentator for football's Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
   In the interview in Penthouse's March 1989 issue, Ventura said,
``I just want to be the actor who, when a scene's done, heads back
to his air-conditioned trailer, picks up a Penthouse, looks at the
pictures, and maybe even reads the articles.''
   On why he chose the villainous role of ``The Body'' as a
wrestler: ``I identify with that role perfectly, because I am
eccentric and I am a maniac.''
   Scheid recommended in her letter that Ventura ``pick up some
sensitivity handbooks.''
   ``Sorry, Jesse Ventura, but our city doesn't need a mayor who
flaunts an image of macho indifference to half of our population,''
she wrote.
   Ventura got involved in politics when the city proposed real
estate development in a marsh near his house. He and his neighbors
wanted to save the wetland.
   He is campaigning for slow-growth development, expanded
recycling and a two-term limit for city officials.
   His campaign slogan? ``If you've had enough and you're mad
enough ...''
   The two candidates have never debated. The race for the
four-year office has been waged mostly through yard signs.
   ``He has never been involved in our community except for that
neighborhood thing,'' said Krautkremer, who advocates more
aggressive development. ``He doesn't realize the commitment he's
making.''
   Still, he acknowledged Ventura could be a threat.
   ``He's been doing this for a year and a half and I don't have
the ability to come up with these one-liners that he does,''
Krautkremer said.

   Elizabeth Taylor will sell a van Gogh painting
that could bring her nearly $20 million, Christie's auction house
says.
   The painting cost about $257,000 when the actress' art dealer
father bought it on her behalf in 1963.
   The painting, ``A View of the Asylum and Chapel at Saint-Remy,''
was done in 1889. It depicts the asylum the artist entered after
cutting off part of his ear. Van Gogh killed himself the following
year.
   When Miss Taylor was married to actor Richard Burton, the
painting hung in the couple's home in Gstaad, Switzerland, and in
the salon of their yacht.
   The painting will be sold at auction Dec. 3 in London,
Christie's said Sunday.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) - Britain's Duchess of York toured a
children's hospital today on the first official engagement of a
four-day visit to Australia.
   The wife of Prince Andrew was invited to Australia by the Royal
Flying Doctor Service, which brings medical supplies and care to
the country's outback.
   The duchess stopped to talk with dozens of children, speaking in
French at one point to a 6-year-old girl.
   She will travel to Melbourne on Tuesday for the Melbourne Cup
horse race, Australia's biggest turf event, and leave the country
Thursday.

   NEW YORK (AP) - It took six albums over 12 years, but country
singer Carlene Carter is finally making it big like the rest of her
famous family.
   ``I always thought it would work out,'' Carter, 35, said in the
Nov. 12 issue of People magazine. ``But I didn't think it would
work out so late in life.''
   Carter is the daughter of June Carter Cash and '50s Nashville
crooner Carl Smith.
   But not even her stepdad - Johnny Cash - or her third husband -
British rocker Nick Lowe - could jumpstart a career that saw her
first five albums go nowhere.
   Now she's back to country music and has a No. 1 hit, ``I Fell in
Love,'' and a Top 20 album of the same name.
   ``There was a period where I was a little scared that I'd blown
my chance,'' she said. ``But I think everything that I did, every
step I took, every wrong turn led to this.''
   Johnny Cash's daughter, Roseanne Cash, is also a popular country
performer.

   NEW YORK (AP) - ngie Dickinson says she and her two sisters
were never close while trying to survive life in North Dakota with
an alcoholic father.
   But all that has changed for the 59-year-old actress now that
she's taking care of her sister Mary Lou, 61, who has Alzheimer's
disease.
   ``I'd made my own diagnosis of Alzheimer's. I'm a news junkie
and I read a lot of medical stories,'' Dickinson said in the Nov.
12 issue of People magazine. ``In 1986 I told Mary Lou that I
thought she might have Alzheimer's. I hope I didn't frighten her.''
   The Los Angeles-based actress oversees the care required by Mary
Lou, who has lost the ability to bathe, dress and feed herself.
   Dickinson also has persuaded her sister's three adult children
to enroll in support groups for families of Alzheimer's victims.
And she takes her to movies and baseball games even though ``I know
she can't see the ball or the batter.''
   ``But she enjoys the ambience, being there with me,'' the
actress said. ``It's all very momentary, but the moments are
worthwhile.''

<HEAD>Paroles on the Rise as Prisons Move to Ease Crowding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increase in the number of convicts paroled
last year reflects efforts by the criminal justice system to make
room for a similar rise in individuals sent to prison, authorities
say.
   The number of parolees increased 12.1 percent to 457,797,
coupled with a 5.6 percent rise in defendants on probation to a
total of 2.52 million, according to a fresh study from the Justice
Department.
   Authorities were unanimous in saying states have used parole to
reduce overcrowding, particularly when courts have set caps on the
number of inmates that can be housed in particular prisons.
   Georgia led the nation with a 54.2 percent increase in paroles
in 1989.
   The state's parole board releases non-violent offenders to avoid
prison overcrowding and lawsuits, spokesman Mike Fleming said.
   The rise in paroles ``is simply a reflection of the board's
attempt to maintain the level of the prison population in the state
of Georgia,'' Fleming said. ``We're trying to keep it at capacity
or less so that we don't get into federal lawsuits or federal
control.''
   In Oregon, paroles climbed 52.9 percent last year, followed by
increases of 37.1 percent in Kansas, 37 percent in Oklahoma and
28.8 percent in Michigan.
   The Justice Department found that three-quarters of the 4.1
million adults under the authority of correctional, parole or
probation officials last year were living in the community rather
than behind bars.
   With more prison admissions, state officials have to find a way
to release inmates to make more space for newly convicted inmates.
   The 13 percent growth in the nation's prison population last
year tracks the 12.1 percent increase in parolees, said Lawrence A.
Greenfeld, who supervised the study for the Justice Department's
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   ``It's been that way for quite some time,'' Greenfeld said.
``All of these components of corrections are growing more or less
at similar rates.''
   Prison and jail populations since 1980 have increased 114
percent, while the number of those on parole went up 107 percent,
he said. The number of individuals placed on probation increased
126 percent, he said.
   According to criminologist Norval Morris, the latest parole
figures ``are descriptive of a system in chaos.''
   Wide use of mandatory sentences for drug offenses and other
crimes has strained prisons and forced parole boards to release
more inmates, the University of Chicago scholar said.
   ``When you put a cap on facilities and fill them up with
street-level drug dealers and users, you've got to do something,''
he said.
   ``Overcrowding doesn't produce more severity, it just produces
more random severity and random leniency,'' said Morris. He
recently co-authored a book, ``Between Prison and Probation,'' that
urges alternatives to incarceration.
   Texas had the largest number of parolees last year - 91,294-
followed by 57,508 in California. Pennsylvania ranked third with
47,702. New York had 36,685.
   Rhode Island had a 24.5 percent jump in the number of
probationers, followed by increases of 16.7 percent in Oregon and a
16.3 percent increase in Florida.

   The opening of the Berlin Wall did far more than
allow East Germans to dance across broken concrete into the
dazzling world outside. It let the outside world come in.
   Less than a year later, two nations were wiped off the map and
replaced with one.
   Breaching the barrier was a desperate act by a dying regime
trying to placate a people massed in revolt.
   Although the opening of the wall Nov. 9, 1989, took the
unromantic form of lifting travel restrictions, everyone recognized
it as the end of the Cold War's most famous symbol. It was the
dominant image in a breathtaking year of revolution in the Soviet
bloc.
   What no one predicted was the resulting maelstrom of forces that
led to German unity, an inexorable process that forced the
superpowers to recognize a new world order and reach new levels of
cooperation.
   Today, the nation that built the Berlin Wall is a territory
transformed, no longer a Communist state, no longer a closed
society, no longer a nation.
   It is a region whose destiny lies completely in the hands of
people who live in what used to be another country.
   Uniting with mighty West Germany has given the East Germans an
experienced hand to lead them and a mattress stuffed with money to
rest on.
   But it also has forced the old nation to make Eastern Europe's
fastest, most turbulent, most radical transition to a free-market
democracy after four decades of sleepy, unchanging communism.
   Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary are
proceeding much more gently, by comparison dipping a toe into the
cold waters of capitalism as they peer through the dust and smoke
of their revolutions.
   So swiftly has East Germany become distinct from its neighbors
that ``it is inaccurate and unfair to even compare them,'' said
Heinrich Vogel, an analyst at the Federal Institute for Eastern
Economic and International Studies in Cologne.
   He said eastern Germany is in ``a distinctly privileged
situation,'' sharing a language, legal system, government, currency
and borders with a rich and stable region.
   East Germany also has thrown its fate to the West, however,
while the other former Soviet satellites still have autonomy and
some control of their destiny on the longer, less certain road to
prosperity.
   What eastern Germany has in common with the other former
Communist states are profound similarities in public mood.
   ``They are all sharing exaggerated expectations to a large
extent,'' Vogel said. ``They have all inherited the structural
handicaps, the mental decay, the system of mistrusting each other
and society.''
   In eastern Germany, Westerners have seized control swiftly, from
the man in charge of selling its factories to the governor of its
largest state to clever squatters who have claimed its vacant
tenements.
   Leading eastern politicians have western campaign managers and
aides. The East German women's swimming team, which dominated the
world for years, has a West German coach.
   Children who have been drilled their entire classroom lives in
the correctness of communism are using western textbooks.
   The food in the old nation's stores, the cars on its streets,
the money in its banks and the flag flown atop its public buildings
- all have changed in th single year from revolution to
reunifiction.
   Political extremism, overt racism, crime and drug abuse have
crept through the wall or simmered up from the darkest corners of a
long-suppressed national psyche.
   Embracing the West has ruined the homegrown economy and its
overstaffed, inefficient enterprises, which once were the strongest
of the Soviet bloc but now are literally being killed by the
competition.
   Since March, about one-fourth of the 8 million workers in
eastern Germany have lost their jobs or are working fewer hours at
lower, government-subsidized wages.
   A recent report by the five leading German economic institutes
said nearly 4 million could be in the same situation next year, and
that the pace of recovery was much slower than expected.
   Except for some perky areas of the service industry, virtually
no sector of the eastern economy can survive without western help,
said economist Heine Flassbeck of Berlin, one of the report's
authors.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, facing national elections
Dec. 2, has dismissed the report as too pessimistic.
   Hans Peter Stihl, president of the German Chamber of Commerce,
said a new survey showed half of all western German businesses will
have invested in the east by the end of 1991.
   If there is disagreement over the timetable for eastern
Germany's elevation to western standards, there is little doubt
about its inevitability.
   On a single day soon after the Germanys were joined Oct. 3,
three unrelated announcements illustrated why East Germany was more
fortunate than its old Warsaw Pact allies:
   -Mercedes-Benz said it would begin building cars at a struggling
East German truck plant near Berlin, saving or creating 6,000 jobs.
   -The government increased pensions to help 2.7 million retired
people pay higher prices and rents.
   -Another department announced plans to spend 10 billion marks
($6.5 billion) on fixing up 300,000 homes.
   Romania, Poland and the other former Communist states could use
a day like that, but many of citizens have decided not to wait for
it.
   Thousands of Eastern Europeans have poured into eastern Germany
in hopes it will be the new gateway to the West, creating a German
immigration crisis.
   Soviet soldiers, who once died by the millions fighting the
Nazis and now must leave the nation they conquered, are deserting
in hundreds and asking to stay.
   Even Jews, subjected to hideous crimes under Hitler, are
arriving from the Soviet Union in search of better lives.
   All this in a country millions of people could not wait to leave
last year, where pent-up desperation brought down the hard-line
Communist leader, Erich Honecker.
   The uprising forced his successor, Egon Krenz, to bow even more
to the masses and do the unbelievable: change history in a single
autumn day by opening the Berlin Wall.

   This is Jesse Helms country, a mostly
white, blue-collar town, population 23,000.
   In 1984, Salisbury and other small communities helped carry the
Republican senator to a narrow victory over the state's popular
former governor, James Hunt, in an expensive and brutal campaign.
   This year, Helms is counting on Salisbury again as he takes on
Harvey Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte and the nation's first
black Democratic Senate nominee this century.
   Statewide polls released over the weekend disagree on which
candidate is leading, but all say the race is so close that the
undecided vote will determine the victor.
   Eva O'Grady of Salisbury said she's concerned about Gantt's
big-city connections, but she's also pro-choice and opposes Helms'
stand against abortion.
   ``I'm totally pro-choice and that may sway me,'' she said. ``I
change my mind everyday.''
   This has been another nasty election, with Helms attacking his
opponent's liberal record and Gantt charging the Republican with
playing on racial fears.
   Democrats on Sunday accused Republicans of racism during the
campaign, and a federal judge scheduled an election-eve hearing on
whether the GOP's voter mailings are intimidating voters.
   Salisbury, in central North Carolina, is 79 percent white and 20
percent black. Textiles are the primary industry.
   ``I don't really like the way either one of them's running their
campaign - all the mudslinging,'' said Donald Camp, 43, of Spencer,
a town outside of Salisbury. Camp said he'll vote for Gantt because
he has never liked Helms.
   Race is definitely not an issue among Salisbury voters, O'Grady
said. If anything, Gantt's appearance gives him an advantage, she
said.
   ``He's more charismatic, charming, upscale, yuppie,'' she said.
   But Jim Beck, 54, of Salisbury, said race is a factor because
Gantt has made it one.
   ``He's definitely for the racism,'' he said, accusing Gantt of
supporting blacks over whites. He said he would vote for Helms for
one reason - his 18 years in office. ``He's got experience, and
experience is the main thing,'' Beck said.
   Camp, Beck and O'Grady are white.
   Two students at Livingstone College, a predominantly black
school in Salisbury, said they believed most voters are concerned
with issues such as education and the environment rather than race.
   ``I don't think race has too much to do with it, but I think
it's an influence,'' said Janet Ferguson, 23.
   Her friend, Angie Ballard, 23, described Helms as a ``flop'' on
education. But she said she believed some voters would refuse to
listen to Gantt because he's black. ``The racial thing seems to be
coming back in 1990,'' Ms. Ballard said.
   Patricia Smith, who is 36 and black, said of the Democrat's
chances, ``I think it's possible he might win. A lot of things he's
for other people are for.''

<HEAD>In Final Push, Silber Attacks, Weld Questions His Temperament</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With polls showing the governor's race tightening,
Democrat John Silber is slugging as hard as ever. Republican
William Weld thinks his opponent is in danger of knocking himself
out.
   In a string of local and national TV appearances, the
hard-bitten Silber denounced one reporter, corrected another,
demanded an apology from CBS and said Weld would cry if he were
subjected to similar media scrutiny.
   On the CBS Sunday talk show ``Face the Nation,'' Silber told
reporter Leslie Stahl she had misrepresented his attitudes about
Jews, blacks and working women.
   ``The voters out there know perfectly well I'm totally in
control and I just nailed you for three distortions on which
somebody ought to nail you,'' he said.
   A stunned Stahl replied ``wow'' several times, observing:
``You're angry; you sound angry.''
   When it came Weld's turn to appear, Stahl asked, ``Are you going
to attack me?''
   The former federal prosecutor reserved his criticism for Silber,
suggesting, as he often has, the Boston University president is too
unstable to govern.
   ``Just because someone may demonstrate a lot of ill humor, that
doesn't prove they're going to have the ability to go and change
the system,'' Weld said.
   A poll released Sunday by the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV gave
Silber 44 percent to 41 percent for Weld, well within the margin of
error of plus or minus three points. Independent Len Umina had 3
percent, and 12 percent were undecided.
   Silber has led throughout in this predominantly Democratic
state. In a poll released last Tuesday, Silber had 46 percent and
Weld 37 percent. That poll had a four-point margin of error.
   Polls show Weld gaining support with liberal Democrats for his
views on abortion, the environment and day care.
   Silber, speaking on a local TV station, said later Sunday that
CBS owed him an apology for implying he believes Jews are racist
and for saying he offended women with statements about how the
feminist movement has led to child abuse.
   ``If anything were left of the libel laws and the laws of
slander, I would retire on the assets of CBS,'' he said. Silber
also said, ``If you beat up on Bill Weld a little while the way I
have been beat up on, I think he'll cry.''
   A CBS spokeswoman, Catherine Upin, responded, ``We stand by the
accuracy of our broadcast.'' Stahl had questioned Silber on
comments he made several years ago that he felt unwelcome at a
synagogue because his mother was not Jewish.
   As the campaign draws to an end, Silber has stepped up his
attacks on Weld, characterizing him as an ``orange-headed WASP''
and a ``back-stabbing SOB.''
   Weld countered over the weekend: ``The voters are considering
whether they want to be yelled at for four years. I don't think
they do.''

   Abul Abbas, the mastermind of the 1985
Achille Lauro ship hijacking, says Libya has expelled 145 members
of his radical PLO faction and closed down four training camps.
   Abul Abbas said in an interview on Sunday that the move was a
surprise to him and his wing of the Palestine Liberation Front,
which is widely considered to be a major terrorist organization.
   He said the ejection was unjustified and urged Libya's leader,
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, to reopen the camps and the group's offices.
   The government in Tripoli has not given an explanation for its
action, he said. Reports began to surface about a week ago that
Libya had expelled the Palestinians.
   Arab diplomats in Baghdad said the United States had asked King
Hassan of Morroco and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to press
Gadhafi to eject the group. Gadhafi is believed to want Libya's
removal from the U.S. State Department's list of countries
supporting terrorism.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat has also been pressed to dissociate
himself from Abul Abbas, who has one seat on the executive
committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Pressure to
remove Abul Abbas increased after his group raided an Israeli beach
in May, an action that led the United States to break off its
dialogue with the PLO.
   After the raid on the Israeli beach, Abul Abbas apologized to
Arafat, saying the PLO chief did not about the raid in advance. He
also said that civilianswere not targets in that raid, counter to
Israeli claims.
   Abul Abbas dismissed reports the PLO leadership had asked Libya
to kick out his group.
   ``We rule out any possibility that the PLO leadership has asked
for this, but some Palestinian circles who oppose our militant line
might have done so,'' he said.
   He said that most of the group had moved to Lebanon, and others
to places that he delined to name.
   Abul Abbas, whose real name is Mohammed Abbas, leads one of two
wings of the Palestine front, which split from Ahmed Jibril's
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in
1977.
   Based in Baghdad since leaving Lebanon in 1982, Abul Abbas is
believed to have several hundred guerrilla fighters in his
organization - in Iraq, Lebanon and, until now, Libya.
   The other wing of the Palestine front, based in Damascus, was
led by Talaat Yacoub, who died two years ago.
   Abul Abbas said two of the camps were places where PLO fighters
were trained for ``naval combat.'' One was a small town east of
Tripoli and the other was west of Tripoli, he said. He did not
provide the others' locations.
   The Palestinian leader said his group would continue its ``armed
struggle'' against Israel but insisted that the group will not
attack any targets outside of the Jewish state.
   Abul Abbas said that he had no plans to attack Americans or
other Westerners despite the Persian Gulf crisis. But he said his
group would fight alongside Iraq if it is attacked by the U.S.-led
multinational forces that have massed in the region in response to
Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
   ``In pan-Arab battles we will carry out our duties alongside our
brothers in Iraq,'' he said.
   The Achille Lauro, a Mediterranean cruise ship, was hijacked
Oct. 7, 1985 and held by terrorists for two days. A 69-year-old
wheelchair-bound Jewish-American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, was
killed during the hijacking and his body dumped into the sea.
   A Genoa court in 1986 convicted Abbas in absentia of
masterminding the hijacking. Abbas maintained had merely played a
role in negotiating the release of the ship in exchange for freedom
for the hijackers.

   Mary Martin was remembered upon her death for
a tomboyish charm and vibrancy that lit up the stage whether she
flew high in ``Peter Pan'' or sang to children in ``The Sound of
Music.''
   Martin, one of the New York theater's leading ladies for more
than 30 years, died of cancer Saturday at age 76 at her home in
Rancho Mirage.
   The actress captivated audiences with her spunk and her joyous
singing in such Broadway musicals as ``South Pacific,'' ``The Sound
of Music,'' ``I Do! I Do!'' and ``Leave It to Me.''
   ``Vibrant, exciting and always full of life, Mary gave her
millions of fans the world over some of the most memorable and
thrilling moments in the history of entertainment,'' said former
first lady Nancy Reagan, who appeared with her in the 1946 musical
``Lute Song.''
   ``The bright light and good cheer that Mary brought to the world
will not fade merely because of her absence,'' said William
Hammerstein, son of Oscar Hammerstein II, who wrote the lyrics for
``South Pacific'' and ``The Sound of Music.''
   Martin won a Tony Award for her 1949 portrayal of the naive Army
nurse Nellie Forbush in ``South Pacific.'' Martin sang some of
Rodgers and Hammerstein's most buoyant and warmhearted songs,
including ``A Cockeyed Optimist,'' ``I'm in Love with a Wonderful
Guy'' and ``I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair'' - during
which she washed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances.
   In ``The Sound of Music,'' which opened in 1959, Martin played
the irrepressible nun-in-training Maria and won another Tony. The
Rodgers and Hammerstein score included ``My Favorite Things,''
``Do-Re-Mi'' and ``The Lonely Goatherd.'' The show ran for more
than three years in New York.
   The role of Maria practically belongs to Julie Andrews, who got
the part in the movie, while the part of Nellie Forbush in the film
version of ``South Pacific'' went to Mitzi Gaynor. But the role of
Peter Pan is all Martin's.
   She was in her 40s when she played Peter Pan, the boy who never
wanted to grow up, on stage and television.
   ``All my life, I wanted to be Peter Pan,'' Martin once said.
``My poor mother never knew what I was going to do next. I don't
think anything ever surprised my parents. I was always doing
something strange - like at 5, jumping off the garage. I wanted to
fly, and all I did was break my collarbone.''
   ``Peter Pan'' opened on Broadway in 1954 and ran for 152
performances. It was televised live on NBC in 1955 and 1956. Martin
won Tony and Emmy awards for the role.
   With the advent of videotape and color, NBC taped ``Peter Pan''
in 1960 and last broadcast it in 1989. A videocassette was released
this year.
   Martin was born in Weatherford, Texas, and married Benjamin
Hagman in 1930. They divorced the following year after the birth of
son Larry Hagman, who plays J.R. Ewing on ``Dallas.''
   Martin left Texas to pursue a singing career in California and
made her debut as the Trocadero nightclub in Hollywood. It was
there she was seen by producer Charles Schwab, who put her in Cole
Porter's ``Leave It to Me.''
   The musical, which opened on Broadway in 1938, made her a star.
Each night she stopped the show by doing a coy striptease while
singing the musical's best-known song, ``My Heart Belongs to
Daddy.''
   Martin journeyed to California for a series of
less-than-memorable movie musicals and married story editor Richard
Halliday in 1940. They had one daughter, Heller. Halliday died in
1973.
   Martin was seriously injured in a 1982 taxi accident in San
Francisco that killed her manager.
   Her last show, ``Legends!'' opened in 1986 with Carol Channing
her co-star. It didn't make it to Broadway. ``It's one show I
didn't like,'' Martin said. She did it ``because Larry said to me,
`Mother, you've been off long enough.'''
   Martin is survived by her son and daughter, six grandchildren
and one great-grandchild.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

   The governing party's victory in a parliamentary
by-election helped boost the Japanese yen against the dollar and
push up stock prices in Tokyo today, traders said.
   The dollar closed at 127.35 yen, down 1.75 yen from Friday's
close of 129.10 yen. It opened at 127.20 yen and ranged between
126.75 yen and 127.55 yen in spot trading that totaled $13.56
billion.
   The dollar now has plunged 3.35 yen in the last two trading
days, but still is above its recent low closing of 124.40, hit on
Oct. 18 after a 13-day slide that totaled 13.55 yen.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party won a parliamentary
by-election Sunday despite widespread criticism of its proposal to
send troops to the Middle East for non-combat duties.
   In addition, dealers said, pessimism about the U.S. economy grew
after figures announced Friday showed U.S. unemployment still high
and leading economic indicators declining.
   This fanned fears that U.S. interest rates might be lowered
further, said Masato Hayashi, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
Lower interest rates tend to make a currency less attractive to
foreign investors.
   The dollar's decline was softened, however, by profiting-taking
on the rising yen, said Takeo Suzuki of Yasuda Trust and Banking.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
closed at 24,385.33 points, up 190.34, or 0.79 percent, from
Friday's close.
   The stronger yen and a sense of political stability after
Sunday's election encouraged investors, said Keiji Arai, a dealer
at Sanyo Securities.
   ``But share prices are not shooting up because market players
are cautiously waiting at the sidelines for the outcomes of two
other upcoming local elections and Tuesday's U.S. midterm
elections,'' he added.
   Yutaka Yoshino, a dealer at Nikko Securities, described the
day's trading as directionless and sluggish, with volume on the
first section a slim 220 million shares.
   The Nikkei index fell for four consecutive trading days last
week. The biggest dip, 898.94 points, came on Thursday.
   Yoshino said buying also suffered from investors' uncertainties
about both the American and Japanese government bond markets.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 85.05 points from Friday's
84.90-point finish. Their yield fell to 7.690 percent from 7.725
percent.

   Crews worked today to clean up about 49,000
pounds of sulfuric acid spilled from a tanker truck into a
tributary of the Ouachita River, officials said.
   ``It could possibly kill some fish and possibly some wildlife in
the area,'' said State Police Cpl. Janet Welch. State Police warned
against fishing in the creek and told cattlemen to watch livestock
along the water, she said.
   Welch said the truck crashed into a bridge over Blakely Creek
while trying to pass in heavy rain Sunday evening on Interstate 30,
about 15 miles from Malvern. The creek empties into the Ouachita a
mile below the accident site.
   The driver had only minor injuries and was cited for driving too

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's party broke
apart today, leaving the government in disarray in a country
already seriously shaken by Hindu-Moslem violence that has claimed
more than 330 lives.
   Hindu fundamentalists vowed today to dismantle 3,000 Islamic
shrines across India. They have been thwarted at least temporarily
in their campaign to replace a mosque in the remote northern town
of Ayodhya with a temple.
   The capital, meanwhile, was brought to a near standstill by a
strike called by the right-wing Hindu party that provoked the
political and religious crisis.
   Singh won the endorsement of more than half his Janata Dal
Party's members in Parliament, but a large dissident faction
deserted him today and named its own choice for prime minister.
   The dissidents elected Chandra Shekhar, a long-time Singh
antagonist, to lead them and said they would request that President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman ask their new leader to form a government.
   Whatever happens, Singh is likely to lose, since he faces a vote
of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
   The defection from Singh's governing coalition last month of the
Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party, inspired by the arrest
of its leader for instigating unrest in the Ayodhya dispute,
triggered the political crisis.
   In the capital today, Bharatiya Janata activists blocked traffic
by deflating the tires of trucks and buses that ignored their
strike call.
   Many shops were closed. In some areas, private cars and
three-wheel motorscooter taxis were halted.
   Police were deployed on major streets. Most parents kept their
children home from school, fearing trouble.
   Bharatiya Janata was protesting the killings by police of at
least 22 Hindu fundamentalists who were shot last week trying to
replace the Ayodhya mosque with a temple.
   Nationwide, more than 300 othe people have been burned,
stabbed, shot or hacked to death in Hindu-Moslem riots or when
police opened fire to disperse rampaging mobs.
   The position of the beleaguered Singh worsened today with the
resignation of a sixth minister in his 38-member Cabinet.
   Minister of State for Communications Janeshwar Mishra submitted
his resignation shortly before Singh's showdown with his Janata Dal
Party, United News of India said. The string of desertions began
nearly two weeks ago.
   The daily lurch toward disintegration leaves the entire
government in question. If the Janata Dal ousts Singh, it's still
questionable whether a new party leader can forge the coalition
support necessary to stay in power. India could then be headed for
new elections four years ahead of schedule.
   Ayodhya itself, the flashpoint for the sectarian dispute, was
calm this morning, a day after Hindu leaders suspended their
campaign to seize the mosque after claiming to have reached an
accord with authorities.
   But the stage was set for new confrontations between the Hindu
majority and the Moslem minority when a Hindu fundamentalist leader
vowed to dismantle 3,000 mosques nationwide and replace them with
Hindu temples.
   Ashok Singhal, general secretary of the World Hindu Council,
told reporters in Ayodhya that his group would beef up its militant
youth wing and expand efforts.
   ``Earlier we wanted three, but now, seeing the government
operation on Hindus, we have decided that we will dismantle 3,000
mosques,'' Singhal said.
   The mosques are those that Singhal and others feel are on Hindu
holy sites. The Hindus want a temple at Ayodhya to honor Ram, the
warrior-god who is one of the most popular Hindu deities.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party, which had tacitly supported Singh's
government since he took office as prime minister Dec. 2, 1989, had
fervently supported the temple-building project. Its leader, Lal
Krishna Advani, was arrested Oct. 24 while leading a caravan of
supporters across India to Ayodhya.
   The party promptly withdrew its support, leaving Singh and his
Janata Dal Party teetering.
   Today, Janata Dal's dissident spokesman Harmohan Dhawan told
reporters that 82 of the the party's 178 members in Parliament
unanimously chose Chandra Shekhar.
   But Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, a Singh supporter, said
113 legislators met separately at Parliament and voted unanimously
to support Singh. The figures could not immediately be reconciled.
   Janata Dal was created to unseat former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and his Congress Party, which had virtually monopolized
political power in India since the country won independence from
Britain in 1947.
   The party was united by little more than anti-Gandhi sentiments,
and the crisis in Ayodhya was all it took for ex-Deputy Prime
Minister Devi Lal, a top Singh foe in the party, and others to make
their move.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people, but in
close elections the Moslem minority of 12 percent is crucial.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the time the cheering stopped at Carnegie
Hall, one fact seemed indisputable: A lot of people are going to be
learning how to pronounce the name Hvorostovsky.
   That's Dmitri Hvorostovksy (khvuh-rah-STOF-skee). Occupation:
baritone. Place of birth: Siberia. Age: 28.
   In his Carnegie debut program of Italian songs and arias Sunday
night, Hvorostovsky deepened the impression he has created in other
concerts and on records. Here is a highly gifted young singer who
combines a naturally beautiful voice with unusual artistic
sensitivity and involvement.
   He devoted the first half of the program to art songs by early
Italian composers, including Pergolesi and Stradella. Hvorostovsky
was equal to their demands, whether the mood was light and playful,
angry or, more typically, melancholy.
   But these songs served mainly as a warmup for the second half of
the program, which featured several mainstays of the Italian
operatic repertory. Here Hvorostovsky thrilled his audience with
all the vocal power one could ask for and a range that carried up
to the A above middle C.
   There was some Donizetti, Riccardo's fiery aria from Bellini's
``I Puritani,'' and finally two Verdi showpieces - Miller's aria
from ``Luisa Miller'' and Rodrigo's dying ``O Carlo, ascolta'' from
``Don Carlo.''
   In this last number, Hvorostovsky's purity of tone was
astonishing, as was his ability to sustain a long, smooth line
without, apparently, having to stop for breath like other human
beings.
   Having roused the crowd to a fervor, he outdid himself in a
couple of encores. The Prologue scene from Leoncavallo's ``I
Pagliacci'' brought to mind the great Leonard Warren, who made the
part one of his specialties. An aria from Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of
Spades'' was heart-rending in its beauty.
   The excellent piano accompanist was Mikhail Arkadiev. It's no
criticism of him to say one longed to hear the singer accompanied
in the operatic selections by full orchestra.
   Hvorostovsky will be making his debut at several major opera
houses around the world in the coming year - La Scala, San
Francisco, Covent Garden. No plans have been announced yet to bring
him to the Metropolitan Opera, but the folks over at Lincoln Center
can ill afford to let this talent elude them for long.

   Necessity wasn't the mother of Gary Dimmick's
invention. A thief was.
   After someone stole a new suede coat out from under him at a
bar, a cold walk home inspired Dimmick to find a way to keep
jackets, purses and other hard-to-lock objects from being stolen.
   What Dimmick came up with was the Lock-Man, designed to fasten
objects securely to coat hooks or bar stools.
   Dimmick has invested more than $200,000 of his own money on the
device. He said he'll have to sell 100,000 of the devices, on store
shelves for a month, to break even.
   ``I'm over dreaming of being a millionaire,'' he said after
seven years of work. ``But it was a fun fantasy.''
   The Lock-Man, which is 6{ inches long and weighs 4{ ounces, uses
an aluminum cylinder containing a chain to wrap around a hook or
post. The chain can be looped and pulled tight and then attached to
whatever needs to be secured.
   ``It's not Fort Knox, but it's not supposed to be,'' said
Dimmick, 37. ``It's supposed to prevent casual theft - theft of
opportunity.''

   Leaders of the governing and opposition parties
both claimed an edge today in a hard-fought parliamentary election
seen as a referendum on the government's fading bid to send troops
to the Persian Gulf.
   The clearest signal, though, seemed to come from the huge
majority of voters who elected to stay home.
   The governing Liberal Democrats breathed a little easier after
the slim victory of Yoshihisa Oshima, a 50-year-old dentist, over
Socialist Party member Michiko Goto in the Aichi prefectural
by-election on Sunday.
   The party, however, backed away from calling Oshima's 45 percent
to 43 percent plurality an endorsement of its troop deployment
bill, which faces likely defeat in Parliament.
   The opposition parties were less shy. They said the upper house
election was a clear repudiation of the troop deployment proposal
because Goto and the Communist Party candidate, Yukiko Seko,
together tallied 55 percent of the vote, or 1,003,815 votes to
Oshima's 833,371.
   Furthermore, the opposition's strong showing came in what is
normally a governing party stronghold and the home district of
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, the bill's sponsor.
   ``This was proof that a great number of citizens oppose the
Self-Defense Forces deployment bill,'' said Kanju Sato, the
Socialist Party's election committee chairman. ``We will fight
harder to prevent the bill from being passed.''
   Kaifu, whose already weak prime ministership would have been
jeopardized by an election loss, issued an unusual statement
declaring, ``I'm so glad that we won as a result of the efforts by
the candidate and the entire party.''
   The prime minister twice visited Aichi, southwest of Tokyo, and
his party's secretary general, Ichiro Ozawa, went three times.
   More than 100 Liberal Democrat members of Parliament were sent
in to back the party's candidate, The Japan Times reported.
   Nonetheless, Sunday's voter turnout was just 38.7 percent of the
4.8 million eligible voters, one of the lowest figures ever in the
postwar period in Aichi.
   ``Japanese voters are most interested in bread and butter and
the bill has little to do with that,'' said Hideo Sato,
international politics professor at Tsukuba University.
   By-elections last year, when a consumption tax was the focus,
drew more than 60 percent of eligible voters.
   A special session of Parliament called to debate Kaifu's
``United Nations Peace Cooperation Bill'' is scheduled to end
Saturday. Ozawa, however, said it could be extended.
   ``The public does not sufficiently understand. If the government
makes a greater effort, I think we can gain support,'' said Chief
Cabinent Secretary Misoji Sakamoto.
   The opposition, and some members of Kaifu's own party, say the
proposal would violate Japan's post-World War II constitution,
which bans the use of force to settle international disputes.
   Kaifu has said the troops would be limited to non-combat roles.
He has been under pressure from the United States and other nations
that want Japan to provide more than money for the Persian Gulf
forces.

<HEAD>Fog Equals Fear for Residents Near Chemical Processing Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MULBERRY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fog brings fear for some residents of this
central Florida mining town, where state officials have measured
nine releases of dangerous ammonia or sulfur oxides from nearby
chemical plants since 1987.
   ``We've got a bad situation here and people don't realize it,''
said Wilbert Lancaster, a 27-year phosphate industry veteran whose
son was briefly overcome by ammonia fumes at Mulberry High School.
``What is it going to take to get them to do something about it? Is
somebody going to have to die?''
   More than two weeks after the last dense fog passed over
Mulberry, Fire Chief Mitch Carmack still had blisters in his mouth
- caused, he said, when he tried to take samples of the chemical
while wearing standard firefighting clothes. The fumes, he said,
ate holes in his shirt.
   The incident drew so many complaints to the city Fire Department
that dispatchers stopped logging calls. Firefighters used
loudspeakers for about two hours to warn hundreds of residents to
stay indoors. No one required medical treatment.
   Twenty people were hospitalized briefly from exposure to three
earlier toxic clouds, which can be created when phosphate is
converted from raw ore to fertilizer.
   The Department of Environmental Regulation or the Fire
Department has traced all but the latest cloud, on Oct. 21, to two
of the three area chemical plants.
   DER blames a Royster Co. chemical and fertilizer plant for an
Aug. 31 release and one in September 1989, when 17 high school
students and the school's ROTC supervisor were hit by a bluish
cloud of sulfur oxide.
   The supervisor, James Gandy, said he and the students coughed
violently and had teary eyes and trouble breathing.
   DER has negotiated several improvements at the Royster plant,
said Viet Ta, a DER enforcement engineer. The agency also is
considering installing an additional air monitoring device near
town.
   The company's problem is that its monitors showed nothing
unusual during either of those releases, said Royster manager Gary
Dahms.
   ``We're not denying it,'' he said, ``but we don't see how it
could have happened.''
   Royster has reimbursed all of those involved for their medical
expenses and is starting a training program for employees on
minimizing releases, he said.
   The company also has accepted responsibility for failing two
emissions tests and making two improper releases since 1986 and has
paid fines totaling $40,640 in settlements with DER.
   ``Even though we're legal, if we're making a smell, we're not
going to get by,'' Dahms said. ``We've got to be more careful.''
   The release of an ammonia cloud in February that hit a bus
driver and three passengers was blamed on the now-closed New
Imperial Phosphates plant.
   DER since has denied the plant permission to resume processing,
citing a lack of proper monitoring and alarm systems.

<HEAD>Report: Dinkins May Have Backdated Letter Used to Prove Stock Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins' office disputed a report
that federal prosecutors have evidence indicating he used a
backdated letter to prove he did not evade taxes on a stock
transfer.
   Spokesman Albert Scardino called the story in Sunday's New York
Newsday ``shameful and dishonest journalism'' based on ``unfounded
allegations,'' and the mayor's attorney, Charles Stillman, insisted
the letter is legitimate.
   The letter became an issue during the mayoral campaign last year
when Republican Rudolph Giuliani questioned whether Dinkins had
paid appropriate federal gift taxes on the transfer of stock in a
cable TV company to his son.
   In 1986, Dinkins said he transferred 588 shares of the stock to
David Dinkins Jr. at no cost. After Giuliani's accusation, Dinkins
said he had sold the stock to his son for $58,000 and thus wasn't
subject to gift tax.
   He released copies of a handwritten, unnotarized ``Dear Dad''
letter from his son - dated Oct. 30, 1985 - as proof of the sale.
   The fact that Dinkins had once valued the stock at $1 million
and that he failed to pay taxes for four years 20 years ago added
to the controversy.
   A federal investigation of the stock transfer ended in July with
no criminal charges, but a city probe continues.
   Newsday, citing an unidentified source close to the federal
grand jury that investigated the matter, reported Sunday that an
imprint of a phone number on the letter suggests it was written in
1988 or 1989. Investigators, though, could not prove it
conclusively, the source said.
   The number is that of a media-related company that the younger
Dinkins would have had little reason to contact in 1985, when he
worked as a producer for CBS Sports, the newspaper said. Dinkins'
son is now an independent TV producer and would have had reason to
dial the number in 1988 or 1989, it said.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney, in a confidential report
summarizing his findings for a special city investigator in July,
said he found ``substantial evidence'' the letter was not written
when dated, Newsday said.
   Maloney refused to comment on the grand jury proceedings.
   The mayor's son, who lives in Las Vegas, did not respond to
Newsday's requests for an interview.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators today reached a settlement
ending a strike by 8,000 Navistar International Corp. employees in
six states.
   Navistar spokesman Bill Greenhill said the employees who walked
out at midnight Friday after a contract extension ran out would
begin returning today. Navistar, formerly International Harvester,
makes trucks and diesel engines.
   The tentative agreement was reached about 3 a.m. after 19 hours
of talks between the company and the United Auto Workers, union
officials said.
   Details of the agreement were withheld pending a meeting of the
union bargaining committee on Wednesday, but Bill Casstevens, UAW
secretary-treasurer and chief negotiator, said the pact ``meets the
membership's needs for continued job and income security while
making important improvements in economic areas.''
   UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said a ratification vote could begin
this week.
   Workers in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, Maryland and Texas
were affected by the strike. McGhee said he doubted the strike had
caused any serious production problems because little work had been
scheduled over the weekend.
   Representatives met throughout Saturday and from about 8 a.m.
Sunday before reaching the accord, McGhee said.
   Talks had been held in Louisville since August in an attempt to
reach a contract to replace the 1987-90 agreement, which had been
extended since Sept. 30.

<HEAD>Parliament Orders Militias To Disband</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moldavia's parliament ordered all
militias to disband within 24 hours after its president urged
lawmakers to reconsider laws that have encouraged ethnic unrest in
the independence-minded republic.
   The speech Sunday by President Mircha Snegur marked the first
time the ethnic Moldavian leadership had accepted blame for
separatist movements in the Turkish-Christian Gagauz region in the
south and the predominantly Russian and Ukrainian Dniester area in
the east, lawmakers said.
   On Saturday, Snegur and representatives of the separatist groups
met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow and agreed to a
moratorium on the acts that helped precipitate the crisis.
   Details of the moratorium have not been worked out. Lawmakers
said it probably would mean the Gagauz and Dniester regions would
suspend their declarations of autonomy and planned elections.
   In return, the republic's government would soften a language law
that made Moldavian the national language and required people in
dozens of jobs, ranging from doctors to hairdressers, to pass tests
in Moldavian by 1995.
   The language law stirred resentment among Russian speakers and
the Gagauz, who speak a Turkic language and are descendants of
Christians who fled to Moldavia from persecution in Bulgaria in the
19th century.
   Both the Gagauz and Dniester separatists claim discrimination by
Moldavians, who themselves want independence from the Soviet Union.
   Moldavia, a republic on 4.3 million people on the Romanian
border, asked for help from Soviet Interior Ministry troops after
an Aug. 18 autonomy declaration by the Gagauz, who number about
150,000.
   After the president's speech Sunday, Moldavia's parliament
passed a resolution ordering all militias - Moldavians, Russians,
Ukrainians and Gagauz - to disband within 24 hours. Some units have
reportedly armed themselves.
   In neighboring Romania on Sunday, thousands of demonstrators
demanded reunification with their ethnic kin in Moldavia.
   About 2,000 Romanians marched to the Soviet Embassy in
Bucharest, shouting ``We want Bessarabia back!'' Bessarabia is
another name for Moldavia.
   About 4,000 Romanians in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu, some
160 miles north of Bucharest, voiced similar demands.
   Soviet soldiers moved into Moldavia 50 years ago under the pact
by which Stalin and Hitler divided Eastern Europe into spheres of
influence before the two dictators became World War II adversaries.
   ``We are not giving up our national rebirth, our language,
alphabet, symbols, and so on,'' Snegur told lawmakers. ``Simply, we
must go back and look for where, maybe, we have gone too fast for
our fellow citizens.''
   Snegur's speech set off heated debate.
   ``If we want to be taken seriously as a legislature, we cannot
reconsider laws which we have already passed,'' said legislator Ion
Vatamanu.
   Nicolae Kostin, a leader of Moldavian People's Front, said he
feared the unrest could be used as a pretext by ``dark forces of
conservtives'' in Moscow to crush Moldavia's autonomy.
   More than 1,000 students marched to the republic's Parliament on
Saturday to support the Moldavian government after a clash in
Dubossary, in the eastern Dniester region, left at least three
people dead and nine wounded.
   The clash began after Russians and Ukrainians seized government
buildings in Dubossary and blocked nearby roads and a bridge over
the Dniester River.
   ``They are already martyrs,'' said Vladimir Solonar, a member of
a group of Russians opposed to Moldavia's autonomy drive, speaking
by telephone from Tiraspol in the Dniester region.
   He said black flags hung in the streets of Tiraspol, a city of
just under 200,000 people, and solemn music played on the radio. A
funeral rally was planned for Tuesday.
   About 200,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians live in the region,
which separatists on Sept. 2 declared the ``Dniester republic.''
   ``I appeal again to parents and wives to restrain all hot-headed
behavior. We must be calm and soberly keep in mind what is
happening and what could happen if we make one more misstep,'' he
said, without elaborating.
   Lawmakers said they feared the introduction of Soviet troops.
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov warned on Soviet TV Saturday night
that Moscow would take tough measures if Moldavia's leaders failed
to restore order. He did not specify what measures.
   Ion Hadyrka, Moldavia's first vice president, said Gorbachev and
Ryzhkov urged that Moldavia's leadership be altered to reflect the
percentages of ethnic groups. Hadyrka also told the legislature it
should consider giving citizens seven to 10 years to learn
Moldavian, which is spoken by two-thirds of the republic's people.

   The teachings of a Japanese coach helped Douglas
Wakiihuri of Kenya win this year's hot and humid New York City
Marathon.
   Wakiihuri went to Japan eight years ago to train under Kiyoshi
Nakamura, who had worked with the outstanding Japanese marathoner
Toshihiko Seko.
   ``He told me the way is very long,'' Wakiihuri said. ``If you
are not careful, you will hit a stone. You have to have patience.''
   The 27-year-old runner showed extreme patience Sunday. He stayed
with the lead pack for the first 20 miles before breaking away and
racing to a 40-second victory in 2 hours, 12 minutes, 39 seconds in
the 26.2-mile race.
   With the temperature reaching 72 and the humidity 66 percent at
the start of the race, it was the slowest winning time since 1984.
   Wanda Panfil of Poland beat Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., by five
seconds in 2:30:45 for the closest women's finish ever.
   The New York marathon, with a field of more than 25,000 runners,
is the nation's biggest race and the second largest in the world
after the London marathon.
   The course winds through New York's five boroughs, and parts of
it are carpeted for the occasion to protect runners' feet from
metal grates.

   Flurries fell in Montana early today, and up to 10 inches of
snow were expected across the northern mountains of Utah.
   Snow was also predicted for the higher elevations of Idaho and
Colorado. Showers were forecast for the northern Plains.
   The storm system that piled more than a foot of snow on the
Colorado Rockies this weekend and also brought the season's first
snow to Texas and Oklahoma was expected to move northeast across
the Mississippi Valley today. Showers were predicted for that
region, but colder air was expected to turn the rain to snow by the
time the system reached the Great Lakes. Up to eight inches were
possible for northern Michigan.
   Sunny, mild weather was expected to continue in the East, with
highs in the 60s and 70s. Skies were also expected to be clear on
the West Coast.
   Highs were expected to reach the 30s in regions looking for
snow, the 40s in the Pacific Northwest and northern New England,
the 50s in the Great Plains, the 70s in the Deep South and
California and the 80s in Florida and Texas.
   The high temperature for the nation Sunday was 88 degrees at
Tampa, Fla.

<HEAD>Baltimore, Hawaii Real Estate Mogul Harry Weinberg Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry Weinberg, a reclusive millionaire who made
a fortune in Baltimore and Hawaii, has died at age 82, leaving a
$900 million charitable trust, one of the biggest in the country.
   Weinberg died Sunday at the Queen's Medical Center, after an
eight-year battle with bone cancer.
   He earned millions in real estate, municipal transit companies
and other ventures in a familiar American success story.
   Last month, Forbes magazine estimated Weinberg's worth at $950
million, ranking him 70th on its list of the 400 richest Americans.
   His family immigrated to Baltimore in 1912 from what was the
Austro-Hungarian empire. Weinberg quit school at 12, worked in his
father's auto shop, sold newspapers on the side and eventually
parlayed a series of remarkably successful business deals into
enormous wealth.
   He began acquiring land during the Depression, buying 47
properties in downtown Baltimore alone.
   A millionaire by the end of World War II, Weinberg began buying
money-losing private transit companies in Baltimore, Scranton, Pa.,
Dallas, New York and Honolulu. He later sold them at enormous
profit.
   After visiting Honolulu in the early 1950s, he recognized that
jet travel would make Hawaii's tropical islands accessible to
middle-class tourists.
   He acquired Oahu and Maui properties that form the bulk of the
estate and are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars in one of
the nation's hottest real estate markets.
   Weinberg moved from Baltimore to Honolulu in 1968, but had
already set up a Baltimore-based foundation for the poor that bears
his name and that of his wife, who died in 1989.
   The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation - which will receive
most of his estate - will be among the nation's 12 largest, worth
at least $900 million and obligated to spend as much as $45 million
a year, said Shale D. Stiller, attorney for the foundation.
   ``It really is an unbelievable task,'' said Stiller. ``It's an
incredible amount of money to give away.''
   Weinberg left nothing to his son, Morton, said Stiller.
   By all accounts, Harry Weinberg was a man with little interest
in anything but business. Although he accumulated enormous wealth,
he never bothered with the trappings. His offices were drab, his
car was 10 or 15 years old, his clothes came off the rack and he
hated publicity.
   ``He didn't play golf. He didn't play tennis,'' said Morton
Weinberg, who lives near Los Angeles. ``His business was his life.
He didn't waste his time doing other things.''
   Criticized as a callous landlord who neglected his properties,
Weinberg revealed a softer side after learning he had cancer. He
announced he would give all his money away and developed a special
concern for the elderly.
   On his final 1989 pilgrimage to Israel, a nation whose birth he
witnessed in 1948, he asked to visit several of Tel Aviv's nursing
homes.
   It was a humid summer day. Weinberg, surprised the nursing homes
did not have air conditioning, wrote a check for $1 million to pay
to cool every nursing home in Israel.
   Before his death, he stipulated that the foundation give at
least 25 percent of its yearly donations to predominately Jewish
charities.
   Besides his son, Weinberg is survived by three brothers, one
sister and four grandchildren.

<HEAD>Woman Plans Christmas Visit to Brother Held Hostage in Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose twin brother is being held
hostage in Iraq said she'll overlook the dangers and spend
Christmas in Baghdad.
   ``If this helps John's morale, so be it,'' Mary Trundy, 44, of
Brockton said of her twin, John Stevenson.
   The U.S. government has urged families of captives in Iraq and
Kuwait to ignore Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's offer to let them
visit over Christmas. The White House fears the families could
become hostages, too.
   Trundy said Stevenson called their brothers in Florida over the
weekend.
   ``I think it is a very positive sign that they are letting
hostages call home,'' she said. ``We're all planning to spend the
holidays with John.''
   Trundy said her twin felt forgotten and wondered what the
government was doing to free the hostages. He asked his siblings to
bring food and a shortwave radio, saying he had not received any of
the mail they sent them, she said.
   Stevenson, who escaped Iran just 12 hours before the revolution
11 years ago, was working as a systems development manager for the
Bank of Kuwait when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   He hid until Oct. 20, when he and eight other American and
British nationals were captured and taken to Baghdad, where
hundreds of Americans are captives.

   Six young men faced arraignment today on charges
of attacking homeless men with baseball bats, pipes and meat
cleavers in a Halloween rampage that left one man dead and nine
injured.
   Five of the defendants, three of them teen-agers, were arrested
Sunday on murder charges in the death of Carlos Melendez, whose
throat was slashed. The sixth was charged with attempted murder,
police said.
   More arrests are expected, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann.
   About a dozen youths, some wearing Halloween masks, screamed,
``Trick or treat!'' as they set upon men heading to a homeless
shelter on Ward's Island in the East River.
   Police said the gang - armed with bats, pipes, knives and meat
cleavers - waited in the dark, then beat and robbed the victims as
they crossed a narrow footbridge over the river.
   ``It was Halloween, the homeless are there, they're an easy
target,'' said Capt. Daniel McKenna.
   Melendez, 35, died at the scene. Three other men required 30 to
55 stitches to close head cuts, and six others were less seriously
hurt.
   Charged with murder were Robert Sherman, 23; Hector Torres, 15;
Aaron Ware, 13, and his brother Raymond Fenner, 22; and John
Moreno, 16, police said.
   An 18-year-old, Eric Williams, was charged with attempted murder
in the attack on Roosevelt Jones, who was beaten in the face with a
pipe, police said.

<HEAD>Curfews in Gaza After 185 Wounded In Weekend Violence</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads thruout to UPDATE with more Palestinians wounded today,

   Military curfews confined 150,000 Palestinians
to their homes in the occupied Gaza Strip today following two days
of rioting in which at least 185 Palestinians were wounded by army
gunfire.
   An additional 350 Gaza residents were treated for lesser
injuries from rubber bullets, beatings and tear-gas inhalation,
according to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which oversees
Palestinian aid programs.
   The weekend clashes came as Israel rejected a call by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for international
protection of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Perez de Cuellar suggested a meeting of representatives from the
164 countries that signed the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949,
which sets out rules for the treatment of civilians in wartime.
   ``Israel is disappointed at the one-sided approach exhibited in
the report,'' Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ``The
recommendations in the report are directed only toward Israel and
do not see fit to call for a cessation of violence on the
Palestinian side.''
   Israel earlier rejected resolutions passed unanimously by the
U.N. Security Council for a U.N. probe into the Oct. 8 rioting on
Jerusalem's Temple Mount, in which 20 Palestinians were killed.
   The army spokesman's office said eight areas in Gaza were under
curfew today, including the village of Beit Hanoun, where clashes
began Saturday and spread throughout Gaza.
   Reporters and photographers without military escort were barred
from the seaside strip, where more than 700,000 Palestinians live.
   Associated Press photographer Max Nash, who went into the strip
with the army, said Palestinians persisted in stoning army jeeps
and journalists' cars in Gaza City despite increased military
patrols.
   Five Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers
today in Rafah, on the Egyptian border, according to Arab hospital
officials.
   The weekend confrontations were caused by word that a man from
Beit Hanoun died in military custody. The army said the man hanged
himself, but Palestinians questioned whether he was beaten while
being interrogated.
   An AP survey of Gaza hospitals showed 185 Palestinians treated
for gunshot wounds Saturday and Sunday.
   Officials with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency also counted at
least 150 Palestinians treated at U.N. clinics for injuries from
rubber-coated metal pellets, 70 for beatings and 130 for tear-gas
inhalation.
   An army spokesman said military figures indicated 174
Palestinians were wounded over the weekend. The spokesman, who
cannot be identified by name under briefing rules, said most
suffered light wounds.
   Today, the army demolished two more homes in Gaza's Bureij
refugee camp, raising the total in the past six weeks to 10, the
army said. The two houses were home to 20 people, Arab reports
said.
   The houses along with 30 shops were ordered destroyed after an
Israeli soldier was stoned to death and his body burned when he
accidentally drove his car into the camp on Sept. 20.
   The soldier apparently realized his mistake in entering the
camp, and injured two youngsters when he hit a cart trying to speed
out of El Bureij.
   At least one resident in each of the houses is suspected of
involvement in the soldier's death.
   The army has destroyed more than 330 Palestinian houses during
the nearly 35-month uprising against occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   At least 771 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians since the uprising began in December 1987. An
additional 294 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaboration with Israeli authorities. Fifty-one
Israelis have died in the violence.

   An explosion of a boiler's steam line at
the Aldrich Chemical Co. killed two men early today, officials
said.
   The blast at about 12:45 a.m. damaged one of several buildings
at the plant in the town of Wilson, about 25 miles north of
Milwaukee, said Capt. Steve Dortman of the Sheboygan County
Sheriff's Department.
   ``It didn't involve any chemicals, which were located
elsewhere,'' he said.
   A 37-year-old man was pronounced dead after being taken to St.
Nicholas Hospital at Sheboygan, Dortman said. A 25-year-old man
injured in the explosion died several hours later at Memorial
Medical Center in Sheboygan, the captain said.
   The names of the victims were not immediately released, pending
notification of relatives.
   Dortman said the two were maintenance workers and had been
investigating a problem with the boiler. There were no other
injuries, Dortman said.

<TEXT>
   Fighting reportedly broke out in Rwanda
again after the government said it had driven back rebel forces
that invaded from Uganda.
   Meanwhile, a French Cabinet minister was scheduled to embark
Tuesday on a mission to revive a peace initiative in Rwanda.
   French officials said Cooperation Minister Jacques Pelletier
would confer with several African heads of state, including
Rwanda's President Juvenal Habyarimana and President Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda.
   France has deployed 300 paratroopers in Rwanda to protect French
civilians and diplomats and the airport in the event an evacuation
was ordered. Several hundred French nationals already have left the
central African country.
   State-run Rwanda radio said government troops blocked a rebel
advance Sunday after the insurgents penetrated three miles into
Rwanda from the Gatuna and Kaniga border posts.
   Uganda's official New Vision newspaper said the rebels captured
the border posts after heavy fighting Saturday in which 35
government soldiers were killed and eight others were captured.
   New Vision also reported that the rebels had attacked in several
other areas in the last five days, including the southeastern town
of Rusumu on Rwanda's border with Tanzania and Burundi.
   The government on Thursday said it had retaken five towns in the
country's northeast and driven the rebels back into Uganda. But
rebel officer Lodviko Twahirwa told the newspaper other insurgents
had hidden ``deep inside'' Rwanda.
   The rebels, many of whom deserted Uganda's army to join the
invasion when it began last month, accuse Rwanda's government of
corruption and say they want to replace it with a democracy in
which all ethnic groups could participate.
   The rebel forces are drawn mainly from the hundreds of thousands
of Tutsis who fled Rwanda in the late 1950s and early 1960s. At
that time, the majority Hutu gained control in a bloody power
struggle in which more than 10,000 Tutsi were killed. About 250,000
Rwandan refugees live in Uganda.

   No one could crow better than Mary Martin.
   Sure there were other Peter Pans - Sandy Duncan, for example,
and even gymnast Cathy Rigby, who opens in a revival of the musical
on Broadway next month.
   But Martin's cock-a-doodle was special. It started in the back
of her throat, built slowly, almost impishly, and then roared out
at the audience.
   Martin would crow anywhere. Tony Award shows. Banquets. High
school auditoriums. Television talk shows. The middle of a busy
Manhattan street. Even newspaper interviews. Just ask, and she
obliged.
   That's why audiences liked her. She was down-to-earth. Texas
friendly. Martin would dazzle them with her sweet, pure singing
voice and make them laugh with her tomboyish charm and sense of
fun.
   There are more wonderful photographic memories of Martin than
any other Broadway star. Conjure up the following: Martin sitting
on a trunk, innocently singing ``My Heart Belongs to Daddy'' in
``Leave It to Me'' or draped over a chair in ``One Touch of
Venus,'' doing a sexy, witty rendition of ``That's Him'' or washing
her hair on stage in ``South Pacific'' or flying high in ``Peter
Pan'' or holding a guitar and singing to all those little children
in ``The Sound of Music.'' The memories don't stop.
   And she never seemed to grow old. Her television taping of
``Peter Pan,'' the one preserved forever on videotape, was done in
1960 when she was 47. You'd never know it. The woman seemed
eternally youthful.
   Theater critics loved Martin as much as theatergoers did. They
would fall over their adjectives trying to find new ways to write
Valentines to her.
   Harold Clurman, reviewing ``South Pacific,'' burbled ``When Mary
Martin tells us, with radiant good nature, `I'm in love, I'm in
love, I'm in love with a wonderful guy,' one doesn't murmur `Who
cares?' but `Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations to
you both!'''
   Even if the critics didn't like the show she was in, most of
their notices were unabashed love letters. Wrote Walter Kerr in the
New York Herald Tribune after Martin opened in ``Jennie,'' a
somber, unhappy musical, ``Imagine having Mary Martin play an
entire show with the corners of her mouth down! It's like using the
moon not to make love by. ... Miss Martin forever, but not as
Jennie.''
   Martin was a Broadway star, one of the few performers whose name
meant something special in the theater. She never much liked her
movies or making them. Too impersonal.
   ``No time to think. It's shoot. Boom. If you don't get it right
the first time do it again,'' she said of her Hollywood days.
   Ironically, it was television that cemented her theater career,
making her even bigger box office on Broadway. Besides ``Peter
Pan,'' she starred in a series of classy television specials -
among them, a 1953 50th anniversary salute to the Ford Motor Co.,
that co-starred Ethel Merman; a 90-minute program with Noel Coward
called ``Together with Music,'' and a television version of ``Annie
Get Your Gun,'' co-starring John Raitt. These programs brought her
an enormous audience that would turn into her staunchest theater
supporters.
   ``I hope as I go out, I'm crowing,'' Martin once said. ``When
that time comes, I'm ready for it.''
   She may have been ready, but we weren't. Thank goodness for the
RCA original cast recording of ``Peter Pan'' and the invaluable
videotape just released on cassette last September. Those sounds
and images won't fade.

   A Shinto shrine in southern Japan was damaged by a
fire early today, and police believe the attack was part of a
terrorist campaign by leftist radicals who hope to disrupt next
week's coronation.
   Officials on the island of Okinawa said no one was in the shrine
at the time of the fire, which was quickly extinguished. There were
no injuries.
   The attack came four days after two explosions rocked a police
dormitory in Tokyo, killing one policeman and injuring six other
people.
   If radicals were involved, police say, the shrine blaze would be
the 62nd guerrilla incident this year and the 10th since Oct. 1,
compared with only 27 incidents in all of 1989.
   Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, is closely associated with
the monarchy, and leftists view the emperor as a symbol of Japan's
militarist past.
   Many critics contend that the Nov. 12 government-sponsored
coronation ceremony, which has strong religious underpinnings, is a
violation of the constitutional separation of church and state.
   The attacks by radicals have heightened fears that police
efforts to guard the coronation may not be enough to keep radicals
from causing trouble, a possibility officials grudgingly
acknowledge.
   Police in Tokyo are mounting their largest security operation
ever, with 26,000 officers - more than half the Tokyo Metropolitan
Police Department - already deployed on coronation-related
assignments.
   At least another 6,000 reinforcements will be brought in from
other police forces over the next week, bringing the total to
32,000 by coronation day.
   ``If they were to attempt an attack on the palace, we could stop
them,'' a high-ranking police official recently told reporters.
``But when they disguise themselves as regular citizens, they are
very hard to uncover.''
   Police today raided several buildings used by Japan's two
largest radical groups, the 5,000-member Chukakuha, or Middle Core
Faction, and the Kakurokyo, or Revolutionary Worker's Association.
No arrests were reported.
   About 70 officers, many clad in full riot gear, forced their way
into the Kakurokyo's Tokyo headquarters. A radical who was in the
building said the raid lasted about two hours.
   News reports said police believe a faction within the Kakurokyo,
which has about 800 members, is responsible for Thursday's
dormitory blasts.
   Police would make no official comment on those reports. They
said today's raid was part of an investigation into a separate
incident last month.

   Thousands of combat troops from the reserves
will be called up to join U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, The New
York Times said today.
   More than 34,000 reservists have already been mobilized to
perform support roles.
   The reservists, who could be in the Gulf early next year, will
be among as many as 100,000 additional troops the Pentagon says it
will send to the region in coming weeks, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified Pentagon officials.
   The decision will be a major test of the use of active-duty
soldiers alongside part-time combat forces.
   The Pentagon had earlier opposed calling up combat reservists on
grounds the time needed to train them would cut into the 180-day
limit they can now serve.
   Congress, in its waning hours last week, opened the way for a
wider call-up when it doubled the limit on active-duty service for
combat reservists to 360 days.
   The reservists serving in the Gulf include doctors, cargo plane
pilots and water purification specialists.
   Army officials said combat reservists will train at Fort Irwin,
Calif., where they will practice desert warfare techniques,
according to the Times.

   A Jewish cemetery in Slovakia was
desecrated and tombstones painted with swastikas, a Prague
newspaper reported today.
   The cemetery in Nitra - about 40 miles northeast of the Slovak
capital, Bratislava - was vandalized on Friday, the independent
daily newspaper Lidove Noviny said. It said police had not made any
arrests.
   About 12,000 Jews live in Czechoslovakia, mostly in the Czech
lands, but exact statistics are not available. Before the World War
II, there were about 315,000 Jews living on Czechoslovak territory.
   Prague traditionally was one of Central Europe's most important
cultural centers of Jewry.
   Following the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe,
there has been an upsurge in anti-Semitism and racism directed at
other groups.
   In Czechoslovakia, the main targets have been gypsies and guest
workers from Cuba and Vietnam who were brought to the country by
the former Communist government.
   Skinhead youths have fought with gypsies in several cities and
towns. Vietnamese workers have been sent home en masse after
violent clashes with workers at factories in Slovakia.
   Slovak nationalists are pushing for more autonomy, or even full
independence for Slovakia, the country's smaller, more rural
republic. It is home to about one third of the country's 15.5
million people.
   A commemorative plaque to former Slovak President Jozef Tiso,
unveiled July in the central Slovak town of Banovce nad Bebravou,
was removed after a series of protests in Czechoslovak media.
   Tiso served as the president of a Nazi puppet government from
1939 to 1945 in Slovakia. About 58,000 Jews from Slovakia were
deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp under Tiso's rule.

   Illustrating the ill will against incumbents
nationwide, voters in Colorado and California appear ready to limit
how long politicians can hold office.
   ``The mood is real simple: Folks are really ticked or fed up
with how legislative bodies are conducting themselves,'' said Los
Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, a chief proponent of one
of two term-limiting ballot measures in California. Recent polls
predict approval for both.
   Elsewhere, voters in Kansas City, Mo., decide on Election Day
whether to limit City Council members to two four-year terms. If
approved, nine of 13 members would be forced out in April. Recent
polls indicate voters favor the measure 3-to-1.
   Oklahoma voters recently approved a first-in-the-nation
constitutional amendment limiting state lawmakers to 12 years in
office. The amendment takes effect Jan. 1.
   A measure that proposed a state ethics commission to regulate
lobbyists was ruled off Missouri's ballot by the state Supreme
Court on Oct. 22.
   The rush by disgruntled voters this Election Day to limit terms
is unprecedented, said Karl Kurtz, director of state services for
National Conference of State Legislatures.
   Colorado's proposed amendment would impose eight-year limits on
the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, treasurer,
attorney general and state legislators.
   It would also hold each U.S. senator and representative from
Colorado to 12 years in office, although some question the
constitutionality of state-imposed limits on federal office. The
U.S. Constitution imposes no limits on how long lawmakers may
serve.
   A survey conducted Nov. 3 for The Denver Post and KCNC-TV showed
65 percent of those polled favored the proposal, 26 percent were
opposed and 9 percent were undecided.
   In California, a survey Oct. 21-27 found 69 percent of those
polled favored Proposition 140, the stricter of two similar
measures in the state.
   That proposition would limit members of the Assembly to six
years, or three terms. State senators and other politicians holding
statewide office would be held to a total of two terms, or eight
years. The measure would also cut the Legislature's staff by about
40 percent and eliminate legislators' retirement benefits.
   Proposition 131 would limit members of the Senate and Assembly
to 12 consecutive years, or three terms in the Senate and six in
the Assembly. Other statewide offices would be held to eight
consecutive years or two terms.
   However, Proposition 131 would allow a legislator to serve 12
years, sit out a term and return for another dozen years.
   Proposition 131 is backed by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and
the citizen lobby Common Cause.
   Most California legislators bitterly oppose both measures.
   If both are approved, the one with the most votes will prevail,
according to a California Supreme Court ruling last week on a
similar matter.
   The trend toward limiting terms illustrates voters' frustration
with inaction on the budget, increasing taxes, dwindling government
services and dishonest politicans, said Jim Monaghan, a Denver
political consultant.
   ``One of the most disturbing things in politics is that it is
one of a few professions where people aren't expected to tell the
truth and get away with it,'' he said.
   Herrick Roth, a former Colorado state senator, said the argument
for reform is simple: ``Incumbency in state legislative and
executive offices is wrapped in its own security blanket, and for
the Congress it is ditto in spades.''
   However, Steve Bieringer, director of the AFL-CIO's Region XI,
based in Denver, said prolonged incumbency is not a problem in
Colorado.
   The state's congressional delegation has spent an average of
eight years in office, he said.
   One senator is retiring and a representative resigned his seat
to seek the Senate post, so the average will fall to five years
after the election, ``hardly long enough that such a drastic
measure is required,'' Bieringer said.

   Furniture maker Vernon L. Mefford is
offering a real deal, and he's talking about more than just 10

   He's offering a $1,000 reward to anyone who helps him meet and
marry his ideal woman.
   ``I'm trying a different way to meet the right person of my

been very successful for me. I've just found it to be a painful and
empty experience.''
   Mefford, 44, has been wed twice before and has two grown sons
from his first marriage. He said personal problems ended those
marriages, but they didn't sour him to the idea of trying again.
   He has printed fliers describing the kind of woman he's looking
for: a slender woman in her late 20s to early 40s with a beautiful
smile and Christian values who is intelligent, honest and willing
to reciprocate his love.
   On the other side of the flier is a price sheet for his
handcrafted swings, rockers and end tables.
   ``I just hand it out to my customers, and when I go to trade
shows I distribute the letter to everyone who comes by my booth,''
he said.
   Mefford figures he has made contact with about ``25 to 30 women
so far.''
   One of those is Robin Beck of Nashville, Ind. She called nnd
they had a dinner date.
   ``I don't think we will get married, but I think I have made a
good friend with him,'' Beck says.

<HEAD>Two-Hour Warning Strike Hits Coal Mines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miners staged a two-hour warning strike at
virtually all Poland's deep coal mines today to demand pay
increases and protest the effects of economic reform on the crucial
industry.
   The strike, called by the Solidarity miners union, affected some
70 hard coal mines. Only four of the country's mines were not
involved but workers at those expressed sympathy for the job
action, the official PAP news agency said.
   The protest was called after months of negotiations between the
Solidarity-led government and the miners' unions produced no
agreement on pay raises, Industry Ministry spokesman Jan Golab
said.
   The Council of Ministers, led by Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, was to discuss the protest in the state-owned mining
industry today, Golab said.
   But he said the demand for pay twice the national average
``cannot be met for economic reasons'' by the impoverished
government treasury. Workers nationwide earn an average $126
monthly, but miners earn $179, Golab said.
   The miners say their economic situation is worsening and that
they were promised higher salaries during the 1989 negotiations
between the then-Communist authorities and Solidarity-led
opposition.
   The growing unrest in the traditionally volatile industry comes
three weeks before Poland's first popular presidential election.
   Mazowiecki faces Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa in a contest
focused on the government's economic reforms.
   Coal is a crucial export for Poland and the main domestic energy
source. The mines, mostly in the Silesia region of southwestern
Poland, were heavily subsidized by the government under the
socialized system and miners received many fringe benefits,
including shops for goods in short supply.
   Post-Communist Poland is stripping away subsidies, forcing state
industries to become self-sufficient as the country switches to a
market-driven capitalist economy.
   But the mining industry is so economically unsound because of
inefficiency, decades of artificially low, government-set prices
for coal and other factors that high levels of support from the
national treasury continue to be required.

   Police said today they had arrested a Soviet KGB
major as part of an ongoing drive to round up Soviet spies in what
was once East Germany.
   The now-dissolved East German state served as a major base for
Soviet espionage efforts. The two Germanys merged on Oct. 3.
   Berlin police, in a statement, identified the arrested Soviet
man only as Sergei P., and said he was 34.
   He was arrested over the weekend while meeting with a German
contact in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, they said. Many Soviet
soldiers are stationed in Potsdam.
   The German contact, identified only as Rainer K., had tipped off
police, they said. Police have been urging German citizens to
confess entanglements in intelligence activities and turn in their
contacts.
   Police and Germany's federal intelligence service are trying to
shut down old spy networks and prevent spies who once worked for
East Germany's formidable Stasi secret police from going over to
the Soviets.

   Leaders of Christian churches
opposed to apartheid and those that long supported segregation met
today in an effort to reach consensus on ending discrimination and
building a new South Africa.
   ``For the first time there is the distinct possibility that the
Christian churches can speak with one voice on apartheid and the
country's future,'' the Rev. Frank Chikane, co-chairman of the
conference, told the Sunday Times.
   He said Christian churches represent 78 percent of the
population.
   The National Conference of Churches, billed as the largest such
gathering ever in South Africa, has attracted about 300 delegates
from 90 churches to Rustenburg, 60 miles northwest of Johannesburg.
   Virtually all the country's leading Christian clergymen were to
attend the conference, which began today, including Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984
for his anti-apartheid activism.
   The delegates will seek to reach agreement by the end of the
conference Friday on what churches should do to help South Africa
make a peaceful transition from apartheid to a non-discriminatory
democracy.
   Many of the churches represented belong to the South African
Council of Churches, often at the forefront of the anti-apartheid
movement. Chikane is general secretary of the council.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church, which argued for
decades apartheid was supported by the Bible, also was present. It
is the main church of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners who dominate
the government.
   The Dutch Reformed Church now says that apartheid is wrong and
has no biblical foundation. But virtually all Dutch Reformed
Churches remain segregated. The church says it wants to merge with
its black and mixed-race sister churches but no action is expected
for several years.
   The black and mixed-race branches have staunchly opposed
apartheid.
   Two relatively small white churches that still support apartheid
declined to attend the conference. They were the Reformed Church
and the Afrikaans Protestant Church, which broke from the Dutch
Reformed Church in 1988 to protest moves away from apartheid.
   South Africa is predominantly Christian, with large numbers of
Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists, Zionists and Pentecostalists.
There are also many Jews and Moslems in South Africa.
   Last Christmas, President F.W. de Klerk called on the country's
churches to develop a joint position on the role they envisioned
playing in the country's future.
   De Klerk has promised to dismantle the apartheid system and
negotiate a new constitution that would allow the country's 5
million whites and 30 million blacks to share power.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who
has been under house arrest since July 1989, has won a Norwegian
award for defending human rights in Burma.
   Ms. Suu Kyi was named winner of the annual Thorolf Rafto
Memorial Prize for Human Rights, said a statement on Sunday from
the Rafto Foundation based in Bergen, Norway.
   ``Aung San Suu Kyi personifies Burma's mass movement for
democracy,'' the statement said. ``Through her courageous and
devoted work for human rights and democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi has
become the focal point of the Burmese opposition demanding an end
to the iron-fisted military rule in the country.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi, 45, is the daughter of the late Burmese
independence leader Aung San. She is a leader of the National
League for Democracy, which easily won elections in May. The
military government has refused to yield power.
   The award statement said that under Burma's military rulers,
``massacres, extrajudicial executions, detention, torture and
harassment has befallen thousands and thousands of peaceful
civilians.''
   Amnesty International and several Western governments and groups
have made similar charges against the government, which came to
power in September 1988 in a crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement that left thousands dead.
   An independent expert sent by the U.N. Commission On Human
Rights, Sadako Ogata of Japan, arrived in Rangoon on Saturday and
is expected to seek a meeting with Ms. Suu Kyi.
   Political sources reached in Rangoon by telephone from Bangkok
said the authorities were unlikely to allow the meeting.
   The military leader, Gen. Saw Maung, said on state radio Friday:
   ``What type of rights do they want? I am not the one to be
investigated ... I tell you, if anyone wants to enjoy the human
rights they have in the U.S., in England and India, provided that
country accepts, I will permit them to leave.''
   Saw Maung's latest crackdown has been against the Buddhist
clergy who had protested alleged killings by soldiers in early
August.
   On Wednesday, he banned unauthorized monks' groups and
threatened dissident offenders with up to three years in prison.
   On Oct. 22, soldiers began raiding monasteries in the central
city of Mandalay and arrested dozens of monks.
   Thorolf Rafto was a Norwegian professor and human rights
advocate who died in 1986. Last year the Rafto prize was awarded
jointly to the Hungarian youth opposition movement, FIDESZ, and to
Romanian dissident Doina Cornea, who was kept under house arrest by
President Nicolae Ceausescu for several years.
   The Rafto award carries a $4,200 prize.

<TEXT>
   About 90 American Red Cross workers in
West Virginia went on strike today in a contract dispute, but the
agency said its services wouldn't be affected.
   Members of the National Union of Hospital and Health Care
Workers District 1199 went on strike at Red Cross officers in
Beckley, Charleston, Huntington and Parkersburg, union spokesman
David Mott said.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Evelyn Spencer said the Red Cross had a
7-to 10-day blood supply and would conduct normal business.
   ``We will have to depend on volunteers and professionals, but I
have every hope that things will be resolved,'' Spencer said. ``I
hope it will be a normal Monday.''
   Mott said Red Cross workers average less than $5 per hour and
``are consistently paid $2 less per hour than comparable health
care employees in this area.''
   He said the company wants to take away some holidays, personal
days and vacations.
   ``This is a multimillion-dollar corporation. They have people
like Elizabeth Dole making $185,000 a year. Yet they are demanding
concessions from workers,'' Mott said. Mrs. Dole resigned as
secretary of labor last month to become president of the American
Red Cross.
   Spencer said management is not asking for concessions but wants
more control over sick days.
   ``Workers earn 12 sick days a year. By contro, we mean we need
to have six of those days verified,'' she said. ``You call in sick.
I say, `fine, you've had your six free days, now you have to have
them verified by a doctor.'''

<HEAD>New Powers for Sharon Draw Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government faced angry protests today over
its decision to grant sweeping powers to Israeli immigration chief
Ariel Sharon, who must provide housing for at least 1 million
Soviets in the next two years.
   The government, meanwhile, said the pace of immigration was
increasing, with 75,000 Soviets expected in the next two months.
About 120,000 Soviets have arrived so far this year.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Cabinet voted Sunday
to give Sharon a free hand in earmarking state lands as
construction sites and awarding jobs to contractors.
   The center-left Labor Party and six other opposition factions
responded by announcing motions of no confidence in the Cabinet to
be submitted today in Parliament, said Sarah Yitzhaki, the
parliamentary spokeswoman.
   Much of the anger results from Sharon's reputation as a maverick
who ignores the rules to get things done. As defense minister in
1982, he failed to inform the Cabinet of his plans for an invasion
deep into Lebanon, involving Israel in its most divisive war.
   Now he heads a special ministerial committee with responsibility
for housing the wave of Soviet immigration, which is expected to
total 1 million new arrivals before the end of 1992.
   Today, Sharon defended the Cabinet decision, which came by an
11-4 vote. He said he needed the new powers to speed up
construction.
   ``We are in a true emergency, and we need to shorten the
bureaucratic process,'' he said on Israel radio.
   He also accused his opponents of being unpatriotic. ``Those, who
act out of narrow partisan motives at a time when the Israeli
people have to deal with a great mission, do exactly the opposite
of what we have to do,'' said Sharon.
   But some government officials and opposition leaders said the
Cabinet decision could lead to widespread corruption.
   Among the opponents were Justice Minister Dan Meridor, a Shamir
confidant, and Attorney General Yosef Harish.
   Some government lawyers argued Sharon's widespread powers could
hold up building because contractors who felt wronged would appeal
to the courts. Opposition leaders said they feared the decision
would enrich contractors with Likud ties.
   ``With our own hands, we are opening the door to corruption,''
Shimon Shetreet, a Labor legislator, said on Israel radio. ``Even
in a time of emergency, let us not develop a feeling that
everything is permissible.''
   The government was expected to survive today's confidence vote.
But its fate could depended on the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel
Party, which has five members in the 120-seat Parliament.
   The party has been negotiating for several months to join the
government, but also told Labor leader Shimon Peres earlier this
week it would consider voting to topple the Likud-led government.

breach of trust, conspiracy, possession of property obtained by

   Noseworthy was one of five people charged following a nine-month

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Appeal of Texas Woman in Parental Rights
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear the
appeal of a Texas woman who says she lost parental rights over her
young daughter because the free legal help she got was inadequate.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, turned down a request to
use the case to decide whether poor people may challenge the
competency of their court-appointed lawyers when states seek to
take away their children.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case,
but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   In a series of decisions, the high court has ruled that poor
criminal defendants facing serious charges have a constitutional
right to free and effective legal help.
   And in a key 1984 ruling, the court said a defendant's
conviction may be overturned if he or she can prove a
court-appointed lawyer's deficiency calls into question the
result's reliability.
   The justices in 1981 said poor people facing termination of
parental rights may have a due-process right to free legal help,
but the court never has said that such help must meet any specific
standard of effectiveness.
   Nicolosa Barnes was stripped of parental rights to her daughter,
Christina, in 1987 by the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit of the
Texas Department of Human Resources.
   Court records indicate that Christina, then 5 years old, was
suffering from malnutrition.
   Doctors said the child was frail and listless, and had bleeding
sores in her mouth. One doctor said it appeared the child had been
``starved'' for two weeks.
   Mrs. Barnes' husband, Harold, also was stripped of parental
rights to Christina. He did not appeal. The Barneses also have
three sons, according to court documents.
   In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. Barnes said her
court-appointed lawyer called no witnesses in the parental-rights
termination hearing, made no prehearing investigation and failed to
object to harmful and inadmissible evidence.
   ``When an indigent is entitled to appointment of counsel when
the permanent deprivation of one's child is at stake, that counsel
must be competent or the judgment should be set aside,'' the appeal
contended.
   The Texas Supreme Court rejected Mrs. Barnes' appeal last March.
   The case is Barnes vs. Dallas County Child Welfare Unit,
90-5156.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling on Disabled Workers in Ohio Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that barred employee benefit plans from discriminating against
workers who are disabled later in their careers.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by Ohio officials
that younger workers forced to retire because of disabilities are
entitled to greater benefits.
   The dispute between the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System
and retired speech pathologist June Betts led to a ruling by the
justices last year in favor of the state officials.
   The high court in 1989 said a state law permitting reduced
benefits for Ms. Betts did not violate a federal law banning age
bias in employment - unless she can prove intentional
discrimination ``in some non-fringe benefit aspect of the
employment relation.''
   The ruling appeared to say workers charging age bias must prove
that reduced fringe benefits were aimed, for example, at
discouraging older workers from applying for jobs or were intended
to force them to quit.
   But the 1989 decision was not the end of Ms. Betts' case.
   The high court sent it back to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to determine whether she was forced to retire, and
therefore may not be penalized with reduced benefits.
   The appeals court ruled her retirement was involuntary.
   Ms. Betts was a speech pathologist for the Hamilton County
Mental Retardation Department. When her ability to work
deteriorated because of health problems, she was given a choice by
the state in 1985 of taking unpaid medical leave or retirement with
a standard pension.
   She was barred from receiving more generous disability
retirement benefits because she was 61. A provision of the state
pension plan allows disability benefits only for those who worked
for the state for at least five years and were under 60 when forced
to quit.
   Ms. Betts' pension was $158.50 a month under the standard plan,
compared to $355 a month she would have received in disability
retirement benefits.
   The 6th Circuit court, re-examining the case after the 1989 high
court ruling, said Ms. Betts was the victim of illegal age
discrimination.
   ``She was denied the choice of disability benefits which would
have been available to her had she been one year younger,'' the
appeals court said. ``Employers may not force older workers
involuntarily into less desirable retirement programs on the basis
of age. Such coercive conduct constitutes involuntary retirement.''
   The case is Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio vs.
Betts, 90-451.

<TEXT>
   The army said today it has arrested a
suspected Communist rebel leader believed to have been involved in
planning the 1989 killing of a U.S. Army colonel.
   In another development, the government has agreed to drop civil
suits against one of the closest associates of the late President
Ferdinand Marcos in exchange for his holdings in various Philippine
companies, an official said.
   Maj. Gen. Guillermo Flores, chief of the Philippine army,
identified the arrested rebel suspect as Reynaldo Bernardo. He said
Bernardo is believed to be the intelligence chief and vice
commander of the Manila wing of the Communist New People's Army,
known as the Alex Boncayao Brigade.
   Flores said Bernardo helped plan the April 21, 1989 killing of
Col. James Rowe near his office at the Joint U.S. Military
Assistance Group in suburban Quezon City. He said as the brigade's
intelligence chief, Bernardo was ``deeply involved'' in the
selection of ssassination targets.
   A team of soldiers and policemen arrested Bernardo on Sunday in
Quezon City, Flores said. He said Bernardo was carrying ``very
sensitive documents'' and had a pistol but did not resist arrest.
   The army commander said Bernardo would be charged with illegal
possession of a firearm, and other charges would depend on results
of interrogation.
   Word that civil suits were dropped against the former Marcos
associate came today from Arthur Defensor, a member of the
Presidential Commission on Good Government.
   He said the agreement with Roberto Benedicto was signed Saturday
in Singapore. Benedicto, 73, was a classmate of Marcos and among
the late ruler's closest associates.
   Under the agreement, Benedicto gave up assets and funds totaling
about $43 million. He had previously turned over about $28 million
in deposits in foreign bank accounts.
   Under the agreement, the government will release control over
Benedicto's other assets and drop three civil suits against him. It
was not certain whether Benedicto, who now has immunity under the
settlement, will be called as a witness in 33 civil suits against
the Marcos family.
   The government says Marcos stole billions of dollars from the
national treasury during his administration.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Prosecution Of Cable Systems Carrying Playboy
Channel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let Puerto
Rico prosecute some cable TV systems for carrying The Playboy
Channel, rebuffing arguments that a lower court ruling unduly
hampered states' anti-obscenity efforts.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that such
prosecutions are pre-empted by federal law.
   In another obscenity case today, the court upheld an Illinois
law that lets authorities seize the property of businesses
convicted at least twice of obscenity violations.
   The court rejected the argument of Sequoia Books, Inc. that the
law operates as a prior restraint on free expression.
   At issue in the Puerto Rico case was the effect of the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, which imposes mandatory access
obligations on cable operators whose systems have at least 36
active channels.
   The law says such operators must make available, on a
first-come, first-served basis, a certain number of channels for
commercial use by programmers not affiliated with the cable system.
   Once an unaffiliated programmer obtains access, the cable
operator is prohibited from exercising any editorial control over
the programming transmitted on that channel.
   But the federal law also states that cable operators cannot be
held accountable for any libel, obscenity or false advertising
carried on a channel it surrendered under the mandatory access
provisions.
   In the spring of 1987, a prosecutor in Puerto Rico's Department
of Justice notified cable operators that criminal obscenity charges
would be filed against all systems transmitting The Playboy
Channel.
   Within a few months, all cable systems but one - Teleponce Inc.
- had dropped The Playboy Channel, which features so-called adult
entertainment.
   Playboy Enterprises Inc., which through a wholly owned
subsidiary distributed The Playboy Channel, and the Puerto Rico
Cable Television Association, a trade group, then sued the island
commonwealth's Department of Justice.
   The suit, invoking a federal civil rights law, accused Puerto
Rico officials of unlawfully interfering with free-speech rights.
   U.S. District Judge Jaime Pieras Jr. barred authorities from
taking any action against any cable operator carrying The Playboy
Channel under the federal Cable Act's mandatory access provisions.
   The judge said local obscenity prosecutions of such cable
operators were precluded by the federal law.
   The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that
ruling last June.
   In the appeal acted on today, Puerto Rico Secretary of Justice
Hector Rivera Cruz argued that the federal civil rights law invoked
against his department should not be used to pre-empt obscenity law
enforcement.
   He criticized the appeals court's ``omission of any reference to
(the federal law's attempt) to preserve to the states the
traditional police power in the enforcement of laws concerning any
matter that is obscene or otherwise unprotected by the
Constitution.''
   Lawyers for Playboy Enterprises urged the justices to reject the
appeal.
   They said the lower court rulings halted ``a concerted
censorship campaign ... designed to intimidate cable systems,'' and
that the civil rights law invoked in the lawsuit ``imposes no
limitation on the enforcement authority of Puerto Rico beyond that
imposed by the Cable Act itself.''
   The case is Cruz vs. Playboy Enterprises, 90-491.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-nine blacks were
fatally shot or stabbed, including several whose deaths may be
linked to a feud between high school students in a township, police
said today.
   Another eight of the deaths were believed to be the result of
clashes between rival taxi companies, police said. Those deaths
occurred when men traveling in vans randomly stabbed and shot
people Sunday in the Kutloanong township, 140 miles southwest of
Johannesburg, police said.
   Rival taxi groups began fighting one another last week in
Kutloanong, resulting in the three deaths before Sunday's violence.
Police said they were trying to determine whether Sunday's attack
was linked to the earlier killings.
   There are about 100,000 privately owned taxi-vans operating in
black areas nationwide, and violent disputes over routes and
passengers occur regularly.
   Also, the daily police unrest report said 19 people were killed
in Bekkersdal and one died in Alexandra. Both townships are outside
Johannesburg. Also, a man was stabbed to death in Mganga Baboyi, a
township in the eastern province of Natal, the unrest report added.
   Police Capt. Eugene Opperman said most of the deaths in
Bekkersdal were the result of a fued between students who wanted to
take final examinations and those demanding a boycott.
   Some students in townships have long demanded boycotts of the
year-end exams to protest school conditions in the black townships.
   Opperman said the 19 deaths had occurred since Thursday, but he
did not have a breakdown for each day. He also said it was not
known how many were the result of the school feud, but he believed
it was most of them.
   Another police official, Capt. Henriette Bester, said there were
some incidents of arson and stone-throwing Monday in Bekkersdal.
   Thousands of blacks have died in township violence since 1986,
most of it involving factional fighting between supporters of the
African National Congress and the rival Inkatha Freedom Party. They
are the country's two largest anti-apartheid groups but differ on
tactics for fighting apartheid and on their idea for a future South
Africa.

   Two nursing home residents who sneaked off
to South Carolina to be married have decided to leave the home and
live together.
   Arnold Beck, 82, and Isabelle Summit Beck, 73, were married Aug.
31 in York, S.C. It was her second marriage and his fourth.
   They honeymooned in a borrowed cottage in Bessemer City but
returned to their separate rooms at the nursing home.
   ``We don't feel too much like husband and wife because we're not
together except during the day,'' Mrs. Beck said.
   Beck moved into a single room i South Haven nursing home in
1987 with his ailing third wife. She died shortly afterward. Mrs.
Summit, who had been married 45 years to preacher Max Summit, was a
widow when she moved to South Haven in 1988.
   ``I thought she'd be the last woman I ever hooked up with,''
Beck said. ``But she threw a lasso of love around me. I didn't love
her at first. It just fell over me.''
   A lifelong gospel singer, Mrs. Summit joined with Beck one night
as he sang, ``No, Never Alone.''
   Without even silverware, they're readying to move into an
apartment by the end of November. Family members are scrambling to
help.
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' said daughter-in-law Linda Summit.
``At (their age) they know what's best for them, I suppose.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
visit Germany Friday and Saturday and sign a 20-year friendship
treaty between the two nations, the government said today.
   Dieter Vogel, spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said details
of the visit were still being worked out. But he said Gorbachev was
likely to visit Bonn and then Kohl's home in Oggersheim, 55 miles
southwest of Frankfurt.
   The agreement Gorbachev and Kohl plan to sign is one of the most
important bilateral agreements ever worked out between the two
nations. The 20-year treaty reflects the two countries' hopes of
laying to rest past enmity.
   Many Soviet citizens remain bitter over the carnage and death
brought to their land by Adolf Hitler's armies.
   In the treaty, the two nations will pledge not to use force
against each other and to respect the boundaries of all countries
in Europe. The pact also creates the framework for German financial
and technological help for the Soviet Union, and for intensified
political and cultural ties.
   The document was initialed in Moscow on Sept. 13.
   The two leaders are also expected to talk about the Persian Gulf
crisis and developments in Europe, said Vogel.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling That Property Of Obscenity Dealers Can Be
Seized</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
allowing prosecutors to punish businesses convicted of dealing in
obscenity by seizing their property.
   The court, without comment, rejected an adult bookstore's
challenge to an Illinois anti-pornography law.
   The justices recently boosted efforts to crack down on
obscenity.
   The court last year ruled in a case from Indiana that states may
use anti-racketeering laws in the drive against adult bookstores
and other businesses that sell or display sexually explicit
material.
   But the court said in that ruling that prosecutors may not use
such tough crime-fighting measures to shut down the businesses
before trials are held to determine whether any of the material
sold is obscene.
   Last month, the court left intact the forced closing by federal
officials of three adult bookstores and nine video rental shops in
Virginia. A lower court ruled that seizing their property after
they were convicted of racketeering and selling obscene material
did not violate the bookstore owners' free-speech rights.
   In the case acted on today, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld an Illinois law challenged by Sequoia Books Inc.,
owner of the Denmark II bookstore in Kendall County.
   Sequoia Books was convicted of selling obscene materials 12
times between January 1985 and September 1987.
   An Illinois law that took effect Jan. 1, 1989, lets authorities
seize property ``derived from or used to commit obscenity
offenses.'' Any business convicted at least twice of obscenity
violations is subject to forfeiting its property.
   The 7th Circuit court said the law may not be applied
retroactively but said Sequoia's property may be seized for any
obscenity violation from 1989 onward.
   The bookstore's owners said the law operates as a prior
restraint on free expression.
   Fearing an obscenity conviction that could be economically
devastating, the owners said they are forced to engage in
self-censorship and stop selling adult-oriented material that may
not be obscene.
   The 7th Circuit court rejected the argument, noting that the
Illinois law is less sweeping than the seizure provisions of the
federal anti-racketeering law that has survived similar challenges.
   A previous attempt by Illinois officials to use a public
nuisance law to shut down the Denmark II bookstore was declared
unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court.
   The state court said officials may not use public nuisance laws
to shut down establishments that sell non-obscene works merely
because some obscene material was sold there.
   Sexually explicit material, often characterized as pornography,
is not necessarily obscene. Obscenity, a legal term, must be
determined in a judicial proceeding.
   Sexually explicit material judged obscene enjoys no free-speech
protection. If the material is not found to be obscene, it is
protected by constitutional free-speech guarantees.
   The case is Sequoia Books vs. Ingemunson, 90-454.

   Tuesday's general election in Wyoming
could be canceled if a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of
the ballot is successful, the state's top election official said.
   ``Wouldn't that be interesting if there was no election on
Tuesday?'' asked Secretary of State Kathy Karpan, who is running
for re-election. ``We might have a problem.''
   Karpan initially planned to fly to Sweetwater County to attend a
court hearing on the lawsuit today, but decided instead to remain
in Cheyenne and try to arrange a telephone conference call with the
judge.
   The lawsuit was filed Friday by Elaine Watkins, chairwoman of
the Sweetwater County Democratic Party. She claims new electronic
ballots are unconstitutional because the names of Republican
candidates appear above Democratic candidates.
   The old ballots had the Republicans alongside the Democrats.
   ``What happens if the judge rules the ballot invalid?'' Karpan
wondered. ``I hope we can still go forward with an election.''
   She said today that if she got to talk to the judge she would
argue that it's too late to challenge the ballot format. The code
calls for any challenges to be made in the three days following
publication of the ballot, which occurred two weeks ago, she said.
   Twenty-two of Wyoming's 23 counties have similar new ballots
with the Republican candidates listed atop the Democratic
candidates. Crook County still uses paper ballots that list the
candidates horizontally.
   Karpan said she is confident the new ballots are constitutional.
   She argued that Wyoming law allows county clerks to modify the
format of the ballot - from horizontal to vertical in this case -
to adjust to new technology.
   In addition, she explained that Republicans are listed first
because, under state law, the party of the U.S. House
representative that won the majority of votes in that county in the
previous general election comes first.
   Republican Dick Cheney beat Democrat Bryan Sharratt in every
county in the state in 1988.
   The lawsuit asked the court for a declaratory judgment ruling
the ballot and a section of the state election code
unconstitutional.
   The lawsuit also sought preliminary and permanent injunctions
ordering the Sweetwater County clerk to refrain from using the
ballot format Tuesday.
   State Democratic Party Chairman Chuck Graves said the party is
not trying to interfere with the election or set it aside, but will
push the issue if it appears a candidate has been harmed by the
contested ballot.

<HEAD>`Buddy,' A Musical Biography of Buddy Holly, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS four grafs at end with reviews from other critics. No PMs

<TEXT>
   Buddy Holly and Broadway don't mix.
   At least not in ``Buddy,'' a comic-strip cannibalization of the
life of the rock 'n' roll legend, which opened Sunday at the
Shubert Theater.
   There are basically two different shows on stage at the Shubert
- one a dumb, dramatic biography with dialogue that would put
Archie and Jughead to shame and the other an elaborate musical
concert that makes some attempt to show why Holly was so important
to pop music in the late 1950s.
   But the man behind such classics as ``Peggy Sue,'' ``That'll Be
the Day'' and others deserves a better showcase for his material
than a glorified sound-and-light show gussied up with elaborate
posters and billboards featuring advertisements from 30 years ago.
   Perhaps the producers were afraid to let the songs stand by
themselves, although Holly's life is not the stuff of great
conflict. Writer Alan Janes is hard pressed to come up with
anything beyond a straightforward recitation of the man's short
musical career, which lasted only 18 months.
   ``Buddy'' chronicles Holly's rise from reluctant country and
western singer in Lubbock, Texas, to rock 'n' roll star to his
death at age 22. He never wanted to sing just country, a fact lost
on myopic record producers in Nashville. Only when Holly and his
band, The Crickets, hook up with manager Norman Petty, does their
career take off.
   It would be nice if the show did, too, but Act 2 opens with a
tedious episode about how Holly meets his future wife, Maria Elena,
in a recording company office.
   The acting is primitive - broad, loud and embarrassing. The
jokes are sledgehammered home with the confidence that they are
funny. They're not.
   If the performers can't act, at least most of them can sing.
That leads to the evening's one flicker of creativity - the
recreation of Holly's last concert, the one he did with the Big
Bopper and Ritchie Valens the night they were killed in a light
plane crash.
   The horn-rimmed Paul Hipp, dressed for much of the evening in
blue jeans, white socks and black penny loafers, sings well as
Holly. He even sounds a little like the man. And there are
acceptable impersonations of the Big Bopper by David Mucci and
Ritchie Valens by Philip Anthony.
   The songs do have a nostalgic appeal, pop anthems that harken
back to a simpler time when ``American Bandstand,'' not MTV, ruled
the airwaves.
   To its credit, the music for ``Buddy'' is performed live and is
not canned. There's no lip-synching and that sense of live music
can get the audience going. At one of the final preview
performances, a crowd of aging and out-of-shape baby boomers worked
themselves into hand-clapping exhaustion during the final concert
sequence. It would be wise for the Shubert to have its house
physician in the theater during all performances.
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: ``It's too bad that the
beginning of `Buddy' is not nearly so happy as the ending. ... Not
content to give its customers the 1950s equivalent to `Beatlemania'
that they came for, the creators of `Buddy' pad the evening with a
superficial, extremely talky biographical drama that makes the
puffy 1940s Hollywood biographies of Tin Pan Alley composers look
like `Citizen Kane.'''
   Howard Kissel, the Daily News: ``If `Buddy, The Buddy Holly
Story' were an audio-animatronics exhibit at Disney World, you
could praise it for being uncannily lifelike. But considering that
it appears to be written and performed by humans, I'm afraid it's
not lifelike enough. ... The depressing thing is that the audience
responds as if they were watching an actual concert, rather than an
imitation. Real, fake - it seems like an event and the crowd is so
hungry to be associated with one they go along with it.''
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: ``The premise is flimsy but, oh,
boy! the premises are jumpin' ... `Buddy' ... is little more than a
rock concert set to Broadway. But what a rock concert! ... I like
it.''

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Use California Murder Case to Set New Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use a
California murder case to set new guidelines for federal court
appeals by convicted defendants who say their rights were violated.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by state officials in
the case of Owen Duane Nunnemaker, sentenced to life in prison for
murdering his estranged wife in 1975.
   The court is expected to announce a ruling by July.
   Nunnemaker shot his wife, Alice, in her home in Sebastopol. He
testified that he did not recall the shooting and did not intend to
kill her.
   At his trial, Nunnemaker's lawyer objected to statements made by
a state psychiatrist but did not claim the psychiatrist violated
the defendant's rights by questioning him without warning him of
his right to remain silent and to have an attorney present.
   Some 10 years later, Nunnemaker began a new round of state court
appeals, arguing the psychiatrist violated his rights.
   The appeals were unsuccessful, culminating with the California
Supreme Court denying him a hearing without comment.
   Nunnemaker then turned to the federal courts for help. A federal
judge ruled that the defendant was barred now from arguing the
psychiatrist violated his rights because no such claim was made at
his trial.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judge's
ruling in May and ordered the judge to conduct further hearings.
   The appeals court said the state Supreme Court's failure to
explain why it denied Nunnemaker's appeal opens the way for further
federal court review. Such federal court appeals are called habeas
corpus petitions - post-conviction challenges by defendants who say
their rights were violated.
   Relying on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year, the 9th
Circuit court said, ``Where a state supreme court does not plainly
state in its summary denial of an original habeas petition that its
ruling rests on a state procedural bar, federal review is not
precluded.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court in 1989 revived a Chicago murderer's
challenge to his conviction. The justices in that case said the
defendant had lost a state court appeal on ambiguous grounds
because the state court did not say clearly that it was relying on
procedural grounds to foreclose any new federal court appeal.
   The California attorney general's office said the 9th Circuit
court ruling will permit ``cynical manipulation of the
post-conviction remedies provided by the state and federal
systems.'' The state lawyers said hundreds of cases each year in
California will be affected.
   The case acted on today is Ylst vs. Nunnemaker, 90-68.

<HEAD>U.S. Army Investigates Klan Posters Found at Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army is investigating the
appearance of racist posters at a military post in Frankfurt, a
spokeswoman said today.
   Frankfurt military community spokeswoman Brigitte Schmitz said
the posters appeared last month in the military's Ambassador Arms
hotel. She commented after a report on the incident appeared in the
Stars and Stripes newspaper.
   ``The investigation is still ongoing, but has not advanced very
far yet,'' Ms. Schmitz said. The spokeswoman said a $1,000 reward
had been offered for information leading to the arrest of those who
put up the posters.
   The posters invited people who are ``tired of rap music, AIDS
and being intimidated because you're white, to be a part of a group
fighting to stop such things for 120 years,'' the newspaper said.
   The posters had the Ku Klux Klan insignia and a telephone number
to call in the United States for more information. The number is no
longer in service.
   Military regulations forbid membership in extremist
organizations. The Klan is on a list of organizations off limits to
service members and dependents and U.S. civilian employees of the
military.
   Maximum sentence for violation of the regulation is a
dishonorable discharge and up to two years imprisonment, the
newspaper said.

<HEAD>Crain's: Advertisers of Strike-Bound News Heading for Radio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advertisers in the strike-bound Daily News are
turning to radio rather than other newspapers in the city, but many
of the stations are already heavily booked, a business publication
reported today.
   Crain's New York Business reported radio is drawing advertisers
who are concerned that the New York Post and New York Newsday, the
city's other two tabloids, don't provide the right mix of readers.
   
   Many radio stations, however, can't handle the extra advertisers
because their ad load has increased for the holiday season, Crain's
said.
   ``I have problems with the Post because of the editorial
content,'' said Harvey Berman, president of the Harvey Berman ad
agency. ``We would consider radio; however, last weekend I tried to
get a news radio package for a client, but couldn't get the time.''
   The 71-year-old News trudged ahead Sunday, handing out free
samples and using ``hawkers'' to sell newspapers on the street
where vendors feared union intimidation. The press run was about
600,000. News' spokeswoman Lisa Robinson said 50,000 copies were
given away.
   ``We're still seeing gaps in distribution,'' she said. ``Many,
many people support us. Some people don't.''
   The News, the nation's third-largest metropolitan daily, had a
Sunday circulation of about 1.2 million before the strike began
Oct. 25.
   Nine of the newspaper's 10 unions went on strike. Some union
members have returned to work, but about 2,000 remain off the job.
Negotiations that began in January over contracts that expired in
March have been fruitless.
   The unions charge unfair labor practices.

   Americans should eat less fat and cholesterol
and more vegetables, fruits and grains, according to new federal
dietary guidelines issued today.
   The guidelines differ little from the last set, issued in 1985,
although the new ones offer more information, including recommended
limits on the amount of fat in a healthy diet.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan acknowledged
that the guidelines were ``no earth-shattering thing,'' but he said
their specificity would make them easier for Americans to
understand and follow.
   The guidelines ``can make all the difference between good health
and illness, between long life and premature death,'' he said.
   ``Americans who ignore them do so at their own peril,'' said
Sullivan, who released the guidelines with Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter.
   Both secretaries rejected criticism from a consumer group that
the new guidelines are weaker than the 1985 set.
   The guidelines, which apply to people 2 years and older, make
seven different points:
   -Eat a variety of foods.
   -Maintain healthy weight.
   -Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol.
   -Choose a diet with plenty of vegetables, fruits and grain
products.
   -Use sugars only in moderation.
   -Use salt and sodium only in moderation.
   -If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.
   The guidelines suggest that depending on body size and activity
level, a healthy diet consists of 3-5 servings daily of vegetables;
2-4 servings of fruit; 6-11 servings from the food group that
includes breads, cereals, rice and pasta; 2-3 servings of milk,
yogurt and cheese; and 2-3 servings of meats, poultry, fish, dry
beans and peas, eggs and nuts.
   The amount of food in a serving depends on the food. For
example, for vegetables, one cup of raw leafy greens or a half cup
of other kinds constitute a serving. Other one-serving amounts
include one slice of bread; half a bun, bagle or english muffin;
one ounce of ready-to-eat cereal; a half cup of cooked cereal, rice
or pasta; one medium apple, orange or banana; one cup of milk; and
1.5 ounces of cheese.
   They also recommend that total fat provide 30 percent or less of
calories daily, and that saturated fat, which is mainly from animal
products and tropical oils, be limited to less than 10 percent of
total calories.
   The guidelines define moderation in drinking alcoholic
beverages: for women, one drink per day, and for men, no more than
two drinks a day. One drink means 12 ounces of regular beer, five
ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, 80 proof,
according to the federal document.
   In several places, they make special recommendations for
pregnant women, saying they may need additional nutrients and
should not drink alcoholic beverages.
   John R. Cady, president of the National Food Processors
Association, said the new guidelines recognize that there are no
bad foods, but rather bad diets.
   Cady said his group would use the guidelines as a basis for a
national food label education program to help consumers when new
food labels are introduced. Cady's group, which represents the
makers of most of the nation's processed and packaged food
products, is leading that effort.
   But the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit
consumer advocacy group, contended that the new guidelines are
weaker than the 1985 ones. Also, they do not heed the advice of the
National Academy of Sciences and the surgeon general, the center
said.
   ``This document is clearly designed not to offend the meat, egg
and dairy industries,'' said Jayne Hurley, associate nutritionist
at the center.
   ``It represents the least common denominator of nutrition
advice,'' she said. ``This is a Band-Aid and the American diet
needs surgery.''
   She criticized the guidelines for advising people to use salt
and sugar ``in moderation.'' The 1985 dietary suggestions said
people should ``avoid too much'' salt or sugar.
   She also noted that the National Academy of Sciences advises
that an ideal diet should contain no more than 7 percent or 8
percent of calories from saturated fat, compared with 10 percent in
the new guidelines.
   She criticized the guidelines for recommending no specific
limits on cholesterol or sodium. The National Academy of Sciences
recommends no more than 200-250 milligrams of cholesterol and 1,800
milligrams of sodium per day, she said.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Mississippi Case on Filing Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that someone
suing more than one defendant generally does not have to include
all of them in the same lawsuit.
   In a unanimous unsigned opinion, the court revived a suit by a
Mississippi man stemming from his back surgery in 1986.
   The patient, Billy J. Temple, had a plate and screw device
implanted in his lower spine. The screws broke off inside his back.
   The operation was performed by Dr. S. Henry LaRocca at St.
Charles General Hospital in New Orleans. The device was made by
Synthes Ltd.
   Temple sued the manufacturer in federal court in Louisiana. He
filed a separate negligence and malpractice suit against the doctor
and hospital in Louisiana state court.
   A federal judge threw out the suit against Synthes and the
decision was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The
federal courts said Temple should have sued all three defendants
together.
   The Supeme Court today reversed those rulings.
   The high court said, ``It has long been the rule that it is not
necessary for all joint tortfeasors (defendants in personal injury
cases) to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit.''
   The court rejected arguments by Synthes that a 1966 revised
court rule changed that principle.
   The justices said that while they encourage ``judicial economy''
and efficiency by suing all defendants together, there is no
evidence LaRocca and the hospital are indispensable to the case
against Synthes.
   Temple's hometown was not available in court papers here.
   The case is Temple vs. Synthes, 90-295.

   A homosexual soldier today won a Supreme Court
battle to re-enlist in the Army despite the military's ban on
homosexuals.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
decision requiring the Army to allow Perry Watkins of Seattle to
re-enlist. Watkins is a 16-year veteran with an excellent service
record.
   Today's action does not affect in any sweeping way the
military's ban on homosexuals. The case nevertheless has been
closely watched by gay rights advocates.
   The appeals court ruling in Watkins' case did not address the
validity of the ban, but noted that the Army repeatedly had
re-enlisted Watkins while knowing he is gay.
   ``Sgt. Watkins has greatly benefited the Army, and therefore the
country, by his military service,'' an 11-judge panel of the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said last year. ``In addition,
Watkins' homosexuality clearly has not hurt the Army in any way ...
Equity cries out and demands that the Army be estopped (prohibited)
from refusing to re-enlist Watkins on the basis of his
homosexuality.''
   In other action, the court:
   - Agreed to use a California murder case to set new guidelilnes
for federal court appeals by convicted defendants who say their
rights were violated.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by state officials in
the case of Owen Duane Nunnemaker, sentenced to life in prison for
murdering his estranged wife in 1975.
   - Let stand a ruling that lets prosecutors punish businesses
convicted of dealing in obscenity by seizing their property.
   The court, without comment, rejected an adult bookstore's
challenge to an Illinois anti-pornography law.
   - Refused to let some Puerto Rico cable TV systems be prosecuted
for carrying The Playboy Channel, rebuffing arguments that states'
anti-obscenity efforts may be hampered unduly.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that such
prosecutions are pre-empted by federal law.
   - Left intact a ruling by Ohio's highest court in a nationally
publicized child-custody case that said the public has no right to
attend juvenile court proceedings.
   The justices, without comment, rejected a Columbus, Ohio,
newspaper's arguments that the Constitution requires most juvenile
court hearings to be public.
   - Let stand a ruling that barred employee benefit plans from
discriminating against workers who are disabled later in their
careers.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by Ohio officials
that younger workers forced to retire because of disabilities are
entitled to greater benefits.
   The appeals court vote in the homosexual soldier case was 7-4.
   In the appeal rejected today, Bush administration lawyers had
argued that the federal government never should be barred from
applying a valid regulation such as the Army's ban on homosexuals.
   Watkins was drafted during the Vietnam war, in 1967. He was 19.
   In filling out a pre-induction medical form, he marked ``yes''
in answering a question that asked whether he had homosexual
tendencies. He was inducted anyway, and subsequently was allowed to
re-enlist three times.
   After two tours of duty in Korea, Watkins was stationed at Fort
Lewis, near Tacoma.
   From 1967 through 1980. he was the subject of three Army
investigations. Each one was sparked by Watkins' telling some
superior about his homosexuality, but after each investigation he
was allowed to re-enlist.
   In 1981, the Army adopted a new regulation requiring the
discharge of all homosexuals.
   A review board in 1982 voted to discharge Watkins, but before
the discharge orders were issued a federal judge barred the Army
from taking such action.
   Seven years of court maneuvering and conflicting rulings
followed before the 11-judge panel's ruling last year. But Watkins
was forced to accept an honorable discharge in 1984 after a
three-judge appeals court panel voted against him.
   His lawsuit against the Army sought reinstatement with back pay.
He would be eligible for a full Army pension with four more years
of service.
   The 1989 ruling in favor of Watkins did not say he was entitled
to back pay, and implied the Army could try to discharge him for
any future homosexual acts.
   But the ruling said the Army ``may not attempt to discharge
Watkins for any alleged homosexual acts that were the subject of
past discharge proceedings or for any past or future statements by
Watkins acknowledging his homosexuality.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Watkins, 89-1806.

<TEXT>
   At least 200 people, mostly
schoolchildren, walked a gauntlet of protesters to look at an
original copy of the Bill of Rights that went on display today in
Maine's capital.
   ``Ask your teacher who Jesse Helms is,'' about a dozen
demonstrators from an AIDS coalition group chanted, referring to
North Carolina's conservative, Republican U.S. senator.
   The demonstrators from the Maine chapter of AIDS Coalition to
Unleash Power, or ACT UP, claims Philip Morris is the largest
corporate donor to Helms' re-election campaign. Helms has drawn the
wrath of the group and other people for consistently voting against
gay rights and bills to help people with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   The Bill of Rights copy is on a national tour to mark the
document's 200th anniversary. The tour is sponsored by Philip
Morris Companies Inc., a tobacco, food and beverage giant.
   Demonstrators held up signs that read: ``Philip Morris Bill of
Rights tour is a politlcal sham.'' They urged consumers to boycott
the company's products.
   With lyrics from the rap group 2 Live Crew blasting from an
amplifier, a half-dozen people demonstrated against attempts to ban
rock lyrics under attack as sexually explicit or otherwise
offensive.
   ``If it's 2 Live Crew this week, who will it be next week?''
said Chris Kenoyer, leader of a group called Rock the Vote.
   Three members of the rap group were acquitted last month of
obscenity charges after their ``Nasty As They Wanna Be'' was banned
in a Florida county.
   A multi-media display accompanies the Bill of Rights. The
display will be at the Augusta Civic Center for four days. Visitors
passed through metal detectors to get to the elaborate display.
   Augusta was the fifth stop on a 26,000-mile tour that will take
the document to all 50 states. The tour began Oct. 10 in Vermont
and also has been to New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New York. The
tour will end in Virginia in February 1992.
   There have been similar demonstrations in other states.
   The Bill of Rights copy on display includes 10 amendments to the
U.S. Constitution and two that were proposed but not approved by
the states.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Age-Bias Lawsuit Against IRS in Texas
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating an age-bias lawsuit against the Internal Revenue
Service by an employee working in Austin, Texas.
   The justices said they will review rulings that Charles Stevens
III waited too long to sue the IRS.
   At issue is an interpretation of the federal Age Discrimination
in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA). Depending on how the high court
rules, in a decision expected by July, suing under the act could
become a bit easier or a bit more difficult.
   Stevens was employed at the IRS Austin Service Center for 19
months before being promoted for a probationary period to a
better-paying job in 1986. But in the spring of 1987, during the
probationary period, he was returned to his old job.
   Stevens, 63, said age discrimination was the reason.
   The merits of his allegation, however, have never been ruled on.
A federal judge, and then the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
ruled that Stevens' suit was barred because he had waited too long
before filing it.
   Under the ADEA, federal employees who believe they have been
discriminated against because of their age have two avenues of
relief. They may sue in federal court as long as they give notice
of their intent to sue within 180 days of the allegedly unlawful
action. Or they may file a complaint within 30 days with the
employing agency, and appeal any adverse ruling to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
   Stevens waited beyond 30 days before filing a complaint with the
IRS, and the complaint was dismissed as untimely.
   Stevens gave notice of his intent to file his federal lawsuit
176 days from the date of the alleged discrimination - within the
legal deadline.
   But the lower courts ruled that Stevens' failure to comply with
the complaint-filing deadline also required the dismissal of his
separate lawsuit.
   The case is Stevens vs. Department of Treasury, 89-1821.

   A series of explosions shook a Mobil Oil
Corp. refinery and set off a fire that severly burned an employee,
authorities said.
   The first explosion occurred about 11:30 p.m. Sunday. The fire
was put out by early today, officials said.
   The fire erupted in a unit used for gasoline refining, said
plant safety manager Jack Cohn. The cause was not immediately
known, he said.
   Mobil employee John Oler, 38, of Chalmette was taken to
Chalmette Medical Center and transferred to West Jefferson Hospital
with burns over 70 percent of his body, said Donna Shields, a
spokeswoman for the medical center.
   The plant was not evacuated and all employees were accounted
for, officials said.
   Richelle Lewis, who lives about five miles away in Miro, said
she heard a ``loud whoom followed by three explosions. I turned
around and the sky was all red.''
   The refinery is about six miles east of New Orleans.

<TEXT>
   Charles Stuart's lawyer does not have to testify
to a grand jury about a conversation he had with his client the day
before Stuart leaped to his death from a bridge, the state Supreme
Court ruled today.
   The court in a 4-1 ruling said John T. Dawley's attorney-client
privilege was not undone with his client's suicide on Jan. 4 that
threw a final twist in the deeply mysterious plot to kill Stuart's
wife, Carol.
   ``The mouth of the attorney shall be forever sealed,'' the court
wrote.
   ``The privilege of insisting that the attorney keep confidential
the client's disclosures made to the attorney in his or her
professional capacity belongs only to the client, and therefore can
be waived only by the client,'' the court said in a decision
written by Justice Francis P. O'Connor.
   The Suffolk County District Attorney's office had wanted Dawley
to testify before a grand jury gathering evidence in the death of
Carol Stuart, a tax attorney who was shot and killed Oct. 23, 1989.
   Dawley met with Stuart for about two hours on Jan. 3, and
investigators contend that the 30-year-old fur store manager
admitted to his lawyer that he killed his wife.
   The next day, Stuart jumped to his death off the Tobin Bridge
into Boston Harbor.
   Officials at the district attorney's office were in conference
this morning and could not immediately be reached for comment.
   Dawley declined to comment on the court's ruling until he
received a copy.
   ``I'd like to read it before I comment on that,'' he said.
   A grand jury has met periodically since, attempting to piece
together details of the crime. No charges have been filed.
   Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Mundy argued
that the grand jury would be deprived of ``potentially relevant
information'' if Dawley did not testify.
   Paul Leary, first assistant district attorney, said the grand
jury, which has made little progress in recent weeks, has been
waiting for the decision on Dawley.
   But attorneys representing the Stuart family argued that the
court would be setting a dangerous precedent by tampering with the
attorney-client privilege.
   Charles Stuart originally told police he and his pregnant wife
were attacked by a lone, black gunman in their car after they left
a birthing class. The couple's baby, delivered prematurely after
the shooting, died 17 days later.
   Stuart, shot in the stomach, called police on his cellular phone
and when he lost consciousness emergenc operators located him by
listening for police car sirens heard over the phone.
   The case intensified racial friction in Boston after police
stormed homes in a black neighborhood in search of Mrs. Stuart's
killer.
   But Stuart became the prime suspect after his brother, Matthew,
implicated him in the crime. Matthew Stuart told authorities that
under his brother's instructions, he drove to the crime scene and
retrieved several personal belongings of Carol Stuart, plus a gun
believed to be the murder weapon.
   Dorothy Stuart, Stuart's mother and the executor of his estate,
has told the grand jury she couldn't waive her son attorney-client
privilege, and she would not have done so if the law had allowed
her.
   The state had argued that Stuart, having died, ``no longer can
be harmed by the disclosure of his communications to his attorney''
and that the privilege should be overridden because of ``society's
interest'' in finding who killed Carol Stuart and her son.
   But the court disagreed with that contention, saying that ``the
client's and the public's interests are best served by a rule of
confidentiality that applies both before and after the death of the
client.''
   In his dissent, Justice Joseph R. Nolan said that despite the
court's ruling, attorney-client privilege is not absolute, and the
possibility that Charles Stuart did not kill his wife meant the
killer could still be on the loose.
   ``Under the court's analysis, there is no `safety valve,' no
mechanism by which the attorney-client privilege may ever be
overridden by the court in the interests of justice,'' Nolan wrote.
``I would argue the court to adopt this very narrow `interests of
justice' exception.''
   Leo V. Boyle, president of the Massachusetts Bar Association,
said the attorney client privilege ``is of ancient origin, and is
at the heart of the delivery of justice. Once you bend the law for
a single case, no matter how tragic, the legal framework of our
society starts to crumble. The court did the unpopular thing, but
undoubtedly the right thing.''

<HEAD>Because of Redistricting, Legislative Races Are High Stakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allyson Schwartz kicked off her state Senate
campaign with a 15-mile bike ride and has spent endless hours doing
what's expected of legislative candidates: knocking on doors,
staking out supermarkets and greeting commuters at train stops.
   She's also spent more than $500,000 just to keep pace with her
opponent, Republican Sen. Joe Rocks.
   ``There's a lot at stake in this race,'' Schwartz says.
   The nation's political map will be redrawn next year to reflect
population shifts of the last decade.
   Most of the work will be done in state legislatures. And the
finished product will go a long way in determining which party will
make gains in 1992 House races - and whether Republicans have any
hope of climbing out of the minority beforethe close of the
century.
   The Schwartz-Rocks contest is just one of more than 6,100
legislative races to be decided across the country Tuesday. In the
high-stakes battle for redistricting leverage, about 50 of those
races in a dozen states will make the difference, deciding which
party controls legislative chambers that are held by slim
majorities.
   National political party organizations have paid close attention
to oft-ignored state races this year, offering candidates lots of
advice and, more important, money.
   ``Control of redistricting is control of your future,'' said Tim
Dickson, director of the Democratic Party's major redistricting
arm, Project 500.
   In Pennsylvania, Democrats control the state House and
Democratic Gov. Robert Casey appears headed for re-election.
Republicans need to keep their majority in the state Senate for
leverage in redistricting, which likely will cost Pennsylvania two
seats in Congress.
   If Democrats pick up three state Senate seats, the party would
have a coveted redistricting monopoly and could squeeze out two
Republicans.
   Pennsylvania Democrats think their chances may rest on the
Schwartz-Rocks contest.
   ``I'm in the toughest fight in Pennsylvania,'' Rocks says.
   There are similar struggles in several other major redistricting
battlegrounds.
   Democrats are trying to steal control of the state Senates in
New York, Ohio, Michigan, Arizona and Indiana. The lower houses in
Arizona and Indiana also are within reach for Democrats.
   Republicans are defending their control of those chambers and
trying to erase slim Democratic majorities in the Florida and
Illinois senates and the lower chambers in Pennsylvania and Oregon.
   Gubernatorial races in several states, including the three
biggest redistricting prizes - Florida, Texas and California - also
will have a huge role in determining who draws the all-important
new district lines.
   Democrats have a decided edge entering Tuesday's vote.
   They already control 69 of the nation's 99 legislative chambers,
including total control in Florida, Texas and California, three
states that are likely to gobble up 14 of the 19 shifting seats.
   ``We're looking at a situation here where it's vital for us to
hang on to what we have just to be in a divided or split
position,'' said Tom Hoeffler of the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
   Such high stakes translates into hefty spending: The
Rocks-Schwartz matchup is one of a handful of state legislative
races that will cost $1 million or more.
   The extra money has allowed candidates in targeted races to hire
big-name consultants for flashy mailers and radio ads, polling and
to build phone banks to get out the vote.
   Most - but not all - of the candidates welcome the attention.
   ``I regret all of this in a way,'' said Jerry Denbo, an
insurance salesman in French Lick, Ind., who may be the Democrats'
best hope for erasing the GOP's razor-thin majority in the Indiana
House.
   ``I'd really rather it be decided by the people in these
counties,'' he said.
   South Bend lawyer Joe Donnelly seemed surprised when told the
people at Democratic Party headquarters in Washington figured their
chances of capturing the Indiana Senate might come down to his
effort to oust an incumbent Republican.
   ``I didn't realize that,'' Donnelly said. ``I better win.''
   It's not just in states that are losing or gaining congressional
seats that legislative races are getting extra attention.
   All congressional districts have to be redrawn, even if a
state's delegation is unchanged. In most states, the legislature is
charged with redrawing its own districts as well.
   Because of that, even getting enough seats to be a viable
minority - or to prevail in veto battles - is important.
   In the 75-member Utah House, Democrats are scrambling just to
remain a one-third minority, figuring if they can keep their 27
seats they'll be able to scream loudly enough to have some input
when the state districts are redrawn.
   ``The Republicans have promised to reapportion us out of
existence,'' said Democratic state Rep. Frank Pignanelli, the
minority whip.
   ``They accomplished it in 1980 ,and if they do it again this
really will be a one-party state.''

<DATELINE>OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young woman who claims to have 21
personalities may herself be on trial this week as much as the man
accused of raping her.
   The trial, which has raised new questions about sexual consent
and mental illness, began today with jury selection in state court,
where the prosecution is expected to call to the stand six of the
personalities documented by psychiatrists.
   Mark A. Peterson, 29, of Oshkosh, is charged with second-degree
sexual assault, which carries up to 10 years in prison. Prosecutors
claim he had sex with one of the woman's personalities after
learning she was mentally ill.
   Under Wisconsin law, a person with a mental illness or
deficiency so severe that he cannot understand the consequences of
his behavior is incapable of consenting to sex. It will be up to
the jury to decide whether the woman in the case is ill to that
degree.
   ``I have to prove that it (multiple personality disorder) is
real and she's got it,'' District Attorney Joe Paulus said. ``In a
case like this, there are always going to be skeptics.''
   The defense is expected to argue that the alleged victim, a
27-year-old single woman from Oshkosh, is not mentally ill and that
even if she is, Peterson did not know it.
   Judge Robert Hawley said the jury will be sequestered during the
trial. A jury was expected to be seated and opening arguments to
begin later today.
   Defense attorney Edward Salzsieder said he would try to convince
the jury the woman was putting on a ``big show.'' He said the
nature of the case requires the woman to go on trial as much as the
defendant.
   The woman took the stand during a riveting preliminary hearing
in August, blinking her eyes and pausing each time she was asked to
switch personalities.
   The judge required her to take an oath each time. Each time, she
was introduced to the lawyers in the case.
   Revealing the alternate personalities to the jury is ``my
vehicle to show the victim's credibility,'' the prosecutor said.
``They are going to get to see her the way she is. She is a person
of several personalities.''
   Paulus said he would probably ask the woman to reveal six
personalities.
   Defendants have claimed multiple personality disorder in
mounting an insanity defense, but legal experts said they were not
aware of any case in which such a disorder in a victim formed the
crux of a case.
   Paulus said the case ``is really all about protecting the rights
of mentally ill people, regardless of what type of mental illness
they have.''
   Inam Haque, a psychiatrist at Winnebago Mental Health Institute
in Oshkosh, has testified he treated the woman for four years and
diagnosed her in February as suffering from multiple personality
disorder.
   The disorder is triggered by emotional or physical trauma during
childhood; victims create separate personalities to avoid
confronting reality. It affects about 7,000 people in the United
States, psychiatrists said.
   Peterson has said the woman agreed to have sex with him in a car
June 11 after he picked her up for a date.
   She testified that she told Peterson she had many personalities
and that he took advantage of one of them, Jennifer, a fun-loving
20-year-old.
   During the preliminary hearing, the woman summoned three
identities - herself, Jennifer, and Franny, a 32-year-old motherly
type who reported the alleged rape to friends.
   The woman, who earned an associate degree in law enforcement
from an Iowa college, has other personalities called Animal, Shadow
and Emily, according to testimony. One of her male identities is a
bodybuilder named Brian.
   She told the court that when an alternate ego takes over, her
primary personality goes into a ``dark place, a place of
nothingness. Time is not passing there.''

   Families of some of the Americans being held by the Iraqi
government got telephone calls from their loved ones over the
weekend, and a few of the hostages were evasive on some subjects.
   Ann Hoffman of Columbus, Ga., said her son Miles called home
about noon Saturday. He was a financial analyst and investor for
the Kuwaiti government before the Iraqi invasion.
   ``He said they were lined up at the telephone. A whole lot of
them'' were being allowed to call home, she said.
   Mrs. Hoffman, who has been concerned about her son's health
since he was shot in the arm by an Iraqi soldier during an escape
attempt Sept. 5, said her son's call was disconnected when she
asked about his wound.
   ``I asked how his arm was. I told them the (recently released)
French hostages told us he was not allowed to exercise - or
couldn't exercise because it hurt,'' she said. ``He said something
about `they must have seen my X-rays,' then we were cut off.
   ``Then he called back about half an hour later. I tried to
discuss it again, but he said he didn't want to talk about him, he
wanted to hear about all of us. ... He didn't want to discuss
himself at all.''
   Charles Keegan, 56, was allowed to call his daughters, Cathi Van
Baale and Peg Keegan, in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday.
   ``He was really evasive,'' Ms. Van Baale said, adding that she
thought the call was monitored. ``My sister asked him if he was
being treated OK and he just changed subjects.
   ``He sounded kind of disgusted, like `Let's get this over with.'
''
   The women said Keegan told them not to worry about him because
he is not ``at a crucial site,'' a reference to the Iraqi
government putting foreign hostages at key military installations
as human shields.
   Jim Brown said his twin brother Cecil was allowed to make a
brief phone call Sunday to his wife and sons in metro Atlanta.
   Today is the twin brothers' birthday and Jim Brown, also of the
Atlanta area, said the call was ``a gift in itself.'' But he said
it would be ``a very empty day. ... Our birthday has always been
thought of in terms of two. This situation interrupted that.''
   Others plan more direct contact. Mary Trundy, 44, of Brockton,
Mass., says she'll spend Christmas in Baghdad with her twin
brother, John Stevenson.
   ``If this helps John's morale, so be it,'' she said.
   The U.S. government has urged families of captives in Iraq and
Kuwait to ignore Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's offer to let them
visit over Christmas. The White House fears the families could
become hostages, too.

<TEXT>
   Whenever the military option is debated as
a solution to the Persian Gulf crisis, eyes turn to Turkey's
military force of 800,000 men, the second-largest standing army in
the Western alliance.
   Under the scenario of a ``second front,'' Turkish soldiers,
supported by U.S. aircraft, could push from the north into Iraq,
while the allied war machine in Saudi Arabia attacked from the
south.
   But President Turgut Ozal, speaking to reporters last week, said
any such scenario is a ``figment of the imagination.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who visits Turkey this
week, is said to be trying to pin down allies about their
willingness to fight Saddam Hussein, if it comes to that.
   Such talk makes many Turks nervous.
   Turkey's armed forces are large in numbers but short on
firepower. Some equipment dates from the Korean war.
   In the past decade, Turkey has tried to modernize its army, but
its leaders say it has not gotten enough support from its NATO
allies. Equipment being moved from the European theater as part of
Western arms reduction agreements with the Soviets will be made
available to Turkey eventually.
   But any war in the gulf is likely to be over by then.
   Moreover, Turkey is unprepared for a posssible chemical weapons
attack from Iraq. It lacks shelters, gas antidotes and gas masks
and a good civil defense organization.
   Saddam has used chemical weapons in the past, against Iran
during the 1980-88 war and against the rebellious Kurds.
   Turkey itself has had to contend with a long-running Kurdish
rebellion, and its army spent years doing battle with guerrillas in
the rugged mountains.
   ``Turkey has not a single soldier to send or a bullet to waste
in the deserts of Arabia,'' wrote Hasan Pulur, one of the nation's
most popular columnists in the newspaper Milliyet.
   Despite such misgivings, Turkey has come down firmly on the side
of the anti-Iraq coalition since the start of the crisis. Soon
after Iraq took over Kuwait on Aug. 2, Turkey closed down twin
pipelines carrying Iraqi crude oil, effectively cutting off more
than half of Iraq's oil exports.
   Turkey has also blocked Iraq's land access to the West, banning
all bilateral and transit trade. After the United Nations
authorized an air embargo on Iraq, Turkey began forcing Iraq-bound
aircraft to land and be searched.
   As a result of all this, Turkey's relations with its southern
neighbor are seriously damaged. Diplomats and analysts say Turkey
will now have a hostile neighbor to contend with as long as Saddam
stays in power.
   Even though they want Saddam out, Turks hope they won't have to
go to war to accomplish that. In several public opinion polls
conducted after the outbreak of the gulf crisis, three-fourths of
the respondents opposed Turkey's involvement in any military
action.
   The Turks also are being careful to stress that they have no
territorial designs on Iraq, although they lost some land when
borders in the region were re-drawn after World War I. The Turks
had been allied with the losing Germans.
   Iraq cited historical claims on Kuwait as among the reasons for
its attack.
   In Turkey these days, one commonly expressed fear is that the
Western countries that need Turkey's help now will forget about it
later.
   ``Once the crisis is over, we will be immediately forgotten. It
will be business as usual for the Western powers that sold all the
chemical weapons equipment to Iraq,'' said one government official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   According to World Bank estimates, Turkey is the hardest hit by
the international economic sanctions against Iraq, with its losses
expected to total about $7 billion a year.
   That includes lost revenue from the pipeline, bilateral trade,
construction business, unpaid Iraqi debts and tourist revenues.
   Other nations have said they will help make up the losses. So
far, Japan has pledged $200 million, Kuwait $300 million, Germany
$74 million and France $30 million.
   But Saudi Arabia has not responded yet to requests for cheaper
oil or favorable loans, and there is no word yet from the United
States on Ozal's request to lift restrictions on Turkey's
competitive export goods, such as textiles, and iron and steel.
   Higher oil prices pushed up Turkish consumer prices by 8.7
percent in September and 6.8 percent in October.
   The government already has authorization from Parliament to send
Turkish troops abroad and allow deployment of foreign troops here.
But most officials believe application of the measure will be
limited, perhaps only permitting U.S. aircraft to use the Incirlik
NATO base in southern Turkey as a staging area.
   Although Ozal's executive powers are limited under Turkey's
parliamentary system, he confers on the phone every week with
President Bush and other world leaders.
   Ozal has repeatedly stressed that this Moslem country with
secular laws is a bridge between East and West. He hopes the risks
he is taking now will pay off later, perhaps leading to Turkish
membership in the European Community.

   A deer broke through a bank's window and
smashed three others Monday, apparently mistaking its reflection
for a rival, authorities said.
   It took police and game wardens about an hour to get the
bleeding buck out of the Mellon Bank branch.
   ``What happened was he broke one window trying to get in and
three others trying to get out,'' Police Chief Jack Lively said.
   A road crew used shovels to break the rest of the glass, lined
up and drove the buck through the window and into a nearby forest.
   The damage was mostly blood stains and glass in the lobby, bank
spokeswoman Norma Buhrman said.
   Game wardens and police suspect the buck thought his reflection
in the bank's window was a rival. Deer are in their mating season
and become protective of their turf.

   Agriculture officials expect to declare
victory this week in the 16-month, $52 million campaign to
eradicate the crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit fly from Southern
California.
   But the continued arrival of illegal fruit and vegetables,
usually carried in travelers' luggage, virtually ensures future
infestations, officials said Sunday.
   ``There is some perverse streak in human nature. They seem to
believe its fun to outsmart authorities and bring in just one mango
or just one pineappple from Hawaii,'' said Gera Curry, spokeswoman
for the state Department of Food and Agriculture. ``All it takes is
one person.''
   Quarantines could be lifted by Thursday or Friday in areas of
Southern California, Curry said. No flies were found in traps last
month, but officials want to be certain the flies really are gone
before declaring victory, she said.
   The quarantines were imposed on movement of fruit from infested
areas. The big worry was that the flies could spread to
agricultural areas and wreck California's $18 billion-a-year farm
industry.
   Slightly smaller than a common housefly, the Medfly lays its
eggs in fruit and vegetables, causing them to rot.
   Florida declared victory over the Medfly in August, four months
after finding a single fly near Miami International Airport. The
state spent less than $1.6 million for eight sprayings over a
20-square-mile area to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible.
   ``Our immediate reaction upon discovery of the Medfly and our
all-out effort ... provides a vivid contrast between Florida's
eradication program and what's happening in California,'' said
Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner.
   The fly has plagued California farmers since the early 1980s.
From 1980 to 1982 state and federal officials spent $100 million to
battle the pest, and farmers lost $100 million in damaged crops.
   The latest infestation caused a public outcry when the state
repeatedly sent helicopters to spray the pesticide malathion in a
500-square-mile area encompassing dozens of communities. Citizens
filed 300 damage claims and numerous lawsuits.
   Emotions continue to run high, and opponents of aerial spraying
disputed the state's claim of victory.
   ``They're saying victory because it will calm us down, but it's
a political facade,'' said Pat Reichenberger, a former Monterey
Park mayor who opposed spraying over his community. ``I don't think
it's over by any means. They'll be back.''
   Roy Cunningham, chairman of the state Medfly Science Advisory
Panel, said if the fly returns, enhanced detection measures should
prevent infestations from reaching the same scale. In 1980 and
1989, the state waited too long to begin eradication, he said.

   They dine on canned tuna fish and fresh dates,
shinny up the palm trees on the compound, compete in tennis and
fight boredom.
   They spend part of every day trying to keep in touch with a
secret network of fellow Americans in hiding in Kuwait and with
their bosses back home. At night, they shiver when the temperature
drops and worry about not having any blankets as the winter chill
sets in.
   There are eight U.S. diplomats holding out inside the American
Embassy compound in Kuwait. They are joined by 19 private citizens
who sought refuge in the embassy. President Bush says Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is trying to ``starve them out.''
   Most other Western countries that tried to keep their embassies
open after Iraq ordered them closed have given up and pulled their
people out. Two British diplomats, the ambassador and a consul, are
still in their separate embassy about a mile away.
   The grounds are surrounded by Iraqi troops, and no one is
permitted to enter or leave.
   But the four men and four women picked by the State Department
to stay behind have kept the embassy operating despite growing
personal discomfort.
   The department has provided few details of life inside the
Kuwait embassy. But several officials agreed to discuss the
situation there on condition they not be identified, and, with
tidbits from the public record, provided a glimpse of life within
the walls of the isolated U.S. outpost at the center of the Gulf
crisis.
   In the three weeks between the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the
Aug. 24 deadline for shutting down all diplomatic facilities in the
capital of the overrun emirate, the seaside compound's occupants
stocked up on non-perishable food and bottled water, laying in
substantial quantities against the time when supplies would be cut
off.
   At the time, more than 100 Americans occupied the ambassador's
residence, chancery, three-story administration building and a
cluster of prefabricated buildings that were shipped in after a
truck bomb destroyed half the administration building in a 1983
terrorist attack. Many of those who sought refuge in the compound
brought possessions and food with them and left much of it behind
when they got out just before the embassy was sealed off.
   Officials refuse to say just what remains because they want to
keep the Iraqis guessing how long the Americans can hold out. Bush
said Thursday, ``They have enough right now.''
   Shortly after the Aug. 24 deadline set by the Iraqis,
electricity and water to the compound were cut off. The loss of air
conditioning made the blistering heat almost unbearable, and some
people chose to sleep outdoors to avoid the stifling rooms in the
ambassador's residence or offices that had been converted to
sleeping quarters in the administration building.
   There weren't enough generators or fuel to keep the freezers
running, so the frozen food, mostly turkey, was eaten first. There
was plenty at first, but it spoiled--none too soon for some
compound inmates tired of the steady turkey diet. They've since
resorted to canned tuna, supplemented by rice and fresh dates that
grow on the compound.
   With the water cut off, they couldn't use toilets, so they dug a
trench at one side of the compound and use it as a latrine.
   There were no showers, but they continued to use the swimming
pool as long as possible. Sources say it is stagnant now, and the
water unsuitable for most uses.
   Last week, however, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
disclosed the embassy occupants had dug a well and struck water
good enough for washing - they even washed their cars just to show
off for the guards - and to water the vegetable garden they've
planted behind the ambassador's house. They have yet to harvest any
vegetables but are reported hopeful they will have a crop before
the desert temperatures drop into the 30s in mid-winter.
   ``They're very elated about their new well,'' said Margie
Howell, wife of U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, who was packing
to come home when the invasion blocked his departure. Mrs. Howell,
who had left a short time before, told the NBC Today Show last week
she goes to the State Department every day and speaks to her
husband over a special satellite telephone link that keeps
communications open between the embassy and Washington.
   The principal assignment of those who remain behind is to keep
in contact with the 600 or so Americans who are still in hiding in
Kuwait to avoid being rounded up and added to the ranks of the
``human shield'' Saddam Hussein has assembled to protect strategic
installations from attack.
   The loal phones still work, but the State Department says the
Iraqis tap the embassy phone lines to try to catch Americans in
hiding. To keep conversation to a minimum and prevent the Iraqis
from tracing calls to people's hideouts, sources said, the
diplomats use Voice of America radio broadcasts to signal citizens
to call when there is news about evacuation flights, medicine or
emergencies. And the embassy tries to maintain a team of
``wardens'' beyond the walls who serve as intermediaries between
the diplomats and those in hiding.
   When they're not working the phones, Mrs. Howell said, those
inside the compound work out on exercise equipment left behind by
the Marine guards, read and play cards.
   ``Actually, this is our third war,'' she told NBC. ``We were in
Egypt in '67, and then we were in Beirut in '75 when that war
started.''

   Voters decide Tuesday whether to elect this
U.S. territory's first woman governor or re-elect a governor for
the first time ever.
   Republican Gov. Joseph Ada is running for re-election against
Democratic territorial Sen. Madeline Bordallo, widow of former Gov.
Ricardo J. Bordallo, who chained himself to a statue in a busy
Agana intersection and shot himself to death Jan. 30.
   Ricardo Bordallo was convicted of federal extortion charges and
was to have begun serving an 18-month prison sentence Jan. 31.
   Ada, 46, who defeated Ricardo Bordallo in 1986, held a 2-to-1
edge over Madeline Bordallo, according to a poll by the Pacific
Daily News.
   If he wins, Ada would be the western Pacific island's first
governor to be re-elected. Bordallo, 57, would be the territory's
first woman governor, and the first who is not a native Guamanian.
She is originally from Minnesota.
   Ada and Bordallo differ on few issues. Both advocate controlled
development, and back an appeal of the territory's restrictive
abortion law.
   Pro-choice advocates were urging voters to boycott the
gubernatorial election to protest the candidates' abortion stand.

   Sunrise comes to the Persian Gulf as you strap
youself into your F-15 fighter jet and roar away from the deck of a
carrier. Welcome to the gulf war - in a video game simulation.
   MicroProse Software Inc. of Hunt Valley, Md., is giving would-be
fighter jocks a chance to test their mettle with the closest thing
to combat simulators: highly sophisticated video games.
   One of the games, F-15 Strike Eagle, has been especially
popular. It contains a war scenario in which jets blow up enemy oil
and military sites while outrunning tank and missile fire.
   Sales of F-15 Strike Eagle, Gunship, Airborne Ranger and other
games are up 30 percent since the crisis began Aug. 2 when Iraq
invaded Kuwait, said MicroProse spokeswoman Kathy Gilmore.
   ``We think it's because of the Middle East crisis. We think
people know what's happening over there and our games realistically
simulate a situation,'' she said.
   Even soldiers in Saudi Arabia may soon be at the controls of
Strike Eagle. One of the game units is being flown out Tuesday for
servicemen to kill time and imaginary enemies in the absence of
outright hostilities.
   Gilmore declined to give exact sales figures, but said 500,000
``computer pilots'' are now enjoying the F-15 simulation on home
machines, in addition to thousands playing the game at
coin-operated video arcades.
   MicroProse engineer David Bellamy, who demonstrated the game
last week for a rapt audience at New York's noisy Broadway Arcade,
said it's so real ``you start to feel like a real fighter jock.''
   He put 50 cents in the console, throttled up his jet and took
off on a mission on which he shot down an enemy plane and blew up
oil tanks and two enemy speedboats, accompanied by stereo sound
effects.
   Players gaping around the video console gave F-15 a thumbs-up.
   ``It's real fun,'' said 16-year-old Jesus Malena.
   MicroProse is preparing a more sophisticated gulf war game for
personal computers. The scenario is being built into a game
tentatively entitled Gunship 2000, awaiting a spring release at an
expected retail price of $59-$69.
   Gunship 2000's chief designer, Jim Day, said its gulf scenario
will feature Army helicopters that go out to destroy military and
oil installations while rescuing ``guests'' detained at the sites.
   Playes select types and numbers of helicopters and weaponry, and
bone up on maps and intelligence before their missions. No two
missions are ever played the same way.
   Day said his researchers combed large amounts of publicly
available military data for precise details on weapons and tactics,
including the sounds they make.
   ``We are certainly not promoting war or anything, but an
individual using the game as a simulation can relate to it,'' he
explained.
   Ted Markley, MicroProse vice president of product development,
underscored the point that no one wants a real war.
   In fact, he said, ``If we could send our product to Saddam
Hussein and say, `Let you play this and we'll play yours,' then
let's send our troops home.''

<HEAD>`Big Green' Vote Among Tests of Environment Movement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $36 million battle over four
California ballot issues that could shape the course of the
environmental movement may have bought little more than voter
confusion.
   Tuesday's vote on Proposition 128, called ``Big Green'' by its
champions, is billed as a pivotal test for the national
environmental movement. It features an ecologists' dream list of
restrictions on offshore drilling, pesticide use and other
pollutants.
   But a poll released Friday found ``Big Green'' has lost its big
lead and is now trailing. Forty-three percent surveyed in a
California Poll opposed it, 41 percent were in favor and 16 percent
were undecided.
   Analysts say many Californians are confused by ``Big Green'' and
the three other conflicting environmental initiatives affecting
logging and pesticides.
   Various industries have spent $10 million condemning it as an
economic disaster. They've also disparagingly dubbed it the
``Hayden Initiative'' after supporter Tom Hayden, a state
assemblyman who still evokes strong emotions as a symbol of '60s
anti-Vietnam War activism.
   Big business and environmentalists have spent a combined $36
million campaigning for and against the four issues. Industry has
outspent environmentalists 2-1.
   Foes and supporters, each citing expert studies, have made
wildly differing claims about the multibillion-dollar impact of the
initiatives that would control emissions, pesticides, offshore
oil-drilling and logging.
   California Poll director Mervin Field said confusion may prompt
the electorate to vote no on all four issues ``as a way of
maintaining the status quo.''
   ``It's a horrible mess,'' said A. Alan Post, a former analyst
for the Legislature. ``If you try to read the voter pamphlet, it's
very difficult. If you try to read the propositions themselves,
it's worse.''
   The environmental cause faces other ballot tests Tuesday:
   -A Washington state initiative would require local governments
to adopt land use plans to conform to state growth and
environmental goals.
   -An Oregon measure would impose tight new recycling standards,
and a second would shut down the state's only nuclear power plant.
   -Two South Dakota initiatives would curb gold and silver mining
and regulate large garbage dumps.
   -Missouri's proposed ``Natural Streams Act'' would protect Ozark
waterways.
   -A proposed $1.9 billion environmental bond in New York state
would be used to acquire land for preservation, help close
landfills and promote recycling.
   Among the other California measures, Proposition 130, dubbed
``Forests Forever,'' would restrict clear-cutting of forests and
authorize bonds for purchase of old-growth redwoods. The issue held
a narrowing lead in the latest opinion polls.
   Two industry-backed rivals to ``Forests Forever'' and ``Big
Green'' would impose far less stringent restrictions on pesticides
and logging.
   ``Forests Forever'' opponents, principally timber and
wood-processing firms, have spent nearly $10 million mostly on
television ads warning that the measure would increase fire danger
by altering logging practices.
   Millionaire investment counselor Harold Arbit has given $5.1
million to the campaign for the measure, setting a state record for
an individual contribution. Overall, backers have raised about $6.5
million.
   ``My banker keeps saying, `Are you sure you want to do this? Are
you sure it's worth it?' And I keep asking myself what material
possession would I rather have, versus knowing that I've helped
save a unique natural heritage,'' Arbit said.
   ``Big Green'' supporters, who raised $4.5 million, say it would
preserve ancient redwood forests, slow global warming by gradually
curbing auto and other emissions, ban oil development in state
waters and bar pesticides suspected of causing cancer. It also
would create an elective post of environmental czar.
   Proponents - including Hollywood stars Jane Fonda, Chevy Chase
and Sylvester Stallone - argue that the sweeping measure includes a
patchwork of legislation rejected by lawmakers under pressure from
special interests. They say it would save Californians several
billion dollars in energy and health costs each year.
   But foes, including major oil companies based outside the state,
insist it would cost Californians billions each year because
controls would increase gasoline, electricity and food prices.
   Critics add that, if it passes, it would also fall short of
goals and become snarled in legal battles.

   A pessimistic electorate heard the final, frenzied appeals
Monday of a midterm campaign in which the governorships of
California, Texas and Florida are the key to partisan hopes for
victory.
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida forecast a
come-from-behind victory over former Sen. Lawton Chiles, who held a
narrow lead in the polls.
   ``I think when the votes are all counted tomorrow that we will
have been successful ... and be the first Republican governor
re-elected in the state of Florida,'' said Martinez as he left for
a day of get-out-the-vote rallies.
   President Bush campaigned in Texas for embattled GOP
gubernatorial nominee Clayton Williams, whose once-solid lead over
Democrat Ann Richards melted in the heat of a long and nasty
campaign.
   ``I urge all Texans ... to get out there and vote and do not
take democracy for granted ... You have a chance to make a
difference,'' said the president as he campaigned to boost
Republican turnout.
   Neither party is anticipating major changes in Congress,
although several senior legislators are battling for survival,
including Republican Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Mark
Hatfield of Oregon and Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota.
   The mood of the electorate was variously described as
pessimistic, unhappy, angry, and turned off. What reaction that
might bring on Election Day was the major unknown. Would voters
throw out incumbents, or just stay home?
   Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup poll, said
Americans are deeply concerned about the economy and
dissatisfaction is at its highest level in eight years.
   ``This is a very Democratic mood out there,'' said pollster
Louis Harris. ``There's no sign of the late Republican surge some
have talked about.''
   In Illinois, Democrat Neil Hartigan celebrated a poll that said
he was 14 points ahead of Republican Jim Edgar in the race for
governor. Another poll showed Edgar 2 points ahead.
   ``People feel very strongly that it is time for a change,'' said
Hartigan. He and Edgar are battling to succeed Republican Gov. Jim
Thompson, who is retiring after 14 years in office.
   At a news conference in North Carolina, Helms denied he has made
race an issue in his campaign against Democratic challenger Harvey
Gantt.
   ``I was born white and he was born black and there was nothing
either one of us could do about it,'' said the senator. ``We have
not made an issue of race, but he has gone around the state
pleading for the bloc vote. He has a right to do that. But that has
injected race into it.''
   While Democrats were optimistic about their chances in the
Florida governor's race, Republicans saw things going their way in
California, where the governorship was the year's biggest electoral
prize.
   Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein were
closing out their campaigns by heading in opposite directions -
Wilson flying south and Feinstein heading north - for a long day of
campaign rallies.
   Former President Reagan was joining Wilson at stops in Orange
County and San Diego.
   In Texas, Richards spent the final weekend of the campaign
hammering at Williams for his failure to pay income taxes in 1986,
a year in which the oil millionaire says he was ``fighting for my
life.''
   ``It was a bad year for school teachers,'' said Richards, ``but
they paid their taxes. ... It was a bad year for all people who
work for a living, but they paid their income tax.''
   Bush picked a name at random from the Houston telephone book
Sunday and appealed to Mary Johnson to support Williams and the
Republican ticket on Tuesday. The woman told the president she
would vote - later she told reporters she was a Democrat who would
cast her ballot for Richards.
   No Senate race was getting more attention than the pitched
battle in North Carolina between Helms and Gantt. The race was too
close to call, with everyone wary of opinion surveys in a
polarizing contest between Helms, the symbol of hardline
conservatism, and Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte.
   Two other senior Republicans were battling unexpectedly tough
challenges.
   In Minnesota, Boschwitz appeared to have widened his lead over
Democrat Paul Wellstone. But the chaotic political situation in a
state where the GOP nominee for governor resigned from the ticket
after allegations of sexual impropriety, left analysts wary of
jumping to any conclusions.
   Hatfield also appeared to be recovering from a scare from
Democratic businessman Harry Lonsdale, but the race remained too
close to call.
   The best Republican hope for a pickup was in traditionally
Democratic Hawaii, where Rep. Pat Saiki was challenging appointed
Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka.
   All told, 36 states will elect governors on Tuesday and voters
will fill 34 Senate seats and the entire U.S. House. Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston of Louisiana won re-election last month when he
received more than 50 percent of the vote in an open primary
contest against former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke.
   Democrats control the Senate by a margin of 55 to 45 and the
House 258 to 175. Of the nation's governors, 29 are Democrats and
21 are Republicans.
   Pollsters predict people who go to the polls this year are
likely to be in a gloomy and downright ugly mood.
   A nationwide New York Times-CBS survey depicted an electorate
pessimistic about the economy and unhappy with its government. The
survey of 1,445 adults reported that nearly four in 10 people
surveyed expect things to get worse in the country. Only three in
10 expect them to improve.
   Two-thirds of those responding believe the economy is in bad
shape and 77 percent believe government is run by special interests
looking out for themselves.
   Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic Party, predicted
Election Day gains across the board, adding to the party's majority
of the nation's governors and increasing its margins of control
over the Senate and House.
   White House staff chief John Sununu said he was ready to declare
victory if the Republicans avoided the losses in Congress generally
absorbed by the president's party in his first midterm election.
   ``What we have set as a goal is to be significantly better than
the average result in an off-year election,'' said Sununu. ``And if
we do that, it will be a success.'' That average is generally about
two dozen House seats.
   But success in the 1990 election is more likely to be judged by
which party strengthens its role in redrawing political lines to
conform to the 1990 Census.
   Governors play a crucial role in that battle, particularly in
California, Florida, and Texas, which will pick up 14 new House
seats in the 1992 elections. All three states now have Republican
governors and Democratic legislatures.
   In California, Feinstein campaigned Sunday at church in a black
neighborhood in San Francisco and said Wilson's vote to sustain
Bush's veto ``broke the back of the 1990 Civil Rights bill.''
   The GOP senator told supporters in Bakersfield that Feinstein
ads portraying him as supporting the rich were part of a ``campaign
that depends upon dividing California, dividing the cities against
the rural areas, the rich against the poor and the black against
the white.''

<HEAD>NASA Aiming for Atlantis Launch Next Week</HEAD>

   NASA expects to launch Atlantis with
a spy satellite around Nov. 16, a week later than planned because
of cargo problems, officials said Monday.
   The Air Force has not yet announced a date for the shuttle's
secret military mission. But Forrest McCartney, director of Kennedy
Space Center, said ``the best guess'' is that Atlantis will be
launched at the end of next week.
   Air Force officials last week delayed the Nov. 9 launch, saying
more time was needed ``to resolve anomalies discovered during cargo
testing.'' They refused to elaborate.
   The satellite inside Atlantis reportedly will spy on Iraqi
forces.
   NASA still plans to launch Columbia in early December, despite
Atlantis' delay, McCartney said. Although the space agency likes to
have at least three weeks between flights, it will expedite work in
this case so Columbia's long astronomy mission can be completed by
Christmas, he said.
   ``We're going to cut that time as short as we can,'' he said,
referring to the period between missions. ``But we will not cut
down on the normal inspections and data that we look at.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration would prefer
not to fly any shuttles around Christmas so it can shut down
certain operations at Kennedy Space Center to perform maintenance,
McCar) - President Bush, stumping for GOP candidates
in the final hours before Tuesday's elections, told voters today to
ignore analysts ``telling us everything that's wrong with the
United States'' and go vote ``to make a difference.''
   ``I urge all Texans ... to get out there and vote and do not
take democracy for granted,'' Bush said as traveled his home state.
Bush wrapped up the campaign season trying to energize campaign
workers in Texas and spur voters to the polls for an election
looming with uncertainty for the Republican Party.
   ``You have a chance to make a difference,'' he said as he
campaigned in East Texas with gubernatorial candidate Clayton
Williams and Sen. Phil Gramm.
   ``The cynics, these Washington pundits that we see on these
tiring shows all the time ... I see all these great
`inside-the-beltway' experts telling us everything that's wrong
with the United States.
   ``Tomorrow you can go to the polls and say what's right about
it,'' Bush said to cheers at a Tyler Junior College flag-waving
rally.
   Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the
president would sign later today the $492-billion five-year deficit
reduction package passed by Congress in the final days of its
session.
   The measure, which includes over $140 billion in new taxes, has
created political problems for Bush as he campaigns for Republican
candidates after abandoning his ``no new taxes'' pledges.
   Fitzwater said that the president would also sign 13 spending
bills to finance the government throughout the fiscal year that
began last Oct. 1. Fitzwater said that the 14 pieces of legislation
were being flown to Texas on a commercial airliner and that the
president would sign them later tonight in Houston.
   Bush campaigned with Williams today in Tyler, a hotly-contested
North Texas community of conservative Democrats. Voters in the
agriculture-and timber-dependent area supported Bush in the 1988
presidential election, but bot Democrat Ann Richards and Williams
are hoping to win the area on Tuesday.
   From Tyler, Bush was heading to Richards' home town of Waco to
try and pull support for Williams in the central Texas,
conservative Baptist stronghold.
   Bush continued to keep his message upbeat, after saying Monday
that people should ignore ``all these gloomy assessments'' about
the national mood and just go vote.
   On Sunday, Williams went to church and a campaign phone bank
with Bush, then defended his failure to pay income taxes in 1986.
   ``I was fighting for my life in 1986. I didn't pay any tax
because I didn't have any income'' due to the economic downturn in
Texas from plunging oil prices at that time, he told reporters.
   Bush and Williams made voter-turnout calls to registered
Republicans on a list at a local GOP phone bank.
   The president accepted a reporter's dare to call a name picked
at random from the phone book. It turned out to be Democratic voter
Mary Johnson.
   While reporters watched, hearing his end of the conversation but
not hers, Bush told her he hoped she would vote for the GOP ticket.
   ``Will ya?'' he asked in apparent delight at her response.
   But the woman later said in a telephone interview that she would
vote for Richards, not Williams, ``because I'm not a Republican.''
   ``I just told him I was going to vote,'' she said. ``I didn't
tell him who I was going to vote for.''
   The president also sought by telephone Sunday to boost
Republican efforts in other states.
   Bush gave telephone pep talks to rallies held by Senate hopeful
Hal Daub in Nebraska, congressional candidates Genevieve Atwood in
Utah and Wayne Gilcrest in Maryland, and gubernatorial contenders
Arlis Sturgulewski in Alaska and Kay Orr in Nebraska.
   Bush urged his listeners to ``get out and vote'' on Tuesday. He
told the Alaskans, ``I get sick and tired of all these gloomy
assessments that I hear on television and read about in the
papers.''
   ``We have a lot to be grateful for in our country, and one of
the things is individuals can make a difference.''
   He bemoaned ``this cynical reporting we hear about, how
everybody is gloomy and down in the dumps - I don't believe it.
Alaskans have never been that way.''
   The president's campaign focus has been upbeat in the face of
uncertainties that could spell trouble on Election Day - including
a grim economic picture, skyrocketing gas prices tied to the
Persian Gulf crisis, the promised higher taxes from the new budget
package and the uncertainty over whether war will break out in the
gulf region.
   Bush kept his remarks short and enthusiastic Sunday, staying
clear of controversial issues like his support of the tax-raising
budget package.
   While accusing Democrats of trying to tax working people and
ruining his tough-on-crime legislation, he has curtailed the harsh
rhetoric he unleashed last week.
   His chief of staff, John Sununu, meanwhile, disputed suggestions
that Bush's heightened focus on the gulf last week was a political
tactic to get the focus off the budget and economic issues.
   ``The most important item on his agenda right now is the
situation in the gulf. He was talking about that. He held an open
news conference, and 97 percent of the questions from the press was
on the situation in the Middle East,'' Sununu said on NBC-TV's ``
Meet The Press.''

   Craig Shergold, 11, also is visiting Sea World, Universal
Studios Florida and other sites with his family.
   The London boy had an operation in January 1989 that removed
most of a brain tumor. Craig developed a plan to earn a place in
the Guinness Book of World Records by getting more get-well cards
than anyone had ever received.
   Helped by friends and a Children's Wish Foundation in Atlanta,
Craig received more than 16 million cards from all over the world.
   Craig's mother, Marion, has asked that no more cards be sent.
She said doctors believe chemotherapy and radiation have stemmed
the spread of his cancer.
   Craig will be in the 1991 edition of the record book.

   The U.S. secretary of state met today with the exiled emir of
Kuwait, and there were indications that Iraq was moving to further
pressure the United States and Britain by allowing hostages to call
home.
   Also today, the USS Midway entered the Persian Gulf, the second
U.S. aircraft carrier to do so in four weeks. Like the USS
Independence, which left the gulf last month after a few days, the
Midway's presence was apparently intended as a show of force.
   The British Foreign Office said today at least 30 British
hostages held in Iraq called their families in Britain during the
weekend. The Foreign Office condemned the calls as another ``cruel
and calculating Iraqi ploy.''
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said at least 21 families in the United States receivedtelephone
calls from relatives being detained in Iraq.
   ``Consistent with other reports we have received, many detainees
said they were losing weight, that the food was poor and that with
the approach of winter they were frequently cold,'' Boucher said.
   He added, ``We think if he (Saddam Hussein) is genuinely
concerned about allowing husbands and fathers to talk to their
wives and children, he should simply release all the hostages and
let them come home.''
   Boucher said some hostages expressed concern that the medication
they were using was running out and that mail being sent by
relatives was not being forwarded by Iraqi authorities.
   Hundreds of foreigners have been held in Iraq and Kuwait since
Saddam's troops overran the emirate on Aug. 2. Saddam has offered
to let relatives visit during the Christmas holidays - an offer
reiterated in weekend phone calls by some hostages.
   Other hostages told their families not to give in.
   ``He said the telephone call was being recorded but he didn't
give two mokkeys and to let the government know that the hostages
want no negotiations with the terrorists and they are 100 percent
behind them,'' one Briton said of his hostage son. British
officials did not identify the father and son by name.
   In Brockton, Mass., however, a 44-year-old woman whose twin
brother is a hostage said she'll go to Baghdad for Christmas,
despite the opposition of the U.S. government.
   ``If this helps John's morale, so be it,'' Mary Trundy said of
her twin, John Stevenson.
   She said her twin called their brothers in Florida during the
weekend.
   ``I think it is a very positive sign that they are letting
hostages call home,'' she said. ``We're all planning to spend the
holidays with John.''
   Meanwhile, a British lawmaker said families of the hostages
should stop complaining.
   ``I am sick and tired of the mewling and puking of the relatives
of hostages in the gulf and of some of the hostages themselves,''
said Sir John Stokes. ``During the last war we never heard sobs of
widows. Cannot these people keep a stiff upper lip and think of the
country as a whole?''
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt was headed for
Baghdad today on a controversial mission to win the release of
German hostages. And Yasuhiro Nakasone, the former Japanese prime
minister, sought the release of Japanese hostages in a meeting with
Saddam on Sunday.
   Belgium's foreign minister complained that efforts by individual
nations to win their citizens' freedom are eroding unity against
Iraq. ``Saddam is creating this royal court of all sorts of Western
pilgrims who visit him to obtain the release of hostages,'' the
minister, Mark Eyskens, said in Brussels.
   Italy called a meeting of European Community foreign ministers
in Rome tonight to consider the continuing breaks with the EC
policy opposing negotiations with Iraq over freeing the hostages.
   In the Saudi resort town of Taif today, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III met with Kuwait's exiled emir.
   After the meeting, Baker said: ``This crisis is entering a new
phase, and while we are still seeking a peaceful political and
diplomatic solution, we have to put ourselves in a position where
we would be able to exercise any options that might be available.''
   Baker said he had not discussed a military timetable with the
emir. He said ``the entire international community'' was seeking a
peaceful solution to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, adding: ``I don't
think that we can or should we rule out resort to force if that
should be necessary,''
   Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah said he would like to see his
country liberated ``today and before tomorrow.''
   ``What I would like to see is the liberation of Kuwait as soon
as possible,'' he told reporters.
   Baker was received warmly in the Saudi Arabian desert on Sunday,
but some soldiers expressed frustration.
   ``I'm ready to go home,'' one sergeant told reporters. ``I'm
tired of eating this dirt. I'm tired of drinking hot water.''
   The secretary of state told the troops he understood that ``this
is a long way from home,'' but added: ``I think that Americans are
home wherever our principles are. And that's really what this
crisis is all about.''
   Reports have suggested Baker is trying to fix a date for an
attack on Iraq, or determine which allies could be counted on to
join an offensive if the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq
fails to force Saddam out of Kuwait.

   The Supreme Court turned away arguments Monday
that the public has a constitutional right to attend juvenile court
proceedings.
   The court, without comment, rejected a Columbus, Ohio,
newspaper's contention in a nationally publicized child-custody
case that most juvenile court hearings should be open.
   Lawyers for The Columbus Dispatch argued that past rulings
establishing a public right to attend criminal trials even over a
defendant's objections should apply to juvenile court proceedings
as well.
   The Ohio Supreme Court previously rejected that argument, noting
that juvenile hearings ``are usually private'' and their records
confidential.
   The dispute grew out of a ``surrogate mother'' contract in which
Richard and Beverly Reams hired a woman to have a child for them.
   The woman, who was artificially inseminated with sperm from an
unrelated donor, gave birth in early 1985 to Tessa Reams. The
Reamses took custody of Tessa when she was a day old.
   The couple filed for divorce two years later, and both sought
custody of Tessa. The custody issue was not resolved as part of
their divorce,and in 1987 Mrs. Reams, then known as Beverly
Seymour, sued her ex-husband seeking permanent custody of Tessa.
   The child's court-appointed guardian sought to exclude the
public and news media from all hearings on Tessa's future. The
guardian also sought a ``gag order'' under which Ms. Seymour would
be barred from discussing the case with news reporters.
   The presiding juvenile court judge ordered the custody hearings
closed to the public, and issued the gag order against Ms. Seymour.
   A state appeals court blocked enforcement of both orders, ruling
that they unduly interfered with what it called a constitutional
right of public access to juvenile courts.
   But on appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court last June said the appeals
court was wrong.
   After the state Supreme Court's ruling, the custody hearing over
Tessa was conducted in secret last August. Custody was awarded to
Richard Reams.
   When Reams went to his ex-wife's home in Ashville, Ohio, a week
later to pick up Tessa, he was fatally shot. Ms. Seymour has been
charged with his murder.
   The custody issue continued after Reams was killed. Both the
woman who bore Tessa, Norma Lee Stotski, and Ms. Seymour's sister,
Christine Clay, sought custody.
   County officials, awarded custody by the presiding judge, last
month placed Tessa in the home of Annabelle Reams, Richard Reams'
mother. The county said Tessa recognized her as her grandmother,
even though there were no biological ties.
   After Reams was shot, The Columbus Dispatch was given the record
of the August custody hearing.
   But lawyers for the newspaper said the legal dispute is not moot
because it could arise in another case.

   A South Korean farm official tried to kill himself
at the headquarters of the world's main free-trade association
Monday, apparently to protest attempts to open his country's market
to imports, officials said.
   The man pulled out a Swiss army knife and plunged it into his
stomach as he was about to leave the building on Lake Geneva where
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is based, the officials
said.
   He was rushed to a hospital for emergency treatment and his life
was out of immediate danger, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The man was identified as Kyung-Hae Lee, president of the Korean
National Future Farmer's and Fisherman's Association, one of the
country's main farming lobby groups. He was part of a five-member
delegation visiting GATT to highlight the problems of South Korean
farmers.
   GATT, a 100-nation trade forum, is in the final stages of
four-year negotiations to liberalize world trade.
   The talks, which are scheduled to end in early December, have
prompted demonstrations in South Korea where farmers fear increased
competition from imports, particularly in the sensitive rice
market.

<TEXT>
   A London High Court judge on Monday rejected an
Iraqi government challenge seeking to overturn the seizure of eight
steel tubes allegedly destined for a ``supergun.''
   Judge Michael Nolan refused to consider the Iraqi Ministry of
Industries' contention that the Customs and Excise seizure in April
was unlawful. The judge also refused the Iraqi government's
application for return of the tubes.
   The court refused an adjournment request by lawyer Bernard
Cunningham, who represented the Iraqi Ministry.
   Cunningham said his instructions from Baghdad were to seek an
adjournment until the situation in the Middle East was ``clearer''
and communications restored to normal.
   A previous adjournment had already been granted because of the
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
   Nolan said the ``appropriate way'' for the Iraqi Ministry to
challenge the seizure was to contest Customs and Excise proceedings
to validate the seizure, which are scheduled to begin within the
next few weeks.
   Iraq and the manufacturer, Sheffield Forgemasters, have insisted
the tubes were for a petrochemical plant and not a long-range
weapon.

<HEAD>Tina Turner Ends 6-Month Foreign Tour, Taking Year Off From
Performing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock star Tina Turner has ended her 6{-month
``Foreign Affair'' tour that attracted 3 million fans, and says
she's going to take a year off before performing again.
   ``I've always thought this would be the final one, but I must
admit I now have mixed feelings,'' Miss Turner said through her Los
Angeles publicist after Sunday's concert in Rotterdam, Netherlands.
   ``I'm the first woman to fill all these stadiums and the feeling
from all those fans night after night was fantastic. I don't want
to close that door completely,'' said Miss Turner, who turns 52 on
Nov. 26.
   ``I'm going away for about a year and when I'm ready to return I
just hope the fans will want whatever I have to offer.''
   The Grammy Award winner, whose most famous hits include ``Nut
Bush City Limits,'' ``Proud Mary'' and ``River Deep, Mountain
High,'' concluded the tour before an audience of 30,000 packing
Ahoy sports hall.
   Miss Turner, whose real name is Anna Mae Bullock, became famous
in the mid-1960s in a duo with her then-husband, Ike Turner.
   Her tour began in April in Belgium and continued for 121
performances in 19 countries. More than 120,000 people, including
Britain's Princess Diana, attended a concert at Woburn Abbey, a
15th century manor outside London.
   ``She will take an extended time off, but it is safe to say she
will perform again,'' said her Los Angeles publicist, Maureen
O'Connor.
   The tour helped push sales of Miss Turner's Capitol Records
album ``Foreign Affair'' to more than 5.5 million copies, said
O'Connor.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Would-be beauty queens may not swim with
captive dolphins, except possibly at four designated aquariums, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday.
   NOAA said the Marinelife Oceanarium in Gulfport, Miss., was
issued a written warning because it allowed several contestants
from the Miss Teen U.S.A. contest to swim with its dolphins on July
2.
   William W. Fox Jr., assistant administrator of NOAA's National
Marine Fisheries Service, said in a statement that similar
violations could bring fines or loss of permits allowing the
display of captive animals.
   Marinelife's curator, Moby Solangi, issued a statement saying
the fisheries service wasted taxpayers' money by investigating the
Miss Teen U.S.A. affair.
   ``It is clear they are responding to emotionalism of animal
rights extremists,'' he said, adding that he did not believe
Marinelife had violated any regulations.
   Miss Teen U.S.A. contestants joined the dolphins for the filming
of a segment that was to be shown during the pageant's broadcast.
After the investigation was announced, pageant officials dropped
the dolphin segment.
   Ronnie Salters, a leader of Citizens for Marine Mammal
Protection, called the warning ``a fair decision.''
   ``We didn't really expect them to give any fine or anything like
that,'' he said.
   Programs in which tourists are invited to swim with dolphins
have been criticized as possibly harmful to both the dolphins and
the people.
   Only four facilities in the United States, not including
Marinelife, have permits allowing swim-with-the-dolphin programs.
   Even at those four aquariums, provisions were tightened in a
ruling this summer to protect the dolphins and to warn the public
of the risks of injury, the NOAA announcement said.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Bail to IRA Member</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today declined to set bail for
Joseph Doherty, the Irish revoltionary who has been jailed in New
York for more than seven years.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum ruled that Doherty would
likely flee if his release were approved.
   ``The evidence is overwhelming that petitioner, if released,
would pose such a substantial risk of flight that no condition of
bail could reasonably assure his surrender for deportation,''
Cedarbaum said in a 23-page decision.
   Doherty, 35, faces alife sentence in the United Kingdom for the
murder of a British officer killed in a gunfight between British
troops and Doherty's four-man IRA unit.
   He escaped from a prison in Northern Ireland in 1981 and came to
the United States a year later. He was arrested in New York in 1983
and has been imprisoned in a Manhattan jail since then.
   Doherty has never been charged with a crime in the United
States; he's been held without bail the entire time.
   A call to his attorneys was not immediately returned today.
   Doherty's request for bail was made in the form of a writ of
habeus corpus, which claimed his constitutional right to due
process was violated by his lengthy imprisonment.
   He had sought release on bail while continuing efforts to fight
deportation and gain political asylum in the United States.
   While conceding that the length of his detention was ``extremely
troubling,'' the judge rejected the argument that Doherty's
constitutional rights were violated.
   She noted that many of the constitutional protections given
people accused of crimes did not apply to aliens in deportation
proceedings.
   She also ruled that the U.S. government was not responsible for
delaying his deportation proceedings. ``To the contrary, his own
strategic maneuvers have caused significant delays,'' Cedarbaum
said.
   She said Doherty's continued detention ``continues to serve the
valid regulatory purpose of keeping him available for
deportation.''
   Cedarbaum's ruling followed a hearing, held over several days in
September and October, during which Doherty testified that he was
no longer a member of the IRA.
   He had promised the judge that he would abide by any conditions
of bail and would willingly return to the United Kingdom if he lost
his bid for asylum.
   The U.S. government, which opposed Doherty's release, called as
a witness an expert on terrorism, who testified that IRA membership
was a ``cradle to grave'' proposition.
   The almost exclusively Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to push
the British out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it
with the Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist
state.

   Black students demanding a
boycott of final exams to protest school conditions clashed with
pupils who wanted to take the tests, leaving up to 19 people dead,
police said Monday.
   Ten more blacks were killed in other township violence,
including eight apparently caught in a feud between competing taxi
companies, police reported.
   The student violence in Bekkersdal, outside Johannesburg, began
Thursday and lasted through the weekend. It was unclear if all 19
deaths were the result of student clashes, but police Capt. Eugene
Opperman said he believed most were.
   According to police, students opposed to the year-end exams had
been trying to prevent other students from taking the standardized
tests, which determine whether students may proceed onto the next
grade or gain admission to universities.
   Last year, less than half of the black students passed the
tests, compared with a pass rate of more than 90 percent for white
students.
   The white-led government spends five times as much to educate a
white pupil as a black pupil in South Africa, and anti-apartheid
activists have complained for years about problems in the black
schools.
   Opperman said not all the people involved in the Bekkersdal
clashes were students. He said one body was found Monday, but it
was unclear when the person died. He also did not know when the
other 18 deaths occurred.
   Police used tear gas Monday to disperse stone-throwers, Opperman
said. There were reports of arson, and one youth was seriously
wounded in a stabbing, police Capt. Henriette Bester said.
   Also Monday, police said eight people died when men in vans
randomly stabbed and shot people Sunday in the township of
Kutloanong, 140 miles southwest of Johannesburg.
   They were believed to have been victims of a feud between taxi
companies that began fighting each other last week in Kutloanong.
Before Sunday's attacks, three people had died in the taxi war.
   There are an estimated 100,000 privately owned taxi-vans
operating in black areas nationwide, and violent disputes over
routes and passengers occur regularly.
   Also, the daily police unrest report said one man died in the
township of Alexandra, outside Johannesburg. Another man was
stabbed to death in Mganga Baboyi, a township in the eastern
province of Natal, the unrest report added. It did not say when
those deaths occurred.
   More than 5,000 people have died in Natal since 1986 in fighting
between supporters of the African National Congress and the Inkatha
Freedom Party. Both groups oppose apartheid but disagree on tactics
to fight it and on their view of a future South Africa.
   Factional fighting involving university students broke out over
the weekend in the Johannesburg township of Soweto, and one man was
critically injured, officials said. The fighting involved students
from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and
occurred at a Soweto dormitory used by the university.

<HEAD>Joint European Pledge to Stabilize Carbon Dioxide Emissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen European nations on Monday agreed to keep
carbon dioxide emissions in their nations at 1990 levels to curb
the threat of global warming. They also pledged to urge other
countries to follow suit.
   But the draft of a ministerial declaration that will conclude a
10-day U.N. conference on global warming indicated that
Washington's slower approach to controlling emissions is likely to
prevail in the final document Wednesday.
   The United States has argued that in view of the great cost of
limiting greenhouse gas emissions, more research is needed before
drastic measures are taken.
   The target of limiting carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels
by the year 2,000 was set at a joint meeting of the environment
ministers of the 12-nation European Community and six-nation
European Free Trade Association.
   A joint statement invited ``all industralized nations to take
similar action.''
   Scientists have identified carbon dioxide as the main
contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect, induced by
heat-trapping gases. Other greenhouse gases are methane, nitrous
oxide and chlorofluorocarbons.
   Industrialized nations contribute three-quarters of all man-made
greenhouse gases.
   Carlo Ripa de Meana, the EC environment commissioner, said the
accord strengthened the European position at the conference,
attended by about 700 scientists from about 100 nations.
   Ministers from more than 80 countries, including several heads
of government, are expected at the two-day windup of the U.N.
conference. The session will set the stage for formal negotiations
in Washington next February on an international treaty on global
warming.
   ``Europeans are leading in this battle,'' Ripa de Meana said.
``The question of how to persuade the United States and the Soviet
Union will be a central task of this conference.''
   But environmental groups attending the conference said the
Europeans already had backed away from earlier proposals.
   Jeremy Leggett of Greenpeace Britain said he thought some
governments would strip the final document of any targets. He said
the United States, the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia were the
principal opponents to swift action.
   The 30-point draft declaration circulated Monday avoids setting
targets and makes no firm commitments toward reducing the
greenhouse effect. Scientists at the conference have said immediate
action is needed.
   The draft declaration said that over the past decade a ``clear
scientific consensus has emerged'' on global warming expected to
occur in the next century.
   In a paper approved unanimously on Saturday, scientists agreed
that by the year 2005 many industrialized nations would be able to
cut their output of carbon dioxide by at least 20 percent.
   A preliminary EC text had initially proposed that the
ministerial declaration, to be issued at the close of the
conference on Wednesday, should set targets for industrialized
countries to stabilize emissions.
   The latest draft ``welcomes'' the European accord on carbon
dioxide stabilization but omits any reference to targets for other
countries.
   Other developed countries are urged ``to establish targets
and-or feasible national programs or strategies which will have
significant effects on limiting emissions.''
   ``This waffle lets the United States off the hook,'' said
Steward Boyle of the Climate Action Network, another environmental
group. ``It means 18 months of doing nothing. Needless to say, the
United States is delighted.''
   The international treaty on global warming will be signed in
mid-1992 at a conference in Rio de Janeiro.

<HEAD>Hospitals Turn Away Patients Because of Doctor Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government hospitals turned away
patients Monday as 10,000 doctors went on strike to protest the
government health policy.
   Only critical cases were being treated during the 24-hour
strike, said Mostafa Jll Mohiuddin, of the Bangladesh Medical
Association. But an indefinite strike may be called if the
government ignores the protest, he said.
   The doctors want government supporters to quit the eight-member
committee set up by President Hussain Muhammad Ershad to forumalte
health policy.
   The committee was appointed after a two-month strike that
doctors called earlier this year when the government tried to ban
private practice.
   In a separate anti-government action, about 3,000 people
demonstrated outside the radio and television centers against what
they called government propaganda on the state-run media.
   The protests were part of an ongoing campaign to pressure Ershad
to resign and to hold free elections.
   One demonstration by 1,500 protesters at the radio center was
led by Sheik Hasina, head of the Awami League and one of two main
opposition politicians.
   The other opposition figure, Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, led about 1,000 people in a demonstration at a
television center on the outskirts of Dhaka. About 500 people
joined separate protests.
   Ershad seized power in a bloodless military coup in 1982. The
opposition says three elections since then were rigged to keep him
in office.
   The opposition campaign began in earnest in November 1987 and
flares up periodically. The campaign was renewed in mid-October,
when eight people were killed by police during demonstrations.
   There are no private radio or television stations in Bangladesh.

   The Reverend Jesse Jackson urged Iraq's
ambassador Monday to persuade his government to provide food,
electricity and water to the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   Jackson, who visited Iraq in August shortly after the country
invaded Kuwait, said the Iraqis could improve the diplomatic
climate by resupplying the American embassy in Kuwait.
   ``It would cost you little and gain a great deal if you were to
allow basic supplies and amenities such as water and electricity to
the people in those restricted quarters,'' Jackson said in a letter
he sent to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein earlier this month.
   Jackson reiterated his request in a 20-minute meeting with Iraqi
Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat during which he also asked the Iraqis
to arrange an airlift so that American hostages in Iraq and Kuwait
could be home by Christmas.
   Al-Mashat told reporters after the meeting that he had relayed
Jackson's message to Baghdad. He also repeated Iraq's pledge that
it will release all foreign hostages if the U.N. Security Council
or two of five nations - France, the Soviet Union, China, Germany
and Japan - guarantee there will be no attack on Iraq.
   To bolster his plea, Jackson said his group, The National
Rainbow Coalition, would circulate a petition seeking to have Iraq
send supplies to the embassy.
   Eight diplomats and 19 other Americans are trapped at the
embassy in Kuwait, where conditions are said to be deteriorating
rapidly.
   ``The lights are off. All refrigerators are off... water is
off'' and supplies are quickly running out, Jackson said. The
Americans are digging trenches to use as latrines, he said.
   Jackson echoed the U.S. position that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait
and restore that country's sovereign leaders.
   But he said it was his impression that the Iraqis might be
inclined to seek a diplomatic solution if both sides could tone
down their rhetoric.
   ``Maximum rhetoric begets maximum rhetoric,'' Jackson said,
referring to the tough line recently taken by President Bush and
his secretary of state James A. Baker III.

   Police arrested 150 people for spreading
rumors that sorcerers have been stealing men's genitals - rumors
that led to at least three deaths, police said Monday.
   Deputy Police Commissioner James Danbaba announced the arrests
after rumors about the purported thefts swept the West African
capital.
   Mobs killed at least three people accused of stealing the
organs. One policewoman who rushed to the aid of an alleged
sorcerer was beaten by the crowd and remained in a coma Monday.
   According to the rumors, the alleged sorcerers approached
strangers and asked them for directions. Later, the victims
reportedly said their genitals were missing.
   Police dismissed the reports after investigators examined the
supposed victims, Danbaba said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet satellite pictures have confirmed that an
industrial operation is in place in northern Iraq, where Kurdish
opposition groups have reported seeing a uranium mine, Jane's
Defense Weekly said Monday.
   The respected defense industry magazine said the satellite
photos, taken shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, picked out
new road systems built in the Gara mountains, 40 miles south of the
Turkish border.
   John Moore, a mineralogist from Imperial College, said the
photos showed signs of possible excavations at two sites, the
report said.
   Experts from the National Imagery Center near Cambridge picked
out a 2,500-foot long building at the site, Jane's Defense Weekly
said. Those experts suggested three possible uses: chemical weapons
production, a conventional weapons site, or a nuclear-related site.
   There are four Iraqi military bases nearby in the rugged
territory, the report said.
   Jane's said the Kurdistan Democratic Party has claimed its
agents penetrated the security around the site this year, and found
two sites were being developed.
   Hoshyar Zebari, the party's European representative, told Jane's
one site was a uranium mine. Nearby, he said, a huge tunnel was
being dug but its purpose was unknown.
   Iraq is believed to be working to develop nuclear weapons. In
1981, Israeli jets attacked an Iraqi nuclear reactor which was
thought to be part of a weapons program. Earlier this year, British
customs agents seized electronic components, which could be used in
nuclear bomb triggers, before they could be put aboard an Iraqi
Airways flight from London.

<HEAD>Another Death Reported in Moldavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A policeman has died of injuries suffered in last
week's ethnic clashes in Moldavia, bringing the death toll to at
least four, it was reported Monday.
   The independent Interfax news agency said the policeman, who was
Moldavian, died in a hospital near the city of Dubossary, the site
of Friday's clash between Moldavian Interior Ministry troops and
Russian and Ukrainian separatists.
   According to the Moldavian Interior Ministry, three people were
killed Friday and nine suffered gunshot wounds in the republic's
eastern Dniester region, where about 200,000 Russians and
Ukrainians live. The Tass news agency had reported Saturday that
six people were killed and 30 injured.
   Before Monday's report, all the casualties had been identified
as either Russians or Ukrainians.
   Viktor Pushkashu, vice president of the Moldavian Parliament,
went on radio in the southwestern Soviet republic Monday and
detailed the legislature's call for all volunteer, self-defense
groups to disband and disarm, Tass reported.
   The republic of Moldavia, which has taken steps toward
independence, faces separatist movements in the Dniester region by
Russians and Ukrainians, and by the Gagauz, a Turkish Christian
minority in its southern area. Both the Gagauz and Dniester
separatists claim discrimination by Moldavians.
   Moldavian President Mircha Snegur appealed Sunday for an end to
street demonstrations and urged his parliament to reconsider laws
that have stirred unrest in the republic.
   A law that made Moldavian the national language has caused
resentment among Russian speakers and the Gagauz, who speak a
Turkic tongue. Moldavian - identical to Romanian, except for the
Cyrillic characters imposed on the republic under Stalin's reign -
is spoken by two-thirds of the 4.3 million people in the republic
that borders Romania.
   A funeral rally to mourn the dead from Friday's unrest was
scheduled for Tuesday in the Dniester region despite Snegur's
appeal for an end to public demonstrations.
   Pushkashu appealed for a cooling of passions in Moldavia.
   ``It is necessary to make people return to work, as many of them
have recently been diverted from their daily business,'' Pushkashu
was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Former Contras Pressure Government For Aid With Hunger Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Contra rebels staging a hunger
strike in a Managua church have joined others protesting that the
government has reneged on promises of aid to the demobilized
anti-Sandinista guerrillas.
   About 200 former Contras blocked the Rama Road - the only
overland route into southeastern Nicaragua - for the sixth day,
cutting off a chunk of the region from the rest of the country.
   The church occupation, which began Sunday, was the latest action
by the former rebels to pressure President Violeta Chamorro's
government into coming through with programs designed to help the
fighters rejoin civilian life.
   Other recent Contra actions included looting government
warehouses in the Atlantic Coast town of Puerto Cabezas, a shootout
with police in northern Waslala, and taking over the Sandinista
Front headquarters in northern Quilali.
   ``In the same way that they (the government) pressured us to
disarm, we're pressuring them to give us answers to our problems,''
said former rebel William Castellon, one of seven men occupying the
Santo Domingo Church.
   Castellon said he was political adviser to the disbanded
Democratic Revolutionary Alliance, which fought on Nicaragua's
southern front and was directed by dissident Nicaraguans based in
Costa Rica.
   Hunger strikers allowed some reporters into the church.
   Lt. Consuelo Solorzano, a spokeswoman at the Interior Ministry,
said police had not tried to dislodge the dissidents because church
officials have not requested help.
   But police patrolled the neighborhood on the outskirts of
Managua.
   The former guerrillas say the government has failed to hand over
promised land, food, medicines and building materials.
   About 20,000 Contras finished disarming in June after Mrs.
Chamorro and her 14-party coalition defeated the Sandinistas in
Feb. 25 elections. They were promised aid in exchange for turning
in their weapons.
   ``Violence still is a risk to democracy in Nicaragua,'' Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of Managua, said in his
sermon Sunday at his Santo Domingo Church just before the Contras
occupied it.
   Obando said: ``The government must make an effort to speed up
fulfillment of its promises.''
   After the Mass ended, seven men walked into the church and
declared themselves on a hunger strike.
   ``Carlos Hurtado, assassin of peasants in Yolaina,'' read a
hand-written poster that hunger strikers tacked to the closed
church doors.
   Hurtado is minister of the interior, the department that
controls police.
   One person died and 14 were wounded in the south-central village
of Yolaina last week when police and soldiers, still controlled by
the Sandinistas, opened fire during a protest march.
   Castellon said the former rebels also wanted Mrs. Chamorro's
government to disband the Sandinista police and army.
   The Contras resent having had to demobilize while the Sandinista
police and Sandinista Peoples Army remain the official law
enforcement and military forces in Nicaragua.
   That resentment is compounded because Mrs. Chamorro's pro-U.S.
government allows both forces to retain the name of the leftist
Sandinista Front, the Contras' enemy during nine years of guerrilla
war.
   Two weeks ago the Interior Ministry, responding to Contra
pressure, ordered that authority in Rio Blanco in north-central
Nicaragua, be turned over to the Rural Police, a government force
made up of demobilized Contras.
   The Contra blockade of the Rama Road, which is also the only
overland route into the Atlantic Coast town of Bluefields, began
Wednesday. Protestors there are demanding land and the withdrawal
of Sandinista Police from the region.

<HEAD>Sixth Person People Arrested in Halloween Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sixth young man was arrested Monday and
charged with murder in a Halloween ``thrill'' rampage that left one
homeless man dead and nine others injured on Ward's Island.
   Five of the defendants - one only 13, one 15 and one 16 - were
arrested Sunday on murder charges in the death of Carlos Melendez,
whose throat was slashed.
   More arrests are expected, according to police spokeswoman Sgt.
Tina Mohrmann.
   The attack was the latest in a series of vicious gang attacks in
the city, including the 1989 attack on a jogger in Central Park and
the slaying of a Utah tourist during a subway mugging this summer.
   About a dozen youths, some wearing Halloween masks, screamed
``Trick or Treat'' during last Wednesday's attack on homeless men
heading to a shelter on the East River island. Police said the
youths were armed with bats, pipes, knives and meat cleavers.
   Police said the group apparently attacked the homeless men for
thrills.
   Melendez, 35, died at the scene. Three other men required from
30 to 55 stitches to close head cuts.
   Detectives followed up on information from several sources,
including anonymous tips, to arrest the six, said Mohrmann.
   Charged with murder were Robert Sherman, 23, of the Bronx, and
four East Harlem residents: Hector Torres, 15, Aaron Ware, 13, and
his brother Raymond Fenner, 22, and John Moreno, 16. Moreno was
arrested Monday.
   An 18-year-old, Eric Williams, was charged with attempted murder
in the attack on Roosevelt Jones, who was beaten about the face
with a pipe, Mohrmann said.
   The gang waited in a dark wooded area and attacked the men as
they walked over a narrow footbridge that connects East Harlem to a
men's shelter on the island.
   The attack began at 9:15 p.m. and ended shortly before the
footbridge closed at 10 p.m.
   ``It was Halloween, the homeless are there, they're an easy
target,'' Capt. Daniel McKenna of Manhattan detectives said last
week.

   The United States and Venezuela signed an
agreement on Monday to exchange financial information in a joint
effort to fight illicit drug trafficking and money laundering.
   Under the agreement, both countries will exchange currency
transaction information recorded by their financial institutions
beginning Jan. 1.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who signed the pact for
the United States, called it ``another significant step in the
effort to track illegal profits around the world and put criminals
behind bars.''
   ``By developing a network of countries committed to identifying
the profits of narcotics trafficking, we can begin to deprive
traffickers of their financial lifeline and dismantle their
criminal organizations,'' he said.
  Signing the agreement for Venezuela were Finance Minister

   King Hussein of Jordan warned that ``no one will
leave a winner'' from a war in the Persian Gulf and said Monday he
fears armed conflict might be imminent.
   The Jordanian monarch made his remarks during an interview with
Radio France International before meeting lwith President Francois
Mitterrand.
   The king told RFI that nations contributing to the multinational
force in the gulf are beginning to rethink the possibility of war
in the world's largest oil-producing region. He named no specific
nations.
   Asked if he thought war was imminent, Hussein responded: ``If
it's going to happen, it will be very imminent. But I don't wish
it.''
   ``If we look at the situation on the ground, there exists the
possibility of an incident happening, either by accident or on
purpose,'' Hussein said.
   Jordan would suffer enormously in a war and already is affected
by the U.N. embargo against Iraq, his country's largest trading
partner, Hussein said. The embargo was imposed after Iraqi troops
occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Hussein described his talks with Mitterrand as positive and
underscored what he called ``common efforts'' by France and Jordan
to find a peaceful solution to the Middle East's problems.
   Hussein urged an Arab solution to the crisis, something
Mitterrand has said offers little chance of success, presidential
spokesman Hubert Vedrine said.
   France has urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict but
insists Iraq comply with U.N. resolutions demanding that Saddam
Hussein free all foreign hostages and withdraw his troops from
Kuwait.

   The recommendations, said Health Secretary Louis Sullivan, are
also more specific than guidelines issued in 1980 and 1985.
   The new ones ``include more positive advice, oriented to the
total diet, with clear wording and specific numbers,'' he said.
   For example, the 27-page booklet of guidelines being distributed
by the government says Americans should get 30 percent or less of
their calories from fat, with only 10 percent of that from animal
fat and tropical oils.
   Other guidelines:
   -Eat two or three servings daily of meat, poultry, fish, dry
beans or eggs. But no more than 6 ounces a day.
   -Trim fat from meat. Remove the skin from poultry and have
cooked dry beans and peas instead of meat occasionally.
   -Have two or three servings of milk and dairy products daily. A
serving is one cup of milk or yogurt or about 1{ ounces of cheese.
   -Have three or more servings of vegetables daily, eating
dark-green, leafy and deep-yellow vegetables, dry beans and peas
often. Also eat starchy vegetables, such as potatoes and corn.
   -Eat two or more servings of fruit, such as one medium apple, an
orange or a banana, daily.
   -Use sugar and salt in moderation.
   -If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.
   The guidelines define moderation in drinking alcoholic beverages
as one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks a day
for men. One drink means 12 ounces of regular beer, five ounces of
wine or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, 80 proof.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the new guidelines
would influence the national school lunch program run by USDA and
the Women Infant and Children program, which provides food,
vouchers for food and nutritional information to poor, pregnant
women, nursing mothers and their babies.
   ``We reach a large segment of the public with our food
programs,'' said Yeutter, who released the guidelines at a press
conference with Sullivan.
   ``As children begin to eat with the family, usually at about 2
years of age, they should be encouraged to choose diets that are
lower in fat and saturated fat and that provide the calories and
nutrients they need for normal growth,'' says the pamphlet.
   What's revolutionary in the new recommendations, says the
American School Food Service Association, is that the government is
applying the guidelines to children for the first time.
   Anne Gennings, president of the school food service association,
said schools across the country already offer a variety of food
choices lower in fat, sugar and sodium. The report reinforces that
effort, she said.
   But Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy, said the government could do more.
   ``What's important now is not focusing on the guidelines
themselves, but concrete action plans for translating the
guidelines,'' she said, advocating laws or regulations requiring
schools to cut meals to no more than 30 percent fat, for example.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest also was critical,
saying the guidelines were weak and ``devoid of the urgency that
the situation deserves.''
   ``The government's mealy-mouthed advice can hardly be expected
to spur the major overhaul in eating habits that most Americans
should make,'' said Jane Hurley, the non-profit group's associate
nutritionist.
   Food industry organizations, however, were supportive.
   ``The Salt Institute is pleased that the revised Dietary
Guidelines now encourage Americans to `use salt or sodium in
moderation.''' said the trade group, which opposed the words
``avoid salt'' in the 1985 guidelines.
   The American Meat Institute said the guidelines were ``a prudent
road map to healthy, delicious and varied diets'' that ``provide
ample room for all foods from all food groups to be included in
Americans' diets.''
   ``Today's lean, trimmed beef fits well into the kinds of diets
being recommended,'' said the National Cattlemen's Association.

<TEXT>
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt
arrived in this capital Monday night on a personal mission to win
the release of hundreds of Iraqi-held hostages.
   The British government has criticized the effort and Brandt has
been unable to stir up much support outside Germany for the trip.
   The German government says it backs the journey even though the
12-nation European Economic Community last week stated there should
be no negotiations with Baghdad on hostages.
   Brandt, honorary head of the opposition Social Democrats in
Germany, says his trip is a private mission and that he is not
going to Baghdad as a representative of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government.
   In an interview with the Bonn newspaper General Anzeiger, Brandt
said he would ``listen to'' Iraqi President Saddam Hussein but not
negotiate with him.
   Brandt traveled in a chartered Lufthansa Airbus that can carry
about 250 people, bearing flowers and letters from relatives of the
estimated 400 German hostages.
   Brandt is the latest in a line of former government leaders to
visit Iraq on missions to win freedom for hostages, known as
``guests'' in Iraq, and try to find a peaceful solution to the
three-month-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   At the same time, however, he said ``I hope I can help people
held captive there, and not just our own (Germans),'' the newspaper
reported in its Monday editions.
   Also visiting Baghdad is former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone.

   A woman described to a jury Monday
how her father cracked her playmate's skull with a rock 21 years
ago.
   Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, 29, also testified in the murder trial
of her father that he threatened to kill her if she didn't keep
quiet about the bludgeoning of 8-year-old Susan Nason.
   ``I saw hair that was no longer attached. I saw something
whitish. I saw blood,'' Franklin-Lipsker said.
   ``I saw him approaching Susie with his hands up above his head
with a rock. I screamed, I yelled,'' Franklin-Lipsker testified.
``The next thing that I heard was two blows. It sounded terrible.
It sounded like a crack.''
   She said she repressed the memory until last year, when she went
to police after memories flooded back as she looked at her own
daughter, who bears a strong resemblance to the dead girl.
   George Franklin Sr., 51, a former firefighter, was charged with
murder. He pleaded innocent and faces a possible life sentence if
convicted.
   Franklin-Lipsker said Susan crumpled and fell to the ground
after Franklin struck her Sept. 22, 1969. She said she ran to her
father's van, where he grabbed her and knocked her to the ground.
   ``He said `It's over now. You've got to stop this. It's over
now.' ... I was screaming,'' Franklin-Lipsker testified.
   Susan's body was discovered in December 1969 in a ravine off a
highway. A blood-stained rock was nearby.
   Franklin told his daughter she would be blamed if she told
authorities, Franklin-Lipsker testified.
   ``He said, `If you don't stop this, I'll have to kill you,'''
she said. ``I was terrified but I absolutely believed him.''
   Franklin's lawyer, Douglas Horngrad, said Franklin-Lipsker has
told often conflicting versions of the slaying.
   The Franklin family, including a son and three other daughters,
lived in the same neighborhood as the Nasons in Foster City in
1969. Franklin and his wife were divorced in 1977.
   Prosecutor Elaine Tipton said she planned to call more than 40
witnesses, including Franklin's ex-wife and another daughter.

   Cowboy crooner Roy Rogers celebrated
his 79th birthday Monday, finding his happy trail led home after
surgery last month.
   ``He's not up to jumping up and down yet,'' said Roy ``Dusty''
Rogers Jr. His father underwent surgery Oct. 21 to correct an
aneurysm in his aorta, the body's main artery.
   The actor-singer, released Friday from St. Mary Desert Valley
Hospital, is on his feet and able to walk around the house, his son
said. Recovery is expected to take six to eight weeks.
   Rogers starred in 87 Westerns, including 35 with his wife, Dale
Evans. He recently recorded a country-western record album in
Nashville with guest appearances by Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings
and thers.
   During the recording session, 35 artists also joined Rogers in
the studio to sing ``Happy Trails,'' the theme song for Rogers and
Miss Evans, 77.
   Family tradition is to share one cake for three Rogers
birthdays, because of their proximity, Dusty Rogers said. Dusty
Rogers turned 44 on Oct. 28. His mother's birthday was Oct. 31.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to allow
the prosecution of some Puerto Rico cable TV systems that carry The
Playboy Channel, rejecting arguments that states' anti-obscenity
efforts may be hampered unduly.
   The justices, without comment, left intact rulings that such
prosecutions are pre-empted by federal law.
   In a separate case, the court let stand a ruling that lets
prosecutors punish businesses convicted of dealing in obscenity by
seizing their property.
   The court, again without comment, rejected an adult bookstore's
challenge to an Illinois anti-pornography law.
   At issue in the cable TV case was the effect of the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, which imposes mandatory access
obligations on cable operators whose systems have at least 36
active channels.
   The law says such operators must make available, on a
first-come, first-served basis, a certain number of channels for
commercial use by programmers not affiliated with the cable system.
   Once an unaffiliated programmer obtains access, the cable
operator is prohibited from exercising any editorial control over
the programming transmitted on that channel.
   But the federal law also states that cable operators cannot be
held accountable for any libel, obscenity or false advertising
carried on a channel it surrendered under the mandatory access
provisions.
   In the spring of 1987, a prosecutor in Puerto Rico's Department
of Justice notified cable operators that criminal obscenity charges
would be filed against all systems transmitting The Playboy
Channel.
   Within a few months, all cable systems but one - Teleponce Inc.
- had dropped The Playboy Channel, which features so-called adult
entertainment.
   Playboy Enterprises Inc., which through a wholly owned
subsidiary distributed The Playboy Channel, and the Puerto Rico
Cable Television Association, a trade group, then sued the island
commonwealth's Department of Justice.
   The suit, invoking a federal civil rights law, accused Puerto
Rico officials of unlawfully interfering with free-speech rights.
   U.S. District Judge Jaime Pieras Jr. barred authorities from
taking any action against any cable operator carrying The Playboy
Channel under the federal Cable Act's mandatory access provisions.
   The judge said local obscenity prosecutions of such cable
operators were precluded by the federal law.
   The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that
ruling last June.
   In the case acted on today, the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld an Illinois law challenged by Sequoia Books
Inc., owner of the Denmark II bookstore in Kendall County.
   Sequoia Books was convicted of selling obscene materials 12
times between January 1985 and September 1987.
   An Illinois law that took effect Jan. 1, 1989, lets authorities
seize property ``derived from or used to commit obscenity
offenses.'' Any business convicted at least twice of obscenity
violations is subject to forfeiting its property.
   The appeals court said the law may not be applied retroactively
but said Sequoia's property may be seized for any obscenity
violation from 1989 onward.
   The bookstore's owners said the law operates as a prior
restraint on free expression.
   The 7th Circuit court rejected the argument, noting that the
Illinois law is less sweeping than the seizure provisions of a
federal anti-racketeering law that has survived similar challenges.
   Sexually explicit material, often characterized as pornography,
is not necessarily obscene. Obscenity, a legal term, must be
determined in a judicial proceeding.
   Sexually explicit material judged obscene enjoys no free-speech
protection. If the material is not found to be obscene, it is
protected by constitutional free-speech guarantees.

<TEXT>
   The Council of Europe, marking the 40th anniversary
of its human rights charter, declared Monday that it wants the
United States and the Soviet Union to join in some of its
functions.
   The council is the oldest postwar body promoting European
cooperation. On Tuesday it is to admit Hungary as its first member
from the former Communist bloc.
   The 23-nation council issued a statement at the end of a meeting
Monday saying it wanted to help coordinate human rights issues for
the CSCE, or Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. That
organization is a loosely defined body of 34 nations that has been
a forum for talks between Cold War enemies.
   ``For this purpose, it (the Council of Europe) should adjust its
structures and working methods to enable all the states
participating in the CSCE which are not council members, including
Canada, the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., to take part in some of its
intergovernmental and parliamentary activities in the human rights
field on an equal footing,'' the declaration said.
   Earlier Monday, Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis
opened the meeting by calling for the council's assembly to develop
into a parliament bringing together the former Communist bloc and
the West, including the United States.
   A U.S. official said Washington wanted to work with the Council
of Europe in aiding emerging Eastern European democracies.
   But the official - Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of
State for human rights - said the United States was unlikely to
become a member of the Council of Europe.
   ``Joining the Council of Europe would mean that final judgments
of U.S. courts can be reviewed and set aside,'' he said. Such a
situation would require amending the Constitution, he added.
   ``Rather than deal with this aspect of it, there's many things
we can do together,'' he said after Monday's meeting.
   The session brought together council ministers and observers
from Eastern Europe, the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union
and other states.
   They discussed what role the council would have in the post-Cold
War era.
   The Council of Europe is hoping to emerge as a political
counterpart to organizations like NATO, which has stressed military
cooperation, and the European Community, which has focused on
economic cooperation.
   In his speech, De Michelis suggested that the council's Assembly
become the parliament for the CSCE countries.
   ``Only by maintaining the bigger picture involving the North
American democracy, will it be possible to face the question, of
historic dimensions, of the relations between Europe and the Soviet
Union,'' he said.
   However, the United States has raised objections to the plan.
Washington has traditionally been wary of the CSCE because of its
unwieldly size and the fact that the U.S. voice carries only as
much weight as that of the other CSCE participants.
   The Council of Europe's secretary-general, Catherine Lalumiere,
said many speakers Monday suggested using the Council's European
Human Rights Convention as the basis for human-rights accords
regulating the post-Cold War order.
   ``It is essential to start building the Europe of the future on
a sound basis,'' she said.
   The convention is the best-known of the 130 treaties signed by
Council of Europe members.
   It is unique in allowing individuals to sue their governments in
an international court whose decisions are binding.
   Lalumiere said other conclusions reached Monday included the
need to reduce the backlog of such human-rights cases. There was
also a need to give fresh impulse to the European Social Charter,
which focuses on social and economic rights, she said.
   The Council of Europe includes Austria, Belgium, Britain,
Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and
Turkey.

   A hijacked helicopter plucked four
convicts from a prison rooftop Monday and flew them toward the
Spanish border, police said.
   The prisoners, armed with knives, took the keys for the main
cell block from three guards and climbed to the roof, police said.
   They demanded to negotiate with authorities the release of
another prisoner from solitary confinement. Police said the inmates
apparently were stalling for time until the helicopter arrived.
   Police were surrounding the building as the helicopter arrived
and then lowered a rope ladder. The prisoners clambered aboard and
the helicopter headed for the Spanish border, 30 miles away.
   Police said the prisoners appeared to be led by Frederic Boulay,
28, convicted in 1984 of two murders and 17 attempted killings and
sentenced to 20 years in jail. The other prisoners - Gilbert
Ghislain, Jose Dos Santos and Hamid Mamouz - were serving 20-year
terms for murder or armed robbery.
   The helicopter belonged to a company in Toulouse, Heli-Inter. A
spokesman said the pilot, Claud Berschied, took off Monday
afternoon with a woman ``wishing an aerial baptism.''
   Berscheid landed a few hours later to refuel at an airport in
Blagnac, police said. There, he apparently picked up a male
passenger who police believe hijacked the helicopter, forcing the
pilot to head for Lannemezan.
   The helicopter had not been found late Monday.
   Boulay, Ghislain and seven other inmates escaped from the
high-security Lannemezan prison last December, blowing off a
cellblock door with explosives and climbing over a wall with ropes.
All eight were eventually recaptured.

<TEXT>
   Incumbent Sen. Jesse Helms said Monday he
had been forced into running a negative Senate campaign, and
Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt said he had stuck to the high
road.
   ``It has been a spirited debate, albeit a vicious one,'' Helms
told reporters on the final day of campaiging before the election.
He repeated his charges that Gantt has lied about his record.
   ``I regret his tone,'' Helms said. ``We had hoped we could run a
positive campaign, but from the beginning they came in with
slashing commercials ....''
   Helms' speeches and ads in the last week accused Gantt, the
black former mayor of Charlotte, of supporting racial quotas in
jobs. Other ads accused Gantt of running a ``secret campaign''
aimed at getting blacks to the polls.
   But Helms, who is seeking a fourth term, denied that his
campaign had injected race into the contest.
   ``Race is not an issue in this campaign,'' Helms said. ``I was
born white and he was born black and there is nothing either one of
us could do about it.
   ``We have not made an issue of race, but he has gone around the
state pleading for the bloc vote. He has right to do that, but he
has injected race into the campaign.''
   In Newark, N.J., a federal judge ruled Monday that the
Republican National Committee was not involved in efforts aimed at
intimidating black and elderly voters in the Helms-Gantt race.
   Democrats had accused the national GOP of indirectly aiding a
``ballot security'' program for Helms. The Democrats' complaint
said that violated a 1982 consent decree on voter intimidation that
was issued in the federal judge's court.
   The ruling centered on mailings sent by North Carolina
Republicans that warned voters in predominantly minority districts
that it was a federal crime to provide election officials with
false information.
   Gantt told more than 1,000 people at a rally in Raleigh that he
had campaigned on values that are important to the state.
   ``We've said it was important for us to care about our children,
to care about the environment, to care about health care, to care
about the human condition,'' Gantt said. ``We've kept to the high
road. We're going to win on tomorrow, that's right. How sweet
that's going to be.
   ``We want to turn things around. We don't want to have the
divisiveness that has characterized our senior senator.''
   Democratic Sen. Terry Sanford said the election would send a
message to the world.
   ``People all over the nation, indeed all over the world, are
watching this election more than any other,'' Sanford said. ``We
now have the opportunity to let people know what kind of people we
are.''
   Federal drug czar William Bennett, who accompanied Helms on his
flying tour of six cities, said he wanted ``to try to prevent this
national mugging organized by liberals from taking place.''

   Field Publications has settled charges that it
mailed books to its subscribers that they had not asked for or
agreed to receive, and then billed them for payment, the Federal
Trade Commission said Monday.
   Field, the publisher of Weekly Reader Books and other book
plans, said it has acted to correct shortcomings of which the FTC
had complained.
   Field spokeswoman Pat Sears said the company offers its book
club members two or three opportunities a year to purchase
``quality materials'' and ``the FTC felt that we needed to do a
better job of explaining how these programs work.''
   ``We agreed with them. In September of 1989, we put into place a
number of changes, including some not requested by the FTC, to
assure that our customers would be properly served,'' Ms. Sears
said from the company's office in Middletown, Conn.
   The FTC said the publishing company will pay civil penalties of
$175,000 and will be prohibited in the future from the practices
complained of, under a consent decree filed in federal court.
   A complaint acompanying the decree said Field mailed additional
books to subscribers who had consented to receive the company's
regular subscription books. It said the customers had not requested
the shipment of the additional books or given express consent to
having them mailed.
   Field then sent the customers invoices and dunned them for
payment for the books, the complaint said.
   The FTC said this violates the Unordered Merchandise Act, a
postal statute. It prohibits the mailing of unordered merchandise
except for free samples that are clearly and conspicuously marked.
It also prohibits the mailing or any bill or dunning notice to a
recipient of unordered merchandise.

<HEAD>Newspaper Strike Leader Has a Revolutionary Past and Present</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY NEUMEISTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Daily News columnist Juan Gonzalez
doesn't object to being called a revolutionary, long after he began
to agitate on behalf of fellow Puerto Ricans as a youth.
   ``When there's injustice, you have to fight it,'' he said. ``I
still consider myself a revolutionary, if you mean someone who gets
at the root of a problem in society and tries to correct it.''
   Gonzalez, a strike organizer for The Newspaper Guild, was once a
leader of the militant youth group Young Lords. His past draws
respect and a certain amount of amusement from his colleagues at
the newspaper.
   In the Daily News library, his photo file still says: ``Puerto
Rican revolutionary.''
   ``That's crossed out. Now, it says, `Daily News columnist,'''
said fellow striker Robert Gearty.
   Gonzalez file may or may not be changed again, depending on the
outcome of the strike by nine of 10 unions at the newspaper that
has thrust him into the role of a strike leader.
   One minute, he is talking through a megaphone at a rally in
front of the News building. The next, he is meeting with Jesse
Jackson before a rally.
   Gonzalez' colleagues on the picket line react energetically when
he puts his hand on their shoulders to discuss how to produce the
next union newsletter or strategy on the picket line.
   Gonzalez is co-chairman of his union's strike organizing
committee.
   ``Isn't Juan amazing?'' Gearty said. ``I saw him the other day.
I said, `Juan, where do I go to sign up for the Young Lords?'''
   The Young Lords battled with authorities to push the cause of
Puerto Rican independence and fair treatment of Puerto Ricans in
the United States.
   During the group's heyday from 1969 to 1974, Gonzalez served as
its minister of education and health and at one point as minister
of defense.
   They blocked major avenues in East Harlem with garbage to
protest poor trash collection. They collected eggs, bacon and bread
from merchants and cooked breakfast for schoolchildren. They staged
sit-ins at a hospital and a church, the latter leading to the
arrest of 110 demonstrators.
   At one point, the group tried to replace police at the front of
a parade, leading police to attack the demonstrators and causing a
major disturbance.
   ``We got a little arrogant in our popularity,'' Gonzalez said.
``We were blamed, and rightly so, for a raucous ... mess.''
   Born in Puerto Rico 43 years ago, Gonzalez was raised in New
York by a mother who was a garment worker and a father who labored
in a restaurant. Both belonged to unions.
   In 1968, Gonzalez refused to accept his diploma from Columbia
University when the school asked him to plead guilty to violating
university regulations for his role in a student strike that shut
down the school for six weeks.
   The same year, he participated in protests at the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago.
   Gonzalez spent the next decade steam pressing men's suits at a
garment factory and as a pressman at a printing plant because ``I
was afraid if I became a professional I would become a sellout or a
wimp.''
   He eventually gave in to his lifelong dream of writing for a
newspaper by accepting a clerk's position at the Philadelphia Daily
News, where he quickly became a reporter and helped organize a
strike in 1985.
   Marnal Whitley, a striking librarian, said when he first learned
about Gonzalez's past, ``I thought maybe it was an ironic twist,
that maybe he had sold out.''
   ``But when I read his columns, I saw he was still a
revolutionary. He is still on the side of the oppressed,'' Whitley
said.

<HEAD>Voters to Cast Ballots in Clerk's Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CROSBY, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Larry and Bonnie Carlson's living room will
be the most popular spot in Dean Lake Township on Tuesday. That's
where the township's 42 registered voters will go to cast their
ballots.
   Residents usually vote at the township hall. But the old hall
was so dilapidated it was deliberately burned down. And the new
hall isn't ready to be used yet.
   So with no polling place, Bonnie Carlson, the township clerk,
volunteered her home.
   ``We needed a place to vote, and our place was available,'' she
said.
   The home, which overlooks the Mississippi River and is about 10
miles northeast of Crosby, is also new. The living room floor is
unfinished, but that's just as well considering Tuesday's foot
traffic. If past history is a guide, most of the township's
registered voters will cast ballots.
   The township's single voting booth has been set up in the living
room. Tuesday morning, Carlson will set up a table for the three
election judges. Then she'll start serving coffee and cookies.
   Carlson isn't concerned about opening her home to the voters.
   ``I know all the people,'' she said. ``And we won't talk
politics.''

<HEAD>`NBC Nightly News' To Do Entire Show on American Concerns and
Hopes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the equivalent of a newspaper devoting an
entire edition to one subject, ``NBC Nightly News'' will use all of
Friday's show to report on the state of the nation and how
Americans feel about their country.
   However, if there is major breaking news that day, ``we'll put
it on, of course,'' said Steve Friedman, the program's executive
producer.
   NBC announced the unusual move Monday. The ``CBS Evening News''
and ABC's ``World News Tonight'' never have devoted one of their
broadcasts to a single subject, spokesmen for those programs said.
   Friedman conceded the action was unsual but said the importance
of the subject warranted it. He noted that the three network
newscasts in early August were largely devoted to a single subject
- the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Friday's ``Nightly News'' will include satellite hook-ups in
which people can question their elected officials.
   It also will include reports on the economy, foreign
competition, and young Americans entering an uncertain marketplace.
   Anchored by Tom Brokaw, ``Nightly'' has been battling with Dan
Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' for second place in ratings in
evening newscasts. Peter Jennings ``World News Tonight'' has been
consistently first in the A.C. Nielsens Co. ratings.

<HEAD>U.S. Elections: Some Vote Absentee, A Few by Fax</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>

   A handful of GIs voted by fax and
thousands more cast absentee ballots. But other troops in Operation
Desert Shield said they had too much on their minds to think about
Tuesday's elections back home.
   ``What election is it?'' asked Sgt. Marceline Griffin, 39, of
Philadelphia, an operating room technician with the 326th Medical
Battalion. ``I haven't seen an absentee ballot yet.''
   Cpl. Patrick Locke, 20, of Spokane, Wash., who was repairing the
engine of a tanker on Monday at a forward Marine base in eastern
Saudi Arabia, was equally astonished.
   ``I think we have so much on our mind now, and have so much work
to do, we don't have time to think about it,'' he said. ``The way
they vote, they help decide how long we'll be over here. I wish I
knew more about it.''
   A three-week ``get out the vote'' blitz on Armed Forces Radio
and voting information booths in many of the big mess halls
produced good results. About 100,000 applications for absentee
ballots were handed out by the Judge Advocate's office of the Army
Forces Central Command, which was in charge of promoting
registration.
   The Navy launched a similar campaign for the elections, which
include congressional and gubernatorial races. Sailors aboard the
USS Biddle, a guided missile cruiser, voted by absentee ballot
three weeks ago in Alexandria, Va.
   ``Voting is your right,'' said Chief Petty Officer Steven Sisk,
45, of Fremont, Calif. ``If you don't vote, don't bitch.''
   Maj. Jerry Kineen, 46, of Boston, a lawyer on the staff of the
Judge Advocate in the Army Forces Central Command, said it's a
misconception that most troops didn't vote.
   ``Probably, of those who were over here, more of them voted in
this election than would have voted had they not been here because
it was made easier for them,'' said Lt. Col. Kevin V. Murphy, 44,
of Hanover, Mass., the deputy staff judge advocate.
   ``They didn't have to drive down to a polling place and take
time off from work to vote. We came right to them,'' he said.
   Marine Cpl. Daryl Cherry, 21, of Harrington, Del., watching a
football game during a break from work, said: ``I know the
opportunity is here to vote. Really, I don't know who to vote for.
I don't even know who the candidates are. It would be like drawing
straws and I'd rather not do that.''
   Staff Sgt. Lee Corkran, 28, of Tucson, Ariz., who is with the
Air Force Combat Camera Team, said he didn't vote because he felt
removed.
   ``From here, America seems like some kind of dreamland,'' he
said.
   Many servicemen said they had trouble with the mail.
   Cpl. Frank Gillyard Jr., 21, of Mansfield, La., with the Marine
Wing Support Squadron, said he hadn't received his absentee ballot
and probably wouldn't get to vote.
   With 60 to 90 tons of mail arriving every day, and delays on
outgoing mail as well, it's impossible to say how may servicemen
and women actually received ballots and voted.
   The election marked the debut of fax voting.
   ``There has been a limited voting by fax. Some of the individual
cities and towns did allow this,'' said Kineen.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, filed suit against Tennessee,
the only state it said had refused to accept absentee ballot
applications sent by fax by GIs stationed in the Middle East.
   The lawsuit seeks a court order directing Tennessee officials to
accept three applications sent to Shelby County voter registars.
The department also wants the state to send absentee ballots to the
three GIs so they can vote in Tuesday's election.
   Murphy said a few ballots arrived by fax, and were faxed back
after completion, but added, ``One of the problems of sending them
by fax is that there is no envelope to put the ballot back in. It's
supposed to be a secret ballot.''
   Lt. Col. Bill Hagan, 43, of Key West, Fla., the staff judge
advocate with the Army who is in charge of the registration
program, said he sent his absentee form early.
   ``I'm so glad I voted because I got mail - I got campaign mail
from across the board in Florida,'' he said. ``It made me feel
closer to home.''

<HEAD>Judge Finds National Republicans Not Involved in Helms Mailing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs of comment by Justice Department official.
Debevoise is pronounced deb'-eh-voy</NOTE>

   The Republican National Committee was not
involved in efforts aimed at intimidating black and elderly voters
in North Carolina's close U.S. Senate race, a federal judge ruled
Monday.
   ``The Democratic National Committee has not been able to
establish that the Republican National Committee is involved
directly or indirectly with activities taking place in North
Carolina,'' said U.S. District Judge Dickinson Debevoise.
   Democrats had accused the national GOP of indirectly aiding a
``ballot security'' program for Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, who is
locked in a neck-and-neck race with Democrat Harvey Gantt, who is
black. The Democrats' complaint said that violated a 1982 consent
decree on voter intimidation that was issued in Debevoise's court.
   The election-eve ruling centered on mailings sent by North
Carolina Republicans that warned voters in predominantly minority
districts that it was a federal crime to provide election officials
with false information.
   Party officials, Republican and Democratic, hailed the ruling.
   ``What the judge did today was stop a fishing expedition,'' said
Thomas Kirby, an attorney retained by the RNC. ``There was no
indication that we were involved in what was going on in North
Carolina.''
   Democrats also claimed victory.
   ``I'm satisfied because I want the RNC to know that we're
watching,'' said Bob Bauer, the Democrats' counsel. ``We will be
watching every county and precinct in North Carolina for minority
disenfranchisement.''
   At issue are 150,000 postcards that the North Carolina GOP sent
to predominantly minority Democratic precincts.
   A section on the card told voters it is a federal crime ``to
knowingly give false information about your name, residence or
period of residence to an election official.''
   Voter mailings also have been distributed to mostly elderly
Democratic voters in Texas to encourage them to forego absentee
ballots.
   The hearing did not address the Texas mailings.
   Debevoise found that Republicans had failed to inform their
staff and state campaigns of the 1982 consent decree that bars
voter intimidation. The decree was issued after the party was
reported to have hired armed guards to watch over various polling
places in New Jersey.
   Deveboise ordered national Republicans to remind their campaign
staffs not to violate the decree, and suggested that Democrats
should turn to North Carolina courts if they were not happy with
the voter mailing.
   Democrats also have charged Helms with playing on racial
stereotypes in television advertisements. Republicans have denied
the charges.
   RNC counsel Ben Ginsberg said he did not know if the national
GOP had asked Helms to stop his mailing campaign and similar
tactics.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said the
agency was taking ``appropriate steps to ensure there is no voter
intimidation'' in North Carolina.
   But Eramian declined to way what steps the Justice Department
was taking in response to a request from the Democratic National
Committee that it investigate the mailings in North Carolina.

   With polls showing the governor's race
almost a dead heat, Democrat Ann Richards stumped through
traditional Democratic strongholds Monday and Republican Clayton
Williams got a push from President Bush.
   The president, not wanting to be embarrassed in the state he
calls home, campaigned alongside Williams in Tyler, Waco and
Houston.
   ``I urge all Texans ... to get out there and vote and do not
take democracy for granted. You have a chance to make a
difference,'' Bush said in Tyler.
   Richards, riding Williams' weekend admission that he paid no
income tax in 1986, campaigned from Orange in eastern Texas to the
Rio Grande Valley on the Mexican border.
   The winner of Tuesday's election will succeed two-term
Republican Gov. Bill Clements, who is retiring.
   The governor's election was `too close to call' as of Sunday
night, said the Houston firm of Tarrance &amp; Associates, which
wrapped up a telephone survey of 1,000 registered voter.
   And a poll published Sunday by the Houston Chronicle showed
oilman-rancher Williams with a slim lead over two-term state
treasurer Richards, 44 percent to 39 percent. That same poll in
mid-September had shown Williams up by 15 points, 48-33.
   ``The only person who can elect Richards is Claytie, and he's
working hard at it,'' pollster Richard Murray of the University of
Houston told the Chronicle.
   That poll was conducted before Williams' two last-minute gaffes
- his no-income tax admission and his apparent failure during a TV
appearance to understand the proposed constitutional amendment on
gubernatorial appointments.
   Richards said the remarks bolstered her arguments that the
Republican, making his first bid for public office, didn't
understand state government and that as one of the state's
wealthiest men he didn't understand the needs of average Texans.
   She hit the airwaves with a last-minute radio commercial that
charged: ``Millions of average Texans paid taxes, while (Williams)
took advantage of loopholes for the rich.''
   Williams said he paid no income taxes because he lost money when
oil prices tumbled from near $30 per barrel to less than $10.
   Williams' spokesman Gordon Hensley said Williams' creation of 26
companies and 100,000 jobs proved he could run state government.
   He labeled the income tax attack a last-gasp assault.
   The governor's race was the most expensive in Texas history. A
week before the election, Williams had reported spending $20.4
million, including $8 million of his own money. Richards' campaign
spending topped $11 million.

   Sales of existing homes from July through
September slipped 2.5 percent from their level a year earlier and
will remain slow in the first half of 1991 because of the weakening
economy, a real estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously
owned homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.66
million units in the three-month period. Sales declined in the
year's two previous quarters as well.
   The Realtors recorded sales of 3.78 million last year, down from
3.95 million in 1988.
   Although there were areas of strength in the housing industry
during the third quarter, sales declined in 28 states and were
unchanged in Oregon. Nineteen states posted increases. Statistics
were unavailable for Alaska and Maine.
   Overall, however, ``the market will remain slow for the rest of
1990 and into the first half of 1991, as the country experiences a
mild recession,'' Realtors President Norman A. Flynn said.
   The Realtors also reported the median price of an existing home
was $96,600, 1.8 percent above that for the third quarter of 1989.
It ranged from $375,000 in Honolulu to $49,200 in Saginaw, Mich.,
among the 96 metropolitan statistical areas surveyed.
   The median price means half of the homes cost more, half less.
The survey includes detached homes, town houses, apartment
condominiums and co-operatives.
   The only region experiencing increased sales was the South,
where sales rose 1.4 percent to an annual rate of 1.42 million.
Several oil patch areas that had suffered adverse market conditions
in recent years recorded increases.
   Texas had a third-quarter increase of 8.8 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 246,300 units. Oklahoma, another
oil-producing state, posted a 7.3 percent gain to 55,100 units.
Sales were up 5.9 percent in Louisiana to 37,100 units.
   The median price of a home in the South was $87,200, up 1.8
percent from a year earlier.
   The Midwest's sales rate of 1.0 million units dropped 1.0
percent in the third quarter. The median price jumped 3.6 percent
to $75,100.
   John A. Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist, said the
availability of moderately priced houses boosted sales in the South
and kept them from falling faster in the Midwest.
   Sales in the West fell 8.8 percent to an annual rate of 580,000
and in the Northeast were down 8.5 percent to a 650,000 rate.
   Tuccillo said the decline in the West largely resulted from a
sharp drop in coastal California markets. The median price dropped
5.3 percent to $138,200, reflecting more purchases in less costly,
inland markets.
   Sales in the Northeast have been sluggish for nearly two years
and, ``although Pennsylvania resale activity appears to be
recovering, the rest of the region, particularly along the
Boston-New York corridor, remains down in the dumps,'' Flynn said.
   The median price of a home in the Northeast dropped 2.7 percent
to $143,100.
   ``Home sales along the New York-Boston corridor have been
gridlocked by sellers who've been reluctant to lower their prices
to fit a buyers' market, and by buyers who've been waiting for
lower prices,'' Tuccillo said.

   Both sides claimed an edge Monday in a special
parliamentary election viewed as a referendum on a government
proposal to send troops to the Persian Gulf. But the low turnout
was seen as an even clearer sign of Japanese sentiment.
   Only 38.7 percent of the 4.8 million eligible voters in the
Aichi district bothered to vote Sunday.
   Yoshihisa Oshima, a 50-year-old dentist from the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, narrowly defeated Michiko Goto of the
Japan Socialist Party for a seat in the upper house, winning a 45
percent to 43 percent plurality.
   The Liberal Democrats backed away from calling the slim victory
an endorsement of its troop deployment bill, which faces likely
defeat in Parliament.
   Aichi is an LDP stronghold and the home district of Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, sponsor of the troop deployment bill.
   The Socialists called the election results a clear repudittion
of the proposal because Goto and Communist Party candidate Yukiko
Seko together drew 55 percent of the vote, or 1,003,815 votes to
Oshima's 833,371.
   Kanju Sato, the Socialist Party's election committee chairman,
declared: ``This was proof that a great number of citizens oppose
the Self-Defense Forces deployment bill. We will fight harder to
prevent the bill from being passed.''
   A statement issued by Kaifu read, ``I'm so glad that we won as a
result of the efforts by the candidate and the entire party.''
   Kaifu visited Aichi, southwest of Tokyo, twice during the
campaign. The Japan Times said more than 100 LDP members of the
Diet (parliament) were sent in to campaign for Oshima.
   Hideo Sato, international politics professor at Tsukuba
University, commented, ``Japanese voters are most interested in
bread and butter and the bill has little to do with that.''
   Parliament now is debating the ``United Nations Peace
Cooperation Bill.'' The prime minister says any troops sent to the
gulf under the measure would be limited to non-combat roles. He has
been under pressure from the United States and other nations that
want Japan to provide more than money for gulf multinational forces
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Some members of Kaifu's own party agree with the opposition's
argument that the proposal would violate Japan's post-World War II
constitution, which prohibits the use of force to settle
international disputes.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged
churches once divided over apartheid to work together for a
peaceful future as he opened a church conference Monday.
   About 300 delegates from 90 churches are meeting in hopes of
reaching agreement on how to help South Africa move peacefully to a
non-discriminatory democracy. They will spend five days at the
National Conference of Churches, billed as the largest such meeting
to be held in South Africa.
   The conference in Rustenburg, 62 miles northwest of
Johannesburg, has brought together the white branch of the Dutch
Reformed Church with its black and mixed-race branches.
   The white Dutch Reformed Church, the main church of the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners who dominate the government, argued for
decades that the Bible supported apartheid. It has changed that
view and says it wants to merge with the other branches.
   The black and mixed-race branches have staunchly opposed
apartheid.
   Tutu, the Anglican archbishop who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
for his anti-apartheid activism, called for reconciliation. ``We
come here not to engage in recrimination,'' he said in the opening
speech.
   ``In this land we are bound together by common humanity, by
having one God. The only way we will ever be able to survive, to be
free, to be human, is together, black and white,'' Tutu said.
   Khoza Mgogo, president of the South African Council of Churches,
urged delegates to adopt strategies for redistribution of wealth,
most of which is in the hands of the white minority.
   ``The beauty of the meeting is that we are bringing the whole
Christian community of South Africa together - the establishment
Afrikans churches and their anti-apartheid counterparts,'' the Rev.
Frank Chikane, a conference organizer, told the Sunday Times.
   ``For the first time there is the distinct possibility that the
Christian churches - representing 78 percent of the population -
can speak with one voice on apartheid and the country's future,''
he said.
   Two relatively small white churches that still support apartheid
- the Afrikaans Protestant Church and the Reformed Church - are not
attending.
   Many of the churches represented belong to the South African
Council of Churches, which often has been at the forefront of the
anti-apartheid movement. Chikane is the general secretary of the
council.
   The nation's church leaders met 30 years ago in an attempt to
forge a united front to challenge apartheid, but the agreement
collapsed when the Dutch Reformed Church rejected it.
   The current conference was organized after President F.W. de
Klerk urged church leaders to develop a common position on the role
they envision for the church in the future.
   De Klerk has said he wants to dismantle the apartheid system and
negotiate a new constitution that would allow the country's 5
million whites and 30 million blacks to share power.
   South Africa is predominantly Christian, with large numbers of
Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists, Zionists and Pentecostalists.
There also are many Jews and Moslems in the nation.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Students Call Anti-Government Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Demands grew in Bulgaria on Monday for
Socialist Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov to resign, and the main
opposition alliance declared it was ready to form a new government
if he stepped down.
   Students called a sit-in strike at Sofia University on Monday to
press demands that the Socialists, the former Communists, accept
guilt for past mistakes and that party property be returned to the
state, the state BTA news agency said.
   Many students also demanded Lukanov's resignation, it said.
   TV news reported that workers at the main petrochemical works at
Bourgas demanded the government resign within three days. BTA said
the independent Podkrepa trade union backed the students' demands.
   Interior Minister Pencho Penev asked the students to reconsider.
He warned on the evening TV news of ``undesirable political
consequences.''
   Students have wielded considerable political influence in
Bulgaria since longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted
in a Politburo coup one year ago. In July, a monthlong student
sit-in prompted the resignation of Socialist President Petar
Mladenov.
   Last Thursday, Lukanov himself threatened to resign if
Parliament refused to support his proposals for pulling Bulgaria
out of its economic and political chaos. He demanded a clear answer
within a week.
   He said then that the Socialists could not refute ``accusations
of our guilt'' but warned against ``witch hunts'' while the country
is in crisis.
   The opposition Union of Democratic Forces holds 144 of the 400
seats in Parliament. It has refused to join a Socialist-led
government or back the government's program.
   UDF parliamentary floor leader Stoyan Ganev told a news
conference Monday that the 17-party alliance was prepared to form a
government.
   He said a UDF-dominated government would not mean a coalition
with the Socialists, who hold 211 parliamentary seats.
   Ganev said the UDF would want to hold the prime minister's job
and key ministries, including foreign policy, defense, internal
affairs, economics and finance.
   ``Representatives of the Bulgarian Socialist Party who accept
our conditions could also take part in this government,'' Ganev
said.
   Ganev said Monday the idea of a UDF-dominated government had the
support of the two largest trade unions.
   The UDF claims it would have broad support. It says that
according to opinion polls, the opposition would win a majority if
elections were held now.

<TEXT>
   Raymond Oliver, one of the greatest French chefs of
the century and author of 26 books on cooking, died Monday after a
long illness, his family announced. He was 81.
   Born at Langon in the celebrated Bordeaux food region in 1909,
Oliver was the son and grandson of cooks. His maternal grandmother
gave him cooking lessons at an early age and he began his
apprenticeship under his father at age 15.
   In 1948, he purchased one of the great Parisian restaurants, Le
Grand Vefour, and turned it into an exclusive dining spot for
celebrities like politician Andre Malraux, actor Jean Cocteau and
writer Colette.
   Oliver detested the light nouvelle cuisine popular in recent
years. His specialty was perfecting the rich cuisine of his
Bordeaux youth: foie gras, Sauterne, dove and caviar.
   ``The important thing is design,'' he once said. ``To make good
cuisine, it's necessary to have a solid base.''
   La Vefour earned Michelin's prized third star five years after
Oliver bought it. He ran it until his retirement at 75 following a
terrorist bombing at the restaurant.
   Together with Guy Gerard, Jean-Claude Vrinat and Jacques
Maniere, Oliver was one of the most highly regarded chefs of his
era. He won several of France's top honors, including Officer of
the Legion of Honor.
   But his gift of communication elevated Oliver above his
contemporaries. He was a prolific writer and from 1953 to 1968
played host to the country's most popular television food program,
``Art and Magic From the Kitchen.''
   A series of recorded recipes, ``Cuisinorama,'' sold hundreds of
thousands of copies and Oliver defended French cuisine in lectures
and seminars in the United States, Japan, South Africa and Iceland.
   He was married and had four children. One of his sons
established a chain of restaurants in French train stations. His
family did not disclose the cause of death, and other details on
survivors were not disclosed.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<HEAD>Size of U.N. Central American Monitoring Group is Cut</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Monday cut the
size of the U.N. border patrol force in Central America, saying the
monitors' main mission has been accomplished with peace in
Nicaragua.
   In the unanimous vote, the 15-member council also extended the
mandate of the U.N. Observer Group in Central America for six
months.
   U.N. officials said Central American presidents requested the
extension, seeking to maintain a U.N. military presence in the
region to deter cross-border support for insurgencies.
   Since its formation a year ago, the multinational force has been
deployed in five Central American countries, but its main role was
to oversee the demobilization of Nicaragua's Contra rebels
following a nine-year civil war.
   More than 22,000 Contras in Nicaragua and neighboring Honduras
had disbanded by July after Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and a
14-party coalition defeated the Sandinistas in Feb. 25 elections.
Mrs. Chamorro now is president.
   The Security Council voted to cut the number of monitors from
413 to 158 by mid-December and put it under the command of a
brigadier general. The 11-nation force has been led by Maj. Gen.
Agustin Quesada Gomez of Spain.
   The council also voted to halve the number of helicopters from
12 to six, sending home nearly all of a 130-member Canadian air
unit.
   The vote followed recommendations of a report by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that acknowledged the
multinational force was ``very limited'' in its efforts to detect
secret shipments of weapons or ammunition from one country to
another.

<HEAD>Arens Says Gulf Crisis Readiness Costing Israel $1 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel has spent nearly $1 billion to raise the
army's alertness because of the Persian Gulf crisis, Defense
Minister Moshe Arens said Monday.
   Spokesman Danny Naveh quoted the minister from a speech to the
U.S.-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Tel Aviv.
   ``The gulf crisis has forced Israel to raise its level of alert,
to mobilize certain reserve units and reorganize the positioning of
some forces,'' Arens said, according to Naveh. The remarks also
were broadcast on state radio and television.
   Arens said the moves cost Israel about $1 billion and that he
had asked the United States for more military assistance to cover
the costs, Naveh said.
   Israel has so far maintained a low profile in the crisis, which
began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The army has distributed gas masks to Israeli citizens following
Iraqi threats to attack with chemical weapons. The military
announced Monday that it would issue the masks to foreign nationals
from Nov. 12-16.
   Meanwhile, a prominent newspaper reported Monday that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein had sought a meeting about a year ago with
then-defense minister Yitzhak Rabin via an Arab-American
businessman.
   But Saddam canceled two meetings, that were to have been held in
Europe, the Haaretz daily reported.
   It also said Rabin had refused a proposal for PLO
representatives to be at the meeting, and the plan was put on hold
in February.
   The arrangements were reportedly made while Rabin was in
Philadelphia visiting the businessman, identified only as an oil
magnate and president of a prominent bank.
   According to Haaretz, the businessman himself initiated the
contacts after meeting Saddam in Baghdad, and got to Rabin through
Israeli businessman Azriel Einav.
   The newspaper said it was generally assumed that Saddam wanted
to see Rabin following reports that Israel was likely to attack
chemical weapons factories in Iraq. It said the White House was
informed of these indirect Israeli-Iraqi contacts.
   Haaretz wrote that Rabin refused comment on the report, and that
his former spokesman Eitan Haber confirmed ``something like that''
was true, without elaborating. Neither Rabin nor Haber could be
reached for comment on Monday.

<HEAD>EPA Says Large Cities, Counties Must Limit Storm Runoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Monday that large cities and heavily populated suburban counties
must develop programs to reduce contamination of water that flows
through storm sewers.
   The requirements apply to cities with a population of more than
100,000 as well as to heavily populated suburban counties and is
hoped to reduce the discharge of pollutants into public storm sewer
systems and eventually into public waterways.
   The EPA said that about 100,000 industrial facilities also must
obtain federal permits for discharging water into public sewer
systems.
   The new EPA rules are required by a 1987 law that ordered the
agency to reduce runoff pollution in water that flows into storm
sewers. Storm water often contains a wide range of pollutants
including toxic pesticides from lawns and oil or grease from roads
and parking lots.
   ``The best way for municipalities and industry to meet the storm
water regulations and protect the quality of our waters is to
prevent pollution before it washes into the storm sewers,'' said
LaJuana Wilcher, an EPA assistant administrator.
   Pollution in storm sewers often is released directly into
rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, posing threats to drinking
water as well as the recreational use of these waters, said the
EPA.
   The release of the storm water regulations was welcomed by
environmentalists.
   But Bob Adler, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the regulations should cover more municipalities and
urban areas. The EPA rules ``cover only about half of the urban
areas required by the 1987 law,'' said Adler.

   Snow was scattered Monday over the Midwest and the Plains and
rain dampened much of the country.
   At least 11 inches of snow blanketed parts of Idaho and at least
10 inches fell in Yellowstone National Park. The Great Lakes region
and the Missouri Valley also got snow.
   Travel was dangerous in northern Michigan, where wind chills
dipped to zero. Gaylord, Mich., got at least 10 inches of snow.
   Snow also fell in northwest Missouri. Power was knocked out for
several hours to about 5,600 people in Independence after
snow-heavy tree limbs toppled electricity lines, said David
Ferguson, a spokesman for Independence Power &amp; Light.
   Kansas City received at least 4 inches of snow and Polo got
about 10 inches. North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and
the Idaho panhandle also received snow.
   Rain, turning to sleet in some spots, fell in Alabama, Georgia,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin,
South Dakota and other parts of Michigan.
   Other snowfall during the six-hour period that ended at noon CST
included four inches in Drummond, Mont., Helena, Mont., and Lander,
Wyo.
   The early winter blast, four days after a spell of Indian summer
sent temperatures soaring to the 70s, drew a mixed response from
Michigan residents.
   ``I think everyone in northern Michigan knows it can approach
real fast and bury you,'' said Sherry Barrett, from Petoskey. ``I'm
ready to ski. If I can't be playing in the sun and the sand, I want
snow.''
   Rain on Sunday and overnight overflowed the banks of some
streams and rivers in Indiana and Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. CST ranged from 20
degrees in Glasgow, Mont., to 86 degrees in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The low Monday in the Lower 48 states was 8 degrees at Sioux

<TEXT>
   Minnesota's turbulent governor's race on
Monday appeared headed for a cliffhanger. Pollsters declared the
election between Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich and Republican Arne
Carlson too close to call.
   Perpich, 62, seeking an unprecedented fourth term in Tuesday's
election, spent half the day drumming up enthusiasm for the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor ticket in northeastern Minnesota, the
party's traditional stronghold.
   State auditor Carlson, 56, wound up his abbreviated campaign in
southwestern and central Minnesota, where GOP sentiment is strong.
Carlson became the Republican candidate only last week after GOP
nominee Jon Grunseth withdrew amid allegations of sexual
improprieties.
   Results of polls published Sunday in the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press showed the race a
virtual dead heat.
   The Star Tribune-KSTP-TV Minnesota Poll showed Carlson with 44
percent and Perpich with 43 percent. Three percent of the
respondents favored other candidates and 10 percent were undecided.
The poll surveyed 1,003 likely voters from Wednesday through
Saturday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage
points.
   In the Pioneer Press-WCCO Poll, Perpich was favored by 39
percent and Carlson by 38 percent. Twenty-two percent of those
surveyed were undecided and 2 percent favored other candidates.
Results of the poll, conducted Oct. 29 through Thursday among 760
likely voters, are considered reliable within a margin of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
   Both campaigns focused Monday on getting their supporters out to
vote and swaying undecided Minnesotans to their side.
   ``We're getting a very strong sense the undecideds are breaking
strongly not only to the governor but to the DFL ticket,'' said
John Stanoch, Perpich's campaign chairman.
   Lars Carlson, the GOP candidate's brother and campaign chairman,
said internal polling showed Carlson's strength increasing in
western Minnesota and in northern Twin Cities suburbs.
   ``The trend is good,'' Carlson said. ``It's not dramatic,
however. It is very, very tight. The outcome will hinge on turnout.
We're hoping for good weather and a strong turnout.''
   Carlson's first wish may be granted: the outlook is for good
weather, at least by Minnesota standards for November.
   ``It'll be a little bit dreary, basically - a typical, gray
November sky,'' said forecaster Rich Naistat of the National
Weather Service in Minneapolis.

   Felix S. Bloch, the career diplomat who was
suspected of espionage, was fired Monday by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III because of ``deliberate false statements,'' the
State Department announced.
   Bloch, who had been under investigation since early last year on
suspicion of passing secrets to Soviet agents, was given written
notice of Baker's decision.
   In a brief statement, the department said Baker found that the
55-year-old Bloch's removal from the foreign service ``was
necessary because of his deliberate false statements or
misrepresentations to the FBI in the course of a national security
investigation.''
   Bloch's dismissal also was based on his ``behavior, activities
and associations,'' the statement said. There was no further
elaboration.
   ``In view of the national security aspects of this case and the
privacy rights of the individual employee, the evidence against Mr.
Bloch cannot be made public,'' the State Department said. The
department's legal affairs office is reviewing Bloch's pension
rights.
   The telephone at Bloch's residence was answered by a machine and
he did not immediately respond to messages seeking his reaction to
Baker's decision.
   Bloch submitted his resignation on July 5 and withdrew a request
for a hearing on the State Department's attempt to fire him. But
State officials said they would not act upon his resignation until
Baker had ruled on whether to fire him on security grounds.
   On Feb. 8, the State Department suspended Bloch from his
$80,700-a-year job in the European Affairs Bureau and said it would
seek to fire him.
   The 30-year veteran of the foreign service was suspected by the
FBI of selling secrets to the Soviet Union. But the FBI was never
able to identify any specific instance where Bloch passed
classified data to the Soviets, and charges were never filed. A
criminal investigation of Bloch's activities remains open.
   During the summer of 1989, Bloch was the subject of extensive
FBI surveillance which was widely covered by news media. He led
processions of FBI agents, reporters and cameramen on walks around
the Washington area, and up to the New York City suburbs to visit
relatives, after it was first publicly reported in late July 1989
that he was under suspicion.
   The surveillance ended late last year after the bureau decided
it was unlikely it could prove a case in court. But in U.S.
District Court here in May, the State Department won the right to
use evidence gathered from secret FBI electronic surveillance of
Bloch in the dismissal case against him.
   Investigators believed Bloch was recruited to spy for the
Soviets in 1974 while he was serving as economic counselor in the
newly opened U.S. Embassy in East Berlin. He spent two years there
after transferring from West Berlin where he had served since 1970.
   Bloch served in Austria from 1980 to 1987 as economic counselor
and then as the second-ranking official in the U.S. Embassy.
   Electronic surveillance was reported to have picked up Bloch
telling his wife in 1989 that he had accepted payments from the
Soviets. French agents acting on a U.S. tip reportedly photographed
him meeting in Paris in the spring of 1989 with a Soviet agent.
   A former Viennese prostitute told the federal grand jury that
has been examining his finances that Bloch spent roughly $10,000 a
year for her services over seven years - an amount investigators
could not find withdrawn from Bloch's acknowledged bank accounts.

<TEXT>
   Officials in Soviet Georgia have decided to move
Wednesday's Revolution Day military parade from the streets of the
republic's capital of Tbilisi to a field on an army base, Tass
reported Monday.
   The decision in the southern republic, where non-Communists have
just scored a big electoral victory, marked the latest blow to the
once-sacred holiday and a further erosion of the Communist Party's
role in society.
   The holiday marks the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution.
   At least two officially sanctioned counterdemonstrations by
anti-Communist groups are being held this year in Moscow, with the
protesters urging a ``day of mourning'' for people killed by the
totalitarian regime. Alternative rallies also will be held in
Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk and other cities.
   Also on Monday, the government newspaper Izvestia printed on its
front page a message by Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Alexi II,
in which he called for a sober analysis of the holiday.
   ``Let this day be a day of neither celebrations nor damnations,
but a day of meditation from the depth of human conscience,'' the
patriarch wrote.
   ``Let all the years that passed (since October 1917) rise in our
conscience one after another and persuade us not to pay for
politicians' experiments and principles with human destinies,'' he
said.
   Officials of the Transcaucasian Military District in Georgia
will hold the march by soldiers and the display of tanks and other
hardware on a parade ground of a Tbilisi garrison unit, the
official Soviet news agency said. The traditional parade route is
the central thoroughfare of the capital.
   ``This step was prompted by the difficult socio-political
situation in the republic and by our desire not to aggravate it,''
said Lt. Gen. A. Skory, a member of the district military council.
   In parliamentary elections in Georgia last month, non-communist
parties scored victories on a platform of capitalism and
independence from the Soviet Union.
   ``Members of the general public, war veterans, veteran workers
and families of servicemen have been invited to watch the parade,''
Skory told Tass.
   A traditional parade will take place in Leningrad, the
birthplace of the Revolution. But several anti-Communist groups
announced they will hold their own rallies, including a memorial
service for ``victims of the Communist regime'' at St. Nicholas
Cathedral.
   Authorities in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius broadcast a
statement telling the population to ignore the military parade that
will be held in Lukiskes Square on Wednesday. The statement said it
is a working day, and not a holiday.
   The Baltic News Service reported that authorities in the Latvian
capital of Riga prevented a wooden reviewing stand from being
burned down last week and arrested several people.
   In the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in the republic of
Azerbaijan, holiday celebrations have been canceled, Tass reported.
   Maj. Gen. V. Safonov, the military commandant of the mountainous
region that is predominantly Armenian but located inside
Azerbaijan, said he canceled festivities in the main city of
Stepanakert because of the emergency situation there, the news
agency said. Villages are still being attacked, people are
abducted, cattle is rustled and crimes by armed men are common, it
said.
   In the town of Inta, in northwestern Russia, members of the
Union of Working People plan to carry the flag of pre-Revolutionary
Russia in a protest rally on Wednesday, the Postfactum news service
reported.
   ``Citizens, by turning this mournful date into a holiday, we are
once again committing an act of outrage with respect to all sons
and daughters of Russia who perished in the bloody meat-chopper
started by the Communists,'' the group said in a statement.

   Political cartoonist Daniel Sanchez
Flores, known throughout Latin America by his penname Roger, has
died of cancer, the newspaper Barricada reported Monday. He was 30.
   The newspaper, a pro-Sandinista publication in which Sanchez's
incisive cartoons ran, carried a story about his death Sunday with
a banner headline proclaiming, ``National Humor is in Mourning.''
   Sanchez directed the weekly humor sheet La Semana Comica, wrote
several comic books and contributed to various newspapers,
including the pro-government La Prensa.
   Considered an irreverent leftist, iconoclast and eroticist,
Sanchez's cartoons made him a controversial figure.
   He condemned double standards, bureaucracy and authoritarians.
He admired the Sandinista revolution, but criticized it for its
shortcomings.
   Sanchez won the Special Solidarity Prize in Cuba's 1980 annual
cartoon contest.
   His works, some of which were translated into English, include
the comic books ``This is Serious,'' ``Popular Cartoons,'' ``Two of
Lime and One of Salt'' and ``Erotic Humor.''
   Sanchez is survived by his wife, Marta, and their son, Lucas.

   Manufacturers would have to tell physicians
how prescription drugs affect elderly patients under a government
proposal announced Monday.
   The information, some of which is already provided voluntarily
by many companies already, would have to be included in drug
labeling sent to physicians and pharmacists, said the Food and Drug
Administration. This labeling, required by the FDA, is usually
available to patients upon request.
   ``As our knowledge has grown of how drugs work within the body,
we've recognized the special concerns associated with drug use in
the elderly,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
said in a statement.
   ``Physicians need to be provided with any patient information
that's available about the drugs they prescribe for senior
patients,'' he said.
   One of the differences between an old patient and a young one is
the ability of their kidneys - people lose a third or more of their
kidney function between the ages of 30 and 90, Sullivan said.
   With less kidney function, drugs do not clear the body as fast.
This might mean that a muscle relaxant that works fine for a young
person might relax older people too much, causing them to fall and
break a hip, he said.
   The American Association of Retired Persons said the proposal is
important because those over 65 account for more than 30 percent of
people taking prescription drugs while comprising 12 percent of the
population.
   ``One of the factors in drug misuse (by the elderly) is the
amount of elderly-specific information that comes from clinical
trials and then goes to physicians to guide their prescribing
practices,'' said Susan Raetzman, an AARP research analyst.
   The proposal would require manufacturers to include in physician
labeling all available information on the effects of the drug on
the elderly. This information could come from the clinical trials
in which the drug was tested before it was approved for commercial
sale, or from medical literature, said Dr. James Mason, assistant
secretary for health at HHS.
   If no information is available, that would have to be stated
clearly in the physician labeling, but this would be the case
primarily with drugs developed more than six years ago, said Dr.
Robert Temple, director of the FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation I.
   In the mid-1980s, the FDA began requiring companies to include
in drug applications any important data relating to the effects of
the drug on the over-65 population, he said. By 1988, most were
doing it, he said.
   In March, the FDA issued guidelines to encourage drug companies
to include the elderly when testing their products so they can pass
on any effects of the drug in the elderly.
   The labeling proposal ``could be made stronger if the FDA made
their guidelines for clinical trials mandatory,'' AARP's Raetzman
said. ``As it is now, their new labeling proposal is only as good
as the information underlying it.''
   The FDA's proposal would update the labeling regulation to
standardize and make clear what information should be included.
   The labeling information is also available in the Physicians
Desk Reference, which provides information on all prescription
drugs.
   The FDA said it will accept comments from the public for 60
days. After that, a final rule will be drafted and published in the
Federal Register.
   Drug manufacturers would have one year from the date of
publication to comply, updating the labeling of all their
prescription products.

   After more than three years of fighting
and 1,100 dead, the leaders of Lebanon's main Shiite militias
signed a treaty Monday allowing the Lebanese army to expand its
control over the nation.
   Nabih Berri, leader of the Syrian-backed Amal militia, and a top
official of the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah signed a peace accord
to allow army control of Shiite Moslem areas that included the
southern slums of Beirut where the 13 Western hostages had been
believed held.
   The peace agreement, which becomes effective Saturday, was
signed at the end of a 10-hour meeting with Syrian and Iranian
officials by Berri and Hezbollah Secretary-General Sheik Subhy
Tufeili.
   Amal, which means Hope in Arabic, and Hezbollah, or Party of
God, have fought intermittently since June 1987 vying for control
of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiite Moslems.
   They are among the major militias that Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi's government is trying to disarm to implement a peace plan to
end 15{ years of civil war.
   Present for the signing of the agreement were Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar
Velayati.
   Velayati said the subject of Western hostages in Lebanon,
believed to be held by groups loyal to Hezbollah, was not
discussed.
   Before Iranian and Syrian officials went into three days of
talks, there was speculation the hostage issue was a prime topic.
   But, Velayati said, ``We did not discuss this subject at all.''
   Sharaa and Velayati held a joint news conference after the
signing in which they expressed confidence the dispute between Amal
and Hezbollah is over.
   ``It is defititely settled,'' said Velayati.
   ``We are sure that two sides will fully implement this
agreement, and we are committed to provide the Lebanese army with
any support it might need,'' said al-Sharaa.
   The agreement stipulates that:
   -The two groups will eliminate all obstacles in the way of the
deployment of the Lebanese army in southern Lebanon ``in light of
the improvement of the army capacities to maintain law and order.''
   -In the event of disputes, ``the two parties are committed to
the interpretation provided by representatives of Syria and Iran.''
   -All people displaced as a result of the fighting between the
two parties will return to their areas' villages and homes.
   Hrawi's government wants all Christian and Moslem militias to
leave Beirut and its immediate suburbs as a first step toward
spreading the authority of the army throughout Lebanon.
   Major Christian and Druse militias have expressed approval of
the plan since the Lebanese and Syrian armies put down the
rebellion of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun on Oct. 13.
   Hezbollah is the umbrella for Shiite Moslem fundamentalist
factions believed to hold most of the Westerners in Lebanon.
   Lebanese security sources have said the hostage-holders moved
their captives from south Beirut to other hideouts, mainly in the
eastern Bekaa Valley, before the military move against Aoun.
   Syria, with its 40,000 troops in Lebanon, is the major
powerbroker in the country. It controls the Bekaa Valley, except
for pockets still possessed by Shiite groups.
   The missing westerners include six Americans, four Britons, two
Germans and an Italian. Longest held is Terry Anderson, the chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   There have been reports more of them would be released as Iran
improves its relations with Western nations, particularly Britain.
Other sources have said the U.S-led military buildup to confront
Iraq in the Persian Gulf has discouraged hostage-holders from
releasing their captives.
   Both Iran and Syria have condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. But Iran has also denounced the Western military presence
in the region, while Syria has committed more than 15,000 troops to
the multinational force.

<HEAD>EC Says It Won't Negotiate Hostage Releases With Saddam</HEAD>

   The European Community pledged anew Monday to remain
united against Saddam Hussein by refusing to negotiate individually
for the release of hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Italy, president of the 12-member EC, convened an emergency
foreign ministers' meeting Monday night at the request of Belgium
and the Netherlands to discuss potential cracks in the Community's
Iraq policy.
   The meeting followed a series of missions to Iraq, including a
trip to Baghdad on Monday by former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
   The ministers did not specifically condemn Brandt or any other
political figure.
   EC leaders adopted a declaration at a summit meeting in Rome a
week ago pledging not to send government representatives to Baghdad
and to discourage others from doing so.
   German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told reporters
after Monday night's meeting that his government does not consider
Brandt's trip a violation of EC policy.
   Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis of Italy, who presided at
the meeting, told a news conference the ministers agreed
unanimously to uphold the declaration on hostages.
   He said Saddam's policy of selectively releasing hostages
increases the prospect of military conflict in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We have achieved an important political result in a very
difficult situation,'' De Michelis said. ``We have clearly stated
that the political will of the 12 governments is the same - that
is, no government will accept any type of negotiations, explicit or
implicit, with the Iraqi government on the hostages.
   ``If the aim of Saddam Hussein is to utilize the hostages for
political advantage, he now has a clear answer from Rome - no. He
can have no political advantage from the hostage issue.''
   De Michelis said the 12 agreed the United Nations should be the
only mediator with Iraq on the hostages. He said he would press
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to increase his
efforts to send a personal envoy to Baghdad to discuss the issue.
   De Michelis said EC foreign ministry officials will meet this
week to examine a German proposal to send a Community delegation to
Tunisia, Algeria and Jordan to sound out prospects for a political
solution to the gulf crisis.
   The crisis began three months ago with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Britain and some other EC members have publicly criticized
Brandt's mission to Iraq.
   But De Michelis said Monday's meeting was not called to consider
Brandt's initiative. Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Giovanni
Castellaneta quoted Genscher as saying his government ``does not
want to give a positive or negative judgment'' on the trip by
Brandt, the 1971 Nobel peace laureate.
   Castellaneta said Italy respected Brandt as a statesman and was
convinced he would not violate EC policy.
   Brandt says his trip is a private mission and he is not going as
a representative of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.
   In an interview with a German newspaper, Brandt said he would
not negotiate with Saddam. He said he hoped he could help win the
release of German and other hostages.
   Brandt is just one of several prominent political figures
visiting Baghdad to obtain freedom for the hundreds of hostages
Iraq has detained to discourage the United States and its allies
from attacking.
   Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone met with Iraqi
officials over the weekend in an effort to free some of the more
than 300 Japanese held in the country.
   Former prime ministers David Lange of New Zealand, and Anker
Joergenson of Denmark are also reported to be planning trips to
Iraq.
   Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath traveled to Iraq last
month and won freedom for 38 Britons.
   In calling for the EC meeting, Belgian Foreign Minister Mark
Eyskens said Sunday, ``Saddam is creating this royal court of all
sorts of Western pilgrims who visit him to obtain the release of
hostages.''
   The meeting was only called on Monday. Just six foreign
ministers managed to attend. The rest sent high-ranking deputies.

<HEAD>Poll: Americans Unhappy With How Bush, Congress Dealing With
Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming margin of Americans believe
the nation's economy is worsening and are unhappy with how
President Bush and Congress are dealing with the problem, an ABC
News poll reported Monday.
   By a margin of 61 percent to 36 percent, respondents said they
disapproved of Bush's handling of the economy.
   And the survey found a comparable disapproval rating - 61
percent to 33 percent - when people were asked to rate
congressional Democrats' handling of the economy.
   The disapproval rate was somewhat higher for congressional
Republicans - 69 percent to 26 percent.
   Seventy-seven percent of those questioned said the economy was
getting worse, while only 4 percent said it was improving.
   The figures came from a survey of 1,015 people questioned
between Oct. 23 and 25. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
   The survey found Bush's approval rating has rebounded from its
low of 51 percent a week ago to 59 percent.
   Public opinion of Congress continues to drop, but those
questioned still like their own representatives.
   Disapproval of Congress was voiced by 72 percent of those
interviewed, while only 24 percent approved of the way the body was
doing its job.
   But when asked to rate their own representative, 54 percent
approved and 37 percent disapproved. Three weeks ago, approval of
individual representatives was at 64 percent.
   The survey also found the public strongly perceives Bush and his
party as tilting to the rich.
   ``Overall, would you say Bush cares more about serving poor and
lower income people, middle income people, upper income people, or
would you say he cares equally about serving all people?'' the
survey asked.
   In response to that question, 3 percent said poor and lower
income, 5 percent said middle income, 55 percent said upper income
and 36 percent said all equally.
   When the same question was asked about congressional
Republicans, 2 percent said poor and lower income, 11 percent said
middle income and 59 percent said upper income.

<HEAD>Marines Make First Callup of Combat Reserves for Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps is ordering the first call-up
of reservists for combat roles in the Persian Gulf crisis, a
Pentagon source said Friday.
   The Marine callup is relatively small and won't add
substantially to the U.S. combat capabilities in the gulf. However,
the Pentagon is considering calling major Army reserve combat units
to active duty, possibly before year's end.
   The Marines will call up individual infantrymen from various
units around the country, not entire units, the source said.
   The New York Times reported Monday that the Pentagon already has
decided to put major reserve combat units on active duty. Maj. Doug
Hart, a Pentagon spokesman, said he was unaware of any such
decision and that no combat units had been activated.
   All of the more than 34,000 reserves from all the armed services
already called to active duty for Operation Desert Shield are being
used in support roles such as truck driving, water purification and
military intelligence. The Marines had accounted for only 200 of
the 34,000 total.
   The Marine infantrymen being called up will be among
approximately 800 reservists in a variety of military jobs being
ordered to report for active duty later this week, the source said.
   The source declined to say how many of the 800 are in combat
roles.
   Use of reserves in combat jobs is politically sensitive because
it can be viewed as putting the country on a wartime footing. No
shots have been fired in the confrontation with Iraq, other than
warnings shots across the bows of ships, but President Bush has not
ruled out the use of force to oust Iraq from occupied Kuwait.
   The Pentagon has been under pressure from some congressional
leaders to use combat reserves. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had
resisted using them, saying the 180-day maximum period of
activation for reserves was too short to make good use of them,
even though some Army three-brigade divisions were designed with
one brigade a reserve brigade.
   Such divisions now in Saudi Arabia took an active duty brigade
from elsewhere in the Army, rather than the so-called ``round-out''
brigades, when they let for the Persian Gulf.
   Congressional concern was erased earlier this month when
Congress, shortly before adjourning, doubled the limit on active
duty service for combat reserves to 360 days.
   It appeared that the Marine combat reserves would become part of
a specially tailored Marine Expeditionary Brigade that eventually
would replace one of several such units already deployed in the
gulf area during a rotation of Marine units.
   Gen. John R. Dailey, the deputy commandant of the Marines, said
in an interview Monday that the rotation plan is mostly complete
but that no decisions have been made on when a rotation of fresh
forces would begin or how they would be structured.

<TEXT>
   Mount St. Helens belched volcanic ash
and steam nearly 6 miles into the air Monday, and the powdery
fallout settled up to 65 miles away in Oregon.
   There were no reports of damage and scientists said they had no
evidence of a bigger eruption in the offing.
   Ashfall from the 8,364-foot mountain 100 miles south of Seattle
was reported as far away as The Dalles, Ore., 65 miles to the
southeast, said geologist Steve Brantley of the U.S. Geological
Survey.
   Residents of neighboring towns were not in any danger,
authorities said.
   The explosion, recorded on volcano seismographs at 2:07 a.m.,
sent a plume of ash 30,000 feet into the air, said Chris
Jonientz-Trisler, a researcher at the University of Washington.
Winds carried the ash plume to the southeast, toward the Columbia
River and into Oregon, the National Weather Service said.
   Jonientz-Trisler said the explosion was ``very minor, minor,
minor'' compared with a May 18, 1980, eruption that leveled 230
square miles of forest, left 57 people dead or missing and sent up
an ash cloud that circled the globe.
   ``This kind of thing is more like the steam and ash explosions
that occurred last winter in December and January,'' she said.
``Any hazards should be fairly confined to the crater.''
   Scientists monitoring the volcano say there has been a gradual
increase in small earthquakes there in the past three years. There
was no evidence, however, that they were associated with Monday's
eruption.
   ``The steam and gases that are involved here could come from a
couple of sources,'' Jonientz-Trisler said. ``It could come from
the magma, bubbling out of solution, or it could be rain and
snowmelt percolating down (to hot areas) and bursting into steam.
It's probably a bit of both processes.''
   In the past, series of earthquakes have occurred in the days
before eruptions of Mount St. Helens.
   The volcano's last large eruption was on March 19, 1982, when
mud flowed from the crater for six miles. Since then, the mountain
has had a series of ``dome-building'' eruptions in which the
mountain adds lava to the heap in its crater. The last one occurred
in October 1986.
   The cataclysmic 1980 eruption blew off the top 1,300 feet of the
once-symmetrical peak, a lava dome dating to about the 16th
century.

   The European Community expressed
concern Monday about the dangers of a catastrophic famine in East
Africa.
   ``The council (of ministers) stressed the very real danger that
the present drought, combined with a persistent difficult political
situation, will lead to famine on a catastrophic scale'' in East
Africa, the final communique read.
   The council of ministers said substantial short-term emergency
food supplies will be necessary in the next few months. It said the
United Nations has estimated that in Sudan as many as 5 million
people are at risk.
   The council urged coordination of help among donors and called
on all EC member nations to make their people aware of the
seriousness of the situation, including ``the Community's concern
about destuuction of refugee camps.''
   Lynda Chalker, British minister for development, said the
situation is even worse than the drought of 1984-85. She said there
was evidence the government in Sudan was covering up cases of
malnutrition.

<HEAD>British Hostages Able to Call Families Over the Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 30 British hostages held in Iraq
telephned their families in Britain last weekend, the Foreign
Office said Monday.
   The Foreign Office condemned the calls as a ``cruel and
calculating Iraqi ploy.''
   Some of the hostages reiterated Iraq's invitation last week for
women to spend Christmas with their husbands, but the Foreign
Office advised families against traveling to Iraq or Kuwait,
occupied since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``Iraqi undertakings should not be trusted,'' a spokesman at the
Foreign Office said, adding that officials realized the advice
would be difficult for some family members to take.
   The calls were placed directly to the families, the Foreign
Office said.
   The family of John Rattenbury spoke for five minutes to the
61-year-old businessman, their first phone call since Aug. 1.
   ``He said they were being well looked after. He was obviously
disappointed that he could not come home with Ted Heath but is
still in good spirits,'' Lilian Rattenbury said.
   Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath traveled to Baghdad
last month and negotiated the release of 37 British hostages who
were elderly or ill.
   Some families received tape-recorded messages from their
husbands, brought back by recently released French hostages, the
Foreign Office said.
   A British hostage said in a taped message he had lost more than
30 pounds on a daily diet of ``one tomato, one onion, one pepper, a
four-inch piece of cucumber and a bit of bread, two pieces of bread
if you are lucky.''
   A Conservative party lawmaker called on families of British
hostages to be brave and stop complaining.
   ``I am sick and tired of the mewling and puking of the relatives
of hostages in the Gulf and of some of the hostages themselves,''
said Sir John Stokes.
   ``During the last war we never heard sobs of widows. Cannot
these people keep a stiff upper lip and think of the country as a
whole?'' Stokes said.
   Dorothy Goodwin, who said she intends to fly to the gulf to
visit her husband, called Stokes' criticism ``unhelpful and
unnecessary.''
   ``He obviously doesn't have any relative trapped in Iraq or he
wouldn't talk that way.''
   The Foreign Office said there are 800 British citizens held in
Iraq.

<HEAD>EC Ministers Suspend Farm Subsidy Talks for One Day</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Community agriculture and
trade ministers late Monday suspended talks on a proposal to cut
farm subsidies until Tuesday to give time for high-level
consultations between EC governments.
   Officials said French President Francois Mitterrand and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl were among the heads of state who would be
talking by phone to try to hammer a final farm plan into shape.
   EC officials expressed guarded optimism that Tuesday's talks
would yield agreement on a proposal that could be submitted to the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
   ``The danger of failure has passed,'' Germany's economics and
trade minister, Helmut Haussmann, said.
   Failure to reach agreement could torpedo the Uruguay Round, a
four-year effort of more than 100 nations to liberalize world
trade.
   The United States and other countries have threatened to abandon
the Geneva-based trade talks if the Community fails t make a
proposal.
   British Agriculture Secretary John Gummer said of the
Community's efforts: ``If we lose this opportunity, I believe it
might have a long-term and very serious effect on the world
economy.''
   The ministers were at odds over a proposal to trim farm
subsidies on major crops by 30 percent over a 10-year period, from
1986 to 1996. Some reductions already have been made.
   France and Germany have insisted on guarantees that their
farmers would not be seriously hurt. The European Commission, the
EC's executive body, drew up a list of guarantees designed to allay
the nations' fears.
   EC ministers failed in six tries last month to reach an accord.
   The Community is the only major participant that has not yet
submitted a proposal to the agricultural trade talks within the
Uruguay Round.
   The talks, held under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, seek to lower trade barriers in 15 areas,
including textiles, manufactured goods and services such as banking
and telecommunications.
   But the United States and other countries insist agriculture is
the key to the talks.

<HEAD>Space Telescope Makes First Spectrum Measurement Of Faint Object</HEAD>

   An instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope
focused on a quasar billions of light years away to make the first
spectral observations of a faint object by the $1.5 billion
orbiting telescope, NASA announced Monday.
   The instrument, a faint object spectrograph, targeted the quasar
known as UM675 in a study of the chemical composition of the early
universe.
   A NASA announcement said that the quasar appears to be receding
from the Earth at a speed of about 80 percent of the speed of
light.
   To make the readings, the space telescope focused on UM675 for
33 minutes in each of three different orbits. A computer at the
Goddard Space Center then combined the data to create a single data
set.
   The readings by the faint object spectrograph were in the far
ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radiation of
this type cannot be detected on Earth because the planet's
atmosphere blocks it, but it can be detected in space.
   Quasars, or ``quasi-stellar objects,'' are puzzling celestial
bodies that emit more energy than would be expected from an objects
of their size. Astronomers study quasars in several spectra in
hopes of understanding their nature.
   Hubble has a focusing problem that seriously affects
instruments, such as cameras, that work only in the visible portion
of the spectrum. The focusing flaw, however, has less effect in the
invisible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

<HEAD>Sir David Stirling, Founder of SAS Special Forces, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Sir David Stirling, who founded Britain's SAS
elite special forces in World War II, has died, his biographer said
Monday. He was 74.
   Stirling died Sunday night in the London Clinic after a long
illness, said Alan Hoe, a former SAS major and Stirling's official
biographer.
   The SAS, or Special Air Service, with its motto ``Who Dares
Wins,'' continued after the war and has kept its reputation for
swift, clandestine and effective action. One highly publicized
exploit was its assault on the Iranian Embassy in London May 5,
1980, to end a siege by gunmen holding hostages.
   Born Archibald David Stirling on Nov. 15, 1915, the son of a
Scottish brigadier general, he joined the Scots Guards at the
outbreak of World War II. Six months later he transferred to No. 3
Commando group of the Brigade of Guards and went with them to the
Middle East.
   He persuaded military authorities that ``an army within an
army'' was needed to make swift, secret raids against the enemy.
They gave him six officers and 60 enlisted men to try out his
theories in the Western Desert.
   Stirling became known as the ``Phantom Major'' among the German
troops of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps after
destroying 250 enemy aircraft and scores of fuel and ammunition
dumps in attacks on the enemy rear.
   His tactics of operating so far behind German lines that his men
could virtually walk into their targets - and then ``retreating''
even farther into enemy territory against all expectations - helped
give him legendary status.
   In 1943, Stirling was taken prisoner in Tunisia. He escaped, was
recaptured and was transferred to Colditz Castle prison camp where
he remained for the rest of the war.
   Stirling left the army on his release, but retained close links
with the regiment. He became head of a series of private armies and
security organizations, many in Africa.
   In 1974, he founded the controversial organization Great Britain
'75, which aimed to keep Britain running in the event of a general
strike, following a devastating mineworkers' industrial action that
year.
   Hoe said Monday: ``The SAS is still based on the same concept of
small, highly trained groups of soldiers being used strategically
rather than tactically.''
   Former chief of the Defense Staff, Field Marshal Lord Bramall,
said Stirling was regarded as founding father of the SAS.
   ``It all started with this young 25-year-old who had this idea
that a few highly trained men inserted at very vulnerable points
could do tremendous damage to the enemy.
   ``It is an immense achievement and he has always been held with
tremendous respect and regard.''
   Stirling was not married. No survivors were reported.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III reached agreement Monday
with Saudi Arabia that if U.S. troops go to battle against Iraq
they will be under American command, a top Bush administration
official said.
   A former West German chancellor meanwhile flew to Iraq to seek
freedom for foreigners held hostage by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein,
and the European Community convened a special session in hopes of
keeping members in line.
   The decision on command and control was announced after Baker
held a two-hour meeting with King Fahd.
   The senior official, who insisted on anonymity, said the Saudis
would play a decisive role because they would share command of
American troops used to defend Saudi Arabia and would have to give
a green light before the 100,000 U.S. troops in the oil-rich
kingdom are sent into action.
   Once the Americans enter battle, U.S. commanders will direct
them, the official said.
   The USS Midway, one of four American aircraft carriers deployed
as part of Operation Desert Shield, entered the Persian Gulf on
Monday. Like the USS Independence, which left the gulf last month
after a few days, the Midway apparently was sent in as a show of
force.
   Later Monday in Washington, a Pentagon source said the Marine
Corps is ordering the first call-up of reservists for combat roles
in the gulf crisis. The Marine call-up is relatively small and will
not add substantially to the estimated 220,000 U.S. forces in the
gulf region.
   However, the Pentagon is considering calling major Army reserve
combat units to active duty, possibly before the end of the year,
the source said.
   Iraq, meanwhile, said that in the event of war over Kuwait, it
would attack Arab countries participating in the U.S.-led
multinational force.
   The latest mission to Baghdad was mounted by former Chancellor
Willy Brandt, who arrived in the Iraqi capital late Monday aboard a
chartered Lufthansa Airbus that can carry about 250 people. Brandt,
who was seen off by Iraq's ambassador to Germany, carried letters
and a bouquet of flowers from relatives of the estimated 400 German
hostages.
   Brandt's mission has the backing of the German government
despite the EC's stand against negotiating for the release of the
hundreds of foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. Saddam has tried to use
the hostages - whom he calls ``guests'' - to splinter the alliance
against him.
   Also Monday, a delegation of Irish legislators left Baghdad
after talks with Iraqi officials aimed at winning freedom for an
estimated 220 Irish citizens.
   ``We are given to believe that the Iraqi government will soon
resolve the issue of Iraqi guests,'' said Irish lawmaker Michael
Higgins.
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan also was
meeting with Iraqi officials in hopes of winning the release of
more than 300 Japanese hostages.
   Diplomatic sources in Baghdad said David Lange, a former prime
minister of New Zealand, and Anker Jorgensen, a former prime
minister of Denmark, plan to come to Iraq.
   Ireland, Germany and Denmark are EC members. A special meeting
of European Community foreign ministers was scheduled in Rome for
Monday night to discuss departures from the EC policy.
   During the weekend, about 50 British and American hostages in
Iraq were allowed to call relatives at home.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher quoted many of
the hostages as saying they had lost weight, that the food was poor
and that they were often cold.
   He added: ``We think if he (Saddam) is genuinely concerned about
allowing husbands and fathers to talk to their wives and children,
he should simply release all the hostages and let them come home.''
   One father said his hostage son told him Britain should not
yield.
   ``He said the telephone call was being recorded but he didn't
give two monkeys and to let the government know that the hostages
want no negotiations with the terrorists and they are 100 percent
behind them,'' the father said. British officials did not identify
the father and son by name.
   But in Brockton, Mass., Mary Trundy said she'll go to Baghdad
for Christmas if it will help her twin brother, John Stevenson. She
said he had called other relatives in Florida, adding: ``We're all
planning to spend the holidays with John.''
   Baker was in Saudi Arabia as part of a seven-nation tour aimed
at testing support among Arabs, Europeans and the Soviets for
military action against Saddam.
   In the Saudi town of Taif, Baker met with the emir of Kuwait,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who was driven from his homeland by
Iraqi invaders Aug. 2.
   ``As far as I am concerned I would like my country to be
liberated today and before tomorrow,'' the emir told reporters.
   Baker said the Persian Gulf crisis ``is entering a new phase,
and while we are still seeking a peaceful political and diplomatic
solution, we have to put ourselves in a position where we would be
able to exercise any options that might be available.''
   While Baker said he had not discussed a military timetable with
the emir, he added: ``I don't think that we can or should ... rule
out resort to force if that should be necessary.''
   In Iraq, the army newspaper Al-Qadissiyah said Arab nations that
join the multinational force would suffer if there is a war.
   ``All dens of evil everywhere, and whoever supported them, would
not be safe from our attacks,'' said the editorial carried by the
official Iraqi News Agency.
   The dispatch monitored in Cyprus said that ``if war occurs as a
result of the U.S.-Western conspiracy and because of traitors such
as (Saudi King) Fahd and (Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak ... our
counterattacks will be destructive and will not be limited to
securing our country's sovereignty.''
   Besides the forces massed by the United States, Britain, France,
Syria, Egypt and Morocco also sent troops to bolster Saudi forces.
   In other developments:
   -Special international aid to countries affected by the gulf
crisis and U.N. embargo on Iraq has reached nearly $13 billion, the
Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination Group announced. Most aid came
from gulf states, and about 80 percent of it will go to Egypt,
Turkey and Jordan.
   -Three French soldiers captured by an Iraqi patrol last week
exceeded their orders by straying too close to Iraq's border with
Saudi Arabia, French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement. He
did not confirm the soldiers strayed into Iraqi territory. The
three returned to France on Sunday.
   -Four fighter jets violated Iraqi airspace Sunday by crossing
the border from Saudi Arabia, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
INA said the intruders, two F-15s and two F-14s, all turned around
shortly after entering Iraqi airspace.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government
narrowly defeated a no-confidence motion in Parliament on Monday,
the second such challenge to his fragile right-wing coalition in
two weeks.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers kept 150,000 Palestinians
under curfew for a third day. One Arab was killed and at least 185
people were wounded by army gunfire during weekend rioting.
   Eight Palestinians and an Israeli soldier were wounded in
continuing clashes in Gaza on Monday, Arab reports said. In one
attack, masked assailants opened fire on soldiers and troops fired
back, but there were no reports of injuries.
   Reporters were barred from Gaza unless under military escort.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens said the unrest ``will not move us
to surrender (control of the occupied lands). ... It will not
influence us.''
   The parliamentary challenge to Shamir was called by seven
opposition parties protesting the government's failure to build
enough housing for an influx of Soviet immigrants.
   A record 120,000 immigrants arrived this year and at least
75,000 more are expected through December. But according to Israeli
reports, fewer than 10,000 new apartments are being built. Much of
the lag is because of bureaucratic infighting among ministries.
   Fueling the anger of left-wingers was a Cabinet decision on
Sunday to give Housing Minister Ariel Sharon a free hand in
distributing lands to contractors. The move was said to be an
attempt to cut through red tape, but critics said it left the door
open to corruption.
   ``All this time nothing has been done and now suddenly you wake
up and see there's no housing, so you take emergency powers to get
things done?'' complained Labor Party legislator Shimon Shitreet on
Israel television.
   ``The mishandling of the immigrants has broken all records ...
lots of panic with no action,'' Avraham Shohat of Labor told
lawmakers.
   Sharon responded by accusing his detractors of trying to delay
efforts to provide housing and seeking to ``deter Russians from
immigrating.''
   ``When I look at the way the opposition benches are acting, a
wave of sympathy engulfs my heart,'' Sharon added.
   Shamir commands 62 seats in the 120-member Knesset, or
parliament. He seemed assured of his majority Monday, until
Interior Minister Aryeh Deri's five-member party threatened to join
the opposition over a squabble involving a scandal investigation.
   Deri's party kept lawmakers in suspense for several hours before
a three-hour debate. The government won the confidence vote 57-50,
with two abstentions. The remaining lawmakers were absent.
   Deri suggested on Israel radio his party was angry with police
handling of a protracted investigation into alleged illegal
handouts of thousands of dollars to religious councils.
   He also said he was also dissatisfied with Israel's ``lack of
flexibility'' toward the United States over Middle East policies
during the Persian Gulf crisis, and the government's heavy hand in
dealing with Palestinians.
   Egypt on Monday blamed Israel for violence in Gaza over the
weekend and urged self-restraint on the part of Israeli forces. The
statement from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said harsh Israeli
measures against Palestinians only ``lead to worldwide
condemnation.''
   Egypt is the only Arab country that has diplomatic relations
with Israel.

   Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is interested
in acting as an intermediary to seek release of Canadians held in
Iraq and Kuwait, Liberal member of Parliament Lloyd Axworthy said
Monday.
   Axworthy said he had not talked to Trudeau personally but used a
go-between to discuss the matter.
   A secretary at the Montreal law firm where Trudeau works said
Trudeau had left for the day, as had Trudeau's secretary.
   Axworthy has been pressing the government to send an official
representative to Iraq to gain the release of about 50 Canadians
held in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   External Affairs Minister Joe Clark repeated Monday that Canada
will have no part of such a mission. He argues that an official
emissary would undermine international efforts to force Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait, which it overran three months ago.

<HEAD>Haitians Fear Violence as Election Officials Rule on Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Tension mounted in Haiti on Monday,
the eve of a ruling on whether supporters of the Duvalier
dictatorship that terrorized the country for nearly three decades
can run in the December elections.
   The Electoral Council was expected Tuesday to ban at least three
Duvalierists from participating, and many Haitians worried such a
ruling could unleash a wave of violent retaliation as it did in
1987.
   ``November evokes for some a vision of apocalypse,'' Jean
Dominique, director of the independent Radio Haiti-Inter, said in a
radio commentary. ``In 1987, disqualified candidates put an already
devastated country to the torch.''
   As night fell Monday on the capital of Port-au-Prince, where
more than 1 million people live, huge traffic jams formed as
Haitians stocked up on supplies and food in case of violence.
   After the council barred 12 Duvalierist candidates from the 1987
race, dozens of people were killed. Five radio stations were
riddled with machine-gun fire and put out of commission.
   On Election Day, goon squads in collusion with the army hacked
and shot to death at least 34 voters at the polls. The government
then canceled the election.
   This year's elections are set for Dec. 16. The campaign
officially begins Wednesday and runs until Dec. 14.
   The Electoral Council has constitutional authority to decide on
the eligibility of the candidates. The 1987 constitution bars
``architects'' of the Duvalier dictatorship from running for
office.
   Of this year's 26 presidential candidates, four are avowed
Duvalierists.
   Adding to tensions is the candidacy of the Rev. Bertrand
Aristide, an ardent foe of Duvalierists and the military who has
survived at least three assassination attempts.
   Many fear violent confrontations between Duvalierists and his
supporters. A liberation theology advocate who believes the Church
should be involved in the social struggles of the poor, Aristide,
37, was ousted from his Roman Catholic Salesian Order in 1988 for
allegedly inciting violence with his fiery sermons.
   He is believed to have a mass following among Haiti's poor, a
majority in this Caribbean nation of 6 million people.
   The most feared Duvalierist candidate is Roger Lafontant, who
ran the private Tonton Macoute militia that kept the Duvalier
family in power for 29 years.
   The dictatorship ended in February 1986 when Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled into exile, but Haiti has been wracked by political
turmoil since he was toppled.
   The current provisional government of Ertha Pascal-Trouillot,
appointed in March, is the fifth since Duvalier fell.
   There is a warrant for Lafontant's arrest charging him with
conspiring against national security. But it has not been served
and he's thought to have military support. Lafontant returned to
Haiti in July after nearly five years in voluntary exile.
   Two other Duvalierists candidates, former army chief of staff
Claude Raymond and Clemard Joseph Charles, a banker, were barred
from the 1987 elections.
   Remy Joseph, a doctor who was health minister under Duvalier, is
regarded as a moderate and is expected to be allowed in the race.
   About 800 observers from the United Nations and Organization of
American States are expected to monitor the elections.

   Candidates for Congress and 36 governor's seats made their final
campaign rounds Monday amid signs of extraordinary voter
dissatisfaction but without any indication of a looming
anti-incumbent landslide on Election Day.
   Democrats were confident they would retain their majorities in
both houses of the new 102nd Congress, and nary a Republican
disputed their claim.
   The GOP hoped to counter with victories in the big-state
gubernatorial races.
   Buddy MacKay, a Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in
Florida, spoke for nervous candidates everywhere when he declared,
``I'm not saying the race is over. Anything can still happen.'' His
running mate, gubernatorial candidate Lawton Chiles, was leading in
the late polls.
   Overall, pollsters and analysts said Tuesday isn't likely to
bring a thorough house-cleaning of the political establishment.
   ``Americans are very dissatisfied with the way things are going
in this country,'' and mention economic concerns more than any
other, said Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll.
   Still, he said, in an assessment shared by others, ``It's not
necessarily clear we're going to have a massive
get-rid-of-the-incumbent'' outcome.
   Fresh evidence of voter dissatisfaction emerged in an ABC News
poll, which reported that 77 percent of those surveyed believe the
economy is getting worse, and only 4 percent believe it is getting
better.
   The White House dispatched drug policy director William Bennett
to North Carolina to campaign for GOP Sen. Jesse Helms, a
three-term conservative in a tight race with Harvey Gantt, a black
former mayor.
   ``Race is not an issue in this campaign,'' said Helms, who has
accused Gantt of supporting job quotas based on race. ``We have not
made an issue of race, but he has gone around the state pleading
for the bloc vote.''
   But the Justice Department sent a team of lawyers to North
Carolina after Democrats charged that the state GOP was trying to
intimidate black voters.
   The state GOP sent out postcards advising voters that they were
ineligible to cast ballots if they had moved in the last 30 days.
The statement on the cards is misleading, said a Justice Department
official. Democrats said the postcards were targeted to heavily
black precincts.
   The state GOP has pledged not to use any information it obtained
from returned postcards to challenge the eligibility of voters at
the polls on Tuesday, said the Justice Department.
   Gantt dreamed of the upset that would make him a national
figure: ``How sweet it's going to be.''
   In final rallies, he stressed how important it is to ``care
about our children, to care about the environment, to care about
health care, to care about the human condition.''
   In the biggest state of all, GOP candidate Pete Wilson embarked
on a five-city tour of California, tagging Democratic rival Dianne
Feinstein as soft on crime and a big spender.
   Countered Ms. Feinstein, trailing in the polls, ``For eight
years they (the Republicans) have taken us in the wrong direction.
For eight years we've had uncontrolled growth, increasing crime and
declining schools.''
   In all, 34 Senate seats are on Tuesday's ballot, a new
435-member House will be chosen and three dozen governors will be
elected. More than 6,000 legislative races, local contests and a
healthy assortment of initiatives complete the ballots.
   The legislative races, in particular, were drawing more interest
than usual from the national parties. Both sides want the
legislatures on their side when states redraw the boundaries of
U.S. House seats to reflect population shifts detected in the 1990
Census.
   President Bush on Monday spent his second straight day in Texas
stumping for gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams and other GOP
candidates - ``every single one of them.''
   Democrat Ann Richards launched a new radio advertisement taking
aim at millionaire Williams' admission that he paid no income taxes
in 1986.
   ``Millions of average Texans paid taxes, while (Williams) took
advantage of loopholes for the rich,'' her ad said. Williams says
he paid no taxes because he lost money when oil prices tumbled.
   Her supporters passed out buttons reading, ``I paid my taxes in
'86.'' She nicknamed her opponent ``Mucho Dinero.''
   Newport said a late-October poll found that only 24 percent of
those surveyed approved of the job Congress was doing. Yet 61
percent said they approved of the job performance of their own
representative.
   He noted that despite a precipitous drop in Bush's approval
ratings in October, the president still is well above 50 percent
and the trend is up.
   Democrats control the current Senate, 55-45, and most estimates
were for little, if any, change in the lineup.
   The closest Senate races appeared to be North Carolina and
Hawaii, where appointed Sen. Daniel Akaka faced a stiff challenge
from Republican Rep. Patricia Saiki.
   Final pre-election polls pointed to new terms for Republicans
Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, both of
whom hurried home from Washington in October to confront
unexpectedly strong challenges.
   Democrats were nervous about incumbents Claiborne Pell of Rhode
Island; Tom Harkin of Iowa and John Kerry of Massachusetts. But
they harbored hopes of defeating GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell in
Kentucky.
   In the House, most estimates were for a gain of roughly 10 seats
for the Democrats,who hold a 258-175 edge with two vacancies.
   The Illinois gubernatorial battle between Democratic Attorney
General Neil Hartigan and Republican Secretary of State Jim Edgar
defied prediction.
   The final polls gave Republican George Voinovich the edge in his
bid to claim the Ohio governorship for the Republicans.
   Two independents - both of them former Republicans - were making
strong gubernatorial bids, Lowell Weicker in Connecticut and Wally
Hickel in Alaska.

   Senate incumbents worked to shore up their
leads in the final rush toward Election Day and only the races in
North Carolina and Hawaii remained tossups in the polls.
   Voters in 34 states elect senators on Tuesday and Democrats
appeared to be in no danger of losing their control of the Senate,
now split 55-45 in their favor.
   Most observers predicted the Senate would shift only a seat or
two in either direction, but that didn't dampen the intensity with
which candidates were competing for votes in races across the
country.
   Fights broke out over the weekend between supporters of
three-term incumbent Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and backers of
challenger of Harvey Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte. Polls
differed as to who was ahead.
   In no other states were voters being offered so clear a choice -
Helms, a leader of the right wing of the Republican party, and
Gantt, an unabashed liberal who is black.
   Helms accused Gantt of supporting racial quotas but denied
Monday that he made race an issue in the campaign.
   ``We have not made an issue of race, but he has gone around the
state pleading for the bloc vote. He has a right to do that. But
that has injected race into it,'' said Helms. He toured the state
with President Bush's drug czar, William Bennett, in tow.
   Gantt told supporters if Helms wanted to call him a liberal,
fine. ``If you care about people, you can call me a liberal,''
Gantt said.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department sent a team of lawyers to
North Carolina after Democrats charged that the state GOP was
trying to intimidate black voters.
   The state GOP sent out postcards advising voters that they were
ineligible to cast ballots if they had moved in the last 30 days.
The statement on the cards is misleading, said a Justice Department
official. Democrats said the postcards were targeted to heavily
black precincts.
   The state GOP pledged not to use any information it obtained
from returned postcards to challenge the eligibility of voters at
the polls on Tuesday, said the Justice Department.
   In Hawaii, the differences between the candidates were less
dramatic, and the campaigning much more genteel. Incumbent
Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka was fighting for election to the seat
to which he was appointed last spring.
   The islands are overwhelmingly Democratic, and so Akaka's
challenger, moderate Republican Rep. Pat Saiki, is asking Democrats
to cross over on Tuesday. She pointed over the weekend to the fact
that Sen. Daniel Inouye, Hawaii's senior Democratic senator, was
supporting Oregon Republican Mark Hatfield's re-election bid.
   Hatfield was ahead in the polls, although not safely out of
reach of Democrat Harry Lonsdale, a businessman and scientist.
After six terms in the Senate, Hatfield enjoyed support from a huge
array of fellow politicians. Lonsdale was in striking range largely
because of his ads portraying Hatfield as too much the insider.
   Similar themes mark the contest in Kentucky between incumbent
Mitch McConnell, a first-term Republican, and Democrat Harvey
Sloane.
   Another insider-outsider campaign is in Minnesota, where GOP
incumbent Rudy Boschwitz was favored to win re-election over
Democratic upstart Paul Wellstone, a college professor.
   In one of the more unusual campaign pitches this fall, the
Boschwitz campaign sent a letter to the Minnesota Jewish community
pointing out that while both men are Jewish, Wellstone had married
a non-Jew and was not raising his children in the religion.
   Wellstone on Sunday called the letter ``unforgivable ... the
most personal attack of all.''
   Personal attacks have been routine in the Senate campaigns this
year.
   In Massachusetts, incumbent Democrat John Kerry responded to
Republican Jim Rappaport's attacks by running a series of ads
raising questions about Rappaport's personal finances.
   In New Hampshire, Democratic John Durkin accused Republican
Robert Smith of being in the pocket of the ``Japs,'' because his
campaign was being assisted by independent advertising from
Japanese auto dealers.
   New Hampshire, Idaho and Colorado are the three states where
incumbents senators are retiring this year. In all three,
Republicans are expected to retain control of the seats.
   In Iowa, incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin is trying to become the
first Democrat in that state ever re-elected to the Senate. His
Republican challenger, Rep. Tom Tauke, was less than 10 points
behind in the latest polls.
   Other incumbents nursing uncertain leads into the final days
were Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who faced Republican Rep.
Claudine Schneider, and Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., who was being
challenged by businessman Ted Muenster in another
throw-the-rascals-out effort.

   A senior Communist leader who was
believed to have helped plan the 1989 killing of a U.S. Army
colonel was arrested on a suburban street, the military announced
Monday.
   Reynaldo Bernardo, alleged deputy commander and intelligence
chief of the New People's Army in the Manila area, was arrested
Sunday as he was waiting for a ride in Quezon City, according to
Maj. Gen. Guillermo Flores, chief of the Philippine army.
   Flores said Bernardo was involved in the planning of the April
21, 1989, killing of U.S. Army Col. James Rowe, who was gunned down
on his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in
Quezon City.
   Rowe, a counterinsurgency expert, spent eight years as a
prisoner of the Viet Cong until he escaped.
   Flores said Bernardo was ``deeply involved in the selection of
quality targets'' for assassination by the Manila-based Alex
Boncayao Brigade.
   The brigade has claimed responsibility for the killing of more
than 300 troops and civilians in the capital since it was
established in 1984. It also claimed responsibility for burning
passenger buses during last month's labor strike for higher wages.
   Flores said the initial confusion over identity resulted because
Bernardo was a ``relatively new personality'' in the underground
``who rose from the ranks.''
   The New People's Army has waged a 21-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state in the Philippines.
   At least five other senior officials of the outlawed Communist
Party of the Philippines have been arrested in Manila this year.
   In another development, the military said six rebels and one
soldier were killed in a series of clashes on Samar island since
last Tuesday.
   Samar, the third largest of the 7,100 Philippine islands, is a
longtime rebel stronghold.

   The Justice Department sent lawyers to North
Carolina on Monday to try to ensure that black voters aren't
disqualified at the polls with information gathered by the state
Republican Party.
   Assistant Attorney General John R. Dunne said the state GOP has
pledged not to use any information it obtained from returned
postcards to challenge the eligibility of voters at the polls on
Tuesday.
   Democrats charged the GOP sent out the postcards to intimidate
black voters and discourage them from casting ballots the
neck-and-neck race between GOP Sen. Jesse Helms and former
Charlotte mayor Harvey Gantt, who is black.
   In addition, Democrats feared that in cases where the postcards
were returned to the state GOP as non-deliverable, indicating that
someone had moved, the party might challenge those people at the
polls if they tried to vote.
   Dunne said a team of Justice Department lawyers would be in the
state Tuesday to consult with election officials and, if necessary,
seek court injunctions to prevent the misuse of information from
the postcards.
   The postcards advised voters that they were ineligible to cast
ballots if they had moved in the last 30 days. Officials feared
that if the returned postcards were used to challenge eligibility
it would place an unfair burden of proof on voters.
   ``In our judgment, the statement on the cards was misleading if
not totally inaccurate,'' Dunne said.
   Dunne said the investigation began last Friday, a day after
Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown charged in a letter that the
North Carolina GOP had sent postcards bearing misleading and false
information to residents of heavily black precincts.
   Brown's hand-delivered letter demanded an investigation by the
Justice Department's civil rights division.
   The charge was made as race flared as an issue Helms' bid to
defeat a stiff challenge from Gantt.
   Helms has accused Gantt of favoring racial job quotas and he is
airing an advertisement showing the hands of a white job applicant
crushing a rejection letter. The announcer states that the job went
to a minority applicant to fulfill a hiring quota.
   The votes of blacks in North Carolina are considered a crucial
ingredient in Gantt's efforts to unseat Helms, a three-term
conservative Republican.
   Dunne said the investigation determined that the postcards had
been ``disseminated on a fairly broad basis.''
   Earlier in the day, a federal judge in Newark, N.J., held that
the Republican National Committee was not involved in the North
Carolina mailings, which Democrats charged violated a 1982 consent
decree signed by the national GOP.
   FBI agents spent the weekend interviewing state party officials
and two Justice Department voting rights lawyers were dispatched to
North Carolina on Monday to pursue the investigation. Others were
being sent to join them, Dunne said.
   ``We will continue to look at the whole scheme that was
utilized'' to determine if any civil rights violation occurred,
Dunne said. ``What we were concerned about in the short term was
countering any negative or deterring effect these cards might
have.''
   The investigation so far has determined that the postcards were
mailed to voters in 29 different counties, though Dunne said the
department had not had an opportunity to verify the Democratic
charge that they were targeted to heavily black precincts.
   Dunne said investigators were compiling a list of the precincts
``for the specific purpose of advising our team what to look for.''
   Dunne said a large number of mailings were made in Mecklenburg
County, near Charlotte. Some were also reported in Edgecombe
County, in eastern North Carolina where 36 federal officials had
already been sent to observe the election.
   The North Carolina Republican Party has turned over documents
from the mailing campaign to the Justice Department. Dunne said
evidence of any violations could be used to pursue a civil suit.
   He stressed that there was no evidence of any criminal
violations of civil rights laws.
   Republicans had dismissed the Democrats's complaint about the
mailings as ``much ado about nothing.''
   ``It's merely an effort to ensure that it's a fair, honest
election,'' Rick Shelby, political director of the National
Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee said last week.
   Jack Hawke, the North Carolina GOP chairman, last week defended
the postcards, saying ``the only people who received a mailing from
us are those that are improperly registered.''

<HEAD>Imprisoned Irish Revolutionary Denied Bail</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused to set bail Monday for
Joseph Doherty, who for seven years has fought deportation for the
1980 slaying of an army officer in Northern Ireland.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum rejected Doherty's
request for bail, saying he was likely to flee if released.
   Doherty, 35, was arrested in New York in 1983. He faces a life
sentence for the 1980 slaying of a British officer killed in a
gunfight between British troops and Doherty's four-man Irish
Republican Army unit.
   Doherty has never been charged with a crime in the United States
and has been held without bail since his arrest. He has said he
quit the IRA before coming to the United States in1982.
   ``The evidence is overwhelming that petitioner, if released,
would pose such a substantial risk of flight that no condition of
bail could reasonably assure his surrender for deportation,''
Cedarbaum said in her decision.
   Doherty escaped from prison in Northern Ireland in 1981 and hid
in this country with help from Americans sympathetic to his cause,
she said.
   While conceding that the length of detention was ``extremely
troubling,'' the judge rejected Doherty's contention that his
lengthy imprisonment violated his constitutional rights.
   The judge said many constitutional protections did not apply to
aliens in deportation proceedings.
   Doherty's lawyer, Mary Pike, said she would appeal the ruling.
   ``There is something very ominous in the notion that an
individual who is unconvicted of any crime can be imprisoned for in
excess of seven years,'' Pike said.
   The Irish-American community has rallied around Doherty, naming
him honorary grand marshal of St. Patrick's Day parades around the
country and sending him thousands of letters of support.
   Dozens of politicians and religious leaders have visited him in
prison. The city also gave his name to a street near the facility.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and unite the province - where Protestants outnumber Roman
Catholics by a 3-2 margin - with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in Northern Ireland
since political and sectarian violence erupted in 1969.

   The leader of the Ukrainian Catholic Church,
Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky, said Monday he will visit his
homeland in April for the first time since leaving in 1937.
   The church was legalized last month after more than 40 years of
suppression.
   Lubachivsky, 76, who is based in Rome, said he was invited by
the City Council of Lvov. Exact dates of the trip will be announced
later.
   Lubachivsky, who holds the title of major-archbishop of Lvov,
said, ``I cannot express my happiness at being able to return.''
   An estimated 4 million or more Catholics live in the Ukraine.
   Lubachivsky left when the Ukraine was under Polish occupation.
The pope appointed him metropolitan-archbishop of Philadelphia in
1979 and made him cardinal six years later. He is a U.S. citizen.

   Authorities in northern Bohemia,
the most polluted region of Czechoslovakia, have started
distributing respiratory masks to protect children while outdoors,
the state CTK news agency reported Monday.
   The masks are similar to surgical masks, but contain filters.
They fit over the mouth and nose and are meant to be worn by
children and teachers while on their way to school and during
outdoor activities, CTK said.
   Local authorities in the county of Most, about 50 miles
northwest of Prague, plan to provide about 10,000 of the masks, the
agency said. About 13,000 preschool children are also to be
outfitted.
   The costs will be paid by one of the biggest polluters in the
county, the Chemical Works of Litvinov, the agency said.

<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin said Monday he
vetoed the promotion of two army generals recommended by Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, his predecessor and still army commander.
   Aylwin refused to discuss his reasons, but he told an
interviewer on state TV he expects the army to accept his decision
``without any problems.''
   ``Constitutionally, my decision cannot be contested. The armed
forces must be obedient,'' he said.
   The army and Pinochet have not commented.
   The president acknowledged that Pinochet finds it difficult to
accommodate to his new ``subordinate position'' as army commander
after ruling Chile ``as an absolute master'' for almost 17 years.
   Pinochet seized power in a military coup in 1973. He handed the
presidency over to Aylwin, an elected civilian, last March.
   Under a constitutional clause written by Pinochet's military
regime, he remained army chief and Aylwin cannot fire him.
   Aylwin said he vetoed the promotions to major general of Carlos
Parera and Ramon Castro, two brigadier generals considered staunch
Pinochet loyalists.
   The president said he approved all the promotions suggested by
the chiefs of the navy, air force and national police, because they
previously discussed them with Defense Minister Patricio Rojas.
Pinochet, he added, ``chose to make the proposal without any
consultations whatsoever.''

   Bombs set off by Maoist Shining Path
guerrillas killed two policemen and seriously injured 20 people in
the capital and two major cities, police said Monday.
   The attacks came in response to the government's lifting of the
state of emergency in the Andean city of Ayacucho where the
guerrillas began their insurgency in 1980.
   Rebels late Sunday shot to death two policemen in Lima, police
said. The killings followed a bombing attack the same night on the
U.S. consulate, which broke several windows but caused no
casualties.
   The Shining Path early Sunday lobbed two grenades at police and
soldiers in the main square of Ayacucho, seriously injuring 17
members of the armed forces and two civilians, police said Monday.
   The government lifted the state of emergency Oct. 24 in
Ayacucho, a departmental capital 230 miles southeast of Lima and
the birthplace of the Shining Path.
   In the coastal city of Trujillo, 305 miles north of Lima, rebels
Sunday detonated a car bomb outside government health offices and
dynamited state telecommunications offices, seriously injuring a
guard, police said Monday.
   The rebels downed electricity towers outside Trujillo, causing a
temporary blackout, police said.
   Bomb experts Sunday decativated two explosives in Arequipa, a
tourist haven 465 miles southeast of Lima, police said Monday.
   More than 20,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path took up arms 10 years ago.

<HEAD>Brando Murder Case on Verge of Trial as Daughter Recovers From

<TEXT>
   The murder trial of Marlon Brando's
son was delayed indefinitely Monday by an appeals court decision to
review the status of Brando's daughter, who is recovering from a
drug overdose in Tahiti.
   Cheyenne Brando, 20, is the key witness to events that led to
the shooting death of her 26-year-old lover, Dag Drollet, at the
actor's home on May 16. Brando's son, Christian, 32, had been
scheduled to go on trial Monday for first-degree murder.
   Miss Brando fled to Tahiti a month after the killing, gave birth
to Drollet's child and had refused to return to California to
testify. Authorities in Tahiti also have barred her exit, charging
her as an accomplice in Drollet's murder.
   The legal tangle over her testimony led to a last-minute stay.
Prosecutors say they can't win the case without her testimony.
   The state's 2nd District Court of Appeal issued a brief ruling
late Monday upholding the stay and ordering legal briefs to be
submitted by Brando's attorney on Nov. 13, with responding briefs
from the prosecution on Nov. 19.
   ``The trial is on hold,'' said district attorney spokeswoman
Sandi Gibbons.
   The three-member appeals panel said it would decide the issues
on the basis of written documents. However, the court left the door
open for the lower court to reconsider its role in prosecution
efforts to force Miss Brando to return from Tahiti and testify.
   The main dispute is whether a California court can issue an
international letter seeking official help from French authorities
to arrange Miss Brando's testimony.
   Judges in Superior and federal courts have refused to rule,
saying they lacked jurisdiction in the international matter. But
the appeals court said the Superior Court could take up the
question again.
   On Thursday night, Miss Brando was rushed to a Tahitian hospital
in a coma. By Friday, she awakened and was reported to be
recovering from a drug overdose.
   Cheyenne's troubled life has been a subplot to the Brando affair
from the start. She is said to be emotionally disturbed, addicted
to drugs and still suffering effects of a near-fatal auto accident
in 1989.
   She was seven months pregnant when Marlon Brando dialed 911 to
tell police there had been a shooting at his mansion.
   Prosecutors say Christian Brando decided to kill Drollet because
he had been physically abusing his sister.
   Defense attorney Robert Shapiro said Christian Brando and
Drollet fought over a gun that accidentally went off.
   Miss Brando's version of events has never been clear. She has
given at least five depositions in the United States and Tahiti,
but Shapiro says they have contained conflicting accounts.
   Marlon Brando, who wept last month when he spoke of his
daughter's plight, flew to Tahiti Friday to be with her. He is
expected to testify at the trial.

   Democrat Dianne Feinstein took a shot at
male-run government and Republican Pete Wilson got a bracing hand
from Ronald Reagan in the final rounds Monday in their $40 million
bout for governor.
   The candidates, both 57, spent the day repeating their basic
themes and exhorting volunteers to bring California's 13.5 million
registered voters to the polls to decide a race expected to be
close.
   If Wilson, the junior senator from California, had help from the
former president and California governor, Feinstein, the former
mayor of San Francisco, had her own celebrity booster the last day
on the hustings: comedian Chevy Chase.
   Wilson began the day in Sacramento and made the rounds of
rallies from San Jose to his hometown of San Diego, including two
appearances with Reagan.
   Feinstein campaigned from San Diego to San Francisco, also
finishing up on home turf.
   Much is at stake in winning the top job in the country's most
populous state.
   The Republican Party nationally was hoping to install one of
their own as governor to block a Democrat-engineered
reapportionment. When political boundaries are redrawn, as they
always are after a national census, the state's 45-member
congressional delegation is expected to grow to 52.
   Democrats also want to take back control of the governor's
office after eight years in GOP hands.
   In Mission Viejo, Reagan urged 2,500 Republicans to vote for
Wilson to protect Republican interests.
   ``If we don't elect Pete Wilson as governor, our opponents will
gerrymander those (district) lines as they have been doing for half
a century and draw them to elect more Democrats to Sacramento and
Washington,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan was a bit off on his history. Democrats controlled
California reapportionment in the 1960s and 1980s. But Republicans
controlled it in the 1950s. Then, in the 1970s, the state Supreme
Court approved new districts after Reagan, then governor, and the
Democratic controlled Legislature deadlocked.
   The candidates hit hard at each other wherever they went.
   Wilson depicted Feinstein as a soft-on-crime, fiscally
irresponsible executive. Feinstein characterized Wilson as a
protect-the-wealthy conservative with little empathy for
wage-earners.
   Feinstein hammered on Wilson's vote against the Civil Rights
Act. Wilson accused Feinstein of trying to divide Californians
along racial and class lines.
   This election may decide not only the next governor, but the
political future for Feinstein, the first woman to wage a
major-party campaign for governor of California.
   ``I say we've had enough of the blue suits,'' Feinstein told 500
students at the University of California, Davis. ``It's time to try
a skirt.''
   ``The Republicans want us to reward them for the fiscal decline
of the 1980s,'' she told a Santa Monica rally of 150 supporters.
   ``For eight years they have taken us in the wrong direction, for
eight years we've had uncontrolled growth, increasing crime and
declining schools,'' she said.
   ``There will be no Democratic gerrymander,'' Wilson told 200
backers in Sacramento.
   He said Feinstein's accusation that he is beholden to wealthy,
special interests, leaves her ``sounding much more like
(Massachusetts Gov. Michael) Dukakis. ... It doesn't sell.''
   Speaking of selling, between them, Feinstein and Wilson have
spent about $40 million on their campaigns since last year, mostly
for television advertising.

   Flags fluttered at half-staff Monday
across Mary Martin's Never-Never Land.
   It was here, in a still gracious Victorian country home, that
the beloved Broadway star was born 76 years ago and where she
returned often during a career that won her worldwide renown.
   Martin, one of the New York theater's leading ladies for more
than 30 years, died of cancer Saturday at her home in Rancho
Mirage, Calif.
   The newspaper in this town about 30 miles west of Fort Worth
memorialized her Monday with a front-page drawing of a smiling
Martin and a crying Tinker Bell crouched in the corner.
   Critically acclaimed and widely admired for her roles in a
number of blockbuster musicals, it was a tune called ``My Heart
Belongs to Daddy'' that launched her career, and it was her stage
and screen renditions of ``Peter Pan'' that made her famous.
   And she brought the magic of both back home, in her own special
way.
   In her book, ``My Heart Belongs,'' she honored her hometown with
a chapter titled ``My Heart Belongs to Weatherford,'' and she
reminded the folks of that in 1983 when she was here to receive
many honors.
   On July 4, 1976, America's 200th birthday, Martin came home to
unveil Ronald Thomason's statue of Peter Pan that was being placed
in front of the Weatherford Public Library in memory of her
parents.
   Quoting from her most famous role, she said: ``I have a place
where dreams are born and time is never planned; it's not on any
chart, you must find it with your heart, Never-Never Land.''
   Weatherford, she said, was her Never-Never Land.
   On Monday, the home at 414 W. Lee St. had two pumpkins and a
wooden swing on the front porch, a ``For Sale'' sign in the front
yard and a family of admirers occupying the rambling, five-bedroom,
turn-of-the-century dwelling. ``Everyone loved her,'' said Molly
Carpenter, who has lived in the house eight years with her husband
Jim and two daughters. The family is getting preparing to move to
nearby Fort Worth.
   ``She was a remarkable person and part of this town,'' she said.
``You could stand in the middle of the street and scream, `Who's a
fan of Mary Martin's?' and they'd come pouring out of their
doors.''
   Mrs. Carpenter said she met Martin's son, ``Dallas'' star Larry
Hagman, many times, but the Broadway star herself only once, when
she came back to Weatherford for the funeral of a friend.
   About three years ago, Martin had a friend take her picture in
front of the house.
   She sent the Carpenters a copy which said: ``To the Carpenters,
in the house where I was born. With love, Mary Martin.''
   The flag at the old brick post office flew at half-staff Monday,
as did others scattered about the city of some 15,000 residents.
   Old friends remembered Martin as much for her close ties to
Weatherford as for her legendary star status.
   However, Marge Ashcroft, a high school classmate of Martin's,
told the Weatherford Democrat she keeps thinking of the scene in
``Peter Pan'' where he encourages the audience to clap their hands
to bring back a fading Tinker Bell.
   ``It kind of makes us want to clap our hands to bring her
back,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush signed a $492 billion
deficit-reduction package into law Monday night, a reluctant
election-eve reminder to voters of pending tax increases.
   Bush delayed signing the controversial budget package until 8:20
p.m. (9:20 p.m. EST), beating a midnight EST deadline when
temporary spending authority was to expire. The tortured passage
last month of the package, which includes $140 billion in tax
increases as well as significant cuts in government spending,
plunged Bush's administration into disarray and crippled his
once-high approval ratings.
   The president, who spent the day campaigning on behalf of
Republican candidates in Texas, also signed the 13 appropriations
bills that provide money for the government for the next 11 months.
   Bush wound up five days of political travel urging voters to
``get out there and vote,'' ending a midterm election campaign
marked by mixed messages and squabbling among his advisers.
   The budget package caused the president considerable political
damage within his own party, and White House advisers had worked
hard to move voters' attention off the budget fiasco.
   Camaigning in his adoptive home state, the president sought to
emphasize positive election-eve themes, acting on a recommendation
from some advisers to look more ``presidential.''
   In the final days leading up to Tuesday's midterm elections,
Bush has been buffeted by conflicting recommendations from senior
advisers about how to make the best of his falling popularity, said
aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   After Bush found that the slumping economy and his wavering
positions on tax and budget issues were not playing well to
Republican audiences, he first embarked on a blistering attack on
Democrats - blaming them for shoving new tax increases down his
throat.
   Aides said that the Democrat-bashing approach, primarily urged
by Bush's combative chief of staff, John Sununu, appeared to be
backfiring.
   According to sources, Bush's former pollster, Robert Teeter, and
his 1988 media consultant, Roger Ailes, bypassed Sununu last week
and persuaded Bush to lighten up and to stress positive themes.
   One official said that Bush's apparent wavering on themes over
the past few days did not reflect shift of positions as much as
conflicting advice.
   As Bush's political sights began to refocus toward his own 1992
re-election effort, the president also vented his frustration at
commentaries on his diminished popularity and the mood of the
electorate.
   At a GOP rally in Tyler, Bush lashed out at ``the cynics, these
Washington pundits that we see on these tiring shows all the
time.''
   ``I don't know if you're like me, maybe you've enjoyed these
things. But I can only take so much self-flagellation,'' Bush
declared.
   ``Don't tell me what's wrong with this country, show us what's
right about it,'' he asserted, with GOP gubernatorial candidate
Clayton Williams at his side.
   At a rally in Waco, Bush raised the spectre of former President
Jimmy Carter, saying ``I get so tired'' of contentions that
``there's a great malaise about the political process.''
   Bush also continued his barrage against Saddam Hussein,
demanding the Iraqi leader withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``Unchecked and uncontrolled aggression could be world war
tomorrow,'' he said.
   At a final campaign gala in Houston, the presence of three or
four protesters shouting ``No war for oil'' gave bush an entry into
one of his favorite lines - that the U.S. military buildup in Saudi
Arabia is not to secure oil, but to oppose ``naked aggression.''
The protesters were hustled out of the room.
   Bush was to vote in Houston on Tuesday before returning to
Washington.
   As Bush and his wife Barbara campaigned across Texas, the
Massachusetts-born and Connecticut-raised president boasted of
their longtime ties to the state.
   ``I am a Texan and I am proud of it and I know Texas quality
when I see it,'' Bush told his Tyler audience. He noted he had
voted in Texas in ``every election since 1948.''
   By any account, Bush's participation in the midterm elections
has been remarkable - attending 115 political fund raisers and
rallies as president and raising nearly $90 million for Republicans
over the last year and a half.
   What would it take for Bush to declare a victory for
Republicans? ``I expect he'll claim victory, no matter what
happens,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.

   Democrats filed a complaint Monday with the
Federal Election Commission, alleging that a group headed by
evangelist Pat Robertson had failed to report spending against
Democratic House candidates in four states.
   Robertson rejected the suggestion that the group has failed to
meet federal requirements.
   The complaint alleged that Robertson's Christian Coalition has
been buying radio spots and sending mail opposing Democratic
candidates in at least four House districts, ``criticizing, and
often distorting, their voting records.''
   The documents filed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee named incumbent Reps. Ben Jones of Georgia, Pat Williams
of Montana, Richard Stallings of Idaho and Jolene Unsoeld of
Washington. Unsoeld and Jones, both freshmen, are locked in
cliffhanger re-election races.
   In a radio spot aimed at Williams, the group contends that the
lawmaker ``wants to raise our taxes to pay for pornography.''
Williams has been a prominent defender of the National Endowment
for the Arts against attacks by conservatives who say it funds
obscene art.
   Letters addressed, ``Dear Christian Friend,'' went into Jones'
district making similar allegations and asking for money for the
Christian Coalition.
   Organizations which spend money to promote or defeat candidates
on their own, without coordinating with the candidates' own
campaigns, are allowed unlimited spending but must register with
the FEC and report their activities and the sources of their money.
   The group has failed to do so, the DCCC charged.
   The coalition isn't urging the defeat or election of any
candidate and the radio spots constitute a public education
campaign, said Frankie Abourjilie, a spokeswoman for Robertson. The
spots suggest that listeners write the candidates and tell them how
they feel about the issues.
   ``It is incredible that some members of Congress don't want to
face voters on critical issues such as taxes and how those tax
dollars are spent,'' Robertson said in a statement through
Abourjilie.
   ``Our interest is in securing votes against tax-funded
pornography,'' the coalition's executive director, Ralph Reed, said
last week.
   The Christian Coalition was formed as a non-profit, evangelical
organization by Robertson, a religious broadcaster and 1988
Republican presidential candidate. Its literature says it is not
affiliated with any political party and doesn't endorse candidates.
   But Coalition director Ralph Reed, in a Nov. 1 appearance on
Robertson's ``700 Club'' television program, said the group was
distributing voter guides in hopes of increasing turnout and

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court carved out a one-man
exception to the military services' ban on homosexuals Monday,
letting stand a ruling that forces the Army to re-enlist a gay
soldier.
   The justices, without comment, rejected the Bush
administration's challenge to the ordered reinstatement of Perry
Watkins of Tacoma, Wash., a 16-year veteran with an excellent
service record.
   Monday's action is not expected to affect in any sweeping way
the military's ban on homosexuals. The appeals court ruling in
Watkins' case did not address the validity of that ban, but instead
noted the Army repeatedly had re-enlisted Watkins while knowing he
is gay.
   The case nevertheless had been closely watched by gay rights
advocates.
   ``These days, we'll take a victory any way we can get one,''
said Paul DiDonato of the National Gay Rights Advocates in San
Francisco after acknowledging that Watkins' victory was a narrow
one.
   But DiDonato said Watkins' case ``sends a broader signal out to
the military and the country at large that gays and lesbians cannot
be treated unfairly forever by the military or any other
employer.''
   Watkins said, ``My next step is obviously to get reinstated.''
He said he wants to serve until he can retire with an Army pension
in about five years.
   Asked if he anticipated problems after his reinstatement,
Watkins said, ``That goes without saying. The problems that are
going to be there are the problems the system itself will
create.... I'm asking for the same rights any other citizen
receives.''
   There was no immediate reaction from the Army or the Department
of Defense.
   In other matters, the court:
   -Refused to let some Puerto Rico cable TV systems be prosecuted
for carrying The Playboy Channel, rebuffing arguments that states'
anti-obscenity efforts may be hampered unduly.
   -Left intact a ruling from Illinois that lets prosecutors punish
businesses convicted of dealing in obscenity by seizing their
property.
   -Ruled unanimously in a Mississippi case that someone suing more
than one defendant generally does not have to include all of them
in the same lawsuit.
   -Agreed to decide in a case from California whether convicted
defendants may seek a federal court's help if state courts refuse
to explain why their appeals were rejected.
   -Let stand an Ohio Supreme Court ruling that the public has no
constitutional right to attend juvenile court proceedings.
   In the case of the gay soldier, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last year said, ``Sgt. Watkins has greatly benefited the
Army, and therefore the country, by his military service.''
   ``In addition, Watkins' homosexuality clearly has not hurt the
Army in any way,'' the appeals court said. ``Equity cries out and
demands that the Army be estopped (prohibited) from refusing to
re-enlist Watkins on the basis of his homosexuality.''
   Watkins was drafted in 1968, during the Vietnam War, although he
never served there. He was 19.
   In filling out a pre-induction medical form, he marked ``yes''
in answering a question that asked whether he had homosexual
tendencies. He was inducted anyway.
   From 1967 through 1980, he was the subject of three Army
investigations. Each one was sparked by Watkins' telling a superior
about his homosexuality, but after each investigation he was
allowed to re-enlist.
   Watkins served two tours of duty in Korea and subsequently was
stationed at Fort Lewis, near Tacoma. He was allowed to re-enlist a
total of three times.
   In 1981, the Army adopted a new regulation requiring the
discharge of all homosexuals.
   A review board in 1982 voted to discharge Watkins. But before
the disharge orders were issued, a federal judge barred the Army
from taking such action.
   Seven years of court maneuvering and conflicting rulings
followed before the appeals court ruling. But Watkins, now 42, was
forced to accept an honorable discharge in 1984 after a three-judge
appeals court panel voted against him.
   His lawsuit against the Army sought reinstatement with back pay.
He would be eligible for a full Army pension with five more years
of service. Watkins has 16 years paid, but because of the legal
battle only 15 years of active duty, and thus needs five years more
to reach the 20-year mark at which service members may draw
pensions.
   The 1989 ruling by an 11-judge appeals court panel that voted
7-4 for Watkins did not say he was entitled to back pay, and
implied the Army could try to discharge him for any future
homosexual acts.
   But the ruling said the Army ``may not attempt to discharge
Watkins for any alleged homosexual acts that were the subject of
past discharge proceedings or for any past or future statements by
Watkins acknowledging his homosexuality.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush officially ended months of
partisan brawling with Congress over taxes and the budget Monday by
signing a bill to cut $492 billion from the deficit over the next
five years.
   ``No one got everything he or she wanted, but the end product is
a compromise that merits enactment,'' Bush said in a statement
affixed to the largest package of deficit cuts and tax increaeses
in history.
   Bush also signed 13 separate appropriations bills to finance the
government through the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1 and to
carry out the edicts of the budget compromise.
   While Bush convened a Rose Garden ceremony to unveil an earlier
version of the package, he signed the final measure in private,
just hours before the midnight deadline, after dinner at a local
restaurant.
   Eleven of the bills were flown from Washington by special
courier so Bush could sign them all together.
   The plan calls for over $140 billion in new taxes over the next
five years, including in increase in the tax rate on the richest
Americans from the current 28 percent to 31 percent, and even a few
points higher for some.
   Bush's abandonment of his ``no new taxes'' pledge and the long
budget stalemate between the White House and the
Democratic-controlled Congress contributed to Bush's pre-election
decline in popularity.
   It also caused severe dissension within the ranks of his own
party as many Republicans repudiated the package and Bush's
turnabout on taxes.
   ``This act is the result of long, hard work by the
administration and the Congress,'' Bush said in the statement.
   He called the measure ``an important measure for ensuring
America's long-term economic growth.''
   Bush said that the package embodied ``a new fiscal order for the
federal government.''
   The measure will lower taxes, to 31 percent, for some 3.5
million upper-middle-income taxpayers who now pay a 33 percent rate
under an anonomaly in the tax code that has placed their marginal
rates at more than the top rate for those earning substantially
more.
   The budget deal also phases out deductions for high-income
Americans and imposes higher taxes on gasoline, cigarettes,
alcohol, and on luxury items like exotic cars and yachts.
   The legislation includes a new $22 billion program of tax
credits and grant money for child care, mostly for poor working
families.
   The president said the child care measure ``will enlarge the
opportunities of parents to obtain the child care they desire.''
   Bush also signed 13 separate bills providing funds for fiscal
1991 for all federal agencies and programs. Among them:
   -A $15.3 billion foreign aid bill that would forgive Egypt's
past military debt and sharply restrict aid to El Salvador.
   -A $182 billion bill for health and human service programs that
provides money for new programs to combat AIDS while retaining a
10-year limitation on the use of federal money for abortions.
   -A $19.3 billion measure to operate the Commerce, Justice and
State departments, including more money for savings and loan
prosecutions.
   -A $268 billion defense spending bill that cuts $2 billion from
the president's $4.7 billion request for the Strategic Defense
Initiative while keeping alive the Stealth bomber sought by the
administration and the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey assault transport
Bush has tried for two years to kill.

<HEAD>Daily News Turns to Free Samples, `Hawkers' To Get Papers Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Competitors of the strike-bound Daily News have
grabbed a bigger share of the region's advertising as street sales
fall because of threats to vendors.
   To boost sales of the Nov. 4 Sunday edition, the Daily News
handed out free samples and used ``hawkers'' to sell papers where
vendors feared intimidation.
   Vendors at 10 midtown Manhattan newsstands chosen at random said
they had no Daily News; many said they hadn't seen the paper in
several days.
   Spokeswoman Lisa Robinson would not say how many of the Sunday
papers were printed, distributed or sold.
   ``We're still publishing,'' said Robinson. ``We're still seeing
gaps in distribution. Many, many people support us. Some people
don't.''
   The company also has begun a recruiting campaign to find
replacements for striking editorial staff members. A five-person
recruiting team called reporters and others at publications in the
tri-state area and landed more than 40, a News official said Nov.
2.
   Talks have been fruitless since they began in January over
contracts that expired in March. The unions charge unfair labor
practices.
   The News was struck by eight of its 10 unions on Oct. 25, with
the Newspaper Guild joining the strike the next day. Members of the
Typographical Union have continued working because they have
guaranteed lifetime jobs.
   Since the strike began, Daily News managers have been producing
the paper with help from non-union editors and reporters from other
papers owned by the paper's parent, The Tribune Co., and from union
members who crossed picket lines. Most of the union members who
have returned to work are photographers, sportswriters and feature
writers.
   Robinson said strike-related incidents led to six arrests the
night of Nov. 3 in the city and suburbs.
   Police said 24 people had been arrested in the city since the
strike began.
   In a full-page advertisement Nov. 3, the News offered a $5,000
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
people involved in strike-related violence and $500 for information
leading to an arrest.
   As the strike continues, the newspaper's rivals have said they
are enjoying a surge in advertising.
   The New York Post had 128 pages on Nov. 2, up from 100 the week
before. Alexander's department store had seven consecutive pages of
ads in the Post and two consecutive pages in the News, where it
normally advertises.
   The Post said it had picked up well over 100 pages of ads since
the strike began.
   A spokeswoman for New York Newday said that it had doubled its
ad pages and that the newspaper was budgeting for another sharp
increase the week of Nov. 5.

<HEAD>APME Convention - AP: Photos, Stocks, Commitment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardi
said The Associated Press accepts the responsibilities that go
along with its newest milestone - a record membership of 1,500
daily newspapers, reached in October.
   ``It is a responsibility that I and the able people who work
with me are pledged to meet,'' he told the Associated Press
Managing Editors Convention in Dallas.
   ``We have tried very hard to show you in these last few years
that an AP that served 90-plus percent of the nation's newspapers
could be responsive, aggressive and innovative,'' Boccardi said.
``That has been, and will be, the enduring goal of the AP.''
   Some of those innovations, such as the AP Leaf electronic
darkroom and AP's new SelectStocks service, were on display at the
convention.
   Boccardi said AP Leaf darkroom installations, which have already
begun, are expected to be completed by the end of 1991, in the
biggest such program AP has ever undertaken.
   ``Technology, however interesting or even fascinating, is just a
means,'' Boccardi said. ``It's all just a way to get words and
pictures to you, and what counts - for us and for you - is the
quality of our news and pictures. We never forget that.''
   William E. Ahearn, vice president and executive editor, told the
editors that AP's program to improve writing and editing will be
broadened in 1991.
   In addition to using outside writing coaches, as is being done
this year at the Los Angeles and Washington bureaus, he said AP
will use its best writers to work with writers in other bureaus. He
said special emphasis will be put on critiquing state news reports
and helping bureaus strengthen these reports.
   Ahearn stressed these goals for the news report:
``Aggressiveness in our overall coverage and in doing more
investigative stories and special projects; innovation and
creativity in how we package the news; innovation and creativity in
our enterprise; and innovation and creativity in the graphics to
illustrate news and features.''
   AP conducted an open forum that explored the electronic picture
system and its applications to newsrooms. The workshop consisted of
an overview by Hal Buell, assistant to the president for
PhotoStream; a report on installations by Mike Bauer, AP
communications department executive; and a report by two member
editors, Edward L. Cuddihy of The Buffalo (N.Y.) News and Scott
Harmsen of the Kalamazoo (Mich.) Gazette, both of whom have AP
Leafs.
   Throughout the convention, AP's Claudia DiMartino provided
editors with hands-on demonstrations of the AP Leaf Picture Desk.
Screened prints were created on an Autokon output device.
   David Tomlin, who is coordinating the SelectStocks program, and
SelectStocks product manager Mark Berns demonstrated the
SelectStocks 2 service in the AP booth. For the convention, the
system produced hourly tables of the performance of media company
stocks. Samples from more than 60 newspapers using the SelectStocks
services were given to members.
   Tomlin and Berns briefed the editors on the customized market
table service and described improvements and new features to be
added over the next few months.
   Tomlin said one of the most interesting changes will be the
addition in a few months of a PC-based program that will let
business editors and reporters monitor the performance of
local-interest stocks from their desks.
   The four-day convention ended Nov. 2.

<HEAD>Boccardi Sees `Slight' Encouragement for Anderson's Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent events in the Middle East offer some
encouragement that Terry Anderson, Lebanon's longest-held Western
hostage, may be released soon, Louis D. Boccardi, president and
general manager of The Associated Press, said Oct. 30.
   Anderson, the news cooperative's chief Middle Eastern
correspondent, has been held by Shiite Moslem extremists since
March 16, 1985, longer than any of the 13 Westerners, including
seven Americans, still missing in Lebanon.
   ``Of course, we can't be sure, but the spate of recent reports
of churning on the hostage front does offer slight, and I stress
slight, encouragement,'' Boccardi said at the annual convention of
the Associated Press Managing Editors association.
   Developments since August have changed political equations in
much of the Middle East.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2 reportedly led to the release
or escape of a group of Shiite prisoners in Kuwait whose freedom
had been a key demand of the Lebanese hostage-holders.
   In addition, the power balance in Lebanon itself has shifted
because of Syria's suppression of a dissident Christian military
leader there. Christian and Moslem militias have agreed to pull out
and create a military-free zone in Beirut, and sources say some
Western hostages have been moved closer to Lebanon's border with
Syria, whose government has facilitated past hostage releases.
   Boccardi said Larry Heinzerling, AP's deputy director of world
services, has been assigned full-time to work for the release of
Anderson, 43.
   `There will be no letup until Terry is free and can stand
before you and speak for himself,'' Boccardi told the association,
which comprises managing editors and other news executives of AP
member newspapers.

<HEAD>Pentagon Plans Eight Press Pools for Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military plans to form eight press pools of
six journalists each if combat begins in the Persian Gulf, the
Pentagon's chief spokesman said Nov. 1.
   ``In the event of hostilities, if they occur, we have a plan in
place which we are continually refining,'' Pete Williams said at
the convention of the Associated Press Managing Editors
association.
   Williams, assistant secretary of defense for public affairs,
launched the Pentagon's national press pool four days after
President Bush committed troops to Saudi Arabia in August.
   The pool was disbanded about three weeks later after Saudi
officials began to allow more journalists into the country.
   As many as 400 foreign journalists have been in Saudi Arabia to
cover the U.S.-led military buildup since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. About 180 journalists are in the country now, two-thirds of
them from the United States, Williams said.

<HEAD>Reuters To Cut 300 Jobs Due to `Difficult' Market Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reuters said Oct. 31 it would cut 300 jobs - 3
percent of its worldwide work force - because of unsettled market
conditions.
   Reuters said the jobs to be cut will be in the central corporate
departments covering finance, marketing and administration. A small
number of editorial jobs also could be affected.
   The company said it also would delay the launch of Dealing 2000,
an improved system for electronically providing foreign exchange
information to traders.
   ``Conditions in most financial markets remain difficult and
unsettled, making forecasting beyond the current year more than
usually hazardous,'' said managing director Glen Renfrew. ``We
cannot rule out further setbacks, but the recent new order rate has
been large enough, in combination with cost-cutting, to support
steady growth.''
   Renfrew said severence pay for those let go would cost the
company about $19.4 million in 1990.
   After absorbing this, the company expects pre-tax profits for
1990 to be about $620 million, he said.
   Reuters said it would make a statement on business conditions in
early December, when financial analysts meet in New York.

<HEAD>UPI Announces Salary Cuts for Workers Not Covered by Union
Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International said Nov. 2 it will
cut salaries of employees not covered by union contracts by 35
percent for 90 days as part of an economy move designed to bring
about a sale of the news service.
   UPI also said its board of directors had changed company policy
so that non-union employes can be dismissed without any notice or
severance pay.
   In a message to all members of the staff, UPI executive vice
president Pieter Vanbennekom said the news agency had begun talks
with the Wire Service Guild, which represents employees under union
contract.
   At the union's headquarters in New York, a member said Guild
President Kevin Keane and secretary-treasurer Chris Dahl went to
Philadelphia on Nov. 1 to meet with UPI officials. He said they had
not reported back on the meeting.
   UPI spokesman Milt Capps said employees in the Guild
jurisdiction are exempt from the salary cutback and still would be
entitled to notice and severance, whether or not they belong to the
union.
   Capps declined to say how many employees are affected or what
percentage of the staff they represent. He said it would be against
company policy to do so. The order is systemwide, he said.
   UPI has changed ownership three times in eight years and is now
owned by Infotechnology Inc. Last week, Infotechnology announced a
management shakeup and disclosed financial problems that could
result in the sale of its businesses. The company also owns
Financial News Network.
   UPI announced in September that it was closing bureaus in five
states and said Oct. 21 that it will dismiss an unspecified number
of employes as it concentrates its reporting in 15 of the most
populous states.
   The salary cuts took effect Nov. 4.
   ``All these drastic measures are necessary to bring UPI
immediately to cash flow self-sufficiency and to stabilize the
company during the next few months to be able to effect a sale of
UPI in the shortest possible order,'' Vanbennekom said.
   At least six preliminary expressions of interest in the purchase
of the wire service have been received and more are expected, he
said.
   ``Many of the expressions of interest have come from the
blue-chip companies that have the greatest possible interest in
preserving UPI's journalistic tradition of excellence,''
Vanbennekom said.
   ``To bring the process to a successful conclusion, we need the
breathing space these measures will provide,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of Memphis Publishing Co.,
publishers of The Commercial Appeal, said Oct. 31 they will
eliminate 12 jobs at the newspaper as part of several cost-cutting
moves.
   On the same day, the Nashville Banner, the Tennessee capital's
afternoon newspaper, announced the layoffs of its city editor,
chief photographer, city hall reporter and five other staff
members.
   The Commercial Appeal said its reductions would come from the
business, advertising and marketing departments. The company said
the cuts were needed to deal with increased expenses and a slight
drop in revenues.
   Joseph Williams, general manager of Memphis Publishing Co., said
earlier cost-cutting measures included reductions in travel budgets
and other expenses, and a moratorium on filling a dozen vacant
positions.
   Ten of the 12 positions cut in Memphis are covered by the
Newspaper Guild of Memphis.
   ``We don't want to see any lost jobs, but this is going on all
over the country - it's not just here,'' Guild President Faye
McCracken said.

concentrating heavily on local news.
   ``It will be all local news, 100 percent,'' said Gerald A. Bean,
president and owner of Century Group, a company that owns six
California weeklies.
   Bean announced Nov. 1 that Century would convert the Herald-News

   Jonathan F. Hays, assistant general manager of The
Press-Enterprise Co. of Riverside, confirmed the tentative
agreement.
   The Press-Enterprise, which bought the Herald-News in 1989, had
announced plans to close the paper after 67 years of publication
because of declining circulation and continued financial losses.
The newspaper, about 50 miles east of Los Angeles, was published
Monday through Friday and had a paid circulation of about 2,100.
   ``It's nice to keep a paper open if you can,'' Hays said. ``The

   The purchase price was not disclosed.
   The Redlands-based Century also publishes the La Canada Valley

<HEAD>Circulation Drops at Both Detroit Dailies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>

   Circulation dropped at both of Detroit's daily
newspapers in the six months ending Sept. 30, preliminary figures
from the Audit Bureau of Circulations show.
   Average weekday circulation for The Detroit News fell to
500,980, about 25,000 fewer newspapers a day than the last report
on March 31. It represents a loss of 190,000 daily copies from
September 1989, before the News merged its non-editorial operations
with the Detroit Free Press in a joint operating agreement.
   Weekday circulation of the Free Press fell by about 3,500 in the
last six months to 636,182, according to the circulation bureau
figures. It was about 10,000 more copies a day than in the year-ago
period.
   In the last year, the News has dropped morning home delivery as
part of the JOA agreement and eliminated most of its circulation
outside metropolitan Detroit.
   The combined Sunday News and Free Press circulation was 1.239
million at the end of September, down 31,000 from the March total

inevitably clash, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said.
   Thornburgh said at a luncheon session of the 56th annual
Associated Press Managing Editors convention on Oct. 31 that he
supports the media's right to operate without censorship. But he
added that prosecutors must put an individual's right to a fair
trial before any other concern.
   ``As much as the defendant has the right to remain silent before
the court, the prosecutor has the obligation to remain silent
outside the court,'' said Thornburgh, who has headed the Justice
Department since 1988.
   Prosecutors who leak information on pending criminal cases to
the media jeopardize not only a person's right to a fair trial but
also place the judicial system's integrity at risk, Thornburgh
said.

   Miami Beach commissioner and hotel owner Abe
Hirschfeld spat on a newspaper reporter Oct. 26, saying later he
did it in retaliation for coverage of him in The Miami Herald.
   ``In my opinion, the most powerful weapon a person can have is
spitting,'' Hirschfeld, a wealthy former New York political gadfly,
said at a news conference. ``You have to defend yourself. I did it
in self-defense. I had no other choice.''
   Hirschfeld twice spat on Miami Herald reporter Bonnie Weston as
she interviewed people attending the public auction of Hirschfeld's
hotel.
   He accused the newspaper of waging a campaign to damage him by
reporting only negative things about him and refusing to print his
letters.
   His fellow members of the city board condemned the action.
   ``Commissioner Hirschfeld's despicable conduct is revolting to
all of us,'' Commissioner Bruce Singer said.
   Ms. Weston said that the incident would not change her coverage
of Hirschfeld and that the episode ``was very much in keeping with
his character.''

<HEAD>Republicans Sue Newspaper That Refused To Run Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans filed a lawsuit Oct. 30
against Springfield Newspapers Inc. for refusing to carry an
advertising supplement in The News-Leader.
   The party's Greene County committee seeks $3,838.92 in damages,
the amount it had to pay to distribute the ``Party Talk'' tabloid
itself.
   The suit claims The News-Leader decided not to include the
insert despite a verbal agreement to do so.
   Publisher Nancy L. Green declined to discuss the lawsuit, but
noted that advertising contracts used by her newspaper and others
gave them the right to refuse ads.
   Local Republican chairman Larry Dixon said members of the
newspaper's advertising department told him some of the material
was ``objectionable to the publisher,'' but he said he was given no

<HEAD>Lawyer Sues Pittsburgh Newspaper, Reporter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney sued the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
and an investigative reporter for libel Nov. 1, claiming his
practice was hurt by articles about a state supreme court justice.
   The lawsuit, filed by James A. Ashton against the newspaper and
reporter Bill Moushey, seeks $20,000 in damages.
   It said an article published in July 1989 would have caused
readers to believe that Ashton improperly helped Justice Rolf
Larsen buy property for less than it was worth and that Larsen, in
turn, asked another judge to give favorable treatment to one of
Ashton's cients.
   The suit says Ashton acted properly and the Post-Gazette
articles were false.
   Post-Gazette Editor John Craig and Moushey declined to comment,
saying they had not received a copy of the lawsuit.

   Actress Kirstie Alley has her own way of
fighting back against the supermarket tabloids that she says make

   ``I'm about to get a list of the people at Paramount who are

Alley told The Tennessean recently.
   The star of the TV series ``Cheers'' and the new movie ``Sibling

   ``No way will I dignify those people by suing them. I try to
ignore everything, hoping people will realize what total lies they

after repeated disagreements with Murdoch over the political
independence of the newspaper.
   Random House obtained the rights to publish Murdoch's memoirs

   Journalists from 20 African countries
agreed Oct. 29 to send protest notes to four African leaders and
Iraq's Saddam Hussein to complain about repression of the press.
   They singled out Iraq, South Africa, Sudan, Uganda and Zaire for
harsh criticism after hearing accounts of alleged murders, torture,
detentions and routine harassment against journalists.
   Saddam was included because some African reporters were detained
with other foreigners by Iraqi forces after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion

explore ways of strengthening unions in Africa, ending state
controls over the media and helping to speed up democratization in
white-ruled South Africa.

   Uruguay's oldest newspaper, El Dia,
published an edition of only eight pages Oct. 29 and told readers
it is on the verge of collapse.
   The 104-year-old paper began to slide economically a decade ago
when the military government then in power ruled it must pay the
same taxes as other businesses.
   Recently, El Dia has suffered labor problems. In September, it
was shut down four days by a strike.
   Many Uruguayan papers are suffering as a result of the nation's

   The Big Three television networks plan Election
Night coverage in varying degrees of depth and intensity, but the
Cable News Network is devoting most of the night to the off-year
elections.
   ABC and NBC plan their principal coverage in hour-long news
specials at 10 p.m. EST, followed by local news at 11 p.m.; CBS has
scheduled a two-hour show, from 9 to 11 p.m.; and all three plan
11:30 p.m. wrapup reports.
   CNN's main coverage runs from 7 p.m. EST to 1 a.m., when its
90-minute wrapup show begins. Its final wrapup is at 3 a.m. ``This
is the most extensive coverage we've had in an off year,'' said
spokeswoman Melinda McIntire.
   As they did in the last off-year elections in 1986, NBC and ABC
are leading into full-time coverage with prime time shows; CBS, the
only network that filled all of prime time with its coverage in
'86, has cut back an hour.
   This is the first year that all four networks have pooled
resources for exit polling and winner projections, in a $12 million
joint venture called Voter Research and Surveys, or VRS.
   VRS will give each network polls and projections for all Senate,

<HEAD>Kinard Resigns as KSL-TV News Director</HEAD>

   J. Spencer Kinard, news director at KSL-TV
and the voice of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's weekly broadcasts,
resigned from the station after his friendship with an anchorwoman
created friction in the newsroom, a spokesman said Nov. 1.
   A choir spokesman said no decision had been reached by Mormon
Church leaders on whether Kinard would continue as announcer for
the choir's ``Music and the Spoken Word'' program, a post he has
held for 18 years.
   Kinard offered his resignation as vice president for news and
public affairs in a letter Oct. 31 to Bill Murdoch, KSL vice
president.
   ``I am convinced that the events over the past few weeks have
made it impossible for me to be effective in that position,''
Kinard wrote.
   Kinard's resignation after 18 years as news director came two
weeks after a staff meeting in which Kinard, 50, sought to quell
controversy surrounding his friendship with noon anchorwoman
Jennifer Howe, 24.
   Some staffers later threatened to resign if he remained. The
next day Kinard was given ``medical leave'' from KSL and from his
role as the voice of the choir's weekly CBS Radio Network

presented its 1990 Public Service Awards to the San Jose (Calif.)
Mercury News and the Washington (N.C.) Daily News.
   The San Jose Mercury News was selected in the 50,000-and-over
circulation category for its coverage, including public service
information, following the Oct. 17 earthquake that devastated parts
of Northern California.
   The Washington Daily News led those in the under-50,000
circulation class for uncovering the fact that city officials for
eight years had known cancer-causing chemicals were in the local
tap water. The disclosure resulted in a two-month water ban, an
improved treatment system, and state and federal reviews of water
regulations.
   Paul Janensch, editor and general manager of The Journal-News in
Rockland County, N.Y., and chairman of the judging panel, presented
the plaques on Nov. 2, the final day of the APME convention.
   The other judges, all former presidents of APME, were Larry
Allison, senior vice president and editor of the Long Beach
(Calif.) Press-Telegram; James F. Daubel, editor and publisher of
The News-Messenger of Fremont, Ohio; Robert H. Giles, editor and
publisher of The Detroit News; Robert J. Haiman, president of the
Poynter Institute for Media Studies, St. Petersburg, Fla.; Ted M.
Natt, editor and publisher of The Daily News of Longview, Wash.;
and Robert E. Rhodes, Atwood Professor of Journalism at the
University of Alaska at Anchorage.
   The other finalists in the 50,000-and-over circulation category
were Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal; Chicago Tribune; The Des Moines
(Iowa) Register; The Detroit News; Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader;
The Courier-Journal of Louisille, Ky.; The Philadelphia Inquirer;
Seattle Post-Intelligencer; and The Blade of Toledo, Ohio.
   The under 50,000-circulation finalists were The Albuquerque

Casper, Wyo.; Columbia (Mo.) Missourian; Livingston (Mont.)
Enterprise; The Sun News of Myrtle Beach, S.C.; West County Times
of Richmond, Calif.; The Salina (Kan.) Journal; and Valley News
Dispatch of Tarentum, Pa.
   The Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was the winner of the
top award in the Freedom of Information competition.

impose adequate controls on care centers, leading to client deaths
and injuries among such diverse groups as infants, retarded adults
and teen-age criminals.
   Three citations also were awarded for extraordinary effort

   -The Detroit News for an investigation tracing payments from a
secret Detroit police fund, through which more than $1 million in
taxpayer money was laundered.
   -The Daily Reflector of Greenville, N.C., for revelations
concerning the background of a candidate for Superior Court judge,
resulting in legislation opening the records of the North Carolina
Judicial Standards Commission.
   -The Hartford (Conn.) Courant for an examination of the

   Filmmaker Ken Burns, creator of PBS's acclaimed documentary
``The Civil War,'' blasted American television for offering
``nearly the same thing everywhere ... on dozens of clonelike
channels.'' Burns also told the National Press Club on Oct. 29 that
``a kind of cultural peerage'' has been conferred on a small group
of TV commentators. ``Issues and ideas are merely pushed around the
plate, never digested, by the same people,'' he said. ...
   Press scrutiny of political candidates is beneficial, so long as
the media practices ``fairness to the max,'' former San Antonio
Mayor Henry Cisneros said. ``I suspect what we're in for is a
future where this kind of scrutiny becomes the order of the day,''
Cisneros told editors at the Associated Press Managing Editors
association convention in Dallas. ``There will be no heroes,
because there are no perfect people. We're going to scare some
people off.'' ...
   Dan Martin, deposed news editor of Baptist Press, said the
struggle between conservative and moderate elements in the Southern
Baptist Convention didn't end with his dismissal from the
denomination's news agency. ``We're flying down the side of a
cliff, hoping there's water down there somewhere,'' Martin said in
a Charlotte, N.C., talk. ``Churches across the nation are being
ripped asunder by the conflict.''

   President Bush, campaigning hard for GOP
candidates in the final hours before Tuesday's elections, says
people should ignore ``all these gloomy assessments'' about the
national mood and just go vote.
   The president is concentrating on energizing campaign workers
and spurring voters to the polls as the election looms with
uncertainty for the Republican Party.
   Bush was spending his last full day on the campaign trail today
in his adoptive home state of Texas, trying to help gubernatorial
contender Clayton Williams in his close race against Democrat Ann
Richards.
   Winding up an eight-state pre-election tour, Bush was
campaigning with Williams in Waco and Tyler before returning to
Houston for a state Republican Party reception.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - An American-led offensive to drive Iraq out of
Kuwait probably would begin with nighttime air strikes inside Iraq
to sever Saddam Hussein's links to his huge occupying army,
military planners and private analysts say.
   Such a campaign, launched with the allied forces now arrayed
against Iraq, would seek to exploit Iraq's weaknesses in air power
and its apparent vulnerability in Kuwait to a seaborne assault and
to naval bombardment from the Persian Gulf.
   President Bush has said repeatedly in recent days that he is
growing impatient with Saddam's continuing occupation of Kuwait,
though he has not decided to resort to military force. He has
stressed, however, that force remains an active option and that he
will not permit the Iraqi army to stay indefinitely in Kuwait.
   U.S. military officials won't discuss specific war plans, and
they stress that Bush, for now at least, has not changed their
mission: It remains the defense of Saudi Arabia and enforcement of
United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A new law limiting advertising on kids' TV
shows will force the Federal Communications Commission to finally
decide if toy-based programs such as ``G.I. Joe'' are really
half-hour commercials.
   If they are, the shows will be taken off the air. But such a
finding also could threaten educational shows like ``Sesame
Street'' and Disney offerings because these programs, too, might be
seen as promotions for their widely merchandised toys and other
products.
   The commission never has found product-based shows to be
commercials, and few observers expect it now to seriously clamp
down on such programs.
   ``Color me skeptical. I think the FCC is disposed to do as
little as it thinks it can get away with,'' Andrew J. Schwartzman,
executive director of the Washington-based Media Access Project
advocacy group, said in an interview last week.
   ---&equals;
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Mary Martin was remembered upon her death for
a tomboyish charm and vibrancy that lit up the stage whether she
flew high in ``Peter Pan'' or sang to children in ``The Sound of
Music.''
   Martin, one of the New York theater's leading ladies for more
than 30 years, died of cancer Saturday at age 76 at her home in
Rancho Mirage.
   The actress captivated audiences with her spunk and her joyous
singing in such Broadway musicals as ``South Pacific,'' ``The Sound
of Music,'' ``I Do! I Do!'' and ``Leave It to Me.''
   ``Vibrant, exciting and always full of life, Mary gave her
millions of fans the world over some of the most memorable and
thrilling moments in the history of entertainment,'' said former
first lady Nancy Reagan, who appeared with her in the 1946 musical
``Lute Song.''

<HEAD>Wondering How to Gauge the Impact of Today's Votes? Here's Some
Help</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In mid-term elections that will deliver two
more years of divided government, President Bush can't win as much
as he has at risk.
   And his Republican Party needs against-the-odds gains in the
Senate, plus added strength in the statehouses to have a chance of
cracking Democratic control of Congress later in the decade.
   The danger for Democrats is that voters really are frustrated,
angry enough to punish incumbents in Congress, the way GOP
campaigners have been urging. Since Republicans are outnumbered in
the House, they'd stand to gain, even if some of their own veterans
are ousted.
   But there's been no advance sign of a tide that would swamp many
congressional incumbents, most of them heavily bankrolled and
heavily favored.
   Short of a change in congressional control, which is not in view
this time, there is no simple test of national impact in off-year
elections.
   But today's balloting could affect Bush's negotiating strength
in dealing with the Democratic Congress for the rest of his term
and Republican chances of gaining House control for the rest of the
century.
   Among the checkpoints:
   -Bush's power to veto legislation and make it stick, key to his
bargaining power with Congress. Should the Democrats gain 10 to 12
House seats or a handful in the Senate, that power would be at
risk.
   -Republican strength in congressional redistricting by the state
legislatures and governors next year. These elections will
determine which party controls that process in the big states that
are gaining and losing House seats because of population shifts
reported in the 1990 Census.
   And the political alignment of the new districts will be a major
factor in shaping the House for the next decade. All told, 20
states gain or lose House seats. The three key contests are
election of governors in California, Florida and Texas, which are
gaining 14 of the 19 House seats to be shifted in reapportionment.
   -Positioning for the 1992 elections, which are more likely to
produce a congressional shakeup. Redistricting is one reason.
Another is the law that entitles veteran House members who retire
after this election to convert leftover campaign funds to personal
use. Republicans look to those changes to help them whittle the
Democratic majority. In the Senate, the GOP hopes to move within
range of control next time, when 20 Democratic seats will be at
stake and only 11 of its own. Those longer-term Republican aims
could be put out of reach by Democratic gains this time.
   While the president is not on any ballot, his performance is
among the issues - and Bush's autumn slump has been a drag on the
GOP.
   Still, off-year campaigns are not a referendum on a president,
even when he says otherwise, as Ronald Reagan did in 1986 when he
asked people to vote for him one last time. It didn't work -
Republicans lost control of the Senate that year. They had won
control with a 12-seat gain when Reagan was elected in 1980.
   This time, neither party anticipates so clear a verdict.
Republicans concede that the Senate is beyond their reach - John
Sununu, the White House chief of staff, forecasts a standoff or
close to it, in competition for 34 seats today. The lineup now is
55 Democrats, 45 Republicans.
   The House is more heavily Democratic than it has been at the
mid-term of any Republican president in this century. The Democrats
have 259 seats and their strategists expect gains of 10 or so in
today's balloting.
   The off-year average is 25 seats lost by the White House party.
Sununu cites that benchmark and says the GOP goal is to hold losses
to fewer than half the average.
   But losses in that range would jeopardize the Bush veto margin,
and with it his strategy for dealing with the Democratic Congress.
Bush has used 16 vetoes, and the threat of others, to bargain for
his position on issues from abortion to the minimum wage to crime
legislation to the budget.
   He's never been overridden, which takes two-thirds votes in both
branches of Congress, but it's sometimes been close. The last House
override attempt, on a textile quota bill, fell 10 votes short. The
Senate came within a vote of overriding his civil rights bill veto.
   And the enforceable veto is likely to become increasingly
important in the next Congress, as Bush and the Democrats head
toward the 1992 campaign for the White House.

   When Americans prepare to vote today they might
dwell again on those spending ``cuts'' passed by Congress that will
somehow cut household budgets but raise Uncle Sam's expenditures.
   A lot of Americans say it doesn't make sense, and it probably
doesn't. At the least it's confusing: Did Congress cut spending as
it says it did? Or did it merely cut the spending ability of
American households?
   The easy explanation is the one usually offered, that because of
the seriousness of the budget deficit an enlightened Congress
reached the tortuously difficult decision simultaneously to raise
your taxes and cut its spending.
   But there is more to the explanation than that, and some critics
contend it involves financial sleight of hand, accounting gimmicks
and deliberate misrepresentation by those very people elected to
represent Americans.
   Taxes will rise, for sure. A labor-supported research group,
Citizens for Tax Justice, says the added tax tab for a family of
four might be around $321, a sizable sum for families who felt they
had cut their budget to the bone.
   But spending will not be cut. It will rise.
   A conservative scholar, Scott Hodge, contends that to claim
spending cuts is to lie. ``Congress did not have the courage to cut
one dollar of waste, pork, fraud, or unnecessary spending from the
fiscal 1991 budget,'' he says.
   Hodge, budget expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation,
says Congress will spend $1.75 for every new dollar of taxes raised
in the new tax package. ``They are lying when they say that
spending will be cut,'' he says.
   Indeed, he continues, they gave their favorite programs big
increases over fiscal 1990 funding levels, and he points out that
these programs will continue to grow over the five-year life of the
package.
   By his calculations, non-defense domestic spending is guaranteed
to rise by $245 billion through 1995, or 6 percent a year. And to
this must be added net interest on the debt, and whatever it takes
to bail out the savings and loans.
   But, you say, Congress said it had cut spending. Yes, it did,
but Congress speaks a language neither linguists nor private-sector
accountants understand. Briefly, it first raises the numbers, then
cuts from them.
   While some of the absurd projects - the fabled $84,000 study of
why people fall in love or the $2,500 study of the causes of
rudeness, lying and cheating on tennis courts - might not be as
obvious, favorite local projects are.
   Bee research money for Utah, for example, and peanut research
for Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, locoweed research for New
Mexico, a ``navigation project'' for Redondo Beach, Calif., a zebra
mussel research project...
   Such projects often are worthwhile, but Hodge suggests they
might involve local, special interests rather than those of the
federal government and the public interest, and for that reason
should be scrutinized.
   Hodge has a long list of guideliness for use by Congress if it
really wants to cut, rather than twist the language and the numbers
to say it is cutting. These, he says, are among those projects that
should raise questions:
   -Programs that serve localized or special interests.
   -Programs that have failed, fulfilled their missions, outlived
their usefuless or simply become irrelevant.
   -Those programs that duplicate or contradict other programs.
   -Proposals that suggest Congress is engaging in central planning
or seeking to set national priorities that should be left to
individuals or communities.
   -Programs that compete with private commercial enterprises.
   Hodge suggests still another area where spending reform could
have been practiced. At the time of his study, he says, the
appropriations bill for the legislative branch was unavailable.
   ``Had it been printed,'' he says, ``it would show the 30 percent
pay raise that Congress gave itself earlier this year.''

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A story Venezuelans tell on their
Colombian neighbors is coming true at home.
   A traveler tells a friend: ``I saw the Eiffel Tower, so I knew
we were in Paris. I saw the Pope and figured we were in Rome. One
day I reached for my wallet and it was gone. I knew I was in
Colombia.''
   These days, with the oil boom of the early 1980s long gone,
Venezuela is earning its own reputation for missing wallets, armed
robbery, stolen cars, business fraud and government corruption.
   Caracas was a small colonial city of unlocked doors 40 years
ago. Now it is a metropolis of apartment buildings surrounded by
walls of stone and steel, patrolled by armed guards and dogs.
   Nightlife has dwindled. Hardly anyone stops to help a stranger.
Squatter shacks sprout near mansions.
   There are no safe zones. One of the city's most hazardous areas
is Las Mercedes, known for fancy restaurants, expensive boutiques
and armed robbers.
   The mayor of Caracas outlawed liquor sales after midnight,
figuring less drinking would mean less crime, but the trend
continued upward.
   Last month, President Carlos Andres Perez sent a 600-member
National Guard unit into the streets.
   Crime ``has forced us to require the National Guard in new
roles, with greater importance, more members'' and a mandate to
work ``permanently in cities such as Caracas,'' he said.
   Venezuela had a decade-long oil boom, during which its people
felt immune to such problems. The rich times were followed by seven
years of economic decline that exposed the immunity as a myth.
   Half the nation is desperately poor, and nearly half the workers
earn less than $100 a month, but most of those who try to explain
the crime wave blame other things.
   Many mention a national desire to continue living high with
little effort, known as ``facilismo.''
   Andres Coba of the national neighborhood association FACUR said
in an interview at a fashionable outdoor cafe: ``We had so much
money the whole world aspired to it. We sat at tables like these in
our New York clothes, and talked about France and Madrid.''
   Police chief Gonzalo Elias Bajares Colmenares, who has 7,000 men
in a city of about 4.5 million, took a similar view.
   ``People aren't stealing eggs or ham or bread or meat,'' he
said, but generally ``trying to get money to pay for luxury
items.''
   Authorities blame youths under 18 for 75 percent of street
crime, but many run free because of lenient punishment for
juveniles and become pawns of adult gangs. Overcrowded jails and
political judges clog the criminal justice system.
   Here are some recent cases:
   -A youth gang attacked a 15-year-old handicapped boy and stole
his wheelchair.
   -Just before breakfast, a lone armed robber raided the residence
of the Argentine ambassador, on embassy row half a block from a
police station. He got away with $10,000 worth of loot, including
the cook's paycheck, leaving the ambassador and his wife bound and
gagged.
   -Thieves broke into the home of Jules Waldman, a 77-year-old
American who founded the city's English-language newspaper.
Waldman, in delicate health, was hospitalized and died of a stroke
a month later.
   -On two occasions, gangs followed Germans on package tours to
the same resort, held up the hotel staff and made off with
passports, cameras and the contents of the hotel safe.
   -Thieves who tried to steal his car shot the son of a former
government minister to death in a wealthy neighborhood last New
Year's Eve.
   Sometimes, police are the criminals. Thirteen Caracas officers
were suspended in July, accused of burglarizing downtown shops.
Chief Bajares fired 107 policemen in a year's time, some of whom
were charged with robbery, theft or murder.
   Low pay - $185 a month for a Caracas street cop - is cited as
one factor turning policemen to crime, but the problem goes deeper.
Many come from the same violent, deprived backgrounds as criminals,
64 percent did not finish high school and 40 percent live in slums.
   The national attorney general's office is said to have
investigated more than 1,500 cases against police this year. The
new governor of western Carabobo state said the state police force
was riddled with criminals and fred 350 officers.
   White collar crime is estimated to have cost billions of dollars
in the 1980s, but no one has been sent to jail under an
anti-corruption law passed in 1983.
   Crime threatens to suffocate the infant tourist industry.
According to a Tourism Ministry survey, more than 70 percent of
tourists said they would not return.
   ``As long as Venezuela is such a den of thieves and corrupt
peacekeepers, the country will not be able to attract tourists in
significant numbers or persuade those who do come to return,'' a
British tourist wrote to to a Caracas newspaper.
   He said a mugger tried to steal his camera at high noon in
downtown Caracas.
   An Austrian tour agent wrote, ``In no other South American
country have I felt so cheated'' by overcharging, bad service and
fake promotional claims.

<HEAD>Rampant Racism and the Glory of Football</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note language in 9th graf, ``Bissinger said,'' and 17th graf,
``I think.''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES RICHARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter H.G. Bissinger
went to a small Texas town to discover how high school sports can
bind a community.
   What he found was a town where racism was rampant, football
received more support than English and school district lines were
drawn to make sure that the best athletes went to the best school.
   ``Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream'' has become
a best seller, but not in Odessa, where threats were made to two
bookstores carrying the volume, the author said.
   Bissinger gives a graphic look inside the Permian High School
huddle and field house, and into the Friday night spectacle of
packed stadiums and screaming fans.
   ``I went in search of the Friday night lights, to find a town
where they brightly blazed that lay beyond the East Coast and the
grip of the big cities, a place that people had to pull out an
atlas to find and had seen better times, a real America,'' writes
Bissinger, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 with two other
Philadelphia Inquirer reporters for a six-part investigative series
exposing corruption in the Philadelphia court system. He now works
for the Chicago Tribune.
   Bissinger said he found those lights in Odessa, and they burned
with more intensity than he had ever imagined.
   ``Like thousands of others, I got caught up in them,'' he said.
``So did my wife. So did my children. As someone later described
it, those lights become an addiction if you live in a place like
Odessa, the Friday night fix.''
   He was troubled by how many people in Odessa traced the city's
troubles to a judge's desegregation order in 1982. The order forced
the closing of Odessa's predominantly black Ector High School and
divided its students between Permian and Odessa high schools, with
district lines suspiciously drawn so the top black athletes would
go to Permian.
   Bissinger said he found common use of the word ``nigger'' among
boosters, public officials, merchants and ordinary residents - as
well as coaches and white players on Permian's predominantly white
football team, the Panthers.
   Permian's coaches were openly derisive of blacks when none was
around and forced players to compete when injured, the author said.
Shots were given at halftime of games to relieve pain or to replace
body fluids.
   ``I was extremely disappointed. There were so many things he
could have written that were positive, that weren't focused on,''
said then-coach Gary Gaines, who gave Bissinger unrestricted access
to Permian during 1988 when the twice-beaten Panthers lost again in
the state semifinals.
   ``We just gave him free run of the mill,'' said Gaines, now
defensive secondary coach at Texas Tech. ``He came and went and
attended every practice, every game, every meeting. He was writing
all the time. We didn't have anything to hide. We really liked the
guy.''
   What stings the most, Gaines said, is the book's portrayal of
him and his coaches as racists.
   ``That hurts, because that certainly is not what we based our
program on,'' he said. ``We don't talk like that, and didn't.''
   Gaines said he took Bissinger at his word that he planned to
write a positive book about the fabled Odessa Permian football
program.
   Bissinger, however, said he doesn't recall telling Gaines he was
doing a positive piece.
   ``I think I told him there were elements that would be positive,
and I felt that the book would have been positive,'' the author
said. ``But a lot of things happened that made it impossible to be
a positive book. ... I'm not the one who called an 18-year-old
black kid a `big old dumb nigger.' One of his coaches did that. I
certainly wasn't the one who sent the wrong film to Harvard on
behalf of a black kid (a game in which the student didn't play).
That was Coach Gaines.
   ``I knew these people and became friendly with them, and it was
difficult to write the things I did, but I had to be honest and
objective and say things I felt had to be said.''
   Bissinger was spurred into writing the book in part because of
his own past as ``an addicted sports fan'' who had spent much of
his time watching football, basketball and baseball.
   ``The idea had been rattling in my head since I was 13 years
old, the idea of high school sports keeping a town together,
keeping it alive,'' he said.
   Bissinger played two years of high school football, and was
sports editor of both his high school and college newspaper - the
Daily Pennsylvanian at University of Pennsylvania.
   ``Friday Night Lights'' describes a city hit hard when oil
prices plummeted in the early 1980s, ruining a region that depends
upon petroleum.
   Odessa's obsession with one of the nation's most successful high
school football programs enabled residents to keep their heads high
and remain upbeat no matter how bleak the economy. The Panthers
have been in nine state finals since 1965, winning five
championships, three in the '80s.
   But to its detriment, Odessa relegated everything else behind
football, Bissinger writes.
   Little was expected academically of Permian football players,
the book says. One lineman's senior year classes consisted of
government and the electives of sociology, computer math,
photography and food science.
   ``He breezed through them with ease. Then came the hard work. He
got to football practice, where the demands and pressures were
ceaseless the second he stepped on the field,'' Bissinger wrote.
   ``Nothing he did went unnoticed. If he did something well, he
received praise. If he did something wrong, it was pointed out in
painstaking detail. And if it wasn't detected during practice, it
was discovered afterward, when the coaches retired to their office
to watch videos of the day's workout on the elaborate video machine
that had been donated by the booster club.''
   During the 1988 season, Permian spent $70,000 for chartered jets
for the players to and from distant game sites.
   The school spent more for medical supplies for athletic programs
at Permian - $6,750 - than it did for teaching materials for the
English department - $5,040 - which did not cover required
textbooks.
   The salary of the head of the English department at Permian was
$32,000, compared to Gaines' salary of $48,000, plus free use of a
new sedan each year.

   Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin recently talked
about how to turn nighttime dreams into fun and profit.
   ```Jacob's Ladder' came to me as a dream,'' he said. ``It
started with me in the subway - the underworld of New York in a
sense. As I left the train and walked along a very deserted
platform late at night, I walked up the stairs and found the gate
was locked. That has happened to me in real life, but in the dream
I just felt that something was wrong.
   ``I walked to the other end of the platform, and that exit was
locked as well. I got very frightened and I said, `Something
terrible is happening.' I had this feeling that the only way out
was down, through the bowels of New York. I felt I would have to go
to hell to become free, to get out.''
   That's the start of Tim Robbins' descent into a personal hell in
``Jacob's Ladder.'' It's a thriller written by Rubin, a hot
screenwriter because of ``Ghost,'' and directed by Adrian Lyne,
also hot because of ``Fatal Attraction.''
   Robbins is a Vietnam veteran beset with dreams and
hallucinations. He learns that his combat buddies have undergone
the same bedevilment, and he tries to discover the reason.
   Two years have passed since Lyne's sensation-ridden ``Fatal
Attraction.'' Why the gap? The director explained that ``Jacob's
Ladder'' started at Paramount Pictures, but fell from favor after a
change in regimes. The project shifted to Columbia Pictures.
   ``Also, I worked for a year on the special effects aspects of
the movie,'' he added. ``One problem that took a long while was
that we did all the special effects in-camera, when we shot, rather
than handing over the special effects as a kind of package to a
company like ILM (Industrial Light and Magic).
   ``I was anxious to do it that way because I think that sometimes
movies with special effects get into a kind of sameness, because
the same guy is doing the special effects for all of them.''
   Robbins, known for his off-center comedy in such movies as
``Bull Durham'' and ``Cadillac Man,'' was a surprise casting as the
bedeviled veteran.
   ``He obviously wasn't an obvious choice in commercial terms,''
Lyne admitted. ``The studio would have been happy with a Mel Gibson
or a Harrison Ford, who bring an audience to a movie. I liked Tim.
I think he's a very vulnerable, sympathetic man, for a start, and I
loved him in `Bull Durham.'
   ``Because this is a kind of dark story, I thought it was
important to have an actor who had a sense of humor. Tim is an
actor who finds humor where it doesn't necessarily exist in a
scene.''
   Lyne, who also directed ``Flashdance'' and ``9{ Weeks,'' now has
made two thrillers in a row. How far can he go with terror?
   ``I think if it's kind of gratuitous, if you're just doing it
for effect, the audience senses it, and it doesn't work,'' he said.
``I learned an awful lot from making `Fatal Attraction.' I studied
a lot of suspense movies, and hopefully I learned from them. I
think there are moments in `Jacob's Ladder' that are genuinely
frightening.
   ``When I see a movie, I like to be put through it. I like having
highs up there and lows down there and feeling drained at the end
of the movie as though I'd been through something. That's better
than a movie that just washes over you and is forgotten in two
minutes.''
   Bruce Joel Rubin will turn director-writer on his next project
for Paramount.
   ``One of the wonderful benefits of being a successful writer in
Hollywood is that they allow you to do what I consider to be
writing the final draft of a movie: that is, to direct it,'' he
said. ``Screenplays in Hollywood are never really seen by anybody
but the director and some studio people. What is on the screen is
the ultimate screenplay. It's not what the writer wrote.
   ``It's very frustrating for a writer to have his work translated
by other people. I'm the luckiest guy alive to have had wonderful
translations. What I've wanted more than anything is to direct my
own scripts. Now, thanks to the success of `Ghost,' Paramount has
given me that opportunity.''

<HEAD>Big Quake Yields Big Exaggerations in NBC Mini-Series</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buy extra water, hoard some groceries and
dive under your desk. NBC is about to ravage the nation's second
largest city in an upcoming mini-series, ``The Big One: The Great
Los Angeles Earthquake.''
   Just remember, it's sweeps time.
   In the quest for big ratings, television's magnitude-8 seismic
disaster is far more catastrophic than the real ``big one'' the
government says is at least 60 percent likely to rock Southern
California within 30 years.
   Modern skyscrapers are flattened. Quakes last too long for the
magnitudes they are assigned by the movie's writers. Death and
destruction are rampant, even though scientists and officials
expect most of the city and its residents will survive the real
great earthquake.
   The two-part series airs 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. EST, next Sunday and
Monday.
   ``I don't think we will ever see the devastation they depicted
in the movie,'' said Paul Flores, director of the Southern
California Earthquake Preparedness Project, part of the state
Office of Emergency Services.
   ``The concern is that it's difficult to sell preparedness when
people are shown that level of devastation. It leads to fatalism.
The public will ask, `How do you prepare for something like
that?'''
   Lucy Jones, a seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in
Pasadena, served as a technical adviser for the mini-series and
also as a model for its heroine: crusading, quake-predicting USGS
seismologist Claire Winslow, played by Joanna Kerns of ``Growing
Pains.''
   ``The damage from the earthquake is awfully extreme. They've
gone for the worst possible earthquake,'' the 35-year-old Jones
said. ``It gives the image that in an earthquake, you're likely to
die.
   ``The truth is that even in the worst-case scenarios, with
10,000 or 20,000 people dead, that's one-tenth of 1 percent of the
people in the affected area. Even in a bad disaster chances are
you're not going to die.''
   Jones convinced the mini-series' makers to tone down some
exaggerations, but said many of her objections were met by the
response, ``That's too bad, we need that for the dramatic effect.''
   Unfortunately, the movie often lacks enough drama. It takes all
of part one to reach the brink of disaster. And the plot is mucked
up by a political assassination attempt, a soap opera involving
Winslow's mother and sister, and what Jones calls ``gratuitous
sex'' between Winslow and her husband, portrayed by Dan Lauria of
ABC's ``The Wonder Years.''
   ``The Big One'' does have some redeeming social value.
   It emphasizes the need for citizens to prepare themselves by
learning how to shut off natural gas lines to their homes and
assemble quake supplies such as water, food, batteries and
flashlights.
   Damage to lifelines such as electricity, water lines, phones and
transportation links is depicted fairly accurately.
   The movie also illustrates possible shortcomings of locating Los
Angeles' emergency operations center four levels underground and
correctly shows how most citizens must fend for themselves after a
big quake.
   But seismologist Claire Winslow displays absolutely unrealistic
certainty in predicting the big quake is imminent. And an Office of
Emergency Services official, played by Joe Spano of ``Hill Street
Blues,'' is unrealistically portrayed as a political hack trying to
muzzle Winslow to protect a wealthy developer.
   Such drawbacks seriously hurt and oversimplify the depiction of
the dilemma facing officials who must decide whether to warn the
public about very uncertain signs that seismic disaster might be
imminent.
   While the expected ``big one'' most likely will be an magnitude
7.5 to 8 quake some distance from Los Angeles on the San Andreas
Fault, the movie version is a magnitude 8 quake on the Elysian Park
Fault, directly under the heart of the city. Seismologists suspect
that fault probably would produce a quake no worse than magnitude
6.5 to 7.
   The quake in the mini-series ``is a very unlikely quake,'' Jones
said. ``It could happen, but it's improbable. ... It's an
absolutely worst-case scenario.''
   Flores objects to the public hysteria, looting and panic shown
after the quake prediction is publicized.
   ``People behave a lot more rationally,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Jones enjoyed working on ``The Big One,'' and said
viewers ``should remember it's a movie. It's not reality.''
   As for Kerns' portrayal of a Jones-like character, the real
seismologist said: ``I've never been as skinny as she is and never
will be in my life.''

   THEY'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER - ``Frontline,'' the distinguished PBS
investigative documentary series, takes a long hard look tonight at
lotteries - the staes that run them, the promoters who design and
sell them, and the people who buy the tickets.
   ``Betting on the Lottery'' focuses on Sharon Sharp, the director
of Illinois' state lottery, who took over the 16-year-old lottery
three years ago with a mandate to revitalize it.
   ``Frontline'' also visits Maryland, a state with the
second-highest per capita betting on the lottery, and questions the
morality of the lottery.
   ``The state is not taking care of people. The state is taking
advantage of people's weakness for gambling,'' says a state
legislator from Baltimore.

<HEAD>Sir Richard Francis Burton: A 19th-Century James Bond</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORIAN BENKOIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He was an explorer, a thrillseeker, a womanizer,
insatiably curious, painfully opinionated and, maybe, a spy.
   Disguised, he was the first Westerner to visit Mecca, and he led
the first white man's expedition to Africa's Lake Tanganyika.
   ``Sir Richard Francis Burton was the James Bond of the 19th
century,'' says author Edward Rice.
   But unlike Agent 007, Burton really existed.
   Rice's new biography, ``Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton, The
Secret Agent Who Made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered the Kama
Sutra and brought the Arabian Nights to the West,'' is a surprise
best seller, making its way to non-fiction Top 10 lists.
   A British edition of the Rice biography is being prepared, and
Rice says he recently started negotiations for translations into
German, Spanish and Japanese.
   The book charts ``Ruffian Dick'' from his peripatetic childhood
in France, England and Italy, through his Arabian and African
adventures, until his restless final years in Trieste, Italy.
There, he translated the Arabian Nights and erotic works, such as
the Kama Sutra, which were hardly sitting-room fair in prim
Victorian England.
   Burton spoke at least 29 languages - often passing for a native
speaker when his life depended on it - mastered swordsmanship,
survived a spear through his jaw, wrote 43 books and over 100
articles and translated at least a dozen works from at least five
tongues.
   Stubbornly unwilling to bend to Victorian prohibitions or
political expediency, Burton detailed female circumcision and
homosexual brothels with the same zest as he did the ethnography of
Nile River peoples.
   A man of extremes, he gorged opium and other exotic drugs, and
spent much of a half-year trip to the United States drunk.
   And, writes Rice, Burton played a large, but much more secret,
role in the ``Great Game,'' the British machinations which led to
eventual conquests of much of the Middle East, India and Northern
Africa.
   Yet, dogged by sometimes jealous and vituperative political
enemies, Burton, dubbed ``The White Nigger,'' went largely
unrewarded and never surpassed the unremarkable rank of captain in
the British armed services. In his 40s, he was posted as consul to
backwater Sao Paolo, Brazil, and to Fernando Po, ``an isolated,
foresaken island in the Bight of Biafra on the African west
coast,'' writes Rices.
   Largely through the efforts of his devoted and well-connected
wife, Isabel, Burton finally escaped for a stint as consul of
beloved Damascus.
   But again unable to appease his powerful foes as skillfully as
he charmed his myriad friends, Burton was soon posted to the
near-exile of Trieste.
   A life as fascinating as Burton's, of course, has not escaped
previous notice. Those around him, including Isabel, wrote
sometimes emotionally charged articles and biographies after his
death at age 72, 100 years ago.
   But not until 1963 did Byron Farwell, in ``Burton, A Biography
of Sir Richard Francis Burton,'' take a comprehensive and more
objective look. (Farwell's work was reissued in 1988 and, for the
first time, published in the United States by Penguin.) At least
four other biographies followed before Rice's. Burton's character
also dominated the 1972 BBC miniseries ``The Search for the Nile.''
   Rudyard Kipling based at least two fictional characters on
Burton, says Rice. Philip Jose Farmer chose him as the hero of his
``Riverworld'' science fiction series, in which everyone who has
died past the age of five comes back to life. Burton, as if not
intriguing enough in fact, was fictionalized in William Harrison's
``Burton and Speke,'' the basis for this year's film, ``Mountains
of the Moon,'' which portrays Burton's endeavors and tragic
confrontrations with rival explorer John Hanning Speke.
   That Hollywood movie is one reason Rice's was the first Burton
book to reach best-seller lists.
   ``Clearly, publicity and promotion can turn the tide for a book,
and a movie tie-in always helps,'' says Gayle Feldman, an editor at
Publishers Weekly.
   Publisher Charles Scribner's Sons pushed the book, sending Rice
on book tours and national TV shows, and the biography got good
reviews throughout the media.
   Rice's book is, perhaps, the most comprehensive of the Burton
biographies. It quotes liberally from Burton's writings and puts a
lot of the explorer's life in the context of the times, drawing
upon Rice's considerable knowledge of Eastern religions and
cultures.
   Throughout, Rice's admiration of Burton is clear, and he makes
some controversial assertions. That Burton was a spy has not been
proven, though Rice ties scant evidence into a somewhat convincing
whole.
   Rice, who has written a dozen other books, also seems convinced
that Burton had a mysterious Persian lover whom he wooed, lost and
pined for the rest of his life.
   In perhaps his most contentious argument, Rice says Burton was a
devoted Moslem, maybe even a Sufi mystic. Scholars today heatedly
debate Burton's religious leanings, as did those who lived with and
near him.
   After Burton's death, his wife, a devout Catholic, burned the
personal diaries which may have solved the arguments.

<DATELINE>DOVER, New Jersey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Edward Rice was 13 when he first
encountered Sir Richard Francis Burton in the English explorer's
book, ``Wanderings in Three Countries.''
   Later, supporting himself as a free-lance photographer for the
United Nations, the World Health Organization and Town and Country
magazine, Rice spent about three years in India, traveled overland
1,800 miles up the Indus Valley in Pakistan, and went to Kenya and
Somalia, which Burton opened up to the West.
   ``Whenever I traveled, Burton was always there, because I turned
to Burton as a reference,'' says the 72-year-old Rice, whose
``Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton, The Secret Agent Who Made the
Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered the Kama Sutra and brought the
Arabian Nights to the West,'' is a surprise best seller.
   ``Just coincidentally, I was going to the same places that
Burton went.'' Coincidentally? ``Well, I don't know. Maybe Burton's
spirit was up there telling me, `You go here or there,'' he says,
and laughs, squinting through pale blue eyes under a shock of white
hair.
   Rice's health has plagued him. However, like Burton, the author
has persevered through near blindness and more.
   He signed a contract for the biography in 1979. By 1980, his
eyes were failing. By 1985, he was legally blind. Soon thereafter,
he underwent open heart surgery. He has had two eye operations.
   When he finally finished the book in 1987, his publishing house
was being overhauled, and his editor left. He took the book to
Charles Scribner's Sons, which published it.
   Rice may be one of the last Burton biographers who saw cities
the way Burton did. ``I was there just before westernization. ...
Baghdad, in 1966, just before Hussein. Damascas was an incredibly
beautiful Arabian Nights city. Now, it's full of high-rises built
by Arabian oil sheiks.''
   Rice is doubtful a Burton could exist today. ``He'd be the ideal
person to go into Iraq in disguise. He could have gone into Iran
during the hostage crisis and found out what was going on.''
   Author of a dozen other books, many about the Middle East or
Eastern religions, Rice is now working on a book about a central
Pakistan civilization. Lost in 1,500 B.C. but rediscovered in 1922,
the Indus Valley empire included the first known examples of
central planning, a grid plan and indoor plumbing, according to
Rice.

<HEAD>Red Cross Taking Heat for Handling of Disasters, Blood Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In taking on the presidency of the American
Red Cross, Elizabeth Dole is moving to the helm of an organization
that has known controversy from the days of Clara Barton to the era
of AIDS and the Loma Prieta earthquake.
   She isn't likely to face criticism for living in a tent and
directing operations from the field, as Red Cross founder Barton
did, but she could end up having easily as many battles on her hand
as she did in President Bush's Cabinet.
   After a year in which it faced record disaster expenditures, the
organization has taken heat not only for its handling of such
emergencies but for its role as a supplier of blood for
transfusions.
   ``Elizabeth Dole has the stature and talent to revitalize the
national Red Cross and make it the kind of modern helping force
necessary for disasters in the 1990's,'' San Francisco Mayor Art
Agnos said when the outgoing labor secretary was named to the new
job.
   ``From our experience in the Loma Prieta earthquake, it is
needed,'' Agnos added.
   Others echoed his view.
   ``When the national Red Cross has become involved in the past,
there has been a letdown in coordination,'' said Carl Bradford,
director of emergency services for West Virginia. ``The Red Cross
seems to function very well at the local level, but when national
comes in they do not work as well with state and local
governments.''
   Carol McArthur, press secretary to Oakland, Calif., Mayor Lionel
Wilson, was so upset by the Red Cross' performance after the Oct.
17, 1989, earthquake in Northern California that she resigned from
the board of the organization's Oakland and East Bay chapter.
   ``The local Red Cross was very, very efficient, but they had
national representatives breathing down their necks,'' Ms. McArthur
said. ``Mainly the problems had to do with individuals not
understanding the varied needs of the ethnically diverse community
we have here.''
   Jim Cassell, a media associate at Red Cross headquarters, said
the organization is making a study of its disaster services, due
for completion in March.
   ``We will look at all disasters, including the major ones of
last year, the earthquake on the West Coast and Hurricane Hugo in
the East,'' Cassell said. He said the study was in large measure
``due to our own interest in always improving our services ... and
not just in response to criticism from outside.''
   Richard Smith, vice president and general manager at the
organization's Eastern operations headquarters in Alexandria, Va.,
said, ``We have learned a lot of lessons we can put into our
operational planning right away.''
   ``Mostly our need is to try to streamline our training,'' he
said. ``At a time when emotions and passions can run rather high,
and then you bring augmented resources in from outside, it is very
challenging to make sure you do that so that feelings don't get
rubbed in the wrong way. Some people have worse skills than others
in doing that and we sometimes have moments of tension.''
   ``We had a difficult year, but all that assessment is being put
to our improvement,'' said Smith.
   In a separate initiative, the Red Cross announced in August that
it was substituting centralized management for its system of local
control in each of 54 blood service regions, which supply blood to
more than half the hospitals in the United States.
   The action followed months of scrutiny by the news media and the
Food and Drug Administration. In 1988, the Red Cross acknowledged
it distributed 24 pints of blood that had failed AIDS procedures
but said none of the blood was used and none carried the AIDS
virus. The FDA said the units were shipped by Red Cross centers in
Washington and Nashville, Tenn.
   Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said, ``The purpose of those
reforms is to help the Red Cross come into greater compliance with
our standards. We have an ongoing system of inspections, and so we
hope the improvements they are making will be reflected in those
inspections. We are very encouraged by the steps they are taking.''
   The American Red Cross is one of 150 national Red Cross and Red
Crescent societies affiliated with the International Committee of
the Red Cross, based in Geneva. In some countries, the society is
an arm of the government, but in the United States it is a private
organization supported by contributions.
   Congress gave the Red Cross a charter in 1918 to conduct
disaster preparedness and relief. There is no congressional
oversight, however.
   The American Red Cross has around 2,700 chapters, a paid staff
of 25,000 and more than 1 million volunteers. In 1989, it received
a record $165 million in donations and spent $151 million, more
than tripling the previous record. Its national office is in
Washington. It has operational headquarters for the East Coast in
Alexandria, Va., for the Midwest in St. Louis and for the West in
Burlingame, Calif.
   Clara Barton, a former schoolteacher and government clerk who
became a superintendent of nurses during the Civil War, founded the
group as the American Association of the Red Cross in 1881 and
became its first president.
   ``She was always very much hands-on when a big disaster
struck,'' said James Perry, a National Park Service ranger at the
Clara Bartoassifies as either palefaces or redskins. They are ``the
art for art's sake ivory-tower aesthetes who worry an abstraction
to death,'' as opposed to those ``who take their stance on raw
experience.'' Henry James, says Dickey, was a classic paleface.
   Here it comes.
   ``Clover Adams,'' he continues, grinning, ``said this about
Henry James: `Henry chews more than he bites off.' Ain't that
perfect?''
   James Dickey is the author of a shelf full of books, a wall full
of literary awards and served two terms as Consultant in Poetry to
the Library of Congress. He's probably most widely known for his
1972 novel and screenplay ``Deliverance.''
   But any student who expects so celebrated a writer to be a
remote or fragile sort strutting in his own importance could not be
more surprised walking into this classroom. A paleface James Dickey
is not.
   He comes to class in jeans and sneakers. He is big, 6-3, with
big forearms and a big voice and a paunch that covers his belt
buckle when he sits. He is 64, his thick sandy hair gone gray. His
speech is in an idiom and accent that, to borrow a phrase from a
brand new Dickey poem, is home-born Southern.
   His students are aware that James Dickey is a man of daunting
erudition but his artless earthiness masks this. At least they seem
at ease in his presence.
   ``I confess I was a bit shy about expressing an opinion at
first,'' said one student, Margaret Taylor. ``But he's why I'm
taking the class.
   ``When I went by his office to talk about signing up he asked me
who I was reading. I told him Robert Lowell and he immediately
quoted a whole stanza of Lowell and asked me what I thought of it.
I was, like, blown away. He's too much.''
   ``The man has a photographic memory,'' said another student,
Peter Harley. ``Name a poet and he'll tell you his favorite lines,
or something personal about them. He knows everybody. No, he's not
showing off, he makes the writers become real and interesting. You
wouldn't get that from someone else.''
   At one recent class, for example, Dickey was asking students
what authors they had chosen as the subjects for their papers.
   ``Margaret Gibson,'' one replied.
   ``Isn't she good, though?'' said Dickey. ``I thought `Long Walks
in the Afternoon' was her best. You should write to her. In fact,
if I like your paper I will insist that you write to her.''
   A student named a more obscure poet.
   ``Let me know if you can decide what he's writing about,''
Dickey said.
   The poet Edwin Arlington Robinson, Dickey's students learned,
was not only one of America's most admired in his time but also one
of its shyest.
   ``He had to drink himself into a conversation,'' remarked the
professor, ``and this is why he became one of the most monumental
drinkers in the whole spectacular history of American poetic
drinking,'' a category in which Dickey, at one time, but no longer,
might have included himself.

<TEXT>
   Historian Marvin Olasky looked at how American
society took care of its wretched poor 100 years ago and how it
does it now and concludes people did it better then.
   Charity in the 1890s, he said, was not left to the welfare and
charitable bureaucracies. Compassion was not dispensed with a
checkbook.
   Instead, he said, helping the poor involved ordinary working
people not much better off than those they helped. They took the
needy into their homes or into church basements - and showed them
the door if they refused to lift a hand on their own behalf.
   In a word, charity involved compassion, he said, an element that
is lost when helping the poor is left to institutions.
   Olasky, a University of Texas professor of journalism history,
is on leave as a scholar in residence at an anti-abortion group,
the Americans United for Life Legal Defense Fund.
   He is writing a book on the role of compassion and spent a year
at the Library of Congress digging into newspapers and magazines,
studying how paupers were treated a century ago.
   Then, for contrast, he spent a few days walking around
Washington, posing as a homeless person. In shelters, he said, he
got plenty to eat but no one ever suggested that he do anything for
himself. At one shelter, he said, he asked for a Bible and got a
stare instead.
   In an article in Policy Review, quarterly magazine of the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, Olasky
asks whether society is better off now than it was when charity was
a function of individual responsibility. He concludes that then was
better than now.
   But Robert Bothwell, executive director of the National
Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a nonprofit organization
that monitors the world of charity, has some doubts. Our
industrialized society, he said, has eliminated many jobs formerly
done by the unskilled poor.
   Olasky's thesis is that the way the poor are helped now is
expedient but ultimately unhelpful.
   ``The major flaw of the modern welfare state is not that it is
extravagant, but that it is too stingy,'' he writes. ``It gives the
needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone. It gives
the rest of us the opportunity to be stingy also, and to salve our
consciences even as we scrimp on what many of the destitute need
most - love, time, and a challenge to be `little lower than the
angels' rather than one thumb up from monkeys.''
   But most significantly, he said, a century ago people ``made
moral demands on recipients of aid. ... They did not allow anyone
to eat and run.''
   A century ago, Olasky writes, charitable people, often poor
themselves, provided food, shelter, work, organized excursions and
summer camps, staffed dispensaries and ran schools, missions and
reading rooms.
   New York City alone had 1,288 charitable organizations. Many
looked after members of their own nationality group.
First-generation Italians took care of newly arrived immigrants
from the homeland; the same was true of Swedes, Irish, Russians.
   Some charities had remarkably no-nonsense names, such as the
Erring Woman's Refuge or the Union for Homeless and Friendless
Girls.
   Women volunteers worked by day, men by night.
   These principles, Olasky said, prevailed:
   -Before someone received a handout, an effort was made to find
family members who could care for him.
   -Longterm, one-on-one contacts were forged between the volunteer
and the needy person.
   -Charity went only to those ``worthy of relief'' - those poor
through no fault of their own and unable to change that situation
quickly: the aged, ill and children. The ``shiftless and
intemperate'' were classified ``not entitled to relief'' and shown
the door. Before a man got a meal, he was asked to spend two hours
chopping wood; a needy woman was shown to the sewing room.
   ``Woodyards next to homeless shelters were as common in 1890,''
said Olasky, ``as liquor stores are in 1990.''
   -Relief was given only after investigation; ``benign suspicion''
was applied to those seeking aid.
   -Freedom from dependency was crucial. ``The goal of charity
workers,'' said Olasky, ``was to show poor people how to move up
while resisting enslavement to the charity of governmental or
private masters.''
   -Charity had religious underpinnings. Groups such as the
Industrial Christian Alliance didn't hesitate to remind the poor
``that God made them and had high expectations for them.''
   In an interview, Olasky spelled out his conclusions: ``It all
comes down to your understanding of what compassion is. Mutual
obligation was essential. The person who was better off was
obligated to `suffer with,' not just write a check or pass a law.
And the person who needed help was obligated to change.
   ``Now, if your definition of compassion is merely the provision
of material help, then you're not going to like my suggestions.''
   Bothwell, of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy,
is somewhat skeptical. He welcomes Olasky's ``holistic'' remedy -
charity should treat the whole person, not just a segment of the
problem - but makes the point that society has changed in
fundamental ways.
   In 19th century cities, sweatshops provided jobs for unskilled
immigrants. The gap between workers and nonworkers was not great
and an unemployed person could easily move into the ranks of the
respectfully employed by taking such a job.
   Today's counterpart job, Bothwell notes, might be flipping
burgers in a fast food restaurant, but that kind of work doesn't
pay enough to lift a family from poverty.
   It is true, Bothwell said, that society, in this era of busy
lives and two-income families, largely has turned over to
government the responsibility of providing a safety net. But, he
said, Olasky overlooks the enormous amount of private help that
still exists in a country with more than 800,000 non-profit
organizations.
   Moreover, today's immigrants - now likely to come from the
Soviet Union, East Europe, Latin America or Asia - still find
nationality groups to give them a lift. Newcomers still move in
with those who proceeded them.
   ``Everybody knows that we've grown into a society that is much
more distant than the world Olasky describes,'' Bothwell said. ``So
you devise different ways of assisting people, and one of them is
the more distant, more automatic way of providing money to the
destitute through the government's safety net.''

<TEXT>
   Jean Kahn, president of the Representative Council of Jewish
Institutions in France, issued a statement in August saying,
``Manifestations of anti-Semitism in France have sometimes been
over-dramatized in other countries.''
   ``We feel this is not justified, because it does not reflect
French reality,'' the statement added. ``Except for the tragic
period of 1939-45 ... the Jews of France for the last 200 years
have been completely integrated into the national community.''
   Crozier says, ``The Jewish element is part of the French
identity, as it is part of the American identity. We can accept
anyone, provided he accepts our culture. That's why the Moslems are
such a problem. They have a culture of their own which we do not
recognize.''
   Some sociologists and others say this sense of insecurity
explains the rise of the extreme-right National Front party of
Jean-Marie Le Pen. Le Pen contends that traditional French values
are being corrupted by foreign influences.
   Le Pen, who wants to deport North African immigrants, says
France risks becoming an Arabic-speaking, Moslem nation if
immigration is not stemmed.
   The National Front, the most powerful far-right group in Europe,
consistently holds about 15 percent of the electorate.
   France inherited its Moslem population, mainly North African,
from its disintegrating colonial empire. Thousands were lured
across the Mediterranean from 1960 to 1975 to man the factories
during an economic boom.
   Tin-roofed shantytowns that sprung up around major cities to
house the workers eventually were razed to make way for concrete
apartment buildings. Cut off from city life, ill-managed and
deteriorating, these high-rise complexes remain the principle
source of housing for immigrant families.
   ``This is a basic problem which will weigh for years on our
society,'' said President Francois Mitterrand in response to
October riots in a low-cost housing complex outside Lyon. The
projects ``provoke rejection, despair and make dialogue
difficult.''
   ``At the moment, it's hard to find a real Frenchman,'' said a
35-year-old Algerian. ``They're all rich and removed.''
   The Algerian, who refused to give his name, owns the Cafe Balzac
at the corner of two housing complexes near Vitry, south of Paris.
He has lived in France since he was a baby but refuses to exercise
his right to become a French citizen.
   ``They exploited my parents, they have done nothing for me,'' he
said. ``We are badly viewed, so why accept something they don't
really want to give you? I have my pride.''
   Many Algerians feel they are an unwanted reminder of the
inglorious eight-year war France vainly waged to keep Algeria a
colony.
   France tried early on to rid itself of what clearly was becoming
the immigrant burden, arranging to pay off workers and their
families willing to return to their homeland. The program largely
failed and officials now grope for ways to promote cultural
integration.
   The immigrant question shares the political agenda with the
``new Europe,'' an interloper of another sort.
   France has been a driving force toward unity, challenging the
European Community to go beyond the open frontiers of 1992 toward
political union.
   But the bravado masks worries that are particularly French - how
to remain rigorously independent in an interdependent community of
nations and retain the national identity that is, it often seems,
France's ``raison d'etre.''
   ``France currently is facing its most profound identity crisis
since the advent of the Fifth Republic (in 1958),'' according to
Gregory Flynn, a European affairs specialist with the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
   The French, he wrote in The Wall Street Journal, ``fear for
identity more than security'' and worry about losing all traces of
their status as a world power.
   France appears well-placed to assume a leadership role in a
united Europe, but questions arise about its willingness to
suppress its nationalistic instincts.
   ``Everything is happening as though the French, no longer able
to change the world or protect themselves from it, persuaded
themselves that as a nation they can do nothing at all,'' says the
government-ordered report on the state of the nation.
   The French have long sought to protect their national identity,
politically and culturally, the report says. ``From now on, they
will have to choose other criteria for success.''
   Many experts are optimistic.
   Todd, a member of the government panel, says France has far more
confidence now than a few decades ago, when the folly of grandeur -
``a perverse national obsession'' - bolstered a humiliated nation.
   ``France is one of the European countries changing most
quickly,'' Todd says, ``so it's normal that some people have
doubts, nostalgia, dream of a peaceful and tranquil France.''
   Crozier says, ``You don't redefine what is French. It's not an
intellectual operation. It's something that just happens.''

   He recommended to the class a collection of Robinson poems for
which he had written an introduction some years ago. ``I read this
through last night to see if I agree with myself, which I don't
always, and I must say I do, so it's safe.''
   Later Dickey was reading from the critic Edmund Wilson, who
wrote in passing that he thought Emily Dickinson was overrated.
Dickey's eyes left the page, rolled upward, and he shook his head.
   ``No, no, Edmund. You're wrong about that, dead wrong,'' he
said, then continued reading.
   ``Mr. Dickey has opinions all right,'' said a student, Alan
Asnen. ``You have the feeling he knows what he's talking about. I
think he knows ... everything. He certainly knows poetry, and loves
it.''
   Dickey at one moment appears hard and demanding and at the next
soft enough to cry on.
   Lecturing from his place at the head of the table, he rarely
glances at the notes spread before him. Instead, as he talks, his
gaze flits from face to face, lighting on each randomly, like a
pollenating bee.
   When he reads a poem aloud he yields completely to the lust of
language and rhythm and imagery. The effect sifts through the room
like perfume. He caresses each word, his soft voice adding its own
poetic sauce. At the end, he holds the final lines in his mouth,
tasting them, and raises his face to the class with a spreading
glow of satisfaction.
   ``Cut,'' he says at last, ending the spell. ``Go to black, or
whatever it is they say in Hollywood when it can't get any
better.''
   James Dickey, Georgia born, has been writer in residence at the
University of South Carolina for 23 years now. But he is no campus
decoration, seen only at book signings and sherry parties. Clearly,
he loves the classroom.
   ``A lot of American writers feel that teaching is an imposition
keeping them from their work,'' he says. ``I don't. Teaching forces
you to get your own ideas straight. They vary from year to year,
but when you get in front of a classroom you at least have to say
what you think and how you feel.''
   So Dickey teaches two courses, four classes twice a week,
although the school has asked him to drop one, a workshop on modern
American poetry, to give him more time to write. Lack of time,
however, doesn't seem to have hampered him so far. He has eight
projects in the works, including a sequel to his 1987 novel
``Alnilam'' which he considers ``20 times better'' than
``Deliverance.'' He's also working on a book of collected poems, a
book of literary criticism and a fourth children's book.
   Just last month he brought out a book of poems titled ``The
Eagle's Mile'' which he brought with him to class.
   ``There will be a signing at the bookstore Saturday,'' he said.
Then he added in a conspirator's whisper, ``I'm going to take
roll.''
   Then he reminded the class of aspiring young poets yearning to
be published of what the poet Conrad Aiken said about bringing out
a new book of poetry.
   ``He said waiting for the reaction is like dropping a feather
into the Grand Canyon and listening for the echo.''
   James Dickey continued:
   ``For everybody in this class I wish only one thing, that you
concentrate your efforts to one end.
   ``Not to publish. Not to be famous. Not to make money, because
that just ain't going to happen no matter how good or famous you
are.
   ``Concentrate all your energies toward writing something that
will stand up, that will move people, that will stay with them,
disturb them, amplify what used to be called their souls.
   ``Do that. Do that. There is hope for all of us.''
   Class dismissed.

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - James Dickey can trace his long rise to
the heights of American letters to a single word in a single line
of a forgotten sonnet by an obscure poet.
   He recalled the occasion recently during a poetry class at the
University of South Carolina.
   ``I was a young Air Force pilot in Okinawa during World War II.
I was sitting by the bay overlooking a graveyard where thousands of
Americans were buried, and there were no flowers.
   ``I had with me an anthology of poems. One of them was by Joseph
Trumbull Stickney, who had died when he was 30, just when he was
getting going. It contained this line about the pagan god Apollo:
   `... And all his island shivered into flowers.'
   ``I thought that was truly unusual, truly remarkable. Shivered
into flowers. Shivered.
   ``I thought, maybe I could do something like that. Maybe. Maybe.
   ``I decided to try.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - The torch is being passed in Singapore, the
former British colony that has become one of Asia's most prosperous
nations under the authoritarian rule of Lee Kuan Yew. After more
than three decades, Lee on Nov. 28 will relinquish his post as
prime minister to Goh Chok Tong, who, like George Bush, is
promising a ``kinder and gentler'' country.

   In his 31 years as prime minister of Singapore,
Lee Kuan Yew ruled as a no-nonsense, stern taskmaster.
   ``We decide what is right,'' he once said. ``Never mind what the
people think.''
   There were no free lunches. Fun and games had to have a purpose
and, hopefully, show a profit.
   Now that Lee is stepping down, his successor says that the time
has come to lighten up.
   First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is scheduled to take
over on Nov. 28. He says he plans no radical change but will scrap
the paternalistic approach and ``loosen the reins'' of government
   ``The society which we want to bring about will be more refined,
more compassionate, kinder and gentler,'' Goh promised.
   Under Lee, the former British Colony of Singapore began its
existence as an independent city-state with a weak economy, no
industry, unfriendly neighbors and bitter racial divisions among
Chinese, Malays and Indians.
   Today Singapore, with 2.7 million people, is one of Asia's most
prosperous nations.
   Described as authoritarian even by his admirers, Lee offers no
apologies for his hard-nosed methods.
   ``No leader can be a softy and hope to survive,'' the world's
longest-serving elected government head told university students
recently.
   ``The largest single difference in style between Goh Chok Tong
and me will not be because of differences in temperament or
character, but because of his commitment to team leadership. He
consults all ... key parties affected before he takes major
decisions.''
   Lee said several years ago that his political heirs sometimes
did not seem tough enough to handle the opposition and other
critics. ``Have they got enough people with that fire in the belly
and iron in the soul?''
   Goh has a quick brain and is decisive but tries to please too
many people, Lee said with typical bluntness.
   Lee nevertheless planned an orderly transition of power to a new
generation. But he admitted publicly in 1988 that he preferred
Education Minister Tony Tan instead of the amiable Goh as his
successor. Tan did not aspire to the role.
   While relinquishing the prime minister's title, Lee, 67, expects
to remain politically active. He will serve in Goh's cabinet as
senior minister without portfolio and continue as chairman of the
ruling People's Action Party.
   ``It is to Singapore's advantage that he should remain as a
factor in our domestic politics, and even in our foreign
relations,'' Goh said.
   As the elected head of the People's Action Party, Lee became
prime minister and controlled who was named to cabinet positions.
He also had the power to choose his successor.
   Under the constitution, elections are held at intervals not to
exceed five years.
   The constitution is being amended to elect and give executive
powers to the now-ceremonial and appointed presidency. Lee
suggested the change in 1984 to help safeguard the country's vast
financial reserves.
   He has not ruled out the possibility that he might seek the
revamped post after President Wee Kim Wee retires.
   The Lee factor in Singapore politics was also reflected by Goh's
appointment of Lee Hsien Loong, 38, the prime minister's eldest
son, as one of two deputy prime ministers in the new government.
   The appointment came as no surprise. Goh earlier acknowledged
that the younger Lee was his logical successor as prime minister.
But Goh, 49, insists that he will not serve in a transitional role
to keep the seat warm for the ambitious Lee.
   ``There is no such arrangement,'' Goh says.
   Lee Hsien Loong is the cabinet member in charge of trade and
industry. He entered politics in 1984 after a 13-year army career
in which he moved through the ranks from cadet to brigadier
general.
   ``There will be life after Lee Kuan Yew because we have a team
of men who are just as determined as Lee Kuan Yew was when he
started building Singapore,'' Goh says.
   Against heavy odds, Lee turned an unpromising relic of the
British Empire into a glittering commercial success and test tube
for social change.
   ``Fortunately for us when we set out to organize ourselves in
the 1960s, we did not believe in pie in the sky,'' Lee told a
recent gathering in his Tanjong Pagar constituency. ``We went in
for equality of opportunity but not equal pay. That made everybody
do their best.''
   The Cambridge-educated lawyer took charge in 1959 when the
colony gained limited self-rule. It joined the new Malaysian
Federation in 1963 only to be expelled two years later because Lee
and other Chinese leaders were seen as a threat to the political
control of indigenous Malays.

   Lee lamented at the time that his country was ``the smallest of
shrimps in a sea of hungry fish.''
   Few states faced sovereignty in such dismal circumstances.
Unemployment, poverty and ethnic tensions were rife. The economy
was weak and the armed forces ineffective. Indonesia was
threatening military action against Malaysia and Singapore.
   ``I say without the slightest remorse that we wouldn't be here,
we would have not made economic progress, if we had not intervened
on very personal matters - who your neighbor is, how you live, the
noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use,'' Lee once
said in a speech.
   More than half of the present citizens were born during Lee's
tenure and more than 80 percent have known no other leader during
their adult lives.
   His assorted views and prejudices, on matters ranging from good
neighborliness to genetics, have over the years assumed the force
of law. Some are resented as quirky or intrusive, but are not
seriously challenged.
   Those who challenged Lee's leadership found themselves subject
to arrest, detention without trial, public humiliation and general
harassment by a government reluctant to acknowledge dissent.
   He has survived in confrontational politics to the point that he
is respected and regarded with awe, but not love. That appears to
be the image he prefers, in much the way of an emperor in Imperial
China.
   In answering foreigners who criticize his tough treatment of
opponents, Lee once told an interviewer that the Chinese people
have no concept of a loyal opposition. Their support is firm even
if you detain people without trial, but once that support is
withdrawn it is sudden and complete, Lee said.
   ``If you break faith with them and lose your mandate, you've had
it. It will go completely the other way.''
   An island about the size of Chicago, Singapore has no natural
resources except a strategic location and the skills of a
multiracial population.
   Lee demanded discipline to overcome hardships. Obedience, hard
work, cleanliness, thrift and the profit motive all played a part
as a shabby colonial backwater was transformed.
   Years of firm political leadership and stable economic growth
helped attract investment by multinational corporations seeking a
doorway to the booming markets of the Asia-Pacific region. Now it's
a thriving financial and manufacturing center with high-tech
industries, first-class schools and glitzy shopping centers.
   The Lee administration has a reputation for honesty, efficiency
and a strong sense of direction. Standards are high and there is a
strict moral code.
   ``Do not try to get a government on the cheap. Money politics
will result in a poor bunch of MPs (members of Parliament), plus a
lot of hypocrisy, fiddling and eventually dishonesty and
corruption,'' Lee told the country on Aug. 8, in his final National
Day address as prime minister.
   Tipping, jaywalking, littering and discourtesy are officially
denounced. Those who neglect to flush public toilets after use may
be fined.
   Those suspected of more serious transgressions such as
subversion and drug abuse can expect no mercy. Suspected
subversives can be detained indefinitely under the Internal
Security Act without being charged or put on trial. Dozens of
convicted drug traffickers have been hanged.
   Lee has described his role in recent years as that of
``chairman'' of a city-state run on corporate lines. Cabinet
ministers act as executive directors, largely untroubled by
ideological issues or domestic political infighting. They are
chosen less for their appeal among voters than their capacity to
manage a department effectively.
   ``The danger now is that many believe that wehave arrived and
can therefore relax. In that case standards will go down and we
will lose out. As long as we do not forget this, we need not fear
the future,'' Lee said.

   ``Cadillac Man'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.98. Rated R)
   
   Robin Williams may well be in agreement with the Los Angeles
Lakers on the proposition that you can't win them all.
   Coming off Academy Award nominations for ``Good Morning,
Vietnam'' and ``Dead Poets Society,'' it appeared the hyper comic
could do no wrong. Alas, he throws a piston with ``Cadillac Man.''
   Williams is far too inventive a performer to fail completely.
But his protean talents are straitjacketed as Joey O'Brien, a
charmless, sex-crazy car salesman whose redemption comes too late.
   ``Cadillac Man'' begins promisingly. Under the titles, a
helicopter shot focuses on the New York skyline, then across an
endless landscape of gravestones. On the edge of the cemetery, a
funeral procession is stalled by a disabled hearse.
   Enter Joey, who sells cars with the zeal of Michael Milken
peddling junk bonds. He befriends the mortician and presents a
card. When he tries the same with the widow (Elaine Stritch in a
funny bit), she calls him a sleaze.
   That's what he is, all right. Joey will say anything to sell a
car. Meanwhile, he tries to service two mistresses - one a married
woman (Fran Drescher), the other a ditsy would-be designer
(Annabella Sciorra), placate his ex-wife (Pamela Reed) and stay out
of the clutches of a debt-collecting mafia boss (Bill Nelson). Joey
also faces an impossible sales quota or he's fired.
   The tedium of Joey's travails ends with a crash: Tim Robbins
smashes the showroom door with his cycle. He brandishes an
automatic weapon, madly seeking the lover of his wife, who works at
the agency.
   Are hostage situations a likely source of comedy? After watching
the nightly news you might not think so. Williams and Robbins
strive mightily to make it work, and almost succeed. The rangy,
wild-eyed Robbins, impressive as the feckless minor leaguer in
``Bull Durham,'' somehow ingratiates as the reluctant terrorist.
   The two stars and the large supporting cast get little help from
Ken Friedman's lusterless script or from Roger Donaldson's
haphazard direction. The filmmakers seem to believe that loud is
funny. It ain't.

   Paul Young says ``Other Voices,'' his first album in two years,
represents a change in musical direction. But it's hard to hear
much difference between the best material on this album and Young's
best-known songs from the past, including his huge 1985 hit,
``Everytime You Go Away.''
   Young's strength is his passionate way with a soul tune. He's in
fine form here with a tasty cover of the 20-year-old Chi-Lites hit,
``Oh Girl'' and a muscular production of Peter Wolf's ``It's What
She Didn't Say,'' a song co-written by Young.
   One wonders, though, why Young doesn't stick with what he does
best. Instead, ``Other Voices'' is a grab bag of styles, with a
different producer on almost every track.
   It also features a long roster of guest artists: Chaka Kahn,
David Gilmour, Steve Winwood, Peter Wolf and Stevie Wonder, among
others.
   But the guest stars hardly shine and this likeable album would
have been better with a bigger dose of soul.

   French eelodies (EMI) - Jose Van Dam, baritone, Jean-Philippe
Collard, piano
   Songs, piano works, by Reynaldo Hahn (Ades) - Jean-Christophe
Benoit, baritone; Bernard Ringeissen, piano
   
   Italy in the 19th-century never really answered the German lied,
preferring to let its voices excel in opera. The French, with their
``melodies,'' did a better job.
   Two recent CD releases, in very different ways, give a taste of
a form that began with Berlioz, gloried in Debussy, Ravel and Faure
and continued through Les Six, that rebellious collection of French
composers after World War I which included Poulenc.
   Hahn (1875-1947), a now obscure Frenchman of Venezuelan descent,
wrote operas, operettas and ballets and conducted in the theater
during his maturity. But his guarantee against oblivion are songs
written when Hahn was a teen-ager and in his early 20s.
   Benoit offers 19 of them around a five-piece piano solo
interlude. They are plenty charming in the best Parisian salon
sense, but frequently Hahn rises above that with some truly
beautiful writing. It's hard to resist them.
   Benoit's voice has an open, appropriate drawing-room quality,
but it wavers and sounds a little unsteady. His pitch sometimes has
the same problem. But the performances are genuine and
affectionate, the recorded sound has immediacy and Rengeissen is
always sensitive. Ten demerits to Ades for providing no text.
   Of a wholly different vocal order is Van Dam. His voice has a
beautiful, rich quality, in which the vibration is a natural
outgrowth of the core of his sound, a quality which Benoit lacks.
Van Dam brings strong characterizations to this varied survey,
which includes songs by Berlioz (his famous ``Les Nuits d'Ete''),
Ibert, Faure, Poulenc and Ropartz.
   Van Dam defines dynamic control - producing tightly reined
crescendos and diminuendos. The highlights are the Ibert songs on
poems about Don Quixote, who Van Dam portrays with a melancholy
nobility, and Poulenc's baudy Chansons Gaillardes, based on
anonymous 17th-century texts of a Rabelaisian flavor. The program
is well put together: the wide-eyed piety of Faure's ``At Prayer''
immediately precedes the first Poulenc number, about a fickle
mistress and her virginity. Collard is exceedingly elegant
throughout. Text and translation provided.

<HEAD>Star Watch: ``Sibling Rivalry'' and Parent-Son Rivalry</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Reiner was in an especially jovial mood the
other day during one leg of a daunting, nationwide promotion tour
for his new film, ``Sibling Rivalry,'' that would have tired a man
half his age.
   But Reiner, tall, trim and as busy as ever at 68, still looks a
lot like his most well-known character, Alan Brady, the arrogant,
variety show host on the old ``Dick Van Dyke Show.''
   His good humor was evident despite decidedly mixed reviews about
the movie, his latest film in a career that spans 40 years and
includes such TV and movie comedy classics as ``Your Show of
Shows'' ``Where's Poppa,'' ``All of Me'' and ``The Jerk.'' Reiner
directed ``Sibling Rivalry.''
   The critics have not been not especially kind to the comedy,
which stars Kirstie Alley and involves a man who died during sex
with her and the various cases of mistaken identity that occur as a
result.
   The title refers to three sets of siblings in the film and how
they interact and compete with with each other. Familial rivalry is
a familiar subject to Reiner. Both with his own brother, who he
credits with pushing him into show business, and his famous son,
Rob.
   ``The prospect of a new Reiner comedy is a lip-smacking one. Rob
Reiner, that is. Not papa Carl, whose best comedies were made years
ago,'' wrote the New York Post film critic in panning ``Sibling
Rivalry.''
   Carl Reiner does not dispute those sentiments.
   ``Rob had the toughest time of all my kids,'' he said. ``He
wanted to be in show business and he had a father who was going on
all cylinders. He was in competition with me and he was impatient.
Then he ended up outrunning Dad.''
   Reiner lists his son's movies with pride, saying, ``he's been up
at bat six times and you can't find anything really wrong with his
work.''
   Reiner also said that his son ``outstripped me as far as acting,
too. Whenever they'd see us on the street, they'd start yelling,
`hey Meathead!' One time, somebody called him Meatloaf and I yelled
back, `no, it's Meathead!'''
   According to Carl Reiner, family members have always been
competitive with each other - but they've also remained loyal.
   Reiner's brother, Charlie, who owns a printing business in
Atlanta, was always the ``funnier one'' when they were growing up
in the Bronx, the sons of a watchmaker.
   ``But Charlie suffered because I was the more quiet, studious
one and my mother would always say, `why can't you be more like
your brother, Carl?' We still talk about it.''
   But it was his brother who urged him to enroll in drama school
and become an actor. And his brother still religiously tapes all
Reiner's appearances on TV and saves all news clippings about him.
``Everytime I'm on Carson, he still tapes it,'' said Reiner.
   Reiner's other two children are daughter, Annie, a playwright
and artist, and Lucas, who directed the film, ``Spirit of '76.''
   ``My other kids have had a problem with it,'' said Reiner of
both his success and Rob's. ``Annie was showing some of her work
recently and the first people who greeted her at the door said
`aren't you Carl Reiner's daughter?' She's trying to have to her
own identity. You want to make it on your own.''
   But Reiner said his family is very close-knit, despite the
inherent rivalries, and often gather for dinners at the Beverly
Hills home he shares with wife of 47 years.
   Estelle Reiner played the woman in the deli in Rob Reiner's
film, ``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' who said, ``I'll have whatever
she's having,'' in the memorable scene in which Meg Ryan faked an
orgasm.
   The Reiner family has a history of inserting relatives and other
autobiographical details into their work. Carl Reiner's most
celebrated comedy, ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' was set in New
Rochelle, N.Y., where he lived with his wife after their marriage.
And Van Dyke character was, of course, named Rob, after you know
who.
   But even if he believes Rob has surpassed him as a director,
Carl Reiner is keeping as busy as ever. He continually sifts
through new scripts in search of a new movie to direct. He was
eager to return to Beverly Hills, where he's in the midst of a
novel about Hollywood.
   ``I'm a worker,'' he said. ``I've worked steadily all my life.
I've become venerable. I've gone through several incarnations but
I've kept current. There's a whole generation of adults who grew up
with me.''
   He and his wife live there year-round with the exception of six
weeks they spend in the South of France each year. Reiner's best
friend is Mel Brooks, with whom he wrote the legendary ``2,000
Year-Old Man.'' They have dinner together several times a week and
go out to movies.

<HEAD>The Artists: Sensitizing Viewers to Suffering and Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is a still life of sorts: a baby's
crib made of tightly bound strands of metal and a little cloth. It
is a square cage in which nothing goes in and nothing goes out.
   Artist Doris Salcedo sculpted this work about a woman who
continually washed her dead baby, who had been killed by death
squads in northern Colombia. She bathed the infant's cadaver,
applying creams and ointments.
   The crib symbolizes the mother's desperate acts, which Salcedo
called ``useless, but dignifying.''
   Bombs, massacres, kidnappings and disappearances are causing
angry Colombian artists to illustrate their country's nightmare in
paintings and sculptures.
   These artists paint scenes of army soldiers hovering above dead
bodies, animals devouring other animals and bleeding women crying
out for help. Sickened by Colombia's trauma, they say they want to
wake up people to the country's bloody reality.
   ``I want to sensitize people to the violence we're forced to
live in,'' Salcedo said. Many of her scupltures contain membrane
material (cloth made from the lining of animal intestines) because
she wants people to perceive the pain ``at skin level,'' she said.
   Tens of thousands of Colombians have died in the past decade in
violence ranging from peasant massacres to bombings by the Medellin
cocaine cartel.
   Much of the bloodshed has been blamed on right-wing death
squads, leftist guerrillas, drug traffickers and other armed
groups. Colombia also has a long history strife between political
parties.
   A war between the country's two biggest parties, the
Conservative and the Liberal, took at least 250,000 lives in the
early 1950s.
   Atrocities in that war were common, such as spilling live
captives from a dump truck over cliffs.
   Many artists who illustrate violent themes must make their
living by teaching, or rely on prize money. The works themselves
don't sell.
   Enrique Jaramillo set up a display entitled ``Children's Game,''
consisting of rifles made of scrap material and garbage. Powerful
imagery, but hardly living-room adornment.
   Many Colombian artists reject what they call the
``superficiality'' of mainstream, decorative art.
   Joseph Kaplan, 23, pointed to a painting he did of two faceless
animals, one overpowering the other in a mass of blood.
   ``This is not a pretty, decorative piece. But I hope it makes
people reflect on why I would paint it,'' he said.
   Many of Kaplan's works contain a ray of hope. Dark, violent
scenes often give glimpses of a brighter, more serene landscape.
   ``There's always an opening to a more colorful, surreal world,''
he said. Colombia's beauty is as powerful as its dark side.
   Kaplan's works sometimes reflect both his Jewish and Colombian
ancestry. In one painting, smoke hovers alongside a faint image of
a Star of David.
   Miguel Angel Rojas, winner of Colombia's most prestigious art
award in 1988, sometimes paints violence against indigenous
Colombian tribesmen.
   In one piece, a large male figure, carrying a coin and a
television, runs away from a tribesman. Rojas says it illustrates
modern society leaving the Indian behind.
   ``The indigenous are relegated to virtual death,'' the artist
said.
   In one painting, Rojas depicts a pre-Colombian Tumaco statue
above a huge, black oil stain. It's a protest against bombings by
leftist guerrillas of the country's main oil pipeline.
   The National Liberation Army has blasted the pipeline scores of
times since 1986, often causing oil to spill into nearby rivers.
   ``In this country, we have to construct, not destroy,'' Rojas
said.
   Another painter, Beatriz Gonzalez, sometimes puts powerful
newspaper images on canvas.
   When the body of a slain billionaire drug trafficker appeared in
press photos, Gonzalez painted the image. The cadavers of drug lord
Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, his son, Fredy, and three bodyguards
lie face-up on the ground.
   Rodriguez Gacha, considered the number two man in the Medellin
cartel, was shot dead by police last December. ``The image is of a
complete and total fall,'' Gonzalez said.
   At 52, Gonzalez is among Colombia's most celebrated artists.
   Rojas often gets his inspiration from the day's news as well.
Seeing a violent event in art is different from watching it on the
news, he said.
   ``In art, it takes on a poetic content,'' he said.
   It is a tragic poetry. Most of Salcedo's sculptures represent
objects left behind by victims of violence. She sculpts furniture,
clothing, a baby's crib -``the objects which force people to feel
their loved ones' absence,'' she said.
   In one exhibit, men's shirts made of white cotton cloth are
lined up in neat piles. Each pile has a metal rod piercing it,
running its length.
   Salcedo said the metal is ``wounding'' the soft material, as in
many of her scupltures.
   As she sculpted the shirts, Salcedo imagined she was the wife of
a peasant murdered last year during a massacre in Cordoba, a
northern banana-growing province.
   Violent art is not new in Colombia. Debora Arango caused a stir
in the 1940's by her paintings depicting vultures, victimized women
and people piled into box cars.
   In 1962, Alejandro Obregon won widespread acclaim for his work,
``La Violencia.'' In the painting, a white bird flies over a
mountain shaped like a pregnant woman with a bleeding breast.
   Despite the violence, Colombia has become a center for Latin
American culture. Major cities are filled with museums, galleries,
theaters and libraries.
   Gonzalez says she and other artists who depict violence are not
ideologues, just people with conscience.
   ``When viewers see my work, I hope they feel the violence deep
within. Sometimes it's the only way to move people,'' she said.

   Aiming his tenor sax at the sky above
the Pacific, Charles Lloyd blows shades of Bird, Bhudda and Bartok
much the same way he did when he and Keith Jarrett introduced jazz
to flower children during the 1960s.
   Lloyd's new album, ``Fish out of Water,'' is the first recording
by his new quartet and a more mature sound by the once-frenetic
performer who burned out in 1969 and headed for the California
coast to meditate.
   His free, airy, impressionist style that turned on hard-core
jazzers as well as rock fans is both personal and political, a
departure from elevator jazz or what he calls hip Muzak.
   ``It articulates the human condition, not just the surface
level, like popsicles and stuff,'' says Lloyd, who at 52 is graying
but otherwise youthful. ``It's a music about freedom.''
   ``Fish out of Water,'' his first since the early 1980s, ``is not
being stuck in the net; it's about leapin' out of it,'' says Lloyd.
Perhaps a flying fish that feels like a ``Bird'' - the nickname for
bebop sax great Charlie Parker.
   After an on-again, off-again career in the '80s, Lloyd says he
is back for keeps and has begun a string of more than a dozen
appearances in Europe, including jazz festivals in Paris, Brussels
and Madrid. This month he plans to record a new album in Oslo,
Norway.
   ``Fish,'' on ECM Records, is also a great soundtrack for a misty
fall morning drive through orange and avocado groves that lead to
Lloyd's hacienda-style home high above the coastline just south of
Santa Barbara.
   Lloyd walks out on his porch, clad in jeans, loafers and a blue
work shirt whose open front reveals a T-shirt with Chinese script
underneath. Lloyd, of African, Cherokee and Irish descent, says his
Indian blood links him to Asian roots via the Bering Strait.
   He excitedly shifts from subject to subject, thinking ahead of
himself as he tries to make several points at the same time,
explaining points with Bhuddist, Hindu, biblical and secular
allegories.
   ``Stuff goes by too fast to articulate,'' he says
apologetically.
   Born in Memphis on March 15, 1938, he was 8 years old when he
heard Charlie Parker, and told his parents ``get me a saxophone
'cause that's what I speak on.''
   ``I wanted to be expressing those fractions, this thing where
you get in between the cracks,'' he says.
   Parker died at the age of 34 in 1955 after years of drug abuse,
but Lloyd says, ``Gosh, you need some kind of relief from this
jackhammer society.'' Fifty yards away, stone workers were
jackhammering stones to build a new house on his property.
   Lloyd acknowledged that he experimented with drugs - ``I did
research in that manner'' - but only during the 60s.
   After playing with blues greats including Howlin' Wolf and B.B.
King in the '50s, Lloyd went to Los Angeles and got a master's in
music at the University of Southern California. There, he studied
under the late Bartok expert Halsey Stevens, and by night played
the club circuit with Ornette Coleman, Don Cherry and others.
   In 1960, at age 21, Lloyd joined Chico Hamilton's group, and
played with Julian ``Cannonball'' Adderly in 1964. The next year he
formed his own quartet with Keith Jarrett on piano, Cecil McBee on
bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums.
   His best-known composition, ``Forest Flower,'' was warm, upbeat
and at times chaotic, in which he dueled in dissonance with
Jarrett.
   It was one of the first jazz records to sell 1 million copies,
and along with the Montreux Jazz and other festivals the quartet
also played on the same stage as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and
Jefferson Airplane.
   Sweden, which produced Lloyd's new quartet, was ``like groupie
heaven'' in the '60s. ``Five million blond amazons,'' he says.
   Lloyd says members of his new quartet were teen fans in the 60s.
Jarrett's influence on pianist Bobo Stenson is very apparent. Palle
Danielsson is on bass and Jon Christensen on drums.
   In 1969, Lloyd was exhausted from 10 years of touring and
devastated by the death of his mother the same year.
   ``I was so-caled `successful' but my spirit wasn't happy,'' he
says, and he didn't want to ``die in beer taverns.''
   ``I was restless, intense, had great insecurities.''
   He left New York and moved to Malibu and Big Sur, studied
Eastern religions, was introduced to introduced to transcendental
meditation in the '70s by Mike Love of the Beach Boys.
   In the '80s, Lloyd recorded and toured on and off with pianist
Michel Petrucciani.
   Lloyd suffered a setback about four years ago when he had anodes
removed from his throat. Although a nonsmoker, he says his doctor
told him smokey clubs caused the benign growths. He is to stay out
of cloudy dives, limiting the venues he can play.
   ``Fish'' is much more low-key and mystical than Lloyd's
more-intense bebop chops of the '60s. The title track has warm,
airy tones, though with Lloyd's signature runs that pull a quirky
riff from the outer reaches of a scale.
   Another track, ``Haghia Sophia,'' or St. Sophia, is named after
a mosque in Istanbul that was once a church - symbolizing his
interest in East and West. Lloyd has a flute intro much reminiscent
of Paul Horn's recordings in the Taj Mahal.
   Lloyd's solos are sparing and thoughtful, eking out or bending a
tone, whispering a run, blending in with the rest of the quartet,
not dominating.
   ``Even when I wasn't playing, I was playing,'' he says. ``It's
deep solitude in the midst of activity. I spend my time in silence.
I walk these hills in quiet solitude.''
   Lloyd shares the serenity of his sage-perfumed mountain retreat
with his wife, Dorothy Darr, a Gauginesque painter who created the
album cover. They also have a home in Big Sur.
   He hopes his new album, his 25th solo recording and altogether
his 40th, ``inspires people to look deeper.
   ``Maybe one of them may be a scientist who says we don't need
fossil fuel; we can do it with steam, or solar,'' he says, ``or we
con't have to have so much homelessness or deprive people of
opportunity.
   ``I hear about people talking about jobs and S&amp;Ls and oil. Those
war cats - good thing they got that cat over there to fight (Iraq's
Saddam Hussein) 'cause otherwise that other stuff would be hitting'
the fan.
   ``Those cats need to hear the music,'' he says. ``You can tell
these cats can't swing.''
   What'll the new album sound like? Lloyd spins around on his
piano bench and begins fingering rich, warm, sometimes dissonant
chord progressions. Squinting, grimacing, head bowed into the keys,
he calls it his ``Bartok piece.''
   The record, he says, will be ``rustling more, like dry leaves.''
No doubt the tactful, nuanced windpower will come from the lungs of
a seasoned reed man.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Rollicking, Riveting Fiction - and Banjo Music</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DAVID SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With three novels in print and a fourth on
the way, Clyde Edgerton is supposed to be taking a break. So here
he is on stage, with banjo and piano, reading his often rollicking,
sometimes riveting Southern fiction.
   It's Southern fiction by an author who thinks the catch-all
category of ``Southern writer'' doesn't do justice to the diversity
of the region's literature. His own diversity was on display during
a recent reading at Agnes Scott College, where he is a visiting
writer this semester.
   Edgerton mixed music, a frequent topic in his work, with
passages from his novels about the comic elements of family life in
the South and the moments in which people reveal or struggle for
their souls.
   It's been a winning combination for Edgerton's books: ``Raney,''
``Walking Across Egypt'' and ``The Floatplane Notebooks.''
Algonquin Books declined to release exact figures, but sales of
``Raney'' in hardcover and paperback went well over 200,000 copies.
Publishers Weekly reported Ballantine paid six figures for
paperback rights to ``The Floatplane Notebooks.''
   All three novels have enjoyed enthusiastic reviews. Movie
options have been negotiated, although no productions are under
way.
   Success has transformed Edgerton from a college English teacher
squeezing in some longhand writing at 6 a.m. into a full-time
writer with his own word processor and basement office in Durham,
N.C.
   For now, though, Edgerton is popping in and out of Agnes Scott,
a liberal arts college for women, attending literary conferences
and readings and awaiting the February publication of ``Killer
Diller.''
   ``I'm taking my first break in 13 years from writing fiction,''
he said.
   Edgerton, 46, started writing in earnest after seeing Eudora
Welty, one of his favorites, reading a story on public television.
Scenes he saw or heard about became starting points.
   ``There will be an incident - a woman stuck in a chair, that
happened to my mother,'' Edgerton said. ``My family thought it was
the funniest thing they'd ever heard, so I went home and wrote a
short story, and it turns out the short story turned into a
novel.''
   The woman who was stranded when she forgot there was no bottom
in her rocking chair became Mattie Rigsbee, the elderly church lady
of ``Walking Across Egypt.'' She and the juvenile delinquent she
befriended will return in ``Killer Diller,'' which will be the
first of Edgerton's novels not to begin as a short story.
   ``I try not to think of themes and ideas when I write fiction. I
try to put interesting characters in interesting situations and
just keep writing,'' Edgerton said.
   But Edgerton does grapple with themes as profound as war -
reflecting his years as a reconnaissance pilot in Vietnam - and
racism. Racial prejudice, in particular, tests his ability to paint
his characters sympathetically while pointing out their faults.
   ``I have decided not to skirt the issue, simply because it's
real. It's hard to love a character who says `nigger' in a novel,''
he acknowledged, but he said it's a situation that parallels life.
   ``One of the greatest paradoxes in some Southerners' lives is
having people who would die for them - that is, their parents - who
are also people who say `nigger,''' Edgerton said.
   Carefully choosing his words to avoid any hint that he condones
racism, Edgerton said the thoughtless slurs used by otherwise
lovable characters may be put in perspective by the other ``isms,''
such as ageism or class prejudice, harbored by those who think
themselves above racism.
   ``When these characters are attacked for their racism, the
writer may speculate on how the attackers think of old people and
plumbers and painters and how they behave toward those people -
which raises the whole question of the meaning in behavior as up
against the meaning in words and labels.''
   Edgerton said he did not want to downplay ``the horror of racist
labels'' and pointed out ``The Floatplane Notebooks'' includes an
account of a lynching.
   Most of Edgerton's scenes, however, are warm; conflicts often
are hilarious. The title character from ``Raney,'' for example, is
a traditional young woman who has married a more worldly man. She
is somewhat alarmed when he swigs champagne on their wedding night
and is moved to terror by some of his other ideas for the evening.
   Edgerton delivered Raney's outraged account in an affected
accent to his Agnes Scott audience. His variety of voices, facial
contortions and run-on breathless delivery are reminiscent of
Garrison Keillor, the ``Prairie Home Companion'' radio star who
also writes sympathetic stories about rural characters, although
his are in the Midwest.
   Edgerton doesn't resist comparisons to Keillor (``we're both
tall,'' he joked), but he does object to the casual labeling of
authors as ``Southern writers.''
   ``Too often the analysis stops there, and all kind of
assumptions go with it. Careful readers ... know that there are
vast differences among the group referred to as Southern writers,''
he said.

   The years between his landmark movie ``Easy
Rider'' and his recent return to film prominence, were a waste,
says Dennis Hopper.
   ``The drugs and alcohol that I was involved with stopped me from
working, stopped me from being creative. The problem with being an
alcoholic and a drug addict is that you don't think it's happening.
You don't know that you're addicted and don't admit that you're
addicted. It's always somebody else's fault that you're not
working,'' he said.
   ``Those were wasted years. I've directed six movies now. I
should have directed 20. It's unfortunate, because all that was
ever important to me was the work. I justified my own addictions
because I was an `artist,' and all the great artists, of course,
were drug addicts and alcoholics. Because of that stupidity, I
don't yet have a body of work that I consider important.''
   Hopper is striving to make up for lost time. His sixth film as a
director, ``The Hot Spot,'' starring Don Johnson, has been released
to hot and cold reviews and so-so business.
   While not in the Scorsese-Spielberg-Pollack range of directors,
he has no trouble finding employment, particularly for
hard-textured works such as his sensation-causing ``Colors'' (which
was blamed for scattered theater violence) and the current film, a
study of sex and crime in a small Texas town.
   ``This is a departure for me,'' he said. ``I actually used a
novel by Charles Williams. You might say we were of like mind. He
wrote the book in 1951, it was published in 1952. Then in 1962, he
wrote a screenplay with Nona Tyson; it was intended for Robert
Mitchum.
   ``I found that script and updated it to now. It's about an
amoral drifter (Johnson) who comes to a small town in Texas and
sells cars. ... It's a throwback to the film-noir dark movie, a
pulp novel. It's fun. I like it.''
   Johnson finds himself caught between two women, an oversexed
schemer (Virginia Madsen) and an innocent young beauty (Jennifer
Connelly) who is also manipulative. He also gets involved in bank
robbing, blackmail and murder - ``all the good stuff.''
   Hopper considered other stars before deciding on Johnson, late
of ``Miami Vice.''
   ``I edited the movie for a year, and now I can't imagine anyone
else playing the role,'' said the director. ``People should really
look at him as a force to be dealt with in movies. He could be a
major star. There's a place there for him.''
   He found Madsen while watching television via a satellite dish
during the filming of ``Flashback,'' in which he acted but did not
direct. He saw her as a throwback to Lana Turner, perfect for the
femme fatale role. He remembered Jennifer Connelly from her role as
a 12-year-old ballet dancer in ``Once Upon a Time in America.'' He
considers her ``more beautiful than Elizabeth Taylor and a better
actress.''
   Hopper talked about the notices for ``The Hot Spot,'' and said,
``It's getting some good stuff and some bad stuff. But I think that
runs with the territory. It's a hot movie. But then, I've always
gotten widely divergent reviews, starting with `Easy Rider.'
`Colors,' `Out of the Blue,' also. It sort of follows me around
like a pet snake.''
   Nothing in Hopper's background provided any hint of his later
notoriety. He was born in Kansas in 1936 and spent much of his
youth on his grandparents' farm five miles from Dodge City. His
parents moved to San Diego, where Hopper won a scholarship to the
Old Globe theater. A taste of Shakespeare emboldened him to try
Hollywood, and he landed a seven-year contract at Warner Bros.
   Hopper appeared in some impressive films: ``Rebel Without a
Cause,'' ``Giant,'' ``True Grit'' and ``The Sons of Katie Elder.''
After a few low-budget biker films with Peter Fonda, the pair
combined their forces in ``Easy Rider.'' The film's gritty realism
revolutionized the industry. Its success also contributed to
Hopper's 15-year tailspin.
   Hopper savors his new life: ``I'm married (to dancer Katherine
LaNasa, 31 years his junior), I have a new son, Henry Lee, born in
September. I have two daughters. The 17-year-old just entered
college; my 28-year-old is involved in film development here. I
couldn't be happier. The work is good, and I just want to keep
working. Those are the important things.''
   Dennis Hopper probably will never shed his reputation as a
world-class hellraiser of the '60s and '70s. Just recently a New
York tabloid captioned a photograph, ``Bad boy actor-director
Dennis Hopper ... ''
   Is he a bad boy?
   ``No, I don't think so,'' said the filmmaker, who resembled a
stockbroker in his expensively tailored suit. ``Maybe a bad
gentleman.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Peter Wolf Pushes On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE M. PETERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two decades in the music business both
as a disc jockey and a performer have given Peter Wolf a certain
maturity. Sort of.
   ``I tend to wear longer socks now,'' he jokes. ``And I look both
ways before I cross the street.''
   But seriously, the former J. Geils Band frontman has been
struggling since the 1983 breakup of the group to strike out on his
own.
   His most-recent solo album, ``Up to No Good'' was a critical
success but did not sell well. Now he's planning a tour to show
people he's still around.
   ``I haven't done it in eight years,'' Wolf said. ``The Beatles
were together and broke up in less time than that. In rock 'n'
roll, it's a millennium.''
   With J. Geils, Wolf's athletic antics onstage became as well
known as some of the band's songs, including ``Love Stinks'' and
``Centerfold.'' Then, at the height of the group's popularity, it
was announced that Wolf was leaving.
   Wolf said he's still bitter about the breakup, but added t
hasn't crushed his spirit.
   ``I became a soloist, really not by choice. But it was the only
way, a necessity, to keep on rock 'n' rollin' - because I loved the
band and I really would have liked to see the band stay together,''
he said.
   ``It was like someone who would have liked to see their marriage
stay together but there just wasn't any reason to hang in there.''
   Still, persistent rumors abound surrounding a J. Geils reunion,
especially every New Year's Eve, when the band used to play its
annual bash in Boston. Wolf is pessimistic about the prospects.
   ``The Geils band - we were a family, sort of like a bunch of
brothers sticking together through thick and thin. It just was hard
to try to keep that collective spirit,'' he said. ``People wonder
if the band is ever going to get back together, I really have no
set plans to do it. The only way I would do it is if I really felt
that kind of spirit could be regained. ''
   Recently, in a posh Boston hotel suite he took to meet the
press, Wolf looked unchanged from years of musical mayhem. The hair
may be shorter, but Wolf, 42, remains painfully thin, adorned with
eyeliner and dressed completely in black. His wit still is sharp.
   Wolf grew up in the Bronx. His father was an entertainer, his
mother a political activist, and the eclectic home life gave him
inspiration to be an artist. So he relocated to Boston in his early
20s to pursue painting.
   But art fell by the wayside when Wolf became the overnight disc
jockey at Boston's WBCN-FM and caught the music bug. It was there
that he met fellow musician Van Morrison.
   ``Van used to live in Cambridge and he used to listen, and
that's how we become friends. He used to come by and we ended up
doing gigs together,'' Wolf said. ``My band opened up for him and
we toured around New England together in station wagons.''
   In 1967, the J. Geils Band was born, taking its name from the
lead guitarist. Along the way there were moderate album sales, a
string of gigs opening for the Rolling Stones and the eventual
success of the 1982 album ``Freeze Frame,'' which sold 5 million
copies.
   But then came the unexpected breakup, with the band citing
so-called ``creative differences'' for the split.
   Wolf said he still prefers the group atmosphere, rather than
taking the risky solo route.
   ``I really enjoy being in a band. I enjoy the responsibility. I
enjoy sharing things. I enjoy the collaborative sense of it,'' he
said. ``It's a lot tougher being a soloist. There's a lot more
demands. All the focus is on one individual. I'm still not used to
that.''
   Wolf made two solo LP before ``Up to No Good.'' This time around
he decided to venture into unfamiliar territory for a rock 'n'
roller: Nashville.
   ``Many people think of it as just a country town - but there's a
lot of good rock 'n' rollers down there. And there's a lot of
studios.'' he said. ``So I thought it would be interesting to see
what it would be like to record outside of a big urban city like
New York or L.A. Once I started spending some time there I really
liked it.''
   He says the slogan on ``Up to No Good'' is a quote from a John
Lee Hooker song. ``If it's in you it's got to come out,'' sums up
his feeling about getting older, the business and his own
personality.
   ``To me, rock 'n' roll is infectious in the sense that - you
sometimes can't control it. It's something that's beyond the
senses,'' he said.
   ``You've got to really have that desire. As long as it's there,
you can keep on rocking.''
   Wolf was in Boston this October conducting interviews for
perspective band members. The tour, which does not have a firm
opening date, will likely take on small, intimate clubs. And
despite the years, Wolf said he's confident that on the tour he can
live up to the frantic stage persona he had with J. Geils.
   ``No one questions Frank Sinatra, who started out as a
bobby-socks idol, no one says, `Can he still be singing
``Witchcraft'' when he's 67?' Obviously he can because he's in his
70s and still doing concerts,'' Wolf said.
   But Wolf adds that he doesn't have plans to mellow.
   ``I don't think I'm going to be Perry Como in a sweater, holding
a pipe.''

   Those who come to celebrate the winter holidays in
this city at the heart of Christendom will find a happy combination
of spiritual tradition and modern-day hedonism sure to delight both
the faithful and the shopping-minded traveler.
   The Christmas season officially starts Dec. 8, the Feast of the
Immaculate Conception, when the pope blesses a statue of Mary near
the Spanish Steps.
   The whole city then comes alive as store hours and public
transportation schedules are extended so shoppers can search for
that perfect gift, seven days a week until as late as 9 p.m.
   Despite the lack of snow, Rome becomes its own kind of winter
wonderland. The city's streets, decked out in all their Christmas
finery, bask in the glow of holiday lights. One can stroll along
the elegant Via Veneto under twinkling tree branches and stop for a
steaming cappuccino or a hot chocolate at a sidewalk cafe.
   In Via dei Condotti, at the heart of the city's historic center,
one can wander down the red-carpeted street, window-shopping to the
sound of Christmas carols in the exclusive boutiques.
   Nearby in the Piazza di Spagna, those looking for more
traditional holiday sights will find a gaily decorated Christmas
tree and a beautiful example of the nativity scene, or ``presepe.''
   The creche is the most important symbol of Christmas in Italy,
and in addition to those on view in the city's major squares,
almost every Roman family displays one at home. Down the street
from the Piazza di Spagna in the Piazza del Popolo there is an
annual exhibit of more than one hundred nativity scenes from around
the world, made of everything from chocolate to shells to origami.
   The sacred meets the profane in Piazza Navona, where from Dec. 8
until Jan. 6 there is a huge open-air market. A brilliant array of
Christmas goodies are sold, from exquisite handmade figurines for
the nativity scene to Christmas stockings to toys and the customary
sweets for children, most notably the long spiral-shaped,
multi-colored lollipops known in Italian as ``spun sugar.''
   For Romans, the high point of the holiday is Christmas Eve. Woe
to the hungry tourist in search of an evening meal, as almost every
restaurant in Rome is closed after lunch on Dec. 24, when everyone
goes home to help prepare for the traditional ``cenone'' - the
Christmas Eve dinner - that Romans eat at home with their families.
   The holiday meal is based on seafood, and always consists of at
least four courses. Traditional dishes include batter-fried
broccoli and cauliflower, the classic Roman fried artichokes, pasta
with tuna, and ``capitone,'' a dish made with eel, all of which is
topped off by fresh fruit and cheese. The meal lasts from 8:30 p.m.
until around 11:30 p.m., when it is time to go to church for
midnight Mass.
   Be it for Romans or for tourists, nothing can be more moving
than attending midnight Mass at the imposing St. Peter's Basilica
in Vatican City.
   The ceremony is led by the pope, who reads his homily from under
the magnificent Bernini-designed canopy of the papal altar. Tickets
to the Mass are available free of charge but must be requested by
writing several weeks in advance to the Prefecture of the ``Casa
Ponteficio,'' Vatican City.
   After midnight Mass, families return home to drink spumante and
eat the special Christmas desserts: panettone, a kind of fruit
cake, and pan d'oro, a light sponge cake topped with powdered
sugar. Afterward gifts are exchanged, and the family sits down to
play various games such as cards or Tombola, an Italian version of
Bingo, often until sunrise.
   On Christmas Day, those who can rouse themselves after a long
night of festivities will go to the morning Mass, or to see the
pope deliver his annual Christmas message, ``Urbi et Orbi'' - Latin
for ``to the city (of Rome) and to the world'' - to the crowd in
St. Peter's Square.
   The holiday season continues through New Year's until Jan. 6,
after the Night of the Befana, a witch-like character said to have
arrived with the Three Kings at the stable where Jesus was born.
The custom of having presents beneath a Christmas tree brought by
``Babbo Natale,'' or Father Christmas, is relatively new, and many
families prefer the older tradition of the ``visit of the Befana,
who comes down the stovepipes'' to leave candy for good children
and lumps of charcoal for bad children in stockings hanging in the
kitchen.

   If it weren't for kids, there wouldn't be so many excuses for
adults to visit toy departments at holiday time. There are
thousands of toys marketed, so parents have plenty of fun ahead of
them before letting the youngsters take over. Here is the barest
sampling of what's in the stores:
   DOLLS. Classic baby dolls and what might be called role model
dolls prevail.
   - The Magic Nursery Baby has to arrive before its new owner can
determine its sex, just like a real baby. Each doll comes with a
homecoming garment that dissolves in water, revealing a packet with
a card that tells whether it's a boy or girl. Every 36th doll sold
will have a card that says it's a twin, and a second doll will be
on the way when the card is redeemed with Mattel, the maker.
   - If twins aren't enough, how about Quints? Five little dolls,
complete with accessories that are color coded (to tell them apart,
of course), come from Tyco Toys.
   - Then there's a new batch from the patch. Cabbage Patch Kids
with different facial features, eye colors, hair styles and skin
tones in as many variations as the owners themselves come in
Birthday Kids, Babyland Kids, Kids' Kids that pose, and Babies
reeking of baby powder. Now marketed by Hasbro, Cabbage Patchers
still come with their individual adoption certificates and
thousands of outfits to choose from.
   - Dolls heading out in the world include the Mommy Doll from
Tootsietoy, depicting the working mothers of real life. Briefcases,
jogging sweats, granny gowns, car keys, laundry baskets and babies
of their own accessorize these model moms. According to Cindy
Stern, who created the doll (with toy clothing designer Sue Ogden),
most mothers choose versions of the doll that most resemble
themselves.
   - Artistic aspirations are captured by My Pretty Ballerina by
Tyco Toys. This doll, dressed in tights and leg warmers, can dance
on point and execute arabesques or pirouettes. She comes with her
own practice barre. Separate accessories are performance ensembles
with costume pieces and cassette tapes with music from ``The
Nutcracker Suite'' and ``Swan Lake.''
   - What's a model of a model? It could be a doll from the Real
Model Collection by Matchbook Toys, fashion plates depicting
Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs or Beverly Johnson. Each doll comes
with portfolio, fashion changes, autographed pictures and beauty
booklet. The real Brinkley, Tiegs and Johnson are donating part of
their doll sales royalties to The Make-A-Wish Foundation.
   - Barbie probably is the Grande Dame of all fashion dolls, and
new versions from Mattel include the Ice Capades Barbie, Barbie and
The Beat, My First Princess, Wedding Fantasy, Air Force Barbie,
Barbie's All-Stars, Nigerian Barbie and Brazilian Barbie. Barbie
also has her first Bob Mackie gown, which the designer created for
the first in a series of collector Barbies.
   - Fashion consciousness has hit paper dolls, too. Lookin' Pretty
Dolls from Ohio Art come with press-on, peel-off vinyl fashions
that can be stored in their own carry-cases.
   - Old-world charm characterizes the Canneto Dolls from Hasbro,
made by a family in Italy. The dolls recall those grandmother had,
with country-print dresses trimmed in lace and flowers, straw or
lacy bonnets and floral bouquets. The dolls come with brushable
hair and soft bodies in baby dolls, toddlers, and little girls.
   CUDDLIES. Plenty of plush, but personalities are emerging.
   - A little fellow called F.R.O.Y.D. is sort of odd looking. He's
yellow, has a Cyrano-type nose and wears a button that says ``I
believe in you!'' He was discovered on a drawing pad one day by
former jewelry designer Carolyne Greene, who got him ready for his
debut in the toy world. F.R.O.Y.D. (for ``I'm for the reality of
your dreams'') says he was there to encourage Columbus, helping him
believe there really was something on the other side of the ocean.
He says he helped Thomas Edison see light bulbs, and Gorbachev find
a new way for Russia. ``Encouraging people to have the confidence
to make their dreams come true is my favorite thing to do. And I
don't need batteries. You can say the only accessory I come with is
your imagination.''
   - Another comforting character is Snobell, a reindeer in plush
from Applause. This pure white reindeer gets his name from the six
bells on his antlers that keep him from disappearing in the snow.
He has gray gloves and a green scarf with red tassels.
   - Also from Applause are Tiny Toons plush toys based on
characters in the Stephen Spielberg animated feature of that name.
These are teen-aged Bugs and Daffy offshoots, including Buster and
Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, Hamton, Dizzy Devil and Montana Max.
   - Now five years old and still going strong is Teddy Ruxpin, the
talking bear from Worlds of Wonder. Said to be the world's first
animated talking toy, Teddy communicates to kids with moving eyes,
mouth and voice from casettes. This year he comes up with some new
Adventure Series tapes and storybooks, including the Do-Along
Songbook and Fire Safety with Teddy Ruxpin.

   storybooks, including the Do-Along Songbook and Fire Safety with
Teddy Ruxpin
   - The Calico Cat and the Gingham Dog are reincarnated as a pair
of plush toys from Target Stores. They come in two sizes and are
accompanied by ``The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat Storybook''
(Random House), written by Brigid Clark and Chris Noel and
illustrated by Laszlo Kubinyi. All are based on the classic
children's poem by Eugene Field.
   - Hasbro has added to its collection of lifelike pets with Go-Go
My Walking Pup, a mechanized dog that can be taken for a walk.
   - And the Hug-A-Planet people (XTC Products) have come up with
Hugg America, a colorful, soft version of the 50 states. Shaped
like the continental states, the toy pictures the first 48 states
on one side and Alaska and Hawaii on the other.
   THE PLAYROOM. Even in this high-tech age, block sets remain the
classic starter toys.
   - The familiar colored plastic building brick sets from Lego
have some new twists: An M:Tron line, which includes magnetic
elements compatible with the basic Lego bricks, and a
glow-in-the-dark ghoul for Lego castle sets. Cannonball Clowns have
been added to the pre-schooler's Duplo circus sets.
   - Brio Scanditoys from Sweden feature colored elements to build,
too, but they come in wood and plastic rings, pegs, and other
shapes. There also are wooden railways, trucks, and kits full of
things like gears, nuts and bolts, rings, valves and tools.
   - If Santa is on the party circuit, he can add some Tuppertoys
to his pack. New this season are Picture Plates and Shapes `N Words
stencil kits. These help young artists come up with different
shapes and textures by stenciling or rubbing with crayons, paints
or markers.
   - In a similar vein is Magna Doodle from Tyco Toys, with a
spiral-making frame, two spiral design wheels, a color doodle sheet
with characters and designs, two-sided tracing sheets and magnet
shapes.
   - A fanciful arched door (which looks a little like the one at
10 Downing Street) makes up the Kids' Play Place from Today's Kids.
The roof point is approximately 42 inches and can be set in any
doorway, closet or corner, between furniture, indoors or out. It
has sculptured clapboard siding, a Dutch door, see-through windows,
ringing doorbell, mail slot, doorknob and key.There's an outside
planter, milk box and garden faucet.
   - The Mother Goose Musical Projector from Kidstar is a
combination cassette player and projector in the form of a castle
keep surmounted by three-dimensional characters of Old King Cole,
Red Riding Hood, and Humpty Dumpty. A cassette will play an hour of
lullabies while fairy tale figures are projected onto the ceiling.
   - The youngster with building ambitions can start with Stanley
plastic tool sets with their own tool boxes or workbenches, from
Playtime. There also are realistic-looking power saws and drills,
complete with changeable bits.
   - The Ghost Writer from Ohio Art is the company's way of
celebrating the 30th anniversary of its Etch A Sketch. This new
version has two sides to draw on, and both sides disappear when the
board is shaken. A two-tipped magnetic stylus is attached with a
cord, so it can't get lost.
   - Future postmasters can get into practice with Fisher-Price's
Post Office, a set that includes a mailbox, post office boxes with
clicking keys, a stamp dispenser and letter carrier tote. Letters
can be written on wipe-off stationery, put into play envelopes and
mailed with a snap-on stamp. If the kids prefer the phone, they can
keep in touch with the Record &amp; Playback Telephone, which lets them
record and play back messages. The phone also has a coin slot and
push-button keypad.
   - An updated classic is the Mighty Tonka Power Treads truck,
with rolling tread and a working earth-moving blade. Working sirens
and firefighters have been added to Tonka's new fire trucks.
   - Even bigger wheels come from Power Wheels, which features a
Suzuki ``Quad Racer'' in its battery-powered ride-on vehicles.
   - And for settling down for a nice read, there's Playskool's
Holiday Squeaker Books for toddlers, which feature bright graphics
and squeaky noises to tell ``A Holly Jolly Story'' and ``A Very
Merry Christmas.''
   - The Read &amp; Do Storybooks from Better Homes &amp; Gardens tell
stories starring Max the Dragon and other characters.
   - Music for tots is a hot new category, according to the Early
Learning Centre, and it's marketing 50 selections from 15
children's recording artists, including the ``You Are You''
singalong cassette by Kevin Roth. ELC also has Beatrix Potter
characters like Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin, Jemima Puddleduck
and Jeremy Fisher featured in books, dolls, puzzles, and other
novelties.

   TRAINING WHEELS. Nostalgia on the track.
   - The favorite toy of many a long-gone youth was the model
train. Lionel is featuring nostalgia in its 90th year by
reintroducing the Scale Hudson locomotive, which it first marketed
in l937. It also has introduced its 90th Anniversary train set,
which has a GP-9 diesel engine, RailSounds system, operating
headlights, illuminated cab and number plates, and five boxcars
that recall important moments in the line's history.
   - For its own piece of history, a model of the BL2 diesel, made
by Life-Like Products, pulled six passenger cars without stopping
for more than 36 days straight last summer to break the record for
continuous running by a model train and give itself berth in the
``Guinness Book of Records.'' The diesel, modeled after the l950s
Western Maryland vintage engine, is featured in the Proto 2000
Series for serious hobbyists. The company also has sets for other
levels of hobbyists, including its Burlington Bullet and Little Joe
lines.
   - Nostalgia can be combined with high tech with train sets from
Marklin that can be operated either through a personal computer or
through a central control unit of the set. Trains, signals,
switches and other accessories are run digitally.
   - If you're a really older child - say above 25 - you can take
your train on the train in an attache case. Marklin has what it
calls the world's smallest train in a briefcase with a Z-gauge
layout, track, buildings, scenery and controls. Three freight cars
and a locomotive are powered by battery or transformer.
   - Perhaps the train enthusiast will be intrigued by a 1903 model
Renard Road Train, among the antique and collectible toys from
England listed in the Mint &amp; Boxed catalog at 32,000 pounds
sterling, or about $63,000. Less pricey versions of trains, cars,
trucks, boats and other miniatures - including the Matchbox, Corgi
and Dinky lines - are available at M&amp;B's new gallery in New York.
   BRAINFOOD.
   - Tiny scholars learning their numbers and the alphabet get help
from the latest model of the See 'N Say talking toy from Mattel.
This version of the 25-year-old toy has a new pull-lever that
replaces the string mechanism of earlier toys. Jim Henson's Muppets
and Mickey Mouse characters are new features, with Kermit Counts,
to help preschoolers learn to count to ten, and Mickey's ABCs, to
help them learn the alphabet.
   - The Super Speak &amp; Math from Texas Instruments is a talking
calculator in a brightly colored case designed to appeal to
children learning numbers.
   - Children can get into things scientific with Capsela, the
motorized science discovery system from Sanyei. They can learn
principles of mechanics and physics through a series of toys that
feature moving gears housed in clear capsules. The sets have
interlocking, interchangeable parts that can be assembled to create
all kinds of geared or motorized gadgets, include a vacuum cleaner,
a submarine, a hydrojet or racing car. One set, the Capsela 2000
Computer Control System, enables the youngster to build robots
which have a range of over 200 feet. The set has a computer memory
that can store up to 94 commands and operates 17 functions, all
powered by batteries.
   - Geographic literacy is the aim of GeoSafari from Educational
Insights. This electronic quiz game can be used with a variety of
GeoPacks of maps and facts to help youngsters learn about geography
around the world. One new pack, ``Make Your Own,'' lets users make
up a map quiz of their local town, school or state.
   WHATCHITS. From the jocular or innovative giver.
   - What are those strange hairy-looking things? They're Koosh
Kins from OddzOn Products, and they're a family of rubbery
personalities with porcupine hairdos, animated faces and moveable
arms that can grab onto things - maybe even this newspaper.
Theoretically, they are for children, but an adult may not refuse a
gift of Boingo, T.K., Slats, GeeGee, Scopes or Grinby.
   - Speaking of rubbery things, what about a nice big bowl of Guk?
Another almost indescribable product, this potion is something you
get in and grub with. It's mixed with water, feels rubbery or hard
in turn, messes up your fingernails and may even be fun. It's from
Chieftain Products.
   - The Z Ball has bounced its way up from Down Under into the
U.S. market. This Aussie invention, from Fundex, defies the usual
logic of balls, having six sides and protruberances that cause it
to pop, bounce, leap and richochet in unpredictable ways. The
company says it's being used by sports enthusiasts to sharpen
eye-hand coordination; the California Angels and the Boston Red Sox
used the ball during spring training last season.

   Children 100 years ago used to occupy themselves making paper
decorations for the holidays. Snowflakes. Lanterns. And families
would create Advent wreaths and calendars together. They might have
had a taffy pull to amuse themselves during long winter evenings.
   Dear Reader, families have it within their power to resurrect
these wholesome and homely pastimes. Mrs. Sharp will tell them how.
   ``Children learning how to amuse themselves is practically a
lost art,'' says Sarah Ban Breathnach, author of ``Mrs. Sharp's
Traditions'' (Simon &amp; Schuster), a compendium of Victorian customs,
ceremonies and amusements for seasons and holidays the year round.
   ``A modern child, if there's nothing on television, or he
doesn't have a ready-made toy, is bored,'' says Ban Breathnach
(pronounced Bon Brannock). In contrast, the Victorian child could
turn to inspiration and instructions for simple crafts from
children's or women's magazinss, such as Godey's Lady's Book,
Demarest's Family Magazine, The Mother's Magazine, or the
Illustrated London News (many of these were published on both sides
of the Atlantic). ``The crafts gave them a sense of the family
working together.''
   Ban Breathnach says the Victorians practically invented the
``traditional'' Christmas. Before the middle of the 19th century,
the holiday was observed but not celebrated, a legacy of the
Puritan era. By mid-century, though, Dutch and German immigrant
families arrived, bringing their customs for merrymaking and
celebrating with them. And across the ocean, Queen Victoria married
Prince Albert, who introduced the Christmas tree and other German
traditions to England and America.
   The reasons behind their yearning for ceremony and custom were
surprisingly similar to those for present-day revivals.
   ``There was a great upheaval in the lifestyle of the Victorians.
They were moving from the farms to the cities. The railroad had
changed their lives by letting them move more freely around the
country. Along with this, the woman's role as an educator and home
manager became magnified. She was responding to what she thought
home life should be,'' says Ban Breathnach.
   They often felt threatened by new things; there even were
sermons preaching against the corrupting influence of ice cream
parlors.
   ``They turned to traditions to give them a sense of control over
their lives.''
   So today, with violence on the street and on television, and a
recession possible, people feel the same way, she says. ``There's
the sense that things are out of control again.''
   She became interested in the period when she found some of the
old magazines while browsing in an antique shop. ``I got
transported back to the Victorian era when life seemed so ordered,
so serene and blissful - so completely unlike my own life,'' she
writes in the foreword to the new book. ``Like fifty million other
working women juggling the demands of work and raising a family,
all I knew about home life was that when push came to shove, what
got shoved out of my life was the very thing I valued most: quality
family time.''
   So she created the mythical Mrs. Sharp, a Mrs. Beeton-like
authority on family tradition. Ban Breathnach did a radio series on
the subject for National Public Radio and ran workshops about
Victorian holiday and seasonal pastimes. Later, she started a
column for the Washington Post Writers Group.
   Though the character is fictional, the name is real. She is
married to Edward F. Sharp, a Washington lawyer and city council
member in Takoma Park, Md.
   Now dear readers can find how to cut snowflakes for their trees
or holiday tables (instructions below). They can learn about
Stir-Up Sunday, when preparations for holiday goodies, including
the Christmas pudding, begin. They can read about Victorian
Sugarplum Trees, or Santa Lucia's Day, or the entire Christmas
holiday cycle culminating in Twelfth Night celebrations. They can
try recipes and crafts, included in the text.
   Ban Breathnach also has a few words of advice to single parents.
   ``Sometimes single parents feel left out of it. But it's
important to carry on the traditions to help establish an
equilibrium for the children.''
   And she urges Jewish parents to invite their children's
Christian friends to share Hanukkah traditions and not feel
pressured to turn the holiday into a ``Jewish Christmas.'' She
recalls her own daughter was fascinated by the menorah when invited
by a Jewish schoolmate to share a family festival of lights
observance.
   But whatever they do, families should celebrate together, she
says. ``The Victorians did these things all year round. It gave
them a sense of continuity, of being in rhythm.''
   --
   VICTORIAN PAPER SNOWFLAKES
   
   Based on instructions from ``Mrs. Sharp's Traditions'' (Simon &amp;
Schuster):
   Have an older child or adult first cut a hexagonal template from
cardboard (one for each child).
   Then let the children trace all the basic snowflakes they want
from white tissue paper.
   To cut the ``lace,'' fold each tissue hexagon across its center,
then into thirds, so it forms a six-ply triangle. Any design (as
long as it doesn't cut the corners that hold the snowflake
together) can be traced and then nipped with scissors into the
folded sides.
   Open it up and mount on colored paper, or string a dozen or so
together on thread to hang from branches, or lay across a table.

   It was in the year 165 B.C. that Judah Macabee and his followers
defeated three Syrian generals and recaptured and rededicated the
temple at Jerusalem.
   Jews around the world still celebrate the event, Hanukkah, an
eight-day holiday which this year begins the night of Dec. 11.
   Hanukkah, the festival of lights, is one of the few holidays
that unites Israeli Jews, divided at other times along religious
and secular lines.
   Secular Jews observe it as a celebration of the victory by the
small band of Jewish rebels over their mighty Syrian rulers as a
symbol for modern-day Zionism.
   
   Religious Jews emphasize an ancient miracle said to have
occurred at the temple after it was liberated, when an eternal
flame burned for eight days on oil that should have lasted one day.
   
   Whatever their level of observance, almost all Israeli Jews at
some time light the menorah, the holy lamp that recalls the story
of Judah and his followers.
   
   Jewish tradition holds that when the rebels were purifying the
temple of pagan rituals performed by the Syrians, they found enough
oil for only one day to relight an eternal flame. But miraculously,
the flame burned eight days until more oil arrived.
   While the traditional menorah is described in the Bible as
having seven candlesticks, a special candlelabrum with nine
candlesticks - the hanykkiyah -is used only to celebrate Hanukkah.
   
   For the eight days of Hanukkah, Jews celebrate by lighting an
additional candle each night on the candlelabrum. A ninth candle in
the middle, known as the ``shamash'' or servant in Hebrew, is used
to light the other eight.
   In the United States, Hanukkah is often marked by giving lavish
gifts. But Hanukkah presents are rarely exchanged in Israel.
Children receive small sums of money, known as Hanukkah ``gelt'' in
Yiddish, or the traditional four-sided spinning top called a
``dreidel.''
   Many believe that Hanukkah gift-giving became popular in the
United States because of the holiday's proximity to Christmas.

   And visions of computer games, expensive doll
houses, and noisy wheels dance in their wee little heads...
   Most American children today live in isolation from the
workplace or the farm and have no idea of the labor needed to earn
money for expensive toys, says a Catholic University of America
psychology professor.
   ``It is difficult for young children to understand why their
parents won't buy them the bike they want when they see that
parents have money,'' says Hans Furth, a developmental psychologist
who has researched children's ideas about the marketplace.
   Furth says that children can't be expected to learn the value of
money until they are at least teen-agers. Young children aren't
curious about how things get their value, and they aren't ready to
learn.
   So what about the holidays?
   ``It depends on how children relate to their parents. If
children respect their parents and see their parents handling money
sensibly, the children will probably do the same.''
   Peer pressure to get ``in'' toys is a big problem, Furth
observes. ``Our children live in a world of commercialism, and we
have to help them learn to live with it.''
   But don't try to make junior financial wizards out of children.
``Children should be free to be children and to dream and
fantasize, especially at Christmas,'' he says.

   A holiday dessert that's traditional but still different to
American palates is the kransekage from Denmark.
   This rich but light sweet is simple and quick to make and is put
together in a way that will let you use your creativity. Stack the
rings to make a Christmas tree, lay them out into a cornucopia, or
whatever your imagination suggests. The Danes adapt it for many
special occasions, often serving it with brandy.
   This recipe comes from from Conditori La Glace in Copenhagen,
one of Denmark's best-known coffee and cake houses. Proprietor
Marianne Stagetorn and her chief confectioner, Ebbe Jepsen, offer
it - along with dozens of layer cakes and confections, many named
after royalty or famous people - at the shop which has been at the
same Skoubogade 3 address in Copenhagen for 120 years. (Another
shop opened last year on Kongens Nytorv, also in the heart of the
city.) It's not anything like the heavy, sticky-bun Danish pastries
found in American coffee shops.
   
   KRANSEKAGE
   
   2 pounds, 3 ounces marzipan
   2{ cups sugar
   2/3 cup egg whites
   white icing
   
   Blend marzipan and sugar well, then add egg whites. Mix well.
Form into 14 rings in ascending cigar-shaped sizes. The largest
ring should measure approximately 8 inches in diameter and the
smallest, 2 inches in diameter. Bake 7 minutes in a 475-degree
oven.
   Decorate with white icing, piping thin swirls onto each ring.
Use icing to secure the rings, stacking them into an inverted cone
shape. Trim with colored decorations mounted on picks (La Glace
shows it with small paper Danish flags). This will make 25
servings.

   Food is one one of the oldest gift traditions at holiday time.
   Working people may not always have time to make things from
scratch, but they still can add a personal touch by selecting items
to go into a gift basket. ``People are more interested in giving
and receiving food items that are light and healthy,'' says Harriet
Joynes, whose company, The Ultimate Basket, makes baskets and
hampers for holiday giving.
   Choose a theme when making up a basket, she suggests. A ``High
Tea'' hamper might feature scones, jam, imported teas and holiday
napkins. Or a ``Holiday Brunch'' theme might suggest French bread,
goat cheese, fresh fruit and pastries. Choose a basket that will
have a secondary use, too. A woven basket might become a towel or
magazine holder. Or instead of a basket, put the edibles in an
outsized salad bowl, ice bucket, or even a wire gardening basket.
   A local gourmet or specialty food store is a good place to find
delicacies for a hamper. And you might include non-food items aimed
at favorite pastimes of the recipient, like a mystery novel or
magazine, golf or tennis balls, or a T-shirt.
   Wrap the whole concoction with swatches of colorful fabrics like
calicoes or gingham, covered with clear plastic and topped with
ribbon. --
   Of course, there are some people who think chocolate is the only
true food gift.
   Chocophiles can savor Ethel M Chocolate gifts done up in
baskets, tins, mugs, compotes, or planters and with toys, like
plush Teddy bears and pups dressed for Christmas or Hanukkah. Gift
sets are available at the company's shops in Arizona, California
and Nevada or by mail (shipped express). Call 1 (800) 6-ETHEL-M for
a catalog or to place an order. --
   The Complete Chocoholic First Aid Kit from The Chocolate Gallery
comes with bite-sized chocolate bandages, ``quick fix'' chocolate
tablets, a box of chocolate ``aspirins'' and a large chocolate
``diet pill.'' The company also markets a financial aid kit, with
chocolate charge cards and bills, and chocolate floppy disks,
called MacSnacks or PC Snacks. All gifts can be personalized. For a
catalog, call 1 (800) 426-4796. --
   Impossible to mail ice cream? Not with the ingenuity of
Haagen-Dazs, which is offering a gift box of embossed gold
certificates, each good for a pint of ice cream. Gift boxes can be
bought in Haagen-Dazs Shops or by phone: 1 (800) 336-PINT. --
   The Pennsylvania General Store has Dutch samplers with such
items as funnel cake mix, corn relish, homemade ketchup, shoo fly

   Plan ahead for a quaff to celebrate the arrival of the
millennium in 2000. Aberlour Distillery Company of Scotland has set
aside a limited number of hogsheads of single malt Scotch whisky
for U.S. and Canadian buyers for 1999 delivery. Cost is about
$2,700 for the hogshead, or the 30-case yield of the traditional
aging cask. That works out to about $12 per bottle of the Scotch
which may cost nearly $50 by 2000, according to Douglas Callander,
Aberlour's export director. The Millenium offer is the first time
any alcoholic beverage except Bordeaux wine has been offered as a
future, he says. While waiting for the whisky to mature, hogshead
buyers will be kept informed of progress through a newsletter and
invited to visit the distillery in Aberlour to personally inspect
the hogsheads. Distiller Ian Mitchell says that ``We want to make
sure than a fortunate few on the other side of the Atlantic are
assured of having enough for all their toasting at Hogmanay - New
Year's Eve - and for some years thereafter.'' For details, call
(212) 725-9144. --
   A box of Irish whiskeys in twelve handblown Waterford crystal
decanters with sterling silver neckers is being offered for about

engraved with any greeting or message. Details from the Irish
Whiskey Importers Association, (212) 490-0300.

   Werner Erhard of San Francisco sent out 62,824 Christmas cards
in 1975, believed to be the greatest number ever sent by an
individual.
   This is the kind of cheering information for the season that can
be discovered by people who find the 1991 edition of ``The Guinness
Book of Records'' (Facts on File) under their trees. (Note: the
tallest cut Christmas tree was the 221-foot-high Douglas fir put up
at the Northgate Shopping Center in Seattle in 1950.)
   The Guinness has a record of its own: It has sold 61 million
copies in 31 languages, second only to the Bible. This new
Americanized version has U.S. records listed along with world
records, including baseball stats. --
   It's been almost 500 years since Columbus sailed into what he
thought was the Far East. Two in the first batch of anniversary
books are Rand McNally's ``Atlas of Columbus and The Great
Discoveries'' by Kenneth Nebenzahl and ``America 1492: Portrait of
a Continent 500 Years Ago,'' by Manuel Lucena Salmoral (Facts on
File).
   Nebenzahl, a map historian, traces the cartographic history of
the Columbus expedition, noting that misrepresentations of the
ocean's breadth on the Ptolemaic, mappaemundi (world maps) and
portolan sea charts of that era were behind the discoverer's belief
that he could sail westward to the East. The book is illustrated
with many of these early maps, including a portolan sea chart
attributed to Columbus himself.
   The book continues with the story of how mapmakers in the
ensuing years dealt with the change in their concepts of world
geography, and how Europe colonized the New World.
   Salmoral's book focuses on the Americans that Columbus
mistakenly called Indians. Histories of such tribes as the Inuits
in the North to the Mays, Aztecs and Incas of the South are
extrapolated back to pre-Columbian times, drawing on eyewitness
accounts of contemporary Spanish historians and a few surviving
native documents. --
   Out to prove that vegetarian fare is mainstream cuisine, food
writer Baba S. Khalsa spent a year interviewing - and eating
vegetables with - America's most noted chefs and food writers. The
result is ``Great Vegetables from the Great Chefs'' (Chronicle
Books).
   Khalsa blends his interviews with such personalities as Julia
Child, Alice Waters, Jasper White and Ferdinand Metz with anecdotes
and recipes, describing how they view the role of vegetables in the
meals they create. Recipes include meatless meals like risotto with
asparagus and brandy, wild mushroom pasta, grilled eggplant and
pesto pizza. Holiday and regional cuisine get special attention,
too. --
   Reproduction editions of the originals by F. Scott Fitzgerald,
William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and other
American literary giants - complete with the original dust jacket
artwork - have been published by First Edition Library.
   The jackets are those that the authors negotiated and fretted
about. F. Scott Fitzgerald liked the cover art for ``The Great
Gatsby'' so much that he wrote to his editor: ``For Christ's sake,
don't give anyone that jacket. I've written it into the book.'' And
John Steinbeck, in an effort to confront accusations that ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' was alien propaganda, insisted that the lyrics to
``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' (from which his title was
taken) be printed on the endpapers. The Gatsby cover for the new
series was reproduced from the only known original, in the author's
scrapbook now at the Firestone Library in Princeton.
   The new editions - many of them reprinted for the first time
since their original popularity - are printed on acid-free paper
and slipcased.

   Crafters who knit, crochet, and sew have transformed a neonatal
intensive care unit in Akron, Ohio, from a sterile atmosphere into
a rainbow world of babies wearing tiny stocking caps and bootees in
colors that celebrate the holidays, seasons, and life itself.
   According to Christmas Ideas, a Better Homes and Gardens
publication, this volunteer project at Children's Hospital Medical
Center started nine years ago and now provides much-needed garments
each month for 100-150 premature babies, some of whom have major
health problems.
   Volunteering to knit or crochet tiny caps and bootees or sew
small kimono-style gowns for premature infants in children's
hospitals across the country is a Christmas craft project that can
be extended year-round. Children's hospitals welcome all of these
garments, says Susan Bales, public relations person for the
National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related
Institutions.
   Even in a hospital's controlled environment, the tiny babies
still need caps and bootees for warmth. Their bodies, however, are
too small for newborn-size clothes (some of the infants weigh less
than 1 pound).
   At the Children's Hospital of Akron, nurses used cut-off tube
socks to cover the infant's heads before volunteers started
providing garments that fit, says Marilyn McGuckin, director of
volunteers. ``We now have a core of volunteers who regularly make
tam hats, caps topped with big pom-poms, and others knitted in
bright seasonal, holiday, and school colors.''
   Volunteers also are needed to make small mittens to keep some
infants from pulling out stitches. In addition, doll-size kimono
gowns can be sewn from soft, fire-retardant flannel materials for
the babies.
   ``The babies in our neonatal intensive care unit start out so
small, but after they progress through several stages, gain weight,
and become healthier, then they go home wearing colorful caps and
bootees,'' McGuckin says.
   ``The caps-and-bootees program is one of many examples of what
volunteers in a community can do to support their children's
hospital,'' says William H. Considine, president of Children's
Hospital Medical center of Akron. ``It requires just a small
investment of time and money, but it means so much to the families
of these infants. The caps and bootees provide these families with
a special keepsake of their baby's first days in this world. The
program also provides a human touch of kindness at a critical time
for parents and their newborn child.''
   Instructions and patterns for six projects are given in the 1990
issue of Christmas Ideas magazine.

   Thousands of dolls, stuffed animals, toy trucks and cars - not
bought in stores but handmade by Boeing Company employees and
retirees - will reach disadvantaged children in communities across
the country again this year.
   Members of the Boeing group, working through the company's
employee outreach program, make the toys on their own time during
evenings and weekends. Materials, including wooden wheels, axles
and scrap wood, are donated by the company. One Seattle retiree
alone has produced 1,000 wooden cars in his home workshop this
year.
   The project was started in l984 by employees who asked that
funds usually spent on a company Christmas party be used on
community service projects instead. Last year the group made 28,000
items.

   Christmas is in the air. And in San Antonio, New York, New
Orleans, and probably in your home town, too.
   Some notable public tree or light displays:
   The Christmas tree and Neapolitan Baroque creche display at New
York's Metropolitan Museum of Art rivals the Rockefeller Center
tree as the favorite of New Yorkers and visitors.
   This 20-foot blue spruce is decorated with Renaissance cherubs
and angels, with the Spanish choir screen in the museum's medieval
sculpture hall as backdrop. Its base is surrounded with 18th
century creche figures depicting the Nativity (set in the ruins of
a Roman temple), angels and shepherds and their flocks, the three
Magi and their retinue of Orientals and Moors, and crowds of
merchants, burghers and peasants. These figures recall the custom
of Nativity scenes developed in Italy, southern Germany and the
Tyrol. The figures were collected and presented to the museum by
the late Loretta Hines Howard, and the museum's display has been
repeated for 27 years since.
   New Orleans lights up with thousands of twinkling lights along
the Moonwalk, Woldenberg Riverfront Park and Spanish Plaza.
Riverfront streetcars, decorated with garlands, red bows and white
lights, take passengers to see fireworks displays. Santa Claus
starts the show after his arrival in his Merry Tug on the
Mississippi River, followed by a parade of brightly lit tugboats,
the Steamboat Natchez and the Paddlewheeler Creole Queen.
   San Antonio's lights center on its River Walk, with over 50,000
lights trimming the trees and footbridges. Thousands of Mexican
luminarias (candles in paper bags) line the River Walk, a symbol of
lighting the way for the Holy Family. Santa appears here by river
barge at the Holiday River Parade.
   In Hawaii, Santa arrives by canoe (he must by now be a qualified
sailor) to the various islands. In Honolulu, the Festival of
Christmas Trees at Honolulu Hale (city hall) is the heart of the
city's celebrations. The festivities include Christmas hulas, with
little girls wearing tinsel leis.
   Reno normally has plenty of lights flashing, but the casino
lights go dark when 40 blue spruce trees along the city's main
thoroughfare light up for the Festival of Trees. The trees will be
trimmed by area charities in competition for the most beautiful,
original and best themed decorations. The ceremony is preceded by a
four-block caroling procession that leads from the Pioneer Center
for the Performing Arts to the ``Biggest Little City in the World''
arch downtown.
   Christmases of the past will be re-created in the historic
buildings at the Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich. Cotswold
Cottage, for example, will show how a rural English Christmas was
celebrated, while an American Victorian Christmas will take place
at Firestone Farm. Nearby, at the Henry Ford Museum, a giant
Christmas tree decorated with toys, candy and cookies will almost
touch the roof. In the museum's concourse, a fantasy Lionel train
layout - including a car with a tiny camera that broadcasts an
``engineer's eye view'' - will make its way through a gingerbread
village. And visitors can contribute pictures of their own family
holiday traditions for use on the holiday photo wall, later to
become part of the museum archives.

   Traditional family holiday house and tree decorations have
always seemed to be a mix of favorite baubles kept from one year to
the next and new homemade ornaments, often made by the children.
   Kids can make sculptured ornaments with glue dough, using cookie
or canape cutters or dull knives to cut out holidays shapes like
stars, bells, Santas, and so on.
   The clay recipe calls for \ cup each of flour, cornstarch and
Elmer's Glue-All. Roll out the dough on a floured board to a &lsqb;-inch
thickness, then cut the shapes, adding a hole in each (use a piece
of plastic straw, leaving it in for an hour or so). Allow the
ornaments to dry for 12 to 14 hours, turning them occasionally.
Then color them with a glue paint made from the glue and food
coloring or cake decorating gels. Apply right from the glue bottle,
or use toothpicks. Beads, glitter, ribbons and other trims can be
pressed directly onto fresh glue paint. Once the paint is dry,
details can be added with a fine-tipped marker. --
   In this media age, nostalgia may be an old advertising campaign,
and if you're over 50, you may remember one of the most common
images of Santa Claus was the one in the Coca-Cola ads. With that
in mind, Communicorp of Atlanta has created ornaments based on Coke
Christmas art originally painted by Swedish artist Haddon Sundblom
during the l930s and 1940s. The ornaments, in three-dimensional
interpretations or tins with lithographed reproductions, include
Santa swigging Coke and the bottle cap sprite. --
   The modern decorating urge extends to the T-shirt and other
wearables. Washing the item first and inserting a piece of
cardboard for firmness under the spot you plan to use for your
masterpiece, create wearable holiday art or greetings with Tulip
paints. Special effects can be achieved with the puffy, suede,
slick or iridescent versions of the Tulip line. --
   Dizzle also makes fabric paints and transfer art as well, should
you feel less than competent at drawing. Transfers are shaded and
colored and can be combined with regular and glitter paints for
maximum effect. The company also offers bright opaque paints that
work on denims and other dark fabrics. --
   And decorate the air, too. Sylvania has come up with light bulbs
that spread the aroma of potpourri in a variety of fragrances. Heat
from a 25-watt Light Scent bulb activates scented tablets placed in
an indentation in the top of the bulb. Tablets last the average
life of the bulb - 1000 hours.

   Fight back. At the candy, the gravy, the
booze.
   Here's an example of sheer heresy from Kay Stanfill, associate
professor of dietetics at the University of Oklahoma Health
Sciences Center:
   ``Don't put out a dish of candy this year.''
   Stanfill says that while Americans are improving, they still
feel the urge to indulge at holiday time. There's always a lot of
food around, along with the pressure to have a bite - or more. And
as if the temptation isn't bad enough, there also is more alcohol
at hand. ``The more you drink alcoholic beverages, the more the
willpower is significantly decreased,'' she says.
   Dig in, she advises, but not at the table.
   If you're invited to a party, plan your early day calories
around it, eating lightly at breakfast and lunch. Then, at the
party, eat slowly, just sip your drink, and talk a lot - all of
which will reduce your intake. ``You can visit the buffet table and
take a moderate portion of the dip and vegetables that are usually
there and fill yourself up. But don't just stand at the table and
`graze.' Go sit down somewhere with a specific amount, so if you go
back to the table, it's an action you have to be aware of.''
   She advises both guest and host to take alcohol seriously. If
you're the host, serve food - protein and carbohydrates - along
with the drinks. Make punch with a non-carbonated base like fruit
juice, since carbonation makes the body absorb alcohol faster.
Serve non-alcoholic beverages, too. Have jiggers or self-measuring
one-ounce bottle spouts at the bar if guests mix their own. Don't
force drinks on your guests or refill their glasses without being
asked. And stop serving alcohol two hours before the party is over.
   On the other hand, don't try too hard to control yourself during
the holidays, she says, because it's bound to fail. ``It's better
to plan to eat those things that really matter to you, that really
represent the holiday, and skip the things that aren't as
important.''

   Be tough on toys before your kids are, advises a new safety
poster, ``Play It Safe,'' being offered free by the Association of
Trial Lawyers of America and the Johns Hopkins Injury Prevention
Center.
   Some of the advice: Check out buttons, bells, squeakers and
rattles to be sure they're strong enough to resist coming apart in
the inquisitive hands of a child. Avoid toys that have sharp edges
and points. Skip anything that involves darts, lawn darts,
projectiles, air rifles or guns. Take down crib gyms when baby is

   Advice for avoiding holiday fire and theft hazard from Dynamark,
the security system franchisor:
   Never use real candles on live trees, since trees dry out
quickly in heated houses. Menorah candles should never be left
unattended while burning. If you choose an artificial tree, keep in
mind that plastic ones should have a fire-retardant label from
Underwriters Laboratories or a similar testing agency. Metal trees
require extra care if used with electrical decorations, since
frayed insulation, loose connections or broken sockets can result
in deadly shock. Make sure that the lights you use outdoors are
designed for external use, and never put them up while standing in
water or snow.
   If you're away for the holiday, leave a radio on, tuned to a
talk show. Turn down the ringer on your phone so constant ringing
won't alert a potential burglar that you're not home. Make sure
that cartons for expensive holiday gifts are hauled away before you
leave. Leave a car parked in the driveway, and arrange to have the
driveway shoveled if it snows during your absence. Cancel
newspaper, milk and mail deliveries. Have some indoor lights and
radios connected to timers. Ask your local police to periodically
check your home. --
   Advice for rescuing clothes and furnishings from holidays stains
and spills from Maytag:
   Alcohol or wine should be sponged up promptly with cold water,
or the article soaked in cold water for 30 minutes. Launder using
chlorine or oxygen bleach, as appropriate to the fabric. Candle wax
should be chilled with an ice cube, then carefully scraped off with
a spoon or dull knife. If traces remain, put the fabric between
several layers of facial tissue or paper towels and press with a
warm iron. Work on stains with safe cleaning fluids. Otherwise,
launder in the hottest water possible for the fabric. If the spill
is chocolate, cocoa, meat, gravy, milk or ice cream, soak in cold
water. Pretreat any remaining stain and launder using the hottest
water possible for the fabric. For a cranberry sauce stain, blot up
excess liquid, then make a solution of a teaspoon of mild
detergent, a teaspoon of white vinegar and a quart of tepid water.
Sponge, and if any stain remains, rub detergent into the stain
while it's still wet. Launder in warm water. --
   Here are some catalogs to help you pick environmentally safe
gifts:
   The Ecco Bella catalog lists personal care, household, pet and
food products. For a copy call 1 (800) 888-5320.
   ``The Ecologue'' (Prentice Hall) by Bruce Anderson advises on
choices for home, yard and personal products as well as supplies
for recycling. The book also carries a list of environmental
organizations.
   The Real Goods Trading Company offers home, recreation,
electronics and other products. Call 1 (800) 762-7325 for a
catalog. --
   Save an acre of tropical rainforest in someone's name as a
holiday gift. The Nature Conservancy's Adopt-an-Acre Program offers
an honorary land deed for at least one acre and semi-annual reports
on conservation activities for $30. Information and credit card
orders can be handled by calling 1 (800) 628-6860. --
   A unique gift that doesn't require batteries and never needs
walking is suggested by Earthtrust, non-profit environmental
organization this Christmas: adopt a whale.
   Adopting a whale is tax deductible and costs $35, says Michael
Bailey, the organization's program director. ``That's less than a
penny per pound.''
   ``Whale parents'' receive an official certificate of adoption
and the Earthtrust quarterly newsletter which includes updates on
the organization's environmental activities and ways to get more
involved in saving the planet.

   The government's gauge of future economic
health dropped 0.8 percent in September, the second straight big
decline and the third month without improvement, the Commerce
Department said.
   Many analysts responded to the Friday report by saying a
national recession not only had arrived but was intensifying.
   The Bush administration contends the economy is growing and will
continue to do so at least into the new year, but the question for
many private analysts instead is how long and severe the
contraction will be.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - America's unemployment rate held at 5.7
percent in October after rising for three straight months, but big
new job losses still cut across the U.S. economy, the government
said.
   For the third month in a row, more industries lost jobs than
gained them, the Labor Department said Friday in a report analysts
took as new evidence a recession is taking hold.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Resolution Trust Corp. announced it is
putting up for sale 18 failed savings institutions, including
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, considered to be the
costliest collapsed thrift ever.
   The failure of Lincoln, formerly owned by Charles Keating Jr.,
is costing taxpayers an estimated $2 billion. Keating faces
numerous civil and criminal charges.
   The RTC, the federal agency responsible for disposing of
hundreds of failed S&amp;Ls, said Friday it is accepting bids from
potential buyers for the 18 institutions.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Pan Am Corp. said its third-quarter losses
increased by 62 percent, reflecting sharply higher fuel costs
brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The ailing airline reported Friday it lost $29.1 million, or 19
cents per share, for the quarter, compared with a loss a year
earlier of $18 million, or 12 cents a share.

   DETROIT (AP) - The shaky economy caused Chrysler Corp. and Fiat
SpA to call off months of talks about possible joint ventures or
other business arrangements, the No. 3 U.S. automaker and the
Italian company said.
   ``Uncertainties in the global economy, rising oil prices brought
on by the crisis in the Gulf, the slowdown in sales in both the
U.S. and European automotive markets and the overall deterioration
in worldwide business conditions created overwhelming obstacles,''
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said Friday.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Fast-food giant McDonald Corp.'s decision to
abandon foam packages won't put much of a dent in the plastics
industry, but it symbolizes America's growing discomfort with the
throw-away image and could prompt other businesses to shun the
material.
   The containers for Big Macs, Quarter Pounders and other
sandwiches served at McDonald's 8,000 restaurants nationwide
account for less than 1 percent of the $5 billion-plus market for
polystyrene, says the Society of the Plastics Industry, a
Washington trade group.
   The immediate impact will be felt by McDonald's suppliers.

   PARIS (AP) - The bottlers of bubbly Perrier water reported that
net profits more than doubled in the first half of 1990 despite a
worldwide recall after dangerous chemicals turned up in some
samples.
   The profit increase came mostly from the sale of the group's
soft-drink operations, Source Perrier SA said Friday.
   First-half volume sales of the popular mineral water were down
14 percent from 1989 and revenue slipped 3 percent due to the
recall and delays in restocking the beverage, Source Perrier said.

   Ball Corp.'s failure to obtain financing for
a $1.025 billion acquisition of a European can producer illustrates
how important, or fatal, timing can be to expansion plans.
   A year ago, experts say, the Muncie-based manufacturer of
containers and aerospace systems would have had no problem finding
$625 million in cash to pay Peter Kiewet Sons' Inc. for the
European operations of Continental Can Co.
   Kiewet, of Omaha, Neb., also would have received $400 million in
Ball stock.
   However, in the three months since the tentative deal was
announced, world financial markets have been thrown into turmoil
amid the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The prospect of a recession has loomed larger, the magnitude of
the savings-and-loan crisis has become more clear and banks have
felt the pinch of regulatory oversight.
   ``It's all coming to the front here simultaneously,'' said
Robert C. Klemkosky, a financial market expert at the Indiana
University School of Business. ``In 1989 (this deal) would have
gone. It would have been a slam dunk.''
   Wall Street agrees.
   ``I think it has less to do with Ball than it has to do with the
credit markets today,'' said Robert Bishop, a stock analyst with
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   ``It's more difficult to get financing today than it was back in
July. You're in a situation where you have a big S&amp;L bailout going
on. We're starting to find out more about all the loans that were
made throughout the '80s,'' Bishop said.
   He added: ``The Gulf certainly didn't help matters any.''
   Ball announced the acquisition plans on July 30, three days
before Iraq invaded Kuwait. At the time, Ball stock was trading
around $32 per share and the Dow Jones industrial average was
threatening to break 3,000. Today, Ball trades closer to $26,
reflecting the stock market's loss of about 16 percent during the
three months of the U.S.-led military buildup in the Gulf.
   Ball and Kiewet announced Oct. 26 their deal was off.
   ``Unfortunately, due in major part to the recent turmoil in
world financial markets, and in particular the U.S. banking
community, Ball has not yet arranged financing, and the certainty
of closing the transaction on the agreed upon terms and time frame
have become compromised,'' they said in a joint statement.
   Ball officials have declined to comment further on the
circumstances that led to the deal's failure.
   They stood to gain much from acquiring Continental Can-Europe.
Ball already was established as one of the top five producers of
beer and soft drink cans in the United States but lacked a major
presence in one of the world's fastest growing markets: Europe.
Ball has only a plastics plant in Northern Ireland and an
electronics operation in Germany.
   Continental Can, Europe's No. 3 container producer, appeared to
provide the opportunity Ball long had sought but never attained.
Ball has abandoned European joint ventures that never proved as
profitable as hoped, and it failed two years ago to acquire
MetalBox Ltd., a Continental Can competitor eventually bought by a
French suitor.
   Packaging revenues would have tripled. Continental Can had sales
of $1.47 billion last year and projected them to reach $1.66
billion in 1990. Ball container sales last year were only about
half of that, $781 million.
   Ball, which likes to keep its debt-to-equity ratio around 40
percent, was prepared to temporarily sacrifice that conservative
position: Financing would have raised the ratio to 60 percent,
qualifying the deal as a highly leveraged transaction.
   Such deals attract closer scrutiny, and that no doubt scared
some lenders.
   ``The market's going to look very skeptically at that,''
Klemkosky said. ``The banks are self-imposing capital rationing.
Banks are just being extremely careful who they're lending to.''
   H. Edward Schollmeyer, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.,
speculated Ball may have been forced eventually to walk away from
financing that came at too high a price in interest and bank fees,
no matter how badly it wanted Continental Can.
   ``They spent a lot of money working on it, and I think there's a
lot of broken hearts,'' Schollmeyer said.

   What does an oil trader do when the industry
says the nation's supply of crude is falling by about a million
barrels and the government says it's rising by about a million?
   When this happened last week, futures players on the New York
Mercantile Exchange used the bullish numbers from the industry to
push prices higher. They paid less attention to the government
numbers, even though some in the industry believe the government
usually comes closer to the mark.
   Others have their doubts as they analyze weekly petroleum
reports that are generally released Tuesday evenings by the leading
industry group, the American Petroleum Institute, and Wednesday
evenings by the independent statistical branch of the Department of
Energy.
   ``A lot of people feel the DOE numbers are more correct, but at
the same time you have to remember they have that government
influence on them,'' said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst
with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. ``Are they
receiving better information, or are they simply trying to paint a
better picture? A lot of people figure if they have a chance to
paint a better picture, they will.''
   The government disputes the contention that its numbers are
anything but the most accurate it can compile, and many industry
observers doubt the DOE numbers are manipulated for political
reasons.
   Analyst Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. sees such
a charge as the type of cynicism that leads some people to believe
anything negative they might hear about the government.
   ``These numbers are so open for inspection that it would be
pretty hard to bugger them,'' Baker said.
   Nonetheless, during the Persian Gulf crisis that has now entered
its fourth month, the discrepancies that have shown up between the
two statistical reports have tended to show higher stockpiles for
crude and gasoline in the federal reports.
   In last week's reports, the API showed gasoline stocks falling
by 2.2 million barrels and crude oil stocks falling by 900,000
barrels. DOE showed gasoline stocks rising by 1.4 million barrels
and crude stocks rising by 1.2 million barrels.
   Those swings were larger than usual, analysts said, although
Baker points out they were smaller than the gap that showed up a
few years back when a difference of 8 million barrels of crude
raised questions about the ways the government and the industry try
to keep track of oil.
   Baker said he puts more faith in the government numbers, saying
that months after the fact, when the statisticians release modified
reports that are supposed to be more accurate, the API generally
adjusts its figures in the direction of the DOE numbers.
   He also pointed out that the API report contains a ``fudge
factor,'' showing a discrepancy in all the barrels of oil and
refined petroleum products that didn't quite add up from week to
week. Last week, it was 405,000 barrels.
   ``On imports, sometimes they don't get a tanker counted when it
lands,'' Baker said. API statistician Edward Murphy acknowledges
it's easier to keep track of refineries than tankers, so sometimes
the giant ships are left out and oil imports can be the trickiest
number to estimate.
   Still, oil traders are more likely to respond to the API
numbers, which those in the industry refer to simply as ``APIs.''
The API report has been around longer. It comes out first, giving
it a definite edge in potential to move a market that often jumps
at the latest shred of information floating in.
   API waits until the Mercantile Exchange closes each Tuesday
before it even compiles the numbers. Once they are compiled, they
are released immediately, so no one ever has access to any
unreleased information, Murphy said.
   The API numbers are the ``industry's bellwether,'' according to
senior oil analyst Ann-Louise Hittle at Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc.
   Despite that, ``the general perception is if you had to, you'd
probably put the DOE's as being more accurate,'' she said.
   Statisticians from API and the Energy Information
Administration, which compiled the government numbers, agreed it's
hard to say why they sometimes chart crude stocks moving in
different directions. But both groups say their numbers are
generally quite close, with most discrepancies being statistically
insignificant.

<HEAD>Redwoods `Angel' Hit by Timber Industry Smear Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Harold L. Arbit, who bought
timber stocks for clients despite his fondness for forests, laughed
at the first rumor attacking him for bankrolling a ballot measure
to protect California's redwoods.
   He was trying to make a killing by cornering the ``redwood
futures market,'' claimed opponents of the voter initiative in
timber country.
   That rumor died quickly after folks found out there are no such
things as redwood futures.
   But the campaign against Arbit didn't stop and he isn't laughing
now.
   ``The timber industry is fighting this issue with slander and
lies,'' said Arbit, president of Concord Capital Management, a firm
that manages a $2.08 billion stock-market portfolio for pension
funds, universities and foundations.
   He spoke at a recent interview in Concord Capital's offices,
overlooking brush-covered hills and eucalyptus trees in San Mateo.
   ``I've had people tell me they would have supported the
initiative financially, but they don't want to take the same kind
of abuse and heat that I've taken,'' Arbit said. ``It doesn't mean
enough to them to do that. They don't want to jeopardize their
privacy and business reputation. The message that's gotten across
is that (the timber industry) is going to do whatever it has to do
to make life difficult for anyone who challenges them.''
   Arbit has spent $5.1 million, a record for an individual in
California, to support the ``Forests Forever'' proposition on the
ballot Tuesday. His contribution, along with $1 million from Walt
Disney Productions executive Frank Wells and his wife, has provided
the bulk of the $6.5 million funding for Prop. 130.
   Opponents of Prop. 130 have raised $9.6 million, most of it from
timber companies.
   ``I guess if someone gives to a museum so he can put his name on
it, or creates a wing in a hospital, that's something people can
relate to,'' said Arbit, who calls the $5.1 million ``a large
chunk'' of his wealth. ``But if you contribute to an initiative or
an environmental cause, somehow that's viewed as being different.
I'm not quite sure why.''
   He'd given several million to other environmental efforts in the
past, sometimes anonymously, but he didn't go into this campaign
thinking he'd spend so much.
   At first, when he asked attorneys last year to draft the
initiative with a coalition of environmental groups, he figured
he'd lay out about $1.5 million. But the ante grew as the timber
industry mounted its response.
   ``My banker keeps saying, `Are you sure you want to do this? Are
you sure it's worth it?' And I keep asking myself what material
possession would I rather have, versus knowing that I've helped
save a unique natural heritage,'' Arbit said.
   His decision always came down on the side of the redwoods.
   Arbit, 43, said he's been fascinated by the giant trees since
his childhood in California.
   ``I remember reading (Rachel Carson's) `Silent Spring' in high
school,'' he said. ``It made me aware that people could have an
impact on nature.''
   Nonetheless, Arbit still invested $154 million of his clients'
funds in eight logging and forest-products companies last year,
along with aluminum and chemical companies, as part of a strategy
to buy cyclical stocks.
   ``My personal beliefs are separate from the hat I wear as a
fiduciary,'' said Arbit, whose clients include the Rockefeller
Foundation, Ford Motor Co. and the state of Connecticut.
   That separation of beliefs and responsibilities opened Arbit to
early suspicion by other environmentalists and repeated criticism
from Prop. 130 opponents.
   If clear-cutting of forests in California is restricted, that
could drive up lumber prices in other states and benefit some of
the companies in which Arbit invested, according to one argument.
   The problem with that, according to timber industry analyst Mike
Shea of Black &amp; Co. in Portland, Ore., is that the companies Arbit
invested in, such as Louisiana-Pacific Corp., probably would have
their gains outside California offset by losses in California.
   ``On balance, it might be a wash,'' Shea said. ``I don't
understand what (Arbit) is doing. He's a large shareholder of
(Louisiana-Pacific) and there are aspects of the initiative that
are brutal to the (timber) companies. If the initiative passes,
it's certainly not going to make him any money.''
   Some timber companies, such as Pacific Lumber, a unit of Maxxam
Inc. of Los Angeles, might profit from the sale of bonds to buy
their redwood forests. But Arbit's portfolio doesn't include
Maxxam, Pacific Lumber bonds or any other bonds. He invests
strictly in stocks.
   Whether the timber companies gain or profit from Prop. 130,
Arbit's clients won't feel much impact. The eight lumber and paper
stocks represent a small portion of the nearly 200 stocks in
Concord Capital's portfolio.
   No one who has attacked Arbit over the past year, including
lawmakers and a spokesman for the timber industry campaign against
Prop. 130, has come up with evidence that his motives are anything
but altruistic.
   Rep. Doug Bosco of Sebastopol, where many voters depend on the
timber industry, said in July he was sure Arbit was trying to
manipulate the stock or bond markets. Bosco now admits Arbit ``may
be perfectly innocent.''
   Dave Fogarty, a public relations spokesman for the timber
industry, calls Arbit's donation ``obscene,'' challenges his
motives and says the industry has ``done a little research'' on
Arbit. Fogarty says, however, that he can't prove Arbit would
profit from Prop. 130, and adds ``our job is to raise the question
and move on.''

<HEAD>Gas Prices Slip For First Time Since Persian Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices at the pump declined over the
last two weeks for the first time since the Persian Gulf crisis, a
new survey says.
   The national average price for all grades of gasoline fell 0.18
cent to $1.4691 per gallon, according to the Nov. 2 Lundberg Survey
of 13,500 stations.
   ``Although the retail price did not change much on average, gas
prices were volatile across the country this week,'' analyst Trilby
Lundberg said Sunday. ``Prices generally rose on the East and West
coast while falling on the Gulf Coast and in the Midwest and Rocky
Mountain region.''
   Since July 20, the last survey before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, prices rose an average of 29.20 cents, said Lundberg.
   An estimated 4.3 million barrels of oil a day were lost because
of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the resultant embargo of Iraq. The
Energy Department said increased production shrunk that deficit to
1.1 million barrels a day in October.
   Lundberg said a lower demand for gas after the summertime
driving season contributed to lower prices.
   However, she added that ``crude oil prices have risen more than
gasoline prices.'' These costs have not yet been passed by stations
to the consumer and that may check any downward trend in prices,
she said.
   The average price for gas at self-service stations was $1.3610
per gallon for regular unleaded, $1.5242 for premium unleaded, and
$1.3264 for regular leaded.
   The average price for gas at full-service stations was $1.5777
per gallon for regular unleaded, $1.7134 for premium unleaded and
$1.5408 for regular unleaded.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Holding Company More Time to Turn Around Truck Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has given
Olympia Holding Corp. another month to turn around its financially
troubled PIE International trucking subsidiary.
   Over strong objections from the company's largest secured
creditor, Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation, U.S. District Court
Judge George Proctor said Sunday the truck line could continue to
use money from its accounts receivable to operate until the next
court hearing, set for Dec. 15.
   Proctor also ruled PIE could resume making payments to the
Teamsters union's health and welfare and pension funds. Last week,
the union's leadership threatened to strike on Monday if the fringe
benefits were not funded.
   Olympia filed last month for protection from its creditors while
it reorganized under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. It
listed debts of $237 million supported by assets of $169 million as
of Aug. 25.
   PIE owes Fidelcor nearly $40 million. The loans are backed by
certain equipment and accounts receivable, which are what PIE
customers owe for services already rendered.
   Attorneys for the New York-based lender argued that PIE's
survival is not viable and that it is continuing to erode an asset
- more than $60 million in accounts receivable - pledged to
creditors.
   ``The debtor has no money. The debtor has no assets,'' said
George Ridge, a Jacksonville attorney representing Fidelcor. ``The
only way it can succeed is on the back of one creditor -
Fidelcor.''
   ``It was shocking that Fidelcor wanted to close the company
down,'' countered Steve Busey, an attorney representing PIE.
   ``We are pleased the court overruled Fidelcor's objections,
permitted PIE to continue to operate, and ruled that it has a
reasonable prospect for a successful reorganization.''
   At Sunday's hearing, Proctor also said PIE can resume paying
freight discount payments to customers, something the company said
it needed to do to retain its customer base.
   Meanwhile, Olympia Holding has signed a letter of intent with
EnviroSource Inc. and its subsidiary IU International Corp. to form
a new transportation company.
   In part, the new corporation would include PIE; IU
International's 72 percent interest in Landstar System Inc., a
company that owns five truc lines, including Ranger and Poole; and
Itofka Consolidators Inc., a company that sells piggyback railroad
service to trucking companies, court documents show.
   IU International, based in Stamford, Conn., had owned PIE, but
sold it in 1985. Owed more than $20 million by PIE, IU
International now is the second largest secured creditor.

<HEAD>Satellite TV Merger Likely to Face Regulatory Hurdle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed merger of Britain's two rival
satellite television networks is likely to be reviewed by the
government's Office of Fair Tradig, a spokesman said today.
   The office is obliged to look at any merger which would give one
company more than 25 percent of the market and a spokesman said it
is likely to look at the proposed combination of the Sky Television
and British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. services.
   The spokesman was not identified in accordance with government
practice.
   Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television announced late Friday that its
four-channel service and British Satellite Broadcasting's five
channels would merge to form a new five-channel network called
British Sky Broadcasting.
   Murdoch's News International PLC, which owns Sky, and BSB's
major shareholders will each own 50 percent of the new company, Sky
said. They will be merging a combined investment of 1.25 billion
pounds, or about $2.5 billion.
   BSB is owned by an international consortium including the TV and
leisure conglomerate Granada Group PLC; publishing companies Reed
International PLC and Pearson PLC, which publishes the Financial
Times; and French conglomerate Chargeurs SA.
   Sky, which was launched in February 1989, and BSB, which has
been operating for six months, have been hit by soaring costs,
dwindling advertising revenues and falling British TV audiences.
   Britons watch an estimated average of 25{ hours of television a
week, down 10 percent from five years ago.
   News International revealed recently that Sky has been losing 2
million pounds, or $3.9 million, a week but Murdoch said it would
go into profit next year.
   Until the launch of Sky, British television consisted of four
land-based channels - British Broadcasting Corp.'s BBC1 and BBC2
which are funded by an annual fee paid by TV viewers, and
Independent Television and Channel 4, both funded by advertising.
   According to Continental Research, a media research company, the
number of British homes receiving satellite television direct
exceeded one million for the first time at the end of August.
   Another 600,000 British homes receive satellite television by
cable.
   Sky says there are just over 1 million of its circular receiving
dishes in use in Britain's 22 million homes. There are an estimated
100,000 of BSB's distinctive square dishes, dubbed ``squarials,''
in use.
   Sky's four networks were Sky Movies, available by subscription;
Sky One, the entertainment channel; Sky News, providing round the
clock bulletins and current affairs, and Eurosport, offering sport
action from around the world.
   BSB's Movie Channel competed with Sky on subscription. The
Galaxy channel provides light entertainment and the Now channel is
the network's lifestyle channel. BSB's other two channels are
devoted to sports and rock and pop music.

   A Japanese car maker said Monday it is providing
technical assistance in a venture with China.
   Suzuki Motor Co., Japan's top minicar maker, plans to assist in
production starting Tuesday in China on a version of its Alto
model, a five-door hatchback, said Suzuki spokesman Masafumi
Yayoshi.
   Negotiations for the production at the China Changan Machine
Building Plant have been underway for the past two years, Yayoshi
said.
   The Chinese plant now manufactures Suzuki's Carry model, a
lightweight commercial vehicle, with technical assistance from
Japan, he said.
   China has been producing cars under joint ventures with foreign
firms, including Volkswagen and Peugeot.
   Through technical assistance agreements, Daihatsu Motor Co.
produces three car models in China, whose total production was
18,398 last year, according to a company spokesman.
   Toyota Motor Co. will begin offering technological assistance to
China on car exteriors starting late next year, said company
spokesman Toshiyuki Hirooka.

   British Telecommunication PLC and MCI
Communications Corp. have agreed to build a $400 million
transatlantic fiber optic cable to relieve a telecommunication
capacity shortage, MCI said today.
   The two companies are inviting other international
telecommunications carriers to participate in the planning,
construction and operation of the new high-capacity cable, expected
to be the largest undersea telecommunication line ever constructed.
   The companies will share the cost of construction according to
their percentage of ownership, MCI spokesman David Thompson said.
   ``This is the first time that MCI initiated the planning of a
transatlantic cable that will be built, operated and owned by a
consortium of common carriers,'' MCI President Bert C. Roberts Jr.
said in a written statement.
   ``It is a step toward providing an integrated network of
mutually supportive cables across the North Atlantic,'' he said.
   MCI said it would handle the equivalent of 150,000 simultaneous
phone calls. The first transatlantic cable, completed in 1956,
could handle only 60 simultaneous calls, Thompson said.
   The cable, currently called TAT-X, is scheduled to go into
service in 1993. It will be the seventh such cable in operation
after the construction of TAT-9 is completed in 1991, Thompson
said.
   The companies plan to use the line with synchronous optical
transmission equipment, which is designed to allow centralized
control of circuits, maintenance testing and cable restoration.
   TAT-X also will provide service for other cables in case of
service interruptions.

   Less than a week after announcing it would buy the

announced today the deal was off.
   General Cinema, which already owns a little more than half of
the 33.2 million shares of outstanding common stock in Neiman
Marcus, said it would not begin its $14.40 per share offer for the
remainder.
   General Cinema said it took the action because a special
committee of the Neiman Marcus board of directors had decided to
withdraw its recommendation of the tender offer.
   General Cinema announced the deal last Tuesday, saying it had a
large available pool of cash for buying the stock.
   Analysts said although the retail industry is sluggish, Neiman
Marcus represented a good long-term investment for General Cinema.
   Aside from its stake in Neiman Marcus common stock, General
Cinema also holds an issue of convertible preferred stock in the
specialty retailer which, if converted, would increase General
Cinema's total interest to about 60 percent.
   General Cinema owns 16.8 million shares of common stock in

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a lack of
significant developments to move the markets.
   Soybeans were mostly lower while the corn and soybean markets
were very narrowly mixed.
   Analysts said wheat drew slight support from indications the
Philippines was seeking to buy more than 600,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat. The Agriculture Department announced this morning that
the Philippines bought 92,000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized
prices.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the
grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
harvest-related selling kept pressure on the corn and soybean
markets although the harvest is nearly done.
   The USDA's weekly harvest update was scheduled for release today
after the close. On Thursday, the government will release a monthly
crop report containing revised estimates of 1990 U.S. corn and
soybean production.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to { cent lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.64} a bushel; corn
was \ cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.30\ a bushel;
oats were \ cent lower across the board with December at $1.21} a

at $5.90{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Most pork belly contracts rose
the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound, reflecting stronger
cash markets.
   Live cattle futures were .15 cent to .28 cent higher with
December at 77.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.30 cent higher with November at 87.47 cents a pound; live hogs
were .05 cent to .45 cent higher with December at 52.80 cents a

February at 66.20 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Fridays; pork futures rose.

<HEAD>Eagle-Picher Says Settlement Possible Within 30 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eagle-Picher Inc. said Monday it hopes to
settle thousands of asbestos disease lawsuits and future claims
within 30 days.
   The automobile parts and industrial machinery maker said if a
settlement is reached by Dec. 2, a federal judge in New York then
could order more than 60,000 pending claims consolidated into a
single class-action lawsuit.
   The move would be a breakthrough in resolving tens of thousands
of lawsuits nationwide against former makers of products containing
asbestos, a widely used insulation material that can cause lung
cancer and other respiratory ailments.
   Eagle-Picher and other companies have been trying to get federal
judges to consolidate thousands of liability lawsuits and order
mass settlements in an effort to limit the damages they have to
pay.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who is overseeing the
asbestos litigation, issued an order Saturday barring Eagle-Picker
from making payments on personal injury or wrongful death claims,
except in hardship cases, until Dec. 2.
   ``The company is pleased that a settlement appears to be
imminent,'' Eagle-Picher Chairman Thomas E. Petry said in a
statement.
   Petry said that if Weinstein approves a class action, the judge
then would hold a hearing to address the settlement.
   Eagle-Picher made an asbestos-containing pipe insulation
compound used on Navy ships. Eagle-Picher had $20 million in sales
of the product from 1934 until the company stopped making it in
1971.
   Eagle-Picher has paid more than $500 million in settlements and
lawyers' fees for asbestos disease cases. About 64,000 of 130,000
claims filed against Eagle-Picher are outstanding, company
spokesman J. Rodman Nall said.
   In September, a court report said Eagle-Picher has been
financially devastated by liability for asbestos disease claims and
faced insolvency by the end of 1992.

   Scott Paper Co. announced Monday it has

Europ`There is little doubt in our
minds that the company needs a lot of money and it needs a lot of
money fast. We are simply saying that they are coming to the wrong
people to get that kind of money.''
   ``These employees can't afford a 35 percent wage cut,'' Dahl
said. ``They (UPI officials) have come to us for concessions
probably seven times in the last decade and there is no more left
to give.''
   He said officers of the union were sticking to their
recommendation that the contract be rejected, but would submit it
to the full membership because they believe ``this is a very, very
serious situation that every member should have the opportunity to
have their own say on.''
   UPI announced Friday that it has cut management salaries by 35
percent for 90 days and would seek similar concessions from
employees represented by the guild as it seeks a buyer for the news
service.
   UPI has changed ownership three times in the past eight years.
The news service announced in September that it would close bureaus
in five states and said Oct. 12 it was dismissing an unspecified
number of employees.
   Vanbennekom, in a message to employees transmitted over the
company's wires, said, ``UPI in its last few decades never had a
real chance at taking its rightful place among the successful
giants of the growing information industry. It is up to us now to
make sure we get a real chance.''
   He cautioned, however, that approval of the pay cut would not
``guarantee UPI will be successfully sold.''
   ``The only thing it guarantees is that we will be able to take
the process to its conclusion, giving us vital breathing room to
find the best possible home for UPI,'' he said.
   Vanbennekom said last Friday that several offers had been made
for the news service, which is owned by Infotechnology Inc.

<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Co., Japan's No. 2 automaker, on
Monday reported a 16.5 percent increase in net income and record
domestic sales in the first half of fiscal 1990.
   But Atsushi Muramatsu, a Nissan executive vice president, said
the company may face falling consumer demand, higher costs and
funding constrictions in the second half. He said the Tokyo stockmmarket's
plunge and the uncertainties of Gulf crisis may prompt
households to reconsider spending plans.
   For the six months ended Sept. 30, net income was 46.84 billion
yen, or $367.8 million, a 16.5 percent increase from the same
period a year earlier, Nissan reported.
   It said brisk consumer demand for new models kept sales growing
for the seventh consecutive fiscal half.
   Unconsolidated sales rose 7 percent from a year earlier to 2.05
trillion yen, or $16.1 billion.
   Worldwide, the parent company sold 1.18 million vehicles, up 0.2
percent. Nissan sold a record 717,915 vehicles on the domestic
market, up 8.4 percent from a year earlier, but its share of the
domestic market fell to 23.6 percent from 24.2 percent in the first
half of fiscal 1989.
   Domestic sales totaled 1.09 trillion yen, or $8.6 billion, up
13.0 percent.
   The company sold 462,979 vehicles abroad in the half, down 10.4
percent from a year earlier, while proceeds from the sales grew 1.3
percent to 599.13 billion yen, or $4.7 billion.
   Overseas production fell 3.8 percent to 308,713 vehicles.
Muramatsu attributed the decline to model changes at factories in
the United States and Britain, and said production was expected to
increase in the second half.
   But he warned that a recession in the United States could lead
to lower auto sales.
   Nissan forecast unconsolidated sales of 4.1 trillion yen, or
$32.2 billion, for the full year, up 2.4 percent from fiscal 1989.
It projected net income of 90 billion yen, or $706.7 million, up
5.4 percent.

<HEAD>Aid to Countries Hit By Gulf Crisis Reaches $13 Billion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Special aid to countries hit hardest by the Persian
Gulf crisis has reached nearly $13 billion, a new coordinating
committee announced Monday.
   Since the United Nations embargo was imposed against Iraq for
invading Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Gulf states have pledged $8.4
billion in assistance for countries hurt financially by observing
the embargo, said the Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination Group.
   The 12-nation European Community has promised another $2.2
billion, Japan pledged $2 billion and other countries committed
$300,000, the group said.
   About 80 percent of the aid will go to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan,
the group said. Another $2.5 billion will be sent to other
countries, including Syria, Morocco, Djibouti and Lebanon,
according to the group.
   ``We're very, very satisfied with these commitments, which are
very sizeable,'' said David Mulford, the U.S. undersecretary of the
Treasury.
   The Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination Group was proposed by
U.S. President George Bush in September. The group determines which
countries need aid most, and works to assemble and disburse the
money quickly.
   The United States was not listed as a donor because ``the U.S.
is forgiving almost $7 billion of Egyptian military debt, and also
has 250,000 troops on the front line,'' Mulford said.
   He said the group's figures are the first substantive accounting
of the aid to nations affected by the U.N. embargo.
   Before the group reached the conclusions presented Monday, he
said, it was believed that $10 billion to $11 billion had been
promised to countries hurt by their compliance with the embargo.
   However, a Western diplomat said many of the earlier ``numbers
were political numbers that didn't have a recipient attached,'' and
were simply estimates of aid that might be given.
   ``As of today, these numbers are the commitments - and that's
important for Mr. Saddam Hussein to see,'' Mulford said.
   He said that more than one-third of the money had already been
disbursed in the form of low-cost loans, grants, and contributions
of oil and other goods. The $13 billion in aid comes in addition to
countries' contributions to the multinational military force and
previously established bilateral assistance.
   More than 25 nations sent delegations to Monday's meeting, the
group's third, representing countries in Western Europe and the
Middle East as well as Japan, the United States, Canada, Australia
and New Zealand.
   Representatives of the European Community, the Gulf Cooperation
Council, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank also
attended.

<TEXT>
   The Netherlands' largest insurance
company and its third-largest bank announced Monday they plan to
merge, forming a financial giant with combined assets worth $156
billion.
   The Nationale Nederlanden insurance firm and NMB Postbank said
in a joint statement that the merger would be in line with both
companies' target of expanding in Europe and at home.
   The new company, whose name hasn't been determined, would be
able to offer a wider range of financial services than either do
separately and would combine their distribution networks in the
Netherlands, according to the announcement.
   The move follows several earlier mergers in the Dutch financial
world, including the Oct. 4, 1989, combination of the Nederlandse
Middenstandsbank and Postbank, the privatized banking arm of the
Dutch PTT.
   Under the latest proposed merger, a new holding company would
issue shares in exchange for existing NMB Postbank and Nationale
Nederlanden stock, the annoucement said. The offer would not be
available in the United States.
   Further details will be worked out in the next few weeks,
including an agreement with the powerful Dutch labor unions, the
announcement said.
   ``Although cost efficiencies are possible in the long term ...
the merger would not give rise to either short-term savings or
short-term costs,'' the anouncement said.
   It did not say whether any jobs would be lost. The two companies
employ approximately 16,000 people outside the Netherlands.
   Nationale Nederlanden, which employs 25,000 people, earned $579
million on sales of $13.6 billion in its latest fiscal year.
   NMB Postbank, which employs 23,000 people, earned $391 million
on sales of $3.15 billion in its latest fiscal year.

observers say, the Federal Reserve is getting more and more leeway
to relax its credit policy.
   Wall Streeters hope cheaper money will alleviate the credit
problems that have been unsettling the banking industry and the
real estate market.
   The depressed bank stocks, which began an upswing late last
week, posted further gains today. Manufacturers Hanover rose ~ to
18{; BankAmerica 1 to 21&rsqb;; J.P. Morgan { to 39{, and Chase
Manhattan &lsqb; to 10}.
   Among other prominent financial issues, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage gained ~ to 37&lsqb; and Federal National Mortgage was up { at

   Falling oil prices provided another plus for the market. Crude
oil for December delivery dropped about $1.50 a barrel, to $32.50 a
barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed .38 to 170.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .56 at 290.54.

<HEAD>Seek Another Airfare Increases Because of Persian Gulf Standoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading airline industry group on Monday
recommended up to an 8 percent increase in passenger fares and 7
percent rise in cargo prices to help airlines offset high fuel
costs caused by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The International Air Transport Association's recommendations,
issued during its conference in Geneva, marked the second time
since the crisis began three months ago that the airline industry
has moved to raise prices because of fuel inflation. Any increase
is subject to approval by affected countries.
   The airlines want the increases to take effect by mid-December,
but association officials said some governments might not address
the question until after the Christmas holidays.
   Airline industry profits have been battered by slowing economies
in the United States and elsewhere. The rising cost of jet fuel
since Iraq seized Kuwait three months ago has made matters worse
for many carriers, who must buy enormous quantities of fuel at
prices that fluctuate daily.
   The association said in a statement the increase in prices to
customers are ``to recover, at least partially, continued cost
increases, particularly in fuel prices.''
   In August, airlines in the association said they would initially
boost international passenger fares by 8 percent.
   Unlike fares in the United States, which have been deregulated
since 1978, most international fares are determined by agreement
among airlines and national governments.
   Industry officials say the previous fare increase, which
generally took effect this month, failed to cover higher costs
caused by the jump in oil prices. Seesawing crude-oil prices in
recent weeks have added to the financial strain.
   The International Air Transport Association is the industry's
leading group, with about 200 member airlines.

<HEAD>Help Wanted Index Drops As Employment Demand Shrinks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Demand for labor continued to decline in
September as the economy weakened, according to a survey released
Monday by the Conference Board.
   The business research organization said its Help Wanted Index,
which tallies the volume of employment advertising in 51 major
newspapers, fell to 122 from 127 in August.
   A year earlier, the index stood at 146.
   The Conference Board said advertising volume rose in only two of
nine reagions of the country - the Mountain region, which includes
Denver, Phoenix and Salt Lake City; and the West South Central
region, which includes Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, New Orleans,
Oklahoma City and Tulsa.
   The Labor Department reported the nation lost 52,000 jobs in
September and 70,000 in October - which means the October Help
Wanted Index is likely to show yet another drop. The unemployment
rate fell to 5.7 percent in September and remained at that level in
October.
   Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board, said the
economy ``much too soft to generate enough job growth to keep
unemployment from climbing.''

   The stock market gained g Brennan, his predecessor as

in Washington.
   That outcome could carry a message for Republican governors
waiting out returns in the Middle West after campaigns in which
they had to deal with tax increases and budget problems.
   Competition for open House seats, in which no incumbent is
running, could offer clues to the congressional trend. There are 29
open contests nationally, 18 in districts held by Democrats now, 11
by Republicans.
   Party turnovers in the open contests can be clues to the

<HEAD>Soybeans Sag to 3-Month Low Amid Export, Harvest Bearishness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices sagged to new three-month
lows Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as hopes for new sales of
soybean meal to the Soviet Union faded. Corn finished slightly
higher, wheat slightly lower.
   The soybean market was further pressured by expectations that
Thurday's Agriculture Department crop report will contain a
significant increase in the estimated 1990 U.S. soybean harvest,
said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research Department
Inc., a brokers' advisory service.
   Karlin said he expects the USDA to raise its soybean production
estimate to 1.85 billion bushels from last month's estimate of 1.82
billion, and some analysts believe the number may be as high as 1.9
billion.
   Karlin said the sharp midday decline featured heavy selling yy
speculative funds that had bought soybean contracts last week in
anticipation of a U.S. offer of export credits to the Soviet Union
to enable the Soviets to buy soybean meal.
   But no such announcement came last week. On Monday, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter indicated President Bush had not changed
his position of withholding export credits to the Soviets until
Moscow loosens up its emigration policies.
   Soybeans for delivery in November fell as low as $5.80 a bushel
during the session, the lowest price for near-term soybeans since
Aug. 3.
   At the close, soybean futures were 3{ cents to 12 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in November at $5.81 a bushel; wheat
was } cent to 1\ cents lower with December at $2.64{ a bushel; corn
was { cent to 1} cents higher with December at $2.30} a bushel;
oats were } cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $1.21 a

<HEAD>Once-Freewheeling Developer Holds Household Liquidation Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former freewheeling developer Kenneth Good
has resorted to what many Americans do when short on cash - a
garage sale.
   All day Sunday, Good opened his home to deals on household items
ranging from a zebra-skin rugs to plastic tissue dispensers.
``Kenneth Good Estate Liquidation Sale Today - art, furniture, TVs,
stereos, kitchenware, bedroom sets, and more!'' read signs at the
entrances to the ,,000-acre Tampa Palms development he built in the
mid-1980s.
   Good, who greeted bargain-hunters to the home he once tried to
sell for $650,000, said he was moving but told a reporter he did
not want to talk to the press.
   ``We're just getting rid of some stuff,'' said a young man who
identified himself as Good's son.
   Good is known for his business links to Neil Bush, the
president's son, who was a director at the Silverado Savings and
Loan Association in the 1980s. Bush is under government scrutiny
for failing to inform fellow directors of his ties to Good and
another developer who eventually defaulted on $132 million in
loans.
   Silverado's collapse in 1988 cost taxpayers $1 billion.
   Good's empire began to crumble last fall. In April, after he
missed payment on more than $200 million in debt, lenders seized
control of his Gulfstream Holding Co. and its properties, including
Tampa Palms.
   Recently, Barnett Bank took over Good's Tampa Palms house in a
foreclosure auction.
   Some of Sunday's shoppers apparently found a few steals. One
woman left cradling a jumbo box of pots and pans. Another man
hauled a silver object d'art to his silver Mercedes.
   Others found the unmarked items too pricey.
   ``Everything's expensive,'' said Gerry Cameron of Tampa Palms.
   Good, a former Dallas developer, narrowly escaped bankruptcy in
the 1970s. He moved to Denver in time to ride the wave of the oil
boom and quickly entered the top social and political circles.
   He moved to Tampa in 1985 after buying Tampa Palms. He later
bought the Gulfstream Land and Development Corp. of Florida and
gained control of more than 30,000 acres in Florida and Georgia.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction to their lowest level in more
than two years.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.8 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.07 percent, down from 7.12 percent
last week. Another $9.8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.05 percent, down from 7.13 percent last

   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.05
percent on Aug. 15, 1988, and six-month bills averaged 6.99 percent
on July 11, 1988.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors

   A former stockbroker on Monday settled charges
that he illegally traded on information in advance copies of
Business Week magazine.
   John L. Petit, an ex-broker with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. in Newport Beach, Calif., was the 11th person charged by the
Securities and Exchange Commission with illicit trading involving
the weekly business magazine.
   Petit, who now lives in Boca Raton, Fla., agreed to pay $195,528
in illegal profits, fines and interest to settle the charges. He
was barred permanently from the securities industry.
   The SEC said Petit did not admit or deny guilt, but agreed to
cooperate in the commission's continuing investigation.
   The charges, filed in Manhattan's federal court at the same time
his settlement was announced, said Petit obtained advance copies of
Business Week from a client who was a salesman for the magazine's
printer, R.R. Donnelly and Sons Co. Inc. in Torrance, Calif.
   Petit allegedly used the inside information to buy securities of
at least 42 companies for his own account between September 1986
and July 1988.
   The SEC additionally accused him of sharing the information with
a customer and a business partner who also traded in securities of
companies mentioned in pre-release issues of the magazine.
   The SEC said the salesman gave Petit advance copies of the
magazine in return for a discount on brokerage commissions and
later for cash payments.
   Their transactions took place in Smith Barney's parking lot and
a parking lot of a McDonald's restaurant, the complaint said.
   The salesman, Shayne Walters, settled similar charges with the
SEC and is awaiting sentencing on a related criminal charge.
   Petit's payment to the SEC included $66,555 in profits he made
from the illegal trades; $11,836 in brokerage commissions he earned
as a result of his customers' trading activities; $23,288 in
interest; and $93,847 in penalties.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Big Three automakers' sales of North
American-made cars and light trucks rose 5.3 percent in late
October and were up 2.7 percent for the first month of the 1991
model year, the companies said Monday.
   The upturn countered other portents of a slowing economy,
incral of which are expected to testify.
   Lawyers promised to raise new issues about sexual consent and
mental illness during the trial of Mark A. Peterson, 29, of
Oshkosh.
   ``There are a lot of people who are just plain skeptical about
this thing,'' District Attorney Joseph Paulus told reporters during
a court recess. ``The bottom line will be if (the jury) believes it
(the disorder) or not.''
   Under Wisconsin law, sexual contact is forbidden with those
suffering from a mental illness or deficiency so severe they can't
understand the consequences of their behavior.
   Prosecutors allege Peterson had sex with one of 27-year-old
woman's personalities last June after learning she was mentally
ill.
   Peterson's lawyer, Edward Salzsieder, said he will show Peterson
didn't know the woman was mentally ill and thought he had proper
consent. The attorney said he also would try to convince the jury
that the woman doesn't suffer from a mental illness and has put on
``a big show.''
   The woman was expected to take the stand under the influence of
six or seven of her personalities, which psychiatrists have
documented.
   Circuit Judge Robert Hawley ruled the jury will be sequestered
during the trial, which was expected to last three days.
   The charge against Peterson carries a maximum prison term of 10
years.
   The woman changed personalities on the witness stand during a
preliminary hearing earlier this year. She blinked her eyes and
paused each time she was asked by lawyers to switch identities.
   The judge required during the hearing that each of her
personalities take an oath before testifying.
   A psychiatrist who has treated the woman for four years said he
diagnosed last February that she suffered from multiple personality
disorder.
   The disorder is triggered by emotional or physical abuse during
childhood, forcing victims to create separate personalities to
avoid confronting reality. It affects about 7,000 people in the
United States, psychiatrists said.
   The woman, a college graduate, testified at the preliminary
hearing that she told Peterson she was a woman of many
personalities.
   One of her personalities is that of a male body-builder.

   Time Warner Inc. has agreed to buy the 50
percent interest of In Health magazine and related businesses it
does not already own from an investment group for an undisclosed
price, it was announced Monday.
   In Health magazine covers consumer health topics and appears
every other month with a rate base that will increase in March to
800,000 from 650,000.
   The magazine, published from Sausalito, Calif., was launched in
April 1987 as Hippocrates magazine. Time Warner bought a 50 percent
interest in late 1988.
   The owners spun off a magazine for physicians only in early 1989
and called it Hippocrates while using the name In Health for the
remaining consumer magazine.
   Hippocrates, which is included in the latest deal, is sent to
120,000 doctors.
   Time Warne has interests in a number of regional or special
interest publications, including Southern Living, Cooking Light and
Parenting.

<TEXT>
   Oil prices fell more than $2 a barrel Monday,
reflecting what traders called the growing realization that global
demand has declined and supplies remain adequate despite the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Oil trading strategists noted that the market has now gone more
than a week without any wild trading based on war jitters or
speculation that peace could be near. They said the market may have
settled into a phase of trading based more on the fundamentals of
supply and demand.
   ``A lot of people are not playing the market,'' said trader Ed
Kevelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``I think they're waiting for
some real substantial news. They're not reacting any more to the
bullish news and rumors. You get a sense it's going to be a real
drawn-out thing.''
   Light sweet crude oil fell $2.04 to $31.96 per barrel for
December delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Later contract months all fell by the market-imposed daily limit of
$1 per barrel. Volume was light.
   Crude had opened lower in New York following a pattern set
earlier in London's petroleum market. Prices stayed down all day.
   Analysts said oil traders have calmed down recently as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, particularly key
member Saudi Arabia, pretty much made up for the shortfall of 4
million barrels a day brought on by the international boycott of
oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Also, recent reports have shown that world demand for oil has
tapered off amid sharply higher prices.
   Oil analyst Peter Beutel, of Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in
Hoboken, N.J., agreed the market has seemed to stop moving on
tidbits of news, at least for the past week. He nonetheless said
the bullish news has perhaps kept oil prices propped up.
   ``One thing that kept prices high last week was a constant
stream of comments from the White House,'' Beutel said. In a series
of Republican campaign appearances, President Bush pointedly
refused to rule out the use of force to push Iraqi troops out of
occupied Kuwait and said his patience was waning.
   Other news, such as Bush's announcement he would visit troops in
the Gulf for Thanksgiving, has given traders a sense that the
crisis will drag on for a while without escalating into a shooting
war.
   Senior oil analyst Ann-Louise Hittle of Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. said part of crude's initial rapid rise came at a time when
OPEC members could not agree on whether they would lift production
quotas to make up for the shortfall of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.
   Now they have stepped up production and the shortfall has been
virtually eliminated, so the oil market has fallen back.
   Refined petroluem products weakened along with crude in Monday's
session.
   Home heating oil was off 2.96 cents at 84.46 cents a gallon on
contracts for December delivery. Unleaded gasoline dropped 1.67
cents to 87.54 cents a gallon for December delivery. Later months
closed lower for both products.
   Natural gas prices were mixed, with cold-weather months trading
higher and later months trading lower. December delivery contracts
fell 2.7 cents to $2.385 per 1,000 cubic feet.

   The board of Kimberly-Clark Corp. has elected
Wayne R. Sanders as president and chief operating officer, the
company said Monday.
   The election signals Sanders as the most likely successor to
Darwin E. Smith, who is retiring as chairman and chief executive
officer in April 1992. Smith has led Kimberly-Clark since 1971.
   The election is part of a plan implemented several years ago to
prepare for Smith's departure, said Kimberly-Clark spokeswoman Tina
Berry.
   The company has not had a president since 1985 and chief
operating officer is a new post for Kimberly-Clark.
   Sanders, 43, was most recently president of the company's
international and service and industrial operations, based in
Neenah, Wis.
   He joined the company as a financial analyst in 1975, rose
through the ranks of Kimberly-Clark's Canadian affiliate and later
became president of the company's personal care sector.
   The Dallas-based company makes Kleenex facial tissue, Huggies
diaper products, newsprint and other specialty papers.

   The stock market forged ahead Monday, extending
last week's rally on the strength of continuing hopes for lower
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.39 to 2,502.23
on top of last week's 54.70-point gain.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,029 up, 547 down and 425 unchanged.
   Analysts attribute the market's recent upswing to expectations
of a drop in interest rates.
   With evidence mounting of weakness in business activity, many
observers say, the Federal Reserve is getting more and more leeway
to relax its credit policy.
   Wall Streeters hope cheaper money will alleviate the credit
problems that have been unsettling the banking industry and the
real estate market.
   In the credit markets Monday, prices of long-term Treasury
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates,
showed gains approaching $10 for each $1,000 in face value.
   The depressed bank stocks, which began an upswing late last
week, were mostly higher again Monday. Manufacturers Hanover rose ~
to 18{; BankAmerica 1{ to 21~; J.P. Morgan 1&lsqb; to 40&lsqb;, and
C&amp;S-Sovran &lsqb; to 16 as the most active Big Board issue.
   Among other prominent financial issues, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage gained 1{ to 37}; Federal National Mortgage ~ to 30&lsqb;;
Kemper Corp. | to 19{, and Travelers Corp. { to 14&rsqb;.
   Falling oil prices provided another plus for the market. Crude
oil for December delivery dropped more than $2 a barrel, to just
under $32 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Retailing issues rallied on hopes that lower interest rates and
oil prices would help reverse the recent slide in measures of
consumer confidence. Sears Roebuck climbed } to 26&rsqb;; Kmart 1~ to
26; Woolworth 1&lsqb; to 27&lsqb;, and J.C. Penney 1| to 42.
   But Neiman Marcus Group fell 1~ to 12}. General Cinema, which
owns about 60 percent of Neiman Marcus, said it had dropped plans
to make a tender offer for the remaining stock in public hands.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 147.51 million
shares, down from 168.70 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 185.40 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $26.71 billion, or
0.92 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.42 to 171.49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.59 to 368.44, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.74 at 314.59.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
4.31 to 340.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 291.58, up 1.60.

<HEAD>Soybeans Sag to 3-Month Low as Exports Weaken, Harvest Grows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices sagged to new three-month lows Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid disappointment over export sales
and perceptions that the 1990 U.S. soybean production will exceed
expectations.
   Grain futures finished mixed.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures fell sharply; precious
metals rose; coffee was down; livestock futures were mixed; and
pork bellies soared.
   Soybean futures settled 3{ cents to 12\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in November at $5.81{ a bushel, the lowest
settlement for near-term soybeans since Aug. 2.
   Analysts traced the steep midday sell-off to two main factors:
fading hopes for sales of soybean meal to the Soviet Union and
expectations that Thursday's Agriculture Department crop report
will contain a significantly larger soybean harvest projection than
last month's government estimate of 1.82 billion bushels.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with the Chicago-based brokers' advisory
service Research Department Inc., said some of the heaviest sellers
were speculative funds that bought soybean contracts last week
expecting the Bush administration would grant export credits to the
Soviet Union to enable the Soviets to buy soybean meal and other
agricultural commodities.
   But there was no such announcement and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter indicated Monday that President Bush had not
changed his position of withholding export credits to the Soviets
until Moscow relaxes its emigration policies.
   After the close, the USDA's weekly export-inspections report
showed 7.7 million bushels of soybeans were inspected for export
last week, compared with 26.6 million a year ago.
   Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the report was another indication of slack
foreign demand for soybeans.
   The soybean harvest estimate in Thursday's USDA crop report is
widely expected to exceed last month's projection of 1.82 billion
bushels, analysts said.
   Frick said she expects the USDA to peg the soybean crop at 1.835
billion bushels, Karlin said he's looking for 1.85 billion and
Sparks Commodities Inc., a Memphis-based analytical firm, estimated
1990 U.S. soybean production at 1.9 billion bushels.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1{ cents lower with December at
$2.64\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2 cents higher with December at
$2.30} a bushel; oats were { cent lower to \ cent higher with
December at $1.21 a bushel.
   Petroleum futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange following a report that Saudi Arabian crude oil output has
reached 8.2 million barrels per day, its highest level in 10 years.
   Oil traders said realization is growing that global demand has
declined and supplies remain adequate despite the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Light sweet crude oil finished $1 to $2.04 lower with December
at $31.96 a barrel; heating oil was 2 cents to 2.96 cents lower
with December at 84.46 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.67
cents to 3.39 cents lower with December at 87.54 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures surged on New York's Commodity Exchange
in a rebound from Friday's steep decline. The markets regained more
than half of what they lost in the previous session.
   Gold settled $3.10 to $3.20 higher with December at $381.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.9 cents to 4.2 cents higher with December
at $4.227 a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures retreated for the fifth straight day on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, reflecting expectations of
heavy coffee shipments from producer countries to consumer
countries during the third quarter.
   Coffee ended 2.4 cents to 3.05 cents lower with December at 86
cents a pound.
   Frozen pork belly futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as the market posted its fourth straight daily advance on
signs that demand and fresh-belly prices have risen. Livestock
futures were narrowly mixed.
   Live cattle futures settled .30 cent lower to .10 cent higher
with December at 77.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with November at 87.32 cents a pound; live

<TEXT>
   A state bank official on Monday added his voice to
the growing criticism of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan for the switch
to a market economy, warning it could hurt overall reforms.
   The criticism followed gloomy predictions from two of the Soviet
president's economic advisers, who warned that the plan could spark
hyperinflation and cut the standard of living.
   Oleg Mozhaisky, head of the bank's hard-currency department,
told a news conference that recent Gorbachev decrees expanding the
use of hard currency were misguided.
   Referring to the use of dollars in the Soviet economy, Mozhaisky
said: ``Dollarization wouldn't bring us closer to the goals of
perestroika but would worsen the state of the ruble and could make
those goals more distant.''
   Gorbachev's compromise program for restructuring the economy was
adopted Oct. 19 by the Soviet legislature. It is already under
sharp attack in many of the 15 republics.
   Gorbachev's own advisers have expressed doubts that it will
succeed.
   The economic advisers, Nikolai Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin,
said in a letter to a liberal newspaper that Gorbachev's plan will
increase the budget deficit and disrupt economic links among the 15
Soviet republics. The Soviet Union has a deficit of 60 billion
rubles, or about $96 billion.
   ``The decrease in the standard of living of the population will
be significant before stabilization. ... The inflationary spiral is
winding up too quickly, the collapse of the consumer market is
growing and the economy is moving further from a state of
equilibrium,'' the economists said in the letter, published Sunday
in Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   The letter, signed by 11 other economists, accused the Soviet
leadership of ``indecisiveness and inconsistency'' in economic
reform.
   The statement was a rare public airing of differences between
Gorbachev and his aides.
   Shatalin, a member of Gorbachev's Presidential Council, an
advisory body, had written a plan to switch to a market system in
500 days. Gorbachev first supported it, then backed off.
   Immediately after the Gorbachev plan was adopted, Shatalin said
he supported it generally. Since then, he had refrained from public
comment.
   The criticism was particularly striking coming from Petrakov,
Gorbachev's usually loyal personal economic adviser.
   Mozhaisky told reporters he had not read the letter.
   He expressed general support for Gorbachev's economic reforms,
but took issue with two decrees: one creating an auction among
Soviet businesses for the foreign currency they hold, and the other
setting up a network of stores selling goods in hard currency, or
currency that can be converted on the world market.
   In their criticism, the economists appeared to side more with
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin than Gorbachev. Yeltsin has
described Gorbachev's plan as a ``catastrophe'' that will drive up
prices and the budget deficit and decrease the ruble's purchasing
power.
   Russia, the country's largest republic, voted to go its own way
and implement Shatalin's 500-day plan on Nov. 1. The Gorbachev plan
merged that blueprint with a more cautious plan drafted by Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   In their letter, the 13 economists also criticized Russian
officials.
   They said the Russian parliament's decision to raise purchase
prices and to consider raising pensions will mean that within six
months, ``the entire population of the republic, including
pensioners, will live worse as a result of inflation or
introduction of rationing.''
   The 500-day plan, the economists noted, had envisioned delaying
increases in pensions and prices until the slide of the ruble's
value was arrested.
   The economists also said:
   -The government's plan to raise retail prices by decree and
compensate low-income groups ``is a path to hyperinflation.''
   -The Soviet legislature's one-month delay in adopting a reform
program leaves less time by the end of this fiscal year for
reforming the banking system, controlling the budget and
undertaking tax reform. Meanwhile, they said: ``The population is
losing faith in both the reform and in authorities.''
   -That representatives of republics had agreed to a unified
economic program but because it was bypassed, they are going their
own way and ``a unified all-union market is under threat.''
   -That the government's plan to cut the budget deficit by 25
billion to 30 billion rubles in 1991 is ``absolutely unrealistic.''

<HEAD>New Technology Links Computers With Incoming Calls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM, Northern Telecom Inc. and Nynex Corp. on
Monday announced a product that links incoming phone calls at a
company or organization with computerized information on the
caller.
   The system will make it easier, for example, for customer
service representatives at a mail-order house to handle inquiries
and for public-safety officials at a college to locate a caller in
an emergency, the companies said.
   Previously, such systems only were available to companies owning
expensive in-house phone switching systems.
   The new system is aimed at companies and organizations that do
not have their own private phone system. It operates through the
electronic central-office switch of the local phone company.
   The systems match the number of an incoming phone call with a
computer file. The file then pops up on a screen, using the same
telephone network technology as residential ``caller ID'' systems
that flash the number of an incoming call on a small screen near
the telephone.
   For instance, a customer's file would appear on a screen at a
mail order catalog company where that customers has an account,
before the customer service representative even picks up the phone.
   Syracuse University will become the first phone user to
participate in a demonstration of the new system, which is called
CompuCall by Northern Telecom, a Canadian-based maker of phone
company switching gear.
   With the system, the college's in-house emergency phone number
will be linked to computerized files on the location of every phone
on campus and nearby emergency exits. The information for the
particular phone will show up on a computer screen as the call is
answered.
   Like the caller ID system, the new phone technology could raise
concerns about callers' privacy. Caller ID systems have been
criticized because they provide a caller's phone number, which can
be used without permission for marketing or other purposes.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Northern Telecom's principal
North American rival in central phone switches, does not offer a
similar system, said Joe Bellace, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst.
   However, he called the system a ``future product'' that should
not have significant earnings impact for the three participating
companies for some time.
   Northern Telecom said the system only works with International
Business Machines Corp. minicomputers, but eventually should be
expanded to other makes.
   IBM earlier this year announced a system called CallPath that
links its minicomputers with incoming phone calls over private
phone systems made by several companies.

   The dollar fell sharply Monday, reaching a new
post-war low against the German mark and a new low against the
Swiss franc, as traders continued to take a pessimistic view of the
U.S. economy.
   Gold prices rose in response to the dollar's decline.
   Analysts said there were no news developments to affect the
dollar Monday; the U.S. currency slid on the continued expectation
that the Federal Reserve would be forced to move interest rates in
this country lower to shore up the flagging economy.
   Market watchers said they expected the dollar's decline to
continue.
   ``There's no reason why the trend should not continue,'' said
Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with Bank of New
York Co.
   As long as the economy weakens, traders are expected to shun the
dollar. Like all currencies, it is supported by higher interest
rates, and the prospect of lower rates means the dollar cannot
compete against currencies of nations with higher rates.
   The dollar fell to a new post-war closing low against the German
mark. The U.S. currency closed at 1.4850 German marks, down from
1.4945 on Friday, its previous low.
   In earlier European trading, the dollar skidded to 1.4923 marks,
down from 1.5015 on Friday.
   The dollar also reached a new closing low against the Swiss
franc, ending at 1.2505 francs in New York, down from late Friday's
1.2605. The previous low was 1.2558 francs on Aug. 23.
   In Europe, the dollar also fell to 1.2505 francs, down from
1.2705 on Friday.
   The dollar also dipped below 5 French francs.
   In New York, the dollar closed at 4.9810 francs, down from
5.0180 on Friday. In Europe, the dollar dipped to 4.9875 French
francs, down from 5.0420.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included 1,116.00 Italian lire, down from 1,123.75; and
1.15875 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16475.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 127.35 Japanese yen from
129.10 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at
127.05 yen, and in New York, the dollar fell to 126.55 yen from
127.78 yen on Friday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9675 from $1.9515 late
Friday. The pound also rose in New York, where it closed at
$1.9740, up from Friday's $1.9590.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.6765 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6938; 1,116.25
Italian lire, down from 1,129.00; and 1.1586 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1653.
   Gold rose $3.10 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing
at $379.50 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid
of $378.65, up $2.40.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $377.25 a troy ounce, from
$376.25 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of
$376.30 an ounce from $375.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.13 an ounce to close at
$376.93.
   Silver rose 4.3 cents on the Commodity Exchange to close at
$4.203 a troy ounce. In earlier London trading, silver was
unchanged at a bid of $4.18.

   The market for so-called multimedia computing
got a boost Monday as Intel Corp. announced new chips that should
cut the cost of adding video technology to personal computers.
   Intel says its chips should allow computer makers to offer
machines that edit and store moving images - much like they do text
- for about $1,000 more than a regular computer.
   While similar technology exists, it costs at least $2,000 above
the price of a personal computer, Intel said.
   Intel said its technology should spur the growth of multimedia,
or the marriage of television and computing. Multimedia, which has
yet to take off, allows the data, text and interactive capabilities
of computers to be mixed with video, stereo sound, still
photographs and animation.
   Multimedia already is used fornd zeros of
computer language. Intel's chips, for example, compress video data
by a factor of at least 100 to 1.
   The images then can be stored on a computer's internal hard disk
or, for greater capacity, on a compact disk similar to those used
in home audio systems.
   Intel says its system is the only one designed for ordinary IBM
personal computers and compatible models. Competing systems require
specialized, more costly computers, said Intel spokeswoman Karen
Andring.
   Intel said its technology also is superior to systems using
video disk players to incorporate video into computer programs.
Since these systems do not convert the video into digital form, it
cannot be manipulated on the computer screen. In addition, Intel
says, its system is cheaper.
   With Intel's system, a computer user could connect a VCR to a
desktop machine and insert sections of a television program or
movie into a computer program. The system allows special video
effects such as fading, zooming and panning.
   Intel's technology originally was developed at the David Sarnoff
Research Center in Princeton, N.J. Intel bought the technology from
General Electric Co. in 1988, and since has been developing it in
conjunction with IBM.
   The technology, which Intel calls DVI, for digital video
interactive, originally took up seven computer boards and cost
about $22,000. In February, Intel made the same system available on
two computer boards for $2,000.
   At a demonstration Monday in New York, Intel announced it had
shrunk much of the technology to fit onto two fingernail-sized
computer chips for under $100. Further enhancements should make the
chips even more powerful and cheaper, Intel said.
   However, the chips only provide the heart of the system, so
other components are needed to actually incorporate mulitimedia
into computers, boosting the price to the expected $1,000 level.
   Among computer and software makers exploring Intel's technology
or already offering it are American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,
Compaq Computer Corp., Microsoft Corp., Lotus Development Corp.,
Olivetti of Italy and Toshiba, Aiwa and Matsushita of Japan, Intel
said.
   In addition, PictureTel Corp., a maker of video phones, is
collaborating with Intel in research that could slash the price of
video phones and make the technology common on personal computers,
said Norman Gaut, PictureTel's chairman.

   European Community agriculture and
trade ministers late Monday suspended talks on a proposal to cut
farm subsidies until Tuesday morning to give time for high-level
consultations between EC governments.
   Officials said several EC heads of state, including French
President Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
were talkin by phone in attempts to arrange a final farm plan.
   An EC official who asked not to be named said negotiators were
treating the Tuesday meeting as an ``unofficial deadline'' for an
agreement.
   The ministers are working under the threat that failure to reach
agreement soon could torpedo talks to liberalize world trade.
   The issue of farm subsidies is one of the key obstacles to the
broader trade negotiations. The United States and other
agricultural exporters contend the EC unfairly subsidizes farmers,
enabling them to sell food more cheaply abroad.
   Officials said Italian trade minister Renato Ruggiero told the
ministers during Monday's meeting that it was ``crucial'' they
agree on cutting subsidies for farmers.
   If not, the United States would use the EC's failure to do so as
a reason to abandon the Uruguay Round talks, a four-year effort of
more than 100 nations to liberalize world trade, the officials
quoted Ruggiero as saying.
   Those talks are due to end in December.
   British Agriculture Secretary John Gummer said, ``If we don't
find a solution now, we will look ridiculous.''
   The ministers were at odds over a proposal to trim farm
subsidies on major crops by 30 percent over a period of years.
   France and Germany have been insisting on guarantees that the
trims would not seriously hurt their farmers. In preparation for
Monday's meeting, the European Commission, the community's
executive body, devised a list of guarantees designed to allay the
nations' fears but it was not clear whether it would succeed.
   ``Logically, there ought to be no reason why we can't come to an
agreement,'' said Gummer.
   But another community official said, ``I don't see any change. I
don't see any movement.'' The ministers were repeating the same
position they have held for a month, the official said.
   France, the community's largest exporter of farm products, still
appeared to have doubts.
   Ministers from the 12 EC nations failed in six tries last month
to reach an accord.
   Ruggiero opened Monday's session saying the offer of a 30
percent cut in subsidies ``is not minimal, but of great value.''

   Probursa, Mexico's third largest stock
brokerage, opened a U.S. office Monday with plans to use it to help
find funding for Mexican companies.
   Probursa said its decision to open the New York office was
prompted by the increasing privatization of many sectors of the
Mexican economy, particularly banking, as well as by the surge in
Mexican manufacturing and the possibility that a U.S.-Mexican free
trade pact will be reached.
   ``As Wall Street is feeling the effects of the sluggish United
States economy, leading investors are looking elsewhere to place
their investment dollars,'' said Jose Madariaga, Probursa's
chairman.
   ``Increasingly, they are turning to the Mexican market, which is
no longer depending only on oil exports,'' said Madariaga, who also
is chairman of the Mexican stock exchange.
   The New York office is Probursa's first outside Mexico, where it
operates 25 retail brokerage outlets.

   Sun Microsystems Inc. on Monday introduced
four new workstations that it called faster and more sophisticated
machines which form the high end of the company's desktop line.
   The new SPARCstation 2 computers are almost twice as fast as the
SPARCstation 1 models introduced last year, Sun said. They range
from a $14,995 monochrome-display workstation to a $49,985
color-screen version offering three-dimensional modeling and
animation.
   Workstations are high-powered personal computers aimed primarily
at scientists, engineers and others who need great computing
capacity or high-quality graphics.
   ``The addition of the SPARCstation 2 line with its great
graphics simply makes this environment better for technical
professionals who have real performance needs,'' said Scott
McNealy, president and chief executive officer of the Mountain
View-based company.
   Like its predecessor, the SPARCstation 2 uses the popular Unix
operating system and Open Look graphical interface and packages the
electronics in a small ``pizza box'' enclosure. But while the
earlier models offered from 8 to 48 megabytes of memory, the new
ones offer 16 to 96 megabytes. A megabyte is roughly a million
characters of information.
   The new line also includes a low-cost file server, a computer
that acts as the hub of a network of desktop machines.
   The new products are being offered in addition to the $4,995
SPARCstation SLC and $7,995 IPC desktops introduced last year.

   Local and national labor leaders pledged $2
million Monday to help the unions striking the Daily News, while
management fought to get the newspaper to readers.
   The tabloid has continued to publish since the strike began
nearly two weeks ago with editors joined by reporters and editors
from other newspapers, union members who have crossed the picket
line and new hires.
   But with editorial and production problems apparently licked the
job of getting the paper to would-be readers remained.
   Eight unions struck on Oct. 25, followed the next day by the
Newspaper Guild, which represents reporters, photographers and
other workers. About 2,000 people are on strike, although some have
returned in various Guild departments.
   The unions went on strike over what they termed unfair labor
practices. They had been involved in negotiations since January
over contracts that expired in March.
   The printers stayed on the job to preserve lifetime job
guarantees negotiated when automation was introduced.
   Nine other unions representing groups from Teamsters to teachers
agreed Monday to co-sign a $2 million loan to assist the strikers.
   ``We were very delighted to hear this morning that they were
going to help us reach a strike fund of $2 million,'' said George
McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, a
coalition of 10 unions at the News.
   ``We need it to go out on radio and TV and fight the enemy,'' he
said.
   News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson has declined to provide printing
and circulation figures since Friday. Figures provided by the News
have been widely disputed.
   However, Robinson did say the News has had ``tremendous success
getting the paper out.'' Hawkers are giving away free papers,
including 50,000 on Sunday. More are to be placed in regional
malls, but she would not disclose where.
   ``We're moving toward our normal routine circulation,'' she
said. The News' circulation is 1.09 million on weekdays and 1.4
million on Sundays. It is the third largest metropolitan daily in
the country.
   However, News management sources speaking on the condition of
anonymity said the paper printed 600,000 copies of its Sunday
editions.
   A source at a rival newspaper, also speaking anonymously, said
its circulation people estimated the News distributed 257,000
copies Sunday, including home delivery. That would be down from
300,000 distributed on the first Sunday of the strike, the source
said.
   Since the strike began, most of the sports department, the
library staff, the features department and the photography staff
have returned. A News official said that about 150 Guild members in
the 350-member editorial department have returned, including seven
on Monday.
   At least two others who went back to work rejoined the strike on
Monday.
   Violence filled the first few nights near the Brooklyn printing
plant and there have been arsons and misdemeanor charges laid to
the unions for damage done to newsstands.
   McDonald and other union leaders have denounced violence and
said they would call upon their members to refrain from it.
   ``There's no violence there,'' McDonald said Monday. ``I've
talked to a lot of newsdealers about not carrying the Daily News.
But that's all I did. Those aren't threats.''
