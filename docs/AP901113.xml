<HEAD>Report: Army Overcharged Soldiers, Diverted Money to VIPs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army overcharged its personnel for
temporary lodging and diverted the money to projects like the
renovation of a VIP house and two custom throw rugs costing $3,600,
congressional investigators say.
   The General Accounting Office, in reviewing the daily fees
assessed to soldiers staying at special housing during training,
found that from 1985 to 1989, two Army commands amassed more than
$70 million from inflated charges assessed against the per diem
allowance given soldiers.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated that the
amount could rise to more than $100 million after calculating
figures for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   ``Some Army installations have overcharged soldiers for
transient lodgings and ... used the procees to subsidize Morale,
Welfare and Recreation activities - officers' clubs, golf courses,
arts and crafts facilities and lodging for visitors,'' the GAO said
in a report released last week.
   The agency blamed the problems on the absence of effective
controls and inadequate management attention.
   In one instance, the Army used the additional money to fully
renovate a four-bedroom house that serves as distinguished
visitors' quarters. Among the costs were about $144,000 for
customized furnishings, drapes and carpets, including two throw
rugs that totaled $3,600.
   The Army installation also planned to spend about $272,000 for
special stationery and landscaping but when questioned by the GAO,
it lowered its cost projections to $81,600.
   The GAO did not specify at which installation the renovation
occurred, but its study examined domestic facilities.
   The agency said the Training and Doctrine Command and Forces
Command accumulated the inflated charges. The money comes from the
billions of dollars the Army spends each year to train its
personnel, with a portion for the per diem paid to soldiers
undergoing training.
   In another case, the GAO found that a large office space in
transient quarters was converted into an exercise room with
equipment even though a fully equipped gym was across the street.
   ``According to installation officials, the exercise room was
provided to meet commercial hotel standards and to ensure that
guests were not inconvenienced,'' the GAO said.
   In a response included in the report, the Defense Department
said it has taken steps to review and correct the problems
identified by the GAO. It said it also is studying current
transient housing policies.
   ``It should be noted that the identified problems occurred
during a period of major policy transition in which the department
adopted practices to operate nonappropriated fund programs and
facilities in a businesslike manner,'' said Christopher Jehn,
assistant secretary of defense for force management and personnel.
   The GAO also found that the Army paid for more expensive
off-base lodgings for personnel when there were vacancies at the
designated transient quarters. During one month at an installation,
the lodging office authorized off-base per diem for 146 personnel
for a total of 1,939 days.
   But during the same period, 206 reservations were canceled or
never claimed, amounting to 5,040 days available to house
personnel.
   The GAO recommended that the overcharges be returned either to
the original appropriations or to the U.S. Treasury. The Pentagon,
which generally agreed with the GAO's suggestions, did not concur
on returning the money.
   The Defense Department proposed disbursing the money based on a
department legal interpretation of the issue.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense, requested the report.

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Without complaint, George Phelan
left his family and his law practice to do his military duty as a
reservist in Operation Desert Shield.
   He missed the first birthday of his daughter, Asia, Nov. 6. He
celebrated his 40th birthday Sept. 4 at gas mask school with his
army buddies at Fort Devens, Mass.
   His father's handling mortgage payments and monthly bills
because Phelan's Japanese-born wife's English isn't good enough to
take care of things.
   Before he left for active duty, Phelan had two days to find
another lawyer to handle his pending cases.
   He didn't have time to tell all his clients he was leaving, so
he wrote them letters and took out a newspaper ad saying he'd be
away for an indefinite time.
   And the switch from civilian to military pay has meant a
substantial cut in income.
   But despite all the disruptions, you won't hear any gripes from
Phelan, of Fall River, Mass.
   ``When your country calls you to defend it and defend its
interests, I think it's a small sacrifice to pay,'' said Phelan, a
U.S. Army major in the 46th Judge Advocate-General's detachment in
Saudi Arabia, the first reserve unit activated in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``It's my duty to be here. You've got to put the inconvenience
aside and put your mind to your work,'' he said. ``As simplistic
and naive as it might sound, I'm proud to be over here.''
   The call-up is the first of reservists and National Guard in 20
years, and the largest since the 1950-53 Korean War.
   More than 34,000 citizen-soldiers have been called to active
duty for a minimum of 90 days. More will follow under President
Bush's announcement that up to 150,000 reinforcements will join the
230,000 American troops confronting Saddam Hussein following his
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Like Phelan, the reservists were plucked from the civilian life
as part of their military obligation.
   ``It's something you've got to be willing to do even though it
might be unexpected and certainly inconvenient from a business and
personal point of view,'' the soft-spoken Phelan said.
   He left the modest ranch home he bought last year to sleep on a
cot in a tent pieced together with ponchos, shelter halves and
plywood boards.
   Instead of lawyerly blue suits, he wears desert camouflage
fatigues. Instead of handling civilian cases, he advises military
commanders on disciplinary matters.
   ``The money part's going to hurt, but you can always make the
money up in the long run,'' Phelan said.
   He admitted tht ``the longer I'm away from the practice the
more difficult it'll be to revive when I get home.''
   But he stressed: ``The thing that eats at me is not being able
to enjoy things I'll never be able to recapture, like my daughter's
first birthday. The first teeth, walking for the first time, saying
her first words - those things you can't get back because they only
happen one time.''
   Back home, Phelan had more than 500 clients a year in his
one-man law practice. He also provided legal services to about 500
elderly people.
   He's only had one contact with the attorney now handling his
cases. And it would be impossible to run his affairs while
soldiering in Saudi Arabia.
   For the most part, reservists are putting their hardships aside.
   ``We obviously had to do some juggling,'' said Col. Kevin
Murphy, 44, of Hanover, Mass., who's also a reservist lawyer
specializing in financial planning. ``We're making sacrifices, but
it's something we're doing willingly.''
   For people used to the freedoms of civilian life, they've had to
adapt to communal showers, waiting in line at smelly latrines,
eating military chow and taking what spartan-like recreation they
can.
   The physical discomforts can be overcome. What affects them most
is what's missing in their personal lives.
   ``The biggest battle is within ourselves, keeping our minds
right,'' said Staff Sgt. Paul Boyd, 37, of Murfreesboro, Tenn., a
National Guardsman assigned to the 130th Rear Area Operations
Center.
   ``One of the things I've learned here is what's important. It's
not a house, a boat, a car. None of the material things mean
anything. It's my loved ones that count,'' he said.
   ``I despise the United States Army. It's the most screwed up,
disorganized organization I've even been associated with.''
   National Guard Sgt. Gerald McCormick's wife is expecting their
first child in December. Missing the birth is more of a loss than
the financial consequences of switching from being a financial
planner to a soldier.
   ``It's just lost time you won't ever make up,'' said McCormick
of Nashville, Tenn.
   When he gets home, he said, ``I'll never complain about living
conditions again.''

   His passport says he is a citizen of Germany. He
speaks its language with perfect fluency and has a law degree from
one of its finest universities. His wife and two children are
German.
   But one day, Vu Dinh Nimh went to an unemployment agency to see
about a job. He said the man at the reception desk directed him to
a special section for foreigners.
   ``Second floor,'' the man said.
   ``But I'm German,'' Vu told the man.
   ``You're not German,'' the man said. ``You don't even belong
here. Why don't you go back where you came from?''
   So Vu went back to where he came from, back to his soot-covered
tenement, back to his a rundown neighborhood, back to his family in
their cramped apartment in the capital of the new Germany.
   Vu is a Vietnamese native who came here in 1974 to study at East
Berlin's prestigious Humboldt University and fell in love with a
German woman who worked in the math department.
   He's also one of thousands of foreign-born residents who believe
they are being shut out of the former nation's job market as it
struggles to adapt to a free market.
   About 95,000 Vietnamese, Mozambicans and Cubans worked in the
country under contracts made with their countries by the old
Communist government of what was East Germany.
   Gabriela Endert-Reinhart, a spokeswoman for the employment
office in Berlin, said there were no statistics on how many of them
are still working, but most have left the country and many of those
remaining are jobless.
   ``It's Germany's shame that people we invited here to work are
being unfairly fired,'' she said.
   Most the the guest workers, about 60,000, are Vietnamese. About
3,800 of the 4,600 in eastern Berlin have lost their jobs, said
Tran Manh Tuan, Vietnamese diplomatic attache in Berlin.
   Foreigners have become victims of violent attacks and increasing
hostility in eastern Germany, a situation blamed in large part on
the dire economic situation.
   Vu had to go back to Vietnam when he completed his education in
1979, but came back three years later as a guest worker in a
factory. He married his college sweetheart, Jutta Kerger, and the
couple built a life.
   He eventually got a decent job as a translator for 200
Vietnamese workers at the Gold Point shoe factory in Berlin. In
August, however, those workers were let go.
   Vu said he has had no success finding work and doesn't expect
to. The family has applied for permission to immigrate to Canada.
   The couple and their two children - 3-year-old Martin and Emily,
6 - live in the drab Lichtenberg district of Berlin.
   Recently, Vu said he took Emily to her school and a group of
high school students nearby shouted racial and anti-foreigner
epithets.
   ``They said, `Today we'll let you live, but next time we'll kill
you,''' recalled Vu, 37.
   Another time, he took Martin to a grocery store to buy bread. A
group of neo-Nazi skinheads loitering outside refused to let them
enter.
   ``There never used to be problems before the economic situation
got worse,'' Vu says. ``I could say `good day' to people on the
street and they would say `good day' back.''
   In the family's neat, clean, tiny two-room apartment, the door
has a sticker - a red maple leaf, the symbol of Canada. They think
of Canada as a land tolerant of foreigners and mixed marriages, a
place with no barriers to employment for smart, competent people.
   They live three doors down from the house where Jutta lived as a
child, a neighborhood where they could once stroll together.
   Now, they can't wait to leave.

<HEAD>Dog's Tail Apparently Starts House Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire that destroyed a house Tuesday
apparently started when a 3-year-old boy set his pet dog on fire
with a cigarette lighter, fire officials said.
   District Fire Chief Paul Hemmeter said the boy told a paramedic
at the scene what happened.
   ``The little boy told her ... `Toto was bad. Toto bit me. I set
fire to Toto's tail,''' Hemmeter said.
   The boy, his grandmother and two other children were in the
house when the fire started shortly after midnight. All escaped
without serious injury, he said. The small, long-haired dog was not
found. Hemmeter said he believes the pet died in the fire.
   Hemmeter said the grandmother had fallen asleep on a couch while
watching television when the boy apparently used a cigarette
lighter to set the dog's tail on fire.
   ``It's possible that the boy simply set fire to the bedclothes
as he was setting fire to the dog,'' Hemmeter said. ``But from the
amount of fire they had, the dog probably ran from place to place
setting fires.''
   He said all the evidence supports the boy's version of how the
fire started and no family members contradicted his account.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - A woman charged in the 1986
arsenic-poisoning death of her boyfriend administered repeated
doses of the poison to her two husbands, one of whom died, a
prosecutor charged Monday.
   In closing arguments, the defense said the state had failed to
prove that Blanche Taylor Moore killed her boyfriend, Raymond Reid.
   Mrs. Moore, 57, is on trial for first-degree murder in the death
of Raymond Reid.
   She also is charged in the death of her first husband, James
Taylor, in 1973 and with two counts of assault in the near lethal
arsenic poisoning last year of her now-estranged husband, the Rev.
Dwight Moore. She will be tried on those charges later.
   Prosecutors used those poisonings in the four-week trial in an
effort to establish a pattern that pointed to Mrs. Moore.
   ``When you combine all the evidence, what hits you directly in
the face? Forsyth County District Attorney Warren Sparrow asked the
jury.
   ``There was arsenic in Mr. Taylor ... repeatedly administered,''
Sparrow said. ``What about Dwight Moore? The same thing. The
fundamental picture is repeated doses of arsenic.
   ``This is not circumstantial, this is direct and powerful
scientific evidence that points unerringly at the defendant,'' he
said.
   Prosecutors have said they will ask for the death penalty if
Mrs. Moore is convicted.
   Defense attorney David Tamer said the state's case was nothing
more than circumstantial, saying that at no point did any witness
testify about a specific time when Mrs. Moore poisoned Reid.
   ``The issue in this case is to identify the person who is
responsible,'' Tamer said. ``That question is the one on which this
case turns. Just because they had elevated arsenic levels does not
identify her as the perpetrator.''
   Mrs. Moore testified last week that she didn't poison Reid and
lovingly cared for him during his stay in hospital before he died.
   ``I know arsenic was found in these three people, but I know
that I didn't do it,'' she said. ``I've never physically harmed
other people. To physically harm a person, no, I did not do that.''
   Defense attorneys say the real attacker confessed his crime in a
letter to Mrs. Moore.
   Handwriting experts differed over whether the letter could have
been written by Mrs. Moore or who defense attorneys say penned it -
deceased acquaintance Garvin Thomas.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military instructor stabbed the dummy
in the heart with a commando knife, and snapped at a group of Iraqi
Popular Army recruits: ``This is your weapon to kill.''
   One by one, the men dressed in camouflage fatigues lined up and
stabbed the dummy in what was supposed to be hand-to-hand combat
training at a suburban Baghdad soccer ground.
   After Iraq's million-member regular army, these men and women
are Saddam Hussein's second line of defense in the confrontation
with the U.S.-dominated multinational force.
   Every day, the Iraqi authorities organize marches through
Baghdad and other cities by Popular Army recruits, among them
elderly, gray-haired men and gun-toting women, some with heads
covered by scarves in the Islamic tradition.
   Teen-age boys clutch rocket-propelled grenade launchers and
chant: ``Down, Down, Bush!''
   Iraqi officials boast that 8 million men and women have
volunteered for the Popular Army in a wave of patriotic fervor
supposedly sparked by Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But Western and Asian military experts in Iraq estimate that the
force's strength is probably closer to 600,000 personnel, a 25
percent increase over its pre-invasion numbers.
   ``We train on all weapons, but the emphasis is on close-combat
weapons and hand-to-hand fighting,'' said Abdul Amin Jamil, one of
the instructors.
   ``My son's in the army and I'm getting trained so that I can
fight alongside him,'' said 51-year-old Karim Ali, holding an AK-47
assault rifle in one hand and patting a dagger hanging from his
webbing belt.
   ``I may be needed to defend my country,'' said Fersan Hamid, a
15-year-old schoolboy. ``I'm willing to go to Kuwait and fight.''
   Officials claim the volunteers reported to be flocking to join
the militia include Palestinians, Egyptians, Syrians, Sudanese and
other Arabs.
   State TV regularly shows zealous recruits chanting undying
allegiance to Saddam and military officials handing out guns to
young and old to defend the republic.
   Diplomats question how far the average Iraqi is prepared to go
to defend a government as repressive as Saddam's. Still, the
Popular Army is everywhere, guarding banks, embassies, hotels and
government buildings.
   With the prospect of war looming, the militia is reported to
have been deployed in some numbers across Kuwait, occupying
abandoned homes and government buildings.
   Popular Army cadres are trained for two months - two hours a
day, five days a week - in light weapons, anti-tank weapons and
anti-aircraft guns.
   After training, each recruit is given a firearm and allowed to
keep it. They are required to report to their bases every week to
determine if they're needed for active duty.
   The militia was initially formed by Saddam in 1970 as the
paramilitary wing of the ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party. Its
main function was to act as an ideological counterweight to the
army to prevent any attempt at a military coup.
   Led by one of Saddam's closest associates, Deputy Prime Minister
Taha Yassin Ramadan, the well-armed militia has been responsible
for guarding the political leadership.
   From an original strength of around 3,000, the Popular Army
swelled to around 450,000, including 40,000 women, during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. It was deployed at the front and suffered
heavy casualties. Some 10,000 men were captured.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqi regular forces often
resented having the less experienced militiamen deployed alongside
them.
   Western diplomats and Western military experts still doubt the
Popular Army's fighting abilities, but some Asian diplomats believe
that the Popular Army cadres could put up a fight if necessary.

<HEAD>Leaner USDA Select Beef Reaching Supermarkets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meat researchers have developed a new grade of
beef with half the fat of the usual cuts that may be quite
appealing to consumers watching their calories and cholesterol.
   Supermarkets are starting to carry meat labeled USDA Select that
has 40 percent to 55 percent less fat than completely trimmed,
well-marbled meat graded USDA Choice, said Dr. Larry Cundiff, a
genetics expert at the Agriculture Department's Meat and Animal
Research Center.
   ``USDA Select beef contains about 40 calories per ounce compared
with 43 to 50 calories for USDA Choice beef,'' said Cundiff. ``This
resembles the difference between regular and 2 percent low-fat milk
in the dairy case.''
   He said scientists have been working for 20 years to
characterize breeds of cattle for leanness, tenderness, juiciness
and flavor of the meat.
   The search for leaner beef led to crossbreeding Hereford and
Angus breeds with 24 European breeds known for their leanness.
   Butchers at two large supermarket chains in the Washington, D.C.
area said that Select cuts are not as tasty or tender as Choice,
but are less expensive.
   Chef Gus, at Blackie's House of Beef restaurant in Washington,
said he wouldn't serve Select beef.
   ``This is very lean meat. A different texture,'' he said. ``You
have to chew it a very long time.''
   Cundiff and his colleagues, whose lab is at Clay Center, Neb.,
have worked to identify breeds or breed crosses that help improve
tenderness while reducing fat.
   ``Piedmontese cattle are an Italian breed with 11.5 percent more
lean meat than Hereford and Angus,'' said Cundiff. ``Their
offspring produce lean, exceptionally tender meat.''
   He said about 40 percent of U.S. cattle already have at least
some of the genetic makeup of the newer European breeds. The Clay
Center lab keeps about 200 animals of each European breed,
including British, Continental and South Asian cattle, for its
research.
   ``We believe that our research has helped the industry produce
leaner beef,'' said Cundiff.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Household liquid detergents and cooking oils
are being recommended by Agriculture Department researchers as
low-cost, extremely effective killers of garden pests.
   ``This is great stuff for the homeowner,'' said Dr. Thomas
Henneberry, a USDA insect expert. ``It's completely non-toxic and
simple to mix up. It's as effective as an insecticide.''
   He said it may be even more effective than chemicals because
many pests have developed a resistance to such sprays.
   ``We can mix up a gallon of this home brew for less than 30
cents,'' said Dr. George Butler, one of Henneberry's colleagues.
``Commercial insecticide mixes for the homeowner can cost at least
$1 a gallon. And we have a pest spray that is environmentally
clean.''
   Henneberry and Butler said their detergent-oil mix has been
effective against ``some of the worst insects and mites,''
including aphids, whiteflies and spider mites.
   The scientists say homeowners should mix one tablespoon of
dishwashing detergent and one cup of oil - either peanut,
safflower, corn, soybean or sunflower.
   When ready to use, mix one to 2{ teaspoons of the prepared
solution to one cup of water. Then spray on infested plants using a
pump sprayer like the one on a bottle of window cleaner.
   The researchers have used the mixture successfully on eggplant,
carrots, lettuce, Swiss chard, celery, watermelon, pepper and
cucumber.
   ``We found the only disadvantage is that squash, cauliflower and
red cabbage are sometimes hurt,'' Butler said. ``The oil may burn
the tender leaves of these plants.''
   The oils are toxic to insects, while the dishwashing detergent
acts as an emulsifier, making the mixture adhere more readily to
the plant.
   ``The key to control is getting the oil-detergent mixture on the
insects,'' said Henneberry. ``Usually, these common pests seek
protection from the sun and wind by hiding under plant leaves. Be
careful to spray all leaf and stem surfaces with a light coat.''
   He recommended checking again about one week to 10 days after an
application.

<HEAD>Social Security Now Off-Limits for Future Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the elderly are claiming a big
victory because new budget rules make the $265 billion Social
Security system virtually untouchable in future efforts to reduce
the federal deficit.
   The change has critics complaining that it makes little sense to
exempt the government's single biggest domestic program from future
attempts to narrow the budget shortfall.
   But it is a relief for more than 39 million elderly, handicapped
and other Americans who get monthly checks from the program - and
for politicians loath to cut the politically popular pension
system.
   ``It's an important victory,'' said spokesman Bill Ritz of the
National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, which
lobbies for senior citizens.
   In federal budget politics, removing one program from possible
cuts simply means that other areas are exposed to potentially
deeper reductions. As a result, some defenders of other programs
are upset by the favorable treatment for Social Security.
   ``Whether they're elderly or children, if they're poor, they're
poor,'' said Susan Rees, executive director of the Coalition on
Human Needs, a Washington-based group that champions aid for
low-income Americans of all ages. ``Why should one have to
sacrifice for the other?''
   As part of their budget deal last month, the Bush administration
and congressional leaders agreed to take Social Security out of the
calculations used to determine the federal deficit.
   Proponents said with the pension program running an annual
surplus of tens of billions of dollars, the overall budget gap was
being shrunk artificially under the old system.
   That sounds like a dry accounting change, but it's not. What it
really means is there is no longer any reason to look to Social
Security for budget savings because cutting the program won't make
the pool of red ink any smaller.
   Groups working for the elderly had been pressing lawmakers to
make the change for years. They argued that since Social Security
pays for itself by payroll tax deductions, it has nothing to do
with the burgeoning federal deficit and thus should not be asked to
help solve that problem.
   ``What's the rationale for keeping it in there, other than
trying to dodge difficult choices elsewhere in the budget,'' said
Martin Corry, director of federal affairs for the American
Association of Retired Persons, the nation's biggest organization
for seniors.
   Social Security benefits average $571 a month this year and will
climb to $602 on Jan. 1 when a 5.4 percent inflation adjustment
takes effect.
   ``Those are earned benefits,'' Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the Senate Finance Social Security subcommittee, said
last week. ``That's not the government's money.''
   In political terms, cutting Social Security has been off-limits
for years because the elderly have proven they are a voting bloc to
be reckoned with. That lesson was driven home dramatically a few
years ago.
   In 1985, the Senate's majority Republicans agreed with the White
House to a deficit-reduction plan that included a freeze in Social
Security's annual inflation increase. The Senate adopted the
proposal, 50-49, with the deciding vote cast by then-Vice President
George Bush.
   Two months later, President Reagan backed away from the measure
after Democrats agreed to allow higher defense spending. That left
Republican lawmakers in an awkward position they soon paid for:
when the 1986 election was over, the GOP had lost control of the
Senate and has yet to regain it.
   Ever since, budget writers have been reluctant to even consider
reining in Social Security costs.
   Because of that, some activists say the new budget process means
little.
   ``Congress wasn't going to cut Social Security, and taking it
out of the budget calculations was just one more symbolic way to
show it's politically untouchable,'' said Marsha Simon, legislative
director for Families USA, a lobbying organization for the elderly.
   The government spent $246 billion on Social Security in the
fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 - 19.9 percent of the entire $1.24
trillion federal budget. The only budget component that was bigger
was defense, at $297 billion.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which studies
budget issues for Congress, projects Social Security spending to
grow by about 7 percent a year, reaching $265 billion this fiscal
year and $334 billion by 1995.

<HEAD>Pakistan's Nuclear Program is Threatening to Rupture Ties to U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   With the fear of Soviet aggression no
longer serving as glue, the U.S.-Pakistan relationship is
threatening to come apart under the strain of frictions over
Pakistan's nuclear program, diplomats say.
   Congress and the new government of Pakistan appear ready to walk
away from the four-decades-old relationship that served as a
cornerstone of U.S. policy in South Asia and gave Washington an
important friend in the Moslem world.
   In October, the United States demanded that Islamabad reverse
its nuclear program and froze $573 million of economic and military
assistance to Pakistan, part of a six-year, $4-billion aid package
begun in 1987.
   After winning elections last month by capitalizing on growing
resentment of U.S. influence in this Moslem country of 110 million,
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and his right-wing coalition have
declared they can do without U.S. aid.
   ``We should tighten our belts. We should learn to run our hands
deep into our own pockets instead of stretching them before
others,'' Ishaq Khan said in a strident state-of-the-union address
last week.
   ``No matter how important foreign aid is we shall not compromise
our independence and our freedom for it. We may be poor but we
highly cherish our national honor and dignity,'' he said.
   Ishaq Khan is expected to meet with Vice President Dan Quayle in
Japan this week to discuss the nuclear issue and American aid. But
analysts and diplomatic sources doubt Pakistan will be able to
adequately reassure Washington.
   ``Although a few screws may be missing or bolts left to tighten,
the United States is convinced that Pakistan has the bomb,'' said
one diplomatic source, insisting he not be identified further.
   Pakistan is the third-largest receipient of U.S. aid behind
Egypt and Israel, and the benefits are easily recognizable in a
country relatively free of the daunting poverty that plagues much
of the subcontinent.
   But before assistance is granted, President Bush must certify to
Congress that Pakistan neither possesses nor is building nuclear
weapons.
   For more than a decade, the United States found reasons to look
the other way as evidence mounted that Pakistan was moving closer
to becoming a nuclear power.
   That was particularly true at the height of the war in
neighboring Afghanistan. Determined to keep Pakistan away from
Soviet influence, and beholden to Islamabad for funneling hundreds
of millions of dollars in arms to the Moslem resistance, Washington
managed to secure certification.
   But in December 1988, diplomatic sources say, Pakistan was
warned to hold its nuclear program in check.
   ``Early this year their assurances no longer held up,'' said one
Western diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Diplomatic sources say Pakistan crossed the nuclear threshhold
when relations with neighboring India began to deteriorate. There
have been fears in recent months that the two traditionally hostile
neighbors would go to war for a third time over Kashmir, the
disputed mountain territory claimed by both.
   India exploded a nuclear device in 1974, and neither country has
agreed to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which would
require them to open their facilities to periodic inspections.
   Washington's decision to freeze aid, coming on the eve of
national elections, embittered Pakistanis and fueled criticism of
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was overwhelmingly
defeated in the Oct. 24 parliamentary vote.
   Most thought the anti-American rhetoric would subside after the
elections, but it has persisted.
   Pakistan's strategic importance to the United States has
diminished with the thaw in the Cold War and the winding down of
the war in Afghanistan.
   And with greater demands for U.S. assistance among the emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe, diplomats say, the current aid level
to Pakistan cannot be sustained.
   But others contend the United States cannot afford to lose a
friend that served as the front-line state in the fight against
Soviet communism, the window to Iran following the 1979 revolution
and an intermediary that helped Washington open the door to China.
   ``The United States doesn't have a lot of friends in the Moslem
world,'' said an Arab diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``While the Soviet threat is gone, there are other
alliances that Pakistan could enter that would not be in the U.S.'
best interests. Washington may yet again discover that a once-loyal
friend has become one of its worst enemies.''

<HEAD>Baker to Meet with Canadian Leader on Gulf</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
making a hastily arranged visit to Bermuda for talks with Canadian
External Affairs Minister Joe Clark on resolving the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Canada has dispatched more than a dozen jet fighters to the gulf
in support of the U.S.-led multinational effort there, and it has
not ruled out the possibility of sending ground forces.
   It was not clear, however, whether today's talks would touch on
a possible increase in the Canadian military contribution.
   ``The whole purpose of meeting is to get them together so they
have a chance to discuss face-to-face Baker's view of the situation
and our view of the situation,'' said Abbe Dann, Clark's
spokeswoman.
   Baker met last week with the other four members of the United
Nations Security Council during his swing through Europe and the
Middle East. He decided only last Saturday that a consultation with
Clark would be useful.
   Clark was expected to reaffirm Canada's view that Iraq must
withdraw from Kuwait - the same view that Baker heard last week in
his talks with leaders from the Soviet Union, China, Britain,
France, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the exiled Kuwaiti
regime.
   But the majority view among those Baker sounded out was that
more time is needed to give diplomacy a chance to work before the
military option against Iraq is seriously considered.
   Bush last week ordered 200,000 more American troops to the gulf
to supplement the 230,000 already there.
   Bermuda was chosen as the site for today's meeting because Clark
is en route to Europe and the Middle East for discussions on the
gulf situation. He was to leave Bermuda for London at midday after
a 90-minute discussion with Baker at the residence of the U.S.
consul general.
   After a luncheon in Bermuda with local officials, Baker planned
a mid-afternoon return to Washington to take part in a meeting
between President Bush and Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti.

   Mayor Anthony Senecal has his hand out
to panhandlers, hoping a proposed $50-a-year licensing fee will
persuade them to move on.
   ``I've always been appalled that people who come downtown to
shop are always being asked, `Have you got 25 cents? Have you got
50 cents?''' Senecal said. ``That's bull. It isn't right. Pretty
soon they're going to stop coming downtown to shop.''
   Senecal wants to require panhandlers to buy a $25 license every
six months. Violators could get a $500 fine and 10 days in jail.
   City Council is scheduled to consider the ordinance Thursday.
   James Tobin, 63, who says he ``panhandles some,'' doubted the
ordinance would do much good.
   ``I panhandle when I go broke,'' he said. ``I guess I'll buy a
license if I have to, but it ain't right. It just ain't right.''
   Robert O'Brien, spokesman for the state chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, called the proposal preposterous and said
the group may challenge it.
   Robert Bastress, an expert in constitutional law at West
Virginia University, said panhandling is a form of commercial
speech. ``The Supreme Court has recognized that commercial speech
is entitled to some protection under the Constitution, not as much
as other forms of speech, perhaps, but some protection,'' he said.
   The idea came to the mayor after three men asked him for money
during the three-block walk from his tobacco shop to City Hall.
   ``We can't afford having people on the street giving people who
come downtown the bum's rush,'' Senecal said. ``Some of these guys
get right up in your face if you refuse.''
   O'Brien said the ordinance won't solve the problem.
   ``Winos are going to take their government check, spend $25 on a
license and then panhandle freely,'' he said. ``But the guy who has
been living in Washington, D.C., and is moving back to Ohio, and
runs out of gas, and needs to panhandle to get enough money to get
home is the guy who is going to get arrested.''
   Senecal said the ordinance isn't aimed at the working poor. He
said the Salvation Army's bell-ringers and other charities also
would be exempt.
   ``What I'm after are the winos who make a good living off
government checks and beg for money the final two weeks of every
month after they blow all their government money,'' Senecal said.
   One supporter of the measure is the Rev. Bill Crowe, who
operates Union Rescue Mission in Martinsburg, a growing town of
more than 13,000 just over an hour's drive from Washington.
   The town has a 2 percent jobless rate, but its homeless shelter
usually is full and 39 of the 52 beds at the mission were occupied
on a recent night, Crowe said.
   ``There's no reason for anyone in Martinsburg to bum money or
meals or anything else,'' Crowe said. ``We serve meals 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. These people are just living off the
bottle. They just drink and drink and drink and then start
panhandling to get more money.''
   Senecal said he doesn't know if his plan would work in big
cities like Los Angeles, Detroit and New York.
   ``The biggest difference between us and New York City is we know
all our bums,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: Rights Abuses Persist In El Salvador Since Jesuit Slayings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after Salvadoran soldiers
slaughtered six Jesuit priests, a U.N. human rights expert says
abuses ranging from torture to executions persist in the Central
American nation.
   But the report cites a general decline in killings during the
first eight months of 1990, with the exception of government-backed
death squad activity.
   ``Thus far in 1990, government action against humanitarian,
trade union, peasants and other organizations has continued,'' said
Jose Antonio Pastor, a university professor from Spain who compiled
the report.
   Pastor added he ``continued to receive information about
harassment of religious organizations and workers by the
authorities.''
   The report, issued Monday, blames both the U.S.-backed
conservative government of President Alfredo Cristiani and the
leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front for
the persistent violence.
   But it indicates that both groups have sought to improve the
human rights situation.
   At least 72,000 people have been killed have been killed in the
11-year-old civil war.
   The government has cut back on summary killings since signing
the San Jose Agreement on Human Rights on July 26, and FMLN
assassinations of suspected collaborators ceased after that date,
the report says.
   The report notes 40 politically motivated summary executions of
civilians by soldiers or other security forces from January to
August, compared with 51 in the same period in 1989, citing figures
from the Archdiocesan Legal Protection Office.
   The office, however, counted 46 assassinations by death squads
in the period, compared with 17 slayings in the same months of
1989.
   The Salvadoran government's Human Rights Commission reported 42
summary killings in the first eight months of 1990, compared with
68 in the same months of 1989.
   The government did not keep figures on death squad activity.
   For the FMLN, the church counted 12 assassinations from January
to August 1990, compared with 30 during those months in 1989. The
government counted 49 in the period, compared with 173 in the first
eight months of 1989.
   The government has been severely criticized since soldiers
killed six Jesuit priests, their cook and her daughter on Nov. 16,
1989, a day after the beginning of a guerrilla offensive in the
capital that left 2,000 dead.
   Bringing the soldiers and their commanders to justice makes the
massacre ``a test case for the credibility of efforts to bring
about judicial reform in the country,'' Pastor wrote.
   ``There seems to be a lack of cooperation on the part of the
armed forces, which has gone so far as the destruction of important
evidence,'' said the report, referring to the loss of an officer's
notes made the night of the killings.
   Right-wing elements of the military and government view the
Roman Catholic Church's advocacy of human rights and social justice
as a legal adjunct to the rebel effort.
   Since the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero
during a Mass in 1980, death squads and rightists have often
targeted the clergy.
   ``Cases of politically motivated disappearances of individuals
continue to be reported,'' Pastor added. He said both death squads
and the guerrillas were probably responsible for the
disappearances.
   Pastor also found torture of prisoners continued, with the worst
treatment given to those from political organizations or unions.
   Some of the common abuses included ``long periods of
interrogation while being blindfolded and without being able to sit
down or relieve themselves, extensive beatings, the occasional use
of a hood which impedes breathing and causes fainting, immersion of
the head in tanks of water, electric shocks and threats to
themselves or their families.''
   ``Witnesses who did not belong to organizations complained only
of intense interrogation while blindfolded,'' he added.
   Pastor also said there have been reports of harassment of
priests, monks and nuns.

<HEAD>Investigators: Milken May Have Made $1 Billion More Than Disclosed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former junk bond financier Michael Milken -
once paid $550 million in a single year by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. - may have received an additional $1 billion during the 1980s,
congressional investigators say.
   Information from the General Accounting Office indicates that
about 30 limited partnerships Milken formed with other Drexel
employees paid out as much as $2 billion between 1981 and 1989, a
House subcommittee staffer said Monday, confirming earlier
published reports.
   As much as $1 billion of the money went to Milken himself, said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There was no indication how much of that amount was actual
profit, and the amount attributed to Milken was only an estimate
based on larger sums paid out by the partnerships.
   Milken's sentencing in a massive Wall Street fraud case is
expected to be scheduled soon. He could be sentenced up to 28 years
in prison.
   One of the nation's richest men, Milkin already has paid a
record $600 million in penalties. He pleaded guilty in April to six
felonies, including conspiracy, securities violations and tax fraud
for his role in the Wall Street scandals of the 1980s.
   The House source also said convicted stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky testified behind closed doors in August to the
investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee about his dealings with Milken.
   Boesky, once a leading speculator in the stock of potential
takeover targets, paid $100 million to settle insider-trading
charges, pleaded guilty to one felony and was sentenced to a
three-year prison term, which he has completed.
   Drexel settled criminal and civil charges in 1988 by agreeing to
pay a record $650 million in penalties, as well as pleading guilty
to six felony charges. The firm filed for bankruptcy reorganization
in February.
   The House subcommittee has been investigating hundreds of
Milken-created Drexel partnerships for several years, but no
evidence of illegal activity has been presented. Drexel ended the
practice shortly after it came to light two years ago.
   A spokesman for Milken declined comment on the matter.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the investigations panel
and the full Energy and Commerce Committee, wants Milken to testify
after his sentencing about trading accounts owned by the limited
partnerships he formed with Drexel co-workers, family members and
friends.
   Milken invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination when he was called to testify before the
subcommittee two years ago.
   Dingell asked the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, to
look into the partnerships.
   The partnerships bought up large amounts of junk bond issues
before they were made available to the general public. Critics say
the activity drove up the price of those issues at the expense of
Drexel customers, but there has been no final determination of the
activity's legality.
   Federal prosecutors revealed that Drexel paid Milken, mastermind
of the firm's rise to prominence in the high-yield, high-risk junk
bond business, a total of $1.1 billion between 1984 and 1987,
including $550 million the final year. That $550 million paycheck
put him the Guinness Book of World Records.
   The GAO's information consisted of a list of 30 limited
partnerships and the total amount each distributed to investors
during the 1980s. But it did not specify individual investors or
indicate how much of the payouts were profit above the initial
investment.
   The subcommittee source said investigators knew from court
documents what percentage was held in the partnerships by major
players in the Drexel scandal.
   ``It gives you a pretty good road map in terms of who was
involved in what,'' the source said.

<HEAD>Misguided Defense System May Cause Artery Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buildups of artery-clogging fatty deposits that
can cause heart attacks may result when a person's defense system
turns against the body, researchers say.
   Dr. William Hollander of Boston University said his latest
research supports the theory he pioneered two decades ago: that
hardening of the arteries is an autoimmune disease, in which the
body mistakenly destroys itself.
   The theory has become a hot topic of research in recent years as
doctors try to identify the forces that cause blood vessels to fill
up with fatty deposits like rust-encrusted pipes.
   This process, which doctors call atherosclerosis, results in a
heart attack or stroke if a clot accidentally squeezes off the flow
of blood.
   ``I would say that our findings indicate that immune factors
play a key role in the formation of the fibrous lesions that are
the fundamental cause of heart attacks and strokes,'' Hollander
said.
   Several other research teams around the world also are finding
signs that antibodies and other proteins of the body's immune
system play a role in triggering or speeding up this disease.
   ``I consider that (Hollander) is being vindicated for studies he
began many years ago,'' said Dr. Robert Wissler of the University
of Chicago. ``This all now seems to fit together into a rather
important accelerating factor in relation to atherosclerosis.''
   Hollander presented his latest evidence Monday at the annual
scientific meeting of the American Heart Association. About 26,000
doctors and other health professionals are in Dallas to hear more
than 3,000 scientific presentations.
   Blood cells ordinarily produce antibodies to fight foreign
invaders, such as bacteria and viruses. But Hollander's research
suggests that in atherosclerosis, the body produces antibodies that
seek out one variety of lipoprotein, the molecules that transport
cholesterol through the body.
   As a result, cholesterol becomes trapped in the blood vessel
walls, contributing to the damaging buildup. The arteries are
further damaged by other chemicals produced in the immune system
attack.
   Hollander has studied the process in both people and animals. In
animals, his evidence suggests that the autoimmune mistake is at
play in the deposit of fatty streaks on blood vessel walls. This is
considered to be the earliest stage of atherosclerosis and in
people occurs during childhood.
   In his latest research, conducted in people, Hollander found
that the antibodies are targeted solely against an abnormal form of
apolipoprotein B, one of the body's major cholesterol-carrying
proteins. Just why some people make a mutant form of this protein,
and whether or not it is passed on through the genes, are still not
known.
   However, the finding could help explain why some people with
seemingly healthy levels of cholesterol in their blood get heart
disease, while others escape trouble despite high levels.
   The research also raises the prospect of new ways to treat and
perhaps prevent atherosclerosis. Hollander said, for example, that
drugs that suppress the immune system might be useful against
artery disease caused largely by an immune system gone awry.
   Wissler added that researchers may someday also be able to
perform blood tests routinely to check people for the damaging
antibodies.

<HEAD>Sluggish State Tax Receipts Suggest Recession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sluggish state tax revenues, despite large
rate increases passed by some legislatures, suggest that many
states already are in a recession, according to a national survey.
   A study by the Center for the Study of the States in Albany,
N.Y., indicates that New England and mid-Atlantic states are
experiencing the weakest tax revenues, in contrast to the Far West,
where they are strongest.
   In the three months from July through September, the average
increase in state tax revenues was 5.4 percent, compared with the
same quarter a year ago. In half the states the increase was 5.1
percent or less, which is lower than the rate of inflation, the
study said.
   The revenue picture would have been even bleaker without large
tax rate increases passed in Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey and
Oklahoma. Excluding those four, the average increase was 4.9
percent.
   ``Such a small increase has important implications about both
the health of the economy and the state of state finances,'' said
Steven Gold, the center's director. ``It implies that the economies
of many states are in recession and that many state budgets are
afflicted by fiscal stress.''
   Of the three main state taxes, the corporate income tax had the
worst results with a 0.9 percent average decrease, reflecting
sharply lower profits. Twenty-three of the 42 states with corporate
income taxes reported decreased revenues from them.
   General sales tax revenue was up an average 4.5 percent, and
personal income taxes were up 5.6 percent.
   ``The sluggish growth of the sales tax indicates that
consumption spending is very weak,'' Gold said. ``The relatively
small increase in the personal income tax reflects weakness in the
growth of wages, salaries and other forms of income.''
   States with the largest revenue increases, according to the
report, were Nevada, Kentucky, Hawaii, West Virginia, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, New Jersey, Texas, Missouri, Idaho, Illinois and South
Carolina.
   Overall revenue decreases were reported by Montana, Connecticut,
New York, Massachusetts, Ohio, Wyoming and, due to an accounting
change, North Carolina.
   During legislative sessions this year, 10 states made tax
changes expected to increase annual revenue by at least 5 percent,
while seven more raised taxes by 1 percent to 5 percent, the study
said. Most are already in effect.
   The study was based on information from state officials. Three
states were not included because information was not reported:
Alaska, North Dakota and Wisconsin.
   The center is part of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of
Government, the public policy research arm of the State University
of New York.

<HEAD>Saudi Women Protesters Face Unexpected Backlash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 50 Saudi women who took to the
road last week to protest Saudi Arabia's prohibition on female
drivers are suffering an unexpected backlash, with six being
suspended from their university jobs.
   The six professors were suspended by from the social sciences
department of the all-female campus at King Saud University in
Riyadh, sources said Monday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
atmosphere at the university has been emotionally charged since the
women's protest last week. They said some students tore the
professors' name plates off their office doors and scrawled
``infidel'' in their place.
   ``There is tide of fundamentalism among the young people,'' one
said.
   There was no official comment on the university protests.
   There is no law in Saudi Arabia against women driving, but it
goes against a strict Moslem tradition observed in this country
that once kept women completely isolated at home.
   Several women in the the professional community have complained
that the driving protest could reverse significant strides for
women made over the past several years.
   ``We feel that we have taken a hundred steps back,'' said one
professional on condition of anonymity. ``Driving would have come
not tomorrow or the next day, but it would have come. Now it may be
impossible.''
   The Saudi women said they were well-treated by police during the
protest. Police stopped their cars and drove them to the police
station, where in the presence of male relatives, they signed
pledges not to repeat their actions.
   A senior Saudi official reportedly went to the police station
and kept away the religious police, known as the Committee for the
Propagation of Virtue and the Condemnation of Vice.
   Riyadh, in the conservative heartland of the Islamic nation, has
a reputation for having the strictist chapters of the muttawa - as
the religious police are known.
   The country's imams or Moslem preachers were also instructed to
tread lightly in their Friday sermons. Some, however, did call for
punishment of the ``infidels,'' claiming the protestors favored
eschewing the veil.
   All 50 women were completely veiled in black cloaks during their
protest on Nov. 6, conforming to traditional dress for women in the
Islamic kingdom.
   They rode in 15 cars and included businesswoman and housewives.
   All went with the consent of male relatives. Women in Saudi
Arabia need male permission to travel, to check into hotels and for
many other actions.
   The women said their unprecedented public demonstration had been
compelled by the Persian Gulf crisis. They said they are afraid
that if war breaks out they would be left immobile.
   Thousands of Kuwaiti women refugees and American women soldiers
have driven on the kingdom's roads since the crisis began on Aug.
2.
   The Saudi women who drove in the protest had learned to drive
outside Saudi Arabia. In their country they must resort to
chauffeurs.

   More than two months after armed Iraqi
soliders kicked in their front door and took them prisoner, Don and
Brenda Swanke were confronted by the commander of a military site
south of Baghdad.
   ``You're going to America. Pack!'' Swanke said they were told.
   The Swankes were leaving the ranks of the hundreds of Westerners
held in Iraq as ``human shields'' to discourage a feared U.S.
attack.
   They planned to depart Germany today for their home in the Los
Angeles suburb of Westlake Village. But they say their thoughts
linger on Iraq and Kuwait, where friends and others remain captive.
   ``We feel guilty because we were set free and they were not,''
said Mrs. Swanke, who spend 65 days in captivity with her husband.
   ``We want whatever has to be done to get them out,'' he said.
   The couple spoke to The Associated Press a day after they were
discharged from the U.S. Regional Air Force Hospital in Wiesbaden.
They underwent two days of physical examinations following their
release Friday.
   They both got a clean bill of health, despite a combined loss of
55 pounds.
   The couple was among more than 170 Western hostages released
following a visit to Iraq by former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
   The Swankes said they were fed ``mostly rice'' during their
captivity, but were generally treated well.
   ``I took the position that you guys are the enemies and we're
the prisoners and we'll do what you say. There was no use getting
hardnosed with them, and they were very respectful of that,''
Swanke said.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait City on Aug. 2, Swanke said the couple
found out they could still move around the city.
   ``Until Aug. 18, we could sort of roam around,'' he said.
   After the Iraqis ordered all Americans to report to the
International Hotel, Swanke said the couple tried to keep a ``low
profile'' and remained in their apartment.
   ``On te night of Sept. 5, about 7:30, we heard them (Iraqi
soldiers) kicking doors down'' at the apartment complex where they
lived.
   ``In a matter of time they came and they kicked our door down,
about 15 soldiers came in with AK-47s (assault rifles), quite
polite, but rather threatening,'' he said.
   ``They took our passports and told us to throw some things in a
bag and follow them,'' Swanke said. They also took his car keys.
   The couple were told they were illegally in Kuwait and later
taken to the Regency Hotel in Kuwait City under guard, where they
remained two nights.
   A night later they were taken to Baghdad by bus along with ``14
or 15 Americans and several British.''
   ``On the way to Baghdad an Iraqi driving my car passed the bus.
If you don't know how to take a joke, don't be a hostage,'' Swanke
said.
   He said they were taken to the Mansour Amelia hotel, and over
the days other hostages ``disapperared one-by-one out to strategic
sites.''
   After about a week, the Swankes were taken to a strategic site
in Mosul, about 240 miles north of Baghdad.
   He said they were placed in a three-story house where they could
cook for themselves with supplies provided by the Iraqis,
``although we only got about a fourth of what we asked for.''
   Later the couple were moved onto what appeared to be a missile
storage and assembly base ``in a wing of an administraton building
office with beds.'' Swanke said. He said the base was
``well-guarded.''
   ``They kept doors locked, kept us guarded and ran around with
guns,'' but ``I did not see anybody touched or directly threatened
in any manner,'' he said. Swanke became ill.
   ``It was the food, the stress,'' Mrs. Swanke said. They were
eventually moved to another site south of Baghdad, were Swanke
spent four days in a hospital.
   ``Brenda and I give Mr. Brandt total credit for getting us
out,'' Swanke said.
   Another American, Miles Hoffman of Columbus, Ga., who was shot
in the arm when he was captured in Kuwait on Sept. 5, was also
allowed to leave.
   Hoffman was discharged from the Wiesbaden hospital late Monday.
Air Force officials declined to reveal Hoffman's plans for
returning home.

   President Truman's official yacht, the USS
Williamsburg, is up for sale, but only to someone who will make it
seaworthy.
   Tara Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the District of Columbia's
Public Works Department, said the Williamsburg has been anchored
near a sewage plant for a year as the city searched for a buyer.
   She declined comment on reports that the vessel, which featured
black steel with teak trim and polished brass during its heyday,
had fallen into disrepair and that its 243-foot-hulk had trees
growing through it.
   The Kansas City Star reported Sunday that the ship had been
vandalized and that its deck was covered with broken glass and
empty beer bottles.
   Naval experts estimate that restoring the 36-foot-wide vessel
with a 14-foot-draft would cost at least $7 million - and more if
the ship is to ever sal again.
   If no one purchases the vessel, it faces demolition in July
1992, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>AIDS Activists Want Research Refocused</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS activists want researchers to turn their
attention over the next 18 months to coming up with effective
treatments for the infections that most often kill people with
AIDS.
   Members of ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, released
a detailed research plan at a meeting Monday with AIDS researchers,
saying potential therapies still have not been studied.
   ``This is a realistic plan,'' said Garance Franke-Ruta of ACT
UP. `` ... It's about removing the obstacles to getting science
done quickly and saving lives.''
   The coalition complained that research efforts have focused too
narrowly on deactivating the AIDS virus and not enough on
preventing and treating the infections that prey on the weakened
immune systems of AIDs-infected people.
   ``Most of what they're talking about is already in motion,''
said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute on Allergy
and Infectious Diseases. ``Whether these (infections) will be
conquered in 18 months, I can't predict. ... I hope we can.''
   The plan targets the five infections that kill 90 percent of
people with AIDS: pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus,
toxoplasma gondii, mycobacterium avium intracellulare and various
fungal infections.
   Though drugs have been developed to combat some of those
infections, not all patients can tolerate the treatments. And, in
some cases, the drugs are too toxic to be used with AZT, the only
FDA-approved drug that fights the AIDS virus directly.

   A California kindergarten teacher who created
a pen pal program to teach her pupils about the 50 states has been
named the nation's outstanding geography educator.
   Arlene Johnston of Solana Vista Elementary School in Solana
Beach, Calif., received the $10,000 cash award Monday, along with
an inscribed geophysical plaque and geography teaching materials
for her school.
   The Excellence in Geography Teaching Award program, established
this year by Rand McNally and the National Council for Geographic
Education, kicked off National Geography Awareness Week.
   Johnston's 26 pupils became pen pals with friends or family
members representing all 50 states. To demonstrate the program's
success, Johnston's 26 kindergarteners challenged local high school
seniors in identifying the most states on a blank map. The
youngsters won, 25 to 21.
   Officials said nearly 500 elementary and secondary teachers
competed for the award. Ten other finalists each received $500, a
crystal globe award and Rand McNally teaching materials. They were:
   Virginia Tyler, Sarasota, Fla.; Mike Mower, American Fork, Utah;
E. Harven Tewes, Fort Worth, Texas; William Herman, Noblesville,

   A Titan 4, the workhorse rocket that
will let the Pentagon reduce its dependence on the space shuttle,
lifted into orbit what was believed to be a satellite capable of
warning against missile attack.
   The 20-stories-tall Titan, America's mightiest unmanned rocket,
lit up NASA's two shuttle launch pads a few miles away - one
occupied by Atlantis, the other by Columbia - as it headed out over
the Atlantic on Monday night.
   The launch had been delayed two months by problems that included
leaking propellant.
   Air Force officials refused even to acknowledge the launch prior
to liftoff and would not disclose the nature of the payload, but
civilian experts said they believed it was a $180 million missile
warning satellite.
   A spacecraft of this type could be used to detect instantly the
launch of Iraqi missiles against sites in the Middle East, said
John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists' space
policy project.
   It was the Air Force's third launch of the Titan 4, valued at
$173 million. The first one was in 1989, and the second one in
June. Neither had a similar leak problem, said Col. Frank Stirling,
director of the Titan program.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems of Denver has a $7.1
billion contract with the Air Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets,
with an option for eight more. The Air Force wants 75 by the end of
1997.
   The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to lessen its
dependence on the pace shuttle.
   A fleet of Titans will allow the Air Force to launch with more
consistency, Stirling said. ``Should we ever have a problem or an
outage with the vehicle, we would still be able to recover and
continue operations,'' he said.
   Atlantis' flight on Thursday, during which it will put into
orbit a military satellite, is the last classified Pentagon shuttle
mission.
   Two more Defense Department shuttle flights are planned, both
next year, but they will not be surrounded by secrecy.
   NASA's shuttle, the strongest cargo carrier used in the United
States, is capable of putting a 52,000-pound payload into orbit.
   The Titan 4 can lift a 39,000-pound cargo into low Earth orbit
or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles high.

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A Willie Nelson fan says folks should help

   Now, Crowe said, Nelson's fans should return the favor with

   IRS agents have seized Nelson's properties in Texas and three
other states as partial payment for back taxes that were due

   STORM LAKE, Iowa (AP) - Labor leader Lech Walesa told college

   ``So you would all come to us and spend your dollars in

   ``On the basis of these dollars you will help us develop our

   Walesa, who is running for president of Poland, said he would
permit Americans to visit without visas and make it easier for them
to invest in Poland. He also said Iowa might have a role to play in
helping his country recover.
   ``We need machinery to work on these agricultural products. Of

   The first all-woman team to strike out for
the South Pole hopes to return from the stark polar laboratory with
valuable data on how women react to extreme cold and monotony.
   ``For us, it's not just a ski rally. We are trying to complete a
science project,'' Soviet expedition member Irina Gureva said
Monday. ``We strongly believe that women can live in the South Pole
and, alongside men, can carry out scientific research.''
   The expedition of three Americans, one Japanese and 12 Soviets
is scheduled to reach Antarctica on Nov. 23 to begin the 70-day,
800-mile trek on skis from the Soviet scientific station at Vostok
to the South Pole.
   Along the way, scientists will gather data on the women's
medical, biological and psychological reactions.
   ``The cold and wind will be something to contend with. The
altitude is something we're not sure of,'' said Julie Hyde, an
Outward Bound instructor in Ely, Minn. ``That's the kind of thing
that makes me most apprehensive. The monotony of the vast whiteness
is something I've never experienced before.''
   Some scientists have argued that previous cold weather research
on men should stand for women, but the expedition's researhers
aren't convinced.
   ``We don't know that there is a difference. But how can you say
there are no differences unless you've looked?'' asked Dolly
Lefever, a nurse-midwife from Alaska who will be studying changes
in the women's menstrual cycles.
   Studies by the Soviet scientists will be of greater scope. A
team of doctors will test blood and other bodily fluids to
determine how a woman's metabolism is affected by the extreme cold
and physically demanding conditions.
   A psychologist also will monitor how the women handle isolation
and interact with other team members.
   The expedition should hold fewer surprises for some of the
Soviet members who participated in a 1988-89 Antarctic expedition.
   ``After returning to Moscow, we could not accept external
disturbances. We became more sensitive to outside noises, loud
voices, cars,'' Gureva said.
   Such research could give insight into other situations where
people live in closed, isolated quarters for long periods, such as
in space and in submarines.
   ``The expedition allows us to study the human stress factor in
real circumstances,'' said Irina Solovyova, a Soviet psychologist
and cosmonaut.
   Besides the scientific goals, the women also hope to bring
attention to next year's International Antarctica Treaty signing,
which will determine if the continent will remain a world park.
   ``We are hoping that Antarctica will remain as it is, not
belonging to anyone. We hope that mining exploration there can be
kept at a level that will keep Antarctica pristine,'' Hyde said.
   Some of the participants conceded that the length and dangers of
the journey caused some stress in their families.
   Gureva said her 10-year-old daughter was at first upset by the
separation but became enthusiastic about the trip after seeing
stories about it in the Soviet press.
   ``I think it's useful for a child when their parents can fulfill
something great in their life. I think it's a great example for
them,'' Gureva said. ``As for husbands ... they are not very glad,
but I think their love does not decrease.''

   A newspaper publisher and the protege of a
former military dictator begin a duel for the presidency today
after forcing a runoff with a tight first-round race.
   It is the second presidential bid for both publisher Jorge
Carpio Nicolle and Jorge Serrano Elias, a born-again Christian and
one-time adviser to former military ruler Jose Efrain Rios Montt.
   Rios Montt was barred from Monday's election under the 1986
constitution, which bans former dictators from being president or
vice president.
   Carpio, 58, said he ``cried for joy'' when preliminary returns
showed him headed for the Jan. 6 runoff.
   ``We won because of our short, intensive campaign,'' Serrano
said.
   With 76 percent of the ballots counted late Monday, Carpio had
25.3 percent of the vote to 25 percent for Serrano, 45, who had led
earlier.
   Former Guatemala City Mayor Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen, 44, who was
strongly backed by Guatemala's hard-line conservative private
sector, had 18.5 percent and conceded defeat in the late afternoon.
   Carpio, who has been campaigning nearly nonstop for seven years,
was trounced in the runoff with President Vinicio Cerezo in 1985.
Serrano placed a distant third.
   The candidate from Cerezo's Christian Democratic Party, Alfonso
Cabrera, took 16.3 percent of the vote. Eight other candidates
shared the remainder.
   Cerezo, whose government was criticized as corrupt and weak,
offered to ``help the future president with my experience.'' The
constitution barred him from seeking re-election.
   Religion may become an issue in the runoff because Carpio is a
Roman Catholic while Serrano is a member of te U.S.-based Shaddai
Church. While Guatemala remains predominately Catholic, evangelical
churchs have attracted many followers.
   But the two men said they want to concentrate the debate on
issues afflicting Guatemala, which suffers from widespread poverty,
rampant crime and inflation running at about 60 percent a year.
   A 30-year-old guerrilla war has claimed an estimated 100,000
lives.
   Serrano, who sat on a panel that sought peace talks with leftist
rebels, apparently attracted some of the vote that would have gone
to Rios Montt, who took power after a 1982 coup and was deposed in
1983. He presided over some of the worst human rights abuses in
Guatemala's history.
   Serrano headed Rios Montt's advisory council in 1982 and 1983
and helped draft electoral laws. He later gained a more mainstream
political identity and was an important member of the National
Reconciliation Commission, created to work toward implementing the
1987 Central American accords on regional peace and
democratization.
   The winner of the runoff takes office Jan. 14, which would be
the first time in Guatemala's history that one elected civilian has
succeeded another.
   Election day was peaceful, but the election season brought an
outbreak of assassinations, disappearances and death threats that
put Guatemala back on the international human rights watch list.
   The United States has poured nearly $1 billion in aid into
Guatemala since civilian rule was restored in 1985.
   Election officials say the turnout appeared to be about 60
percent of 3.3 million registered voters.
   Guatemalans also voted for a vice president, 116 members of a
new Congress, 20 delegates to a new Central American parliament and
300 mayors.

   Marinade the chicken for up to five days in
olive oil and herbs. Or cook the bird in a tiny spa consisting of a
plastic bag.
   Voila! That bane of banquet dining, the rubber chicken,
disappears.
   Seven of the city's top hotel chefs gathered Monday in the
semi-serious Best Banquet Chicken cook-off to drum up business in
this major convention site and maybe improve the reputation of
hotel catering, whose predictably elastic fare gave rise to the
term ``rubber chicken circuit'' for the campaign trail.
   ``None of these dishes are anything close to what you'd call
rubber chicken,'' sniffed John Skaggs, top chef at the Nikko Hotel.
He won the general category award for his sesame seed chicken and
grilled chicken with white bean relish.
   The chefs agreed that the secret to non-rubbery chicken is to
make sure the bird doesn't lose moisture and isn't cooked too
quickly or too long.
   Todd Lough, an assistant chef at the Stanford Court hotel,
marinates the chicken for four or five days in olive oil and herbs.
``We go out of our way to make it flavorful because a lot of times
chicken isn't served the way it should be,'' he said.
   Dave Thompson, executive banquet chef at the Marriott, said he
cooks his Spa Chicken in a plastic bag to hold in the herbs and
juices.
   Thompson, whose Spa Chicken is poached with basil and bell
pepper and served with oriental noodles, admitted having served
rubber chicken before, ``buy only a few times in the past, a long
time ago.''
   ``I wouldn't dare do that now,'' he said.
   Chicken Breast Lambada, a baked boneless breast stuffed with red
and yellow peppers and splashed with a wine glaze, was the Fairmont
Hotel entry. Served with polenta and artichoke hearts, it won in
the most nutritious category.
   ``Presentation is very important,'' said Vincenzo Cucco, an
assistant chef at the Fairmont, as he diced chicken and chopped
peppers.
   Poultry has been on banquet tables, particularly at political
gatherings, since at least the early days of the Republic. George
and Martha Washington served chicken at a Mount Vernon reception
for Lafayette. Nowadays, chicken is served at an estimated 65
percent of banquet meals.
   ``Oh, I have some bad rubber chicken stories,'' said food writer
Camille Bounds, one of the event's judges. ``I went to China and
they don't waste anything there. Chicken feet were in my soup.''
   ``There's nothing wrong with serving chicken as long as it's the
best chicken,'' said W. Andrews Kirmse, vice president and general
manager of the Nikko Hotel. ``After this, hopefully, rubber chicken
will never be the same.''

   Rivals, stars, powerful friends and even former
employees who left under less than happy circumstances paid final
tribute to CBS founder William S. Paley.
   ``He was a master builder and CBS was his monument,'' said Frank
Stanton, a former CBS vice chairman who was with Paley and CBS in
the glory days of radio, then television, before he was forced to
retire in 1973.
   About 2,500 people attended memorial services at Temple Emanu-El
on Monday for Paley, who built a string of radio stations into a
broadcast empire. He died Oct. 25 at age 89.
   Guests included former President Nixon and Carl Bernstein, whose
Watergate reporting helped lead to Nixon's resignation. They and
others heard Paley hailed by former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite
and Henry Kissinger, once on opposite sides of the fence. Both are
now CBS board members.
   Kissinger, Nixon's secretary of state, called Paley ``larger
than life, a man of many paradoxes.'' He and Cronkite each recalled
Paley's efforts to protect the independence of CBS News.
   For as long as he knew Paley, the CBS chairman was ``impervious
to many appeals to intervene with CBS News,'' Kissinger said.
   ``Bill took the position that the CBS team was beyond his reach
because it was different - the best and most dedicated group of
journalists that had ever been assembled.''
   Paley, like rival network executives, came under pressure from
Nixon aides over coverage of Watergate and the Vietnam War.
   ``Perhaps he did bend a little,'' Cronkite said, without
elaborating. He said he didn't know all that went on at CBS
headquarters when there was pressure from government figures or
other sources. ``What I do know is that the integrity of CBS News
prevailed ... and I know that it happened on Bill Paley's watch.''
   Cronkite said Paley had for more than 50 years ``held
steadfast'' to a conviction that only a strong news organization
with ``a reputation for fairness and impartiality could withstand
the inevitable charges of bias and prejudice and the inevitable
attempts to corrupt.''
   ``You bet he was interested in the bottom line,'' Cronkite said.
``But he never failed to give to the news managers that which they
said they needed to set the standard for which CBS News was known
the world over.''
   The memorial came the same day CBS News said it was making a
``small number'' of job cuts - one report put them at between 30
and 40 - because of lean economic times and the costs of covering
the Persian Gulf crisis. The biggest layoffs in recent history at
CBS News - more than 200 - were made in 1987.
   Other notables at the memorial included former CBS correspondent
Daniel Schorr, ABC's Barbara Walters, CBS' Dan Rather, NBC
commentator John Chancellor, designer Oscar de la Renta, novelist
Kurt Vonnegut and ``M.A.S.H.'' star Alan Alda.
   Two former Federal Communications Commission members also
attended, Richard Wiley and Newton Minow. The latter now is a CBS
board member.
   CBS president Laurence A. Tisch was there, as was his
predecessor, Thomas Wyman. Ousted in a 1986 management shakeup,
Wyman will receive a $400,00 annual pension from CBS until he dies.
   Even the ushers were a Who's Who of the broadcast industry.
   They included CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer,
Capital Cities-ABC chairman Thomas S. Murphy and CBS Entertainment
president Jeff Sagansky.

   Striking Daily News workers published and
distributed an eight-page look-alike tabloid called Real News that
tells the unions' side of the bitter 19-day-old walkout at the
nation's third-largest metropolitan daily.
   The Daily News, meanwhile, intensified efforts to get the paper
to readers. It ran ads over the weekend for people willing to
distribute the paper.
   At least 100 strikers hit the windy Manhattan streets Monday to
distribute the Real News, which features columns, stories and
analyses about the strike.
   More than 1 million copies were hauled from a New Jersey plant,
said John Garcia, a striking reporter. Half were handed out Monday,
and the rest were to be distributed today, said Ed Frost, another
reporter.
   During rush hour, the strikers gave the paper away near
department stores and at train stations and major intersections.
   A cabbie asked for a stack to distribute at the taxi stand at
Kennedy Airport, and bus drivers took copies to their depots,
Garcia said.
   The 71-year-old Daily News continues to publish amid reports of
violence and intimidation of news dealers and union allegations
that the paper has hired thugs.
   As of Sunday, the police reported 151 incidents related to the
strike, with 74 arrests and four police officers injured.
   Last week, Publisher James Hoge said circulation was at 400,000
copies daily compared with pre-strike levels of 1.09 million.
   The strike by about 2,100 employees in nine unions began Oct. 25
over what the workers allege are unfair labor practices by the
newspaper.
   The Daily News has denied any unfair labor practices. The News
had been seeking greater authority over staffing at the
money-losing paper.

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Tokyo, Stocks Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed sharply lower against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo today, while share prices surged in active
trading.
   The dollar closed at 128.77 yen, down 1.73 yen from Friday's
130.50-yen finish, although it was up 0.47 yen from 128.30 yen in
New York late Monday.
   The dollar opened at 128.10 yen, the day's low, and traded as
high as 128.90 yen.
   Japan's financial markets were closed Monday for a national
holiday celebrating Emperor Akihito's enthronement.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
23,973.67, up 1,041.87 points, or 4.54 percent from Friday's
22,931.80-point finish. The index shed 38.01 points Friday.
   In bond dealings, the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds were quoted at 84.55 points, up from Friday's
close of 84.16. Their yield fell to 7.810 from 7.900 percent.
   The dollar opened lower amid speculation that U.S. interest
rates would be lowered sometime this week, dealers said, but then
it rebounded.
   ``Institutional investors bought the U.S. currency anticipating
it would firm once again before the weekend as it has in the past
several weeks,'' said Minori Takeuchi, an analyst with Chemical
Bank.
   She said the dollar's recent trend has been to rise before the
weekends on fears of growing tension in the Middle East and then
slip at the beginning of a new trading week on profit-taking.
   It gained 3.30 yen over the last three trading days of last
week.
   Japanese financial markets are highly sensitive to the Persian
Gulf situation because the country imports almost all its oil, of
which about 70 percent comes from the Middle East.
   Spot transactions totaled $9.305 billion, down from $11.876
billion Friday.
   On the stock market, share prices rallied after a four-day
decline. Dealers said the yen's recovery against the dollar and the
bullish bond market encouraged investors.
   ``Also, Tokyo traders bought after the stock market in New York
rallied Friday and Monday on hopes that the Federal Funds rate
would be lowered,`` said Kazuyuki Suzuki of Daiwa Securities.
   Lower interest rates tend to encourage stock investors to buy.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million shares,
up from Friday's 320 million shares.
   Gaining shares overwhelmed declining issues 960 to 46, with 45
others unchanged.

<HEAD>U.N. Backs Process to Fill Top Refugee Post</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. official has dismissed assertions
by the United States that it has been bypassed in the process to
fill the world body's top post for refugee programs and policies.
   Spokeswoman Nadia Younes said the United Nations leadership
``categorically denied'' that the U.S. mission was not consulted on
the nomination of India's Virendra Dayal to become high
commissioner for refugees.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar favors promoting
Dayal, his chief of staff, but a Bush administration official
complained that the choice was not discussed with Washington.
   Representatives from some Western nations - which pay the bulk
of the agency's $550 million annual budget - are seeking to have to
have their nominees considered, saying the job has traditionally
gone to a Westerner.
   U.N. sources said Perez de Cuellar would probably formally
announce Dayal to the General Assembly as his nominee even if the
Europeans and other Western nations oppose the choice.
   A U.N. statement said Perez de Cuellar ``is disturbed by
allegations of `cronyism' and the insinuation that he has not been
consulting member states,'' and described Dayal as ``eminently
qualified.''
   Dayal was a senior official in the refugee agency from 1965 to
1979.
   But the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
he was ``outraged'' at the moves to fill the post.
   The United States and other nations plan to find a mutual
Western candidate to present to Perez de Cuellar, said the
official. Canada, Britain, France, Austria, Norway and New Zealand
have all submitted nominees.
   The office of the commissioner, which is responsible for
protecting 15 million refugees, has lost two commissioners in less
than a year.
   Last week, the secretary-general's office announced that Dayal
was the only candidate being considered by the U.N. chief to
replace Thorvald Stoltenberg, who resigned two weeks ago to become
deputy prime minister of Norway.
   Stoltenberg served as high commissioner for only 11 months of
his three-year term. He had replaced Jean-Pierre Hocke of
Switzerland, who resigned in October 1989 amid allegations of
misuse of funds.
   The secretary-general nominates the commissioner, and the
General Assembly votes on the selection. Perez de Cuellar conferred
last week with the heads of the regional groups in the General
Assembly and is awaiting their reaction.
   The Western countries would be reluctant to vote against a
candidate from India, one of the major developing countries, said
U.N. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Perez de Cuellar is traveling in Japan and Europe, and will not
return to New York until about Nov. 20.
   No final nomination or decision is expected before then.

   The number of women joining
Australia's armed forces has risen sharply since May, when they
became eligible for most types of combat duty, a government
official said today.
   ``It is the case now that, in the navy, 95 per cent of
occupational categories are open to women,'' said Gordon Bilney,
the federal minister for defense, science and personnel. ``In fact,
in the navy, the only thing you can't do as a woman is go to sea in
a submarine.
   ``In the air force, the only thing you can't do is fly a combat
aircraft.''
   He said that from July to September this year, women comprised
21 per cent of all recruits to the defense forces. That was nearly
double the proportion of women already in the defense forces, he
added.
   A total of 1,537 men and 409 women joined Australia's defense
forces in the three months to the end of September of this year.
   Australia's armed forces number 67,605, including 7,894 women.

<HEAD>Iraqi Envoy Off To Morocco</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein's closest aide flew to the
Moroccan capital of Rabat today to discuss Morocco's call for an
emergency Arab summit conference to discuss a possible settlement
to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   First Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan said before his
departure that he was carrying a letter from Saddam to the Moroccan
leader, King Hassan II, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Morocco has contributed 1,700 troops to the U.S.-led
multinational force that has massed in the Saudi desert as part of
international efforts to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   At the same time, Morocco has maintained contact with the Iraqi
leadership in an effort to find a settlement that would spare the
region a destructive war.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted Ramadan as saying the letter to
Hassan deals with ``the dangers facing the Arabs as a result of the
great conspiracy which led to the intervention of American ground,
naval and air forces.''
   In response to a question about the summit call, Ramadan said
Baghdad ``supports any serious Arab effort on any level that will
serve the interests of the Arab nation ... but not a gathering for
endorsing conspiracies like the Cairo summit on which the agent
(Egyptian President) Hosni Mubarak and the traitor (Saudi King)
Fahd imposed their decisions.''
   That was a reference to the summit held in the Egyptian capital
just days after the Aug. 2 Iraqi seizure of Kuwait.
   At that gathering, Mubarak and Fahd pushed for resolutions that
supported the deployment of U.S. and allied Arab forces in Saudi
Arabia.
   Ramadan said Arab summits ``should not be forums at which the
American Pentagon's policies are translated into Arabic.''
   He repeated the three conditions Iraq has set for attending such
a meeting:
   -That Iraq is consulted in advance on the agenda.
   -That the timing and location are chosen so that Saddam will be
able to attend.
   -That the agenda include not only the Persian Gulf crisis but
all Middle East issues including the Palestine question.

<HEAD>Pact to Increase U.S. Military Access to Singapore Bases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. armed forces will have expanded use of
military bases in Singapore under an agreement signed today after
two years of negotiations.
   The new arrangement comes as U.S. and Philippine officials
negotiate the future of six American bases that have long been the
Pentagon's anchor in Southeast Asia. The bases' leases expire next
year.
   ``The agreement will permit the enhanced use of facilities for
American ships and aircraft and will facilitate a robust U.S.
presence in the Pacific,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said at the
signing ceremony in Tokyo.
   The accord was also signed by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew, who leaves office next month.
   Quayle and Lee were in Tokyo for the enthronement of Emperor
Akihito.
   Under the pact, the Air Force will be permitted to send aircraft
to Singapore several times each year on training deployments of
several weeks each, a U.S. Embassy statement said.
   More U.S. Navy vessels will also visit the tiny island-nation
about 1,450 miles southwest of the Philippine capital of Manila.
   About 95 Navy and Air Force personnel will be assigned to
Singapore year-round, and about 75 Air Force personnel will rotate
through Singapore on each training deployment, the statement said.
   The statement said the increase will start in the next three to
six months at Paya Lebar Airport and the port at Sembawang.
   ``I think the agreement shows the determination of the United
States to retain a presence in Asia ... (as a) key to economic and
political stability in this region,'' said a U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity at a briefing.
   He said improvements Singapore agreed to make to the port would
be minor: ``This is not the creation of a new base.''
   The official stressed that the agreement is not intended to
substitute for the continued use of the Philippine bases, which are
among the United State's oldest and largest on foreign soil.
   Some Philippine officials have demanded complete withdrawal of
U.S. military presence.
   Lee said negotiations for expanded use of Singapore's bases
began after a meeting with Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., two years
ago.
   ``I told him that ... we could do it if it would make it easier
for the Philippines - if it were seen that we would share the
(defense) burden.''
   In Singapore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the two
governments believe the agreement ``represents a contribution to
continuing stability in a region which has been able to achieve
very high economic growth for many years.''
   Paya Lebar, formerly the country's international airport, was
converted to military use in 1981. The Sembawang area was a
dockyard in British colonial days.
   U.S. Navy ships have visited Singapore for more than 25 years
for maintenance, supplies and crew shore leave.

   Eve Arden, who delivered zingers in a crisp,
sophisticated voice on stage, in the movies and as the star of
television's ``Our Miss Brooks'' in the 1950s, has died of heart
failure at age 82.
   The comic actress, who had cancer and heart problems and died at
home Monday, received an Oscar nomination for the classic film
``Mildred Pierce'' but was probably best known as the saucy English
teacher on ``Our Miss Brooks.''
   Born Eunice Quedens, Miss Arden was the daughter of a stage
actress and first acted on a grammar school stage at age 7. She
changed her name about 1934 after seeing the names ``Evening in
Paris'' and ``Elizabeth Arden'' on cosmetics labels.
   She made a career out of a role she often said she didn't much
like - the best friend who brightened the dramatics with deadpan
humor.
   ``She had a great sense of humor,'' said Bob Hope, who got his
break in films after he sang a love song to Miss Arden in the
Ziegfeld Follies in 1936. ``I just loved her. She had that kind of
sarcastic delivery.''
   ``She established a character I do not think will ever be
duplicated,'' said Milton Berle, who also appeared with Miss Arden
and Hope in the Follies.
   ``Our Miss Brooks'' started first on CBS radio in 1947 and moved
to television in 1952, running for four seasons. Connie Brooks was
an extension of the wisecracking but delightful characters she had
played in films for years.
   ``I've never cared for the character I generally played in
films,'' she once said. ``I certainly don't think it was me. I
really think I'm kinder than that. My friends will tell you that
I'm a very mild person.''
   ``The Eve Arden'' show followed, but lasted only a season. She
then appeared in ``The Mothers-in-Law'' with Kaye Ballard in
1967-69.
   Miss Arden was propelled to stardom with the 1937 film ``Stage
Door,'' in which she took a relatively minor role and nearly stole
the show from Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers and Lucille Ball.
   Her next big film role came as Joan Crawford's friend in the
1945 movie ``Mildred Pierce,'' which earned Miss Arden an Academy
Award nomination for best supporting actress.
   In the film, Miss Arden's character says of Miss Crawford's
character's horrible daughter: ``Veda's convinced me that
alligators have the right idea: They eat their young.''
   Miss Arden played on Broadway with Danny Kaye in ``Let's Face
It'' and in such hits as ``Very Warm for May'' and ``Two for the
Show.''
   Later, she made appearances in Steven Spielberg's TV series
``Amazing Stories'' and on ``Faerie Tale Theater,'' as well as the
films ``Grease'' and ``Grease 2.''
   Her husband of 35 years, Brooks West, died in 1984. They had
starred together in plays, musicals and the 1959 film ``Anatomy of
a Murder.''
   Survivors include four children.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Soldier Shot To Death by Infiltrator; Two Stabbed In Jerusalem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli reserve soldier was shot to death
today by a man who infiltrated from Jordan, and a Palestinian man
stabbed two paramilitary border policemen in Jerusalem's old,
walled city, authorities said.
   The fatal wounding of reserve Staff Sgt. Pinchas Levy, 37,
occurred at about 2 a.m. near Adam's Bridge, a crossing point north
of the town of Jericho that links the occupied West Bank to Jordan
   He was the second soldier slain in the area in a week.
   The policemen stabbed in Jerusalem were both slightly wounded,
police spokesman Aharon Elhayani said.
   It was the latest in a series of stabbing attacks in Jerusalem
since the Oct. 8 Temple Mount shootings, in which police opened
fire on Palestinian stone-throwers, killing 20 Arabs and wounding
140.
   A police spokesman said today that one of the Israeli police
officials criticized for his handling of the Temple Mount riots has
been promoted in rank and given a new administrative post.
   The official, Assistant Inspector General Arye Bibi, has been
promoted to full inspector general and will become chief of
personnel at national headquarters, said spokesman Ron Ishayahu.
   He had been in charge of the Jerusalem area.
   The move follows reports Bibi would be shunted aside for his
handling of the Temple Mount situation. The English-language
Jerusalem Post said Bibi had turned down an offer to be
second-in-command in Tel Aviv and threatened to quit the force
before he was given the post at national headquarters.
   A government investigation into the Temple Mount killings
concluded earlier this month that police were justified in firing
live ammunition.
   But it criticized police commanders, including Bibi, for failing
to anticipate trouble and for not being on the Mount when rioting
broke out.
   The army said in a statement that Levy, of the Jewish settlement
of Givon in the West Bank, was killed by a man in civilian clothes
who opened fire with a pistol. It said the attacker was captured
and was being interrogated.
   Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai told army radio that the
attacker was a 17-year-old Jordanian. He said the man was sent by
the Moslem fundamentalist Islamic Jihad movement and the PLO's
Fatah faction.
   Israel radio said it was the seventh infiltration from Jordan
this year.
   On Thursday, an Israeli army captain and a Jordanian guerrilla
were killed in a firefight after five Jordanians infiltrated into
the same area. Four of the infiltrators were said to be Jordanian
police.
   Army officers said they believed the five infiltrators planned
an attack in Jerusalem to avenge the Temple Mount incident.
   On Monday, the army said three Jordanian teen-agers armed with
knives were captured three weeks ago after they infiltrated into
Israeli-occupied territory. News reports said they also planned a
revenge attack for the Temple Mount killings.
   The army did not say why the incident was not disclosed earlier.
   The attack in Jerusalem's old city occurred near an apartment
owned by Israel's housing minister, Ariel Sharon. The minister was
not believed to be home at the time, police said.
   One of the policemen was stabbed in the neck, the other suffered
a hand wound when he grappled with the assailant, border police
commander Yossi Tovias said.
   The policemen were not wearing flak jackets, which have been
issued to many police as protection from the current wave of
stabbing attacks, because they were inspecting police posts, Tovias
said.
   Tovias identified the attacker as ``a local,'' a phrase usually
used to describe a Palestinian.
   Israel radio said the attacker was believed to be an Arab in his
early 20s. It quoted police as saying he was dressed in white and
wielded a newly purchased kitchen knife.
   Police spokesman Aharon Elhayani said ``dozens'' of Palestinians
were detained for questioning.
   Police closed the gates to the Old City, but later reopened
them, witnesses said. They also ordered Arabs street venders to
leave the area.
   On Saturday, a policeman was stabbed in the back by an Arab
youth on a street near the Old City. He later underwent surgery for
repair of damage to his heart and a major artery.
   Last Thursday, an Arab youth was wounded after he tried to grab
a rifle from an Israeli trooper.

<HEAD>Arizona Governor May Call Special Lame-Duck Session on King
Holiday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford may call a special session of
the lame-duck Legislature to adopt a Martin Luther King holiday,
her spokeswoman says.
   Mrs. Mofford believes some outgoing lawmakers now may be willing
to support the holiday because they won't have to face voters'
wrath, spokesman Vada Manager said Monday.
   Lawmakers have also seen the economic damage of not having a
King holiday, she said.
   ``There is now a domino effect of lost tourism, lost conventions
and a lost Super Bowl,'' Manager said. ``We're taking a beating
nationally image-wise.''
   Two King measures were defeated in last week's elections. Since
then, groups have canceled visits, the NFL may take away the 1993
Super Bowl and Notre Dame and Virginia have turned down invitations
to this year's Fiesta Bowl in Tempe.
   Manager said the Democratic governor may call a special session
if she is assured lawmakers will pass a paid King holiday by
two-thirds vote, thereby blocking any chance at another public
referendum. Supporters of a paid King holiday havenever had
support from two-thirds of the Legislature before.
   Of the 90 state lawmakers, 23 are lame ducks - seven of whom
were defeated and 16 of whom chose not to run.
   Arizona law gives voters the right to gather signatures and
demand a referendum on most bills that clear the Legislature. The
Legislature can take way that right if 20 members of the 30-member
Senate and 40 members of the 60-member House agree it is an
emergency measure.
   A group of King Day opponents calling themselves the No-No
Committee threatened recall campaigns against any lawmaker who
votes against giving the public the final say.
   ``Anything short of a vote by the people is immoral and
illegal,'' committee chairman Bob Rose said.

authorities cleared out three occupied houses in eastern Berlin.
   The protesters, many wearing black hoods, shoved cars and huge
metal trash bins into the middle of streets to act as barricades.
   Others smashed glass windows in shops and set cars on fire in
the Friedrichshain neighborhood, formerly part of East Berlin.
   An estimated 1,400 police responded with clubs, tear gas and
truck-mounted water cannons in an attempt to disperse the 500
protesters, who continued the street battles for several hours.
   Twenty of the militants were arrested and 160 police officers
were injured, authorities said. The number of injured squatters was
not known.
   The militant squatters had taken over a strip of 12 abandoned
buildings on Mainzer Street in recent months.
   As more people pack into Berlin with the recent changes in
Germany and Eastern Europe, there has been increasing need for
affordable housing. Many apartments are now financially out of
reach for ordinary workers and students.
   Early today, city spokesman Werner Thronicker described the
clashes as ``extremely serious'' and said the aarchists were
``very aggressive.''
   Thick smoke from tear gas rose from Mainzer Street. Punk rock
music blared from windows of buildings, which were covered with the
black-and-red flags of Berlin's anarchist movement and slogans and
signs denouncing German unity.
   Radicals stood on rooftops, leaned out windows and ran down the
narrow street, firing flare guns and throwing rocks and debris at
cordons of police.
   The battle spilled onto an adjoining six-lane thoroughfare,
paralyzing much of the rush-hour traffic on the east side of the
city. Stunned eastern Berlin commuters coming home from work
watched the daytime melee.

   Six young men were arrested
in two bombings and a fire at an Air Force base that apparently
were acts of retaliation, not terrorism, authorities said.
   Some of those arrested Monday had been targets of previous Air
Force investigations, FBI and Air Force officials said. They
wouldn't elaborate.
   Nobody was injured in the bombings early Sunday that damaged two
unoccupied government-owned cars and a fire that scorched the walls
of a building housing the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations.
   One of those arrested was Airman Steven Hawkins, 19, based at
McChord, said Jon Eyer, assistant agent in charge of the FBI's
Seattle office. He said Hawkins was charged with crimes on a
government reservation and held at Fort Lewis Army base.
   The other five arrested were civilians, all from the Tacoma
suburb of Lakewood. Arch Drummond Jr., 20, Michael Drummond, 18,
Louis Baldassari, 19, Brian Cotten, 19, and Michael LeVasseur, 20,
were booked into the county jail in Tacoma, also charged with
crimes on a government reservation.
   A preliminary hearing for the civilians was set for today before
a U.S. magistrate in Seattle. Hawkins will remain in Air Force
custody, Air Force special agent Ronald Pearlman and William Gore,
FBI special agent in charge, said in a statement.
   ``It is clear from the investigation that this was not a
terrorist act but allegedly one of retaliation'' against the
investigations office, the statement said. ``Some of the
individuals arrested and possibly others associated with them have
been the object of (Air Force) investigations in the past.''
   Sgt. Randy Mitchell at McChord said Monday night the arrested
men had refused to answer questions about the bombings and fire.
   The Air Force Special Investigations office handles cases
involving security problems and crimes or threats of crimes above
the level of simple drunkenness or fighting. ``They're sort of the
FBI for the Air Force,'' Master Sgt. Gloria Rayford said Sunday.
   McChord has 4,800 active-duty personnel and 1,300 to 1,500
civilians.

   The dollar fell slightly in moderate European
trading early today, with currency dealers expecting it to remain
at the current levels throughout the day.
   Gold rose slightly.
   ``The dollar is looking very soft due to the strength of the
Deutsche mark, and I expect it to stay this way all week,'' one
trader in Milan said.
   The dollar is under pressure by the rise of the mark following a
recent hike in Germany's bank rate and expectations of continued
tight German monetary policy.
   The market's expectation that interest rates will continue to
ease in the United States has further undermined the dollar,
traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.73 yen to a closing 128.77 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 129.18 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   -1.4790 German marks, down from 1.4805
   -1.2505 Swiss francs, up from 1.2500
   -4.9707 French francs, down from 4.9755

   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9655, compared
with $1.9627 late Monday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$383.35 per ounce at midmorning, up from $382.25 bid per ounce late
Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $383.15, up from $381.00 late

   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $383.61,
unchanged from Monday.

   The strongest typhoon to hit the
Philippines this year swept across central islands today with 125
mph winds, killing at least one person, sinking numerous ships and
forcing thousands to flee their homes.
   The navy said a merchant ship with 16 crew members was missing
off Mindanao island and that 16 boats had sunk off Cebu island.
Three sailors were reported missing in the Cebu sinkings.
   At least 17 people, including six Americans, were trapped on an
oil rig off Palawan island after 68 other workers were evacuated,
said Maj. Antonio Babijes, chief of the Manila Rescue Coordinating
Center.
   He said officials asked U.S. Air Force and Navy authorities to
assist in evacuating the rig after a rescue boat was forced back by
rough seas. The rig is operated by Alcorn Production-Philippines
Inc.
   The confirmed death occurred in the Panay island province of
Capiz when a tree fell on a 10-year-old boy, a spokeswoman for the
governor said.
   Typhoon Mike made landfall on Leyte island eary today and was by
midday centered over Iloilo City on Panay island, about 290 miles
southeast of Manila, the capital's weather bureau said.
   Senior forecaster Daniel Dimagiba said the storm's maximum
sustained winds had weakened to 103 mph and that it was moving at
19 mph west-northwest after crossing Leyte, Cebu and Negros and
hitting Panay islands.
   Cmdr. Ruben Lista, spokesman of the Philippine navy, said a
distress call was received from the cargo ship Dona Roberta early
today.
   The call said the ship was taking in water about 500 miles south
of Manila, Lista said. It was the last radio contact with the ship,
which was presumed to have sank, he added.
   In Cebu, Lista said, 16 vessels sank off the Cebu docks and six
others ran aground.
   He said huge waves pushed a passenger ship into a navy patrol
craft and another domestic ferry, sinking the three vessels. He
said there were no reports if the vessels were had passengers at
the time.
   Three navy utility crafts also sank nearby and three sailors
were reported missing in two of the vessels, he added.
   On Negros island, a spokeswoman from the office of the governor
of Negros Occidental province said about 9,500 people were forced
to flee their homes in six towns. Officials said nearly 200 houses
had been destroyed or damaged.
   The seas were dangerous to all types of vessels. Philippine
Airlines canceled 59 domestic flights, but international flights
were unaffected.
   The typhoon is the 14th to hit the Philippines this year. About
20 typhoons hit the country yearly.
   It was the strongest typhoon to come ashore here this year and
the strongest to enter the country's waters since December,
Dimagiba said.
   Mike struck Palau island over the weekend, toppling trees,
devastating crops and battering buildings.

<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando's daughter, under pressure
to testify at her half-brother's murder trial, tried to hang
herself over the weekend but was saved by her mother, a family
spokesman said.
   Cheyenne Brando was recovering but remained on a respirator
after her second suicide attempt in 10 days, the spokesman, Daniel
Pardon, said Monday.
   The 20-year-old was found at dawn Sunday by her mother, former
actress Tarita Teriipaia, several minutes after trying to hang
herself in her room at the family compound 6 miles west of Papeete.
   She was taken to Mamao of Papeete hospital, no longer breathing
but still maintaining a heart beat, Pardon said.
   Cheyenne regained consciousness late Sunday afternoon, he said.
   Brando, interviewed Sunday by the Los Angeles Times, said his
daughter was expected to live.
   ``We don't know if there's been brain damage or not,'' today's
editions of the newspaper quoted him as saying. Brando said his
daughter is severely depressed over U.S. prosecutors' efforts to
obtain her extradition.
   On Nov. 1, Miss Brando took an overdose of tranquilizers and
anti-depressent drugs and was hospitalized in a coma.
   Los Angeles County prosecutors want her to testify at the trial
of her half-brother, Christian Brando, who is accused of murdering
her boyfriend, Dag Drollet.
   Miss Brando fled to Tahiti a month after the May 16 shooting at
her father's California hilltop estate, and bore Drollet's child.
   A California appeals court on Nov. 5 delayed the trial
indefinitely while it reviewed Miss Brando's condition.
   French authorities have barred her from leaving the colony for
investigation pending their ruling on the U.S. extradition request.
   She is refusing to return to California.
   Prosecutors have said they can't win the case without her
testimony.
   Brando said he wanted to be with his daughter, whom he called
``the most precious thing in the world to me.'' But he said he
worried he could be detained in Tahiti for questioning in Drollet's
murder and forced to miss his son's trial, where he is expected to
testify.
   ``The judge ... is going to arrest me,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``They would detain me by taking my passport, and I'm stuck
in Tahiti .... I could be there for a year.''
   Cheyenne's mother starred with Brando in the film ``Mutiny on
the Bounty.'' Her half-brother Miko, son of Brando and Mexican
Movita Castenada, arrived in Tahiti late Friday but was not at the
family compound at the time of the incident.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Says Gorbachev Has Agreed to Division of Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian republic
said today that Mikhail S. Gorbachev has agreed to divide authority
between their rival governments, a major step toward ending the
nationwide paralysis of power.
   The agreement appeared to mark a major concession by tahe Soviet
president, who has not yet commented publicly on his five-hour
meeting Sunday with Yeltsin, his political arch-rival.
   ``Russia has chosen its path and is on its way,'' Yeltsin told
Russia's parliament today in the most detailed account yet of
Sunday's session.
   The two men have appointed commissions that are discussing how
the two governments should divide such fundamental responsibilities
as foreign affairs, national security, taxation, banking and
currency, Yeltsin said.
   The commissions' decisions would redefine the very basis of
power in the Soviet Union. The vast Russian republic is home to
half the Soviet Union's 287 million people and comprises two-thirds
of its territory.
   Yeltsin said he had proposed to Gorbachev ``a new system of
state power: the formation of a coalition government of national
unity in which the candidates for several posts would be proposed
by the Russian parliament.''
   The Russian president was greeted with laughter and applause in
the chamber when he added that he ``did not ask for many posts,
just three, prime minister, defense and finances,'' jobs which form
the crux of Soviet power.
   The nation has undergone a crisis of authority since a
declaration of sovereignty last June by the Russian republic, which
has the lion's share of the nation's natural resources and wealth.
   The result has been a series of conflicting laws and decrees
issued by Yeltsin and Gorbachev and the national and Russian
parliaments that have virtually paralyzed commerce across the
country, worsening the already dire shortages of food and other
consumer goods.
   ``We are starting the process that should have started after we
passed our declaration'' of Russian sovereignty in June, Yeltsin
said.
   He said he told the Soviet president that the crisis was caused
because ``you are conducting a policy of diktat from the center,''
in violation of the old Soviet constitution and violation of recent
agreements between the two men.
   ``You did not officially recognize the division of functions
between the center and Russia,'' Yeltsin said.
   ``The same happened with the economic program, that is,
everything is coming from the center,'' with Gorbachev unwilling to
share power with the national and Russian parliaments, Yeltsin told
the lawmakers.
   Late in the summer, the two men agreed to work together to
implement a program to transform the Soviet Union from a centrally
planned to a market economy within 500 days.
   But Gorbachev balked under pressure from conservatives, and
persuaded the national legislature to grant him sweeping powers to
implement a far more modest reform program.
   His program skirts such crucial issues as whether to break up
collective farms, and Gorbachev has called for a national
referendum to decide whether to allow private ownership of land.
   Since Nov. 1, Yeltsin and his government have gone ahead with
their own more radical 500-day program, although they have been
stymied because the republic does not have clear control of prices,
currency, interest rates, land and real estate.
   Yeltsin said he and Gorbachev agreed that the commissions would
work in parallel with negotiations on a new union treaty, which
Gorbachev is pushing to replace a 1924 document that formed
republics into the Soviet Union.
   All but one of the current 15 Soviet republics has declared some
form of independence or sovereignty, and Gorbachev has been
increasingly powerless to enforce his will on the country.
   Yeltsin said that in the meeting, Gorbachev ``insisted on
rushing quickly through'' completion of a union treaty, ``and that
Russia should play a great consolidating role in the process of
signing a new union treaty.
   But Yeltsin said he insisted that Gorbachev respect the
sovereignty of the Russian republic and sign such a treaty only
after the central government and republics had carefully defined
their powers.

<TEXT>
   State Treasurer George Wallace Jr., heir
to Alabama's most prominent political dynasty, said he'll retire
from politics at the end of his upcoming term because of its affect
on his family.
   Wallace, 39, who ran unopposed and was re-elected last week to a
four-year term, said Monday he will not try to follow his parents
into the governor's office.
   ``I think I'm leaving it permanently,'' Wallace said in a
telephone intervew. ``There are things in life more important than
politics. I think maybe I've learned that the hard way when you see
how it affects people closest to you.''
   After leaving office in 1994, Wallace said he would like to
devote more time to his hobby of writing and would consider
returning to academic life.
   ``The basic reason and the major reason is I have seen how it
can affect your family,'' he said. ``Most people in political life
tend to focus on politics and it takes you away from your family
and those closest to you.''
   His father, four-term Gov. George C. Wallace survived an
assassin's bullet in 1972 but was left paralyzed and confined to a
wheelchair. His mother, the late Lurleen Wallace, also was
governor.
   There had been speculation that Wallace would seek the
governorship in four years.
   Wallace said he had not discussed his decision with his
71-year-old father and did not know how he would react.
   ``It's a decision I reached inside myself,'' he said.
   Wallace's father indicated after his third term as governor that
he was probably through with politics. But after four years out of
the spotlight, he returned and won a fourth term in 1982.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Confirms French Role in Cold War Resistance Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister has confirmed that France was
involved in a secret Cold War project to prepare underground
resistance in the event of a Soviet takeover of Western Europe.
   A Paris newspaper, Liberation, reported today that the French
network was formally dissolved only after recent disclosures of a
similar operation in Italy created a political controversy.
However, the paper said the French network had been in a state of
``clinical death'' for many years.
   The defense minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, said on Monday
that the network was established in the early 1950s to plan for
liaisons between a government-in-exile and an underground
resistance in the event that France was occupied by East Bloc
forces.
   He said the network was dissolved on presidential orders, but
declined to specify when the order was issued. For most of its
existence, the network was ``dormant,'' Chevenement said.
   Officials in Italy, Belgium and Greece have confirmed the
existence of similar networks in their countries. They reportedly
were coordinated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
funded at least in part by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
   Liberation said the overall network was known as the Allied
Coordination Committee. The paper said France engaged in liaisons
with the other participating countries but did not go so far as to
organize secret arms caches.
   Under the French plan, several dozen people - not known to each
other - were recruited by the intelligence service to serve as
liaisons between local authorities and exiled leaders in the event
of a takeover.

   Rain dampened the Northwest today and the Northeast shivered as
early morning temperatures dipped into the 20s. Unseasonably warm
weather was expected today from the Pacific Coast into the middle
Mississippi Valley.
   High temperature records were broken or tied in numerous cities
Monday. Records were set in Billings, Mont., 71; Grand Island,
Neb., 72; Lewiston, Idaho, 66; Reno, Nev., 73; Sacramento, Calif.,
78; and San Francisco, 80.
   A Pacific weather system moved into Washington state during the
night along with rain and gusty winds. Strong winds along the east
slopes of the Cascades produced gusts to 31 mph at Yakama.
   Rivers in Washington which flooded during the weekend were not
expected to reach flood stage again.
   A nearly stationary front extended across western Missouri and
eastern Nebraska into the western Dakotas. This system was expected
to move east as a warm front today, bringing above normal
temperatures and a mostly clear sky to the region through midweek.
   In New England, windy and cold weather was expected to continue
today. Periods of snow and flurries were forecast for northern
Maine and along the border into northern Vermont.
   Northeast Vermont picked up some snow overnight as did the
southern tier region of New York in lake effect snow squalls.
   High temperature for the nation today was 96 at San Bernardino,
Calif.

   The countdown toward Thursday's
liftoff of Atlantis with a spy satellite proceeded smoothly despite
mounting concerns over launch day weather, NASA said today.
   The five-member, all-military crew was due to arrive at Kennedy
Space Center this afternoon from Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Atlantis blasts off sometime between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
EST in NASA's fifth night launch of a shuttle. Because the Pentagon
flight is secret, the exact time will not be announced until nine
minutes before liftoff.
   The mission is expected to last about four days, during which
the crew will deploy a satellite that reportedly will spy on Iraq.
   NASA spokesman George Diller said today the countdown, which
began Sunday night, was proceeding without trouble.
   ``Everything is great - not a hitch,'' he said.
   But Air Force meteorologists today were forecasting only a 30
percent chance of good weather at launch time - down 10 percent
from Monday's predictions. The main concern is cross winds at the
launch site, Diller said.
   Better weather conditions were expected on Friday and Saturday.
   The mission originally was scheduled for July but was delayed,
like shuttle Columbia's flight, by dangerous hydrogen leaks. The
shuttles were pronounced safe to fly after fueling tests last
month.

   A Supreme Court justice
appointed to investigate unsolved killings of anti-apartheid
activists said today he found no evidence the police or army
operated death squads.
   Government opponents who have long blamed the security forces
for the deaths of dozens of activists were certain to protest the
finding.
   In another development, police said today that seven blacks were
shot and stabbed to death in the troubled black townships outside
Johannesburg. An eighth death was reported in Wenbezi, northwest of
Durban.
   The finding on the death squads came from Supreme Court Justice
Louis Harms, the sole member of a government-appointed commission.
He described as unreliable three former policemen who said they
carried out more than 10 killings as part of authorized death
squads.
   Harms said killings described by the former policemen
``undoubtedly took place,'' but that ``it would be very difficult
in the extreme to prove the veracity of the allegations in criminal
proceedings.''
   Police and the military have denied the existence of death
squads. They said any criminal acts carried out against the
anti-apartheid camp were undertaken by individuals acting on their
own.
   Harms said there was a probability that police committed violent
crimes against members of black opposition groups such as the
African National Congress, which was legalized in February after
being outlawed for 30 years.
   But he added there was no evidence that ``a particular policeman
committed a particular crime of violence for a particular
purpose.''
   Another government commission that investigated the allegations
last year and released its findings Saturday reached the same
conclusion.
   Harms also said a covert military group, the Civil Cooperation
Bureau, had ``contaminated'' the whole security arm of the state
and there was reason to suspect it was involved ``in more crimes of
violence than the evidence shows.''
   Among the few operations the bureau admitted carrying out was
hanging a baboon fetus on the door of a home belonging to Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   Harms heard testimony from dozens of witnesses from March
through August as he examined more than 60 unsolved killings of
anti-apartheid activists. He said two 1986 slayings should be
investigated further by prosecutors but did not make such a
recommendation in any of the other killings.
   Former policeman Almond Nofomela caused the inquiries into the
alleged death squads Oct. 19, 1989, the day before he was scheduled
to be executed for a killing with no apparent political overtones.
   Nofomela said he and two former colleagues took part in many
killings and kidnappings authorized by superiors. The other two
fled the country, then said they had joined in the killings
described by Nofomela, who remains on death row.

   In the township violence, the worst fighting was in Katlehong,
southeast of Johannesburg, where police discovered five bodies this
morning with bullet and knife wounds.
   A police spokeswoman, Lt. Ida van Zweel, said the battles were
between rival Zulu and Xhosa residents of a squatter camp, who have
been fighting since Sunday. She said the bloodshed began after one
group demanded the other take part in a rent boycott.
   Authorities also found a body in Evaton and another in
Vosloorus, both south of Johannesburg.
   Meanwhile, police denied that they deliberately targeted Winnie
Mandela, wife of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, when they fired tear
gas on blacks in Atteridgeville township outside Pretoria on
Monday.
   A police spokesman, Maj. Reg Crewe, said tear gas was used to
disperse a stone-throwing crowd in the township, where police and
residents have clashed several times in recent days.
   Mrs. Mandela, who was visiting residents to show support, said:
``It is clear the attack was deliberately directed at me and my
delegation.''
   In another development, a white extremist testified he stabbed
and shot to death a black taxi driver because he needed practice
before embarking on a campaign to assassinate black leaders.
   ``It would be fatal to get cold feet if I had a leader in my
sights,'' Cornelius Lottering said Monday in the Johannesburg
Supreme Court, where he is on trial for murder.
   He has pleaded innocent, saying the killing was an act of war.
   White extremists upset by President F.W. de Klerk's political
reforms have vowed to fight rather than accept a black majority
government in South Africa.

<HEAD>Moslem Militias Complete Withdrawal From Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three main Moslem and leftist
militias announced today they have completed their withdrawal from
Beirut ahead of a government deadline to remove the forces from the
capital.
   In the Christian heartland, the Lebanese army began closing down
militia centers estabished by Syrian-backed groups, a condition set
by the main Christian militia for pulling out of Beirut.
   President Elias Hrawi, seeking to re-establish central authority
and end Lebanon's 15{-year-old civil war, has ordered all militias
out of the Beirut area by Nov. 19. The militias are responsible for
most of the 150,000 deaths in the civil war.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, said it has
withdrawn its fighters and weapons from the southern slums of the
capital, where Moslem militants once held most of the 13 Westerners
missing in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah's rival Shiite Moslem group, Amal, and the leftist
Druse Progressive Socialist Party made similar announcements.
   ``We have completed implementation of the part concerning us of
the greater Beirut plan,'' said a Hezbollah spokesman, who asked
not to be named.
   Beirut newspapers have reported that the hostages were moved out
of the capital to east Lebanon in early October, when it became
apparent that Hrawi's government was serious in ridding Beirut of
the militias.
   The 13 hostages include six Americans. The longest-held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Most of the hostages are held by underground factions linked to
Hezbollah, although the group denies any involvement.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party said
in a statement that it has pulled out of the southeastern suburbs
to the Chouf mountains southeast of the capital, while Nabih
Berri's Amal withdrew to south and east Lebanon.
   The government said its army would begin house-to-house searches
on Nov. 20 to make sure there are no militia elements remain in the
capital area.
   Hrawi's government took control after a Syrian-led assault on
Oct. 13 crushed an 11-month rebellion by Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Aoun had opposed an Arab League plan to end the civil war,
saying there was no guarantee that Syria, which had 40,000 troops
in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate, would leave.
   The peace pact includes political reforms that redistribute
power equally between Christians and Moslems. Aoun and Hrawi are
Christians.
   Christians had maintained the upper hand in government since
independence from France in 1943.

   Demands that President Bush do a better job
convincing the American people of the need for a Persian Gulf war
escalated today when the Republican former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee urged the president to clarify U.S.
aims in the region.
   ``I think the president must lay out now to the nation and the
Congress specifically what our aims are,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar
of Indiana.
   In an appearance on NBC's ``Today'' show, Lugar also urged Bush
to call a special session of Congress to debate the issues involved
in the U.S. confrontation with Iraq ``and vote - affirmatively I
would prsume - so that we have authorization for what is
required.''
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who has criticized the administration's
policy in the Persian Gulf, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America''
that ``as representatives of the people we should be engaged in the
debate about the purpose of this involvement and perhaps some
suggested alternatives.''
   ``I don't think we've done a very good job in the administration
of explaining to the American people in depth what this is all
about,'' said Lance Tarrance, a Republican pollster based in Texas.
   ``We learned from Vietnam that Americans have to be convinced
and sold on a rationale for our involvement,'' said Neil Newhouse,
a pollster with the Republican firm headed by Richard Wirthlin.
   War worries swept Washington the past week after Bush announced
a substantial increase in the U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf. The announcement also triggered speculation on the impact
that hostilities would have on the 1992 presidential election.
   Public support for Bush's handling of the gulf crisis has fallen
from 82 percent in late August to 51 percent this week, according
to a poll published today by ``USA Today.''
   The telphone poll Monday of 615 adults also showed that only 51
percent approved of Bush's decision last week to send 200,000 more
U.S. troops to the region, while 38 percent said they disapproved,
the newspaper said.
   The poll, by Gordon S. Black, had a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percent, meaning that if every adult in the country were
surveyed, the results would not differ more than 4 percentage
points either way.
   During the final days of this year's campaign, Bush stepped up
his attacks on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and was widely
credited by politicians with shifting the focus of the debate from
domestic issues that were hurting Republican candidates.
   Would a war guarantee Bush's re-election? Most analysts said
hostilities contained more political dangers than benefits for him.
   ``Don't overestimate the patience of the American people and
don't underestimate the expectations,'' said Newhouse. He added
that most Americans expect a war with Iraq would be won as quickly
as the actions against Grenada and Panama, which ended within days.
   ``I think that's going to be the wild card in this next
presidential election,'' said John White, a former Democratic Party
chairman. ``If we have a war, if there are high casualties, it will
be a referendum on George Bush.''
   White predicted that in the event of war, the Democrats would
have to nominate for president in 1992 ``someone who warned or
tried to prevent this thing from happening.''
   Democrats who fit that description are beginning to emerge,
among them Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   Nunn said Sunday that ``the last thing we need is to have a war
over there, a bloody war, and have American boys being sent and
brought back in body bags and yet not have the American people
behind them.''
   Nunn frequently is mentioned as a likely contender for the 1992
Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``We can say here's what we think will happen, or here's how the
American people will react,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
``Nobody can know. You don't know how you would react; I don't know
how I would react.''
   The one area on which all analysts agreed was the need for the
president to explain more compellingly the need for Americans to
fight and die in the Middle East.
   Conservative David Keene said the impact of a war on the 1992
elections would ``depend on how the war goes and how well the
president is able to articulate his reasons for taking that step. I
think the public will support a winning military effort if it isn't
too costly or too long if they understand the reasons for it.
   ``The problem at this point is that we've gotten ourselves
bogged down over there for a long period of time with the president
issuing conflicting reasons and rationales for our being there,''
Keene said. Sometimes it's to deter aggression; sometimes it's
energy; sometimes it's democratic values.''
   Tarrance said, ``The politics are too complex and Americans are
too used to these complexities to buy simple naked aggression as
the only cause.''
   The Texas pollster suggested that Bush must explain that Iraqi
control of a substantial portion of the world's oil would ``bring
Western civilization to its knees ... and somebody better start
describing what that means.''
   ``People look toward the president today as an explainer of
events,'' he said.

<HEAD>Musical About Relationships Opens off-Broadway</HEAD>

   In ``Catch Me if I Fall,'' which has book, music
and lyrics by Barbara Schottenfeld, the title song explains what
the five main characters want in a loved one.
   But only Laura Dean, as a young woman from Romania, continually
breaks through the brittle surface of this musical about New York
relationships to give the cynical, hip, amusing, deliberately
shallow show warmth, emotional feeling and depth.
   ``Catch Me if I Fall'' opened Monday night at off-Broadway's
Promenade Theater.
   The plot ostensibly centers around Lonny, turning 40, who quit
sculpting to work for a corporate headhunter. James Judy, as Lonny,
doesn't look like a ladies' man but he and ex-wife Laurie (Jeanine
Morick) still have a yen for each other. He lives with Godiva
(Ronnie Farer), a veterinarian who concentrates more on her career
than on him.
   And he marries - in name only - Domnica (Laura Dean), the
Romanian girlfriend of his boss, Peter (Sal Viviano), because her
visitors' permit is about to expire and Peter's divorce isn't
final.
   One of the musical's high points is Peter's crass and loving
song, ``The Beach House,'' which he's determined not to give up in
the divorce settlement.
   But the focus of the musical is really on Domnica. Everybody
else's problems are the stuff of musical comedy. The ex-wife, told
her neurotic self is talking, cracks, ``My neurotic self is the
real me.'' Her small son (David Burdick) has a smart mouth. The
vet's beeper calls her, in the middle of a kiss, to a pregnant
poodle.
   Schottenfeld's lyrics are literate and clever. Musically, she
has been listening to Stephen Sondheim ballads. Her best melodies
are ``Home Never Leaves You'' and ``Isn't It Strange (That We Can
Love Again).''
   Susan Einhorn directed. G.W. Mercier designed costumes and sets,
some inside slide-away cylindrical walls for quick changes. The
Never or Now Company produced in association with Frederick Schultz
and Terry A. Johnston.
   Schottenfeld currently is writing lyrics for Jule Styne's
upcoming Broadway musical, ``The Red Shoes.''

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading radical lawmaker in Iran was
quoted today as saying British hostages held in Lebanon will be
freed within a few days.
   Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a former interior minister who reportedly
has close links to fundamentalists in Lebanon, said the releases
will come over his objections. He acknowledged that pro-Iranian
militants holding the hostages were under increasing pressure by
unspecified Lebanese Moslem groups.
   ``I can only express my regret,'' the parliamentarian told the
Iranian newspaper Abrar in response to a question about the four
British hostages.
   ``We see that the British hostges are due to be released within
the next few days due to the pressures on Lebanese Moslem groups.''
   Friends and relatives of the British hostages reacted
cautiously.
   ``It looks like a very good piece of news, but unfortunately we
have heard many comments like it before, though not, as far as I
know, from Mr. Mohtashemi,'' said Catherine Comerford, a member of
a support group for hostage John McCarthy.
   ``My reaction is understandably cautious after all that we have
heard before,'' said David Waite, brother of Anglican envoy Terry
Waite, who disappeared in Beirut in 1987.
   The other British hostages are writer Alec Collett and former
pilot Jack Mann.
   The British Foreign Office said it did not have any information
to substantiate the Mohtashemi report.
   Knowledgeable sources in the Middle East who follow the hostage
issue closely said there was nothing to indicate a hostage release
was imminent.
   The sources, insisting that they not be identified further, said
Mohtashemi's remarks may be aimed at increasing pressure on Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani to seek word on Iranians missing in
Lebanon.
   Mohtashemi did not further specify where the pressures to free
the four Britons were coming from. But in the course of the
interview, he complained about a Syrian-backed plan to pacify
Lebanon and disband militias there.
   Pressures to free the hostages could also be coming from
Mohtashemi's Iranian rivals, led by Rafsanjani, who reportedly are
seeking to end the ordeal of hostages in Lebanon to improve his
country's relations with the West.
   Mohtashemi did not comment on the fate of the nine other Western
captives in Lebanon, including six Americans.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985 in Beirut.
   Mohtashemi said five Iranians have been held by Christian
militiamen in Lebanon since 1982. It was the first time that an
Iranian official has spoken of five Iranians.
   Earlier, Rafsanjani's government had offered to help free
Western captives in return for information about four Iranians who
were kidnapped in 1982 by Christian militiamen in north Lebanon.
   Mohtashemi identified the fifth as an Alim, or a Moslem scholar.
He only provided his second name as Tavassoli and said he
disappeared during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   Lebanese sources say the Iranians are dead. But Iranian
officials have said in the past that they have information four are
alive.
   Most of the Western captives in Lebanon are believed held by
pro-Iranian extremists, operating under the Hezbollah Shiite Moslem
group.
   There had been speculation at least one British hostage would be
freed after the resumption of London-Tehran relations last month.
   But these hopes dimmed after a Syrian government newspaper,
Tishrin, wrote that no hostage will be freed from Lebanon until
London restores ties with Damascus. Their relations were broken in
1986.

   Right after the fraternity party the
young woman could remember it all so clearly: A pledge had raped
her as several others watched, she told police.
   A week and a half later her memory failed. But by then, one
youth who had been at the party was dying, an apparent suicide, and
another had been held without bail for a week in prison, accused of
a rape he denies committing.
   The 18-year-old woman who accused the student now says she was
drunk and testified in court that she no longer remembers
everything that happened. She has not been identified by the media
because of the nature of the case.
   ``It's just a big mess,'' said Sandra Wall, 21, who writes for
the University of Rhode Island newspaper. ``I want to hold somebody
responsible but it's a tragedy. ... There really is no answer and
there is nobody to blame.''
   Michael Lindell, 20, never a suspect in the alleged rape Oct. 27
at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house at the University of Rhode Island,
died Wednesday at a hospital after shooting himself in the head at
the house he shared with John J. Birchall, who owned the house.
   Hours earlier, Dave Lallemand, 19, who was charged with the rape
but maintained his innocence, was freed when his accuser said she
had forgotten the details.
   Pawtucket police Monday disclosed that a note was found at
Lindell's home.
   ``It was a very vague note and I would not necessarily term it a
suicide note,'' said detective Lt. Thomas Harris. He wouldn't
elaborate.
   Harris said Lindell, a former URI student who knew members of
the fraternity, knew state police wanted to question him about what
he saw at the party.
   Investigators haven't said whether they were linking his death
to the alleged rape. State Police Lt. Brian Andrews said detectives
have concluded their investigation and will present the evidence to
a grand jury.
   Neither Lallemand nor his accuser could be reached for comment
Monday. There was no answer at the woman's dorm room. Lallemand was
not at his parents' home in Westford, Mass., where he abruptly
returned on Sunday.
   ``No one knows what he's going through,'' said Michael P. Brady,
21, Tau Kappa Epsilon president.
   ``We really don't know what happened,'' said Brady, of Albany,
N.Y. ``We're not saying nothing happened. ... We can't really fit
things together.''
   The woman, an 18-year-old freshman, told police she was raped in
an upstairs bedroom at TKE in South Kingston by a man she met that
evening.
   Police interviewed her three times within hours of the incident.
She said her attacker wore a TKE pledge pin and immediately
identified the 6-foot-7 Lallemand when shown pictures of the 21
fraternity pledges, police said.
   Lallemand was charged and held at the state prison for a week
until a bail hearing Wednesday. It was then the woman testified she
had been ``very drunk'' at the party and could no longer recall
everything that had happened.
   ``Dave began touching me and, you know, I was telling him, `I'm
not that kind of girl,''' she testified. ``From then on I'm
blank.''
   The next thing she remembers, she said, was standing up from a
sofa with her pants and underwear at her knees and seeing Lallemand
and four other men.
   Two or three men ``were trying to pull my pants back down'' she
said. ``They were just laughing.''
   She said she couldn't recall other things she had told police.
   The judge refused to admit her statements to police as evidence
and dismissed the case.
   The university suspended activities at the fraternity after the
incident.
   Brady said one of TKE's 85 members had his car vandalized and
the word ``rapist'' scrawled in lipstick on his windshield.
   ``We're taking kind of a beating,'' he said. ``If the same thing
happened in a dorm it wouldn't even get in the press.''
   The 10,000-student university suspended two fraternities in
1988, one for hazing and one for possession of stolen goods.
   ``We've made so many changes and become so strict. ... I'm
surprised anything happened,'' said Lloyd Sprague, president of a
student board that oversees the university's 14 fraternities.
``It's definitely put us back a few years.''

   A killer doll named Chuckie wasn't kidding
around. His ``Child's Play 2'' carved out the top spot at the
nation's box office.
   ``Child's Play 2'' took in $10.7 million over the weekend.
   The surrealistic thriller ``Jacob's Ladder,'' about a Vietnam
vet caught in a world of dreams and visions, dropped a notch to No.
2 in its second week, bringing in $5.08 million, Exhibitor
Relations Co. reported Monday.
   The spectral romance ``Ghost'' was third with $4.3 million,
followed by Kirstie Alley in the sex-and-death farce ``Sibling
Rivalry'' with $3.02 million.

Claus von Bulow murder case.
   ``Ghost,'' the highest-grossing film of 1990, has made $186
million in 18 weeks. The sleeper hit was written by Bruce Joel
Rubin, who also wrote ``Jacob's Ladder.''
   Kevin Costner's epic tribute to Indian life, ``Dances With
Wolves,'' earned the highest per-screen average of the year,
grossing $598,257 on just 14 screens.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,

   Iraq will release four more American
hostages, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark said today
after concluding an independent peace mission to Baghdad.
   ``I was told that two were going to be released today and
apparently did not make it on the plane and that they will be out
on the next plane whenever that is,'' Clark told reporters on
arrival in Amman from Baghdad.
   ``I think it will be tomorrow and there will be two more after
that,'' said Clark, who arrived on the daily Iraqi Airways flight
from the Iraqi capital.
   Clark, a peace activist who traveled to Hanoi during the Vietnam
War, is the second prominent American to go to Baghdad since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Former presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson was there in August.
   During his three-day visit Clark criticized the United States
for not seeking a negotiated settlement to the Persian Gulf crisis
and chastised Iraq for holding foreign hostages as a ``human
shield'' against air raids by the predominantly U.S. forces
deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported that Clark had conferred
with top Iraqi officials, including President Saddam Hussein.
   Clark said he met with American hostages who have taken refuge
at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Baghdad.
   ``They want to go home. They want liberty, they want to be free.
But their physical and mental health seem excellent as far as I

   There were 3,500 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait before the
invasion. Some 600 remain in hiding or are held in Kuwait. About
330 are detained in Iraq, including 104 men held at 30 strategic
sites throughout the country.
   Many Western leaders have said independent missions to Baghdad
by former leaders could be used to split the alliance against Iraq.

<HEAD>Former Aide to Georgia Governor Fails to Kill Libel Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Perdue, onetime top aide to Georgia Gov.
Joe Frank Harris, failed today in a Supreme Court attempt to kill a
libel lawsuit against him by state Public Service Commission member
J. Mac Barber.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Barber's
allegations that Perdue falsely accused him of bribery should go to
a jury.
   The commission was the target of a bribery investigation in 1984
and 1985. Barber was never charged with a crime as a result of that
investigation, but others were indicted.
   Barber resigned from the commission in 1985 but qualified to run
in 1986 for the seat he had left 18 months previously.
   In that 1986 election, Barber lost to Gary Andrews, the man
appointed to succeed him.
   Barber regained a commission seat in elections this month.
   During the 1986 campaign, Perdue sent a letter to about 350 city
and county officials throughout the state urging them to oppose
Barber's election.
   In the letter, Perdue said, ``A Public Service Commissioner
betrayed the public trust ... by accepting what amounted to a
bribe.''
   The letter added: ``When confronted with the fact that the
attorney general and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had this
information and were about to seek a felony indictment, Mac Barber
chose to resign his office rather than face the prospect of
indictment and conviction. The trucking company official who gave
Mac Barber the money was convicted and fined a total of $12,000.''
   A state trial judge threw out Barber's suit, ruling that there
was no ``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless disregard of
falsity.
   But the Georgia Court of Appeals reinstated the suit by a 5-4
vote last year.
   ``There is undisputed evidence that (Perdue) knew that (Barber)
had not been convicted or even indicted for bribery, yet stated
that he was guilty of it,'' the state court said. ``A jury can
reasonably infer that he stated his opinion as though it were an
official fact, despite the accusation's not having been proved
beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.''
   The Georgia Supreme Court refused, 4-2, to hear Perdue's ensuing
appeal.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Perdue said the case
is not one that should reach a jury.
   They said Perdue had sat in on a meeting between the governor
and Barber before the 1985 resignation, had reviewed the GBI file
on the commission bribery investigation, discussed his letter with
the attorney general and received approval by a lawyer on the
governor's staff.
   In urging the justices to reject Perdue's appeal, lawyers for
Barber said the former governor's aide ``uttered false statements
of fact which Perdue knew to be false, or whose falsity Perdue
recklessly disregarded.''
   The case is Perdue vs. Barber, 90-502.

   Although ``Twin Peaks'' finally appeared to
reveal the killer of Laura Palmer, the show only came in second in
ratings in its time period, despite heavy advance publicity,
Nielsen estimates showed today.
   But that was the show's highest rating so far this season.
Saturday's episode, in which Palmer's father appeared to be
displaying a second personality as the killer, averaged a 10.4
rating.
   While up considerably from its 7.8 ratings average for the three
previous weeks, Saturday's episode of ``Peaks'' couldn't beat NBC's
opposing ``Carol &amp; Company'' and ``American Dreamer.''
   NBC won the hour with an 11.8 ratings average, with Carol
Burnett's anthology comedy show getting a 13.8 and ``Dreamer'' a
9.8.
   But ``Peaks'' beat CBS' ``Wiseguy'' season premiere, third with
a 6.8 average.
   Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   ABC had refused to give TV critics advance tapes of the show for
screening, a policy it has had since ``Peaks'' premiered last
season.

<HEAD>Court Turns Away Wisconsin Controversy Over Association Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away a
Wisconsin controversy over how much money associations may spend in
communicating with their members about political matters.
   The justices, without comment, left intact rulings that the
dispute is not yet ready for intervention by the courts.
   The Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC), a voluntary
organization of teachers and other public school employees, had
urged the court to rule that a state law limiting campaign spending
cannot be applied to an association's messages to its members.
   The appeal acted on today said applying the campaign-spending
limits to such communications would violate free-speech and
associational rights.
   WEAC announced in the spring of 1988 that it intended to hire
about 20 of its members to work toward mobilizing the association's
membership in support of those candidates whom WEAC planned to
endorse in the November elections.
   After learning of WEAC's intention, members of the State
Elections Board expressed concern that certain activities, if
undertaken at the request or suggestion of a candidate, might
constitute contributions to that candidate.
   Wisconsin law imposes limits on individual campaign
contributions of $1,000 per state Senate race and $500 per state
assembly race.
   The elections board met with WEAC's legislative director in July
1988, and in August sent the association a letter stating the board
planned no formal action because there was no evidence that WEAC
had violated any campaign law.
   WEAC sued the elections board in state court that September,
seeking a ruling that any expenses incurred in political
communications with its members were exempt from the spending
limits - even those incurred as a result of contact with an
endorsed candidate or that candidate's campaign committee.
   State courts, including the Wisconsin Supreme Court last June,
refused to rule on WEAC's constitutional claims. The state courts
said the claim was premature because the elections board had taken
no action.
   ``To resolve WEAC's constitutional claims would require the
court to speculate both on the nature of WEAC's conduct and on the
enforcement posture of the board with respect to that conduct,''
the state court said.
   In a dissenting opinion from the June ruling, Justice William
Bablitch said such associational expenditures ``need not be
reported and are not contributions within the meaning'' of the
Wisconsin law.
   Bablitch chastised his court for leaving WEAC leaders ``in an
untenable position'' in which they ``could forego political
activity which they believe is constitutionally protected or ...
proceed with their plans at their peril.''
   The case is Wisconsin Education Association Council vs.
Wisconsin State Elections Board, 90-492.

<TEXT>
   Leningrad's reformist mayor urged the City Council
today to ration eggs, flour, meat and other necessities, saying it
is the only way the city will get through the winter without hunger
and unrest.
   ``The entire country is introducing ration cards, and we
unfortunately cannot avoid it either,'' Mayor Anatoly Sobchak said.
   Soviet television showed shoppers in Leningrad, the country's
second-largst city, waiting in 500-yard-long lines for ordinary
items like butter, milk and chocolate.
   ``Citizens standing in queues since morning want their
representatives to take faster, and most of all, more decisive
actions,'' the television announcer said.
   A few items are already rationed in Leningrad, but the new plan,
if adopted, would be one of the most comprehensive rationing plans
in the country.
   Leningrad officials said the council was likely to make a
decision Thursday.
   Sobchak suggested that without rationing, public anger over
shortages could endanger President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political
reforms.
   ``Democracy is facing a hungry winter,'' he said. ``It is
crucial for democracy to survive this winter. The only solution I
see is to introduce ration cards now.''
   Moscow already has rationed sugar and cigarettes, limiting
residents to 4.4 pounds of sugar and 10 packs of cigarettes per
person in November.
   Moscow's City Council is expected to expand its ration system to
include meat, butter and flour starting Dec. 1. Soviet newspapers
have given varying accounts of the amounts of those items that
Moscow residents would be allowed to buy.
   Local officials in other cities have rationed meat, vodka,
butter and similar staples. In some regions, particularly in
northern Russia where supplies grow scarce in winter, limited
rationing has been in effect for years. But it is becoming more and
more widespread.
   In Leningrad, the city's 4.8 million residents already receive
monthly ration coupons for 4.4 pounds of sugar, one bottle of vodka
and two bottles of wine.
   A commission headed by Marina Salye, a prominent reformist
politician, has recommended new limits of 2.6 pounds of meat, 1.1
pounds of chicken, and 2.2 pounds of sausage.
   In addition, each resident would be allotted 10 eggs, 1.1 pounds
of butter, 2.2 pounds of cereal or pasta, 1.1 pounds of flour and
two-thirds of a pound of vegetable oil. Leningrad residents also
would receive monthly coupons for five packs of cigarettes.
   The threat of widespread hunger is a particularly sensitive
issue in Leningrad, where many still remember the Nazi siege of
September 1941 to January 1944, when thousands died of starvation.
   Leonid Dobrovolsky, deputy chairman of the Leningrad Food Supply
Commission, opposed the rationing proposal. He told the council
that state-owned plants might not be able to supply even the
limited amounts of food the council had in mind.
   ``In 1991, none of the food factories in Leningrad will be able
to guarantee the manufacture of foodstuffs or make plans, because
their suppliers are not meeting their obligations and have not
signed new contracts,'' he was quoted as saying by Maxim Korzhavin,
a free-lance Soviet journalist who spoke to The Associated Press by
telephone from Leningrad.
   An alternative proposal would raise prices on basic foodstuffs
to give suppliers an incentive to send food to the city. Poor
families would receive state subsidies or food coupons to make up
for the higher prices.
   But Korzhavin said the majority of the city council members
appeared to favor the expanded rationing.

<HEAD>Ohio Legislator Fails In Attempt to Avoid Libel Suit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs graf 5, At the time, to say Anthony Celebrezze was
candidate for governor.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   An Ohio legislator who used the term ``Mafia''
in opposing the re-election of an Italian member of the state's
highest court failed today in a Supreme Court bid to avoid a libel
lawsuit.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that Robert E.
Netzley, a Republican member of the Ohio House of Representatives
from Miami County, must defend himself against James P.
Celebrezze's lawsuit.
   Today's action clears the way for a trial.
   Celebrezze, a Democrat, was an associate justice of the Ohio
Supreme Court from January 1983 through December 1984. He was
defeated in a 1984 election against Craig W. Wright, a Republican.
   At the time, Celebrezze's brother, Frank D. Celebrezze, was
chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. His cousin, Anthony J.
Celebrezze Jr., was the state's attorney general. Anthony
Celebrezze was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for governor
in this month's election.
   Netzley, who was chairman of the Miami County Republican
Committee, prepared the campaign pamphlet Celebrezze sued over.
   The pamphlet, generally endorsing Republican candidates for
various offices, urged voters to ``Judge the Court.''
   The pamphlet stated: ``It's no wonder that some are calling
Ohio's Justice System the `Mafia Family' Court. Take a look. Frank
Celebrezze, Chief Justice, Brother Jimmy Celebrezze, Associate
Justice, Cousin Tony Celebrezze, Ohio Attorney General, and Frank
Celebrezze's `Crony' Angelo Gagliardi, intimidator in charge of the
Ohio Disciplinary Council.''
   In his lawsuit, Celebrezze contends that no other person had
ever referred to the Ohio Supreme Court members as a Mafia family
and that Netzley knew none of those mentioned in the pamphlet was
in any way connected with the Mafia or organized crime.
   Celebrezze's suit also named as defendants the Miami County
Republican Committee and The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, which
published an article about the pamphlet.
   A state trial judge ordered the Plain Dealer dropped as a
defendant but rejected requests by Netzley and the GOP committee to
have the suit against them dismissed.
   A state appeals court, ruling that the pamphlet was an
expression of opinion, threw out the suit. But the Ohio Supreme
Court, its ranks bolstered by substitute judges who had no conflict
of interest in the case, voted 5-2 last May to reinstate it.
   The state court said the judge's denial of the dismissal
requests could not be appealed until after a trial was conducted.
   Netzley, but not the county GOP committee, then sought help from
the nation's highest court.
   The case is Netzley vs. Celebrezze, 90-480.

   A man was shot and killed today
in a gunfight with undercover soldiers in Northern Ireland, news
reports said.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the man was killed in the
village of Victoria Bridge, 90 miles west of Belfast, when the home
of a member of the security forces came under gunfire.
   ``The army returned fire. One man was killed and a machine gun
was found in a car,'' the constabulary said in a statement. It said
there were no security force casualties, and that ``a number'' of
people were arrested.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said two more
arrests were made after dogs tracked the men to fields close to the
scene.
   Undercover soldiers were guarding the home of the Ulster Defense
Regiment member when the gunmen attacked, the news agency said.
   Quoting unidentified sources, the news agency reported that the
dead man was Alex Patterson, a suspected terrorist with links to
the Irish National Liberation Army.
   The Irish National Liberation Army is an illegal paramilitary
group fighting for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.
   Patterson was the ninth person to be killed by the security
forces in Northern Ireland this year.
   On Jan. 13, three robbery suspects were shot to death by army
undercover officers in west Belfast. The victims were later
determined to be petty criminals armed with fake guns.
   One man was killed by the army in an ambush April 18 near the
home of a police reserve officer. The victim was later identified
as a member of the Irish Peoples' Liberation Army, an anti-British
splinter group.
   On Sept. 31, two teen-age joyriders who drove a stolen car
through a security checkpoint were shot to death in Belfast.
   Soldiers shot and killed an IRA member and member of the IRA's
political wing, Sinn Fein, on Oct. 9.

<HEAD>Louisiana Ruling on Administration of Mind-Altering Drugs Set
Aside</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set aside a ruling
that let Louisiana officials give mind-altering drugs to a
convicted mass murderer in the hope he could be made sane enough to
execute.
   The justices ordered a state court to restudy its ruling in the
case of death row inmate Michael Owen Perry.
   Today's one-paragraph, unsigned opinion directed the Louisiana
court to reconsider Perry's case in light of a Supreme Court
decision in February permitting prison officials to force inmates
to take powerful anti-psychotic drugs without a judge's consent.
   The February ruling gave officials broad power to administer the
drugs to maintain order in the prisons - but only if prison doctors
determined the medication is in the inmate's medical interest.
   It was not immediately clear what effect today's ruling will
have on Perry's case.
   He was convicted of killing his parents and three other
relatives in their Lake Arthur, La., home in 1983.
   Perry was judged to be sane when he committed the crimes and
mentally competent to stand trial. Officials said he became
psychotic while on death row.
   A 1986 Supreme Court ruling bars states from executing anyone
who is insane.
   Psychiatrists have testified that when Perry is taking
anti-psychotic drugs he is competent to be executed - meaning he
realizes he is going to be executed because he killed five people.
   The medical director at Angola Prison in Louisiana testified
that Perry told him, ``It's very simple. Take my pills and die.
Don't take my pills and live.''
   There were no recorded dissents from today's ruling. Justice
David H. Souter did not take part in the case.
   The case is Perry vs. Louisiana, 89-5120.

   A man who said he was among a group of
Americans hiding in Kuwait urged U.S. military action against Iraq
during a telephone call to a television station.
   ``We feel that our protectors have hidden us away well enough
and safe enough so that if they start bombing, we feel very good,
95 percent sure, we can come through the war and get back home,''
the caller said.
   WJW-TV received the unsolicited call Monday and confirmed it
came from Kuwait, producer Tom Reed said. Newsman John O'Day spoke
with men from Ohio and Maryland. The station did not identify them.
   The Ohio caller said the group has gone from place to place to
avoid detection.
   About 2,000 Westerners are believed to be in hiding in Kuwait in
addition to the more than 400 being held by Iraq as so-called human
shields, according to U.S. State Department figures.
   The caller said the consensus among the group is that military
force should be applied as soon as possible.
   ``If they use the military option I really feel that in three or
four days I could be out of Kuwait and ... on a plane back to see
my family,'' he said.
   The caller said the group hangs on every bit of news from the
United States.
   ``We go from a very high high to very low lows,'' he said. ``To
give an example, last week when we heard the president was willing
to wait until February to see if sanctions could work ... we went
from a group of happy guys to two of us crying.''

   A man armed with a high-powered
rifle terrorized a small township today, killing a 5-year-old boy
and a 62-year-old man and wounding two children, police said. A
policeman was also missing.
   Police assisted with a helicopter were scouring steep hillsides
and sandy, open marshland looking for the gunman, believed to be in
his late 20s and a resident of the Aramoana township.
   Hospital officials said the two injured children were in stable
condition after undergoing surgery. Senior Sgt. Bill O'Brien said
of the missing policeman: ``We hold grave fears for his safety.''
   The township, with a population of only around 50, is nearly 20
miles north of Dunedin on the east coast of New Zealand's South
Island.
   O'Brien said the 4-year-old boy and the 9-year-old girl had
undergone surgery for gunshot wounds.
   The 62-year-old man had been admitted to hospital in intensive
care but later died, police said.
   The names of the dead or injured were not immediately released.
   Some residents were trapped in their homes for hours, and others
were spending the night in a nearby town hall.
   Details about the shooting were sketchy.
   Residents said the trouble began when a house caught fire. New
Zealand Press Association quoted resident Dorothy Crimp as saying
she saw the blaze and then heard gunshots ``from all around the
area.''
   A young woman came to her home screaming that her children were
in the burning house, then disappeared, Mrs. Crimp said.
   The agency said another resident reported he went to try to help
put the fire out, but a woman ran toward him screaming that a
neighbor had ``gone crazy'' with a gun.
   Seconds later, the man and several friends were shot at, he
said. The group ran to a nearby mini-van and drove away, with the
driver ducking more shots.

<HEAD>Moscow Stock Exchange Founded, But No Big Board Yet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has created a Moscow Stock
Exchange, the first in the country since the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution.
   The official Tass news agency said the exchange was founded
Monday by 187 Soviet enterprises and banks. It did not say when
trading would begin.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued an order Oct. 26
permitting Soviet citizens to buy stocks, bonds and other
securities as part of his plan to switch from central planning to a
market economy.
   Tass said the Moscow Stock Exchange would be represented
overseas by an international brokerage company that has asked not
to be identified. The exchange plans to open offices in the world's
major stock exchanges in New York, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Singapore,
the news agency said.
   Trading in shares was outlawed following the Bolshevik
Revolution. A flourishing stock market in St. Petersburg, now
Leningrad, was closed along with more than 100 commodity exchanges
elsewhere in Russia.
   The New York Stock Exchange recently gave a three-day seminar in
Moscow on how to revive, operate and regulate financial markets.
   NYSE Chairman John Phelan and his Soviet hosts agreed that
limited trading could begin within a year.
   Soviet businessman Eduard Tenyakov, one of the main organizers
of a Moscow stock exchange, said the ruble would be valued on a par
with the U.S. dollar in estimating the currency exchange values of
shares.
   The ruble is not a convertible currency, and exchange rates are
set artifically by the government. A new commercial exchange rate
was imposed on Nov. 1, cutting the value of the Soviet currency by
nearly 70 percent to discourage imports.
   The new rate for international commercial transactions is 1.8
rubles per U.S. dollar, compared to the old .56 rubles to the
dollar.
   The rate for foreign tourists exchanging money in the Soviet
Union remained unchanged at six rubles to the dollar.

<HEAD>CNN Reports Iraq Diverted USDA Loans to Buy Trucks, Hardware</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq may have used U.S.-backed loans to obtain
trucks and other equipment for its invasion of Kuwait, and
kickbacks on its subsidized purchases of U.S. food to buy weapons,
according to a report.
   Cable News Network reported Monday that Iraq diverted millions
of dollars from loans backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
- intended to help Iraq buy surplus food from U.S. farmers - to
obtain trucks and other hardware used in the invasion.
   ``Unfortunately, the U.S. soldier in Operation Desert Shield
faces an Iraqi army that probably has been fed with USDA-guaranteed
loans on food and has been transported around the country of Iraq
on transportation equipment that was provided as bribes for
companies to do business with Iraq,'' Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C.,
told CNN.
   ``And that should send a cold shiver up and down the back of
every American,'' he added.
   Iraq has borrowed $5 billion in USDA-backed loans since 1983,
when President Reagan started the program to aid the Iraqis in
their war with Iran and to help U.S. farmers sell surplus
commodities.
   Iraq still owes $2 billion on the loans, but stopped making
payments when it invaded Kuwait this summer.
   Although Iraq was supposed to buy only food and other
agriculture products with the loans, Iraqi officials demanded the
American exporters give them trucks, trailers, cranes, spare parts
and other industrial equipment as part of their purchases, CNN
said, citing federal investigation reports.
   Investigators also believe Iraq used the U.S.-backed loans to
buy weapons by overpaying American companies for food and then
demanding that they transfer cash kickbacks to bank accounts in
Europe, CNN said.
   CNN said several unidentified agricultural companies confirmed
that they wired money to European banks for Iraq, but said Iraqi
officials told them the money would be used to buy agriculture
items, not weapons.
   Rose told the network: ``Federal investigators have told me that
they have found instances in which ammunitions and guns, instead of
agriculture commodities, went to Iraq under these loan programs.
   ``I'm horrified.''

<HEAD>Court to Decide Union Grievance Issue in California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide in a
case from California whether employers sometimes must submit a
union's grievance to arbitration even though the complaint centers
on a since-expired contract.
   The justices said they will review rulings that, if upheld,
would force Litton Financial Printing Division, a subsidiary of
Litton Industries Inc., to submit a 1980 dispute to arbitration.
   Litton prints blank checks at six plants, where employees are
represented by the Printing Specialties District Council No. 2.
   In November 1980, Litton decided to close down the ``cold-type''
printing operation at its Santa Clara, Calif., plant and expand its
``hot-type'' operation there.
   The move sparked the laying off of 10 employees who had worked
in the cold-type operation. The employees were not laid off on the
basis of plantwide seniority.
   The collective bargaining agreement with the printers' union had
expired in October 1979 - about 11 months before the layoff dispute
arose. Litton was refusing to recognize or bargain with the union.
   The expired contract contained a grievance-arbitration procedure
for resolving such disputes, and the union filed grievances for
each of the 10 laid-off employees.
   Litton, noting that the contract had expired, refused to process
the grievances.
   The union then filed unfair labor practice complaints with the
National Labor Relations Board, and the board ruled that Litton had
violated federal labor law.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the board's ruling
last January.
   ``The board reasonably concluded that the layoff was a mandatory
subject of bargaining and that Litton, therefore, violated (the
National Labor Relations Act) by refusing to bargain about the
layoff decision,'' the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Litton argued that
just as the employer had no obligation to bargain over shutting
down the cold-type printing operations in Santa Clara, it had no
obligation to bargain over the resulting layoffs.
   ``There is no obligation ... to arbitrate seniority grievances
based upon facts which occur long after contract expiration,'' the
appeal said.
   Justice Department lawyers had urged the court to reject the
appeal.
   The case is Litton Financial Printing Division vs. NLRB, 90-285.

<HEAD>Court Asks Administration Views on Black Voting Rights in Arkansas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration its views of whether a special federal court may
protect black voting rights in Arkansas by forcing officials to get
its approval before making election changes there.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before saying whether it will hear arguments by Arkansas officials
that the three-judge panel improperly exceeded its authority.
   The government's response could take months.
   The three-judge court, by a 2-1 vote in May, ruled that state
officials must get its approval before making changes affecting
majority-vote requirements in the state's general elections.
   The lower court also said any plan to reapportion state
legislative districts based on the 1990 census must be delayed for
60 days after a plan's adoption by a state apportionment board.
   The delay will allow time for any voting rights challenge to the
new districts, the three-judge court said.
   The lower court invoked a so-called pre-clearance provision of
the federal Voting Rights Act, giving federal courts power in some
cases to review election changes in southern states.
   The pre-clearance authority is based on a finding that blacks
were victims of deliberate voting rights abuses in the past, the
three-judge court said - not merely that past practices
unintentionally diluted black voting strength.
   The panel cited four such abuses in which the Arkansas
Legislature hampered the ability of black candidates to win local
offices. Black candidates who amassed pluralities in earlier
elections lost after laws were changed to require majority
victories in a runoff.
   ``Devotion to majority rule for local offices lay dormant as
long as the plurality system produced white officeholders,'' the
three-judge court said. ``But whenever black candidates used this
system sucessfully ... the response was swift and certain. Laws
were passed ... to close off this avenue of black political
victory.''
   The three-judge court said it credited testimony by Gov. Bill
Clinton that the pace of political reform in Arkansas is
quickening, and that the rights of blacks are being protected. But
the lower court said the state's past record still warrants
intervention by the federal courts.
   The Supreme Court has asked the Bush administration for its
views in a related Arkansas case, in which black voters in a rural
county challenged a majority-vote requirement for party primaries
and countywide general elections. Lower courts have upheld the
system.
   The case acted on today is Clinton vs. Jeffers, 90-394.

<TEXT>
   A sale of Impressionist and modern paintings
from the estate of Henry Ford II brought $20 million less than
expected, further proof that the air has been let out of the art
market balloon.
   ``I think if it was held six months ago it would have gone
better,'' said Sotheby's auctioneer John Marion after Monday's
auction.
   Thirteen of the 36 artworks were not sold because bidding failed
to meet the minimum price set by the seller.
   Of the 23 works sold, 13 went for less than the presale
estimate.
   Tonight at Sotheby's, the art collection of the late Greta Garbo
will go on the block, including three works by Auguste Renoir.
   The Ford collection included works by Paul Cezanne, Amedeo
Modigliani, Henri Matisse, Joan Miro and Marc Chagall.
   The auction had been expected to fetch more than $50 million,
but winning bids totaled just $30.43 million.
   Ford, who was vice chairman of Sotheby's from 1960 to 1980 and
headed Ford Motor Co. from 1945 to 1980, died in 1987. He was the
grandson of automobile magnate Henry Ford.
   Some blamed the low prices on the quality of the art.
   ``The Ford collection is not great,'' said Manhattan dealer
Edward Nahem.
   Others blamed the falling market.
   ``Every speculator in any market likes to buy when it's going
up,'' said Paris art dealer Mickey Tiroche.
   Marion even suggested that the Gulf conflict could be having an
impact.
   ``There's nobody walking the earth that doesn't have some
feeling about what's happening in the Middle East and there is no
way it could not have some effect on buying,'' said Marion.
   Renoir's ``The Cup of Chocolate'' was auctioned apart from the
rest of the Ford collection and fetched $18.15 million. The
painting was valued at $15 million to $18 million.
   At Sotheby's sale of postwar art last week, only half the works
offered sold. In contrast, the last few seasons saw paintings
routinely sold at record-breaking prices.
   On Wednesday, Christie's auction house will offer a still life
by Vincent Van Gogh, ``Vase With Daisies and Poppies,'' valued at
$12 million to $16 million.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set aside a Nebraska
murderer's death sentence, and ordered the state's highest court to
restudy his case.
   The justices told the Nebraska Supreme Court to reconsider
Randolph Reeves' sentence in light of their decision in a
Mississippi case last March that gave state appeals courts greater
authority to uphold such sentences.
   The court in that March ruling said state courts may uphold
death sentences even if sentencing juries wrongly considered some
adverse evidence.
   The justices said in the Mississippi case that state appeals
courts are enpowered to reweigh aggravating and mitigating evidence
in capital punishment cases without sending them back for new jury
determinations.
   Reeves was convicted of the March 29, 1980, fatal stabbings of
Janet Mesner and Victoria Lamm in Lincoln.
   The case is Reeves vs. Nebraska, 90-5659.

<HEAD>European Farmers Protest GATT Trade Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of European farmers, some wielding
pitchforks and clanging cowbells, marched through the city today to
protest efforts to cut agricultural subsidies at world trade talks.
   About 10,000 farmers demonstrated outside the administrative
headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in
Geneva, site of the talks on freeing commerce in farm products and
14 other areas.
   The farmers, mainly from France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland,
carried signs denouncing the talks and singling out U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills for ``destroying European farmers.''
   GATT farm talks were suspended after Washington and a group of
allied farm exporting nations rejected as insufficient a European
Community offer for cuts in state supports.
   France and Germany led opposition inside the 12-nation EC to
offering even the proposal now on the table.
   ``Millions of family farms in Europe are threatened in their
extistence due to the proposals at the GATT talks,'' a leaflet
distributed by the demonstrators said. ``Free trade without
barriers ... destroys structures oriented toward family farming,
forces an industrialization of agriculture and creates instability
on agrarian markets.''
   The farmers said they do not oppose ``sensible adaptation'' and
proposed ``an improved balance of markets'' in international
agriculture.
   GATT Director-General Arthur Dunkel of Switzerland received a
farmer delegation inside the trade organization's lakeside
building. The marchers then continued through Geneva.
   No injuries were reported in the demonstration. Swiss police
were out in force for the protest.
   Dunkel, who oversees the entire GATT talks, warned on Monday
that plans to conclude an ambitious package of market-opening
accords at a Dec. 3-7 ministerial meeting are ``now in jeopardy.''
   In an emergency meeting of senior negotiators, he appealed to
all sides to show more flexibility within a matter of days.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said last week it
would be ``a big mistake to even contemplate extending the
negotiations.''
   The United States and the Australian-led, 13-nation Cairns
group, which also includes major Third World farm exporters, on
Saturday refused negotiations on an EC offer to cut farm supports
by 30 percent.
   The proposal provides for cuts in overall aid over 10 years
backdated to 1986, thus giving the EC credit for mesaures already
taken.
   There are no separate provisions for cutting export subsidies,
which Washington has said it considers indispensable.
   The United States and the Cairns group are seeking cuts of 75
percent in domestic supports and import barriers, and 90 percent in
export subsidies, spaced over 10 years with 1991 as base year.

   Construction workers dug up 23

the state news agency CTK reported Tuesday.
   The first skeleton was found Monday morning in a residential
area of the town, 50 miles northwest of Prague. By Tuesday, 23 had
been unearthed, the agency said.
   Experts estimate the skeletons were buried 25 to 50 years ago,
CTK said, adding that all were males and relatively young when they
died.
   The disordered positions of the skeletons indicated a mass grave

   Collins Funeral Home doesn't just want to
bury its customers. It wants to marry them, too.
   The funeral home's Abundant Living Center, opening Sunday, will
be offered as a place for weddings. The standard marriage vow,
``until death do us part,'' will take on a new meaning, said
Collins vice president Annette Rollins.
   ``We wanted to go one step farther in providing a service to our
customers,'' Rollins said Monday. ``We think it's a natural for us.
We want to help a couple plan for the life ahead of them.''
   And, of course, the afterlife as well.
   ``We want to be a part of more than just the final event in a
person's life,'' said Rollins, a cousin of company president Mary
A. Collins.
   Rollins said the 87-year-old funeral home got the idea from
professional journals.
   ``We've read about this in other parts of the country,'' she
said. ``Mary said she would like a way to help our customers and
friends in more ways than just the death experience. We feel this
is only proper.''
   No weddings are scheduled yet in the new 250-seat center, but
several have made inquiries.
   Customers who might balk at marrying in a building owned by a
funeral home probably haven't considered that churches are used for
both purposes, Rollins said. ``A church can be a happy place or a
sad place - it depends on the occasion. This is the same.''

   The Agriculture Ministry warned people Tuesday
against covering fatty foods in plastic wrap or cooking foods
covered in the clingy plastic that it said could cause cancer.
   In a ministry report, government scientists said foods with a
high fat content, like cheese, cooked meats and butter, should not
be wrapped in plastic film because the fat acts as a solvent
releasing the plastic's chemicals into the food.
   The Ministry of Agriculture report called for toxicological
studies on the chemicals used in food industry packaging.
   Consumer organizations recommended storing food in a bowl
covered with a plate. The Consumers' Association appealed for
warnings on plastic wrap boxes telling people not to wrap fatty
foods in the film.
   The government report said the intake of the plasticizer DEHA
used in PVC-based cling film has been substantially reduced and
that the intake of the chemical acetyl tributyl citrate has
increased because of the increased use of plastic wraps developed
especially for microwaves.

   Iran on Tuesday freed 44 Egyptians
captured while fighting alongside Iraqi troops during the 1980-88
Persian Gulf war, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the prisoners were
freed in response to a request by Egyptian theologians visiting
Tehran. They were handed over to Sheik Mohammed Ghazali, a
prominent Egyptian theologian.
   Egyptian press reports have estimated that Iran seized 13,000 to
20,000 Egyptians during the war. Hundreds of other Arabs, mainly
Lebanese and Somali soldiers, also were captured before a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted hostilities in August 1988.
   After the cease-fire, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani moved
to end Iran's international isolation and improve ties with Arab
and other countries.
   The prisoner release is seen as a gesture by Tehran to end more
than a decade of acrimony with Cairo. It moved the two countries
closer to the establishment of relations.
   Egypt granted asylumn to the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
after he was toppled by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The shah
died in Cairo in July 1980. Iran also is critical of Egypt's 1979
peace treaty with Israel.

<HEAD>Too Much TV Linked to High Cholesterol in Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grade-school children who watch two hours of
television a day are at increased risk of having high cholesterol
levels, and the risk climbs the more they watch, researchers said
Tuesday.
   Children watching television four hours a day are four times as
likely to have high cholesterols as are children who watch less
than two hours, the researchers reported.
   Previous research showed that children who watched too much
television exercised less, were overweight and had bad diets.
   ``We made the next step - to look at TV and cholesterol,'' said
Thomas K. Hei, who reported the findings at the annual meeting of
the American Heart Association.
   ``The message is if you can't get your children to stop watching
TV, maybe get them to exercise more and keep them from unhealthy
food,'' said Hei, a student at the University of California,
Irvine.
   The study of 1,077 suburban Southern California children
demonstrated that television habits are the best clue to
identifying children with high cholesterol, said Dr. Kurt V. Gold
of the University of California, Irvine, who directed the study.
   In families with a history of heart disease or high cholesterol
levels, television habits ``facilitated the identification of nine
out of 10 of the children with cholesterol levels above 200,'' Gold
said.
   ``It provides another tool to help us identify the many children
with elevated blood cholesterol levels who might otherwise go
undetected.''
   Peggy Charren, the president of Action for Children's
Television, blamed television commercials shown during children's
shows.
   ``The food messages you get for children couldn't be worse,''
she said.
   ``We have never sold kids the foods that anyone wants them to
eat. We sell candy, we sell high-fat snacks and we push fast-food
restaurants.''
   The average American child watches 23 hours of television per
week, Charren said.
   The children in the study who watched two to four hours of
television a day were average viewers. Hei and Gold found that the
children's risk of having elevated cholesterol levels was 50
percent higher than children who watched less than two hours of
television per day.
   The two researchers sent questionnaires to parents whose
children had had their cholesterol tested. The questionnaires
inquired about the children's television viewing habits and the
family's history of heart disease.
   Nearly all of the chldren in the study were between ages 2 and
12, with an average age of 7, Hei said. They were mostly white and
upper-middle class, he said.
   The American Academy of Pediatrics, which supported the study,
says any child with a cholesterol level over 175 should be treated.
   ``Since cholesterol levels tend to rise somewhat when a child
reaches adulthood, many of these children could have dangerously
high levels in later life,'' Gold said. A level above 240 is
considered high for adults, and levels between 200 and 240 are
``borderline high,'' according to the American Heart Association.
   ``It would be wonderful if you could buy a TV set that only
operates when the people watching it are exercising,'' Gold said.

<HEAD>Monterey Looks for Federal Law to Help Evict Sea Lions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Monterey harbor has become a sort of
Sea Lion Motel where the sardines are plenty and the living is
easy. But the pinnipeds may soon face eviction as officials renew
their fight to roust the mammals.
   City officials hope to drive away the mammals by enforcing a
proposed amendment to a 1972 federal law that protects sea lions
from harm. The change, which could go into effect early next year,
would make it illegal to feed marine mammals, putting an end to
concessionaires selling sea lion snacks that tourists have used to
lure the animals to shore.
   ``To the average Joe, the sea lions look like something out of a
Walt Disney movie, but until you go down to the docks and stand
right next to one of these monsters, it's hard to understand what
the city is dealing with,'' said Mitch Whippern, administrative
assistant for the Monterey Public Facilities Department.
   Most of the hundreds of sea lions who gather off the Monterey
coast sun themselves on rocks about a football field away from the
harbor. But tourists have lured dozens of the animals to the wharf
and onto floating boat slips - to the dismay of city officials and
fishermen.
   A dozen of the 300- to 800-pound mammals recently climbed on a
tugboat and sank it. Others have prevented some boat owners from
docking. The city has spent $40,000 so far this year repairing sea
lion damage at the docks.
   Whippern said city officials have tried to scare away the sea
lions by spraying them with high pressure hoses, banging together
garbage cans, hitting brooms against the docks and using an
ultrasonic whistle.
   ``If we had a guy out there with a hose all day we could keep
them off, but if you leave for a minute they come right back,''
Whippern said.

<HEAD>Report Says Farm Credit System Was Reckless In Lending Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report financed by the American Bankers
Association said Tuesday the cooperatively owned Farm Credit System
fueled a land boom in the 1970s that ultimately led to hard times
in the 1980s.
   The report said a 1971 law liberalizing collateral requirements
for farm real estate loans made by the system ``unleashed a boom in
land prices in rural America that saw the inflation-adjusted value
of farmland nearly double from 1971 to 1980,''
   But the report added, ``This land boom was unsustainable, and
the bubble burst in 1980. By 1986, six years later, the average
real value of farmland had dropped back almost to its 1971 level.''
   The 1971 law raised the system's collateral limit to 85 percent
of the market value of farmland from the previous standard of 65
percent of its agricultural income-producing value.
   The report, ``The Farm Credit System: Reckless Lender to Rural
America,'' was prepared for the American Bankers Association by Ely
&amp; Company Inc., an Alexandria, Va., financial consulting firm.
   Ron Erickson, a spokesman for the Farm Credit Administration,
which oversees the system, said he had not seen the report.
   But Erickson said it has been widely known and talked about for
years that ``during the '70s when commodity prices were good and
land values were inflating, farmers were eager to expand and were
borrowing heavily to do so. They were basing that - and so were the
lenders - on inflated land values.''
   Erickson added in a telephone interview from his office in
McLean, Va., that the boost in the lending limit allowed by the
1971 law was an important signal.
   In fact, he said, the previous lending limit of 65 percent of
farmland's agricultural value was ``usually around 50 percent'' of
the land's market value. Thus, the increase to 85 percent of market
value was, in effect, even greater in many cases.
   Bert Ely, president of the consulting firm, said Tuesday in
remarks prepared for a conference in Denver, Colo., sponsored by
the bankers, that the Farm Credit System unwisely used its new
powers in the 1970s to overlend to American farmers.
   Ely said the ensuing financial crunch on farmers will ultimately
cost taxpayers about $100 billion.
   ``As a result of the damage caused by FCS overlending, federal
government payments to farmers in the 1982-89 period exceeded the
earlier eight-year period by $75 billion, measured in 1990
dollars,'' he said.
   ``Future government payments to farmers plus losses suffered by
the Farmers Home Administration account for the balance of this
$100 billion fiasco,'' Ely added.
   The Farm Credit System, which includes federal land bank
associations and other lending entities, is traditionally subject
to federal government oversight. But it ran into huge financial
difficulties in the early 1980s, with Congress in 1987 passing a
package of reforms and financial bailout.
   Ely said the 1987 reforms, however, did not roll back the
collateral liberalization of the 1971 law.
   ``Therefore,'' he said, ``the FCS still has the power to
overlend again to American farmers and to spark yet another
farmland boom (and) bust.''

   Paramilitary riot police fired tear gas and
live ammunition to disperse more than 1,000 supporters of
pro-democracy activists who went on trial today for allegedly
holding an illegal political meeting.
   The trial was adjourned, and the magistrate demanded an
explanation for the police action. At least 14 people were
arrested, and one witness said a youth was shot in the leg and that
other people suffered minor injuries and the effects of tear gas.
   Hundreds of baton-wielding police, some on horseback, fought
running battles with supporters outside the small courthouse in
this farming center 175 miles southwest of the capital, Lusaka.
   Rioting spread to a nearby shopping district, where the windows
of several stores were smashed. Witnesses said at least four stores
were looted of electrical goods and foodstuffs.
   Some rioters wearing T-shirts with pro-democracy inscriptions
chanted political slogans and hurled stones at police. Other
rioters urged police to disobey their commanders.
   On trial were labor leader Frederick Chiluba and eight
colleagues in the Movement for Multiparty Democracy. After police
fired warning shots into the air, Magistrate Sylvester Simachela
adjourned the trial and demanded an explanation from state
prosecutors.
   State prosecutors told Simachela that police opened fire in
self-defense after crowds began throwing stones. At that, the
public benches in the court erupted in shouts of ``Liar, liar!''
   ``I don't think there is any court in the country that can sit
with these gunshots going on outside,'' the magistrate told the
court, packed to capacity by about 100 spectators.
   New rioting broke out later in the afternoon. It was not clear
when the hearing would resume.
   Before the adjournment, Chiluba, head of the powerful Zambia
Congress of Trade Unions, and his eight fellow pro-democracy
activists pleaded innocent to conducting illegal political
activities.
   They were charged with convening an illegal meeting in Choma on
Oct. 16 and belonging to an illegal political organization. Both
charges carry a maximum penalty of six months in jail.
   Attorneys for the pro-democracy leaders say they will argue that
the Oct. 16 meeting and the existence of the pro-democracy movement
are protected by freedom of association clauses in the
constitution.
   Zambia has a one-party system imposed by President Kenneth
Kaunda in 1973.
   He has promised to hold multiparty elections next year. But
proposed constitutional changes allowing the formation of new
political organizations is not scheduled for debate by legislators
until Nov. 20.
   Pro-democracy activists in Choma accused the police of provoking
today's rioting to discredit their supporters.
   Kaunda has frequently argued that a multiparty system would lead
to unrest touched off by tribal rivalries.

   State legislators erred when they passed a
law that allows poor students in Milwaukee to attend private
schools using state funds, an appeals court ruled today.
   The 4th District Court of Appeals in Madison said it was
unconstitutional because the law was passed as part of the state
budget. The court said that violated a provision in the state
constitution designed to prevent bills benefiting local interests
from being ``smuggled'' through the Legislature.
   The court did not directly address the merits of the school
choice program.
   The program, passed last spring and begun this fall, allows
parents to send their children to non-sectarian, private schools
with state funds.
   The program was authorized to provide a $2,500 stipend each for
as many as 1,000 students this year, but only about 400 were able
to enroll in about 10 eligible private schools because of space
limitations.
   The money for the program comes from state aid provided to the
Milwaukee Public Schools system, which has about 97,000 students.
   The program is the first in the nation to directly provide
parents with a voucher to allow them to send their students out of
public schools and into private institutions.
   Critics charge it undermines public education and benefits only
a few while ignoring the majority of students left behind in
declining public schools.
   Roger Sundby, assistant to state Schools Superintendent Herbert
Grover, said the program will continue for at least 30 days to
allow for further appeals.
   Sundby said the state Department of Public Instruction, which
has opposed the program, considered the ruling a victory but would
have preferred a ruling on the program's merits.

   President Francois Mitterrand on Tuesday gave two
paintings by Spanish-born artist Pablo Picasso to President Felipe
Gonzalez of Spain.
   ``This gesture affirms one more time the links of friendship
between our two peoples,'' Mitterrand said.
   The two works, ``The Rooftops of Barcelona'' painted in 1903,
and ``Homage to Spaniards Killed For France,'' finished in 1947,
made up part of the artist's personal collection.
   Picasso, who died in 1973 at age 91, spent most of his life in
France. But he asked his heirs to return the two paintings to his
native country.
   The donation was worked out between Picasso's estate and the
French government to circumvent strict laws forbidding the export
of art works from France.
   ``The Rooftops of Barcelona,'' from the artist's celebrated blue
period, will go on display at the Picasso Museum in Barcelona. The
other painting goes to the Prado in Madrid.
   The donation came at a summit meeting between the two leaders on
their policies on European unity and the Persian Gulf crisis.

<HEAD>Doctors Predict Many More Heart Transplants for Children</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of children receiving heart transplants
is likely to increase substantially as doctors find new uses for
this dramatic surgery and overcome a critical shortage of organs,
physicians predict.
   Doctors at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association
also said the outlook for young heart transplant patients is
improving, largely because of better ways to prevent their bodies
from rejecting the new organs.
   The use of heart transplants, especially in the very young, grew
quickly during the past decade. In 1979, doctors performed just one
of these operations in children. By 1989, there were 187 operations
at 58 hospitals around the world.
   ``I think the number will become much larger,'' said Dr. David
Baum of Stanford University. ``Transplantation in the very young
will become a more widely accepted procedure, especially as
survival is increased.''
   Until now, heart transplants in the young have been reserved
largely for children with a muscle disease called cardiomyopathy.
But several doctors said the procedure is being expanded to
children with severe heart birth defects.
   ``As our success continues to improve and as patients' chances
for lifelong survival increase, we are starting to perform
transplants for conditions in which there are other surgical
interventions,'' said Dr. Daniel Bernstein, another Stanford
physician.
   Until recently, doctors' only option for youngsters with
misformed hearts was to try to fix the abnormality surgically. But
the operations are often very risky and doctors believe that
replacing the heart entirely may be safer for some young patients.
   Bernstein said Stanford doctors have performed 20 transplants in
youngsters with birth defects, and are ``extremely encouraged.''
   Among the best known young transplant recipients was Stormie
Jones, who received a new heart and liver in the same operation in
1984. The girl died Sunday at age 13 after developing problems with
her transplanted organs.
   One of her physicians, Dr. David Bilheimer of the University of
Texas in Dallas, said she would have died years ago without the
transplants.
   ``There is not anything else we could have done for her,'' he
said. ``For five years, she had an excellent quality of life.''
   As heart transplants become more routine, patients' survival has
increased. At Stanford, for instance, 75 percent of patients are
still alive one year after their operations, and 70 percent survive
at least five years.
   The improvement in the survival of transplant patients,
including children, results largely from the discovery of
cyclosporine, a drug that keeps the body from rejecting the foreign
organ.
   Dr. F. Jay Fricker of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh said
doctors there have treated 12 young patients with an experimental
new drug called FK506, which he said in preliminary use appears to
work better than cyclosporine.
   But a shortage of donor organs continues to limit the number of
operations. Dr. Mark Boucek of Loma Linda University said 40,000
children whose organs could be donated die each year, but less than
half of 1 percent of their organs are offered for transplants.
   ``If we could have a yield of 2 percent of all deaths, we would
probably be able to satisfy all of the babies who could benefit
from transplants,'' Boucek said.
   But Baum said he believes the situation is improving, in part as
more doctors and parents become willing to suggest using the organs
of young victims.
   Also, he said doctors are finding better ways to preserve organs
so they can be transported farther. And they are also finding ways
to keep young patients alive with mechanical pumping devices until
donated organs arive.
   He noted that many insurance commpany also have recently agreed
to routinely pay for children's heart transplants and that should
make the procedure more widely available.

threatening to appoint government-paid attorneys. Picks up 9th

<TEXT>
   A federal judge, frustrated by delays in paying
Manuel Noriega's attorneys, said today he will appoint two
government-paid defense attorneys if their fee problem is not
resolved by Friday.
   ``It is obvious that we simply may not be able to unfreeze any
money,'' U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said during a hearing
on the fees.
   In June, Hoeveler ordered prosecutors to unfreeze about $6
million in 27 Noriega-linked bank accounts for use by the Noriega's
private lawyers.
   But five months later, defense lawyers have not received a
penny, and today they asked Hoeveler to light a fire under the U.S.
government and banks in France, Switzerland and Austria, to release
the funds.
   But Justice Department attorney Drew Arena told the judge that
the foreign governments had frozen the accounts for their own
investigations and have so far refused to release them despite the
U.S. government's request.
   The problem is the United States had alleged the money was drug
proceeds, but was now reversing course by asking that it be given
to Noriega, Arena said.
   ``It's rather, your honor, like trying to `unring' a bell,''
Arena said.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino accused the U.S. State
Department of undermining efforts to unfreeze the funds by
encouraging foreign governments to act on their own. Hoeveler,
however, said he was frustrated by the delays and wanted the case
to proceed as quickly as possible.
   The judge has agreed that the trial will not begin Jan. 28, but
said it will not be delayed by much.
   Under the law covering court-appointed counsel, the attorneys
could receive only a maximum of $60 an hour, far less than the $350
an hour Noriega's attorneys have said they needed.
   Meanwhile, Noriega and Cable News Network have agreed to let the
U.S. Supreme Court decide whether the deposed Panamanian dictator's
tape-recorded conversations with his lawyers can be broadcast.
   CNN aire excerpts of one tape over the weekend in defiance of
Hoeveler.
   The defense and the network agreed Monday to suspend their feud
until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether CNN's free-press
rights outweigh Noriega's right to a fair trial. The network
planned to file the appeal this week.
   ``I will be interested in seeing what the Supreme Court will do
in this novel situation,'' Hoeveler said.
   The Atlanta-based network agreed not to play any of the disputed
tapes until the Supreme Court rules. In return, Noriega's defense
delayed a request for contempt penalties of up to $300,000 per
broadcast against the network, and Hoeveler stayed his order that
CNN hand over seven disputed tapes to the court.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network had the right to
play other Noriega tapes as long as they did not include
conversations with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
   CNN defied Hoeveler by broadcasting on Friday and Saturday an
excerpt of a tape in which Noriega spoke in Spanish with a defense
attorney's secretary, who translated for his defense team. On the
tape, Noriega speculated that the government would use as witnesses
against him two Panamanians in U.S. custody.
   Rubino has said he will seek dismissal of all charges against
Noriega, alleging government misconduct in recording the calls made
from the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami.
   Noriega has been held there since his surrender to U.S. forces
shortly after the invasion of Panama in December. He is accused of
accepting $4.6 million in bribes to protect the cocaine trade.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today threw out the murder
conviction of a Louisiana man because the jury that convicted him
was given an impermissible definition of ``beyond a reasonable
doubt.''
   The justices unanimously ruled that Tommy Cage, currently an
inmate on Louisiana's death row, is entitled to a new trial.
   In other action, the court:
   - Set aside a ruling that let Louisiana officials give
mind-altering drugs to a convicted mass murderer in the hope he
could be made sane enough to execute.
   The justices ordered a state court to restudy its ruling in the
case of death row inmate Michael Owen Perry. The one-paragraph,
unsigned opinion ordered reconsideration of the case in light of a
Supreme Court opinion in February permitting prison officials to
force inmates to take powerful anti-psychotic drugs without a
judge's consent.
   - Agreed to hear an appeal by a Maryland man who said a federal
judge illegally increased his sentence.
   The justices said they will use the case of Thomas Braxton to
decide whether federal judges may base stiffer sentences on a
charge that was dismissed.
   - Turned down the bid of an Ohio legislator, Robert E. Netzley,
to avoid a libel lawsuit for using the term ``Mafia'' in opposing
the re-election of James P. Celebrezze to the state's highest
court.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that Netzley, a
Republican member of the Ohio House of Representatives from Miami
County, must defend himself against Celebrezze's lawsuit.
   - Turned away an effort by Tom Perdue, onetime top aide to
Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris, to kill a libel lawsuit against him
by state Public Service Commission member J. Mac Barber.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Barber's
allegations that Perdue falsely accused him of bribery should go to
a jury.
   Cage had been convicted of fatally shooting Arthur Johnson while
robbing him of a gold chain and medallion on a New Orleans street
corner April 16, 1986. Cage had been sentenced to death for the
crime.
   Jurors who convicted Cage were told they had to conclude he was
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
   The judge said, ``This doubt, however, must be a reasonable one;
that is one that is founded upon a real tangible substantial basis
and not upon mere caprice and conjecture. It must be such doubt as
would give rise to a grave uncertainty ... What is required is not
an absolute or mathematical certainty, but a moral certainty.''
   The Louisiana Supreme Court, in upholding Cage's conviction and
death sentence, said the jury instruction was constitutionally
permissible when taken in its complete context.
   But today the nation's highest court said the state court was
wrong.
   ``It is plain to us that the words `substantial' and `grave' as
they are commonly understood suggest a higher degree of doubt than
is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard,''
the justices said in an unsigned opinion.
   ``A reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction to
allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that
required by the (Constitution's) due process clause,'' the justices
said.
   The case is Cage vs. Louisiana, 89-7302.

   Two senior Republican senators today called for a special
session of Congress to authorize action against Iraq, and Saddam
Hussein's chief deputy flew to Morroco to discuss an Arab attempt
to avert war in the Persian Gulf.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R.-Ind., said a congressional vote would
give Saddam and the world another signal that President Bush's gulf
policies have overwhelming American support and that his threats of
force are ``credible.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole called for a ``declaration of
support and a willingness to commit whatever resources it takes to
fulfill the mission.''
   A Democratic critic of Bush's decision to send 200,000 more
troops to the gulf agreed that Congress needs to play a greater
role in the crisis.
   But the White House rejected the idea of a special session of
Congress.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't
think that's necessary ... there is no war.'' He also said the
president believes he has consulted sufficiently with members of
Congress and will continue to do so.
   In other developments today:
   -Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark said Iraq will
release four more American hostages. Clark spoke in Amman, the
Jordanian capital, after concluding an independent peace mission to
Baghdad. Danish radio said Iraq also agreed today to release some
of the 38 Danish hostages held in Baghdad.
   -President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made a surprise trip to Libya
and met leader Moammar Gadhafi for talks on the gulf situation. The
visit came a day after Deputy Premier Saadoun Hammadi of Iraq held
talks with Gadhafi.
   -British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she believes
Saddam is close to acquiring nuclear weapons. Speaking in the House
of Commons, she reiterated that force must be used unless Iraq ends
its 3-month-old occupation of Kuwait.
   -Cable News Network reported that Iraq may have used kickbacks
paid by American companies to purchase weapons it used in the
Kuwaiti invasion. CNN also said Monday Iraq diverted millions of
dollars from U.S. Department of Agriculture-backed loans to buy
trucks and other hardware used in the invasion. There was no
immediate comment from the Bush administration on the report.
   Regarding the call by Lugar today, Bush refused to comment on
whether a special session of Congress was needed when questioned by
a reporter at the start of a Cabinet meeting this morning.
   Lugar, speaking on the NBC's Today show, said: ``I think the
president must lay out now to the nation and the Congress
specifically what our aims are.
   ``And then he must call for a session of the Congress and set a
date for the return of the Congress to debate those issues and
vote, affirmatively I would presume, so that we have authorization
for what is required.''
   Lugar, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
he was not suggesting what form an authorization vote should take.
   ``It occurs to me congressional leaders and the president can
agree upon an authorization, but clearly the president needs to
have an up-and-down vote by members of the Congress representing
the people of this country, so that our unity is clear, our staying
power is clear and the people around the world, friend and foe
alike, know that we are in this.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, who publicly questioned Bush's decision to deploy
another 200,000 troops to the gulf, agreed ``the Congress should be
involved here.''
   ``If there ever is a casebook example of the constitutional
power of congress to declare war, this is it,'' the Georgia
Democrat and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said
on the same program.
   Before leaving Baghdad for Morocco, Iraq's first deputy prime
minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said he was carrying a letter from
Saddam to the Moroccan leader, King Hassan II, noting the ``dangers
facing the Arabs'' by the gulf crisis, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
   Morocco has contributed 1,700 troops to the multinational force
that has massed in the Saudi desert following Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, but the nation has maintained contact with the
Iraqi leadership.
   Ramadan said Baghdad ``supports any serious Arab effort on any
level that will serve the interests of the Arab nation.'' But he
said Arab summits ``should not be forums at which the American
Pentagon's policies are translated into Arabic.''
   He repeated the three conditions Iraq has set for attending such
a meeting: that Iraq is consulted in advance on the agenda; the
timing and location are chosen so that Saddam will be able to
attend, and the agenda also include all Middle East issues,
including the Palestine question.
   Saddam has insisted on tying his withdrawal from Kuwait to
Israel's pulling back from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

   The singing police squad of ABC's `op Rock''
will warble its last verse on Dec. 26.
   Cancellation rumors have circulated for weeks, but ABC
steadfastly denied them until Monday, when it issued a statement
announcing the decision.
   ABC today said ``Equal Justice,'' a one-hour legal drama about
the professional and private lives of prosecutors, will take over
the Wednesday night slot.
   ``Cop Rock,'' the bizarre melding of musical and gritty police
drama got weak ratings despite decent reviews.
   The statement quoted entertainment president Robert Iger as
saying the series' creator, Steven Bochco, ``delivered a daring and
brilliantly produced series, one all of us at ABC are proud to be
associated with.''
   Bochco, who also created ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``L.A. Law,''
called ``Cop Rock'' the most brilliant thing he's ever done.
   ``I've never felt more supported by a network,'' he said. ``The
truth is, I'm not going to go off and pout. I'm not mad at anybody.
We work and live in a very commercial and intensely competitive
world.''
   ``Cop Rock'' made its premiere this fall with a blend of singing
cops, a mayor on the take, an officer who dispensed with a cop
killer by murdering him and a drug addict who sold her baby for a
fix.
   Since its Sept. 26 debut, the series dropped to the bottom third
of the A.C. Nielsen Co. rankings.
   Asked why viewers did not like the show, Bochco said, ``I don't
know. It ain't medicine. If they don't like it, you can't force
them to watch it.''
   The executive producer, who also has the hit comedy ``Doogie
Howser, M.D.'' on ABC, has a development deal with the network for
eight more shows, including an animated, prime-time program for
next year called ``Critters.''
   ``Equal Justice,'' which first aired last season as a midseason
replacement, will return to ABC's schedule on Jan. 9, Iger said
today. The series' executive producer, Thomas Carter, won an Emmy
Award for directing the pilot episode.

of the pro-democracy movement in June 1989.
   The U.S. Embassy refused to release any information about the
delegation except to confirm it was led by Rep. Michael Oxley,
R-Ohio. Oxley's office in Washington said the visit was private.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Sheridan Bell confirmed Xinhua's report
that the members of Congress were in China as guests of the Far
East Studies Institute of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign
Affairs. He refused to provide other details.
   The State Department identified the other four congressmen on
the trip as Reps. Jim Ross Lightfoot, R-Iowa; John J. Rhodes III,
R-Ariz., E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., and George ``Buddy'' Darden,
D-Ga.
   The official news agency Xinhua said Li told the delegation that
China wants improved relations with the United States. The
lawmakers and Li also discussed the Persian Gulf crisis,
developments involving North and South Korea, and the future of
Hong Kong, it said.
   The visit was the lead item on the state-run evening television
news, pointing to the importance placed on it by Chinese officials.
   Washington's relations with Beijing have improved recently, in
large part due to China's cooperation with the United States and
others in the coalition opposing Iraq's Saddam Hussein, who seized
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   U.S.-Chinese ties were badly strained by the 1989 crackdown, in
which the army opened fire on student-led demonstrators urging
democratic reforms. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were
killed.
   The United States and other Western countries halted high-level
visits to China in protest. The ban has not been lifted, but it
applies only to the executive branch and not to members of
Congress.
   President Bush made an exception to the ban when he sent
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft to China for talks, and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has met with Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen outside of China.
   American businessmen, investors and local officials have begun
returning to China, but in numbers far below the pre-crackdown
level.
   Li told the congressional delegation that China continues to
seek better relations with the United States but urged
non-interference in one another's affairs, Xinhua said.
   ``We Chinese should not observe the U.S. From the viewpoint of
our own ideas and norms, while the Americans should not observe
China's affairs according to their views and values,'' Li said.
   Xinhua also reported that a parliamentary delegation from Canada
was visiting Beijing.

<HEAD>Opposition Hits Plan to Allow Lay People to Conduct Funerals</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 14 grafs new with opposition to proposal; picks up 7th

   A wave of opposition arose today to a proposal
before U.S. Roman Catholic bishops that would allow lay people to
conduct funeral services when clergy aren't available.
   A succession of disapproving speeches at a meeting of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops left the plan in doubt.
   Bishop Elden F. Curtiss of Helena, Mont., said such a step would
send a ``wrong signal'' that the church is ``moving from an
ordained to a non-ordained ministry.''
   ``The time when people most want a priest is when they are
dying, at death and afterward,'' he said.
   Results of a ballot vote on the measure were to be disclosed in
late afternoon.
   While a big proportion of the floor debate consisted of
criticism of the proposal, several bishops strongly supported it.
   Archbishop Francis T. Hurley of Anchorage, Alaska, where
``extreme distances'' and ``extreme weather'' accent the need for
lay people conducting funeral rites, said:
   ``It would be corporately narrow-minded and short-sighted not to
allow this provision for the pastoral needs of people at one of
their most poignant moments, the time of death.''
   Under present rules, ordained ministers are required to preside
at funeral litugies, but a worsening shortage of priests has
brought requests that the task be opened to lay persons.
   Of 45 dioceses where there are some Sunday services without
priests, a report said 17 have received requests to let lay people
conduct funerals, and 18 see a pastoral need for it.
   The proposed change would authorize local bishops to permit it
if they choose.
   However, such lay-led services could not include celebration of
Holy Communion, for which priests are required.
   On the second day of their four-day annual fall meeting, the
bishops also weighed moves to straighten out misimpressions given
by some Bible readings in worship.
   Rephrasing of both sexually exclusive and politically
stereotyping connotations were under consideration.
   Among changes proposed for a new lectionary, or cycle of
liturgical Bible readings, were these:
   Replacing ``brothers'' with ``brothers and sisters,'' using
``people'' instead of the generic ``man'' and ``Jewish leaders'' or
``authorities'' instead of the blanket perjorative, ``the Jews.''
   Archbishop John F. Whealan of Hartford, Conn., a Scripture
scholar, said the changes went ``only so far as the original Hebrew
and Greek texts allow.''
   He said the variations were recommended from usages contained in
a Catholic-produced translation, the New American Bible.
   He noted such changes were included in the recently published
New Revised Standard Version, sponsored by the interdenominational
National Council of Churches.
   Like that version, the changes would retain ``Father,'' ``Son''
and ``Holy Spirit'' in describing the trinity, the Christian view
of one God's triune nature.
   ``While God is neither male nor female, the use of the masculine
pronoun may sometimes be preferred in order to be faithful to the
biblical text,'' the proposed document says.
   But it emphasized that words such as ``men,'' ``sons'' and
``brethren,'' once understood as inclusive generic terms, now often
are understood as referring only to males.
   ``Their use has become ambiguous and is increasingly seen to
exclude women,'' the paper says, stressing that words should not be
used ``which deny the common dignity of all the baptized.''
   After calling on the U.S. to exercise restraint to limit
civilian casualties in any military operation in the Middle East,
the bishops slated more discussion of that issue Wednesday.
   But this was to be in a closed-door session as moved by Cardinal
Bernard Law of Boston and approved by a close vote of 126 to 118.
   Several bishops, including two from Alaska, Bishops Michael
Kenny of Juneau and Francis Hurley of Anchorage, urged
unsuccessfully that the discussion be open to the press and other
observers.
   But the closed session may produce a further public statement
about the Persian Gulf situation.
   The bishops' initial joint assessment came in affirming a letter
sent last week by Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles to U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker.
   It condemned Iraq's aggression and ``brutal treatment'' of
civilians and said there was a ``clear need to resist'' it.
   But citing the church's age-old ``just war'' theory, the bishops
said any military operation must be in proportion to ``the evil to
be overcome'' and must rule out tactics targeting civilian
populations.
   It thus would have to be a ``limited war, raising...the price to
be paid,'' the bishops said, urging the U.S. to ``stay the course
of persistent, peaceful and determined'' efforts.

   The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the
appeal of an Ohio legislator being sued for libel because he used
the term ``Mafia'' in opposing the re-election of an
Italian-American to the state's highest court.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Robert E.
Netzley, a Republican member of the Ohio House of Representatives,
must defend himself at trial against a lawsuit by James P.
Celebrezze, the former state court justice.
   In a separate case, the court also refused to kill a libel
lawsuit against Tom Perdue, onetime top aide to Georgia Gov. Joe
Frank Harris.
   In that suit, state Public Service Commission member J. Mac
Barber says Perdue falsely accused of bribery.
   In the Ohio case, Celebrezze was an associate justice of the
Ohio Supreme Court from January 1983 through December 1984. A
Democrat, he was defeated in a 1984 election by Republican Craig
Wright.
   At the time, Celebrezze's brother, Frank D. Celebrezze, was
chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. His cousin, Anthony J.
Celebrezze Jr., was the state's attorney general. Anthony
Celebrezze was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for governor
this month.
   Netzley, chairman of the Miami County Republican Committee,
prepared the campaign pamphlet over which James Celebrezze sued.
   The pamphlet, generally endorsing Republican candidates for
various offices, stated: ``It's no wonder that some are calling
Ohio's Justice System the `Mafia Family' Court. Take a look. Frank
Celebrezze, Chief Justice, Brother Jimmy Celebrezze, Associate
Justice, Cousin Tony Celebrezze, Ohio Attorney General, and Frank
Celebrezze's `Crony' Angelo Gagliardi, intimidator in charge of the
Ohio Disciplinary Council.''
   In his lawsuit, Celebrezze contends that no other person had
ever referred to the Ohio Supreme Court members as a Mafia family
and that Netzley knew none of those mentioned in the pamphlet was
in any way connected with the Mafia or organized crime.
   A state appeals court, ruling that the pamphlet was an
expression of opinion, threw out the suit. But the Ohio Supreme
Court, its ranks bolstered by substitute judges who had no conflict
of interest in the case, voted 5-2 in May to reinstate it.
   The state court said the judge's denial of the dismissal
requests could not be appealed until after a trial was conducted.
   In the Georgia case, the state's Public Service Commission was
the target of a bribery investigation in 1984 and 1985. Barber was
never charged with a crime as a result of that investigation, but
others were indicted.
   Barber resigned from the commission in 1985 but ran in 1986 for
the seat he had left 18 months earlier. He lost to Gary Andrews,
the man appointed to succeed him.
   Barber regained a commission seat in elections this month.
   During the 1986 campaign, Perdue sent a letter to about 350 city
and county officials throughout the state urging them to oppose
Barber's election.
   In the letter, Perdue said: ``A Public Service Commissioner
betrayed the public trust ... by accepting what amounted to a
bribe.''
   The letter added: ``When confronted with the fact that the
attorney general and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation had this
information and were about to seek a felony indictment, Mac Barber
chose to resign his office rather than face the prospect of
indictment and conviction. The trucking company official who gave
Mac Barber the money was convicted and fined a total of $12,000.''
   A state trial judge threw out Barber's suit, ruling that there
was no ``actual malice'' - knowledge or reckless disregard of
falsity. But the Georgia Court of Appeals reinstated the suit by a
5-4 vote last year.

<HEAD>Teacher Accused of 30 Years of Molestations Faces Sentencing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teacher built a reputation of
selflessness and devotion in more than 30 years in this ranching
region. But he also left a legacy of molested male students - some
of whose fathers say he also abused them.
   Douglas Marks, 63, is to be sentenced Wednesday in this Rocky
Mountain community between Helena and Butte, ending a trail of
crime and government inaction that stretches into the 1950s.
   When Marks pleaded guilty July 9 to four counts of felony sexual
assault for molesting four elementary school boys, the fathers of
two of the boys were in the courtroom. Both men said they, too, had
been victims of Marks.
   A Jefferson County sheriff's deputy who received the complaint
that set off the investigation said he had been a victim 25 years
earlier.
   Marks faces up to 20 years on each count.
   Court records cite 22 molestation accusations dating to 1956,
most too old to prosecute. County Attorney Rich Llewellyn says he
has found 45 victims.
   Marks was removed from a teaching job in Boulder in 1959 after
three students accused him of molesting them. He found another
teaching job the next year in Clancy, about 20 miles away, then was
rehired at Boulder Elementary School in 1965.
   In 1984, a young man, Paul Myrhow, came forward against Marks.
It was more than five years before Marks was finally charged and
all four of the offenses to which Marks pleaded guilty occurred
after Myrhow's complaint.
   Many in this ranching-timbering town of 1,400 are quick to
recount Marks' decades of generosity. Two sections of the high
school were dedicated to him, and wall plaques - quietly removed
after his plea - extolled ``his years of service to the
community.''
   Marks' family owns substantial ranch property in the
Helena-Boulder area and a lumber mill in Clancy. A brother, Robert
Marks, was a state legislator from 1969-1989, speaker of the
Montana House in 1981-82 and 1987-88, and Republican leader in
1977-78, 1983-84 and 1985-86.
   Bob Laumeyer, school superintendent from 1970 to 1987, said
Marks made many donations to the school anonymously by reducing his
salary several hundred dollars a year.
   Marks also paid for poor students to take school trips and
attend basketball camps, recalled Dick Nordon, Jefferson County
High School's basketball coach. ``He liked to take students who
didn't get many other chances to experience these things,'' he
said.
   Three victims said that was how Marks found the boys he would
molest.
   The school board has set aside $3,000 and promised more if
necessary to provide counseling for any victims who request it. It
also hired investigators to check allegations that some teachers
and other school officials ignored complaints about Marks.
   The school board forced Marks to take an indefinite leave from
the high school in December 1959 after three students accused him
of molesting them. He and one of the students were living in a
former school dormitory for out-of-town single teachers.
   The Boulder board took Marks back in 1965 because ``he was a
wonderful teacher and highly thought of - even though there were
doubts about his morals,'' said Wahle Phelen, a member of the board
at the time.
   It was 1984 when Myrhow told his former Boy Scout leader, Deputy
Sheriff Daryl Craft, that he had had a homosexual relationship with
Marks for eight years.
   Craft told the Helena Independent Record that he, too, had been
molsted by Marks. Craft said he took Myrhow to Sheriff Tom Dawson,
but nothing happened.
   Dawson and state investigators have refused to comment.
   Myrhow, now 23, went public this summer after Marks pleaded
guilty.
   In June 1989, Myrhow turned to Phillip Pallister, a physician
who had helped force Marks out of Boulder in 1959 - but also had
helped him keep the job at Clancy when some parents protested.
   Pallister said he had learned more about pedophiles by 1989 -
and had discovered that some members of his own family had become
victims of Marks.
   Pressed by Pallister and others, county attorney Llewellyn
called in the state attorney general's office, but discovered
months later that nothing had been done. He hired his own
investigator, a social worker with experience in child-abuse cases,
and filed charges in February.

   Two key Republican senators urged President
Bush today to call a special session of Congress to approve U.S.
military action in the Persian Gulf. The White House rejected the
idea.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't
think that's necessary ... there is no war.''
   Neither Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole nor Sen. Richard Lugar
called for a formal declaration of war against Iraq's Saddam
Hussein.
   But Dole said he wants a ``declaration of support and a
willingness to commit whatever resources it takes to fulfill the
mission.'' Lugar said he wants ``authorization for the president to
act'' and said he was concerned that otherwise, war could break out
because Saddam misunderstood U.S. resolve.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell declared that Bush has no
authority - ``none whatsoever'' - under the Constitution to commit
U.S. forces to war without prior authorization from Congress.
   But he also said Bush is using the latest troop buildup as a
threat, which does not require congressional approval. A special
session of Congress would be justified only if Bush makes a
decision to go to war, Mitchell said.
   ``Obviously no one wishes to conduct a session of Congress
without a clearly defined purpose,'' he said after a closed-door
Democratic caucus meeting dominated by discussion of the gulf. But
he added that Bush's reasons for the new deployment need to be
better explained.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., said, ``My sense is a special
session serves no useful purpose. Without hearing the
administration's policy, we would be debating in a vacuum.''
   Fitzwater said the president believes he has consulted
sufficiently with members of Congress and will continue to do so.
   Fitzwater also dismissed public opinion polls showing declining
public support for Bush's Persian Gulf policy, saying, ``You can't
always make policy by the polls.''
   Asked about Lugar's call for a special session, Fitzwater said,
``The question he raises about a declaration of war is hypothetical
at this point ... It presupposes military action ... a war that we
hope will not occur.''
   Normally, when Congress adjourns for the year it can be called
back into session only by the president. However, anticipating
developments in the gulf, lawmakers this year gave their own
leaders authority to call them back in the adjournment resolution
passed as Congress left town on Oct. 28.
   Bush announced last week he was ordering a massive buildup of
forces in the Persian Gulf to permit offensive operations if
necessary to force Saddam's withdrawal from Kuwait. There are
currently about 230,000 U.S. troops in and around Saudi Arabia and
an additional 200,000 are expected.
   Dole, in an interview, said obtaining congressional support for
the Persian Gulf policy should help build a consensus among the
public for U.S. actions and quiet domestic critics of Bush's
continued deployment of troops.
   ``I think it ought to be put up to the Congress - put up or shut
up. And if they say no, well then, they say no. And then the
president has to decide whether to go it alone,'' the Kansas
Republican said.
   Lugar, R-Ind., former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, told reporters earlier:
   ``I am ... convinced that so long as Saddam Hussein and the rest
of the world has any doubt about the unified resolve of the United
States in this matter, the chances for miscalculation and tragic
mistakes loom much too large.''
   ``I think the president must lay out now to the nation and the
Congress specifically what our aims are,'' he said.
   Lugar said he purposely had avoided using the phrase
``declaration of war'' or mentioning the 1973 War Powers Act. Asked
whether reporters could accurately portray him as wanting a
declaration of war without calling it that, Lugar replied, ``That
is correct.''
   ``What we really want is authorization for the president to
act,'' he said. Lugar said his worst fear is that war could break
out because Saddam misunderstands the U.S. resolve.
   Lugar said he is concerned there has been ``an erosion around
the edges'' among allies for support of U.S. policy in the Gulf.
   While he finds no erosion of support among his constituents,
Lugar said, ``There is a desire to know where we are there ... They
almost are left to their imaginations.''
   After spelling out U.S. goals, Lugar said, Bush ``must call for
a session of the Congress and set a date for the return of the
Congress to debate these issues and vote - affirmatively, I would
presume - so that we have authorization for what is required,''
Lugar said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, agreed that ``the Congress should be involved here.''
   Bush ``has made a fundamental change in policy'' in ordering the
additional troops to the Persian Gulf, Nunn said on the same
program. ``He now is giving the military the role of liberating the
country of Kuwait.''
   ``If there ever is a casebook example of the constitutional
power of Congress to declare war, this is it,'' Nunn said.
   The War Powers Act requires presidential consultation with
Congress and puts limits on troop deployments without direct
congressional authorization if troops are fighting or under
imminent threat of hostilities.
   Also today, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed Nunn and Sen.
John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed Services
Committee.
   Nunn said after the closed-door, Capitol Hill session that the
lawmakers went through a list of country after country in the
coalition against Iraq and questioned each one's level of
involvement.
   Members of Congress have wondered why Egypt, which promised to
deploy a second military division this past summer, has not done so
and why only a limited number of Kuwaiti forces are involved.

   Senate Democrats elected Majority Leader
George Mitchell to a second term today while Wendell Ford was
chosen unanimously for the No. 2 job in the Democratic leadership
ranks.
   Mitchell, of Maine, had no oppositio among the Senate's 56
Democrats. Ford was chosen assistant majority leader after Sen.
David Pryor of Arkansas, who had considered challenging him,
abandoned that plan and was re-elected as secretary to the
Democratic conference.
   Ford, of Kentucky, will replace Alan Cranston of California, who
earlier said he would not seek re-election to the Senate in 1992.
   On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi
was mounting a challenge against Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island,
the incumbent chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, the No.
3 GOP job.
   Like Mitchell, Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas had no
opposition for re-election. Republicans were caucusing later in the
day to select their leadership team.
   In addition to the re-election of Mitchell and Pryor and the
elevation of Ford to the leadership job, the Democrats also
re-elected Sen. Alan Dixon of Illinois as chief deputy whip and
Thomas Daschle of South Dakota as chairman of the Democratic Policy
Committee. They also elected Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia to head
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. All votes were unanimous,
Mitchell said. Democrats now hold 56 of the 100 Senate seats.
   Mitchell described Ford as a ``close friend'' and the new No. 2
leader told reporters he would work closely with the Maine
Democrat, noting that ``1992 will be a critical election year, as
we all know.''
   Ford, 62, who is up for re-election in 1992, has been serving as
chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. He has long coveted the job
that Cranston is vacating. Cranston, in announcing last week that
he would not run for re-election to the Senate, said he was
suffering from prostate cancer and would relinquish his leadership
post.
   Ford is more conservative than Cranston, and consumer activist
Ralph Nader said that means liberals will have to fight harder to
push their agenda in the Senate.
   ``He's pro-tobacco, pro-nuclear, lukewarm on consumers and not
very good on the environment,'' Nader said of Ford. He said the
election of party leaders is crucial because ``you get a guy up
high in the leadership, and it's very important during those crunch
times at the end of a session as to whether you can get legislation
out.''
   Cochran would present a more conservative image in the No. 3
Senate Republican job. He was rated 94 out of 100 by the American
Conservative Union in a ranking of senators on several key votes
through last August, compared with Chafee's 38 rating.
   Bob Billings, executive director of the ACU, said he thought
Cochran ``would be a little more aggressive'' than Chafee in
looking out for conservative interests in the Senate.
   Cochran was re-elected to his third term in the Senate last week
after having served in the House from 1973-78. His effort to win a
leadership position comes amid mounting conservative worries about
the loss of Sens. James McClure, William Armstrong and Gordon
Humphrey, three conservative Republicans who did not seek
re-election.
   ``I think Chafee has been somebody that the conservatives have
tolerated for a long period of time,'' said Republican political
consultant Tom Edmonds. ``I think conservatives have been on hold
for the last two years to wait and see what kind of leadership was
coming out of the White House.''
   But Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Political Report, a
newsletter, said he wasn't sure whether the contest for the No. 3
GOP leadership post was about ideology.
   ``A lot of this has to do with personal campaigning for
(leadership) office,'' he said. ``It says more about the
discussions Republicans have among one another. I'd have trouble
portraying it as merely a right-vs.-left struggle for the heart of
the party.''

   The man who fled with convicted
murderer Lawrencia ``Bambi'' Bembenek to Canada was ordered Tuesday
deported back to the United States, authorities said.
   An adjudicator for the Canadian Immigration Commission in
Thunder Bay ruled that Dominic Gugliatto had worked in Canada
without authorization, thereby he ``ceased to be a visitor,'' said
Steve Csik, a representative of the Minister of Employment and
Immigration.
   Csik presented the case to Adjudicator Bob Murrant during an
hour-long hearing Tuesday at the Thunder Bay Jail.
   Gugliatto will be turned over to authorities at a port of entry
in Minneapolis but officials have yet to set a timetable of when
that would occur.
   Once back in the United States, Gugliatto will face charges of
aiding and abetting Bembenek's escape in Fond du Lac, which is in
southeastern Wisconsin.
   Ms. Bembenek, a former model, Milwaukee police officer and
Playboy club waitress, created a media sensation when she escaped
from the Taycheedah Correctional Institution on July 15. Canadian
police captured her with Gugliatto, her fiance, on Oct. 17.
   The 32-year-old Ms. Bembenek was sentenced to life in prison for
the 1981 murder of her former husband's ex-wife.
   An immigration inquiry for Ms. Bembenek continues later this
month in Thunder Bay, Csik said.

<HEAD>Bush Will Sign Anti-Crime Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, who has attacked the
Democratic-controlled Congress as soft on crime, will sign the
anti-crime bill lawmakers sent to him, the White House said
Tuesday.
   Bush, in recent campaign speeches to bolster Republican
candidates, often accused the Democrats of ``choking'' his
anti-crime package.
   But his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the president
would sign the congressional version, a stripped-down package that
avoided fights over such contentious issues as the death penalty
and a ban on assault weapons.
   ``We think it should have gone further,'' Fitzwater said. ``They
left out some key provisions that we though should have been
included.''
   The House and Senate cut major provisions from the legislation
that Bush had sought as a way of making the measure more
acceptable. That included a provision to permit use of the death
penalty for new categories of federal crimes.
   The bill toughens penalties for certain white-collar crimes
including a possible life prison term in some cases involving fraud
by savings and loan officials.
   It also increases penalties for offenses committed against
children and, for the first time, makes possession of child
pornography a federal offense.

<TEXT>
   The government effort to reunite Beirut
has kindled hope and skepticism about peace prospects in Lebanon
after 15{ years of civil war.
   Optimists contend the new attempt is the first since the war
started in 1975 to be part of a comprehensive peace accord
sponsored by the Arab League and backed by the U.N. Security
Council.
   ``Never before has there been such an international consensus to
resolve the Lebanese conflict,'' said Christian warlord Elie
Hobeika.
   ``The Syrian army is dead serious this time to help Lebanese
troops smother any defiance by any militia,'' said Hobeika, a
staunch ally of Syria.
   Pessimists argue the two previous bids to unite Beirut collapsed
in renewed warfare despite the presence of the Syrian army in 1976
and an international peacekeeping force in 1984.
   ``We hope it will work this time, but frankly what guarantees do
we really have that history won't repeat itself?'' said a
commentary broadcast by Beirut's Voice of the People radio station.
   President Elias Hrawi's government has given the eight major
Moslem and Christian militias 10 days beginning last Saturday to
evacuate Beirut and its suburbs with their weapons.
   All militia commands have publicly pledged to meet the Monday
deadline. Hrawi's troops then are scheduled to conduct a
house-to-house search for weapons that might have been left in
secret hideouts.
   The militia pullout is a key element in the peace plan, which
was brokered by the Arab League and approved by the Lebanese
parliament in a session held in the Saudi town of Taif in September
1988.
   The plan provides for creating a militia-free ``greater Beirut''
as a first step toward restoring government authority over all
Lebanon's territory.
   It also gives the Moslem majority of 55 percent an equal share
of power with the Christians, who dominated the government, army,
parliament and judiciary since Lebanon gained independence from
France in 1943.
   Despite the militia pullout, Hrawi faces the tough task of
getting the private armies to disarm. Also, sectarian suspicions
run deep and not all the warlords are happy about the even
distribution of power.
   The 200,000-strong Druse Moslems, for instance, fear the larger
sects, like the 1.2 million-strong Shiites. The Shiites insist that
as the biggest sect in Lebanon they should have a share of power
befitting their numbers rather than be treated the same as other
sects.
   Many among the Maronite Catholics, the main Christian sect,
deeply resent the Syrians and their allies.
   The peace accord stalled, but it was revitalized when the Syrian
army teamed up with Hrawi's troops to crush Christian Gen. Michel
Aoun's mutiny in Lebanon's Christian heartland Oct. 13.
   The Syrian army entered Lebanon as peace enforcers in July 1976
at the request of Christian leaders, who were losing the war to the
Moslems and their Palestinian guerrilla allies.
   The Arab League later mandated Syria's intervention, stating
that it had prevented the emergence of a PLO-controlled government
in Lebanon that would have provoked Israel to attack its northern
neighbor.
   The Syrians then dismantled the Green Line that had split Beirut
into Moslem and Christian sectors.
   All militias were disbanded and there were much-publicized raids
on their arms hideouts. Newspaper pictures showed senior Syrian
officers alongside heaps of confiscated weapons.
   Beirut's honeymoon lasted 26 months. The Christians, resenting
the Syrians' high-handedness in their neighborhoods, took up arms
to drive them out.
   When the Syrians withdrew from the Christian zone in September
1978 after a 100-day war, the Green Line was restored and Christian
and Moslem militias were again at each other's throats.
   New alliances were forged. Right-wing Christians, struggling to
maintain their Western ties, aligned themselves with Israel.
Left-leaning Moslems and Palestinians, fighting for an Arab
identity, sided with Syria.
   The Israeli army invaded Lebanon in June 1982 to rout Yasser
Arafat's guerrillas from their main Middle East power base.
   In August that year, Israeli-backed Christian militia chieftain
Bashir Gemayel was elected president of Lebanon only to be killed
in a bomb blast three weeks later.
   His vengeful militiamen infiltrated Beirut's Sabra and Chatilla
Palestinian refugee camps, which were surrounded by invading
Israeli troops, and massacred hundreds.
   Outrage over the atrocities prompted the West to dispatch a
multinational force of U.S. Marines, French foreign legionnaires,
Italian Bersaglieri soldiers and British paratroopers to keep peace
in Beirut.
   In December 1982, Beirut's demarcation line was again dismantled
by the western peacekeepers and the city was reunited anew.
   The 5,800-strong Western force angered the Moslems by helping
the mainly Christian Lebanese army establish control in their zone
of the capital.
   On April 15, 1983, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-packed
van into the U.S. Embassy compound in Moslem west Beirut and
detonated it, killing more than 60 people, including 17 Americans.
   On Oct. 23 the same year the U.S. Marine base at Beirut Airport
and the French legionnaires headquarters in the city were
simultaneously truck-bombed, killing 241 American servicemen and 59
Frenchmen.
   The attacks were the beginning of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
terror. Waves of gunpoint kidnappings followed, driving most
Westerners and their embassies out of Beirut's Moslem sector.
   On Feb. 6, 1984, Moslem militiamen again took to the streets and
drove the mainly Christian army under former president Amin Gemayel
out of the Moslem sector.
   The multinational force fled, ending a 17-month unification
experiment. The Green Line was re-established until Hrawi's
government dismantled it again last month.
   ``I think it's more than a prolonged truce but probably not a
lasting peace this time. I dare not be that optimistic,'' said
Gamil Kassem, a Moslem pharmacist.

<TEXT>
   A state clerk's suggestion to use a machine
to count pages may win him $10,000, but it already has cost him his
job.
   George Arroyos of Georgetown is one of seven finalists for the
first prize in the governor's Productivity Suggestion Awards. The
winners are to be announced Thursday.
   His entry explained a way to save money for the Texas Workers
Compensation Commission.
   But the money saved was his own $10,428-a-year salary.
   ``In only four months, I succeeded in eliminating my job,'' he
said, laughing.
   Arroyos said he applied for the job when he graduated from
Angelo State College.
   ``I got hired as a mail opener and page counter,'' he said.
``Whenever anyone needs copies of cases on file, (the agency) has
to print up the copies. My job was to count the number of pages
reproduced and then submit the bill.''
   He said he counted so many pages he thought, ``There has to be a
better way of doing this.'''
   After checking several copier services, Arroyos discovered a $6
page counter that attaches to most copying machines.
   Was he afraid he would lose his job?
   ``The thought did briefly cross my mind,'' he said. ``But then I
thought that if the state saw me as an individual who cared enough
about the taxpayers to suggest eliminating his own job, then there
might be room for me elsewhere.''
   Arroyos was assigned to other duties at the agency before he
resigned to take a job as a probation officer.

   Some mornings, President Bush leads 645
elementary pupils and their teachers in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   ``Good morning to all the students and teachers in school today.
This is George Bush, president of the United States,'' Bush tells
students at Lapel Elementary School.
   The president was among about 35 celebrities principal Jerry R.
Kemerly asked to make tape-recorded messages to lead the pledge.
   Kemerly sent out the requests with blank cassette tapes in
September and has received six responses. Vice President Dan
Quayle, an Indiana native, hasn't responded to his request, Kemerly
said.
   ``I thought it would mean more if the children heard from
influential people or celebrities or athletes,'' he said.
   The school also received tapes from Purdue University basketball
coach Gene Keady, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., and former Brooklyn
Dodger Carl Erskine, now a bank president in Anderson.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Actor Tom Selleck, one of the stars of ``Three

   But he says he hasn't been approached by any of them.
   ``There are a lot of directors I'd like to work with that
haven't exactly rung my phone off the hook,'' he said.
   He says he would be gladly play a small part for a chance to

   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Former Black Panther leader Eldridge
Cleaver paid $500 to retrieve a set of documents he says ``will
tell the story that hasn't been told,'' about the now-defunct
militant group.
   Cartons of Cleaver's books, files and other belongings were
nearly sold by the AAAAA Rent-A-Space company last month for $25.
Cleaver, 55, owed more than $900 in overdue rental fees.
   But the documents were returned to Cleaver on Monday after he
agreed to pay the storage company $500.
   ``This is the most comprehensive collection in private hands of
what the Black Panther Party was up to,'' Cleaver said.
   ``This will tell the story that hasn't been told ... and will be
a vindication of a lot of slander and lies that have been told
about me personally,'' he said.
   Cleaver, one of the founders of the Oakland-based Black Panthers
in 1966, said the items included photographs, papers and pamphlets
documenting the group's activities between 1966 and 1975.
   Cleaver said he will donate them to the Bancroft Library at the

   The Nashville Network's program ``Nashville Now'' sent Hall to

   ``I just told `Nashville Now' that a lot of our men were
leaving,'' Beazley said, adding that many of the 127 soldiers,
including her brother-in-law, had o leave young children behind.
   Hall hosted an 8-minute segment about Crystal Springs, which was

   NEW YORK (AP) - Jilly Rizzo, Frank Sinatra's former personal
road manager, won't go to prison on several bank-fraud convictions
because he is too old and too sick, a judge said Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein sentenced Rizzo, 73, to
five years on each count, but immediately suspended the sentences
and waived thousands of dollars in fines.
   Rizzo, of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and five other men were
convicted in April of operating a scam that led to the 1985
collapse of Flushing Federal Savings and Loan Association.
   Rizzo has maintained his innocence, saying he was manipulated by
con artists seeking to capitalize on his relationship with Sinatra.
   ``The judge was very fair,'' Rizzo said after the sentencing.
   The lawyer said Rizzo has a degenerative back disorder and
problems with his knees.

   More than 900 students held a
rally today for classmate Stormie Jones, the world's first
heart-liver transplant recipient, who died at the age of 13.
   ``Stormie would want all of us to remember her for who she
was,'' said Chere Bourland, also 13, who knew Stormie for two
years. ``And I think what Stormie wanted us to learn from her is to
be proud of what we have, whether we have everything we want or
not, and be proud that you are well and alive.''
   She was answered by a deafening roar from the 940 students in
grades 6-8 at Brewer Middle School in this Fort Worth suburb.
   Stormie died Sunday at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Lab
tests to determine what caused her sudden death will take up to two
weeks to complete.
   Paulette Lane, the school's vice principal, said a live oak tree
was planted Monday in front of the school in Stormie's remembrance.
   The flag flew at half-staff at Brewer, which Stormie attended
for a few weeks in the fall before being forced home by medical
problems. Students voted to name the gymnasium after Stormie.
   The student council also decided to hang a portrait of the
seventh-grader in the hall.
   ``They decided to dedicate the school yearbook to her, to
collect donations all week for her medical bills instead of sending
flowers,'' said student council sponsor Connie Massey.
   A marker will be added where the oak was planted in front of the
school, Principal Homer Dear said.
   ``She liked to do things for other people,'' said Crystal
Millikan, 13, Stormie's best fried. ``If you felt bad, she would
make your day by saying something funny to cheer you up or by
giving a gift and saying, `I love you.'''
   ``She was always happy and outgoing,'' said Steven Beam, 12.
``She never made fun of anybody.''
   Stormie was 6 when she became the first person to receive a
transplanted heart and liver at the same time. She received a
second liver transplant in February.
   Stormie on Saturday night was flown with a sore throat and high
fever to the Pittsburgh hospital, which had performed the
transplants. Her condition deteriorated rapidly.
   Dr. Jorge Reyes, staff physician at Children's Hospital, said
preliminary autopsy results were inconclusive.

   The pungent odor of marijuana wafting

   Roseville police Lt. Joel Neves said Monday that the aroma came
from a small bundle of cash that was traced to Ann Patwell, 32, and
her husband, Wayne Patwell, 34.
   The money had been deposited Wednesday, Neves said.
   Officers executed a search warrant at the Patwell home in nearby

   U.S. Marines will conduct their first
amphibious assault exercise in Saudi Arabia since being deployed to
the Persian Gulf, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams declined to say where
in Saudi Arabia the exercise would be held or when it would start.
   The Washington Times reported that the exercise would be 10
miles from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and quoted unnamed U.S. officials
as saying it was ``provocative'' to hold the maneuvers that close
to the border.
   ``I don't see how you could in any way describe them as
provocative,'' Williams said about the maneuver. ``This is Saudi
sovereign territory. It isn't like parts of the country have
already been red-lined away. It's all Saudi Arabia that we are
talking about.''
   He said amphibious exercises were an essential part of Marine
training and that two had been conducted since U.S. forces were
sent to the gulf in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
Those exercises were held in Oman, farther from the Kuwait border.
   Williams said more than one of the armed services would be
involved in the exercise and there other countries might be
involved. He said details would be announced later in the week.

   A U.S. warship fired warning shots across the
bow of a Sudanese freighter last week and sent men aboard when it
refused to stop, but the vessel was empty and was allowed to
proceed, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Pete Williams said the cargo ship Umdurman was
intercepted in the northern Red Sea on Thursday by the Greek
frigate Elli as part of enforcement of the embargo on shipments to
Iraq.
   When the Umdurman did not respond to an order to stop, the Greek
frigate fired warning shots. The Sudanese vessel still did not
stop.
   The Elli was then joined by the Spanish frigate Cazadora and the
U.S. guided missile cruiser Philippine Sea.
   The Philippine Sea fired 50-caliber and 5-inch shots across the
Umdurman's bow. Williams said he did not know how many.
   The Umdurman was then boarded by helicopter. The boarding party
was joined by additional personnel from the Elli and the Philippine
Sea.
   Williams said the Sudanese vessel was allowed to proceed after
it was found to be empty. He said he did not know why the vessel's
captain failed to stop.
   Williams said there have been 3,592 intercepts since the embargo
was imposed in August. There have been 412 boardings, and 16 ships
have been diverted.

<TEXT>
   The deadline for filing claims under the
National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has been extended,
federal officials said Tuesday.
   Congress moved the deadline to Jan. 31 for claimants injured on
or before Oct. 1, 1988. The earlier deadline had been Oct. 1, 1990.
   Those who miss the deadline may pursue their claims in civil
court, but the federal program was set up as a faster, less
expensive procedure.
   The program pays compensation for vaccine-related injuries,
requiring petitioners to prove only that the injury is related to a
vaccine, not that the manufacturer of the vaccine was at fault.
   It covers the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine; the
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine; the oral polio vaccine; and the
inactivated polio vaccine, said the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   Claims for injuries that occurred after Oct. 1, 1988, must be
filed by deadlines stipulated in the National Childhood Injury Act.
   The amount of compensation is determined by a U.S. Claims Court
based on the needs of the injured person and the extent of the
injury. The maximum death benefit is $250,000.
   Information about how to file a petition may be obtained from
the U.S. Claims court, 717 Madison Place N.W., Washington, D.C.,
20005. The department's Health Resources and Services
Administration toll-free hotline is 800-338-2382.

   NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe praised
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday as a courageous
man of vision, but said he still had some concerns about Soviet
military might.
   U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin told a news conference he was
optimistic Gorbachev's reforms would succeed, and said he received
indications Soviet military production was easing.
   Both Galvin and Norwegian Gen. Vigleik Eide, chairman of NATO's
military committee, said they were confident a treaty reducing
conventional forces in Europe would be signed in Paris later this
month, and that it would form the basis for further cuts.
   Galvin said after meeting Gorbachev on Tuesday: ``I came away
from that feeling that I had seen a man of courage and a man of
vision.''
   ``There is no doubt that the road ahead for the Soviet Union is
rocky and difficult, but I personally think, for what that's worth,
that it's the right road,'' Galvin said. ``I'm upbeat. I'm
optimistic.''
   Galvin and Eide arrived in the Soviet Union on Sunday, guests of
Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov. It was the first such visit by
high-ranking military officials of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   ``Our presence here must be seen as a clear demonstration of the
changing times,'' Eide said. He said the two generals had ``very
open and productive conversations'' with their Soviet counterparts.
   Eide refused to comment on reports of a last-minute hitch in
negotiations for the conventional forces treaty, scheduled to be
signed by 22 nations on Nov. 19.
   ``We know that there have been some last-minute negotiations,''
he said. ``That is normal and that should be expected. I am
confident, and I also sense the feeling here, that we will have a
(conventional forces) agreement signed in a few days time.''
   Galvin, asked whether Soviet tanks and other heavy arms have
been moved east across the Ural Mountains out of reach of the
European treaty, said he was concerned about such reports but not
sufficiently to ``raise enough flags'' to scuttle the treaty.
   ``I have been provided ... with some interesting and in my view
partially satisfying answers,'' he said.
   Galvin also said he received ``indications'' from Soviet
officials that production of military equipment was decreasing.
   ``I see some important changes here in terms of the possible
turndown of production and I think it is what's going to happen,''
he said.
   ``I think there will still be enough production in the Soviet
Union to provide for a high-quality force. ... I am concerned with
the overall size even after (the agreement).''
   Eide said there was broad East-West agreement to resume
conventional arms control talks in Vienna after the conventional
forces treaty was signed, aimed at ``deeper cuts in the present
equipment categories, maybe identifying other categories and also
... the question of manpower.''
   The treaty would limit the number of tanks, artillery pieces,
armored combat vehicles, aircraft and helicopters that NATO and the
Warsaw Pact could maintain in Europe.

   A Coast Guard cutter was en route
Tuesday to a 635-foot Chinese freighter taking on water in an area
of shoals about 400 miles northwest of Honolulu.
   The Mei Gui Hai, with a crew of 39 and 39,000 pounds of barium
sulfate, had three hull fractures and had been taking on water for
seven days, said Chief Ed Moreth at the headquarters of the 17th
Coast Guard District in Juneau.
   The 180-foot buoy tender Firebush, which was on its way back to
Alaska after training exercises in Hawaii, was diverted Monday to
help the ship at French Frigate Shoals, about 420 miles northwest
of Honolulu, the Coast Guard said. It was expected to reach the
scene Wednesday.
   A Honolulu salvage tug, the Tillamook, and the freighter Lucky
Field were standing by near the Chinese vessel in case their help
was needed, said Coast Guard Lt. Kent Youel in Honolulu.
   It was not immediately know where the Mei Gui Hai was bound
when it began taking on water, or its home port. Its cargo is a
powdered mineral with various uses, including paper coatings,
plastics and linoleum. It also is used as a contrast medium for
X-rays.
   The vessel anchored in a shelter near the shoals to escape bad
weather, officials said.
   ``They were experiencing up to 35 knot winds, gusting to 40,''
said Youel. ``They tucked in to get out of the weather and to make
some repairs.''
   There was no indication that the ship had leaked any of its
load, Youel said. He did not know the cause of the hull fractures,
and said pump crews from the Tillamook were keeping up with
flooding.
   When the weather improves, the Chinese ship will leave the
protection of the shoals and head for Honolulu, Youel said.

   The World Bank said Tuesday its president will
visit the Soviet Union, the first such trip in the bank's 45-year
history.
   Barber Conable, who leaves Wednesday, will spend two days in
Moscow to study the possibility of allowing the Soviet Union to
become a member of the World Bank.
   The Soviet Union is one of the few countries that doesn't belong
to the 154-member bank and its sister organization, the
International Monetary Fund. The United States, which has the
largest voting power in the bank, has opposed Soviet membership.
   Some have questioned whether the Soviet Union will remain a
united country, with a single currency and one central bank.
   The World Bank lends more than $21 billion a year to the Third
World, but the Soviet Union gets nothing.
   ``The talks are expected to include a discussion of the Soviet
request for technical assistance and issues relating to the
possibility of the Soviet Union joining the World Bank,'' the World
Bank said in a statement announcing Conable's trip.
   Conable, the statement said, will explore ways that the bank can
help the Soviets move toward a market economy.
   Conable will meet with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
other leaders. He was invited by Viktor V. Gerashchenko, chairman
of the State Bank of the USSR.
   Gerashchenko led the Soviet delegation that attended the annual
joint meetings in September of the bank and the IMF.
   The bank, the IMF and two other international organizations are
making a joint study of the Soviet economy. IMF manging director
Michel Camdessus already has visited Moscow.
   China has been one of the bank's biggest borrowers, getting
about $2 billion a year until the suppression of the movement for
democracy in June 1989.
   Since then the United States has said loans should go only for
basic human needs and the total has been considerably smaller -
$865 million the past 16 months.

<HEAD>DOE Asserts It Has Power To Operate Shoreham Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secretary of energy has the authority to
operate New York's inactive Shoreham nuclear power plant in the
event of an energy emergency, the department contends in a brief
filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The DOE gave no indication that it intended to try to employ
this authority. The department did not immediately return a phone
call Tuesday seeking comment.
   ``Obviously, the use of this authority is one of the options
available to the secretary depending on the course of events both
in the Middle East and in this country as those events affect the
local, regional or national energy supply and security,'' DOE said
in a brief filed Nov. 9.
   Its definition of energy emergency included ``sudden increases
in consumer demand (and) inability to obtain adequate amounts of
fuel.''
   Joseph McDonnell, a spokesman for the Long Island Lighting Co.,
which built Shoreham, said Tuesday it was ``highly debatable
whether the federal government has the authority to order the
operation of the Shoreham plant.''
   The statutes the DOE has cited ``never contemplated a situation
where a state government had decided to close the plant down,''
McDonnell said from Hicksville, N.Y.
   LILCO has agreed never to operate Shoreham and to sell the plant
for a symbolic $1 to New York state. The state plans to
decommission the plant and find some means to replace the 800
megawatts of energy Shoreham could have generated. The deal capped
years of bitter debate before the NRC.
   But after George Bush was elected president, the Energy
Department began a public relations campaign to stop Shoreham's
decommissioning. Energy Secretary James Watkins asked that Shoreham
be kept intact and ready to operate, on the assumption that public
opinion would eventually turn in favor of the plant.

   Before committing U.S. troops to battle
against Iraq, President Bush must do a better job convincing the
American people of the need for a Persian Gulf war, political
analysts say.
   ``I don't think we've done a very good job in the administration
of explaining to the American people in depth what this is all
about,'' said Lance Tarrance, a Republican pollster based in Texas.
   ``We learned from Vietnam that Americans have to be convinced
and sold on a rationale for our involvement,'' said Neil Newhouse,
a pollster with the Republican firm headed by Richard Wirthlin.
   War worries swept Washington the past week after Bush announced
a substantial increase in the U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf. The announcement also triggered speculation on the impact
that hostilities would have on the 1992 presidential election.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Wendell Ford seems assured of the No. 2
spot in the Democratic leadership as the two parties organize in
the Senate for the start of the 102nd Congress in January.
   The way was cleared for Ford's selection to succeed Sen. Alan
Cranston as the Democratic whip after Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas
abandoned plans to challenge the Kentucky Democrat, who won
election to a third term last week.
   On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi
was mounting a challenge against Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island,
the incumbent chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, at
party organizing caucuses scheduled for today.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine and Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas had no challengers. Nor was there any
opponent for Assistant GOP Leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Army overcharged its personnel for
temporary lodging and diverted the money to projects like the
renovation of a VIP house and two custom throw rugs costing $3,600,
congressional investigators say.
   The General Accounting Office, in reviewing the daily fees
assessed to soldiers staying at special housing during training,
found that from 1985 to 1989, two Army commands amassed more than
$70 million from inflated charges assessed against the per diem
allowance given soldiers.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated that the
amount could rise to more than $100 million after calculating
figures for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   ``Some Army installations have overcharged soldiers for
transient lodgings and ... used the proceeds to subsidize Morale,
Welfare and Recreation activities - officers' clubs, golf courses,
arts and crafts facilities and lodging for visitors,'' the GAO said
in a report released last week.

   DALLAS (AP) - Buildups of artery-clogging fatty deposits that
can cause heart attacks may result when a person's defense system
turns against the body, researchers say.
   Dr. William Hollander of Boston University said his latest
research supports the theory he pioneered two decades ago: that
hardening of the arteries is an autoimmune disease, in which the
body mistakenly destroys itself.
   The theory has become a hot topic of research in recent years as
doctors try to identify the forces that cause blood vessels to fill
up with fatty deposits like rust-encrusted pipes.
   This process, which doctors call atherosclerosis, results in a
heart attack or stroke if a clot accidentally squeezes off the flow
of blood.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - American savings and loans might seem like
the last place the Soviet Union would look for advice on how to
finance its fledgling private housing market.
   But Valery P. Sorokin, a Soviet Foreign Ministry economist and
diplomat, is enthusiastically pumping executives at the 98th annual
convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions for
everything he can learn.
   ``We want to avoid the extremes ... the bad side of this whole
business. ... But we want to take the best that you have to
offer,'' Sorokin said in an interview Monday.
   The Soviet Union has embarked on a 500-day program to transform
its communist economy into something approaching the free-market
system found in Western countries.

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - With the fear of Soviet aggression no
longer serving as glue, the U.S.-Pakistan relationship is
threatening to come apart under the strain of frictions over
Pakistan's nuclear program, diplomats say.
   Congress and the new government of Pakistan appear ready to walk
away from the four-decades-old relationship that served as a
cornerstone of U.S. policy in South Asia and gave Washington an
important friend in the Moslem world.
   In October, the United States demanded that Islamabad reverse
its nuclear program and froze $573 million of economic and military
assistance to Pakistan, part of a six-year, $4-billion aid package
begun in 1987.
   After winning elections last month by capitalizing on growing
resentment of U.S. influence in this Moslem country of 110 million,
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and his right-wing coalition have
declared they can do without U.S. aid.

   HELENA, Mont. (AP) - This winter, Yellowstone rangers - charged
with the protection of the park's animals - may be shooting them,
instead.
   Their quarry are bison who leave the park's valleys in search of
food in Montana, bringing with them brucellosis, a disease that
causes cattle to abort their calves. Montana game wardens and
private hunters have been killing these strays; this year,
Yellowstone rangers plan to join them.
   And animal rights groups say they plan to fight it.
   ``They're treating the nation's last free-roaming bison herd as
some sort of expendable cattle,'' said Wayne Pacelle, national
director of the Fund for Animals in New York. He pledged a ``direct
action presence'' at any hunt.
   ---&equals;
   MARTINSBURG, W.Va. (AP) - Mayor Anthony Senecal has his hand out
to panhandlers, hoping a proposed $50-a-year licensing fee will
persuade them to move on.
   ``I've always been appalled that people who come downtown to
shop are always being asked, `Have you got 25 cents? Have you got
50 cents?''' Senecal said. ``That's bull. It isn't right. Pretty
soon they're going to stop coming downtown to shop.''
   Senecal wants to require panhandlers to buy a $25 license every
six months. Violators could get a $500 fine and 10 days in jail.
   City Council is scheduled to consider the ordinance Thursday.

   Students, teachers and administrators, they
say it over and over again, they write it, they shout it:
   Dartmouth College is not the Dartmouth Review.
   For 10 years, Dartmouth College has been portrayed as a theater
of war - a battlefield of racism, sexism and political intrigue,
all reflected in the activities of the obstreperous, right-wing
Review.
   The Review has dominated national news coverage of Dartmouth,
but interviews with faculty members and a broad spectrum of
students indicate that they believe their school has been shown in
a false light.
   ``My experience has been that there is no one here that is
overtly prejudiced, that is overtly racist, that is overtly
sexist,'' says junior Mindy Waterhouse, a founder of a campus
women's group and an intern at a college-run clearinghouse on
women's lifestyle issues.
   The Review - a student-run publication unaffiliated with the Ivy
League college - is nothing if not overt.
   On Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in 1986, Review staff
members used sledgehammers to tear down shanties erected on the
campus green by apartheid protesters. In August, music Professor
William Cole, who is black, resigned, citing the strain of years of
Review attacks.
   The publicity has taken its toll. Alfred Quirk, admissions and
financial aid dean, says black enrollment is down a bit this year,
from 6 percent to 5 percent of the incoming class of 1,067. He
blames the Review contretemps.
   In September, a quote from Adolf Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' was
inserted in the masthead of the Review edition circulated on the
Jewish holy day Yom Kippur. The Review blames a saboteur and has
Hanover police investigating.
   Whatever the source, it was a campus call to arms.
Administrators and students denounced the Review, and 2,500 people
rallied.
   ``I was heartened beyond words at the warm, loving response of
Dartmouth students,'' said senior Allen Drexel, chairman of the
Dartmouth Area Gay and Lesbian Organization.
   ``I think that Dartmouth students who have gone silent for a
long time with regard to the Review's attacks on vulnerable social
groups were able to collectively absolve themselves of past
neglect.''
   Apathy or fear of disrupting the status quo - not pervasive
bigotry - is to blame for the atmosphere in which the Review has
flourished, Drexel said.
   ``I would say Dartmouth students, rather than being conservative
in any partisan sense, ... are conservative in the sense of
reluctance to rock the boat,'' Drexel said. ``In a system that
seems to work for them, why even think about changing things?''
   The Review also flourishes because of support from prominent
conservatives like columnist Pat Buchanan and former Treasury
Secretary William Simon, who has written that college
administrators are persecuting the paper and its staff.
   Conservative alumni also contribute funds to the Review. Some
see it as a hedge against liberal forces that have forced the
rewording of the alma mater, ``Men of Dartmouth,'' and the
abandonment of the school mascot, an Indian.
   ``Our perception of tradition today is different from what
tradition was in the past,'' said student Brian Pierce. ``Now we
have women on campus, now we have native Americans who are against
having the symbol because it's offensive to them.
   ``Tradition should be kept if it enhances the Dartmouth
experience now, but if it detracts from it, there's no point in
clinging to tradition.''
   Dartmouth's defenders do not deny that prejudice exists on
campus.
   ``I would say that Dartmouth is a frightening place to be gay to
the same extent that the country is a frightening place,'' Drexel
said. ``The institution isn't perfect. I think everybody will
freely admit that.''
   Trecia Canty, a senior and president of the Afro-American
Society, said she has at times felt ``distinctly uncomfortable'' as
a black student.
   She said the Review's attacks on music Professor Cole in her
freshman year made the whole black community feel under fire.
   ``At the time I perceived it (as moving from) his credibility
and qualifications as a professor being questioned to all the
qualifications of all African-Americans, faculty and students
alike, being questioned,'' she said.
   But Canty considers the occasional ``insensitive comment'' made
in her presence ``more the result of ignorance ... than actual
intent to be hurtful.''
   And blacks like English Professor William Cook credit Dartmouth
with fighting intolerance, especially under college President James
O. Freedman.
   Cook attributed Dartmouth's problems at least partly to its
location in a small town on the border between two predominantly
white states, Vermont and New Hampshire.
   ``What happens on this campus with respect to race is more
important because there is no larger black community,'' he said.
``That's why we're getting all the attention. The same things
happen on other campuses.''
   The ultimate question for female, minority and gay students and
faculty members is whether they would recommend Dartmouth to others
like themselves.
   ``I definitely would,'' Cook said. ``We need that critical mass
of people to constitute a community.''
   Drexel said that while he is glad he came to Dartmouth, it was
hard.
   ``In retrospect, I know my college experience at a place like
Yale or Harvard or another urban institution would have been a lot
less challenging as regards to my orientation,'' he said.
   ``However, the challenges of coming to grips with my identity at
Dartmouth have without question made me a stronger person.''

<TEXT>
   In this city, where favorable laws, lawyers
and cooperative doctors can make insurance fraud a popular sport,
Douglas Collins' story is typical. To a point.
   On Jan. 20, 1984, Collins crawled up the steps of his South
Philadelphia home in obvious pain. He told his wife he had been
hurt as he pushed a woman's car out of the snow and wooden blocks
under the tires shot out and hit him.
   That part was true. Doctors treated him for fractures in his
neck and legs and gave him a neck collar and crutches.
   The next day, Collins left the crutches and collar at home, got
on a bus and at one of the stops, threw himself out the door. At
the hospital, he laughed as he told his wife he was a ``good
actor,'' she later recalled.
   He sued the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority,
which agreed to a $25,000 settlement.
   Then his wife, by now estranged, called SEPTA with the real
story.
   Last month, Collins was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison
- a kind of poster child for SEPTA's full-court press against
fraud.
   ``They think they can make a living this way. Everyone - the
claimant, the doctors, the lawyers, everyone,'' said Eileen Katz,
deputy counsel for SEPTA. ``And the culture, the fabric and makeup
of Philadelphia, supports it.''
   SEPTA, which runs the city's trains, buses and trolleys, charges
a base fare of $1.50, highest in the country.
   It paid $47 million in claims in fiscal 1990, or 17.7 percent of
the amount collected in fares, a percentage well above other
big-city rates.
   ``We are, if not the worst area, one of the worst in the
country'' for insurance fraud, said James Kilcur, SEPTA's chief
counsel.
   Pennsylvania law puts few obstacles in the way of someone who
wants to make a claim, and all claims under $25,000 go before an
arbitration panel within eight months.
   ``It's a good system for moving cases but it's also a system
that makes it easy for the people who make claims,'' Kilcur said.
``We also have a lot of lawyers who do this kind of work here, and
we have a lot of doctors who treat these people, and physical
therapists, and psychiatrists.
   ``It gets a life of its own after a while,'' he said. ``Everyone
is making money in the system here, and in SEPTA's case we're an
easy target.''
   So SEPTA is fighting back.
   - Earlier this month, SEPTA won a state Supreme Court case
challenging a state law that limits liability to $250,000 per
person or $1 million per accident.
   - ``Guess who's stealing part of your fare?'' asks one of the
billboards erected as part of the agency's anti-fraud campaign,
started in 1989. It shows a man in a neck brace carrying a sack of
money. ``File a false claim and you could go to jail,'' says
another.
   The campaign includes radio spots and cards in buses and subway
cars. The ads also run in publications read by doctors and lawyers.
   - The authority has built an elaborate system to ferret out
fraud. A line has been set up for phone tips, computers check for
repeat claimants, and video surveillance is used to see if alleged
victims are really injured.
   SEPTA tells its investigators to look for telltale signs of
fraud - a bus or train crash that makes the news usually means a
rush of shaky claims; unemployed men between 22 and 35 are most
likely to file false claims.
   Someone who is vague or wrong on details - like the woman who
had a train going the wrong way - is eyed suspiciously. In one
case, when a car crashed into a bus with no passengers, 11 people
filed suit claiming injury.
   After an accident, SEPTA sends its investigators out quickly to
record the names of the injured. A subway crash in April that
killed four has attracted 278 claims, far more than the number of
people SEPTA says were on board. Some of the claims were filed
about five months after the crash.
   ``You'd think people would have realized by now if they were on
the train and were injured,'' Kilcur said.
   About 40 percent of all claims are closed without payment.
   SEPTA says new claims dropped from 13,005 in fiscal 1989 to
10,355 in fiscal 1990. Eight people have been convicted of fraud in
the last two years; most got fines and probation, though a doctor
who submitted fake medical reports was sentenced to prison.
   ``It's pretty early on in the game, but the campaign is pretty
active and we are seeing a noticeable decrease'' in claims, Katz
said.
   Edward S. Chacker, a lawyer and vice president of the
Philadelphia Trial Lawyers Association, insists the vast majority
of claims are legitimate.
   ``No one wants bad claims - lawyers, doctors or SEPTA,'' Chacker
said.
   Chacker and Katz said SEPTA and the association are working
together to fight bad claims. SEPTA says it will establish a phone
line, for instance, so lawyers can call to see if a client is
listed by SEPTA as having been on a certain bus or train.
   ``Trial lawyers are trying to work it out, trying to get rid of
the trash,'' Chacker said.

<TEXT>
   Today is Wednesday, Nov. 14, 1990, a day that
with luck may slip through the clutches of ``Instant Recall,'' a
syndicated half-hour of television history.
   That oxymoron aside, nothing much happens in today's show,
despite the flashy, neonized set and lots of sleek, zoomy graphics
that include a chrome octahedron with the show's logo.
   Zoomy graphics do not a documentary make. ``Instant Replay'' is
an attempt to evoke our memories of the recent past with video
footage from critical moments in our recent history.
   It tries to give us that by installing solid, trusted newsreader
John Palmer, formerly news anchor of the ``Today'' show, as anchor
and sometime interviewer of the show.
   The pace is blistering.
   Today's show opens with a look back at Feb. 12, 1955. Why Feb.
12, 1955, you say?
   Because that's the night James Dean returned to his hometown of
Fairmont, Ind., after the premiere of ``East of Eden,'' the only
one of the actor's movies to be released while he was alive. Seven
months later, he was dead.
   There's an interview with Dean's college roommate, an interview
with Dean's high school drama teacher, and Martin Landau talks
about his old buddy.
   And there are lots of still pictures of Dean in Fairmont, Ind.
   Yes, but what happened on Feb. 12, 1955?
   Oh. Well. Nothing, really. It was a publicity stunt. Dean went
to a high school gathering and showed off for his old classmates.
End of story. End of segment.
   If you're not already stunned by the profligate waste of a good
topic, then you'll be anguished and appalled by the next segment,
which revisits Oct. 6, 1981, and the assassination of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat by Moslem extremists.
   Not even Palmer can emerge unscathed from this line that the
writers foist upon him:
   ``The Middle East, the cradle of civilization, is still nursing
ancient hatreds that haunt us to this day.''
   Whew!
   That would be almost forgivable, if the producers fulfilled the
premise of syndicated ``reality'' programs: Go for the viewers' hot
buttons.
   Palmer does a nice, quiet interview with Sadat's widow. Jihan,
who has become famous in her own right as a lecturer and teacher
who obtained a much-publicized $200,000 teaching stint at the
University of South Carolina.
   She relives the day of her husband's assassination, which was
televised to the world. Her composure is admirable, but the
videotape does little to relive the horror we experienced on that
day.
   Video footage and still pictures - for some reason excised from
the ``Instant Recall'' version - showed Sadat's submachine gun
killers at point-blank range, spraying the reviewing stand where he
lay dead or dying.
   It was a singular image of fanatic, brutal ferocity that would
help to explain the depth of those ``ancient hatreds'' - or
titillate a syndication audience nine years later. And yet,
inaccountably, it is missing.
   The final segment on ``Instant Recall'' takes us to Detroit in
1964, for the disintegration of the Supremes (Of course, you
remember where you were!) - a time that will live in infamy.
   And it closes with a still picture and passing mention that four
years ago today, Nov. 14, 1986, inside trader Ivan Boesky was fined
$100 million for his transgressions. There is no footage, no
followup. It's just there.
   ``Instant Recal not made by wicked people with evil
motives; nevertheless, it is an insidious program.
   It seems to include only the memories of anyone born after 1950,
perhaps because older TV recordings don't have the video quality
needed to support the show.
   Television is great for events, but it doesn't lend itself to
history. It gives us a single perspective, or a series of single
perspectives, onto an event.
   History is the weaving together of multiple viewpoints into a
coherent account of what was. ``Instant Recall'' is an incoherent
mess.
   If ``Instant Recall'' had the intellectual wherewithal to stick
with one subject and cover it in detail, it might be worth
watching. As it is, today's show concludes with the No. 1 hit of
Nov. 14, 1986, and a crushing irony:
   It was Robert Palmer singing, ``I Didn't Mean to Turn You On.''

<HEAD>A Layman's Guide to What's Happening on ``Twin Peaks''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Good evening, class. Welcome to ``Understanding
Twin Peaks,'' a one-night course we've giving because the
instructor of the usual class has croaked.
   If memory serves, his class is about TV criticism and is called
``Depth Perception is a Myth.''
   Anyhow, that fits right into tonight's class, because they've
asked me to bring you up to speed on the latest developments in
``Twin Peaks.''
   What's ``Twin Peaks''? Well, miss, it's a surreal and even
unconventional ABC series by David Lynch and Mark Frost.
   Who is David Lynch? Good question, sir. Can I get back to you on
that?
   Now, just for the record, how many people in this class have
seen ``Twin Peaks''? Thank you, sir. Uhhh, sir, please don't eat
your donut in class.
   In case the rest of you haven't seen ``Twin Peaks,'' it's set in
a Pacific Northwest logging town. There, a high school homecoming
queen has been murdered. Her name is Laura Palmer.
   What's that, sir? You say the series is more than just a series?
You say it's richly textured, riveting television, a uniquely
non-linear Lynchian vision of the dark underbelly of Americana?
   Well, I guess so. But you've got to remember, I'm just subbing
for the teacher who croaked, and to tell the truth, I don't watch
``Twin Peaks'' much. Sure wish they gave me some Cliff Notes on it.
   Anyhow, as I understand it, ``Twin Peaks'' is the sort of show
where a giant pops up now and then and says things like, ``The owl
has to go to the bathroom.''
   Or maybe it's the Log Lady, who carries around a log. As I
understand it, she is a cousin of Zamfir, the wood flute guy. She
plays the log and just cut a CD called ``Log Lady Plays `What Now
My Love' Just for You.''
   Occasionally, a white horse shows up and hangs around the living
room, or so I'm told. And then there is a Sheriff Harry S. Truman,
who is no relation to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   But the sheriff is adopted, or so I'm told.
   Anyhow, I tuned in ``Twin Peaks'' last Saturday night because
ABC said the show would reveal who killed Laura Palmer. They'd
promised this twice before, but they couldn't get David Lynch to
write it.
   Well, class, the show opened with a bunch of Navy guys bouncing
rubber balls in a lodge. Then a bearded guy in the lodge had a
seizure. Then someone was found hanging from a rope. He killed
himself.
   Apparently, the poor guy couldn't figure out ``Twin Peaks.''
   After that, a guy named Leo in a wheelchair sort of burped. He
also drooled and said, ``New shoes.''
   I am not sure what happened next. There was a blinding flash of
light and and a tall, gaunt man appeared and said in this big,
booming voice: ``I ... am ... PRETENTIOUS.''
   The vision continued. An owl appeared and said, ``The Log Lady
is all bark and no ... oh, never mind.'' Then came Andy, a
sheriff's deputy. He began crying and saying, ``I'm stuck in a dumb
series.''
   And then Laura Palmer herself appeared.
   ``It's not clear who killed me,'' she said.
   Then, class, the vision faded to black. When I came to, the real
show was over.
   So, to prepare for tonight's course, I called ABC and said I'd
had a vision during last Saturday's ``Twin Peaks'' and somehow
missed the part where they revealed the killer of Laura Palmer.
   I asked if they could tell me who killed her.
   They told me they weren't releasing that information until last
Saturday's show was over. They said they didn't really know when it
would end.
   I forget who was speaking. But I could have sworn she also said,
``Get a log.''

   PALEY AND CBS - THE SEQUEL: HBO Pictures is going to start
production next year on ``Paley,'' a miniseries about the life and
times of CBS founder William S. Paley, who died last month at the
age of 89. No one has been named yet to play the late CBS chairman.
   The show will be based on Sally Bedell Smith's ``In All His
Glory,'' a new biography of Paley, and marks the second time that
HBO has dramatized the life of a major CBS figure. Its first effort
was about Edward R. Murrow.

<HEAD>Loose Credit Sinks Economies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans really are up to their necks in debt,
and more people than ever before are sinking even deeper toward
financial suffocation and bankruptcy.
   Americans owe money to banks, finance companies, credit unions,
pension funds, retailers, gasoline companies, foreigners. They owe
on cars, homes, farms and their very lives, the latter by borrowing
on insurance policies.
   They even owe money to future generations by allowing government
to run up debts they can never repay, and that will be passed on to
those not yet born. Sadly, much of the money was for frivolous
rather than meaningful items.
   Americans owe money personally and institutionally, the former
through such means as credit cards and the latter through debts run
up by federal, state and local governments, and by companies in
which they hold stocks or bonds.
   It is a crush of bad loans - to Third World countries, real
estate developers and big-time thieves - that underlies the demise
of financial institutions, such as commercial banks, savings banks
and thrifts.
   It is this debt in all its forms that compels those who peek
into the economy's future to turn their heads instead. It is what
forces economists seeking a way out to give up and hope instead
that we can muddle through. Debt is the economy's biggest burden as
it tries to ascend from recession.
   Home mortgages insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing
Administration and the Veterans Administration now total about $60
billion. Commercial bank credit is more than $2.6 trillion.
   While much of that debt is very sound, used to finance housing
and profitable commercial enterprises, an unknown percentage won't
be repaid, and that means everyone will pay - in higher borrowing
rates or perhaps in higher taxes or in even more government debt.
   There also is more than $700 billion of consumer installment
credit on the books, and a good deal of that also won't be repaid.
   Professor Robert Johnson, director of Purdue University's credit
research center, says the number of people filing for personal
bankruptcy in fiscal year 1989 was 3.5 times the number recorded a
decade ago.
   He estimates net bankruptcy losses on consumer installment
credit for 1989 were $1.4 billion, with $430 million of it for Visa
and MasterCard alone. These amounts, he points out, do not include
debts that would have been written off anyway as uncollectable; the
amounts reflect bankruptcy losses alone.
   Rather than believing Americans simply went mad over the past
decade or so, credit analysts try to explain the phenomenon in
terms of Americans succumbing to bait. Lenders and regulators
lowered lending standards.
   Perhaps American adults remember the old standards, those of the
1970s, when borrowers approached lenders as they would a federal
judge, knowing they would be grilled about the purpose for which
the money was sought.
   Under the newer standards, borrowers simply stayed home and
waited for the lenders to seek them out. Not only did the lenders
find them but they offered a credit card with thousands of dollars
in credit.
   Something of the sort occurred in commercial banking, with
lenders seeking to press money into the hands of real estate
developers. In 1984, real estate loans as a percentage of total
loans and leases was 25 percent. Recently, the percentage was more
than 37 percent. Much of the money won't be recovered, of course.
   Lax regulation by federal and state officials receives a great
deal of the blame, especially in commercial lending, but Johnson
believes there is a more fundamental issue involved in the consumer
debt.
   It is education, or the lack of it. ``Most consumers receive no
education in personal financial planning in high school,'' he says.
``We spend far more money teaching them to drive cars that they
don't know how to finance.''

<HEAD>Few Guarantees in Czechoslovakia's New Capitalism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a child, Josef Dundr would
stroll with his father past the snug Three Ostriches Inn, a
buff-colored 17th-century building that had belonged to the family
until the communists came.
   ``My father would say, `This used to be ours; maybe it will be
again some day','' said Dundr, who was born there 44 years ago. ``I
didn't see that day coming, I was so downtrodden by that time.''
   The communists no longer run Czechoslovakia and the day may come
after all.
   On Dec. 1, the government will start selling or giving back to
private owners 100,000 restaurants, small shops and other
businesses. The return of many factories and other large
enterprises will begin next year.
   In the new, no-frills capitalism of Czechoslovkia, however,
individuals may lose out to economic expedience. They risk losing
their jobs, as well as the chance of ownership, but the winners can
get rich.
   Officials cite the Soviet Union's many false starts in their
argument against moving slowly. All East European countries have
lost time since their communist regimes fell last year, but
Czechoslovakia now may be poised to outpace the others.
   For people with money, the switch to private enterprise ``is a
golden opportunity not to be repeated in this century,'' said
Miroslav Zamecnik, spokesman for Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus.
   There are few guarantees in the new system.
   Dundr may not get the Three Ostriches back. Alena Kubistova is
not sure she will have a job when a private owner takes over the
meat market she manages just off Wenceslas Square.
   Down the street, Ctirad Fuchs, 30, looks for a compromise
between his wish to own the music and book store he manages and the
interests of the building's new owner.
   President Vaclav Havel has warned that failure to protect such
people as Fuchs and the others could lead to unrest, but appears to
have yielded to Klaus's desire for quick reform.
   When Parliament approved the privatization law Oct. 25, the
finance minister acknowledged it would not ``satisfy all
completely.''
   Dundr, now assistant manager of the joint-venture Palace Hotel,
considers the Three Ostriches a sure moneymaker. It nestles at the
foot of the Charles Bridge on the royal route to Prague Castle, and
enjoyed a good reputation even under state ownership.
   He estimated its worth at 25 million to 70 million crowns, or
from $1 million to nearly $3 million.
   Emotion is deeply involved in the desire to get the inn back.
Dundr said his father, now 81, ``wants to feel that he can pass
this on to his children and grandchildren.''
   His likely rival for the Three Ostriches is the man who runs the
restaurant and the 18-room hotel the state made from the family
apartments above it. Dundr fears the manager's connections in the
bureaucracy give him an edge.
   ``In a case like this, millions are involved,'' he said.
``Stamps can be issued, documents can be signed.''
   If he gets the inn back, Dundr said, he will fire the manager
and staff of about 20 for inefficiency and rudeness.
   Zamecnik, the Finance Ministry spokesman, sees nothing wrong
with such action. ``The sooner they kick these people out, the
better,'' he said.
   Under the privatization law, property must be returned to former
owners or their heirs, or be auctioned. Local governments will set
bid prices, and any small business can be bought for a minimum of
half the asking price.
   Even before the law was approved, managers of state-run stores
held brief strikes to express concern that Czechoslovaks who got
rich on the black market or through past Communist Party
connections would have an advantage.
   According to Zamecnik, the government will not examine buyers
too closely because a quick change to private enterprise offers a
way to put ill-gotten wealth back into legal circulation.
   Dundr's position is that the Three Ostriches should be returned
to the family rather than auctioned. It falls into a gray area,
however.
   The family acquired the restaurant in about 1930 and was
nationalized after communists took power in 1948. The Dundrs kept
the building until 1962, then turned it over as a cultural monument
they could not afford to preserve.
   To protect consumers, the law requires that any shop going
private must continue selling the same goods for one year, but
privatization is much farther along than efforts to cushion its
effects.
   There are no requirements for private owners to retain current
employees or even to pay a minimum wage.
   Ms. Kubistova, like most working Czechoslovaks, has no
experience of market economics. She was 3 years old when the
communists took over.
   After her first talk with the new owner of the meat market, she
said, she is about 80 percent sure he will keep her on as manager,
at least for now.
   Her current salary of about $110 a month is above the national
average, but she said more important than pay is ``whether you will
have a job.''
   Fuchs would like to reach an agreement to own his music and book
store, and perhaps others of the approximately 100 in Prague.
   The store manager said he should have the chance not by right,
but because Prague needs such stores managed by competent people.
   ``Culture as a commodity will not be very attractive when the
price of paper and food go up,'' he said wryly.

<HEAD>Police Say Crime Increasing in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement officials say
violent crime is on the rise in some of Europe's traditionally
law-abiding nations. Critics accuse them of stirring up fear to get
bigger budgets.
   The average homicide rate in Europe remains only about one-fifth
that of the United States, which has approximately nine homicides
per 100,000 people each year, according to the U.N. World Health
Organization in Geneva.
   Homicide rates for the Netherlands and Switzerland rose 20
percent and 13 percent respectively in 1989, according to police
figures.
   Norway reported a 29 percent rise in violent crime from 1986
through 1988 and Italian homicides increased by 35 percent last
year, mostly in Mafia regions.
   Rape and theft skyrocketed last year in Eastern Europe,
accompaniments to economic instability and a deep-seated mistrust
of police under the former communist regimes.
   In Denmark, France and Portugal, however, the low homicide rates
have hardly changed in recent years. Significant declines have been
recorded in Britain, Germany and Belgium.
   ``Our whole society is getting more aggressive,'' said
Commissioner Herman Bergsma of the Central Police Intelligence
Service in Holland. ``What used to end up in fistfights now ends up
in gunfights.''
   The number of assaults with firearms in the Netherlands nearly
doubled from 134 in 1985 to 245 last year, mainly because of
killings by drug traffickers, Bergsma said.
   According to WHO statistics, the homicide rate in this nation of
14.9 million people had been one of the world's lowest, just above
Britain and Ireland.
   Herman Franke, a criminologist at the University of Amsterdam,
believes police are classifying more crime as violent to support
requests for larger budgets and more officers.
   ``Crime statistics are highly political,'' he said. ``They're
used to influence public opinion in every country.''
   In the Norwegian parliamentary elections, the conservative Party
of Progress went from 2 of the 165 seats to 22 on a wave of public
anxiety that followed reports of the 29 percent growth in violent
crime.
   ``Violent crime is not increasing,'' Franke said, ``only our
sensitivity to it.''
   Nils Christie, a University of Oslo criminology professor, said:
``Our biggest crime problem is the unfounded anxiety people feel.''
   Although the murder rate in neighboring Sweden has barely
changed in years, tighter gun laws are to take effect in 1991.
   Total crimes reported in Poland rose from 137,000 in 1988 to
more than 500,00 last year.
   ``The crime we witness today is a result of the political
situation,'' said Janusz Wydra, deputy police chief of Warsaw.
``The more freedom there is, the less security.''
   Poland has embarked on a conversion from communism to capitalism
that has cost about 1 million people their jobs and driven most
prices up more than 180 percent.
   Franke, the Dutch criminologist, argued that skyrocketing
statistics in former communist countries indicate the old regimes
doctored figures for political reasons, not that crime has
increased dramatically.
   He conceded that homes and businesses in the new East European
democracies are easy targets for thieves, since their owners have
little experience with crime prevention.
   ``In Warsaw, the situation is terrifying,'' said Wincenty
Grzeszczyk of the Polish General Prosecutor's Department. Stores do
a booming business in window grates, auto alarms, deadbolt locks
and Mace.
   Statistics in Czechoslovakia indicate crime has increased 400
percent in some Prague districts since President Vaclav Havel
declared a general amnesty in 1989 for most prisoners jailed under
the communists. The amnesty brought the release of about two-thirds
of the prison population.
   Muggings rose 250 percent in urban areas during the first six
months of 1990 and total crime was up 138 percent in the same
period, according to official figures.
   Italy is the most crime-prone country in Western Europe. Last
year's 1,295 homicides reflected a 35 percent increase from 1988.
   Britain tightened gun laws after a gun collector in Hungerford,
60 miles west of London, killed 16 people, including his mother, in
August 1987, then took his own life. The homicide rate has fallen
by half under the new laws.
   Most European countries severely restrict gun ownership, but
firearms are relatively easy to buy on the black market.
   Police in Copenhagen found hundreds of hand grenades, mines,
anti-tank rockets, handguns and rifles in the possession of a
pro-Palestinian group that had robbed banks for seven years.
   Still, Franke credited tough gun-control laws with making
European cities relatively murder-free - because, he said, ``people
can't resort to guns to solve their quarrels.''

<HEAD>Swimming Upstream: Can the Columbia River's Salmon Be Saved?</HEAD>

   His Colville Indian forefathers fished
this stretch of the Columbia River with dip nets and spears,
catching hundreds of salmon a day. Yet Hank Cate stood recently at
the Chief Joseph Dam, rod in hand, hoping to snag just one.
   ``My wife's starting to think I'm fishing down at the Bridgeport
tavern, it's been so long since I came home with a salmon,''Cate
said.
   The bountiful runs of salmon here died out decades ago, banging
their heads against the impassable walls of Chief Joseph and Grand
Coulee dams. A century ago, 12 million to 16 million salmon a year
swam up the Columbia to spawn. Today, only 2.8 million make the
trip.
   One of the Pacific Northwest's most prized natural resources has
been decimated by overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution, and,
most of all, a gantlet of hydroelectric dams obstructing the
salmon's passage and flooding their spawning streams.
   Now, despite one of the biggest wildlife restoration projects in
U.S. history, conservationists say some runs of Columbia River
salmon face extinction. They're pushing for action under the
federal Endangered Species Act.
   Once again, the battle lines are drawn in the Pacific Northwest
between economics and the environment.
   ``The Columbia River is an example of technology gone mad,''
said Bill Bakke, executive director of Oregon Trout, a conservation
group. ``We've squeezed benefits out of the river with technology,
and now we're trying to fix the problems with technology. It's not
working.''
   Oregon Trout and other conservation groups heated up the salmon
debate earlier this year by proposing that four wild runs, or
subpopulations, of Columbia basin salmon be listed under the
Endangered Species Act.
   Federal wildlife officials won't decide on the listing until
next spring. But the proposal already has ignited tempers among
competing river users, who include dam operators, farmers on
irrigated land, and commercial, tribal and sport fishermen.
   To some in the Northwest, the salmon issue looks all too
familiar. The region already faces enormous social costs in
protecting the northern spotted owl, a forest-dwelling bird whose
recent ``threatened'' listing by federal officials has devastated
some timber-dependent towns.
   ``The salmon issue has a greater potential to impact far more
people right in their pocketbooks than the spotted owl,'' said Rich
Brown, an aide to Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   Wyden's office has estimated that if hydropower production is
cut to save salmon, Northwest electricity rates could rise by up to
33 percent.
   The technological attempts to save the salmon began in 1980.
Federal agencies and dam operators have spent more than $1 billion
to pump up populations with hatcheries, barge tiny salmon
downstream around dams, even shoot off fireworks to scare predatory
sea gulls away from dams.
   But after 10 years, conservationists claim the costly effort has
accomplished little. What's worse, they say, a flood of
hatchery-bred fish actually is pushing wild salmon closer to
extinction.
   There are six species of Pacific salmon in the Texas-sized
Columbia basin, and hundreds of distinct runs, or stream
populations. A listing would apply only to a few of the most
endangered runs. But protective action might be necessary from
hatching areas 700 miles inland all the way to the Pacific Ocean,
where salmon mature before returning upstream to spawn.
   Environmentalists say protecting a few runs would benefit other
Columbia basin salmon. And Bakke says applying the Endangered
Species Act would force a philosophical change among river
managers: instead of taming the salmon, make the river more wild.
   On the Columbia River, that's an unconventional idea.
   The 1,200-mile Columbia is the second-largest U.S. river by
volume, and one of the world's most domesticated rivers. Over 60
years, its once-raging waters have been turned into a chain of
stillwater lakes. Its flow is regulated on the main stem and its
tributaries by 56 hydroelectric dams, which produce cheap
electricity and irrigated farmland vital to the Northwest economy.
   The Grand Coulee Dam in eastern Washington, the nation's largest
hydro dam, blocked 1,100 miles of spawning habitat upstream when it
was completed in 1941. The dam has no fish ladder, a stair-stepping
channel that allows fish upstream. Fourteen years later, Chief
Joseph Dam was built 50 miles downstream, again with no ladder.
Chief Joseph is 545 miles upstream from the Pacific.
   Most other Columbia basin dams do have fish ladders, but even
those dams kill fish.
   Spring torrents that once swept young salmon downstream now
stall out in reservoirs. The salmon, known as smolts, must race to
the ocean against their own biological clock, which in 30 days
turns them into saltwater fish. Some don't make it and die in the
river.
   An additional 10 percent to 15 percent of smolts die each time
they pass through or over a high dam. Some are chewed up in the
turbines; some emerge so dazed they are easy prey for gulls and
squawfish.
   Other man-made hazards await at every turn. Sediments from
logging roads can turn the porous gravel of stream-bottom egg beds
into suffocating concrete. Salmon swim into unscreened irrigation
ditches, only to die amid the alfalfa.
   ``It makes you wonder how they do it,'' said Greg Hovland, a
fish and wildlife specialist who tags salmon and traces their
migration for the Grant County Public Utility District.
   The ambitious salmon recovery plan is coordinated by the
Northwest Power Planning Council, created by Congress in 1980.
Under the council's direction, dam operators spend about $100
million a year for salmon - about $36 for each returning fish in
the annual run.
   The plan's most successful program also is the most hotly
debated: starting fish in hatcheries, then releasing them into
streams as young salmon. Hatchery fish now comprise more than 70
percent of the Columbia's adult salmon, helping to increase the
total annual run by 12 percent since 1980.
   But those gains may be short-lived, Oregon Trout's Bakke said.
Hatchery fish can dilute genetic stocks of wild fish, compete for
food and spawning areas, and reduce the entire population's ability
to survive, he said.
   Hatchery supporters acknowledge there are problems, but say
hatcheries are needed to jump-start depressed salmon populations.
New hatcheries that better match fish to their local environment
will help, they say.
   Bakke suggests less artificial remedies: release more water over
dams to help smolts swim downstream, limit commercial fishing, and
stop destroying spawning habitat.
   He says applying the Endangered Species Act would give federal
wildlife agencies more authority to enforce such measures. Now,
they often must negotiate compromises with other powerful river
interests.
   Some of those interests - aware that reserving more water for
fish would mean higher electricity rates and irrigation costs - say
the salmon already have enough clout.
   ``We'd rather avoid a listing, mainly because a listing throws a
lot of extra bureaucracy into it,'' said Al Wright, executive
director of the Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee, a
hydropower group.
   In October, the power planning council started a series of
``salmon summits.'' It invited all interested parties to help
create a new river management plan.
   But even the best intentions cannot dissolve a hard reality: The
mighty Columbia no longer has the water, the power, or the salmon
for all the hungry mouths that want to take a bite.
   ``We'll be lucky, indeed, if over the next 30 or 40 years we can
double the number of fish,'' said Tom Trulove, a member of the
power planning council. ``That's about the limit of the available
habitat. We'll never have 16 million fish again.''

   Once again, it's economics versus the environment in the Pacific
Northwest. Extensive damming on the Colorado River helped fuel the
region's growth. But the dams also decimated the population of the
Columbia River salmon. Environmentalists are pushing for federal
protection, and the looming battle could have even greater economic
consequences than the recent moves to protect the forest-dwelling
spotted owl.

   Shirley Ceasar is 27 years old, and she's
expecting her 10th child. But another baby won't be a burden for
her. Like the rest of her kids, the child will be taken care of by
its grandmother.
   Shirley, a crack addict for at least four years, lives in Harlem
with her boyfriend, the father of all her children. Her mother,
Sarah Mae Ceasar, lives a 15-minute subway ride away, in a housing
project in lower Manhattan.
   There, in a cramped three-bedroom apartment, Mrs. Ceasar takes
care of five of her grandchildren, including 11-year-old Walique,
who was born deaf and mentally retarded. Shirley's other children
are cared for by their paternal grandmother.
   ``I used to go up and see them and there was nothing in the
refrigerator to eat, no clothes for them to wear, they weren't even
going to school,'' said Mrs. Ceasar, 57, who is hoping to adopt the
children. ``I'd bring them clothes. Their father would sell the
clothes for drugs.''
   In New York City and other large metropolitan areas,
grandmothers like Mrs. Ceasar are the glue holding together many
poor black families splintered by drugs.
   In the past five years, the crack epidemic has made addicts of
more young minority women than any other drug in history. In
particular, experts say, it has threatened the tradition of black
women who often hold their families together.
   ``There's a quality in crack that is so quickly addictive that
people don't get away with experimenting with it,'' said Richard
Johnson, director of the Jewish Child Care Association of New York.
``Women who would normally retain some responsibility and some
conscience about their children don't have the chance. They're
addicted so quickly. They're just lost.''
   Since 1985, the number of children in New York City's kinship
foster care program, which allows grandmothers and other relatives
to receive aid for taking care of dependents, has jumped from 150
to 17,000.
   Seventy percent of the placements of children within kinship
foster care are the result of mothers' crack addiction, Johnson
said.
   ``Certainly the absence of a father is bad, but now the mother
is missing,'' said Melba Hamilton, director of the Harlem Dowling
Children's Service. ``These children are facing a very bleak
future.''
   And as a result, grandmothers such as Mrs. Ceasar have been
called upon to assume enormous family burdens.
   They are mostly Southern women, tied to a rural past while mired
in the harsh economic realities of the inner city, according to
social workers. Many came to New York as newlyweds, hoping for a
better life. Most have outlived their husbands and lost some of
their children to drugs and the streets.
   Now they must become mothers again, sometimes caring for
children born toxic and mentally handicapped because of their
mothers' addictions.
   ``A lot of the grandmothers are really exhausted and would like
to not have to do this,'' said Johnson. ``But if it has to be done,
they're going to do it.''
   Some grandmothers care for their grandchildren on an informal
basis. But a growing number are taking advantage of kinship foster
care and the financial aid it offers. Depending on the age of the
child, foster grandmothers are allowed anywhere from $450 to $900
per month for their care.
   Despite the strain the grandchildren add to their lives, some
grandmothers are surprisingly resilient and learn to enjoy having
kids around again.
   Some are younger than the stereotypical grandmother. In the
words of Lorraine Hale, director of Hale House, a Harlem home for
the children of unwed, working and drug-addicted mothers, ``They
don't all wear their gray hair in a bun and act wise.'' But they're
often realistic when it comes to the problems of their own
children.
   ``It's not my fault,'' said Mrs. Ceasar of the drug addiction of
her daughter, Shirley, and her other children. ``It's their fault
and it's their life. If they don't want to make anything out of
their life, there's nothing I can do about it.''
   Her grandchildren remain loyal to their parents but said they
love their grandmother and the security of her home.
   ``She takes us out places and does a lot of things with us,''
said Rasheeda, 10. ``I like being home with her instead of a foster
home.''
   The children's father, Lorenzo Adderley, 28, also said he was
grateful to Sarah Ceasar. As he stood in the doorway of the Harlem
apartment he shares with Shirley Ceasar, whom he met when he was
14, Adderley said he was looking for work and that Shirley soon may
go into a drug rehabilitation center.
   Mrs. Ceasar said both Adderley and her daughter are addicts.
Adderley said Shirley was, but denied that he was an addict, though
he appeared to be under the influence of drugs during an interview.
Shirley Ceasar declined to be interviewed.
   Mrs. Ceasar, who was born and raised in Sumter, S.C., is not
unlike many of the grandmothers who look a decade or more older
than their age, testament to unusually harsh lives.
   Mrs. Ceasar's life story, the details of which she recounted
stoically in her living room as her grandchildren did their
homework at the dining room table, has been one of frequent
tragedy.
   Her father was an alcoholic who beat his wife and children and
forced her to begin work in the field picking peas and corn at the
age of 8. Two of her brothers were murdered as young adults. She
got pregnant at 13 and married the father.
   After the family moved to New York, one of Mrs. Ceasar's sons
was strangled at age 17 and another died of a heart attack in her
living room at age 30.
   Seated in a Manhattan social services office with her
caseworker, Blanche Giles, 68, who arrived in Harlem from Atlanta
in 1949, recounts an equally tumultuous life.
   She copes by rising at 5 a.m. every day and opening to the 91st
Psalm in the Bible she brought from Georgia.
   ``It opens up the day for me,'' she said. ``It keeps me going.''
   Mrs. Giles needs all the spiritual sustenance she can muster.
She has been a widow since 1967. Her only child, a daughter, died
of a heart attack brought on by alcoholism and other addictions at
the age of 45 the same year.
   Mrs. Giles then raised her two granddaughters, one of whom,
Marilyn, also an alcoholic, died of a brain tumor in 1987. Mrs.
Giles, who often had cared for Marilyn's children over the years,
now has custody of Rochelle, 17, Randy, 15, Andree, 13, Eunique,
11, and Tenell, 10. Rochelle is pregnant with twins.
   Mrs. Giles' other granddaughter also has had problems with
addiction, and her two children are with their paternal
grandmother.

   Viola Jenkins, 63, has lived in the same apartment building in
the South Bronx ever since she arrived in New York from her native
Fayetteville, N.C., in 1945. Her husband, with whom she had four
children, died in 1982.
   Since 1985, she's taken care of her grandson and granddaughter.
They were placed in her care after authorities were tipped off that
the children were being tied to the radiator in the apartment they
shared with their parents, who fought often and were involved with
drugs.
   Every morning, after the kids leave the apartment for school,
Mrs. Jenkins walks over to her bedroom window. She keeps a pillow
there to rest her elbows while she gazes out onto Union Avenue and
watches her two grandchildren until they disappear from sight.
   ``I can see them almost all the way to school,'' she said on a
recent morning as she craned her neck out the window. ``If I try to
walk them to school, they think I'm treating them like babies.''
   She tries not to worry too much about the drug dealers who
infest Union Avenue. She points them out as she gazes out the
window at the desolate landscape of vacant lots and gutted
buildings.
   ``New York City is such a fast city,'' she said. ``But coming
from the South makes me strong. It gave me roots and a
background.''

   At the age of 60, Mary Johnson watches over not
one or two but four generations of her family.
   ``It's scary,'' she said of her 1985 decision to take in two
grandchildren. ``Because you're tired. It's time to relax, but all
of a sudden it's not that way. You have to be a mother again.
   ``But if they're my blood, I want to know where they are,'' she
said during an interview at a Harlem foster-care agency.
   Mrs. Johnson, a mother of nine, credits her upbringing in
Montgomery, Ala., with giving her the strength to survive a
lifetime of hardship.
   Dressed in a red striped dress and black slippers, her hair tied
in a bun, Mrs. Johnson chainsmoked and leaned her heavy-set frame
back in a chair as she told her story.
   In 1985, Mrs. Johnson's daughter, who had a history of drug
abuse, died of AIDS. She took custody of her grandson and
granddaughter after the father decided he was too ``devastated'' to
care for them.
   But a year after Mrs. Johnson's daughter died, her grandson
succumbed to the same AIDS virus.
   ``I went through hell, but I didn't show it,'' she said. ``It's
very hard to see a little 5-year-old struggle for his life. When he
died, I was lying right beside him in his bed at Harlem Hospital.''
   Within the next two years, her son also died of AIDS and her
husband died. Mrs. Johnson's 38-year-old daughter moved in with her
after suffering two nervous breakdowns.
   Mrs. Johnson also watches out for her own mother who lives
nearby. Her mother, who is 80 years old, is herself taking care of
two great-grandchildren, ages 18 and 22.
   Mrs. Johnson, meanwhile, keeps a watchful eye on her
granddaughter, now 17.
   ``She wants to get married, but she's not going to,'' said Mrs.
Johnson. ``It was OK for me to marry young. She's not half the
woman I am. You gotta have some get up and go. That's what I have.
I'm strong.''

   The Federal Reserve, responding to increasing
signs of a recession, soon will cut interest rates in a move that
should prompt banks to lower a variety of consumer and business
rates, private economists predict.
   The Fed's credit easing is likely to spur a one-half percentage
point cut in the prime lending rate, and home mortgage rates should
decline modestly as well, analysts said Monday.
   Any reduction in the prime rate, which has been stuck at 10
percent since January, would be seen as a boost to economic
activity because about one-third of all consumer and business loans
are tied to changes in the prime.

<TEXT>
   By making a bid to merge with Pan Am Corp.,
Trans World Airlines Inc. Chairman Carl C. Icahn has shown he wants
to cut a deal that could reshape his airline, analysts say.
   ``I think TWA has to do something,'' said Edmund Greenslet, at
ESG Aviation Services, in Jacksonville, Fla. ``They either have to
acquire more airline assets or sell their assets to somebody else.
''
   Kevin Murphy at Morgan Stanley said Icahn might not have had his
eyes set on a merger with Pan Am when he made the offer.
   ``What you see isn't what you get with this guy,'' Murphy said
Monday. ``There are other ways he can benefit.''
   Pan Am declined to commment Monday on the merit or the status of
Icahn's offer, made Friday in a letter to Pan Am Chairman Thomas G.
Plaskett. Pan Am said its ``focus'' was on a previously announced
deal to sell prized London routes to rival UAL Corp. in a deal that
also includes a marketing combination with United Airlines.
   Pan Am said it understood Icahn's offer, for about $150 million
in cash and securities with a face value of about $300 million,
would come into play only if the UAL deal is not completed by
Wednesday's deadline.
   Several airline analysts said they believed Pan Am will proceed
with the UAL deal, even though a merger with TWA would be
beneficial to both Pan Am and TWA. They are considered among the
weaker of the large U.S. airlines, which all have been hit hard by
rising fuel costs, but a merger would give the resulting carrier
strength in Europe and Latin America.
   Even if Icahn's offer for Pan Am falls through, the TWA chairman
loses nothing by making it, experts said.
   ``If he can prevent United Airlines from going into London, that
would prevent a more formidable carrier from going into Heathrow,''
Murphy said. ``By creating more market forces for international
assets and routes, that can only come back and help him, should he
also decide to sell assets.''
   Without a merger with Pan Am, TWA will be left in a position
where it either needs to buy assets, such as the Atlanta hub and
Miami overhaul base of Eastern Airlines that it has expressed an
interest in, or sell its own assets, analysts said.
   The head of the TWA branch of the Air Line Pilots Association,
Kent Scott, agreed Icahn may have been sending a broader signal
through the merger offer.
   ``I think this is Icahn's way of stirring up interest in TWA and
saying `Hey, I want to do a deal, whether it's buy, sell or
whatever,''' Scott said.
   The TWA offer raised new questions about Pan Am's immediate
future.
   ``As far as I can see, it's sort of hazy at the moment,'' said
Thomas Canning, at Standard &amp; Poor's. ``We've got to wait for the
reaction from Pan Am. For their fiduciary duties, they have to
consider it.''
   Pan Am did not preclude merger talks.
   ``We are not going to comment on whether or not we have had any
communications with Mr. Icahn since we have received his letter,''
Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.
   UAL refused to say whether it believes the TWA offer jeopardizes
its pact with Pan Am. ``Talk to Pan Am,'' spokesman Joe Hopkins
said.
   Since the cash value of the securities offered by TWA would
vary, analysts were uncertain whether Pan Am stockholders would
gain money or lose money through the transaction.
   Pan Am stock rose 25 cents to $1.87{ in active trading Monday.
   Pan Am and TWA are the only U.S. carriers to fly into London's
Heathrow Airport, the most desirable destination in the city that
is considered the gateway to Europe. Analysts predicted a TWA-Pan
AM merger would face regulatory troubles because the government
would not want to see all of those routes fall into the same
corporate hands.
   AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, has said it would
pay in excess of $500 million for the London routes, but Pan Am
said it was not interested in merely selling the routes. Pan Am
said its marketing arrangement with UAL would help build up its
Latin American service with flights connecting through Miami.

<HEAD>Competitors Plan To Break Intel's Lucrative Computer Chip Monopoly</HEAD>

   Several competitors are trying to break Intel
Corp.'s lucrative monopoly over a microprocessor that increasingly
is the chip of choice for IBM personal computers and compatible
models.
   Intel's 80386 microprocessor has been a runaway success,
bringing in about a billion dollars a year in revenue and some of
the highest profit margins the semiconductor industry has ever
seen, said Michael Slater, editor of the newsletter Microprocessor
Report.
   Microprocessors are fingernail-sized wafers of silicon
containing circuitry that acts as the brains of personal computers.
   One of the would-be interlopers, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.,
began giving private demonstrations Monday of its 386 clone at the
huge Comdex computer show here. AMD removed Intel's chips from
several personal computers and replaced them with its own version.
   ``There are no compatibility problems with it - it works,'' said
AMD spokesman David Frink. He said about 20 computer makers are
testing the chip or have already evaluated it.
   A public announcement of the AMD microprocessor awaits a
determination of its price and availability date, officials of the
semiconductor company said.
   AMD says it used a process called reverse engineering to devise
a chip that mimics the 386 but uses different circuitry. In fact,
AMD says its chip is better because it uses less power.
   Several other semiconductor companies also are working on 386
clones, industry analysts say.
   But Intel, one of the world's largest semiconductor companies,
is not sitting still while competitors try to chip away at its
blockbuster product. It is involved in a thicket of legal conflicts
with AMD, with which it once enjoyed a cooperative relationship.
   Intel has filed two lawsuits, one contending AMD has no right to
a crucial component of the 386 chip called microcode, and the
second charging that AMD would infringe on Intel's trademark if it
uses the 386 name to market its chip.
   On Friday, a federal judge denied Intel's request for an
injunction to block AMD from using the 386 name. But it was unclear
whether the ruling would give computer makers who use the AMD chip
the right to call them 386 machines.
   The microcode suit stems from a 1976 agreement in which Intel
granted AMD the right to the patents and microcode for Intel
microprocessors. Intel now claims AMD may only copy the microcode
for its own use, not to sell chips containing it.
   Microcode is a set of software instructions contained in a
memory device on each microprocessor. It tells the circuits how to
process data.
   AMD, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., will devise microcode of its
own to mimic Intel's if it loses the suit, Frink said.
   AMD also is involved in another legal battle with Intel that
could result in AMD gaining rights to make a carbon copy of the 386
chip. That dispute, now in abritration, stems from a 1982
technology-sharing agreement between the two companies.
   Intel claims AMD reneged on the agreement. AMD says it met the
terms of the pact and should be given access to the 386 chip, as
well as $500 million in damages.
   An arbitrator ruled last month that Intel did not act in good
faith in the dispute, but he delayeddeciding whether AMD should
gain rights to the 386 chip until another phase of the proceeding,
which is scheduled to start this week.
   ``The lawyers are really doing well over Intel and AMD,'' said
Slater, the newsletter editor.
   Intel's 386 chip, introduced in 1985, is becoming the favored
microprocessor for International Business Machines Corp. personal
computers and clones. It is faster than the 286 chip it succeeded
but not as costly as Intel's top-of-the-line 486.
   Four companies, including AMD, make clones of the 286 chip under
license from Intel, said Intel spokeswoman Pam Pollace from the
company's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters.
   But no such licenses are planned for the 386 chip despite the
fact that Intel has been rationing its production to customers,
Pollace said. She said Intel expects to meet demand by year's end.
   Dataquest, a high-tech research firm, says 7.3 million personal
computers with the 386 chip and its lower-cost variant, the 386SX,
will be shipped this year.
   Dataquest projects that shipments of 386-based machines will
grow at a double-digit pace over the next four years, while those
of computers with the 286 will decline about 7 percent.

<HEAD>Key Asbestos Settlement Plan Up in Air, Threatening Manville Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attempts to overhaul the troubled Manville trust
to compensate asbestos disease victims have hit roadblocks because
of a dispute in a separate case.
   Negotiations to settle 65,000 asbestos claims against
Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. were designed as a first step toward
clearing a nationwide court backlog.
   But lawyers for asbestos disease victims are upset over a
perceived pro-industry bent on the part of U.S. District Judge Jack
B. Weinstein, who is seeking to resolve the asbestos litigation
crisis.
   In an apparent effort to speed negotiations and placate
plaintiffs lawyers, Weinstein on Monday approved a request by
Eagle-Picher to pay asbestos victims who already have settled with
the company.
   Weinstein earlier had halted all payments by the
Cincinnati-based maker of industrial products and auto parts for
one month during settlement negotiations that would create an
independent compensation fund and free the company of future
liability payments.
   ``What they're looking for is to cut off their exposure in
return for a total payment, ... which the plaintiffs find
acceptable,'' said Peter Angelos, a Baltimore plaintiffs lawyer
appointed by Weinstein to negotiate with Eagle-Picher.
   But other plaintiffs lawyers want victims to receive a majority
stake in Eagle-Picher stock. They also are angry at Weinstein for
making orders that would reduce legal fees and delay payments by
the company to victims.
   In apparent response, the lawyers threatened to break off talks
on restructuring the Manville trust, which has 130,000 pending
claims, the most in the nation.
   Manville Corp. turned over a majority equity stake to an
independent trust set up to resolve present and future asbestos
claims. Manville emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
1988.
   But that trust ran out of money to meet its payments earlier
this year. Manville recently agreed to inject up to $520 million
over seven years into the fund.
   Negotiations with plaintiffs lawyers in the Manville case are
seeking a scheme for paying victims with more serious diseases
before those with lesser ailments. People involved in those talks
said they were ``within hours'' of a settlement recently before
plaintiffs lawyers backed out.
   In the Eagle-Picher case, once an agreement is reached Weinstein
is expected to approve a class-action lawsuit to apportion money to
victims.
   On Monday, eight plaintiffs lawyers asked Weinstein to be added
to the settlement talks, further increasing tensions in the case.
They said the court-appointed plaintiffs lawyers negotiating with
Eagle-Picher were not representative of all victims.
   ``Any of the proposed settlements only prevents the victims from
getting their full value and all the other creditors and the
stockholders to continue business as usual,'' said Gene Locks, a
Philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer.
   Eagle-Picher earlier this month said it was close to a
settlement. Individuals involved said the company would have set
aside about $500 million over 20 years, but plaintiffs lawyers
disputed that amount and said no agreement was reached.
   Angelos said the proposal ``fell short of what they were capable
of doing in the present and future in light of the resources
available to them.''
   Eagle-Picher has said it needs to settle all its claims or face
insolvency by the end of 1992. Its liability stems from its
production from 1934 to 1971 of an asbestos-containing cement used
primarily in Navy yard boiler rooms. The company has said its
liability from the product will exceed $1 billion.
   The Eagle-Picher case is being closely watched as a possible
model for dozens of other companies facing huge and growing
liabilities because of asbestos products that caused lung cancer
and other ailments. Several companies have entered bankruptcy
proceedings because of their liabilities.
   More than 90,000 asbestos lawsuits are pending in state and
federal courts nationwide. Many victims were exposed decades ago to
the insulation and heat resistance mineral but still await
compensation.

<HEAD>Interior Secretary: Oil Companies Need Better Public Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans wrongly believe offshore oil drilling
is more threatening to the environment than shipping oil in
tankers, says Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
   ``The real problem is tankers. And when we prevent the
production of domestic oil supplies, then we're inviting more
imports,'' Lujan said at a news conference Monday at the American
Petroleum Institute's annual meeting.
   Lujan said the main reason he came to the meeting was to try to
persuade leaders of big oil companies to explain their case better.
   ``If there's going to be any production, there must be better
public relations to try to explain why something can be done in an
environmentally sensitive manner,'' he said.
   ``If the public is not convinced that we can do it in an
environmentally sound manner, then we will continue with moratoria
by Congress and we will continue with opposition by the general
public,'' he said.
   Lujan was referring to a one-year moratorium that Congress
renewed before it adjourned last month. The moratorium maintained
the wide-reaching prohibition on oil and gas leasing along
thousands of miles of coastal waters from Alaska to New England.
   One oil-industry representative said at the time that the Outer
Continental Shelf contains enough oil to replace the United States'
imports from the Persian Gulf for the next 25 years.
   But environmentalists have said the ban is necessary to protect
coastal areas, where Congress has blocked drilling for nearly a
decade through annual bans on lease sales through the Interior
Department's budget.
   President Bush last summer postponed, up to 10 years in some
cases, oil-and gas-lease sales off the West Coast, New England and
southern Florida until environmental concerns can be resolved. But
Lujan said he and Bush agree it is advantageous to develop domestic
supplies.
   Also at the meeting Monday, an oil industry analyst said the
United States should consider investing in the Soviet Union to
reduce reliance on Persian Gulf oil and to help speed economic
reform in that country.
   ``The area is very, very ripe for Western involvement,'' said
Lou Pugliaresi, president of Washington-based LPI Consulting.
   ``The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the emerging crisis in the
world oil market have underscored the energy security benefits to
the United States and the West of oil production outside the
Persian Gulf,'' Pugliaresi said in a panel discussion about
prospects for the industry.

   American savings and loans might seem like
the last place the Soviet Union would look for advice on how to
finance its fledgling private housing market.
   But Valery P. Sorokin, a Soviet Foreign Ministry economist and
diplomat, is enthusiastically pumping executives at the 98th annual
convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions for
everything he can learn.
   ``We want to avoid the extremes ... the bad side of this whole
business. ... But we want to take the best that you have to
offer,'' Sorokin said in an interview Monday.
   The Soviet Union has embarked on a 500-day program to transform
its communist economy into something approaching the free-market
system found in Western countries.
   Part of the program, he said, is an overhaul of the U.S.S.R.
Savings Bank, in effect a giant government-owned savings and loan
that is half again as big as Citicorp, the largest U.S. financial
institution.
   According to Sorokin, who was addressing convention delegates
today, the bank will remain government-owned, but it will lose its
monopoly on the finances of Soviet citizens.
   It will compete against savings institutions established by
Soviet republics and eventually against privately owned S&amp;Ls, he
said.
   In addition to lending to people who want to build or buy a
home, the Soviet savings bank will finance private businesses
producing construction material and others building homes and
apartments for later rent or sale, Sorokin said.
   But first, the Soviets will have to learn banking basics that
Americans take for granted.
   ``We desperately need to computerize our savings and loan
operation,'' Sorokin said after touring the convention's exhibit
hall where computer and software firms touted their products.
``Right now it's being done, not in Moscow certainly, but in some
provinces with abacuses.''
   ``We also are very interested in such trivial aspects of savings
and loans, such as verifying the credit standing of the customer.
... We just don't have this culture. Since people never had much
private property, they don't have a credit record,'' he said.
   James H. Grohl, senior vice president of the league, said the
trade group first offered its assistance to the Soviets about three
months ago. Sorokin, who until recently was stationed at the Soviet
embassy in Washington, met with S&amp;L executives before returning to
Moscow to consult with officials of the Soviet savings bank.
   Sorokin said he hopes to establish an exchange program where top
Soviet bank officials would visit the United States to confer with
their counterparts. He also would like to arrange internships for
Soviet trainees at successful U.S. thrift associations.
   Grohl said league officials are considering the proposals and
hope to get the program started sometime next year.
   Sorokin, who is quick with a joke, is aware of the irony of
seeking advice from an industry many Americans consider a failure.
   ``Our professional people will be looking to your system of
guarantees, to your system of auditing and examining and probably
even thinking of creating a Resolution Trust (the rescue agency for
failed S&amp;Ls) just in case,'' he said with a laugh.
   ``We understand there is not a perfect example of everything. If
you go to the stock exchange, there are good and bad aspects of it,
but it's a viable institution and it performs a very useful
function in a market society. ... The same is true of savings and
loans,'' he said.
   One obstacle that Soviet thrifts will have to overcome is
attracting deposits with government-controlled interest rates less
than the inflation rate.
   Soviet S&amp;Ls, at least for a time, will avoid one of the most
basic problems faced by U.S. thrifts: the up-and-down cycle of the
housing market.
   Currently, U.S. institutions are suffering from declining home
sales. But in the Soviet Union, demand for housing, long
unsatisfied by the communist economy, is strong.
   ``If the environment is stable, the demand for housing is
virtually unlimited,'' Sorokin said. ``That's where the savings and
loan system of the Soviet Union will be cashing in.''

<HEAD>Simmons Makes $2 Billion Bid for Lockheed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons wants Lockheed
Corp.'s help in completing a $2 billion offer for the stock he
doesn't already own in the aerospace company.
   Lockheed, which has rebuffed Simmons' previous attempts to
increase his 20 percent stake, said it needed more details on the
$40 a share offer.
   Simmons made the offer Monday through Houston-based NL
Industries Inc., which he controls. But a letter containing the
offer made plain Simmons will need help from Lockheed, maker of spy
planes and the stealth fighter.
   ``In order to effect a transaction of this magnitude in today's
capital markets, it is essential that we have Lockheed's
cooperation and support,'' said the letter from NL president J.
Landis Martin to Lockheed chairman Daniel M. Tellep.
   Takeover transactions have become more difficult since the
collapse of the junk bond market. The high-yield high-risk debt
securities helped fuel the takeover frenzy of the '80s. In
addition, major banks have been reluctant to lend money for
buyouts.
   Martin said NL and its affiliates own $500 million worth of
Lockheed stock and have cash and other assets ``we are willing to
dedicate to this effort.''
   Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed has treated Simmons coolly at
best since he first began acquiring the company's stock last year.
But on Monday, the company said it would ``give full consideration
to NL's indication of interest when further details are provided.''
   Simmons was traveling and could not be reached for comment
Monday. But Martin said the $40 per share offer is ``a number we
think would be overwhelmingly supported by shareholders.''
   He said the offer was made to boost the value of Lockheed's
stock, which has been trading at about $25 after trading at twice
that in the past year. Simmons paid about $43 each for his 12.5
million shares in Lockheed.
   News of Simmons' offer came after the markets closed Monday.
Lockheed closed up 75 cents at $30.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange. NL closed down 12{ cents at $11.25 on the NYSE.
   Since he first started buying stock in Lockheed last year, the
company has viewed Simmons as an opportunistic raider. Simmons has
maintained that he is just trying to make the company more
profitable.
   In mounting a proxy war that culminated at Lockheed's annual
meeting last spring, Simmons enlisted help from several large
institutional investors who agreed with him that Lockheed's board
had been unresponsive to shareholders.
   At the meeting, Lockheed made several changes in its corporate
rules that were regarded as concessions to shareholders. But the
company left intact its chief defense, a ``poison pill'' that made
it prohibitively expensive for an unwanted suitor to buy more than
20 percent of Lockheed's common stock.
   In September, Lockheed's directors agreed to suspend the poison
pill if a takeover offer meets certain conditions. They include
that it must be for 100 percent of the company, be in cash, and be
approved by a majority of shareholders not counting the one making
the offer.
   Before that change, Simmons had tried to increase his stake by
offering $35 a share for 10 million shares in Lockheed's employee
stock ownership plan. Lockheed directors established the plan to
secure that voting stock with workers, Simmons has said.

<TEXT>
   Business and consumer interest rates should
begin falling soon if private economists are right in forecasting
that the Federal Reserve is ready to ease credit conditions.
   Members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's
top policymaking group, gathered for a closed-door meeting today to
review recent economic developments and chart a course for interest
rates in coming months.
   In light of a widely held view that the country has slipped into
a recession, many economists predicted that Fed policymakers will
vote to push interest rates lower in an effort to lessen the
severity of any downturn.
   This expectation was bolstered by some good news on the
inflation front. The runup in oil prices that followed Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait has so far not become embedded outside the
energy area. Weak demand has kept producers of other goods from
boosting prices.
   The combination of a weak economy and moderation on inflation,
including a big drop Monday in oil prices, should tilt the central
bank toward easing credit to lessen the severity of the slump,
analysts said.
   ``We can't really argue very much any more about whether the
country is in a recession, but we can still argue about how bad it
is going to be,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist at
DRI-McGraw Hill. ``I think the Fed will work to keep the recession
from being a severe one.''
   The Fed trimmed the federal funds rate, the interest banks
charge each other for overnight loans, from 8 percent to 7.75
percent less than two weeks ago as a vote of confidence in the
congressionally approved deficit package.
   Many economists were looking for a further reduction in this
rate to 7.5 percent. This should be enough to prompt banks to cut
their prime lending rate by one-half percentage point to 9.5
percent, they said.
   The prime rate - what banks charge their best customers - has
been stuck at 10 percent since last January. Any reduction would be
seen as a boost to the economy since about one-third of all
consumer and business loan rates are tied to the prime.
   But even if the Fed reduces its funds rate this week, banks may
choose to delay lowering the prime until early December in order to
bolster their sagging profit margins, analysts said.
   Some analysts said the Fed could decide this week to reduce its
discount rate, the interest the central bank charges to commercial
banks.
   The discount rate, now at 7 percent, has not been lowered in
more than four years. Such a move would be the most dramatic signal
the Fed could send of its intention to fight an economic slump.
   However, Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said he
expected the Fed to opt for the more modest 0.25 percentage point
reduction in the funds rate because of lingering fears that
inflation from the Middle East turmoil still could get out of hand.
   ``The developing recession looks bad enough to prompt the Fed to
make an additional easing move,'' Sinai said. ``But even with
another modest easing move, the Fed is taking an inflation risk,
hoping that the oil and energy inflation rate does not creep deeply
into the underlying inflation rate.''
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
believed the central bank under the chairmanship of Alan Greenspan
was in danger of repeating the mistakes made by the Fed following
the first oil shock of 1973-74.
   Evans said the Fed, under the direction of then-Fed Chairman
Arthur Burns, eased too quickly and ended up allowing inflation
from the oil shock to become embedded in the economy.
   ``I am concerned that the Greenspan Fed could be setting the
stage for a severe bout of inflation later on in the decade,''
Evans said.
   Other analysts said they believed the inflation risk is worth
taking in an effort to jump-start the economy.
   With oil prices taking a sharp drop Monday, many economists said
that should spell further relief for home buyers in terms of lower
mortgage rates, which tend to follow the price of long-term bonds.
   Wyss predicted that fixed-rate mortgages, which stand just above
10 percent nationally, could dip to 9.5 percent in coming weeks.

   Foreign publishers must obtain the Singapore
government's permission to sell their newspapers and magazines here
effective Dec. 1, the Communication and Information Ministry said
Tuesday.
   Under an amendment to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act,
the communications and information minister also may exempt
publications from having to apply for a permit, the ministry said
in a statement.
   It said Communications and Information Minister Yeo Ning Hong
``will exempt 14 foreign publications which do not report regularly
on Singapore and have not interfered in Singapore's domestic
affairs.''
   The act is not intended to curb the circulation of foreign
publications or the free flow of information, the statement said.
   ``It is meant to overcome problems encountered with a small
number of off-shore publications which report on Singapore
regularly.
   ``Some of these publications had built up sizeable circulations
in Singapore and attempted to play the same role in Singapore
politics as they did in their own countries, taking sides and
influencing events,'' it added.
   Th exempted publications are Time magazine, the Economist, the
International Herald Tribune, International Express, USA Today, the
Sunday Express, the Financial Times, Newsweek, the Asahi Shimbun
satellite edition, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun Asian edition, the
Yomiuri Shimbun, Bangkok Shuho Japanese, Joongang Daily News of
South Korea and the Thai-language Thai Rath, the statement said.
   The government has restricted the circulation in Singapore of
the newspaper Asian Wall Street Journal and the weekly magazine Far
Eastern Economic Review. But both Hong Kong-based publications
since have decided on their own to halt sales here.

<HEAD>Kyowa, Saitama Banks Plan to Merge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kyowa Bank Ltd. and Saitama Bank Ltd. announced
Tuesday they have agreed to merge effective next April 1, creating
what would be Japan's eighth largest bank with $178 billion in
deposits.
   The new bank will have 459 branches, including 16 overseas, and
a work force of 15,502, the two banking companies said in a
statement.
   ``We consider our mission to be to become the most excellent
bank, respected by society, in the retail field ... taking
advantage of mutual tradition and merits,'' Takeo Masuno, president
of Saitama Bank, said at a news conference.
   Kosuke Yokote, president of Kyowa Bank, joined him at the news
conference to announce the merger, which is subject to approval by
the Finance Ministry, the Fair Trade Commission and Japan's central
bank.
   A statement by Saitama Bank said the merger would help
strengthen management to cope with liberalization and
internationalization of Japan's financial markets.
   The deal would be the second involving major Japanese banks in
the past year.
   In April, Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank merged, becoming
Japan's second-largest bank in terms of deposits with 43,539
billion yen, or $335 billion.
   The largest bank in Japan is Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank with deposits
of 46,946 billion yen, or $361 billion.
   Yasushi Mieno, a Bank of Japan governor, said he expects the
merger of Kyowa Bank and Saitama Bank to contribute to the strength
of the Japanese banking industry.
   In a news release, Mieno called the merger significant because
the merger appears to have been spurred by deregulation of the
Japanese banking industry and increased competition from abroad.
   Mieno said the merger appears to be aimed at enabling the banks'

<HEAD>Silicon Valley Firms Resist Recession, But Tighten Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economic crisis in the Northeast has
stayed out of Silicon Valley so far, defying the doomsayers on Wall
Street. But fears of a recession have clearly arrived.
   Remembering the hard times in 1985 and 1986, when bloated
Silicon Valley companies laid off tens of thousands of workers, the
operative phrase for most firms here these days is ``tighten up.''
   Companies are avoiding unnecessary trips, watching the cost of
meals, trimming inventory and work force. Lavish Christmas parties
are out.
   Computer and chip companies in this high-tech mecca have been
bracing for a recession for months, although there is still no
strong evidence that a major downturn in the electronics business
is imminent.
   Sales overall are up from a year ago, inventories are down, and
there are no big layoffs, despite pockets of trouble.
   Cash is king. Apple Computer Inc. is sitting pretty on a $1
billion hoard - built up from $800 million a year ago - to get
through future economic bumps.
   Apple Chairman John Sculley says the only people who aren't
acknowledging an oncoming recession are government economists. He
and other Silicon Valley leaders have been preparing for a slowdown
by cutting manufacturing and sales costs and lowering prices to
attract buyers.
   ``Entering a recession, it's better to be coming out with more
aggressively priced items than high-end items,'' said Apple
spokesman Christopher Escher. ``Our newest Macintoshes are
positioned well for a tighter economic situation.''
   Although fat work forces are out, companies here have been
avoiding heavy layoffs.
   ``Premature layoffs have mostly been a New England phenomenon,''
said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in
Los Angeles. ``Unlike California, that area is really in a serious
recession.''
   Hewlett-Packard Co. slimmed down a bit, from 95,000 workers to
92,000, so far this year and it continues to cut back by attrition.
It also plans to close four extra days with mandatory vacations
between Christmas and New Year's Day to save operating costs and
remove days off as a liability on its books.
   National Semiconductor Corp. restructured this summer and cut
jobs from 32,000 to 30,000. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is expected
to cut about 1,200 jobs by year's end.
   In each of those cases, though, the cuts are related to the
distinct business conditions impacting the companies. As a whole,
the computer and chip industries here are holding off a major
downturn.
   ``In the last couple of months there's been a general
tightening,'' said Fred Zieber of Dataquest Inc., a high-tech
market research firm in San Jose. ``There's a lot of concern among
management about the near-term future because they just don't know
what sort of recession there may or may not be.
   ``It's been more of a management control reaction, more
anticipation than reality. The numbers, by and large, don't support
the concern.''
   Unlike the hard times that have hit the Northeast, especially
along the high-tech corridor of Route 128 in Massachusetts, the
computer companies here are not heavily dependent upon military or
aerospace contracts, which have suffered in recent years. In
Silicon Valley, the computer companies focus more on workstations,
personal computers and peripherals.
   One sign that things may get worse came earlier this month when
Businessland Inc., a San Jose-based retail firm, reported a $19.8
million loss for its first fiscal quarter and said it would lay off
780 people, or 20 percent of its work force, by year's end.
   David Norman, Businessland's chief executive officer, attributed
the revenue drop to industry price-cutting, new product
introductions and sluggish capital equipment spending by
corporations.
   Apple's new lower-priced Macintoshes appear to be selling
briskly, and sales are good at Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems
Inc. and other computer companies. Sun is expected to receive a
boost from the Sparcstation 2 line recently introduced. The
graphics workstations, which range in price from $14,995 to
$49,995, are far more powerful and versatile than the bestselling
Sparcstation 1.
   Computer chip orders rose modestly through the summer,
increasing 9.8 percent in September alone over a year ago. They're
expected to keep increasing into next year.
   ``The statistics at this point do not indicate a recession in
the semiconductor industry,'' said Tom Beermann, spokesman for the
trade group Semiconductor Industry Association.
   A recent SIA forecast estimated worldwide chip sales would grow
12.5 percent in 1991, following a year of relatively flat growth
from 1989's $48.8 billion to about $49.5 billion this year. If war
breaks out in the Middle East, the group estimated chip sales would
grow by a more moderate 6.25 percent next year.
   But those rosy numbers mask a severe drop in sales of memory
chips, which are down 18 percent this year, according to Dataquest.
The drop there is mostly hurting the Japanese manufacturers who
dominate the memory market.
   Silicon Valley chipmakers who specialize in more advanced
devices are benefiting from a 12 percent rise in microprocessor
sales, 7 percent in logic chips and 7 percent in analog chips.
   ``The chip and computer industries may be just fine overall, but
that doesn't mean there isn't a lot of pain in a lot of
companies,'' said Dataquest's Zieber. ``I think you'll have a tough
market for awhile but not one that completely falls apart. If
there's a debacle coming, it's not real evident so far.''
   Inventories of semiconductors are relatively flat, and
inventories of computers are up only slightly, Zieber said.
   ``By historical standards they're both a little below average,
which is good,'' he said. ``If you get too much inventory, then you
have to cut back twice as far if a recession sets in.''
   Even companies that are flush, such as Intel Corp., maker of the
popular chips that act as the brains of International Business
Machine Corp.'s personal computers and IBM ``clones,'' are yielding
to the economic uncertainties.
   ``We're looking at critical hires only,'' said Pam Pollace, an
Intel spokeswoman. ``We're seeking to be conscientious about
internal controls, inventory, spending. We're asking people to
avoid unnecessary travel and expenses.''
   Intel's earnings remain strong, rising to $172 million in the
third quarter from $72 million a year ago.
   Intel is boosting spending for research and development, from
$422 million last year to $600 million this year, Pollace said,
``because in this business you need to continue that to keep moving
ahead with the technology.''
   Advanced Micro Devices lost $23.7 million in the last two
quarters and expects to post another loss in the current quarter.
But the company is cautious about laying off workers because it
believes its long-term prospects are solid.
   The company recently completed a $200 million development center
and this past week introduced a microprocessor to compete against
Intel's hot-selling 80386 microprocessor.
   ``We've been doing things to react to our own business
conditions, which has had the same effect on us as a recession,''
said AMD spokesman John Greenagel. ``AMD has not performed as well
as the semiconductor industry as a whole for some time. The actions
we've taken we'd have to take regardless of the economic
conditions.''

<HEAD>Chicago Title to Swallow Ticor, a Major Competitor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago Title and Trust Co., the largest U.S.
title insurer, announced plans to purchase its biggest competitor,
Ticor Title Insurance Cos.
   The merger would create an almost $1 billion per year company.
Chicago Title's revenues were about $561 million in 1989 and the
Ticor companies' were $408 million, said Joann Shanley, spokeswoman
for Ticor's parent Westwood Equities Corp.
   Chicago Title, a unit of Alleghany Corp. in New York, said
Monday the deal is expected to close during the first quarter of
1991, subject to approval by regulators and other conditions.
   No antitrust or other difficulties were expected to interfere
with the purchase, Ms. Shanley said.
   The deal follows a consolidation trend among title insurers, who
check property records and guarantee to buyers and lenders that a
seller of property actually owns it.
   Ticor, once the largest title insurer, has lost money recently,
as has the $4 billion industry in general. Price squeezing, claims
inflation and sagging real estate markets have contributed to the
problems.
   A previous agreement to buy Ticor by General Motor Corp.'s data
processing unit fell apart last month, reportedly because Ticor's
problems were worse than anticipated.
   Ticor is privately owned and doesn't disclose profit and loss
figures. But Ms. Shanley acknowledged it lost money in 1989.
   ``The same would be the case in 1990, especially with the real
estate situation the way it is,'' she said.
   The title insurance industry reported losses on operations of
$112 million in 1988 and $154 million in 1989, although investment
income cushioned the losses, according to the American Land Title
Association.
   Ticor will become the fourth of the largest 12 companies in the
industry to go out of business or be taken over since 1987. Chicago
Title's chief executive, Richard P. Toft, last month predicted
further consolidations.
   Toft and other Chicago Title officials declined to discuss any
details of the purchase Monday.
   The Ticor title insurers - Ticor Title Insurance Co. of
California, Ticor Title Insurance Co. and New York-based Ticor
Title Guarantee Co. - are based in Los Angeles along with Westwood
Equities.
   Westwood also owns Ticor Realty Tax Services, which handles the
impound accounts in which taxes are placed and then forwarded to
the government when property is sold. TRTS accounted for a bit more
than a quarter of Westwood's $549 million in 1989 revenues. It's
not being bought by Chicago Title.

<HEAD>Hotel Chain Says It's Restructuring Debt, Halting Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Days Inns of America Inc. says it is halting all
principal and interest payments until the hotel chain can complete
a restructuring of $744 million in debt, much of it in high-yield
bonds.
   Officials of the Atlanta-based company maintained that its
day-to-day operations are sound. Days Inns President John D.
Snodgrass said he was confident the restructuring could be worked
out by early 1991.
   Snodgrass said the company's debt structure, high interest rates
and short amortization schedules, rather than its operations were
the cause of problems.
   ``If you look at the operating side of the company, it's
extremely healthy,'' he said.
   Reliance Group Holdings, which sold the chain to New York-based
Tollman-Hundley Hotels in 1989, accumulated much of the debt.
   The 1,100-unit chain, which marks its 20th anniversary Thursday,
said Monday it has not made recent payments of principal and
interest related to about $325 million of long-term and short-term
obligations. It is paying an average interest rate of 14 percent.
   The company would not identify its major debt holders but said
fewer than 10 own about half of the debt currently in default.
There are a total of about 200 debt holders, Snodgrass said.
   Days Inn said it is working with the major debt holders as well
as with an undisclosed New York investment banking firm to
restructure the debt.
   Following the company's announcement Monday, Moody's Investors
Service lowered its rating on Days Inns' subordinated debt of about
$149 million from CAA to CA. Moody's said the lowering reflected an
overcapacity in the lodging industry as well as the economy's
slowdown.
   Snodgrass said the chain's reservations are up 9.5 percent over
last year and the company is paying its vendors on a timely basis,
within 60 days. The company has franchise agreements for 350 new
hotels in the next two years.

   The stock market opened mixed today as traders
seemed to pause after back-to-back bullish sessions that had
coincided with sharply falling oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.71 at
2,535.64 after the first half hour of trading.
   But gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 512 up, 423
down and 514 unchanged.
   ``My guess is it is the pause that refreshes,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``We've had a nice
100-point run in the last two sessions. I think we're seeing a

   Traders have been more optimistic lately as they decided oil
prices seemed to have peaked and inflationary pressures were

   Among actively traded issues, American Express was up &rsqb; at 22,
Philip Morris was down | at 48}, IBM was unchanged at 113, and

value index was up .28 at 295.06.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 51.74 points

<DATELINE>GLOVERSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Hornung is a vinyl romantic.
   He plays albums at home and keeps a record player in his office.
He also has resisted pleas from his 21-year-old son to ``get with
it'' and buy a compact disc player.
   As director of operations at MCA Manufacturing Corp.'s record
and tape plant in Gloversville, N.Y., Hornung runs one of the few
remaining plants in the country that manufacture vinyl records.
   ``It's sad to think there may come a day when records are no
longer made,'' Hornung said. ``Demand for vinyl has fallen off, but
we're still producing it. It's still selling.''
   The 37-year-old plant in this old tannery town in upstate New
York manufactures cassette tapes and vinyl records for MCA, whose
artists include Elton John, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Bobby
Brown and the Oak Ridge Boys.
   MCA also owns Motown Records and the jazz-oriented GRP Records
label in addition to Universal Pictures and the Universal City
Theme Park in California. The company recently purchased Geffen
Records in a deal expected to be completed by early next year.
   The Gloversville plant is the only place in the country where
MCA makes vinyl records, which account for 20 percent of music
recording sales nationwide, according to Hornung. He said it might
be the only place in the country where 45s are still made.
   Hornung, who's worked at the Gloversville facility for 20 years,
believes that records will disappear at some point in his lifetime.
   ``I think we're getting closer to that point,'' said Mick
Borthick, head of production at Chrysalis in New York.
   Several developments this year seem to indicate that. Chrysalis
and PolyGram announced that with a few rare exceptions, all their
new releases will be on cassette tape and CD only.
   Warner-Elektra-Atlantic reported that it will cut out more than
40 percent of its vinyl catalogue. That means 1,205 album titles
owned by the conglomerate will no longer be available on records.
   The Tower Records chain said it will no longer sell 7-inch
single records because several major labels won't accept returns on
unsold records.
   ``Record buyers are in the minority,'' said Robert Cohen,
manager of the Finyl Vinyl record store in New York. ``Vinyl is
becoming a specialty item.''
   In 1982, the year before CDs were introduced, manufacturers
shipped out 244 million records for sales of $2 billion, according
to the Recording Industry Association of America. Last year,
manufacturers shipped out only 34 million records for sales of $220
million.
   By comparison, 207 million CDs were shipped out in 1989 for
sales of $2.6 billion, the association said. About 446 million tape
cassettes also were sold.
   ``CDs and cassettes have really taken over,'' Borthick said.
   He noted that cassette players are favored by youths and most
other music lovers have been seduced by the clearer sounds of CDs.
   Chrysalis, with annual sales of $70 million worldwide, said
recent releases by Sinead O'Connor and Billy Idol sold few record
albums in this country, slightly more than 1 percent. The rest were
CD and cassette sales.
   ``You can understand why we're not anxious to manufacture
records,'' Bothrick said. It's not economical to operate pressing
plants when they're only turning out a few records, he said.
   Merchants said they would rather discontinue records so they
could have more room for cassettes and the more expensive CDs.
Records account for only 2 percent of sales in the 82-store Record
World, so vinyl is being phased out, said Mitch Imber, purchasing
director.
   That's left many feeling that records are being killed off
prematurely.
   ``Manufacturers are looking to remove the option of buying
records from consumers,'' said Cohen, of the Finyl Vinyl record
store. ``They have abandoned a big segment of the record-buying
community in order to push the more expensive CD format.''
   Merchants who still want to carry records said return policies
and reordering difficulties are putting pressure on them to relent.
   Cohen said he's charged anytime he returns an album, whether
it's defective or not. There's no penalty for cassette and CD
returns.
   Hornung is paying close attention to the changing times. But he
said his plant, which distributes tapes and records throughout the
Northeast and as far west as Ohio, isn't planning to manufacture
CDs.
   Instead, the Gloversville plant is expanding its tape production
capabilities. The facility is the No. 3 producer of tapes in the
country, behind Warner-Elektra-Atlantic and CBS Records, Hornung
said.
   ``We've shrunk vinyl operations and expanded into this,''
Hornung said.
   The factory still makes 7-inch and 12-inch records and will
continue to do so as long as there's demand for them, Hornung said.
   ``Bless them,'' said Cohen, whose store caters to vinyl
romantics, especially with hard-to-find records from the 1960s.
``And if we're the last store still selling these 12-inch pieces of
black plastic, then that's just fine with me.''

<TEXT>
   Koala Springs International, maker of
popular juice-based bottled water products, today recalled all of
its beverages from retail shelves and warehouses in the United
States.
   Company president John Chatham said tests revealed ``minute
traces of contaminants in some of our product at levels between 11
and 18 parts per billion.'' It did not specify what the
contaminants were.
   The tests were conducted last weekend and today in Tallahassee,
Fla., the company said. The levels of contaminants pose no
significant health risk to the general public, the company said,
adding that it decided to withdraw its product ``so as to avoid any
possible concern by retailers or consumers.''
   The company ordered retailers and distributors to halt shipment
of all Koala Springs juice-based products and to hold supplies in
warehouses until further notice. Stores were ordered to remove all
stock from retail shelves and return it to warehouses for storage.
   ``We deeply regret any inconvenience that this action may have
caused, but it is the most responsible course of action that we can
follow at this time,'' said Chatham in a written statement.

<HEAD>Ad Agency Quits Volvo Account In Wake of Disputed Volvo Ad</HEAD>

   The carmaker Volvo's advertising agency quit
today, saying it was taking responsibility for the bogus commercial
depicting a Volvo that resisted the stomping of a big pickup truck
while other cars collapsed.
   Scali McCabe Sloves Inc. said it was resigning as the ad agency
for Volvo Cars of North America because of questions raised about
the production of the so-called ``Monster Truck'' commercial for
the Swedish car.
   The ad showed a Volvo was the only car left standing a pickup
truck with oversized tires ran over a row of cars.
   It was later discovered the Volvo had been reinforced and the
other cars were weakened before the ad was shot.
   The ad agency's chairman, Marvin Sloves, said in announcing the
agency was resigning the account that agency executives had worked
for 23 years to establish Volvo as ``one of the most respected and
admired brand names in North America.''
   As a result, he said felt agency executives wanted to insure
that ``our actions in no way diminish the value and reputation of
the Volvo name.''
   ``To this end it is imperative that we resign and accept
ultimate responsibility for what happened. Now is not the time to
point fingers at anyone,'' he said.
   He said it had been established that the issue was ``only the
making of this advertisement'' and not the strength or durability
of Volvo cars, the integrity of the car company or any previous
advertising.
   A call was placed to Volvo for comment on the development, but
it was not immediately returned.
   Under pressure from the state attorney general of Texas, Volvo
announced last week it had pulled the commercial and would run
corrective ads because it turned out the Volvo in the ad had been
reinforced with steel or wood.
   At the same time, Volvo admitted that those who made the
commercial had removed supports in the other cars in the ads.
   The automaker, which admitted no wrongdoing in settling the
dispute with the attorney general in Texas, said the ad was a
dramatization of a 1988 Vermont event and should have stated it was
a dramatization. But the commercial carried no such disclaimer.
   Volvo said the modifications were made to the cars to ensure the
crew's safety while making the ad.

   Panhandle Eastern Corp. has chosen the former
president of a company it acquired as its new chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Dennis R. Hendrix, former president of Texas Eastern Corp.,
succeeds Philip J. Burguieres, who resigned for unspecified health
reasons less than a year after taking the posts.
   Burguieres, a board member since 1984, had been handpicked by
former Panhandle chairman Bob Hunsucker to succeed him when he
retired at the end of 1989. Burguieres also is giving up his seat
on the board.
   Neither Burguieres nor Hendrix would comment on the change
Monday. Panhandle spokesman James W. Hart Jr. said Burguieres'
illness had not responded to medication, but was not
life-threatening and was reversible with several months of
treatment.
   During the last year, Burguieres was credited with taking some
tough but necessary steps to help Panhandle. He cut capital
spending from about $450 million to $250 million and streamlined
management of the merged organization, said First Boston analyst
John Olson.
   Burguieres cut the company's annual dividend from $2 to 80 cents
a share in July because profits weren't covering the dividend, a
move expected to save more than $100 million a year.

<TEXT>
   Iran and Qatar will invest $3 billion to
tap the offshore Pars gas field, one of the biggest in the world,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a deputy oil minister
identified as M. Naimi as saying the joint project would be running
by the the end of 1994.
   The gas reserves lie beneath Iranian and Qatari waters in the
Persian Gulf.
   Naimi said the gas will be exported to Eastern and Western
Europe. He said Iran intends to pump the gas through a pipeline it
will build through Turkey.
   Iran, which already sits atop of the world's second largest gas
reserves, after the Soviet Union, currently pumps up to 3 billion
cubic meters of natural gas to the Soviets a year.

   The stock market was down slightly this
afternoon in what seemed like a pause after back-to-back bullish
sessions that had coincided with cheaper oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.95 at
2,535.40 with two hours left to trade on Wall Street.
   Decliners outnumbered gainers about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 763 down, 695
up and 498 unchanged. In early trading, the market had been
fluctuating in a narrow range.
   ``My guess is it is the pause that refreshes,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``We've had a nice
100-point run in the last two sessions. I think we're seeing a
little profit-taking.''
   Traders have been more optimistic lately as they decided oil
prices seemed to have peaked and inflationary pressures were
easing, Metz said. But oil was moving back up today, and some
analysts believed that had put a brake on the stock market.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 113.15 million shares as of 2
p.m.
   Among actively traded issues, Philip Morris was down | at 48},
Federal National Mortgage was up &rsqb; at 32&rsqb;, American Express was up

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down .71 at 173.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market

<HEAD>Government Wants To Introduce More Telephone Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it wants to introduce
more competition into Britain's multibillion-dollar
telecommunications market and end the control held by giant British
Telecom.
   British Telecommunications PLC, which the government privatized
six years ago, controls about 97 percent of the local telephone
market. The rest is held by Mercury Communications Ltd.
   Trade Secretary Peter Lilley outlined to the House of Commons
the government's proposal for allowing new players into the local,
domestic long distance and international markets.
   Foreign companies would be allowed to apply for licenses in all
three telecommunications categories, the trade department said.
   The new competitors progressively would be allowed equal access
to British Telecom's existing British infrastructure, Lilley said.
   Lilley also said government price constraints on British Telecom
should remain in place until 1993. Under the constraints set by the
Office of Telecommunications, the company can raise no more than
4.5 percent below the rate of inflation, which is 10.9 percent.
   `This country has already benefited from our policies of
privatization and competition and because of the U.K.'s lead we are
becoming a telecommunications hub for Western Europe,'' Lilley
said.
   ``The government is committed to reinforce this lead and to
ensure that consumers have the widest possible services at the most
competitive price,'' he said.
   British Telecom said it welcomed the government's ``general
thrust'' for greater competition and choice. But it was
disappointed that cable television companies would be allowed to
continue their monopoly in providing entertainment services.
   Lilley said British Telecom would be barred from that market for
the next 10 years.
   British Telecom has 19 million residential and 6 million
business customers. It had after-tax profit of 1.54 billion pounds,
or $3 billion, in its last fiscal year, on revenue of 12.3 billion
pounds ($24 billion).
   The government invited comment on its plan until Jan 14.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Tuesday's auction to their lowest level in more
than two years.
   The Treasury Department sold $10 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.05 percent, down from 7.07 percent
last week. Another $10 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.02 percent, down from 7.05 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 6.94
percent on Aug. 8, 1988, and six-month bills averaged 6.99 percent
on July 11, 1988.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.28 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,821.80 and 7.38 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,645.10.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.35 percent last
week, down from 7.41 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>European Court Approves Ban on Hormones In Cattle Breeding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Court of Justice Tuesday approved
the European Community's 1985 ban on the use of hormones in cattle
breeding.
   The court ruled Tuesday that the ban was justified to allay
health concerns of European consumers, as expressed by the European
parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and various
European consumers associations.
   The Luxembourg court at first voided the European directive,
mainly for legal technicalities, and the EC immediately revised its
text to comply with the court objections.
   European producers of pharmaceutical and veterinary products
then attacked the ban before the court, claiming there was no
scientific evidence the use of hormones was harmful to humans.
   The 1985 ban led to U.S. trade reprisals. The U.S. government
claimed its cattle breeders were losing $100 million worth of
exports because of the ban, and slapped tariffs on various European
food exports.
