   Residents voted Monday to keep Gallup's
feisty mayor, who once threatened to erect billboards proclaiming
his city the nation's drunken-driving capital, in office for the
remaining 11 months of his term.
   The vote to recall Mayor Ed Munoz was 1,995 to 2,135. Opponents
needed 2,246 ballots to oust the 62-year-old Democrat.
   ``This tells me that the people of Gallup want me to continue to
address the city's alcohol problem,'' said the longtime mayor of
this city on the edge of a huge Indian reservation.
   The 50 percent voter turnout was about 15 percent higher than
expected, said City Clerk Rosa-Lena Chavez. Gallup has 7,218
registered voters.
   Munoz said he was not upset that 1,995 voters wanted him out of
office.
   ``It tells me that people associated with the liquor industry
carry a lot of clout and that other people want to continue to live
in denial,'' he said. ``People that have drinking problems want to
continue drinking and continue to live in denial.''
   Munoz contends the liquor industry was behind the effort to
drive him from office because of his campaigns against alcohol
problems in Gallup.
   Recall organizer Linda Tiley said she hoped the vote sends a
message to Munoz. ``I hope he sees by the number of votes against
him that there are a lot of people who disagree with his views,''
Ms. Tiley said.
   ``I don't feel that the recall was a total failure just because
we didn't win,'' she said. ``Maybe now, people will start to pay
more attention to city government.''
   Recall organizers had said they were fed up with Munoz'
confrontational style, and accused him of using his position to
help friends. They noted that he has three times offered to step
outside to settle differences during City Council meetings.
   ``If I had been charged with malfeasance or something like that,
then I wouldn't feel good,'' Munoz said earlier. ``But I feel good
about this.''
   Ms. Tiley said the mayor's proposal in February for billboards
depicting a car on a road paved with skulls was just the last straw.
   The billboards, 20 miles west of Gallup on the Arizona state
line, would have told visitors that lifelong New Mexico residents
have an 86 percent chance of being involved in an alcohol-related
traffic accident.
   ``The rest of the country now thinks this is nothing but a town
of drunks,'' said Ms. Tiley, a skin-care consultant and part-time
waitress and bartender.
   Munoz retracted the billboard proposal, saying it was intended
to get the attention of state legislators after they failed to act
on liquor-law reforms the mayor supported. He has proposed closing
all drive-up liquor windows and halting sales before 11 a.m., and
persuaded voters to impose a liquor tax to pay for alcohol
treatment.
   Munoz was mayor from 1958 through 1969 and is in the middle of
his second consecutive two-year term.
   He is challenging state Rep. Dominic Ferrari in the June
Democratic primary election, and has said he won't seek another
term as mayor no matter what happened Monday.
   Ms. Tiley rejected the mayor's accusation that the recall was
backed by the liquor industry. She said the campaign, organized
with the help of a mail carrier and three of her co-workers at the
Powder Puff beauty salon, hasn't taken any money from
alcohol-related businesses.
   ``Alcohol has nothing to do with it at all,'' Ms. Tiley said.
``It's his tactics. We don't like the way he runs things.''
   Examples, she said, included Munoz interceding on behalf on an
acquaintance in a zoning matter and three times offering to step
outside a council meeting to settle a dispute.
   The mayor doesn't deny challenging people to fights.
   ``When they make personal slanders against me, I'll threaten
them,'' he said.
   Of allegations he helped his friends, Munoz said: ``I'm
responsive to people in the community, as a mayor should be. When
someone needs help, I try to help them.''
   Ms. Tiley contends that Gallup's liquor problems are no worse
than any other city's, but says Munoz, by drawing attention to
drinking, has hurt tourism.
   Gallup, population 24,600, is on the edge of the West
Virginia-size Navajo reservation, which sprawls across three states
and is home to 165,000 people. Alcohol is banned on the
reservation, so Navajos who wish to drink legally must go to nearby
cities like Gallup.
   The National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse found in
a one-time study that the Gallup area's rate of alcohol-related
deaths per 100,000 people was nearly six times the U.S. average
from 1975 to 1979. In 1987, the National Safety Council reported
that New Mexico was the nation's per capita leader in traffic
deaths, and that year McKinley County, which includes Gallup, was
worst among New Mexico counties for severe alcohol-related crashes.
   In 1988, city police threw 26,222 people in ``drunk tanks'' to
sober up, many of them multiple offenders.

   A man who stocked his home with more than
6,000 pints of homemade wine accidentally cut himself on a bottle
and bled to death, authorities say.
   Junius Huggins, 67, cut a four-inch gash across his left wrist
and severed an artery as he apparently tried to tighten or remove
the top of one of the wine bottles April 10, said county coroner
Jimmy Gregg.
   He left a trail of blood to his neighbor's home, where he sought
help, and died behind the house, Gregg said.
   Police confiscated 6,100 pints of wine in bottles, kegs and jugs.
   ``We have no proof he had intentions of selling it. For all I
know it could have been a hobby of his making wine,'' sheriff's
Capt. Wayne Jeffords said Monday.
   The shed at his home where the wine was stored was covered with
spray-painted biblical verses, and biblical quotations were
displayed around the property, but Jeffords said he didn't know who
put them there.

<HEAD>Sponsor of SAT Asks Court for Exemption From Truth-in-Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sponsor of the SAT is asking a federal court
to exempt the test from a state law requiring disclosure of
questions and answers.
   The College Board said Monday that the exemption, if granted,
would allow it to administer the Scholastic Aptitude Test more
often in New York state by holding down the cost of complying with
the decade-old truth-in-testing law.
   The law requires testmakers to make public test questions,
answers and related research reports. Such disclosures enable
students to check their answers or challenge questions they believe
are flawed or biased.
   New York and California are the only two states with
truth-in-testing laws. But since New York's law was passed, test
makers have voluntarily extended its provisions to test-takers in
all 50 states.
   The board's request for an injunction was filed Monday in
Syracuse. Joining with the board was the Educational Testing
Service, of Princeton, N.J., which administers the Scholastic
Aptitude Test and numerous other standardized tests.
   If the injunction is granted, disclosures of test questions and
answers will no longer be mandatory. But board spokesman Fred
Moreno said the testmaker would continue to voluntarily disclose
tests administered on the four existing New York test dates.
   The board would then add two new opportunities in December and
January each year for New Yorkers to take the SAT. There would also
be additional dates for New Yorkers to take the Graduate Record
Examination and the Test of English as a Foreign Language. But
tests taken on new dates would not be disclosed afterwards.
   In effect, the College Board said, that would mean New Yorkers
would have the same number of opportunities to take the tests as
students in most other states.
   The board reduced the number of test dates in New York shortly
after truth-in-testing was enacted, claiming that it had to do so
in order to keep the cost of the exam down.
   Blair Horner, a spokesman for the New York Public Interest
Research Group, which successfully lobbied for truth-in-testing,
said the College Board-ETS suit ``reveals their true character _ to
gouge students in order to maximize their profits.''
   But test publishers insisted they were not trying to subvert
truth-in-testing.
   ``We do not want to turn the clock back on test disclosure,''
said Greg Anrig, president of ETS in a telephone interview. He
added that he had gone on record on numerous occasions in support
of truth-in-testing.
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader called the lawsuit ``a big
mistake. This lawsuit will make the standardized testing industry
fraud a nationally visible issue for public discussion.''
   Cinthia Schuman, executive director of FairTest, a Cambridge,
Mass., group critical of standardized tests, called the action by
the College Board and ETS ``hypocrisy.''
   ``Why should your right to disclosure of a test depend on the
date that you take it?'' she said.
   The SAT is taken by about 1.6 million college-bound high school
students each year, and approximately 200,000 New York students.
   The way was paved for Monday's action when a federal court in
January ruled that disclosure provisions of New York's
truth-in-testing law conflicted with federal copyright law. That
case involved the MCAT, a medical school entrance exam.

<TEXT>
   ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' was No. 1 at
the box office for the third straight week, becoming the
highest-grossing independent film in U.S. history.
   ``Ninja Turtles,'' released by New Line Cinema, took in $73
million in its first three weeks, including $14.11 million last
week, according to figures Monday from Exhibitor Relations Co.
   Disney's ``Pretty Woman,'' a Pygmalion tale starring Richard
Gere as a powerful businessman and Julia Roberts as a streetwalker,
was second with $10.1 million.
   ``Ninja Turtles'' overtook Vestron's 1987 ``Dirty Dancing,''
which held the record for biggest North American box-office take by
an independently produced movie at $63 million.
   Otherwise, box-office business over the weekend was just fair.
   ``The Easter egg hunts cut into the kids a little bit,'' said
John Krier of Exhibitor Relations.
   In third place was the Tom Clancy techno-thriller ``The Hunt for
Red October,'' with ticket sales of $4.26 million. ``Ernest Goes to
Jail,'' the latest installment in the adventures of an obnoxious
bumpkin, was fourth with $4.25 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' New Line, $14.1 million,
2,377 screens, $5,917 per screen, $72.9 million, three weeks.
   2. ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $10.1 million, 1,707 screens,
$5,927 per screen, $59.3 million, four weeks.
   3. ``The Hunt for Red October,'' Paramount, $4.26 million, 1,702
screens, $2,503 per screen, $89.8 million, seven weeks.
   4. ``Ernest Goes to Jail,'' Disney, $4.25 million, 1,956
screens, $2,172 per screen, $12.6 million, two weeks.
   5. ``The First Power,'' Orion, $3.8 million, 1,336 screens,
$2,858 per screen, $11.7 million, two weeks.
   6. ``Crazy People,'' Paramount, $3.4 million, 1,389 screens,
$2,417 per screen, $4.2 million, one week.
   7. ``I Love You to Death,'' Tri-Star, $2.7 million, 1,095
screens, $2,425 per screen, $8 million, two week.
   8. ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Warner Bros., $2.2 million, 1,387
screens, $1,617 per screen, $90.4 million, 18 weeks.
   9. ``Cry Baby,'' Universal, $1.6 million, 1,236 screens, $1,255
per screen, $5.5 million, two weeks.
   10. ``The Gods Must Be Crazy II,'' Weintraub, $1.2 million, 321

<TEXT>
   His boyhood friends in Indonesia were
street peddlers, and his grandmother still lives in a mud-walled
house in Kenya. But Barack Obama is another world away, presiding
over the Harvard Law Review as the first black president in the
prestigious journal's 103-year history.
   The charismatic 28-year-old, ensconced in the halls where
tradition reigns, is taking aim at another custom: Obama's sights
are set on the South Side of Chicago, not on a U.S. Supreme Court
clerkship or a fast-track career with a cushy firm.
   ``I'm not interested in the suburbs. The suburbs bore me. And
I'm not interested in isolating myself,'' Obama said in a recent
interview. ``I feel good when I'm engaged in what I think are the
core issues of the society, and those core issues to me are what's
happening to poor folks in this society.''
   His passion is rooted in his background. He was born in Hawaii,
his father an Oxford- and Harvard-educated economist from the
African nation of Kenya, his mother a white anthropologist from
Kansas. Obama moved to Southeast Asia at age 2 when his parents
divorced and his mother married an Indonesian.
   Until the fifth grade, Obama attended Indonesian schools, where
most of his friends were the sons of servants, street peddlers and
farmers.
   Concern for Obama's education led his mother to return him to
Hawaii, where he attended public schools through high school. In
1983, he graduated from Columbia University with a degree in
political science.
   At a recent meeting in a Harvard cafeteria, his affinity with
the underdog was readily apparent.
   ``I lived in a country where I saw extreme poverty at a very
early age,'' Obama said. ``Parts of my family in Kenya remain very
poor. My grandmother still lives in a mud-walled house with no
running water or electricity.
   ``That's who I am, that's where I come from, not always
literally, but at least emotionally.''
   Obama entered Harvard Law School in 1988, and through a
combination of grades and a writing competition, was elected to
head the law review this February. He succeeded Peter Yu, a
first-generation Chinese-American.
   Obama cautions against reading too much into his election.
   ``It's crucial that people don't see my election as somehow a
symbol of progress in the broader sense, that we don't sort of
point to a Barack Obama any more than you point to a Bill Cosby or
a Michael Jordan and say `Well, things are hunky dory,''' Obama
said.
   ``There's certainly racism here. There are certain burdens that
are placed, more emotionally at this point than concretely,'' Obama
said.
   ``Professors may treat black students differently, sometimes by
being, sort of, more dismissive, sometimes by being more, sort of,
careful because they think, you know, they think that somehow we
can't cope in the classroom,'' he said.
   Obama sees the inner cities as the front lines of racism.
   ``It's critical at this stage for people who want to see genuine
change to focus locally. And it is crucial that we figure out how
to rebuild the core of leadership and institutions in these
communities,'' he said.
   For five years before law school, Obama took on that task in
Chicago.
   As the director of a program that tried to bring South Side
churches, unions and block associations together on projects, Obama
was not trying to solve local problems, he said. Instead he sought
to construct something more lasting _ a forum for the community to
speak with one voice.
   ``I'm interested in organizations, not movements, because
movements dissipate and organizations don't,'' Obama said.
   America suffered when the movements of the 1960s dissipated,
Obama said. Those movements succeeded in raising doubts about
harmful traditions of sexism and racism, but failed to offer a
viable alternative.
   ``Hopefully, more and more people will begin to feel their story
is somehow part of this larger story of how we're going to reshape
America in a way that is less mean-spirited and more generous,''
Obama said.
   ``I mean, I really hope to be part of a transformation of this
country.'' And the future of black people and of America generally?
   ``It depends on how good I do my job,'' he said.

<HEAD>Asian Elephant Birth Important Event For Zoo, Species Survival</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The amorous escapades of a 10,000-pound
Asian elephant named Indy have captured the attention of the zoo
world.
   The 18-year-old pachyderm has impregnated two females at the
Burnet Park Zoo. Babe is expected to deliver her baby around the
last week of April and Romani is due in July 1991.
   That's earth-shaking news for the continent's zoos, where just
62 calves have ever been born in captivity. It's also a sign of
promise for the 35,000 to 45,000 Asian elephants that remain in the
wild as an endangered species.
   ``North American zoos are getting serious about reproducing
elephants. The two pregnancies at Syracuse is evidence we are
making progress,'' said Tom Foose, conservation director for the
American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums.
   To highlight the importance of the twin pregnancies,
Jacksonville Zoological Park Director Dale Tuttle said there are
only six other zoos with pregnant Asian elephants. An elephant's
pregnancy lasts 22 months.
   Only 14 of the AAZPA's approximately 150-member zoos have the
facilities to breed Asian elephants, said Tuttle, coordinator of
the AAZPA's Species Survival Plan for Asian elephants.
   ``There are only 11 proven male breeders in captivity and just
12 females that have reproduced,'' said Foose. ``What's going on in
Syracuse is very impressive _ and very significant.''
   ``The survival of the species is dependent, in part, upon the
establishment and maintenance of viable breeding of captive
populations in North America. And that's where we come in,'' said
Burnet Park Zoo Director Dave Raboy.
   Like the decision to have a child, starting an elephant family
is not a commitment entered into lightly.
   The zoo decided in 1979 that it wanted to breed elephants, said
curator Don Moore. It began by transforming the 350-square-foot
indoor pen that housed its one elephant, Siri, into a spacious
3,200-square-foot indoor-outdoor living area with a breeding barn.
   Romani was purchased in 1984 from a circus, which bought her
from an elephant orphanage in Sri Lanka. Indy, also an ex-circus
performer from Thailand, and Babe, a one-time gift to the U.S.
ambassador to Pakistan, came to Burnet Park in June 1985.
   With dual pregnancies and a virile male to make it worthwhile,
Burnet Park this year is spending $500,000 to thrust itself fully
into elephant breeding. The money will be used to further enlarge
and modify the zoo's elephant habitat.
   A single elephant can cost more than $50,000 and a suitable
habitat, hundreds of thousands more.
   ``There's no secret,'' said Roger Henneous, the senior elephant
keeper at the Washington Park Zoo in Portland, Ore., the nation's
premier Asian elephant breeder. ``In order to have babies you have
to accommodate adult males. You're talking a tremendous financial,
physical commitment to accommodate a mature male. Most places can't
or won't. It's that simple.''
   Washington Park Zoo, which has had 24 births in the past 28
years, has accommodations for three males among its 12-animal herd.
   Chuck Doyle, the senior elephant handler at Burnet Park, says
there are other important factors in elephant breeding, one of
which is luck.
   ``Copulation is a learned behavior among elephants. A female has
to see another couple mating, otherwise she won't allow the male to
breed her,'' said Doyle, who broke some ribs in attempts to get
Babe matched up with a mate. ``For three years, we watched Indy
push the females around without success. Finally, he pushed Babe
the right way. Romani needed less time because she witnessed Indy
and Babe.''
   Babe's calf, which will likely weigh about 200 pounds, will be
the first one born at Burnet Park. So it's understandable the zoo _
like a first-time parent _ has been excited about the pregnancy.
   ``I feel like I felt having our first child,'' said Moore.
   It's also a first for Babe, who at 36 may be the oldest
first-time Asian elephant mother in captivity. Trainers worry she
may not know what to do when she delivers.
   Babe has gained more than 1,150 pounds since she became pregnant
in June 1988. She tipped 7,450 when she was weighed by state police
on a truck scale Jan. 24.
   ``She's a very, very nervous animal, and she's not real thrilled
about people,'' Doyle said at one point, although he said she has
become more sociable during her pregnancy.
   Romani and Siri, who has resisted Indy's advances, will be
allowed to watch the birth, zoo officials said.

   A good song is hard to find is the new
tune being sung by Randy Travis.
   ``It's more competitive,'' the country music star said in a
recent interview. ``They're out there, but you really have to
search for them.''
   Travis, whose current hit is ``Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart,''
said that when he began recording five years ago, George Jones,
Merle Haggard and George Strait were his only rivals for
traditional country songs.
   ``Now you've got all those and you got Ricky Van Shelton and

   Donald and Ivana Trump patched things up long
enough to greet guests at a fund-raiser for AIDS victims.
   The Trumps later held hands as they ascended the stairway from
The Plaza hotel's grand ballroom to a suite where they shared an
Easter Sunday lunch with their children and in-laws, said a hotel
employee, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The appearance came amid an escalating legal battle over the
Trumps' split, which has been the subject of front-page stories in
New York tabloids since February.
   Mrs. Trump filed a lawsuit last month challenging Trump's claim
that she waived her right to half his fortune _ estimated at as
much as $5 billion _ in a series of postnuptial agreements, the
last signed in 1987.
   Trump's attorneys said the agreement, which gives Mrs. Trump $10
million and their $12 million mansion in Greenwich, Conn., is
ironclad.

   Students at Wellesley College are
protesting the selection of Barbara Bush as their commencement
speaker, saying the first lady hasn't earned the honor on her own.
   ``To honor Barbara Bush as a commencement speaker is to honor a
woman who has gained recognition through the achievements of her
husband, which contradicts what we have been taught over our years
at Wellesley,'' said a petition signed by 150 students and
presented to college President Nanerl Keohane.
   Anna Perez, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Bush in Washington, said
Sunday the first lady had no comment on the petition. Mrs. Bush
accepted an invitation to speak at commencement June 1 at the
2,200-student women's college.
   Laura Stavis, a Wellesley spokeswoman, defended the invitation.
   Mrs. Bush is ``involved in crucial issues, literacy, volunteer
programs for the needy and the homeless. I feel she speaks with her
own voice,'' Stavis said.

   France has had 11 citizens held hostage in the
Middle East, and it has managed to free them all.
   Commentators are asking whether it is a Gallic flair for
diplomacy or cynical deals with terrorists and their sponsors that
account for France's success.
   Is there, as one commentator here asked, a special French method
that can ``maneuver around the obstacle that others run into?''
   France makes an important distinction, said Bassma
Kodmoni-Darwish, an expert on French-Middle East relations: ``It
doesn't bargain with terrorist groups. It negotiates with states.''
   Each time hostages come home, top government officials find
themselves denying that France panders to terrorists.
   ``And it's true. It cannot be criticized'' on that count, said
Ms. Darwish, who works for the French Institute for International
Relations. ``But it is also a hypocritical nation.''
   France came under fire from many prominent Western newspapers
for lauding Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya for his role in securing
the release Tuesday of Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, her Belgian
companion and their child.
   The three were held for more than two years by the
Libyan-controlled Fatah-Revolutionary Council, headed by terrorist
Abu Nidal.
   Detractors draw little distinction between Abu Nidal's group and
Gadhafi.
   France did.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who praised Gadhafi's ``noble and
humanitarian gesture'' in seeking the trio's freedom and promised
improved relations, said France did not talk with the abductors.
   He denied that France traded three jetfighters _ returned to
Libya several weeks ago _ for the hostages.
   France negotiated the freedom of 10 of its 11 hostages in
1986-88, when conservative Premier Jacques Chirac was in power.
   Eighteen hostages of other nationalities remain in captivity in
Lebanon, including eight Americans. The longest-held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The U.S. government has publicly refused to negotiate for the
release of its hostages. But three Americans were freed in 1985-86
while U.S. arms were secretly delivered to Iran, which backs groups
holding hostages in Lebanon. Reports of the deliveries led to the
disclosure that some of profits were funneled to the Contra rebels
fighting the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
   French thank-yous that followed the release of its hostages were
never so effusive as those proffered to Gadhafi. But France has
also made concessions to Iran for earlier releases.
   All but one item on Iran's shopping list was met by the French,
who expelled top Iranian dissident Massoud Rajavi, normalized
relations with Iran and repaid part of a billion dollar debt dating
to the days of the Shah.
   The only outstanding demand is freeing Anis Naccache, serving a
life sentence in France for the attempted 1980 assassination of the
exiled former Iranian Premier Shahpour Bakhtiar.
   Gadhafi called for freedom for Middle Eastern ``political
prisoners'' in Europe, and it remains to be seen whether Naccache
will go free.
   ``The true French art is hypocrisy,'' columnist Richard Cohen
wrote this week in The Washington Post. ``The French prattle on
like a womanizer, saying whatever seems effective at the moment. At
this particular moment ... Gadhafi seems in line for the Legion of
Honor: He freed three hostages.''
   Hypocrisy was a word often used abroad each time France obtained
the release of hostages. But the French view themselves differently.
   ``There is here a certain resigned tolerance for half-truths or
half-lies for reasons of state, perhaps more so than elsewhere,''
the leftist daily Liberation said in an editorial.
   ``La raison d'etat'' is a famous phrase in France, used by
governments as an excuse to remain silent.
   The 1985 sinking of the Greenpeace flagship, the Rainbow
Warrior, in New Zealand, in which one person was killed, proved one
of France's biggest debacles in decades.
   International pressure eventually overcame ``reasons of state,''
and the truth came out. But polls at the time revealed a public far
more outraged by the bungling of French spies than by their
murderous task.
   France has shown concerned nations it was prepared to negotiate
to release hostages, said Ms. Darwish, but she added that each time
French hostages have been freed the political context was favorable.
   Public pressure was a determining factor in freeing French
hostages held by Iranian-backed groups, Ms. Darwish said.
   The last three hostages held by Iranian-backed groups were
released May 4, 1988, days before the presidential election. The
gambit did not work for Chirac, who lost to the incumbent Francois
Mitterrand.
   Chirac's government denied charges it made payments or promised
to free Naccache, as Iran claimed. The current Socialist government
says it can find no written record of any deals.
   In the latest release of hostages, the return of the three
Mirages held in France under an embargo was but a signal for change
in French-Libyan relations, she said. A more moderate stance by
Gadhafi over the past six months, including his willingness to
renew ties with Egypt, ripened the political climate.
   ``It is that evolution which is more important than the
hostages,'' she said. ``It's not just a deal. Libya has evolved.''
   ``We did not exchange three hostages for three Mirages, but for
two epithets,'' said one French official, referring to the words
``noble'' and ``humanitarian'' used to describe Gadhafi.
   In any event, it ``had to be done,'' said a Foreign Ministry
spokesman. ``It is the custom.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 15 years of fratricidal carnage,
living in Beirut has been reduced to survival. Real life, as other
people know it, is on hold.
   ``Peace has become more important than life, electricity more
important than the future and butane gas more important than
completing the school year,'' says Talal Salman, owner of the
leftist daily As-Safir.
   The Lebanese, whose disparate factions are sponsored by such as
Iran, Israel, Libya, Syria and Iraq, appear to have an insatiable
appetite for killing each other.
   No one knows for sure how many people have been killed or maimed
since the sectarian civil war began on April 13, 1975.
   Estimates of the number killed range up to 150,000. Doctors at
the American University Hospital say a total of 200,000 killed or
wounded probably is close.
   In the latest war-within-a-war, Christians are fighting
Christians.
   Rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's soldiers and Samir Geagea's militiamen
are battling for control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
north and east of Beirut, where two-thirds of the 1.5 million
Lebanese Christians live.
   Even the remarkable resilience of the Lebanese has been tested
to its limits by the long war, factional feuding, two Israeli
invasions and countless air strikes.
   For most of the last year, Beirut has had little or no water and
electricity. Civilian life has been conducted largely underground,
in basements and subterranean parking lots used as shelters from
artillery fire.
   ``What future is there any more?'' asked Antoine Mousa, a
Christian civilian. ``One works only to make enough money to cover
the expenses of repairing damage.''
   Fadi Koukou, who at 14 is one year younger than the war, has had
only three months of schooling since March 1989. Most of his time
has been spent in shelters.
   ``I don't think I'll be able to concentrate on my studies if
classes resume,'' he said. ``I haven't held a book for a long, long
time.''
   Koukou, who lives in the devastated Ashrafiyeh district of
Christian east Beirut, said he envied youngsters in Europe and the
United States because ``at least they don't have to spend hours
filling canisters with water and lug them up five flights of stairs
because the elevator's out.''
   Flashes remain of prewar Lebanon, when Beirut bustled with
vitality and a Phoenician gaudiness that made it the last of the
great Levantine cities, the playground of the Middle East.
   Lady Cochrane, who was Yvonne Sursock when she married an Irish
baronet, still holds elegant dinner parties in her colonnaded home
in east Beirut, as she did when she was the queen of Beirut society
before the war.
   It is her way of showing contempt for the danger and insanity
around her.
   Even so, Lady Cochrane, whose Greek Orthodox family has produced
generations of Lebanese notables, has stored her art works for
safekeeping.
   A Briton invited for dinner a few weeks ago, while an artillery
duel raged, said she ``sat at the head of the table as family
retainers brought in the family plate. She brushed aside all talk
of alarm or conflict. She had house guests ... and they were going
to have an enjoyable visit.''
   Regular water and power supplies to Beirut were cut off when the
Dbaye pumping station and the Zouk generating station, both in the
Christian enclave north the city, were hit in the early days of war
between Aoun and Geagea.
   ``Even if the fighting stopped today, it would take at least a
month to make enough repairs to the power plants to supply the city
with three hours of electricity a day,'' a municipal official said.
   The Syrians, who have 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon, provide 80
tank trucks to carry water from the south.
   The bloodletting between Aoun and Geagea is seen by many as the
ultimate madness in a country thought to have seen it all.
   Nearly 900 people have been killed and 2,500 wounded since Jan.
30, most of them civilians.
   Brother is pitted against brother. Sometimes, Aoun's soldiers
refuse to fire at other Christians or on streets where relatives
live.
   A Christian security source said an Aoun artillery battery was
ordered to fire 60 howitzer shells around Geagea's headquarters
near Beirut harbor.
   ``They did as they were ordered, but they defused nearly all the
shells before they fired them,'' he said.
   ``Only eight exploded. Most of the rest landed in the sea. They
simply found it unbearable to fire on fellow Christians.''
   A Christian woman expressed the civilian viewpoint:
   ``We've taken everything they've thrown at us for the last 15
years, but we never thought we'd have Christian fighting Christian
like this. It's insane. We're killing ourselves. It has to stop.''
   But it never does.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The euphoria surrounding Vaclav
Havel's fairy-tale journey from prison to the presidency is gone
and Czechoslovaks are back in the real world, arguing about the
economy, politics and the country's name.
   In January and February, intellectuals still exulted over the
end of censorship.
   The playwright president in Prague Castle and his entourage of
former dissidents and underground artists introduced a new morality
to politics at home and abroad. They were praised from Washington
to Moscow.
   Then domestic worries began to take over.
   Czechs and Slovaks, whose winter revolution was so smooth, split
on the question of whether ``socialist'' should be removed from
their republic's formal name. The matter still is not resolved.
   Government economists, facing a deadline in late April for an
agreement on drastic reforms, fell out over how quickly to adopt a
free market.
   Political rivals of the movements that led the revolution began
campaigning for the June 8 elections, the first free vote in four
decades.
   Havel, recovering from a hernia operation, acknowledged in a
national radio address April 1 that ``the time of elation and
happiness, stemming from the fact that everyone can say what they
want, has come to an end.
   ``The time has come when we will really have to do something
with the freedom,'' he declared.
   Transition from communism to democracy in Czechoslovakia and
elsewhere in Eastern Europe as been sudden and makeshift, marked by
ethnic problems, sharp decreases in worker output and a political
shift to the right.
   Czechoslovakia is better off than most.
   Disputes between Czechs and Slovaks have not become violent, as
ethnic strife has in Romania.
   The economy, while lagging behind countries Czechoslovakia
outstripped 50 years ago, is not burdened by heavy debt but
hundreds of potential Western investors flocking to Prague still
await laws liberalizing capital movement.
   Unlike Hungary, Czechoslovakia has not even begun establishing
such fundamental elements of capitalism as new banks and a stock
market.
   A senior economist with close ties to the government said reform
is hindered by a split between Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, who
wants to go all-out for capitalism, and others, including Havel,
who fear the social consequences.
   Havel's Civic Forum and its Slovak partner Public Against
Violence lead opinion polls for the elections, with about 20
percent. The Communists, who still claim 1 million party members in
a nation of 15.5 million, are second at about 11 percent.
   Conservative Christian Democrats won free elections in East
Germany and Hungary, however, and a similar coalition in
Czechoslovakia can count on strong support in heavily Roman
Catholic Slovakia. The visit of Pope John Paul II on April 21-22
also could provide a boost.
   The strong Communist showing has shaken Civic Forum into a
vigorous campaign against the Communist Party's right to keep
buildings and other assets seized during 41 years in power.
   Tens of thousands of people massed in Wenceslas Square this
week, for the first time since December, to support Civic Forum
demands that the party return the property.
   Otherwise, the ability to draw a crowd seems to be gone. Only 28
people showed up when Mayor Jaroslav Koran of Prague, appointed by
Havel, called for volunteers to clean up the city April 7.
   Most Czechoslovaks still are affected by old habits.
   In the past, the Communists threatened those who did not take
part in their parades and other rituals with loss of jobs or other
misfortunes. Four decades of that created a lack of civic awareness
yet to be overcome.
   Old habits also remain with former dissidents.
   Kveta Dienstbier, whose husband, Jiri, now is foreign minister,
was alarmed one February night by two mysterious men outside their
home.
   Dienstbier arrived, driving his official Mercedes. The two men
got out of their car. Scarred by years of surveillance and sudden
arrest, Mrs. Dienstbier screamed to her husband.
   The men were ministry drivers, waiting to collect the Mercedes.

<HEAD>South Carolina Psyche Battered by Hurricane Hugo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The physical wounds left by Hurricane
Hugo are slowly healing, but domestic strife and other signs of
stress are on the rise among South Carolina survivors of the killer
storm.
   Counselors and psychologists say some of the deepest emotional
wounds are only now emerging and may plague survivors for years in
areas of the state hardest hit by the Sept. 21 hurricane.
   Hugo claimed 29 lives and caused $5.9 billion damage in South
Carolina. Police, court and mental health officials also found a
toll on the psyche:
   _ During the first three months of 1990, 70 rapes were reported
in the Charleston area, an increase of 112 percent from a year ago.
   _ The number of domestic abuse and divorce cases filed in
Charleston County is up 17 percent so far this year, an unusually
large increase, court officials say.
   _ An estimated 20,000 South Carolinians suffering post-traumatic
stress syndrome are expected to develop long-term psychological
problems, mental health officials say.
   _ The number of people seeking help at the Charleston office of
the state Department of Alcohol and Drug Abuse was up 25 percent in
March compared with a year earlier.
   _ Studies show young children from the sea islands and Mount
Pleasant, which bore the brunt of the storm's 135 mph winds and
15-foot tidal surge, suffered a variety of emotional symptoms,
ranging from flashbacks to fear of storms.
   Officials note that not all of those statistical increases are a
direct result of the storm, but they say Hugo's emotional effects
are real and probably will grow worse in coming months as the start
of another hurricane season, on June 1, approaches.
   ``We'll see a continuing rise in the need for counseling,'' said
Dr. Sydney Jordan, an associate professor of psychology at the
Medical University of South Carolina. He said post-traumatic stress
usually takes about six months to set in.
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if
everybody in the family is under stress, it takes a lot less of a
stimulus to set people off,'' said Dean Kilpatrick, director of the
university's Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center.
   ``There's nothing about Hugo that made people feel kinder or
gentler toward their fellow man or spouse.''
   The state Mental Health Department's Hugo Outreach Team,
operated with a $1.5 million federal grant and 50 counselors,
counseled 2,300 people in the first three months of the year.
Officials suspect thousands more need help and don't know it.
   Support groups have found that many people don't recognize the
link between their problems and the storm, said Cathy Joyner of the
Hugo Outreach Team.
   ``They don't connect that they're unable to relate to their
spouse, or that their children are incorrigible, to the fact they
have had a significant life change,'' she said.
   The increase in reported rapes is probably associated with storm
stress, said Jane Wiggins of a victim support group called People
Against Rape.
   ``Anytime you have such a disruption of normal life _ the loss
of a home, loss of material goods, loss of jobs and the influx of
people _ it creates stress on the community and those prone to
violence are more easily triggered,'' she said.
   Divorce attorneys in Charleston are busy these days.
   ``People are certainly calling more,'' attorney Sandra Jones
said. She said she has had to book appointments two or three weeks
in advance, something that was not necessary before the storm.
   ``I'd venture to say it is people who were feeling some sort of
emotional problem in their marriage already,'' she said. ``They
were already on a thin line and just can't cope with the additional
frustration and pressure.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next time New York is looking for a new
nickname or something catchy to put on its license plates, how
about this: Tops in Wollastonite.
   That's right, folks, the Empire State _ which likes to think
itself unique in many ways _ is the wollastonite capital of the
United States, if not the world. In fact, New York was the only
state that mined the stuff last year. And the reason we know this
is the U.S. Bureau of Mines says so in its annual ``State Minerals
Summaries 1990.''
   Now maybe you're wondering what the heck wollastonite is. The
Bureau of Mines report doesn't say, so let's try Webster's
Dictionary.
   Ah, yes, wollastonite: ``a white, monoclinic mineral, CaSiO3, a
native calcium silicate.'' It was named for William H. Wollaston,
an English physicist.
   The Bureau of Mines report does offer tantalizing tidbits about
New York's wollastonite industry.
   ``In late 1988,'' it tells us, ``NYCO, a division of Processed
Minerals Inc., announced that they made a significant discovery of
wollastonite at Oak Hill, a few miles from NYCO's existing mine at
Lewis. Drilling at the site, which was initiated in 1986, indicated
that the new deposit would double the company's current reserves.''
   The federal report continues, albeit ungrammatically: ``During
the year, NYCO also introduced wollastokups, a chemically modified
for use in wollastonite product engineering thermoplastics for
fascia and body panels.''
   Fascia? Body panels? Wollastokups??
   Now, wait a minute.
   A fascia (plural fasciae), according to the dictionary, is ``a
flat strip,'' or ``an instrument panel or dashboard.'' And anyone
who has ever had a car accident knows what body panels are _ so we
may be getting warm.
   Todd Hutchins, a machine operator at NYCO's Lewis mine in the
Adirondacks, confirmed that the company sells wollastonite to car
manufacturers. In addition to being used in dashboards and body
panels, wollastonite reinforces car bumpers and is a component of
brake discs and pads, he said. Asked for a definition of
wollastokups, Hutchins said, ``It's the same stuff but it's
chemically treated to make it stronger.''
   While Hutchins knew he was working at the only wollastonite mine
in the United States, he was modest.
   ``We're something,'' he laughed. ``We're big-time in a town of
about 2,000.''
   Wollastonite has been found in California, Norway, Romania,
Mexico and Hungary _ but it's only mined in New York's Essex
County, according to the Encyclopedia Americana.
   Wollastonite is also used as a paint filler and in ceramic
products such as electrical insulators, tiles and porcelain, the
encyclopedia says.
   The mineral's namesake, William Hyde Wollaston, was quite a guy.
Born in 1766 in East Dereham, Norfolk, England, he earned a medical
degree from Cambridge University, according to the encyclopedia
entry written by L. Pearce Williams, a history professor from
Cornell University.
   ``Although possessed of the attributes of an excellent doctor _
intelligence, extraordinarily keen senses and superb manipulative
ability _ he was unhappy as a practicing physician and in 1800
turned to chemistry and physics,'' Williams says.
   Between 1803 and 1805, Wollaston focused on procuring platinum
soft enough to be shaped. ``His efforts were successful and his
fortune assured,'' Williams writes. ``From 1802 until his death, a
whole host of discoveries flowed from his laboratory.''
   For example, Williams tells us, Wollaston discovered two new
metals _ palladium in 1803 and rhodium in 1804. But Williams does
not say Wollaston discovered wollastonite, nor does he tell us who
decided to name the stuff after him.
   The mystery continues.

   Rebellious inmates at Strangeways
Prison started a serious fire early Monday, the 16th day of their
revolt, after accusing authorities of beating prisoners who had
surrendered.
   Prison officers entered the prison and had extinguished the
blaze an hour after it was set, a spokesman for the Home Office,
the department in charge of prisons. There was no indication that
any of the estimated dozen prisoners still on the loose had been
injured.
   ``There was a danger to life _ both to the prison officers who
went in to fight the fire and to the inmates on the roof,'' said
the spokesman. The fire started around 2:20 a.m., when heavy smoke
was seen billowing from the building.
   The prisoners said Sunday they would carry on their siege
another week, alleging that fellow rebels who had surrendered ``got
broken arms and legs.''
   They communicated their plans on a large board to friends,
relatives and sightseers in the streets below. In chalk was
written: ``We was coming down today but because some of the boys
departing last week got broken arms and legs we are staying one
more week.''
   In response, prison spokesman Ian Lockwood told a news
conference outside the prison:
   ``We categorically deny that there has been any action against
prisoners who have come down. We can't speculate where they have
heard these reports.
   ``We want to emphasize that with all prisoners coming down there
is a standard routine. Prisoners coming down are observed by
independent witnesses. ... The prisoners are then fed and
showered.''
   Lockwood, governor of Haverigg Prison in northwest England,
pressed into service at Strangeways, said negotiations that ended
Sunday morning had not resumed.
   ``The past 48 hours inside the prison have passed quietly with
only sporadic activity by prisoners and no direct confrontation,''
he said.
   Hundreds of prisoners rioted on April 1 in the overcrowded
prison, which was heavily damaged when inmates set fires and hurled
roof tiles at guards and firefighters.
   Most surrendered in the first few days. On Friday, officials
said two more prisoners had surrendered, leaving fewer than 13
inside the prison.
   Government officials said Strangeways disturbance sparked unrest
at eight other prisons in England and Wales April 8, ranging from a
sit-in at Leeds Jail to rioting at Dartmoor prison.

   Mounted on a wall in George Hommell's
tackle shop in this sportfishing haven is a plastic replica of a
13-pound bonefish President Bush caught a week before his
inauguration in 1989.
   It's the kind of monster some anglers wait a lifetime to catch.
But the self-proclaimed environment president threw the fish back
after measuring it.
   ``That fish is swimming around yet, probably 13{ pounds by
now,'' said Hommell, who is taking Bush to his best bonefish haunts
on Saturday and Sunday.
   Hommell, who has worked the sand flats and coral reefs around
the Florida Keys for 45 of his 65 years, pointed with pride last
week to the sparkling blue-green water under Backlash, the 17-foot
bonefishing boat he uses on fishing trips with the president.
   ``Everything he wants to do is conservation-minded. The first
time I fished with him he looked down at the water, nice and clear,
and said, `We have to make sure the next generations are able to
enjoy this,''' Hommell said.
   Hommell said Bush has become an expert at catching the muscular,
silvery fish during five outings with him since Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, a fellow angler, introduced them in 1980.
   A former Navy gunner, Hommell came to Florida after World War II
and got hooked on the Keys, where more than 400 species of fish
meant steady business for good fishing guides.
   He ran charters until he could open his own shop, World Wide
Sportsman, in 1968.
   Golfer Jack Nicklaus is one old customer, and baseball legend
Ted Williams hauled in a few prizes on Hommell's boat. But his
tackle business has expanded and now Bush is the only angler he
finds time to guide.
   ``Bush is a darn good fisherman,'' said Hommell. ``He'll listen
to you. He's very attentive. ... And he's patient. You might go
three, four hours without seeing a bonefish, and he's got the
patience for that.''
   Bush, talking to reporters the day after he caught the
13-pounder, said of the bonefish, ``These are, pound for pound, I'd
say, as fighting a fish as there is in the world. It really is
amazing what they do.''
   ``Then you take them in, weigh them and hold them in the water
and stroke them so that they can escape without some shark getting
them. It really is very wonderful,'' he said.
   Other resorts claim to have good bonefishing. But only in the
Keys do bonefish grow over 10 pounds, according to Sportfishing
magazine. At that size, only the most skillful anglers can haul in
the fish known as ``the ghost of the flats.''
   ``You've got to fish them like you're hunting deer. They're very
spooky,'' Hommell said.
   Bush has ordered his small army of Secret Service agents and
other federal officials to keep their boats and helicopters at a
distance, and other trappings of power are left at the dock,
Hommell said.
   ``He's just a regular fisherman, and he acts that way,'' he said.
   Hommell said he hasn't told Bush how he feels about allowing oil
drilling off southern Florida, a move locals say could destroy the
fragile Keys environment and shatter the state's tourism-based
economy.
   Bush has promised that drilling won't be allowed in ``highly
sensitive areas,'' but he has stopped short of calling for the ban
Florida's entire congressional delegation wants.
   ``He's basically down here to fish and I don't ask him about it
because I realize he only has a few days each year to do it,''
Hommell said.
   ``I try to make sure we talk fishing and look at the clean
surroundings, and he'll realize how important it is that it stays
that way.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Shopping for Foreign Aid on Capitol Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president is a little like the shopper who
consistently underestimates his shopping list and has to go to the
automatic teller machine to replenish his wallet.
   In the waning months of each fiscal year, he always finds
himself short of cash and has to ask Congress for more. Unexpected
expenses have arisen, or things cost more than anticipated.
   But unlike the teller machine, Congress has a mind of its own.
   You can have the money, lawmakers tell the president, but only
if you'll also take all this extra cash and use it for a list of
projects we would like.
   The scenario has been much the same since the birth of the
republic. The first supplemental appropriations bill, as the money
measures are called, was proposed in 1790. Deficit pressures have
led to an actual decline in their use in recent years.
   This year, President Bush asked Congress for a relatively modest
$870 million: $500 million to support Panama's fledgling new
democratic government, $300 million to do the same for Nicaragua,
and $70 million to pay for resettlement of a higher-than-planned
number of Soviet Jews emigrating to the United States.
   Because of budget rules, any new spending must be balanced by
cuts in some other part of the budget so the net package won't add
to the deficit. Bush proposed to pay for the new aid by trimming
the Pentagon budget.
   But the House wants the Pentagon to finance a good deal more
than Bush's package. House members added $510 million for food
stamps, $111 million for disaster assistance, $390 million for
veterans' assistance, $432 million for fire fighting, and a list of
other items, pushing the bill's total to $2.4 billion.
   The money bill is among the first items facing the Senate when
it returns this week from a two-week Easter recess. The Senate
Appropriations Committee is likely to take up the measure late in
the week.
   When that happens, the bill probably will grow some more.
   Already, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., has indicated he wants to
add $125 million in U.S. economic aid to help wean Andean farmers
from producing coca, the leaf used in making cocaine. Others likely
will seek additional spending on various domestic programs.
   ``It's seen as the only train leaving the station,'' said one
senior Senate aide.
   That is because of the urgency with which the White House sees
the funding bill. It is a ``must sign'' measure because of the aid
to Panama and Nicaragua, which Bush believes is crucial to the
survival of two nascent Western Hemisphere democracies.
   In Panama, the administration is anxious to repair the physical
damage from its invasion last December and the longer-term economic
damage from U.S. trade sanctions imposed as pressure on former
dictator Manuel Noriega.
   The situation is even more desperate in Nicaragua, which voted
the leftist government of Daniel Ortega out of office in February
and replaced him with a coalition led by President-elect Violeta
Chamorro.
   ``She's got the Contras (the U.S.-backed rebels) to dismantle, a
wrecked economy, she can't make agricultural plans,'' said a senior
administration official. Chamorro is to be sworn in April 25.
   ``Even before she raises her hand to take the oath of office
she's got more problems than the average president accumulates in a
year,'' the official said.
   Nicaraguan inauguration day, just nine days from now, has become
the administration's new target date for winning approval of the
aid package. Bush's earlier goal, April 5, slipped by without
congressional action.
   There is little controversy over the items Bush requested. The
House trimmed his $500 million for Panama to $420 million, devoting
the rest of the money to other foreign aid causes, but gave him the
full amounts for Nicaragua and the refugees.
   But the bill may be further delayed by unrelated disputes.
   Its must-pass nature makes the measure the ideal target for
those with sharp policy disputes with the White House, such as a
band of congressional liberals who want Bush to take a tougher line
toward the government of El Salvador and its alleged tolerance of
human rights abuses.
   Nobody ever said shopping on Capitol Hill was easy.

<HEAD>Musical Tribute Lincoln Never Heard Set for Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fate kept Abraham Lincoln from hearing the
march ``Honor to Our Soldiers,'' composed as a tribute to him, but
its strains will resound tonight at a concert marking the 125th
anniversary of his assassination.
   It was to have been played in Ford's Theater following the play
``Our American Cousin'' on April 14, 1865. But actor John Wilkes
Booth shot Lincoln during the third act, mortally wounding him.
   The rest of the program was canceled.
   Composer William Withers Jr. originally wrote the march for
piano. In tonight's performance sponsored by the National Park
Service, however, the 13-piece Federal City Silver Cornet Band will
play an arrangement scored for saxhorns _ large, deep-toned, brass
instruments.
   ``This may be the first time it has ever been performed,'' said
Mark Elrod of Gaithersburg, Md., founder of the ensemble.
   According to Lincoln assassination buff Richard Sloan of Long
Island, N.Y., however, the march was played at another theater
following the shooting. But he would not give details, saying he
wanted to use them himself in a magazine article.
   Sloan plans to be on hand for the concert of Civil War songs,
ending with ``Honor to Our Soldiers,'' after which the stage will
go dark.

   The prime minister resigned Monday and
King Birendra dissolved the national assembly he had dominated,
satisfying the two major conditions pro-democracy protesters had
set for joining an interim government.
   The announcement, broadcast by state radio, ended a week of
political deadlock in which the two parties leading the campaign
for democracy refused to join an interim government unless the
Rashtriya Panchayat, or national assembly, was dissolved and their
own nominee named prime minister.
   ``In view of the events that have taken place in certain parts
of the country, the people's aspirations and the ideals of
democracy, we have been making political changes,'' Birendra said.
   ``There should be a congenial atmosphere where every citizen can
enjoy democracy and nobody should be be forced to do anything which
can run counter to the expression of freedom.''
   The proclamation was the second major victory for pro-democracy
forces. On April 8, Birendra caved in to their demand to lift a
29-year-old ban on political parties. He also freed several hundred
political prisoners and permitted several previously banned
newspapers to reopen.
   The prime minister who resigned, Lokendra Bahadur Chand, had
been named to the post on April 6 in one of the king's last moves
to try to contain the pro-democracy movement.
   On that day, police unleashed the bloodiest crackdown in Nepal's
modern history. Witnesses said as many as 200 protesters were
killed, though the government put the death toll at 10.
   Birendra's proclamation followed the collapse earlier Monday of
marathon negotiations between Chand and leaders of the
pro-democracy movement, from which hundreds of protesters refused
to let the politicians leave.
   After learning of the breakdown, demonstrators destroyed a
Mercedes Benz belonging to the prime minister as well as the car of
Foreign Minister Pashupaiti Rana.
   By then, a crowd of about 15,000 had dwindled to a few hundred
angry students who refused to let negotiators leave. Police were
deployed on three sides of the government-run Royal Nepal Academy
of Arts and Literature, site of the talks. But officers said they
were under strict orders not to use force.
   Government officials and opposition leaders said they would
sleep in the academy, where the talks began Sunday.
   The king had invited the leaders of the pro-democracy movement,
the previously outlawed Nepali Congress Party and the United Left
Front, to join an interim government until the next general
elections.
   But they refused, saying they wanted their own nominee as prime
minister and the national assembly dissolved immediately.
   Frustrated protesters burst through the gates of the academy
three times during the Sunday's talks and demanded that the
government give in to the opposition demands. Demonstrators also
stoned and slightly damaged Chand's car as he attempted at one
point to leave the building. Chand scurried back to the meeting.
Minutes later, they also forced opposition leader Yog Prasad
Upadhyaya back to the talks.
   Demonstrators chanted slogans including ``Hang Chand'' and
``Chand resign now,'' clapped and danced on car rooftops during the
12-hour meeting. At least two people were slightly injured during
fighting between members of opposition factions, police said.
   Also Sunday, hundreds of Christians held an Easter march,
chanting ``We want religious freedom!'' as they tested the promises
of new democracy in this Himalayan nation. The march was the first
in recent memory in the world's only Hindu kingdom, which bans
Christian missionary work.
   On King's Way, the broad street leading to the tall walls
surrounding King Birendra's palace, 300 Nepalese Christians marched
shouting: ``We want religious freedom!''
   Nepalese law bans Hindus from converting to Christianity. Anyone
convicted of proselytizing is subject to prison terms ranging up to
six years.
   The authorities did not interfere in the Christian procession.
   Although King Birendra's government has described itself as a
democracy, the Nepalese Constitution gave the monarch supreme
executive, judicial and legislative powers.
   Ninety percent of Nepal's 17 million people are Hindus, while 5
percent are Moslems and 3 percent are Buddhists. Nepalese
Christians estimate their number at 25,000.

<HEAD>Yeutter Predicts Japan Will Allow Imports of US Rice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few developments would make American rice
farmers happier than to see Japan open its door to imports.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter predicts it will happen this
year.
   For decades, the United States has been badgering Japan to open
its import door to more agricultural products. There has been
significant success with beef, citrus and some other products.
   But rice, no way.
   Rice has almost mystical status as a food staple in Japan, and
government policies for many years were aimed at guaranteeing
self-sufficiency, regardless of high subsidy costs and rising
surpluses.
   Now, Japan is one of the most important trading nations engaged
in the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. The goal is to liberalize global trade by the
time the talks are scheduled to conclude at the end of this year.
   Yeutter, who is optimistic about a favorable conclusion to the
GATT talks, speaks with more certainty about Japan opening its rice
door.
   ``I believe that the Japanese market for rice will be opened up
prior to the end of the Uruguay Round, and should be open,''
Yeutter said.
   Allowing rice imports not only would be good for the Japanese
consumers but will help those countries that want to sell rice to
Japan, he said. And Tokyo cannot stand up for world trade
liberalization without looking at its own policies.
   ``Or, putting it in a more specific way,'' he said, ``Japan
simply cannot continue to exclude imports of rice from its own
marketplace while it insists in the Uruguay Round that other
nations liberalize trade in their industrial products and in
services such as the financial marketplace.''
   Yeutter's comments were made last week in a televised satellite
interview with European reporters, part of the U.S. Information
Agency's WorldNet operation.
   If Japan wishes to continue expanding its own exports, it must
open itself to others, he said.
   ``And my judgment is that the political leadership in Japan will
come to that same conclusion between now and December, and,
therefore, Japan will open its rice market,'' Yeutter said.
   ``There will be a great debate, of course, as to how far it will
open,'' he added. ``No one is suggesting that Japan must open its
rice market totally; that's unrealistic.''
   Meanwhile, these are uncertain times for U.S. rice producers.
It's not just the political maneuvering over the 1990 farm bill.
World supplies and prices are huge factors in the U.S. market.
   Rice is an important crop in half a dozen states, with Arkansas
the biggest producer, followed by California, Louisiana, Texas,
Mississippi and Missouri.
   Globally, most rice is consumed in the countries that produce
it. Total output in calendar 1990 is projected by USDA at 503.6
million metric tons. One ton is equal to about 22 hundredweight.
The hundredweight, or 100 pounds, is the standard U.S. measure.
   Of the world total output, China is expected to account for 179
million tons of rice and India, 105 million tons. Neither is a
major exporter in 1990.
   But Thailand, which is forecast to produce 21 million tons of
rice this year, will be the world's largest exporter at 4.7 million
tons.
   Japan's 1990 rice crop is forecast at 12.9 million tons. Exports
are zero, along with imports.
   The United States, which may produce around 7 million tons of
rice this year, according to USDA projections, is expected to
export about 2.6 million tons, second only to Thailand.
   According to the department's Foreign Agricultural Service,
China and Indonesia imported some rice in calendar 1989 but have
dropped out of the market this year. Now, the agency reported, the
major rice exporters are having to scramble harder in 1990.
   Meanwhile, in another report, analysts said U.S. rice stockpiles
could drop to 19 million hundredweight _ less than 1 million tons _
by Aug. 1, the beginning of the 1990-90 rice marketing year.
   That would be down from 26.7 million hundredweight last Aug. 1
and 31.4 million on Aug. 1, 1988. It also would be the lowest U.S.
rice stockpile at the beginning of a marketing year since 1981.
   Market prices paid to farmers have improved because of the
tighter supply and are currently expected to average $7.25 to $7.75
per hundredweight over the 1989-90 marketing year, up from $6.83 in
1988-89.

<HEAD>Study: Ibuprofen Can Cause Kidney Failure in Over-the-Counter
Doses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients suffering from kidney disease so
mild they don't know they have it run a serious risk of kidney
failure from the widely used pain reliever ibuprofen, a study warns.
   Ibuprofen is sold over the counter under such brand names as
Advil, Medipren, Motrin and Nuprin.
   The three-year study, appearing in Sunday's edition of the
Annals of Internal Medicine, was accompanied by an editorial that
proposed the Food and Drug Administration strengthen warning labels
to urge consumers ``with any serious condition'' to consult their
doctors before using the drug.
   Ibuprofen, approved for sale in non-prescription form since
1985, accounts for about 20 percent of the nation's $2.5 billion
annual over-the-counter sales of pain relievers.
   The study examined the short-term effects of ibuprofen on 12
women with mild kidney disease who also had arthritis and high
blood pressure, two illnesses that often prompt the use of
ibuprofen.
   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, led by Dr.
Andrew Whelton, gave participants 800 milligrams of ibuprofen three
times a day _ the equivalent of 12 ibuprofen tablets _ for up to 11
days.
   The maximum recommended non-prescription dose is 1,200
milligrams a day.
   After eight days, three women developed kidney failure, which
reversed when ibuprofen was discontinued. The three were then given
400 milligrams of ibuprofen three times a day, the maximum
recommended dose. Two of the three again developed kidney failure
but recovered when ibuprofen was stopped.
   The remaining nine women, who received ibuprofen for 11 days,
showed changes in kidney function but did not develop kidney
failure.
   Ibuprofen relieves pain by interfering with the body's
production of prostaglandin, a substance involved in inflammation.
But at the same time, the drug constricts blood flow.
   Normally, the change poses little risk if used for a short
period. But for those whose blood flow to the kidneys is already
reduced by kidney, heart or liver damage, the flu or aging,
ibuprofen could trigger acute kidney failure, the study says.
   Over-the-counter use of ibuprofen was of ``special concern''
because without careful monitoring people may not know their
kidneys are failing, the researchers said.
   ``Patients with previously undiagnosed mild renal impairment may
consume therapeutic doses of ibuprofen without supervision'' and
could suffer severe kidney damage, they wrote.
   The editorial's authors, pharmacologist Michael Murray of Purdue
University and Dr. D. Craig Brater of Indiana University, said the
study's results do not warrant the removal of ibuprofen from drug
store shelves.
   Instead, they agreed with the National Kidney Foundation that
warnings for the drug should be more explicit. Current labeling on
ibuprofen products warn only those people who are allergic to
aspirin not to take the medication.
   FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper said an agency advisory panel met in
February to consider ibuprofen warnings but had not yet made any
recommendations.
   Brater and Murray urged that further studies be conducted to
determine the risk to the general population of developing kidney
damage from ibuprofen.

<HEAD>Administration to Argue for Further Study on Global Warming</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush will ask a 17-nation conference
this week to examine the economic impact of global warming, but the
administration plans to argue it's too early to propose specific
measures to deal with the problem, officials say.
   The White House's cautious approach in developing responses to
global warming is expected to unleash renewed criticism from some
European countries that the United States is failing to provide
leadership in dealing with the so-called ``greenhouse'' effect.
   The Bush administration has maintained that while there is
widespread agreement that man-made pollutants are causing the earth
to become warmer, there remain too many unanswered questions to
warrant pollution controls that could have widespread economic
implications.
   The president is hosting a White House conference on the
greenhouse effect on Tuesday, just days before next Sunday's Earth
Day observance. During his 1988 campaign, Bush said such a
conference was a top priority and would be held in his first year
as president.
   Senior advisers on economics, science and the environment from
17 nations plan to attend, making it the first gathering on the
subject with government officials representing such a broad
spectrum of interest.
   Senior Bush advisers said they hoped the conference would for
the first time give equal weight to economic as well as
environmental issues related to global warming.
   ``We hope it will raise the level of debate ... on the science
and economics of global change,'' said Michael Boskin, chairman of
the president's Council of Economic Advisers, who will be one of
the three conference co-chairmen.
   Administration officials cautioned in briefings with reporters
that the gathering is not intended to produce any blueprint for
dealing with global warming. Instead, the officials said the
administration will emphasize the need for further scientific
studies and incorporating the economic issues involved.
   Last week, the president's chief science adviser, Allen Bromley,
criticized those who advocate ``slam-dunk solutions'' to global
warming. He said too many scientific and economic uncertainties
remain to map out specific measures.
   ``We cannot sail blindly into the future,'' he declared. Bromley
will serve as a conferenceco-chairman along with Boskin and Michael
Deland, chairman of the president's Council on Environmental
Quality.
   But even before many conference delegates arrived, officials
from several European countries complained about the Bush
administration's emphasis on further research and its refusal to
discuss specific action plans to deal with the greenhouse issue.
   ``Some delegates will advocate more than just research,'' said
an official from one European country, asking that he not be
identified further. ``We want to stress that research should not be
a substitute for action.''
   Some of the Europeans plan ``to push the Americans pretty
hard,'' said another European, also speaking anonymously.
   A number of European countries, including The Netherlands and
West Germany, have called for the industrial nations to commit
themselves to a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions by the
year 2000.
   Carbon dioxide, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels,
accounts for more than half the ``greenhouse'' pollutants. Such
curbs would require significant increases in energy efficiency or
cuts in energy use.
   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
said Sunday the president is committed to an international treaty
on global warming, but he too cautioned that more scientific
evidence is needed.
   ``We have to be cautious, careful and take out something of an
insurance policy,'' he said on ABC's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.''
   While most scientists agree that man-made pollutants are
enveloping the earth and causing it to warm, they are unsure about
the eventual severity of the warming.
   Some computer models have suggested a 4-degree to 9-degree
Fahrenheit increase in global temperatures, but some scientists
said those projections are uncertain and may not adequately take
into account the effects of clouds or other factors that might have
a counteracting effect.
   ``What we do not know is the timing, the magnitude or the rate
of the (temperature) increase,'' said Bromley.

   The Supreme Court's nine members are among the
most private of public officials. They wield enormous power, but

   It is not as if Byron R. White's resume needs
enhancement, but for two decades the capital city's rumor mill has
had him leaving the Supreme Court for some new challenge.
   Will he run for president or vice president? Has he been asked
to become FBI director? Will he become commissioner of major league
baseball or the National Football League?
   White has denied or ignored each of those rumors, and has
remained an independently minded, intellectual force on the court.
   Marking his 28th anniversary as a justice today, White, 72, is
considered an influential, consistent member of the court's
conservative majority.
   He has more seniority than anyone except Justice William J.
Brennan, 83, who joined the court in 1956.
   One rumor persists, seemingly finding its way into print every
year or so, that he is about to retire.
   After such a report was published in 1988, White dispatched
court spokeswoman Toni House to tell reporters, ``He has not told
friends any such thing. He is not considering retirement.''
   White, who refused to be interviewed for this article, continues
to scoff at any suggestion his retirement is imminent.
   His resume, by any standard, is impressive: athletic and
academic star in the tiny town of Wellington, Colo.; University of
Colorado valedictorian, class of '38; best-known college football
player of his time and star in basketball and baseball as well;
member of professional football's Hall of Fame; Rhodes scholar;
decorated war veteran; high-honors graduate of Yale law school; law
clerk to Chief Justice Fred Vinson; Attorney General Robert F.
Kennedy's chief aide; appointed to the Supreme Court by President
John F. Kennedy at age 44.
   It is an All-American story.
   In a breezy dispatch written just months after White joined the
court in 1962, an Associated Press reporter predicted, ``He is
going to be no flaming liberal, no social reformer type. Nor a
right-winger.''
   At the same time Life magazine said, ``Although he has had no
experience on the judicial bench, White is a man of depth and
intensity with a capacity for dispassionate analysis.''
   Some liberal critics say White, indeed, has become a
right-winger after spending most of his tenure at the court's
center.
   ``His voting record ... manifests a judicial philosophy that is
very close to Ronald Reagan's ideal,'' Washington lawyer Nathan
Lewin has said.
   White would let states outlaw most abortions, opposes broad use
of affirmative action to remedy past bias in employment, and favors
greater governmental accommodation of religion in ways some
consider violations of church-state separation.
   In cases pitting societal protection against individual rights,
White generally votes on the ``law and order'' side.
   He wrote for the court when in 1987 it ruled that the privacy
rights of homosexuals do not protect them from state laws making
sodomy a crime.
   ``I'm not a fan of his,'' said Stephen Barnett, a law professor
at the University of California-Berkeley. ``He has had no coherent
judicial philosophy and little distinction of any kind. His service
on the court is distinguished only by its length.''
   Barnett called White's opinion in the homosexual privacy case
``a low point in its sneering tone and lack of reasoning.''
   But Harvard law professor Lance Liebman, a former White clerk,
says that throughout his career the justice has tried to decide
most cases narrowly and without sweeping statements.
   ``He thus plays the role of the careful lawyer, applying his
powerful intelligence to the case before him, in the context of the
precedents as he finds them,'' Liebman said.
   White's written opinions, most often employing unadorned prose
rather than rhetorical flashes, reflect his personality. Friends
say that in his personal life, White exposes no more of his
thoughts and feelings than necessary.
   He can be gruff and impatient, as lawyers who appear before the
court have learned to their discomfort.
   Bad lawyering is almost as sure to make White grimace as being
reminded of the football nickname he has grown to hate _
``Whizzer.''
   Despite starring as the National Football League's best running
back for three years after signing in 1938 for a record-high
$15,800 annual salary, White says the sport was merely a means to
an end _ to earn the money needed for law school.
   Nevertheless, he played with a tenacity later displayed in his
legal career.
   ``That guy was tougher than hell. If we needed a yard or two, we
didn't call on our fullback, we called on him,'' former Detroit
Lions teammate Howard Weiss once told The Washington Post. ``I
should know, I was the fullback. He was a tough monkey.''

<HEAD>Chinese Impose Heavy Security on Democracy Movement Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of police, some in riot gear, took to
the streets of China's capital to prevent unrest on the anniversary
of the start of last spring's pro-democracy movement.
   They succeeded: a lone protester was arrested Sunday. Other
expressions of dissent were discouraged by the heavy police
presence.
   A year ago Sunday, former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang died.
   Hu was ousted from power in 1987 for failing to stop student
demonstrations and students mourning his death used the occassion
to criticize the leadership and push for democratic reform and an
end to official corruption.
   For seven weeks, Beijing streets were filled with crowds of up
to 1 million people demanding the resignation of unpopular leaders
and more say in how they live their lives.
   It all ended when troops invaded the city on June 3-4, killing
hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators with automatic weapons fire
and driving students from Tiananmen Square, the country's symbolic
seat of power.
   This spring, Beijing is a different city. Students say protests
are unlikely because of heavy police surveillance and the certainty
that anyone who tries to organize a demonstration will be arrested.
   In addition, thousands of people who took part in last year's
demonstrations are thought to still be in jail without charges, and
some protest leaders have fled the country.
   In anticipation of Sunday's anniversary, police set up
checkpoints at several intersections near the university area in
northwestern Beijing, and officers carrying rifles with bayonets
drawn patrolled the square.
   The square was open to the public Sunday, unlike on April 1 and
5 when police sealed it to block feared protests. Overseas
dissidents had urged people to silently stroll through the square
on those days in honor of those killed last June.
   Sunday's only incident occurred when a man in his 30s began to
pin on his sleeve white paper flowers, a traditional sign of
mourning. Streamers from the flowers read ``To mourn Hu Yaobang''
and ``Heroes who die for democracy and liberty.''
   Police quickly arrested the man, who told onlookers he was a
scientist from the southern province of Guizhou and had come to
Beijing ``to mourn our great general secretary (Hu).''
   He carried suitcases and said he had come to Beijing with
everything he owned in anticipation of being arrested.
   About 20 police stood guard around a Monument to Revolutionary
Heroes in the middle of the square throughout the day, forbidding
entry.
   The monument, usually open, was covered with wreaths last year
brought by students and others to mourn Hu. It was also the
headquarters for student leaders during their occupation of the
100-acre square last May and June.
   Buses and vans loaded with police were parked around the
monument, and dozens of uniformed and plainclothes police patrolled
the square.
   As usual, almost all the people on the square were from outside
Beijing: workers in blue Mao jackets and rubber-soled slippers,
sunburned farmers in ill-fitting suits and honeymooners posing for
pictures.
   Students and young workers have been warned by authorities to
stay away from Tiananmen this spring and told they face expulsion
or banishment to a countryside job if they are involved in protests.
   Hundreds of riot police, some with shields and hard helmets,
were stationed along main streets of the capital on Sunday,
ostensibly to control crowds for a marathon race through the city.
   Surprisingly, security was only marginally increased at the
university campuses in northwestern Beijing that were hotbeds of
dissent last spring.
   At Beijing Normal University, crowds gathered around recently
posted notices announcing the expulsions of movement leaders Wu'er
Kaixi and Chai Ling, both of whom escaped to the West.
   Students appeared more concerned with making the most of
Sunday's sunshine and warm temperatures _ reading outdoors or
playing basketball _ than with attempting to mark the anniversary.
   The Communist Party's official People's Daily did not mention
the anniversary in its Sunday edition. There have been no reported
official events to commemorate the death of Hu.

<HEAD>Washington Post Racing Columnist Shares Bounty at Horse Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Post's racing columnist has won
a share in the second-largest jackpot in Maryland horse racing
history, a double-triple pool of more than $1.3 million.
   Andrew Beyer and nine other bettors grossed $134,161.80 apiece
Saturday at Baltimore's Pimlico racetrack from a pool that had been
steadily growing for 23 days. The other winners were not identified.
   Beyer gambled $4,578 after determining that ``at least half the
horses in the field were so totally devoid of talent that they
couldn't possibly finish in the money'' and then plotting out
possible strategies for the remaining contenders, he said in his
column Sunday.
   The ten winners had to pick the correct order of finish for
first, second and third in both the third and fifth races.
   ``I never even had to root,'' Beyer wrote. ``My horses
controlled the race from start to finish.''
   The state record for double-triple payoffs is $314,366, which
went to a syndicate of local professionals in February 1987.
   ``I have spent many, many years and a ridiculous amount of
effort trying to win a six-digit payoff at a racetrack, and I had
finally done it,'' Beyer said in his column.
   ``I'll save seven digits for a future goal.''

<TEXT>
   Retired judge Arlin Adams, a longtime
stalwart of the federal bench, is taking on what may be his
toughest case _ the HUD scandal.
   His staff isn't complete and remains in temporary offices, but
Adams said it has been making progress anyway in its investigation
of alleged fraud by top officials in the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
   Adams, who travels back and forth to Washington as needed, said
his staff has received FBI files and other documents and met with
two congressional committees.
   He expects to have his staff completed by this week, and
interviews in the investigation should start ``almost any day,'' he
said Thursday.
   Adams, 68, spent 18 years on the bench of the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. He retired and went back to his
old law firm three years ago. He also is finishing two books, due
out this year, on religion and law.
   Never quite out of the legal limelight, Adams last month was
named independent counsel to investigate allegations that former
Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. and other HUD officials
conspired to defraud a government program by steering rent
subsidies to politically connected developers.
   There has been testimony before congressional committees that
hundreds of millions of dollars were improperly handled, possibly
stolen.
   The soft-spoken Adams has a reputation for being sensitive but
firm with those who stand before him.
   If the evidence is there for him to seek indictments, Adams
said, he will hire other lawyers to do the courtroom work. His
expertise at the trial level is in civil work, mainly in antitrust,
securities and mergers.
   Yet he said his most interesting case was a murder. Early in his
career, he was appointed to defend a man charged with killing a
policeman. He won reversal of the conviction when he was able to
prove his client hadn't fired the bullet.
   As a judge, Adams heard the appeal of two Soviet spies convicted
of obtaining secrets of the Strategic Air Command. Adams said he
persuaded his colleagues on the court that the president, as head
of foreign affairs, did not need court authorization to order the
wiretaps used to convict the spies.
   ``The interesting windup of the case is that the Russians
demanded the United States return the two spies in exchange for
Gary Powers, who was shot down by the Russians during the
Eisenhower Administration in the U-2 incident. I think that was a
good result,'' Adams said.
   Adams, a lifelong Republican, staunchly believes all lawyers
should be involved in public service _ even when it costs them
money.
   ``If the lawyers won't do it, who will?'' he said.
   ``For reasons I don't quite understand, lawyers today are not
taking on as much public work as they did 10 or 20 years ago. Like
so much in society the legal profession has gotten very
materialistic. But I am hopeful that is going to change.''
   His first taste of politics came in 1949 when the head of his
law firm, William Schnader, was chairman of a commission writing a
new charter for the city of Philadelphia and got Adams involved.
   Then Adams worked in several campaigns of Rep. Hugh Scott, who
later became a U.S. senator and minority leader. When another
congressman, William Scranton, ran for governor, Adams became a key
supporter.
   ``When he won he urged me to become a member of his cabinet and
first I said, `No, I couldn't afford it,' but when he asked me to
be secretary of public welfare, Mr. Schnader and I decided that was
a request I couldn't turn down because that was public service,''
Adams said.
   Later, Scranton and Scott unsuccessfully urged Adams to run for
governor.
   In 1968, Adams became one of the key people in Richard Nixon's
successful presidential bid. That led to his appeals court
appointment.
   Adams said high points in his career came when Nixon and
President Ford considered him for the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``I don't think I was entitled to it,'' Adams said. ``There were
many other lawyers and judges more qualified, I thought, and just
being considered was honor enough.''
   ``President Jimmy Carter, while I was a judge, offered me a very
high government position which I cannot discuss because I declined
to accept it,'' Adams added. ``I thought that was a very satisfying
thing because he did that strictly on my record. I did not know
Jimmy Carter.''

<HEAD>Project Aimed at Reducing Frailty Among Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will sponsor a three-year, $2.9
million research project aimed at reducing or preventing the
elderly from becoming physically frail, two federal agencies say.
   The National Institute on Aging and the National Center for
Nursing Research said sites in eight states will be used for the
``FICSIT'' project _ which stands for Frailty and Injuries:
Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques.
   More than 1,500 volunteers are expected to participate. The
program will feature exercise, ranging from the Oriental practice
of tai chi to aerobic dance; education, to make older people aware
of accident risks; and rehabilitation, to improve physical
conditioning.
   Millions of older people lack strength, mobility, balance and
endurance, and are therefore susceptible to serious falls, nursing
home admissions and a loss of independence, according to the NIA.
   ``The new trials highlight the fact that frailty and injuries
are not the inevitable outcome of aging,'' said NIA Director Dr. T.
Franklin Williams. ``Instead they are problems for which we have
now found some very viable solutions.''
   More than 32 percent of people over age 75 cannot climb stairs,
40 percent are unable to walk two blocks, 7 percent cannot walk
across a small room and 22 percent cannot lift 10 pounds, the NIA
said. Forty-two percent of nursing home residents cannot get out of
a chair without help.

<HEAD>Senator Leaders Say U.S.-Soviet Trade Improvements Could Be</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Threatened
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hoped-for trade agreement between the United
States and Moscow could be derailed if Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev carries out his threatened economic blockade against
Lithuania, warn Senate leaders in both parties.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Sunday that retaliation by Moscow to
Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence would jeopardize a
trade agreement President Bush and Gorbachev hoped to sign at a
summit in June.
   The Bush administration was taking what Secretary of State James
A. Baker III called a ``wait and see'' attitude as the
Kremlin-imposed deadline for Lithuania to rescind its declaration
of independence passed Sunday night.
   Mitchell, who on Saturday condemned Gorbachev's ultimatum as
``precisely the wrong approach,'' said Sunday he was waiting for
Bush to do the same. But in an interview on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation,'' Mitchell also supported the administration's reluctance
to issue specific counter threats.
   ``We ought not to be announcing in advance what we're going to
do when we don't know for sure that they are going to do,'' he said.
   However, Mitchell said ``a wide range'' of possible reactions
could include canceling the summit, slowing down the trade
negotiations and ``in between those ... a whole lot of things that
can be done.''
   Dole, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' from Jerusalem,
questioned the wisdom of canceling the summit if the Soviets carry
out their threat to cut off supplies to Lithuania.
   Any U.S. retaliation, Dole said, should be limited to measures
that are more to Moscow's benefit than to the United States.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Dialogue To End Lithuanian Crisis, Salutes Quest For
Freedom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his Easter message, Pope John Paul II
paid tribute to the thirst for freedom that toppled dictatorships
last year and said he hoped Lithuania can achieve independence
through dialogue.
   Celebrating the holiday elsewhere, East Germans and Romanians
sang hymns of joy for the freedom won by their pro-democracy
revolutions.
   In the Soviet Ukraine, Roman Catholics in Kiev were allowed to
legally perform Easter services on Sunday for the first time in 44
years.
   In Sunday's message, the pope declared that man's ``true
dimensions of the spirit have been discovered anew'' after two
bloody world wars and ``years of dictatorships which have deprived
men and women of their basic freedoms.''
   After the noontime message from a balcony overlooking St.
Peter's Square, the Roman Catholic leader spoke in Lithuanian,
saying, ``In the name of Jesus dead and risen for all men, we ask
for peace for our children in the dear Lithuania nation, while we
hope that their aspirations find confirmation in a respectful and
comprehensive dialogue.''
   Cheers went up from a crowd of 100,000 faithful and tourists in
the square, where the pope earlier celebrated Easter Mass in front
of St. Peter's Basilica. His message on Lithuania was the latest
attempt by the Vatican to help ease tensions between Moscow and the
tiny Baltic republic, which declared itself independent on March 11.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported that a Soviet
envoy received by the pope on Saturday had delivered a message from
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev about the crisis in Lithuania, where
four out of five people are Catholic. The contents of the message
were not disclosed.
   The Vatican in March opened diplomatic relations with Moscow.
Earlier this month, the Vatican's newly appointed envoy to the
Soviet Union said the Holy See would be willing to mediate the
Lithuanian dispute.
   In his speech, John Paul gave holiday wishes in 55 languages.
The longest greetings went to Lithuania and his homeland, Poland.
   In Romania on Sunday, tens of thousands of worshipers sang
ancient hymns in packed churches across the nation in an emotional
celebration of their freest Easter in more than four decades.
   In Timisoara, where Romania's December revolution began and
where some of the worst fighting occurred, Archbishop Nicolae
eulogized the martyrs of the revolution in a sermon to 2,000 people.
   ``After 45 years during which (Communists) tried to enslave our
soul and history ... we now celebrate in freedom Holy Easter,'' he
said.
   Similar services were held in the two Germanys.
   East and West Germans poured through their border in both
directions and packed churches. Last month, East Germany's citizens
held their first free elections ever and elected a goverment that
favors speedy reunification.
   Thousands of Germans took to the streets for traditional Easter
peace marches. For the first time ever, peace activists from both
West and East Germany joined together for the anti-war rallies and
demonstrations.
   Nearly 3,000 leftist demonstrators carrying East German, Soviet
and Palestinian flags took part in a noisy march from East Berlin
to West Berlin.
   ``Berlin without a Wall _ Germany without weapons _ Europe
without blocs,'' read the lead banner.
   ``We want an East Germany and a West Germany completely without
the military,'' a demonstration leader yelled through a microphone
to the cheers of the crowd.
   In Lebanon, church bells vied with bursts of gunfire from
warring Christian groups in east Beirut as thousands of Christians
wondered whether full-scale fighting would break out again in the
battle for control of their enclave.
   ``The roar of the guns today is sharpening fears of renewed
warfare,'' said Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir of the Maronite Catholic
community, the largest Christian sect in Lebanon, in an Easter
sermon at the chapel of his seat in Bkirki, north of Beirut.
   He warned that a new round of full-scale fighting would finish
off the Christians, saying that more than one half have already
fled Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   In Israel, the Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem used his
Easter message to call for equality between peoples.
   In a sermon before hundreds of pilgrims and tourists at the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the traditional site of
Christ's crucifixion and burial, Patriarch Michel Sabbah said:
   ``Individuals and peoples are equal in all rights. A people must
not oppress another people, nor must a people be dominated by
another people.''
   As Ukrainian Catholics held Easter services in Kiev, a
controversial cathedral in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov that
was given back last week to Ukrainian Catholics was closed for
Easter to avoid conflict.
   An announcement by the Ukrainian nationalist movement Rukh said
St. George's Cathedral, which had been under Russian Orthodox
control, was closed ``to prevent provocations and ease tension
during the holiday.''
   The Ukrainian Catholic faith, outlawed in 1946 as Stalin moved
to quash expressions of nationalism, has been practiced openly
under Gorbachev's reforms.

<TEXT>
   Chinatown merchants desperate for speedy
repair of an earthquake-damaged freeway that once led tourists
their way organized a shutdown of the district today to protest a
plan to build a new highway.
   Mayor Art Agnos doesn't want the elevated Embarcadero Freeway
rebuilt. He wants it replaced with a highway at street level or
underground.
   But neighborhood activists say a new highway would be more
expensive and take longer than repairing the 1.7-mile road damaged
in the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   Hundreds of merchants in Chinatown were to close their doors
today and head for an afternoon meeting of the Board of
Supervisors, which has the mayor's proposal on its agenda.
   Agnos argues the elevated freeway is ugly, blocks a panoramic
view of San Francisco Bay and is too expensive to repair, although
state Transportation Department estimates put the cost of reopening
the road at $32 million.
   Agnos wants to spend $120 million to replace it, acknowledging
that the project could take five or six years. The Transportation
Department said repairs could be completed by Oct. 1 if the work
started in June.
   Rose Pak of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and others said time
is critical for Chinatown merchants who have been doing without
their key link to tourists who usually keep their shops and
restaurants bustling.
   She called today's shutdown a ``very basic, grassroots, humble
gesture.'' It follows the submission of 10,000 signatures in favor
of repairing the freeway.
   ``It's a political statement that we're not a silent minority,''
Pak said.
   The freeway has long been controversial. In 1986, voters
rejected a proposal to spend $10 million to tear it down. Many
groups opposed it even before it opened in 1959, saying it would
sacrifice city streets and alter the character of neighborhoods.
   Supervisor Tom Hsieh was outraged by the mayor's proposal, which
he said was explained to the board of supervisors in a two-page
statement that lacked details about where the $120 million would
come from and what Chinatown is supposed to do while the expressway
is built.
   ``Some leaders have no idea of the hardship and the trauma
people in that community are facing,'' Hsieh said. ``They lost not
just business, they lost employment.''
   Last week, a San Francisco Chamber of Commerce business panel
voted in favor of rebuilding the road.
   Although business leaders vow that Agnos' position will hurt him
politically, the mayor contends that the long-term interests of the
city must come first.
   ``Nobody wants to sacrifice short-term discomfort for long-term
progress, but that's what a great city has to do, or it will become
stagnant,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fuel Tanks of Religious Group's Fallout Shelter Leak Near
Yellowstone</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY9</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORWIN SPRINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 19,000 gallons of fuel are
believed to have leaked near Yellowstone National Park from a
fallout shelter built by a religious group girding for nuclear
Armageddon.
   Workers on Sunday began pumping out 540,000 gallons of gasoline
and diesel from the underground tanks, while furious local
residents said their fears of an environmental disaster were borne
out by the leaks.
   ``I'd say we're mad as hell,'' said Richard Parks, who owns an
outdoor equipment shop in nearby Gardiner. ``I hope they can get
(the fuel) out of there. I hope to God people have got the sense
not to let them put it back in.''
   The 35 tanks, with a capacity of 634,500 gallons, were installed
last winter in the Church Universal and Triumphant's underground
complex. The shelters are on a ranch purchased in 1981 from
publisher Malcolm Forbes to prepare for a nuclear catastrophe.
   Church officials reported last week that one tank containing
diesel fuel had leaked 4,000 gallons into the ground. Two others
were reported leaking over the weekend.
   Steve Pilcher, chief of Montana's Water Quality Bureau, said
15,000 gallons were unaccounted for Sunday and most likely were in
the soil near the complex.
   The tanks and the 750-person shelter complex are five miles
north of Yellowstone National Park and within several hundred yards
of Mol Heron Creek, a cutthroat trout spawning stream that runs
into the Yellowstone River.
   Small amounts of fuel had reached the creek, but no major damage
had occurred, officials said. Pilcher said less than 1,000 gallons
of spilled fuel had been recovered, but trenches were dug to
capture most of the fuel before it reached the creek.
   ``It's not a one-day, quick-fix cleanup. ... They're looking at
a long-term recovery and cleanup effort. There's still a big threat
there,'' Pilcher said. By Saturday night, church officials had
decided all 35 tanks must be pumped out, excavated and inspected,
said Murray Steinman, a sect spokesman.
   ``After the second and third leaks, we said, `That's it, we're
going to get all this out of here,''' Steinman said. The cleanup is
under the direction of Envirocon, a Missoula-based engineering firm
retained by the church.
   Steinman said tanker trucks hauled out 110,000 gallons of
gasoline on Sunday, and crews will work all week to remove the
remaining fuel.
   The leaks occurred within weeks after state officials reopened
their environmental review of church developments near Corwin
Springs. They said the church concealed construction of the complex
during the original review, completed a year ago.
   The local population of church members mushroomed this year
after spiritual leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet, who claims she
receives and passes on to church members messages from a group of
souls known as the Ascended Masters, warned that March and April
are dangerous times.
   She told members to come to Montana for a prayer vigil and to
prepare for a possible nuclear war or accident.
   Local officials estimate 2,000 to 3,000 church members live in
the scenic mountain valley, where the church owns about 30,000
acres and has sponsored housing developments. The church said
nobody is living in the fallout shelters.
   Steinman said the tanks might have been defective. But Pilcher
said the tanks might have ruptured because they were installed in

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Down, Dollar Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange tumbled in
thin trading Monday, while the dollar ended higher against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average, the market's main barometer, fell
750.74 points, or 2.57 percent, to 28,463.18. A thin 230 million
issues changed hands on the exchange's first section, which
includes the country's largest and most profitable firms.
   The dollar closed at 159.42 yen, up one yen from its close
Friday at 158.42. The currency moved in a narrow range between
159.00 yen and 159.45 yen after opening at 159.15 yen.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
government bond was quoted at 85.79 points at 3:00 p.m., down from
its close Friday at 85.90. The bond yield rose to 7.405 percent
from 7.380 percent.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, an analyst for New Japan Securities Co., said
arbitrage selling of spot issues accounted for the deep losses in
the Nikkei index, which were further exaggerated by the unusually
light trading.
   In arbitrage trading, dealers exchange spot issues for stock
futures, or vice versa, in an attempt to profit from the difference
in prices between the two markets.
   Japanese market participants have frequently pointed to the
recent introduction of arbitrage techniques as a reason for the
continuing instability of the Tokyo market.
   Nomura said market dealers were largely waiting on the sidelines
ahead of an announcement Wednesday by the U.S. Commerce Department
of the country's trade figures for February. They were also waiting
to see the Bank of Japan's moves to regulate the country's money
supply and the trend in exchange rates.
   On the currency market, dealers also pointed to the U.S. trade
figure announcement and speculation about future Bank of Japan
policy regarding interest rates as affecting the yen-dollar rate.
   Norio Takeda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said the dollar's
early strength was attributable to the view that the upcoming U.S.
monthly trade imbalance will show an improvement.
   A dealer with Fuji Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity,
added the dollar was also propped up by a large demand for the
currency by banks on occasion of the first day of the monthly
reserve-accounting period Monday.
   Early in the reserve period, banks try to obtain a lot of cash
to fufill their reserve requirements. The surge in demand often
kicks up demand for the dollar as well as various short term
interest rates.

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts from the Vatican
translation of Pope John Paul II's Easter Sunday message, which was
delivered in Italian.
   
   I have overcome the world! (Jn 16:33).
   The stone before the tomb at the foot of Golgotha' rolled away.
The tomb itself empty... He is not here. He has risen, he is not
here. (Mk 16:6).
   Go, tell his disciples and Peter... (Mk 16:7).
   Simon, Peter and John discover in the tomb everything just as
the women had said. They do not find him. Were they perhaps,
already then, capable of recalling those words: I have overcome the
world? In the world you have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I
have overcome the world. (Jn 16:33). Yes. Those last days had been
a time of terrible tribulation. They had been dismayed by the
arrest in Gethsemane, by the condemnation to the cross, by the
death on Calvary. They had experienced a terrible tribulation.
Before the empty tomb did they wonder: Has he conquered the world?
...
   This world in which man lives, where man has dominion, this
world in the end seems to overcome man. It overcomes him through
death. But Christ, who has conquered death, has overcome the
world... By his own death he has put to death that death whose
beginning was sin. Man's sin and the sin of the world.
   The world, as the original lie was whispered, became in man's
heart God's foe. The world, which should have opened man's heart to
God, began instead to drive God out of the human heart. And even
though the tempter has repeated from the beginning: You will be
like God (cf. Gen 3:5), this world is never able to offer man, in
the end, anything more, anything other than death....
   In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer. That
world which is the theatre of man's history...carries the marks of
his energies, his tragedies and his triumphs. (Gaudium et Spes, 2).
The world...the scene of man's many tribulations has fallen into
the bondage of sin (ibid) and so often calls this very bondage its
freedom! The world, called into existence out of love and kept in
existence by its creator, by Christ on the cross, freed by the
power of his death and revealed anew, through his resurrection, as
the divine Cosmos (cf. ibid.).
   Man of our time! Man living immersed in the world, thinking that
you have mastered it, whereas you may well be its victim, Christ
frees you from every form of bondage to set you upon the way to
victory over self, to love that is constructive and aims for the
good, a love that is demanding, that makes you build up and not
destroy your tomorrow, your family, your environment, and all of
society.
   Man of our time! Only the Risen Christ can fully satisfy your
irrepressible yearning for freedom! After the horrors of two World
Wars and all the wars which in these last fifty years, often in the
name of godless ideologies, have reaped a harvest of victims and
sown hatred in so many nations, after the years of dictatorships
which have deprived men and women of their basic freedoms, the true
dimensions of the spirit have been discovered anew, those
dimensions which the Church has always promoted by revealing, in
Christ, man's true stature.
   Today as well the reawakening of many democracies is leading to
dialogue and trust between peoples; and the world is coming to
understand once again that man cannot live without God, without the
truth that, in him, makes him free (cf. Jn 8:32)
   Man of our time! Christ sets you free from selfishness to call
you to a spirit of sharing and to a ready and joyful commitment to
others. I have been in Africa, in the Sahel, and I have seen the
sand burying villages, drying up wells, burning the eyes, turning
children into skeletons, paralyzing the strength of the young, as
it brings desperation, starvation, sickness and death. Death from
hunger and thirst. Man of today! Wealthy nations of the
civilisation of opulence! Do not be indifferent to this great
tragedy, be ever more urgently resolved to help those peoples who
struggle each day for survival. Let yourselves be convinced that
there can be no freedom, where misery continues to exist.
   Let human and Christian solidarity be the challenge that
provokes your conscience to make that sand slowly give way to the
advancement of human dignity, an abundance of bread, and the return
of laughter, employment, hope and progress. Yet I thank God that I
have also seen volunteers, individuals, associations and
institutions, priests, religious, laity of various professions
committing themselves and making sacrifices for the good of their
brothers and sisters, who are most lonely and most sorely tried. I
thank them in the name of the Crucified and Risen Lord!
   Man of our time! Christ frees you because he loves you, because
he has given himself for you (cf. Gal 2:20), because he has won
victory for you and for all people....

   Miss Norway Mona Grudt has been crowned Miss
Universe 1990 and wins an audition for a major Hollywood movie.
   The auburn-haired 19-year-old, affectionately nicknamed the
``beauty queen from Hell'' after the name of her hometown, took the
top spot over 70 other contestants in the pageant Sunday night at
the Shubert Theater in Century City.
   Miss USA was first runner-up and Miss Colombia second runner-up.
   Miss Grudt said she wants to work as a pediatric nurse and
``help the poor children in Africa.''
   ``Now I can be ambassadoress, not just for Norway, but for the
whole world,'' she said. ``I will try to make girls believe this is
more than a beauty contest, and that you have to be something more
than empty inside to win this.''
   She said that when she called her parents in Norway with the
news, ``My mother was screaming. You couldn't make sense of what
she said.''
   The global glamour parade featured a first-ever entry from the
Soviet Union and a prize package to the winner worth $220,000. It
includes an audition for a major studio film and a $40,000 personal
appearance contract.
   The green-eyed, 5-foot-6 winner turned 19 on April 6 while
preparing for the pageant. She said she is a fan of Bruce
Springsteen and actress Meryl Streep.
   Carole Gist, a 20-year-old student from Detroit, represented the
United States and was the first black American to compete in the
Miss Universe pageant. She took her runner-up status with grace.
   ``I still get to be Miss USA for the year, and I hope to make it
the best year possible,'' Miss Gist said.
   The second runner-up, 18-year-old Liseth Mahecha of Colombia,
said through a translator, ``I'm very happy with the result _
especially because I put Colombia's name in a prominent place.''
   The 39th Miss Universe pageant was televised live in the United
States by CBS. An estimated 500 million viewers worldwide were
expected to have tuned in.
   The contestants, wearing traditional garb of their homelands,
opened the pageant by parading in front of a replica of the
``Hollywood'' sign in a production number done to the strains of
``Dancing in the Streets.''
   Other first-place prizes included $66,000 in cash, a luxury Los
Angeles apartment for the year-long reign, a convertible, a mink
coat and jacket, a gold and diamond watch, and a selection of
evening gowns.
   The winner also gets a 100-inch TV set, a portable video
package, cosmetics, clothing and a camera.

   Rain dampened the northern Plains early today, hours after a
tornado touched down in Texas.
   While much of the nation enjoyed fair weather, showers fell
early today in Montana and North Dakota, and thunderstorms
continued to sweep through western, central and northern Texas.
Flash floods were reported in Dallas and Kaufman counties.
   On Sunday, a tornado touched down in west Texas near Sweetwater.
No one was injured, but several homes and businesses were damaged.

Tennessee, Kentucky and east-central Florida. Showers and
thunderstorms were scattered over Colorado, Utah and Oregon.
   Rain dampened northwestern New York state and eastern New

<HEAD>Stocks Fall In Tokyo, Dollar Surges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped sharply
in thin trading today, as the dollar surged against the Japanese
yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, the Tokyo exchange's main
index, fell 750.74 points, or 2.57 percent, to 28,463.18. Only 230
million shares changed hands on the exchange's first section, down
from 320 million shares on Friday.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst for Nomura Securities, said a
sprinkling of sell orders during the day over thin trading forced
down the Nikkei index.
   He said many participants stayed on the sidelines awaiting the
release of U.S. economic indicators, including the consumer price
index due out on Tuesday and February trade statistics on Wednesday.
   As a result, he said, ``No one wants to do any buying.''
   Traders said the weakening yen also discouraged market
participants.
   Dealers and news reports earlier in the day said the Nikkei's
fall was related to arbitrage selling of spot issues, but Umemori
said arbitrage had only a slight impact on the market.
   In arbitrage trading, which has been frequently blamed for
recent drops in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders attempt to profit
from price differences between the spot and futures markets.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 159.42 yen, up 1.00
yen from Friday's close of 158.42 yen. The U.S. currency stayed in
a narrow range between 159.00 yen and 159.45 yen after opening at
159.15 yen.
   An analyst with New Japan Securities, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said many currency traders also were awaiting U.S. trade
statistics.
   ``There is particularly strong sentiment on the market that the
trade results will be good, so dealers are trying to attain long
(or strong) positions'' in the dollar, the dealer added.
   A trade report saying the United States had further decreased
its trade deficit is likely to strengthen the dollar on currency
markets.
   In the bond market, benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds
closed at 85.74 points, down from 85.90 at Friday's close. Their
yield rose to 7.415 percent from 7.380 percent.

   A man who flew into a rage at a surgeon after
learning his father had died on the operating table returned with a
gun and opened fire in an emergency room, killing two people and
wounding two, police and witnesses say.
   Bradford Warren Powers Jr., 46, was being held today for
investigation of murder and attempted murder in the rampage
Saturday at Mission Bay Memorial Hospital.
   He surrendered to police shortly after the shooting spree, in
which a nurse and a medical trainee were killed and a doctor and a
patient's father were wounded.
   The elder Powers had suffered an abdominal aneurysm and required
emergency surgery, but his son had told doctors not to operate,
saying the 75-year-old wouldn't survive the surgery because of his
age and condition, said Dr. Harry Henderson, hospital chief of
staff-elect.
   But Henderson said the man would have died without the
operation. He said the surgery was successful but the elder Powers,
who suffered from heart and lung ailments, died on the operating
table of cardiac arrest.
   People who were in the emergency room when Powers was told by a
surgeon that his father had died said the son became enraged.
   ``The surgeon came out to talk to him and he got irate. He was
stomping around,'' said P.J. Ginsburg, who was being treated for
burns. ``He started to yell, `What the hell's wrong with you, why
didn't you treat him the first time?'''
   The elder Powers had been taken to the emergency room the night
before for an unrelated ailment and released, Henderson said.
   Powers apparently left the hospital, then returned and opened
fire with a handgun, police said.
   Deborah Burke, a nurse at the hospital for about 10 years, died
after being shot once in the chest, authorities said.
   Edward Thomas Rooney, 30, who was studying to become an
emergency medical technician and was in the emergency room as an
observer, died of multiple gunshot wounds, officials said.
   Dr. Michael Hughes, an emergency room physician, suffered minor
wounds to his abdomen and hip and was reported in good condition at
Scripps Memorial Hospital, officials said.
   Frederick Mowrer, 38, was treated for a superficial gunshot
wound to the buttocks. Mowrer, a lawyer from Albuquerque, N.M., and
his wife had taken their 2-year-old daughter to the emergency room
with flu symptoms.
   Mowrer said he tried to help the wounded before he realized the
gunman was aiming at him.
   ``He didn't look like a crazy man,'' said Mowrer, who was
wounded when he tried to run.
   ``I was looking at him and I saw the gun coming up. I turned to
avoid him. I guess I thought I was giving him a smaller target. I
didn't even know I was shot. I fell to the ground.''

<HEAD>Fifth Cabbie Killed in Bronx</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said the fifth slaying in five weeks of a
cabbie in the Bronx is not the work of a serial killer suspected in
three of the shootings, but that did little to calm drivers' fears.
   ``I want to stop driving this month,'' said Aleou Gueyes, a
driver for four years who manages Uptown Car Service in the Bronx.
``I can drive a truck.''
   The latest victim, Rafael Montes De Oca, 38, was found slain
Saturday night, the fifth time since March 7 that a cab driver had
been fatally shot in the head at close range in the Bronx. All five
had been robbed of cash.
   Police have said one man using a .22-caliber handgun was
responsible for the first three shootings. That person phoned three
Bronx car services and requested cabs, then shot and robbed the
drivers.
   In the fourth shooting, last Tuesday, a driver who picked up a
fare on the street was shot and died the next day. Witnesses saw
two teen-agers flee that car. Police said that case was unrelated
to the first three.
   Police also said the killing of Montes De Orca appeared
unrelated to the first three.
   ``There are certain consistencies in the other cases which are
not present in this one,'' said Lt. James Malvey, precinct
commander. ``We became convinced there is no connection.''
   Mayor David Dinkins offered a $10,000 reward on Thursday for
information leading to the killers.
   The Guardian Angels announced that a member of the group would
begin riding with drivers for two car services on their overnight
runs Sunday night.
   ``We look upon these car services as the lifeline in these
communities,'' said Lisa Sliwa, a leader of the crime-fighting
group known for its red berets. ``Without them, there's no way for
people like nurses who work late to get around.''
   Cabbies said they are being choosier about their passengers, and
companies are having trouble keeping drivers as they quit or refuse
to work nights.
   Ten to 15 percent of Seaman Car Services' 350 drivers no longer
work late hours, said Luz Rivera, a dispatcher at the company where
the latest victim worked.
   Gueyes said he sizes up his fares and refuses to take more than
one person for fear of being outnumbered. ``Sometimes when I see
the people, if they don't look right, I keep on going,'' he said.
   ``I try not to think about it, but it's always on your mind,''
said Miguel Reyes of Amigo Car Service, a cab driver for 11 years.
   On Saturday, a customer who gave his name as ``George'' called
Seaman Car Services and asked for Car 215, Montes De Oca's car,
Rivera said. ``I told Rafael and he said, `Tell him I'll be there
in 10 minutes.'''
   More than an hour later, a caller reported the driver appeared
either unconscious or dead, Seaman president Rafael Peralta said.
   Montes De Oca had a pregnant wife and four children, police said.

<HEAD>NASA Installs New Power Unit, Begins Charging Space Telescope
Batteries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA says it has completed the
trickiest part of preparations for the second attempt to launch
space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope.
   The space agency on Saturday removed a faulty auxiliary power
unit that forced a scrub of Discovery's launch last Tuesday. A new
unit was installed Sunday, the first time the procedure has been
performed at the launch pad.
   Also on Saturday, Discovery's payload bay doors were opened and
Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries were removed for recharging
at a laboratory. The 130-hour recharging began around noon Sunday.
   NASA took the batteries to the lab because they can be recharged
at a cooler temperature there than at the launch pad, and thus
retain more power.
   NASA spokesman George Diller said the weekend operations were
the trickiest part of preparation for the second launch attempt.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off with the $1.5 billion
telescope, the space agency's most expensive payload, on April 25.
   ``Right now everything seems to be in the bag for a week from
Wednesday,'' Diller said.
   The shuttle's three auxiliary power units, which weigh 88 pounds
each, pressurize the hydraulic system used for braking and
steering. All power units must be operating properly for a safe
launch.
   Once in orbit, the telescope will enable astronomers to study
stars and galaxies so distant that their light has been traveling
toward Earth for 14 billion years.

<TEXT>
   In her native country, Greta Garbo was
remembered with pride today as an actress whose charisma made her
``the world's best known Swedish emigrant.''
   ``I do not know what it was that made everybody turn around and
keep looking at her when we entered a restaurant,'' Garbo's
longtime friend Mimi Pollack said on Swedish national radio.
   Ms. Pollack and Garbo were fellow students at Stockholm's Royal
Theater School in the early 1920s. Ms. Pollack said they had not
been in touch since Garbo fell ill this winter.
   Swedish film professor Leif Furhammar said he remembered her as
a someone ``who walks down the stairs in such a way that you cannot
take your eyes off her.''
   Torsten Jungstedt, a Swedish film critic, told the Swedish
national news agency TT that Garbo's ``face was perfect for film.
It was a close shot face with an enormous amount of life in it.''
   ``Photographers said it had a light of its own,'' he said.
   Garbo died Sunday in a New York hospital. She was 84.
   She grew up in Soder, a workers' district in southern Stockholm.
Director Mauritz Stiller discovered her at the Royal Theater
School. Stiller and Pollack persuaded her to change her name from
Greta Gustafsson to Greta Garbo.
   Garbo was the first of several Swedes who made international
film careers, including director Ingmar Bergman, and actors Ingrid
Bergman, Max von Sydow, Bibi Andersson, Anita Ekberg, and most
recently Lena Olin.
   Stiller had gone with Garbo to Hollywood in 1925 and tried to
bring her back to Sweden when he returned two years later. But she
stayed on and later became an American citizen, returning to Sweden
to visit only occasionally.

<HEAD>Small Aftershocks Hit Upland Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of small aftershocks to a Feb. 28
earthquake that did $10.4 million in damage jolted residents awake
early today, but no injuries or damage were reported.
   The first aftershock struck at 1:21 a.m. and measured 3.4 on the
Richter scale, said Hall Daily, spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena. It was centered five miles
northwest of Upland, he said.
   The second tremor struck at 1:24 a.m. and measured 2.4 on the
Richter scale, Daily said. It had the same epicenter, he said.
   Police in Upland received several telephone calls from concerned
residents who felt the first tremor, but no damage or injuries were
reported, said Sgt. John Cannon.
   ``It was a rolling one that lasted a few seconds,'' Cannon said.
``It shook our nerves a little bit. I don't need any more of
these.''
   The Feb. 28 earthquake was centered in the same area as the
aftershocks near Upland, which is 40 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles. The quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale and caused an
estimated $10.4 million in damage, according to the state Office of
Emergency Services.
   Today's activity could be felt in nearby Fontana, but police
there also had no reports of damage or injury.
   ``One of the dispatchers who was awake did feel it,'' said
Fontana police Lt. Terry Boess.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded by a
seismograph. An earthquake of magnitude 3 can cause slight damage.
A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Cheney Rebuffs Soviet Complaint on Arms Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney brushed aside
Soviet complaints that a new Bush administration strategic arms
proposal focuses exclusively on land-based missiles, a newspaper
reported today.
   In an interview, Cheney rebuffed a Soviet suggestion that the
administration's proposal be expanded to constrain sea-based
missiles, The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   Looking forward to new arms reductions that would follow a
treaty to be signed later this year, the Bush administration has
proposed a ban on all land-based missiles that carry multiple
warheads.
   The United States has the advantage in sea- and bomber-based
nuclear weapons, while the Soviet Union has more land-based
missiles.
   Some Senate Democrats have argued that the United States should
tell the Soviets it will consider cutting submarine- and
bomber-based weapons after a strategic treaty is completed this
year.
   Cheney suggested the Soviets, despite their complaints, might
agree to the proposal without any guarantees on sea-based missiles
or bomber weapons, the newspaper said.
   Many officials in the Bush administration argue there is no need
to restrict sea- or air-based multiple warheads because of their
comparative invulnerability to pre-emptive attack. Multiple
warheads also are known as MIRVs, for multiple independently
targetable re-entry vehicles.
   ``The argument for de-MIRVing is that land-based missiles make
attractive targets. With MIRVs deployed at sea that piece of the
argument goes away,'' the newspaper quoted Cheney as saying in the
interview conducted last week.

<HEAD>Saudis Taking New Crack at Stopping Oil Overproducers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saudi oil minister today
announced new efforts to bring back into line OPEC partners
violating the cartel's oil production quotas and driving down
prices, an official report said.
   It was the first official Saudi reaction to last week's wild
swings in oil prices as a result of overproduction by some OPEC
members.
   The current situation not only harms ``all producers, but ...
weakens the chances of the anticipated improvement in oil prices
during the second half of the current year,'' Oil Minister Hisham
Nazer was quoted as saying today by the Saudi Press Agency.
   The official agency said Nazer will meet Kuwait's oil minister,
Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, and his United Arab Emirates
counterpart, Mana Saeed Otaiba, in the Red Sea port city of Jiddah
on Tuesday.
   He said consultations with other OPEC states were aimed at
restoring ``their production to the allocated ceiling,'' the agency
reported. ``The kingdom hopes that these contacts will achieve
their aim of restoring stability to the market.''
   The U.A.E. and Kuwait, which along with Saudi Arabia are members
of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, are
considered the two main violators of production quotas fixed by the
cartel. Saudi Arabia is the cartel's leading producer.
   In November, OPEC set an overall production ceiling of 22
million barrels a day for the first half of this year. But OPEC
countries produced about 24 million barrels a day last month, the
Nicosia-based Middle East Economic Survey has reported.
   That was the highest monthly output since 1981, the respected
oil industry newsletter said.
   The U.A.E. has rejected its quota of 1.1 million barrels a day
and has been producing double that. Kuwait has been overshooting
its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day by about 300,000 barrels.
   Their overproduction has been a major factor in flooding the oil
market and thus forcing prices down for the first time in a year.
   OPEC's benchmark price is $18 a barrel, based on a basket of
seven OPEC crudes.
   During the winter, prices shot up as high as $22 a barrel at
times. However, in the recent slide, the widely-traded North Sea
Brent oil, to which many OPEC crudes are linked, fell below $15 a
barrel.

   Julio Gonzalez, charged with torching an illegal
social club and killing 87 revelers, says he wasn't jealous of a
former girlfriend but humiliated by a bouncer who had earlier
kicked him out, a newspaper reported today.
   Gonzalez spoke from the psychiatric unit at Bellevue Hospital to
New York Newsday. A friend of the Cuban emigre's was present, the
newspaper said.
   Gonzalez, who does not speak English, was quoted by the
newspaper as saying he was not angry over rejection by Lydia
Feliciano, his former girlfriend, but was humiliated by the bouncer
who kicked him out of the Happy Land Social Club at Feliciano's
request.
   Gonzalez said he didn't threaten Feliciano, the newspaper said.
Police have said he told his former girlfriend that night, ``You
won't be here tomorrow.''
   ``I never said that,'' Gonzalez told Newsday. ``I told her, `You
have a lot of boyfriends now,' and she ordered them to throw me
out.''
   The March 25 fire at the Bronx club left 87 patrons dead.
   Gonzalez allegedly started the blaze with a dollar's worth of
gasoline. He has pleaded innocent to 174 counts of murder, two
counts of arson and other charges.

<HEAD>Protesters Storm KGB Office In Armenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters attacked a secret police office in
Armenia's capital with stones and torches over the weekend, and one
demonstrator was killed, the official news agency reported.
   In the incident, a crowd of people broke off from an
environmental rally in Yerevan on Saturday night and headed for the
KGB office in the southern republic, Tass reported Sunday.
   Tass said the crowd apparently was angered by the arrest of four
Armenians on charges of stealing weapons from a military unit.
   The attack lasted about two hours, but the crowd was unable to
get inside the building and eventually dispersed, Tass said, adding
that KGB officials inside did not open fire.
   One person was killed when a homemade grenade he was carrying
exploded, Tass said.
   One resident said tanks and armored personnel carriers later
were deployed on the outskirts of Yerevan, but not inside the city.
   Eduard Shakhnazaryan of the Armenian news agency Armenpress said
in a telephone interview today that authorities ``had every right
to sanction opening fire and the attackers could have been shot
like sitting ducks from the rooftop of KGB headquarters, but no
such measure was resorted to.''
   He said residents believe the attack was provoked by forces
``interested in creating chaos in the city with long-reaching
consequences.'' But he did not elaborate.
   Shakhnazaryan said none of the attackers was arrested.
   Alexander Arzumanyan, a spokesman for the Armenian National
Movement, said his group believed the attackers were actually
plainclothes KGB agents circulating at the environmental rally to
instigate the crowd of ``hot heads.''
   The rally began as a protest of the Narit chemical complex,
where an explosion occurred earlier in the day and spewed noxious
fumes into the air, Arzumanyan said.
   Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, national head of the KGB, on Sunday
called the attack ``an onslaught by bandits.'' In a message to the
agency's Armenian branch, he praised the men inside the building
for their restraint.
   However, the Postfactum News Agency, quoting a leader of the
Armenian National Movement, reported that movement members had
rushed to the scene and persuaded the protesters to leave.
   Since Armenia's strained relations with neighboring Azerbaijan
worsened this winter and armed ethnic clashes grew common,
militants have staged dozens of raids on Armenia's arms depots to
obtain weapons to battle Azerbaijanis.
   Attacks against KGB, government and party buildings have
generally increased around the southern Soviet Union in the past
year. Some are aimed at taking arms from police and KGB stocks, and
others have been intended to force political change.

<TEXT>
   ``Nigger Creek'' and ``Dead Negro Draw''
should be wiped off the Texas map, says an NAACP official working
to replace those and other racially offensive place names with
expressions of black pride.
   Gary Bledsoe, NAACP Austin chapter president, said he resolved
to eliminate slurs from the map during an outing two years ago,
when he ran across ``Nigger Creek'' and ``Niggerhead Hill'' within
an hour's drive of the Capitol.
   ``I couldn't believe what I saw and how totally offensive that
was,'' he said recently.
   Many Texas locations were tagged with such names because blacks
lived there at some point. Bledsoe is looking to rename 33 places.
   There are six ``Negro Creeks'' in Texas, a ``Negro Crossing''
near San Angelo and ``Negros Liberty Settlement,'' ``Negro Bend''
and ``Negro Gully,'' all in Liberty County east of Houston.
   ``Negro'' was substituted for ``nigger'' in a comprehensive 1962
name switch by the Board of Geographic Names in Reston, Va. The
board is responsible for deciding which names are used on all maps
produced in the United States.
   But Bledsoe said old maps still are in use, and official name
changes don't always alter what places are called.
   ``It's horrible, the psychological damage that is done by naming
something like that,'' Bledsoe said. ``And these were official
actions.''
   He consulted the librarian of the George Washington Carver
branch of the Austin public library and proposed new names for the
33 sites identified in a computer search.
   Some of the suggested names include ``ebony'' and ``freedom.''
Others honor individuals: John Jefferson, a black-Seminole Indian
scout with the U.S. Cavalry; pianist-composer Scott Joplin; Ada
Smith, an Austin historian who died recently; and Milton Holland,
the first black Texan to win the Medal of Honor.
   Bledsoe said he has the support of other Texas chapters of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   The Travis County Commissioner's Court has worked for months to
change ``Nigger Creek'' and ``Niggerhead Hill'' to ``Warbler
Creek'' and ``Warbler Hill.'' The proposed names are awaiting a nod
from the Board of Geographic Names, which relies on community
approval in deciding such requests.
   Mike Igau, a white man who owns the two sites, said he would
like to see an end to the names that came with the ranch his family
bought in 1910.
   ``Frankly, we never did like the designation anyway, but we
never had anything to do with the naming of it,'' Igau said. ``I
think we need to rename these landmarks if they're offensive to any
group or person.''
   He said the county's proposed names celebrate the rare
golden-cheeked warbler that lives in the region.
   But Bledsoe wants names that promote black pride. ``There are so
few state and national treasures that are named in a way that would
be suggestive of black accomplishments,'' he said.
   The Board of Geographic Names usually approves any name with
overwhelming community support, said Ernie Berringer, chief of
staff for the domestic names committee.
   He said the panel tries to avoid common names, those of living
people and names not somehow related to the area.
   Only two racially offensive geographic names outside of Texas
have been changed in recent years, Berringer said.
   In Yellowstone National Park, ``Chinaman Spring'' is being
changed to ``Chinese Spring.''

<HEAD>Jerusalem Mayor Clarifies Position on U.S. Senate Resolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said today he
fully backs the U.S. Senate resolution affirming Jerusalem as
Israel's capital, contradicting remarks attributed to him by
visiting Senate Republican leader Robert Dole.
   Dole also told a Sunday news conference at the end of an
eight-day Middle East tour that he would tell the Senate he now
opposes the non-binding resolution, which he originally supported
when it was approved March 22.
   ``I conclude (the resolution) was ill-timed,'' Dole said. He
said it was distracting attention in the Arab world from the peace
process.
   Dole said Sunday that Kollek agreed the timing was bad and that
it served no useful purpose.
   But Kollek said today that the resolution had come up during
talks with Dole in the context of an earlier congressional
resolution recommending that the U.S. Embassy be moved to Jerusalem.
   Despite the earlier resolution, the United States, like most
other Western nations, still maintains its embassy in Tel Aviv.
   Kollek said he told Dole ``my concern was that the present
resolution ... would not be acted upon by the administration.''
   He added: ``But this in no way detracts from the importance
which I attach to this decision of the majority of the Senate.
Rescinding the resolution now would only encourage Arab extremism
and harm the peace process.''
   The Senate resolution said: ``Jerusalem is and should remain the
capital of the state of Israel.''
   It was enacted shortly after President Bush said he objected to
settling Soviet immigrant Jews in Arab east Jerusalem, which was
annexed by Israel after it was captured from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The United States has repeatedly said that the status of
Jerusalem should be negotiated with Palestinians, who have demanded
that it be the capital of their would-be independent state.
   Dole also told reporters Sunday that the United States has to
take care of its own homeless before granting Israel's request for
loan guarantees to house Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   ``Charity starts at home and that means America,'' the Kansas
Republican told the news conference. ``We are going to give $400
million to Israel for housing guarantees when we have 3 million
homeless in America and no program for them?''
   Others in the Senate delegation were James McClure, R-Idaho;
Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. The group visited Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq
and Israel before leaving for Washington on Sunday.

   Lithuania's leadership today discussed what to do
about a Kremlin threat to cut off crucial supplies to the Baltic
republic for ignoring a deadline to repeal laws that break with
Moscow.
   As the 48-hour deadline set by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev expired Sunday night, the republic's deputy prime
minister, Romualdas Ozolas, went on Lithuanian television to urge
its 3.8 million people to brace for a ``hectic'' week.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene and members of the Cabinet and parliamentary
leadership discussed ``a plan of economic measures'' in the face of
an embargo by the Kremlin, Vilnius Radio said.
   Such an embargo would include cutting off the supply of oil and
natural gas that the republic buys only from Moscow at subsidized
prices.
   The capital of Vilnius was quiet today as the predominantly
Roman Catholic republic celebrated the final day of a three-day
Easter weekend. Most factories and businesses were closed,
according to a worker in the information office of the Supreme
Council, Lithuania's parliament.
   The full parliament is to meet Tuesday.
   Ozolas also said that Lithuania and Estonia planned to exchange
ambassadors today, according to Aidas Palubinskas of the Lithuanian
Parliament's information office.
   Landsbergis repeatedly has said Lithuania would not abandon its
drive to restore the independence lost when, with fellow Baltic
states Latvia and Estonia, it was forcibly annexed by the Soviet
Union in 1940.
   Gorbachev demanded Friday that Lithuania's leaders rescind
``anti-constitutional'' actions promoting independence or face an
economic embargo. That includes canceling conscription into the
Soviet army and seizing Communist Party property.
   The Soviet president threatened to cut off products the Soviet
Union sells abroad for hard currency if the republic's leaders
failed to act by Sunday. He did not specify the materials, but they
include oil and gas.
   There was no immediate word from the Kremlin today on the
threatened embargo.
   In Washington on Sunday, Senate leaders of both parties warned
Gorbachev that carrying out his threat could hurt efforts to
improve trade relations between the United States and Moscow.
   Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union on
March 11 and has been locked in tense confrontation with the
Kremlin, which has alternated between making threats and
conciliatory statements.
   Soviet troops have occupied some buildings in the capital of
Vilnius and conscripts who deserted the Red Army have been seized
and beaten. Gorbachev also demanded that Lithuanians turn in their
firearms, and the Soviet military asserted itself by sending
armored personnel carriers through Vilnius.
   Palubinskas said Lithuania's factories would be able to function
for only about two weeks if Moscow imposed an embargo.
   He said Ozolas advised his compatriots to rest up, ``because
this week doesn't promise to be any less hectic _ but by next
weekend we'll be happy by what we've accomplished.''
   The spokesman said the Lithuanians consider Gorbachev to have
softened his stance, appearing to back away from an earlier demand
that Lithuania rescind its declaration of independence.
   Earlier in the day, the leader of Lithuania's Roman Catholics
told worshipers in Vilnius to keep a ``cool head'' but stand tough,
a resident said.
   Speaking at an Easter Mass with Landsbergis sitting in the front
pew, Cardinal Vincentas Skadkevicius urged the population of the
Baltic republic to stay calm, said Eduard Potashinskas of
Lithuanian TV.
   In Washington, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said retaliation by Moscow
against Lithuania would jeopardize a trade agreement President Bush
and Gorbachev hoped to sign at a summit in June.
   Lithuanian officials have acknowledged that an embargo of
materials such as oil and gas could cause mass layoffs in the
republic of 3.8 million people but said they hoped sympathetic
Soviet republics would not cut off crucial supplies.
   Lines at gas stations in Vilnius were a little longer than usual
on Sunday as people reacted to the threat, Palubinskas said.
   Besides oil and gas, the Baltic republic also depends on the
Soviet Union for metal, machinery, chemicals, cotton and
automobiles.
   At least four other Soviet republics are now controlled by
progressives who have indicated support for Lithuania's bid for
independence, and some Lithuanians said they were hoping for holes
in Gorbachev's embargo.
   ``We don't think individual republics will go along with this,
especially republics like Azerbaijan and Georgia, which want
independence,'' said Palubinskas.
   Prunskiene said the republic had stepped up efforts to establish
economic ties with the West and was negotiating with West Germany
and Switzerland to print Lithuanian money in case of an embargo,
the official Soviet news agency Tass reported Saturday.
   Latvia and Estonia are also pressing for independence, though
more cautiously than Lithuania. On Friday, they signed an economic
cooperation agreement with Lithuania that promises mutual aid in
emergencies.
   Palubinskas voiced confidence that the Kremlin would not be able
to starve Lithuania into submission, because the republic produces
more meat and milk than it consumes.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Spark Matsunaga, who engineered passage of
legislation paying $1.25 billion in compensation to
Japanese-Americans interned in U.S. prison camps during World War
II, has died at age 73.
   The Democrat died Sunday at a hospital in Toronto after a fight
against cancer.
   The son of immigrants from Japan, Matsunaga was a U.S. Army
veteran of World War II. He was first elected to the House in 1962
and the Senate in 1976.
   In 1988, he won passage of a law that pays $20,000 to each
surviving Japanese-American interned during the war. Matsunaga had
to overcome opposition from some veterans and from those who
objected to the cost of the bill.
   During debate, the senator was forced to halt his comments in
midsentence while telling of an elderly internee killed by a guard
as he went to pick up a softball.
   ``I myself become overly emotional when I think about it even to
this day,'' he said after regaining his composure.
   The first payments under the program are set to begin late this
year.
   Matsunaga was a highly decorated veteran of the war. He was a
member of the 100th Infantry Battalion, which became part of the
``Go for Broke'' 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the most decorated
regiment in U.S. history.
   He was a graduate of the University of Hawaii and had a law
degree from Harvard. Before entering Congress, Matsunaga was a
member of Hawaii's territorial House from 1954 to 1959, the year
Hawaii became a state.
   In the Senate, he also served as the second-ranking Democrat on
the Finance Committee and chairman of its subcommittee on taxation
and debt management. He used those assignments to protect tax
advantages to industries important to the Hawaiian economy,
including tourism, pineapples and alternative energy sources.
   He also served on the Labor and Human Resources and Veterans'
Affairs committees.
   Matsunaga lobbied for 22 years before persuading Congress in
1984 to establish a U.S. Peace Institute. ``Peacemaking is as much
an art to be learned as war'' was his persistent argument.
   Perhaps no other member of the Senate in recent years had been
so attentive to visiting constituents. Almost daily, Matsunaga
could be seen entertaining Hawaiians at lunch in a Senate dining
room.
   Gov. John Waihee, a Democrat, will name a successor to Matsunaga
to serve until a special election in November. Matsunaga's term
runs through 1994.
   Rep. Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat elected to the House in 1976,
is considered the leading choice to succeed Matsunaga.
   Matsunaga's body was to be taken to the state Capitol atrium for
viewing. Services were set for Wednesday and a private burial was
scheduled for Thursday.
   Matsunaga had been plagued by medical ailments, including a
heart attack in 1984, a stomach ulcer in 1987, a serious bout with
the flu and back problems in 1988. He announced in January he had
prostate cancer that had spread to the bone.
   He is survived by his wife, Helene, and five children.

<HEAD>The Party's Over: Weary Youths Head Home From Spring Break In Palm
Springs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weary spring break revelers headed
home Sunday after more than a week of partying that landed some in
the hospital, hundreds in jail and included more than a thousand
arrests.
   ``Everybody's checked out in the first few hours or so. They had
three or four days of partying and they're pretty bushed,'' said
Erich Langmann, owner of the Travelodge hotel. ``The place looks
like a ghost town.''
   Police made 1,348 arrests since the festivities began April 6,
said police Lt. Lee Weigle. He said 719 people were booked into
jail, including 457 accused of being drunk in public.
   More than 6,100 citations also were issued charging violations
ranging from having open alcohol containers in public to breaking
noise limits.
   Hundreds of visitors were treated at Desert Hospital of Palm
Springs for injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to broken limbs,
nursing supervisor Jan Taylor said.
   One man, Paul Williams, 20, of Thousand Oaks, was in serious
condition today at the hospital. He was one of two men who were
struck by a Jeep early Saturday as they crossed a street, Weigle
said. The other man was treated for minor injuries and released.
   The driver, James Dalton, 34, of Rowland Heights, was arrested
for investigation of felony drunk driving, Weigle said.
   During the week-long invasion, the town swelled with an
estimated 60,000 visitors. They cruised the main strip of Palm
Canyon Drive and left it littered with soda cans, beer bottles and
other trash.
   As the revelry subsided, police ended 12-hour shifts that cost
the city $350,000 in overtime, Weigle said. Police began stepping
up security measures after a spring-break riot in 1986, when some
students went on a rampage, harassing motorists, pulling clothing
off women and hurling bottles and rocks at police.

<HEAD>Clashes On Anniversary of PLO Leader's Death</HEAD>

   Israeli soldiers today fired plastic bullets or
used tear gas to break up protests in at least three towns on the
occupied West Bank, as Palestinians marked the second anniversary
of the slaying of a PLO leader.
   Three Palestinians were wounded in the clashes, according to
Arab reports, and the army said one soldier was slightly injured.
   Memorial parades and protests were reported in a half dozen
towns and refugee camps in the occupied West Bank on the
anniversary of the 1988 slaying of Khalil Wazir, the Palestine
Liberation Organization's military commander.
   Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, Arabic for ``father of war,''
was killed in a commando raid in Tunis. The death was blamed on
Israel, but the government has never acknowledged responsibility.
   To head off violence today, the army imposed a curfew and
ordered the 700,000 Palestinian residents of the occupied Gaza
Strip confined to their homes.
   In one clash in the West Bank city of Nablus, soldiers opened
fire with plastic bullets, wounding two Palestinians, Arab reports
said. A 23-year-old Palestinian also was reported shot in clashes
with soldiers in the West Bank village of Beita.
   Also in Nablus, an Israeli soldier was slightly injured in the
right leg when a concrete block was dropped from a rooftop as he
patrolled the crowded central market, the army spokesman's office
and Arab reports said.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, police used tear gas and rubber
bullets to break up a demonstration by Palestinian youths, who
blocked roads with rocks and burning tires.
   At least 10 youths were arrested, Arab reporters said.
   Meanwhile, in Arab east Jerusalem, a half-dozen Palestinian
youths, their faces covered with masks and checkered Arab scarves,
ran along the main shopping street and smashed the windows of at
least five cars.
   One of the masked men jumped on the hood of a car and kicked in
its windshield.
   Several tires were set ablaze, and at least two police vans were
stoned, Arab witnesses said.
   After the incident, police closed the Arab-owned shops along the
street. Witnesses said two youths were arrested.
   Tension has been heightened in Jerusalem since the settlement
last week of 150 Jews in the center of the Arab Christian Quarter
of the Old City.
   There have been at least four demonstrations by Palestinians and
liberal Jews since a 72-room complex was taken over by the Jewish
settlers last Wednesday. The Greek Orthodox Church, which owns the
building, has gotten a court order to have the settlers evicted,
but they appealed.
   Elsewhere, residents of the West Bank town of Tulkarem observed
10 minutes of silence at mid-morning today in Abu Jihad's memory,
local reporters said.
   In the Balata refugee camp outside Nablus, about 500 Palestinian
students marched in memory of the slain PLO leader.
   Israeli troops ordered merchants to close their shops in the
market town of Ramallah north of Jerusalem after slogans were
painted on walls saying ``We are all Abu Jihads.''
   The highest death toll for one day in the 28-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation came immediately
after the 1988 slaying of Wazir. His death set off riots that left
17 Palestinians dead.
   Since the start of the uprising, 673 Palestinians have been
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians. An additional 207
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaboration with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have died in the
violence.

   Police scrabbled through subway-stop garbage
cans looking for the wallet of a gray-haired man who they say shot
and killed his alleged mugger on a train.
   The search continued today for clues that would help identify
the victim who pulled a gun and fired after he was beaten and
robbed by a group of four men on a train in Brooklyn.
   Melvin Kirkland, 17, of Brooklyn, who police say was one of the
attackers, was charged with robbery and assault in the Thursday
incident. No one else had been charged, police said today.
   Witnesses told police the gray-haired man fired three times,
hitting and killing Ricky Pickett, a 25-year-old Brooklyn man with
six robbery convictions on his record.
   The victim left the train at the next stop and disappeared. He
has ignored police pleas to surface.
   Officers continued searching garbage cans and subway stations
Sunday for the gunman's wallet, although they were not certain it
had been stolen, said Officer Hugh Barry, a police spokesman.
   Kirkland handed over a silver handgun allegedly used by the
attackers, police said.
   The attackers were also armed with a retractable razor, police
said. They were among a group of more than a dozen men who were
smoking marijuana and drinking brandy inside the subway before the
assault.
   The shooter is not the only man still at large after killing a
mugger on a train. The ``Subway Samaritan'' disappeared after
fatally stabbing a man who was robbing another subway rider Dec. 9.
The Samaritan has never been identified.
   Bernhard Goetz received national attention after shooting four
youths on a subway train on Dec. 22, 1984. Police said the
incidents differed because Goetz was not attacked before he fired;
Goetz said he believed he was being threatened.

<DATELINE>GALLUP, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters were asked to recall Mayor Ed Munoz
today for waging a campaign against alcohol abuse that his chief
critic says has the rest of the country convinced Gallup is
``nothing but a town of drunks.''
   Munoz, 62, earlier this year threatened to put up billboards
warning motorists at the Arizona line that they were entering the
nation's drunken driving capital. The billboard had a car traveling
on a road paved with skulls.
   ``The rest of the country now thinks this is nothing but a town
of drunks,'' said Linda Tilley, leader of the recall effort and a
part-time waitress and bartender at several nightspots.
   ``We have a Skid Row just like every other city, but our problem
isn't any worse.''
   Munoz, who was mayor from 1958 through 1969 and is in the middle
of his second consecutive two-year term, blamed the recall effort
on the liquor industry.
   ``They have their backs up against the wall and this is their
last attempt to stop what's happening in McKinley County from
spreading to the rest of the state,'' he said.
   The National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse said the
area's rate of alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 people was nearly
six times the U.S. average from 1975 to 1979. In 1987, New Mexico
was the per-capita leader in traffic deaths.
   Gallup adjoins the nation's largest Indian tribe, the Navajos.
Since alcohol is prohibited on the reservation, any drinking is
done in Gallup or other border cities, and Gallup's population can
double or even triple during the day.
   Gallup, population 22,000, in 1988 reported 26,222 instances of
people thrown into the police ``drunk tank'' to sober up, a
significant share of them Indians.
   Munoz and other officials want to start an alcoholism treatment
center.
   He made his billboard threat after legislation to reform liquor
laws stalled in the Legislature. He later withdrew his plan, saying
he merely wanted to get legislators' attention.
   Ms. Tilley said she began the recall drive on other issues, such
as Munoz's alleged efforts to use his position to help friends. The
billboard threat was the clincher, she said.
   Supporters of the recall effort say the city also has lost its
tourist appeal because Munoz brought national attention to Gallup's
alcohol problem.
   ``If you're having a problem with your wife, you're not going to
go down and buy a front page ad,'' said Tilley. ``You try to
resolve it.''
   About 165,000 of the Navajo tribe's 200,000 members live on the
125,000-square-mile reservation that covers parts of Utah, Arizona
and New Mexico. The smaller Zuni Pueblo, also near Gallup, has
about 9,000 members.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Ban on School Dances in Missouri Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ban on
school dances in a Missouri town inhabited largely by Christian
fundamentalists.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the ban
imposed by public school officials is religiously motivated and
therefore violates the constitutionally required separation of
church and state.
   The longtime no-dance rule in rural Purdy, Mo., was upheld by a
three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last
September.
   In November, the full appeals court voted 5-4 not to review the
panel's decision. But dissenting judges called the ban ``religious
tyranny'' that violates the rights of students wishing to hold
school-sponsored dances.
   Officials are not sure when the ban on school dances was
adopted, but fundamentalist ministers in the town long have
preached against social dancing, calling it ``satanic'' and
``sinful.''
   When the ban was challenged in 1986, ministers from five
fundamentalist churches led the opposition to its repeal.
   More than 250 people attended a school board meeting in March
1986 and most stood in unison to signify their opposition to
relaxing the rule.
   Parents and students who want to change the rule sued, and a
federal judge declared the regulation unconstitutional. But the
ruling was overturned by the three-judge 8th Circuit court panel.
   The panel, in an opinion written by Judge George G. Fagg, said,
``Any arguably religious effect of the rule is indirect, remote and
incidental.''
   It added: ``The mere fact a governmental body takes action that
coincides with the principles or desires of a particular religious
group ... does not transform the action into an impermissible
establishment of religion.''
   The ruling was criticized sharply by four 8th Circuit judges who
later tried unsuccessfully to overturn the panel's decision.
   Judge John R. Gibson, writing for the four, said, ``The school
board was motivated by religious purposes. This is a case about
religious tyranny.''
   He said, ``In the overall scheme of things, a dance at Purdy
High School, with an enrollment of 519, may not be of
earth-shattering signficance. Yet, our Constitution protects all
citizens ... from religious ... oppression by a majority.''
   Gibson also said the three-judge panel missed the point in
describing dancing as a secular, non-religious activity. ``The true
issue in the case is whether the no-dance rule has a secular
purpose,'' he said.
   Another dissenter, Chief Judge Donald R. Lay, said the panel
ruling could be ``a devious springboard for further destruction of
the wall separating church and state.''
   The Missouri School Boards Association and the Missouri
Association of School Administrators urged the justices to leave
the ban intact.
   The groups said local school boards should be allowed to
regulate ``the extracurricular use of facilities that is neutral
toward religion and which is consistent with the shared values of
the communities.''
   The case is Clayton vs. Place, 89-1348.

California</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Light rain helped firefighters battling a
600-acre blaze today in the Los Padres National Forest that
apparently was started by an abandoned campfire, authorities said.
   Firefighters had contained 85 percent of the blaze, said Earl
Clayton of the U.S. Forest Service. They expected to have it fully
surrounded by this evening and controlled by Tuesday evening, he
said.
   No buildings were damaged.
   Investigators concluded that an abandoned campfire sparked the
fire Friday afternoon in Hungry Valley State Park, which abuts the
forest, he said. They were trying to determine who may have been at
the site, he said.
   About 280 firefighters were on the line today in the area 25
miles northeast of Ventura. One firefighter suffered a minor leg
injury, another was overcome by heat exhaustion and a third was
treated for a bee sting, Clayton said.
   The blaze broke out in 4,000-foot terrain so steep that
bulldozers and engines couldn't be used. Crews were ferried in by
helicopter, and some hiked in three miles on Saturday.
   Stands of pinon and juniper in the area were tinder-dry from the
state's fourth year of drought. Authorities have said the fire
danger is the worst it has been in decades.
   Firefighters from the U.S. Forest Service, Los Angeles and
Ventura county fire departments, U.S. Bureau of Land Management,
California Department of Forestry and the Los Angeles Fire
Department were on the scene.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Make New York Compensate Former Nursing Home
Owners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to make New
York compensate the former owners of a Buffalo nursing home forced
by the state to remain open even though it was losing money.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the state's
ordering the home's owners to keep it open when they wanted to shut
it down did not amount to a ``taking'' of private property.
   The Constitution allows government, through eminent domain, to
take private property for public use but requires that ``just
compensation'' be paid.
   At issue in the Buffalo case was whether a temporary taking
occurred when Abbott Manor Nursing Home's owners were forced by
state officials to absorb about $30,000 in monthly operating losses
for three years.
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled
last June 8 that no taking occurred.
   The June ruling overturned lower court decisions that there had
been a taking, and that the state owed Abbott Manor's owners
$542,000.
   Before his death in early 1976, Bernard P. Birnbaum owned and
operated Abbott Manor, which had some 80 residents. At the time of
his death, the home was losing between $20,000 and $30,000 each
month.
   As co-executor of his brother's estate, Saul Birnbaum notified
state officials about Bernard's death.
   The state position was that the home could not be closed because
no alternate facilities were available.
   After failed negotiations with state officials, the estate
announced that all Abbott Manor residents would be removed by Sept.
7, 1976.
   State officials, however, obtained a court order blocking the
home's closing and the removal of its residents. Two of the home's
employees were appointed as receivers in charge of operations, but
the Birnbaum estate was forced to pay all costs.
   The receivership was not ended until Sept. 14, 1979, after all
Abbott Manor residents had been placed in other facilities.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Birnbaum family
argued that ``requiring a private business to remain in operation
and to bear substantial operating losses, without providing just
compensation ... is precisely the kind of harm'' the Constitution
prohibits.
   The case is Birnbaum vs. New York, 89-1108.

<HEAD>Court Blocks Sales of Hare Krishna Temples in California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today blocked temporarily
the sales of five Hare Krishna temples to satisfy a $5 million
judgment against the religious sect.
   The justices, granting an emergency request by the Krishnas,
ordered the sales postponed until they consider a formal appeal in
the case.
   The Krishnas had filed the request with Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, saying emergency help was needed ``to save (their)
religion from destruction.''
   O'Connor referred the request to the full court.
   The International Society of Krishna Consciousness and two
Krishna officials were sued successfully by a mother and daughter,
Marcia and Robin George of Cypress, Calif.
   Their lawsuit alleged that Robin had been brainwashed by the
Krishnas when she was 14 and that Krishna leaders conspired to keep
her away from her parents.
   A California jury in 1983 awarded the Georges $32.5 million in
damages against the Krishnas, but the award was reduced on appeal
to $2.9 million.
   With interest, the judgment today is estimated to be in excess
of $5 million.
   A state judge last month ordered that five Krishna temples
already placed under court supervision, including the religion's
headquarters in Los Angeles, be sold and the proceeds be paid to
the Georges.
   Four California courts, including the state Supreme Court,
refused to block that order.
   The state Supreme Court refused last Novebmer to review the
award, and the Krishnas filed an appeal with the nation's highest
court Feb. 28.
   The sales presumably would be unnecessary if the judgment is
paid before they occur.
   Lawyers for the Georges, urging the justices to reject the
emergency request, said no immediate court action is required
because ``it will be almost months before the sale of any assets
... can occur.''
   They added, ``There is no reliable evidence in the record to
support (the Krishnas') allegation concerning the financial
hardships which will befall them if the stay is not granted.''
   Miss George and a friend, 16-year-old Caron Dempsey, visited a
Hare Krishna temple in Laguna Beach, Calif., for the first time in
1974 at Miss Dempsey's suggestion.
   Miss Dempsey later decided to join the religious sect, and
persuaded Miss George to attend meetings at the temple.
   By the fall of 1974, Miss George was wearing a sari while
attending school and chanting and praying at a Hindu-style altar in
her bedroom.
   According to court documents, a Krishna official told Miss
George to leave her home and live at a temple. She did, spending
time at Hare Krishna temples in Laguna Beach, San Diego, New
Orleans and Ottawa, Canada.
   The Georges' lawsuit alleged that Krishna officials conspired to
keep Miss George from her parents, who learned of her whereabouts
in late 1975 only after Miss Dempsey left the religion and told
them.
   In the still-pending appeal filed with the justices in February,
lawyers for the Krishnas said the award won by the Georges amounts
to religious bigotry.
   ``For the first time in this country since the anti-Mormon
frenzy of the 19th Century, an entire religion stands subject to
destruction and the confiscation of its property at the hands of
the state,'' the appeal says.
   It adds: ``The proceeding below turned into a trial of what (the
Georges') counsel called the `pernicious evil' of the Krishna
Consciousness religion, and ... the jury awarded damages ...
calculated to bring the religion in this country to an end.''
   The case is International Society for Krishna Consciousness vs.
Robin and Marcia George, A-682.

<HEAD>Court Says American Jewel Thieves Must Stay in British Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men convicted of a famous London jewel
robbery who want to be moved from a British prison to one in this
country lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that spared the
U.S. attorney general from adopting rules that could have led to
the prison transfers.
   Jerome Scalise and Arthur Rachel are U.S. citizens convicted in
the $3.6 million holdup of a London jewelry store in 1980. Their
haul included the famous Marlborough diamond.
   Authorities said the jewels have not been recovered.
   Scalise and Rachel began serving 15-year prison terms Aug. 6,
1984. They are eligible for release in July 1993.
   The United States and Great Britain ratified a treaty in 1985
that permits prisoners in each nation to be transferred to their
homeland.
   Scalise and Rachel sued in federal court in the United States,
seeking to compel former Attorney General Edwin Meese III to
transfer them home and to adopt guidelines governing prisoner
transfers between Great Britain and the United States.
   Meese and his successor, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
refused to adopt such rules or grant the wish of the two men to
return home.
   A federal judge ordered the adoption of the guidelines, but that
ruling was overturned last December by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   The appeals court acknowledged that the treaty is intended to
help rehabilitate prisoners by letting them return to their
homeland and be closer to family and friends. But it ruled that
such decisions should be left to the attorney general without
judicial second-guessing.
   The case is Scalise vs. Thornburgh, 89-1478.

<HEAD>Court Says Government Doesn't Have to Reveal Information on
Retirees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to order the
government to reveal the names and addresses of retired or disabled
federal workers.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by an
organization seeking to use the information to recruit new members
in its campaign for increased benefits for retirees.
   The National Association of Retired Federal Employees used to
have an agreement with the federal Office of Personnel Management
that helped the association's drive for new members.
   The agency from 1979 to 1981 permitted the association to send
information packets to newly retired federal workers through an
independent mailing service. The association was not given the
names or addresses until recipients of the packets expressed an
interest in joining.
   After the Office of Personnel Management ended the arrangement,
the association sought to obtain the names and addresses under the
Freedom of Information Act.
   A federal judge ruled in favor of the association, but the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here overturned that ruling last July.
   The appeals court said revealing the names and addresses of
retired and disabled workers would violate their privacy.
   The appeals court said that if the association is allowed to
have the names, there would be no basis under the Freedom of
Information Act to withhold the names from others who seek them.
   ``Any business or fund-raising organization for which such
individuals might be an attractive market could get from the
government, at nominal cost, a list of prime sales prospects to
solicit,'' the appeals court said. ``Business people will not
overlook an opportunity to get cheaply from the government what
otherwise comes dearly.''
   By contrast, the appeals court said the retirees association
failed to show there is a public interest in revealing the names
and addresses. ``Even a modest privacy interest outweighs nothing
every time,'' the appeals court said.
   The association said the appeals court misinterpreted the
Freedom of Information Act, a 1966 law aimed at curtailing
government secrecy. The association said Congress intended that
such lists be provided ``unless release would constitute a clearly
unwarranted invasion of privacy.''
   Justice Department lawyers urged the high court to reject the
association's appeal.
   The case is National Association of Retired Federal Employees
vs. Newman, 89-1098.

   Greta Garbo, the husky-voiced, Swedish-born
screen legend who turned her back on Hollywood in 1941 to live
according to her best-remembered line _ ``I vant to be alone'' _ is
dead at 84.
   The reclusive Garbo died Sunday, said Andrew Banoff, spokesman
for New York Hospital. At her family's request, Banoff gave no
other information except that donations should be made to a kidney
treatment center at the hospital.
   Ben Buttenweiser, who lived in an apartment below Garbo's, said
the actress had undergone dialysis treatment.
   With her sculpted beauty, Garbo first gained attention in silent
films. When talkies came along, Hollywood worried that her accent
and throaty voice would end her career, but they only enhanced her
appeal, and she became an international sensation with such films
as ``Anna Christie,'' ``Mata Hari,'' ``Grand Hotel'' and ``Queen
Christina.''
   She reigned in Hollywood in the '30s. Public response to her
face and her lithe figure in silky halter gowns was so frenzied
that the phenomenon had a name: ``Garbomania.'' Some critics
considered her the finest screen actress of all time.
   But Garbo disliked the attention and quit at age 36, her 24
films keeping her name alive for generations.
   While ``Camille'' and ``Ninotchka'' became film festival
standards, the woman known worldwide simply as Garbo remained
practically shuttered in her Manhattan apartment, where she moved
after becoming a U.S. citizen in 1951, or in various retreats in
France and Switzerland.
   When she traveled, she slipped in and out of airports in dark
glasses and a slouch hat. ``Garbo watchers'' would wait hours
outside her apartment, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.
Photographers who stalked her occasionally stole a quick shot of
``The Face.''
   In ``Grand Hotel,'' one of her lines was, ``I vant to be
alone.'' Legend has it she used it on reporters who dogged her. But
she denied it, telling a friend she actually had said, ``I want to
be let alone.''
   Nominated four times for an Academy Award, she didn't win until
1955, when the Academy gave her a special Oscar for ``a series of
luminous and unforgettable performances.'' Garbo did not appear to
collect it.
   ``As an actress and as a person she had this very special thing
about her that I think sort of set her apart,'' actor Jimmy Stewart
said. ``It was a combination of the way she looked, her voice and
the beautiful way she moved.''
   ``She was always a living, unreachable myth ... the founder of a
religious order called cinema,'' Italian director Federico Fellini
said.
   ``She gave cinema the sacredness of Mass,'' he told the Italian
news agency ANSA.
   She never married, but rumors of her love affairs with rich and
famous men were abundant. Over the years, she was linked with actor
John Gilbert, maestro Leopold Stokowski and Russian-born
entrepreneur George Schlee.
   In comments published in Life magazine in 1989, Garbo described
herself as a ``sour little creature.''
   ``I don't want any kind of attention from anybody, except that I
know that someone likes me, and that's nice. Otherwise, it's
sickening,'' she said.
   In the rare interviews she gave, she said ``you cheapen
yourself'' in telling others ``your private joys and sorrows.'' She
said she preferred to let her work speak for itself.
   Neighbor Buttenweiser, who said he knew Garbo for 35 years, said
he sometimes discussed world developments with her but that she
would not talk about her film career.
   Carl Peterson, a doorman in her building, said he last saw her
last week. ``She had gray hair and was very thin. She looked very
pathetic,'' he said.
   Born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson in Stockholm, Garbo was the
daughter of an uneducated laborer who was often ill or unemployed.
After her father died when she was 14, she left school and earned
$25 a month as a department store clerk.
   While clerking, she was chosen to appear in a filmed hat
advertisement. The 17-year-old was stagestruck and enrolled in
Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theater Academy. She won several small
parts, the first in a 1923 comedy, ``Peter the Tramp.''
   Her big break came when Mauritz Stiller, then Sweden's leading
director, made her his protege, changed her name to Garbo and cast
her as the star of his 1924 movie ``The Saga of Gosta Berling.''
   At first sight of Garbo on film, Stiller said, ``Her face. You
only get a face like that in front of a camera once in a century.''
   Stiller's film caught the attention of Hollywood tycoon Louis B.
Mayer, who offered the director a contract at MGM. Stiller agreed
on condition Garbo be signed too.
   For her first talking picture, the studio cast her in ``Anna
Christie,'' which called for an accent. Publicity slogans
proclaimed, ``Garbo Talks!''
   Later, the comedy ``Ninotchka'' prompted marquees across America
to blaze ``Garbo Laughs!'' But her next attempt at a humorous role,
in ``Two-Faced Woman,'' flopped and Garbo announced her retirement.
   Film buffs can recite her first lines on camera: ``Gimme a
viskey _ ginger ale on the side _ and don't be stingy, baby.''
   A millionaire through wise investing, Garbo _ who reportedly was
earning $250,000 to $300,000 a picture by the 1930s _ had no need
to work again and never did.
   A health buff, she was rarely ill.
   The hospital spokesman said he didn't know who the family
members were who requested details of her death be withheld, but
neighbors said she had a niece.
   He said services would be private.

<HEAD>Aquino Confirms British Troops Training Filipinos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino confirmed
today that British troops are training Filipino security forces,
after renegade officers promised to attack what they called British
mercenaries in the army.
   Last week, the Young Officers Union, a shadowy group believed
linked to December's failed coup, claimed British mercenaries were
training Philippine forces in ``a clear violation of Philippine
sovereignty.''
   Asked about the claim, Mrs. Aquino said there were no
mercenaries training her forces.
   ``However, there is a team of British military engaged in
training the PSG (Presidential Security Group) on military
activities, and this was done at the request of the Philippine
government,'' she added.
   The British Embassy was closed today for the Easter holidays.
The Presidential Security Force guards Mrs. Aquino and foreign
dignitaries.
   The Union warning was the first directed against the British
since the Dec. 1-9 failed coup, in which 113 people were killed and
more than 600 wounded.
   Rebel soldiers have frequently warned the United States to avoid
``meddling'' in Philippine affairs after U.S. jets flew air cover
for government forces during the coup attempt.
   The failed coup was the sixth and bloodiest bid so far to oust
Mrs. Aquino.
   A fugitive ex-army officer suspected of playing a leading role
in December's coup attempt said in an interview that mutineers gone
into hiding will not surrender ``until this government shapes up.''
   Former Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan did not specify what changes he
wanted but criticized alleged corruption and incompetence.
   ``It (the December coup attempt) may have failed tactically or
it may have been a setback tactically. But you have to agree that
just like August in 1987, it has really jolted this administration
into, for once ... (setting) directions,'' Honasan said.
   ``That's all we ask,'' Honasan added. ``And then we can probably
surrender. And then you can save on the 5 million on my head,''
Honasan said in an interview for the U.S. Cable News Network.
Portions of the interview were carried today by the Manila Times
newspaper and a private television station Channel 7.
   He was referring to the 5 million peso ($227,000) reward offered
by the government for information leading to his arrest.
   Honasan initially supported Mrs. Aquino when she came to power
during the 1986 ``people power'' revolution.
   Mrs. Aquino dismissed Honasan's statement, saying he was merely
repeating criticism of her government that he has made since
breaking away.
   In another development, the military announced today that 18
more communist rebels were killed in an air assault on 300 New
People's Army guerrillas who surrounded a 100-man army patrol
Friday on the central island of Negros.
   The latest casualties bring to 81 the number of rebels killed
since the military launched an offensive on March 29, the 21st
anniversary of the founding of the New People's Army, said Brig.
Gen. Raymundo Jarque, the Negros military commander.
   No casualties on the government side were reported.
   The New People's Army, the military wing of the outlawed
Communist Party, has been waging an insurgency to establish a
Marxist state in the Philippines.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Pension Issue in Texas Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether workers may sue in state courts when they allege their
employers fired them to avoid paying pension benefits.
   With millions of dollars at stake, the court said it will use a
Texas case to decide whether such state lawsuits are precluded by a
federal law protecting pension benefits.
   The court is expected to rule sometime in 1991.
   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Ingersoll-Rand Co.,
which was sued by fired sales representative Perry McClendon.
   McClendon was transferred by the company from San Antonio to
Dallas in 1979 to develop a sales market there for the company's
construction equipment. He was fired on Nov. 19, 1982, four months
before his 10th anniversary with the firm.
   A worker with 10 years experience is entitled to have his
pension vested, meaning the employer must contribute to the
employee's retirement benefits.
   McClendon sued in state court in Texas, accusing Ingersoll-Rand
of firing him to avoid paying pension benefits. The company said it
dismissed him to reduce its workforce and save money.
   The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA) protects workers' pension rights.
   But McClendon did not sue in Texas courts for lost pension
benefits. In fact, shortly after he sued, the company agreed to
vest his pension.
   McClendon sought a potentially big-money judgment for lost
future wages, mental anguish and punitive damages.
   The Texas Supreme Court last October overruled lower state
courts and revived the lawsuit, ordering a trial.
   Many states accept the principle that an employer's ability to
fire a worker at will is limited by public policy, the state court
said. For example, the state court said, workers may claim they
were fired illegally because of sex, race or age discrimination or
for exercising their collective bargaining rights.
   ``We hold that public policy favors the protection of integrity
in pension plans and requires in this case an exception to the
employment-at-will doctrine,'' the state court said.
   McClendon is entitled to damages if he can prove he was fired
because Ingersoll-Rand wanted to avoid paying pension benefits, the
state court said.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups urged the
U.S. Supreme Court to overrule the Texas court and hold that the
federal pension law pre-empts such lawsuits.
   The Chamber of Commerce said lawsuits by fired workers against
their former companies already have mushroomed.
   The organization cited one study showing the national average
for damage awards based on wrongful firing rose from $227,280 in
1986 to $311,332 in 1987.
   Allowing fired employees to sue over the pension issue will
prompt thousands of additional suits that could be devastating to
American business, the Chamber of Commerce said.
   It noted that the aging of the so-called baby-boom generation
already poses a threat to the financial stability of pension plans.
   If the Texas court ruling is upheld, the Chamber of Commerce
said, ``At the same time that pension plans are being put to their
most stringent financial tests, thousands of employees who are
about to vest in their pension rights will be able to bring
(lawsuits) for wrongful discharge seeking extensive compensatory
and punitive damages.''
   The case is Ingersoll-Rand vs. McClendon, 89-1298.

   A preacher said he put barbecued rabbit on the
menu of his Easter meal for the homeless to dramatize their plight
of the poor and to stress that the true meaning of the holiday has
nothing to do with bunnies.
   ``Jesus Christ did not tell us to give each other some cuddly
little Easter Bunny,'' said the Rev. Larry Rice as the hungry and
homeless lined up Sunday at the New Life Evangelical Center. ``He
told us to feed the hungry.''
   Christians celebrate Easter to mark the day they believe that
Jesus rose from the dead.
   On the menu Sunday were more than 300 grilled rabbits, served
with sauce or without _ plus corn and green beans, carrots, pasta,
hard-boiled eggs and chocolate cake.
   Diners also were given soap, razor blades, shampoo and deodorant
_ ``stuff you can't get with food stamps,'' Rice explained.
   Rice said the Easter supper of rabbit was a deliberate publicity
stunt to carry his message that ``there are too many people hungry
in America to waste food.''
   Yvonne Dozier, seated at dinner with her 8-month-old baby, said
those at Rice's tables found the meal ``a blessing.''
   ``There ain't no such thing as the Easter Bunny, and I ain't no
kid,'' she said. ``This is just food _ good food.''

   King Birendra today bowed to a
groundswell for further democratic reform and asked a veteran
opposition leader to be prime minister of an interim government,
the opposition party announced.
   Earlier today, Birendra announced the resignation of Prime
Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and the dissolution of the
partyless legislature.
   The developments ended a week of political deadlock that ensued
after the king yielded on April 8 to demands that a 29-year-old ban
on political parties be banned. That move came two days after a
bloody clash between troops and pro-democracy demonstrators that
left as many as 200 people dead.
   Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, the prime minister-designate and
acting president of the long-banned Nepali Congress Party, said he
will present a Cabinet on Tuesday.
   Bhattarai also said King Birendra indicated during a meeting
today with opposition leaders that he will look favorably upon the
idea of becoming a constitutional monarch, foresaking the
near-absolute power he has wielded for his 18 years on the throne.
   There was no immediate comment from the palace.
   Bhattarai told reporters he was surprised by the offer to become
prime minister.
   ``It's a very, very challenging task for which I was not at all
mentally prepared,'' he said. ``I do not know to what extent I
shall be able to do something for all those who have given their
lives for the cause of democracy.''
   An earlier statement issued by the Nepali Congress said King
Birendra first offered the prime minister's job to Ganesh Man
Singh, supreme leader of the party. Singh, 75, declined, citing
poor health.
   Singh said general elections for a new Rashtriya Panchayat, or
National Assembly, would be conducted before April 1991. The
balloting would be the first multiparty election in the Himalayan
kingdom in three decades.
   Bhattarai said his government will include members of the United
Left Front, a coalition of communist groups that had joined the
Nepali Congress in the people power movement.
   Also today, a youth gang set fire to a movie theater ticket
office and stoned another empty cinema, prompting the capital's
four other theaters to close. Riot police were deployed, but no one
was reported injured.
   It was not immediately clear why the gang targeted the movie
theaters, located 500 yards from the royal palace.
   Witnesses said the attackers were members of Mandale, a
secretive group that had supported the royal family before
switching allegiance to National Assembly members who were upset at
losing their jobs.
   In a royal proclamation on government radio today, King Birendra
announced Chand's resignation and the dissolution of the Rashtriya
Panchayat, or national assembly, conceding the two major
pre-conditions of pro-democracy leaders for joining an interim
government.
   ``In view of the events that have taken place in certain parts
of the country, the people's aspirations and the ideals of
democracy, we have been making political changes,'' Birendra said.
   Chand had been named prime minister April 6, replacing a
hard-liner in one of the king's last moves to try to contain the
growing pro-democracy movement. But demonstrators were not
satisfied.
   A few hours later, police unleashed the bloodiest crackdown in
Nepal's modern history. Witnesses said as many as 200 protesters
were killed as thousands marched on the palace. The government put
the death toll at 10.
   ``This is progress in the right direction,'' Yog Prasad
Upadhyaya, secretary-general of the Nepali Congress, said of
Birendra's announcement, which came eight hours after talks between
Chand and leaders of the 7-week-old pro-democracy movement broke
down.
   The collapse spurred a violent protest by hundreds of
demonstrators who had gathered outside the academy where the talks
were held. Cars belonging to Chand and Foreign Minister Pashupathi
Rana were destroyed, and demonstrators initially refused to allow
the politicians to leave.
   Three times during Sunday's talks, protesters had burst through
the gates of the academy, demanding the government give in to the
opposition.
   Birendra's father, King Mahendra, banned political parties in
1961 after two years of Western-style party government headed by
the Nepali Congress. Mahendra dismissed the government, accusing it
of corruption and inept administration.
   Since then, the king has shared power with a largely
rubber-stamp national assembly. The monarch nominated one-fifth of
the assembly's 140 members and, according to poitical observers,
approved the nominations of the others standing for election.
   Observers say the current campaign is succeeding because of a
growing belief among the country's 17 million people that genuine
democracy may help Nepal to counter widespread poverty.
   The picturesque kingdom is one of the poorest countries in the
world and has a per capita yearly income of $150. Only 25 percent
of the population can read and write, and 11 percent of all babies
die before the age of one year.

<TEXT>
   Members of the National Commission on AIDS
got a first-hand look at the problems of rural AIDS patients today
as they visited patients and health care workers in southern
Georgia.
   ``They're trying to learn whatever problems they (AIDS
sufferers) face getting treatment in rural areas,'' said commission
spokesman Thomas Brant, who was traveling with the 11 members
making the trip.
   AIDS victims in many rural areas have to travel long distances
for medical care and are often treated as outcasts by those who
think of the disease as a big city problem, health officials and
activists say.
   The panel planned to attend briefings and meet with AIDS
patients, doctors and health officials in Waycross, Albany and
Macon.
   In the country, AIDS still is sometimes a dirty word, said Dr.
Ted Holloway, director of a 16-county health district in
southeastern Georgia.
   ``There's a big stigma ... about being gay, or being a drug user
or being HIV positive,'' he said.
   ``We've had people lose their jobs and get kicked out of their
apartments. ... There's a lot of self-blame. People become totally
dependent on their families, living in fear about how people will
react to their disease.''
   Holloway said some patients are afraid to tell the truth to
their insurance companies and instead try to pay for expensive
tests and drugs out of their own pockets.
   A spokesman for Rainbow Partners, a year-old support group in
Waycross, said rural residents tend to think of AIDS as a big city
problem.
   ``They see it on TV and say, `We don't have that here.' They
have the attitude it's just a bunch of (homosexuals) and drug
addicts,'' said the spokesman, who identified himself only as
Charles. ``Once they meet someone who had AIDS it becomes
personalized and changes their attitudes.''
   Of the 3,488 AIDS cases reported in Georgia since January 1987,
the eight-county Atlanta area had 2,549. Holloway's district was
second with 237 cases. His district, about the size of the state of
Massachusetts, has a population of 275,000 and includes the city of
Savannah.
   ``We don't have large gay communities like the big cities,''
Holloway said. ``It's been hard to mobilize community activities
because we don't have that leadership from the gay community.
People are just beginning to realize the problems we face.''
   Health officials are concerned that a syphilis epidemic in
Georgia foretells a surge in AIDS cases in years to come. The
epidemic is believed to be linked to the practice of trading sex
for crack. In southeastern Georgia, syphilis cases jumped from 48
in 1984 to 500 last year.
   ``We've talked to HIV-positive crack addicts who are having sex
with 30 or 40 people a month,'' Holloway said. ``There's just got
to be transmission occurring.''
   Holloway said rural areas need money for AIDS and drug treatment
programs and for drugs such as AZT that can prolong the life of
people infected with the HIV, or AIDS, virus.
   Dr. Paul White, district health director in southwestern
Georgia, which has had 97 reported AIDS cases in three years, said
poor people from Albany have to make a 350-mile round trip to the
AIDS clinic at Atlanta's Grady Hospital once a month for treatment
and a supply of drugs.
   The AIDS commission, made up of scientific and legal experts,
was created by Congress in 1988 to coordinate the federal attack on
AIDS.

<HEAD>Bush Starts Race at White House Easter Egg Roll</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush blew a whistle and eight
youngsters charged across a stretch of White House grass this
morning, pushing hard-boiled eggs with plastic spoons.
   But for one contestant, 7-year-old Michael Angel, the annual
Easter Egg Roll was an Easter Egg Run. He sprinted across the
10-yard course with his egg in the spoon.
   ``He's pretty's cool,'' Michael said afterwards of the race
starter, who made a brief appearance with his wife, Barbara, as
parents and children craned their necks to see them.
   Thousands of youngsters spilled over the White House lawn in the
annual Easter Monday ritual that began in the 19th century. At
least 20,000 were expected by day's end.
   Marshall Bush, the president's granddaughter who turns 4 next
month, was in the same race with Michael Angel and his 5-year-old
sister, Mia. Both girls used the more conventional approach of
pushing the egg forward with the spoon instead of running with it.
   President Bush started only one of the races, expected to
continue through the day.
   Mia Angel said the president was ``fun,'' but ``he didn't shake
my hand.'' A stepbrother, Jason Planakis, did manage to get a
presidential handshake.
   Egg rolling was not the only activity on the White House lawn
under blue skies and temperatures near 70 degrees. There were
clowns, troubadours, an Abe Lincoln look-alike, balloon-blowers,
minstrels and a hunt for wooden eggs, many signed by celebrities.
   All of the Easter Egg Roll entrants received the same reward:
colored wooden eggs bearing the names of George and Barbara Bush.
   Some of the parents and children were queued up outside the
White House gates for an hour or more.
   ``I want to get my face painted,'' said Chad Hampton, 9, of
Herndon, Va., who came with his sister, mother and other friends.
``I got lucky. I got a balloon.''
   ``We got up at 6 a.m. We left at 7 and were down here at 8:15,''
said his mother, Margie Hampton, who took the morning off from work
as a medical social worker. ``Don't ask me if it's worth it. But
what we do for kids!''

   A leaking gas cylinder exploded and
burned in a passenger train in eastern India today, killing at
least 80 people and injuring 65 others, officials said.
   Local reporters said at least 100 people died in the fire, which
raged through two train cars before firefighters extinguished it.
   The 16-car train was passing through Patna, 500 miles southeast
of New Delhi, when the fire broke out at 9:30 a.m.
   ``The heat was so intense no one dared to enter the train for at
least a half hour after the fire,'' said District Magistrate S.K.
Sharma, the top civil administrator in the Patna region.
   ``The outer shell of the bogies (cars) was intact, but the
inside was terrible,'' he said.
   United News of India quoting local officials said at least 80
people died.
   Mathew John, the director of safety for the Federal Railway
Board in New Delhi, said two cylinders of flammable gas caught
fire. He said one of the cylinders was leaking and apparently
ignited when someone lit a match.
   Sharma said a cylinder of oxyacetylene gas, used in welding
operations, was found in the burned cars.
   Press Trust of India said many bodies were buried under
smoldering wooden berths and heaps of luggage.
   The news agency said 10,000 people converged on the site in
Patna, capital of Bihar state, one of the poorest of India's 25
states.
   The train, which was traveling from Mokammeh to Arrah, is widely
used in the mornings by workers commuting to the state capital.
   More than 10 million people ride Indian trains every day, and
major disasters are reported every year. Trains are jammed, with
people often riding on the roofs.
   One of the worst train accidents in recent years occurred in the
southern Indian state of Kerala on July 8, 1988, when 103 people
died when a train plunged into a lake near Quilon.
   Two derailments in 1989 claimed 131 lives: 67 near Jhansi in
Uttar Pradesh in north central India on April 18 and 64 near
Mughalsarai in eastern Bihar on Nov. 1.
   India's 38,320 miles of tracks form the world's third-largest
rail network after those in the Soviet Union and the United States.

<HEAD>Group Says China Pressuring Governments To Halt Pro-Democracy Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radio ship headed to the Far East to transmit
pro-democracy broadcasts into China has been the target of
surveillance and harassment by Chinese officials since it left
France, its sponsors said Monday.
   A coalition of sponsoring groups, headed by the French magazine
Actuel, said China has tried to pressure various foreign
governments in an effort to undermine the ``Boat For China''
operation.
   It said the 260-foot Goddess of Democracy, which set sail from
France on March 17, ``has been the target of administrative
harassment, especially in countries where it stopped, and of
constant surveillance and intimidation by the Chinese authorities.''
   The 1,200-ton ship, a former British oceanographic vessel, is
sponsored by 18 press organizations from several countries in
concert with the Federation for Democracy in China, a Paris-based
organization of Chinese dissidents.
   The coalition said the ship has recently left Djibouti, on the
Horn of Africa, after being held in port for several days for
``various technical and administrative reasons.''
   It described the project as ``totally peaceful, with no
protection except that of international public opinion.''
   Actuel said its editorial offices in Paris were burglarized and
ransacked over the weekend. It said documents and computer disks
related to the ship were stolen as well as a word processor
belonging to a reporter covering the ``Boat for China'' operation.
   The ship is equipped with two radio studios and a television
studio. Its crew hopes to begin broadcasting music and news into
China from international waters by the end of April.
   China has formally protested to France about the boat but was
told there was no official French involvement in the project.
France rejected China's request to restrict news coverage of the
operation.
   The Chinese also have protested the presence in Paris of Chai
Ling, a student leader of the pro-democracy movement that was
crushed in Beijing last June. France is considering her application
for political asylum, filed after she escaped from China earlier
this month.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Claim Victories as Food Aid Begins to Flow To War-Torn
Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church groups announced Monday that
convoys bearing food for starving Ethiopians had started moving
into war-torn areas after months of separate talks involving the
government and rebel forces.
   A convoy of 55 trucks carrying supplies left the city of Dessie
in Wollo Province bound for Mekelle, the provincial capital of
neighboring Tigre Province, church spokesmen said in Addis Ababa.
   Seven other trucks will distribute food in outlying areas, the
church spokesmen said.
   A bulldozer was sent ahead of the convoy to clear roads washed
away by heavy rains and flooding, the Rev. Francis Stephanos,
president of the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, told
The Associated Press.
   The Evangelical Church along with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church
and the Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat have formed a consortium
that recently was granted permission by the government and the
rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front to distribute emergency
supplies in war-torn Wollo and Tigre provinces.
   On the battlefront, another rebel army, the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front, claimed to have killed more than
800 government troops in two separate offensives last week in Wollo
Province, north of Addis Ababa, according to a clandestine rebel
radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi.
   The guerrilla armies are fighting the Marxist government of
President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   Both the guerrillas and the government often make claims of
battlefield victories that can rarely be verified, as independent
observers are barred from the war fronts.
   The Democratic Front rebels claimed they destroyed a commando
brigade and two commando battalions, killing 721 government
soldiers, wounding 410 and capturing 351 in fighting around the
towns of Ataye and Karakore. The towns are about 110 miles north of
Addis Ababa.
   In a second clash at Degaga, the Democratic Front claimed its
forces had destroyed two government battalions, killing 151
soldiers and wounding 223. There was no mention of prisoners.
   The fighting has made it difficult to get foreign relief
supplies to hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians who face starvation
in Tigre and Wollo provinces.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front claims to control northern
Wollo and and most of Tigre and has in the past few months been
distributing foreign-donated relief aid itself.
   The Liberation Front has accused relief officials of delaying
the distribution of food in the two provinces by claiming poor road
conditions. The rebel group said the highway is in good condition
and had been used by tanks.

   The bus, bound for Rawalpindi about 10 miles away, had stopped

two people on the bus, and they escaped unhurt.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, and police refused to

   Gunmen in a speeding car killed a
commander of the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia in west
Beirut on Monday, police reported.
   An Amal official said Ali Abu Hasan, the militia's commander in
the Zokak el-Blat district of the city's Moslem sector, was
assassinated by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Abu Hasan
died shortly after he arrived the American University Hospital.
   Police said Amal militiamen later took to the streets, firing in
the air and raiding apartments near the scene of the slaying in an
apparent search for the killers.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah and the more secular Amal have been
fighting off and on for more than two years for control of
Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed and at least 3,000

<TEXT>
   An Albanian national has fled into the
Greek Embassy in the Albanian capital and asked for asylum, a
diplomat at the mission said Monday.
   Bernard Kici, a 38-year-old Roman Catholic electrician, entered
the embassy in Tirana on Sunday morning and ``asked for our help in
providing religious and political asylum,'' Charge d'Affaires
Pantelis Karkabassis said in a telephone interview.
   Public worship and religious institutions were outlawed in the
hard-line Communist nation in 1967.
   ``There has been no contact (between the Greek and Albanian
governments) so far, but we expect talks to take place shortly to
find a solution,'' Karkabassis said.
   The Albanian authorities last March allowed Sotiris Antoniou, an
ethnic Greek who had sought asylum in the Greek Embassy, to leave
the country legally.
   Greece estimates about 400,000 ethnic Greeks are living in
Albania, the last bastion of Stalinism in Europe. Tirana says the
Greek minority numbers 60,000 at most.
   Despite rejecting reforms that have swept Communist monopolies
from power in Eastern Europe, Albania has shown some signs of
easing its self-imposed isolation.
   Last month, the government began considering moves to liberalize
the penal code and create a justice ministry to oversee the courts.
It also opened direct telephone links with the West.

   A multimillion-dollar fire at a cable TV

   There were no injuries stemming from the blaze at the

   Forty firefighters took more than an hour to extinguish the
fire, Marek said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the

in damage.
   It was unknown when service would be restored.
   ``We're asking customers to be patient,'' said Al Kuolas, a

   Cablevision serves about 280,000 customers in the metropolitan
area, Kuolas said.

   At least 80 people died of food poisoning
and more than 125 others were hospitalized after a village feast to
celebrate a marriage engagement, United News of India reported
today.
   An inquiry was ordered into the cause of the deaths after the
Sunday night dinner. United News said preliminary investigations
indicated a sulfur compound had contaminated the flour used for
making puri, a puffy fried bread.
   The ``tilak'' ceremony and feast were held in Raipura Jungla
village near Lucknow, capital of the nothern state of Uttar Pradesh.
   During the ceremony, engaged couples exchange rings and feast
with their families. A tilak is a decorative dot many Indians,
especially Hindus, wear on their foreheads for auspicious occasions.
   UNI did not say whether the engaged couple was among the victims.

   Defendant Keith Mondello organized the white
gang that surrounded and killed a black teen-ager last summer, a
prosecutor said today at the opening of the trial of two men
charged in that attack.
   The death of Yusuf Hawkins raised racial tensions in a city that
was then in the middle of a mayoral campaign.
   ``The evidence in this case is going to show you that an unarmed
16-year-old boy who went with three friends to look at a used car
was surrounded and killed by a gang organized by this defendant,''
assistant district attorney James Kohler told the jury.
   The case against codefendant Joseph Fama, 19, allegedly the
triggerman in the murder of 16-year-old Hawkins, was scheduled to
start later in the day in the same courtroom. But lawyers said Fama
was sick with the flu, and the opening of that case was in doubt.
   Fama, 19, and Mondello, 20, are the first of eight white men
from the largely Italian Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to go on
trial in the fatal shooting Aug. 23 of Hawkins.
   Two juries sitting side-by-side were chosen for their
simultaneous trials to speed justice.
   A mob of 30 or more men who attacked Hawkins after he ventured
into Bensonhurst with three friends to check out a used car for
sale.
   The judge, state Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus E. Owens,
ordered two juries to hear evidence in the same courtroom, rather
than hold separate trials for Fama and Mondello, to save time.
   Many in the Bensonhurst mob, which prosecutors recently revealed
included a black man, were armed with baseball bats. The group had
gathered in a schoolyard to protect their turf from outsiders.
   Fama and Mondello are charged with murder, riot, assault,
menacing and other crimes. They could get 25 years to life in
prison on the murder charge.

<TEXT>
   An alleged drug kingpin and two other inmates
escaped from a privately run prison across from the police station
after one of them pulled a gun on a guard, authorities said.
   Five federal agencies plus Mexican, Texas and local officials
were searching today for the men who escaped Sunday evening. They
include Mario Alberto Salinas Trevino, who federal authorities
allege masterminded one of the largest drug-smuggling and
money-laundering rings between Texas and Mexico.
   Police said the three men may be heading to Mexico and are
considered armed and dangerous. At its closest point, the border is
about 100 miles away.
   Salinas, 37, was among 25 people arrested in March 1989 in a
drug operation dubbed ``Operation Jet Set.''
   U.S. Marshal Bill Jonas said $10 million was seized from Salinas
then, and he's suspected of having up to $10 million in drug money
stashed in a hideaway either in Texas or Mexico.
   Prosecutors charge that between 1983 and 1989, a drug ring
Salinas helped run was responsible for transporting more than
46,000 pounds of marijuana and 1,900 pounds of cocaine. The ring
allegedly distributed the drugs throughout Texas, Pennsylvania,
California, Illinois, Florida and Massachusetts.
   The ring also is accused of laundering of more than $7.6
million, using financial institutions in San Antonio and Roma,
Texas and San Ysidro, Calif., to launder narcotics profits.
   Jonas identified the other inmates as Charlie Edward Compton,
58, and Juan Chapa Garza, 44. Compton was awaiting trial on federal
charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Chapa
was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.
The charges were not related to the ``Jet Set'' probe.
   Compton and Salinas are U.S. citizens, Jonas said. He wasn't
sure about Chapa's nationality.
   The three were cellmates at the Central Texas Parole Violators
Facility, a minimum- to medium-security prison in the old Bexar
County jail operated by Wackenhut Corp. of Coral Gables, Fla.
   Compton summoned a guard, claiming he was ill, and pulled a
handgun on him shortly before 9 p.m., Jonas said.
   The three then locked up two guards in the closet and
overpowered another guard on the ground floor before seizing the
security control panels and opening a door, Jonas said. They fled
on foot.
   According to police reports, San Antonio police weren't notified
of the jailbreak until nearly an hour after the three men had
escaped.
   But Wackenhut spokesman Pat Cannan said police were notified 15
to 20 minutes after the jail break by the guard on the ground
floor, who was tied up outside.
   ``It took him about 15 to 20 minutes to get unloose and he ran
straight across the street to the police department,'' Cannan said.
``That was the proper thing to do.''
   Jonas said he had no indication that Wackenhut had delayed the
reporting unneccessarily.
   Wackenhut officials speculate the pistol was smuggled into the
prison during Easter Day visiting hours, Cannan said. He spoke in a
telephone interview from Coral Gables. Jonas said the gun was
believed to be a .25-caliber.
   ``We suspect it was brought in by a visitor,'' he said. Cannan
said the prison screens visitors, but he declined to give details.
   The inmates were being held in the private facility for the U.S.
Marshal's Service, Cannan said. The 620-capacity prison was housing
583 people Sunday, about 100 of them Marshal's Service prisoners,
Cannan said. The prison has 125 guards, 20 to 25 per shift, he said.
   The Marshal's Service has summoned assistance from the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Adminstration, FBI, Customs Service, Immigration and
Naturalization Service and Mexican customs, Jonas said. State and
local officials also were involved in the search.

Symptoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel inmates started a fire at
Strangeways Prison early today and three more prisoners
surrendered, suffering from suspected food poisoning, prison
governor Brendon O'Friel said.
   The last seven prisoners still holding out may have eaten food
gone bad in the 16-day siege or even rat poison scattered in the
aging building, O'Friel said.
   One inmate became so sick overnight with suspected food
poisoning that other inmates asked prison staff to take him to
hospital, and two others surrendered, saying they felt unwell,
O'Friel said.
   ``It is possible these three prisoners are suffering from some
form of very serious food poisoning, maybe salmonella,'' he told
reporters.
   ``For some time we have been concerned about the state of their
food supplies and we have become increasingly worried that they may
have been eating contaminated food or water,'' O'Friel told
reporters.
   Prison officers went into the prison about 2:20 a.m. when heavy
smoke was seen billowing from the building, but the fire was
considered doused at 3:15, according to a Home Office spokesman.
   ``There was a danger to life _ both to the prison officers who
went in to fight the fire and to the inmates,'' said the spokesman,
who spoke anonymously in line with British custom. There was no
word of any casualties, he said.
   O'Friel appealed to the last seven rebels to surrender, urging
them not to let the siege end in ``some sort of tragedy resulting
from food poisoning or other illness.''
   The inmates stockpiled large amounts of food before more than
1,500 inmates at the 900-capacity prison rioted on April 1.
However, they have no refrigeration in the wing they are occupying.
   On Sunday, the rebels displayed a large sign saying: ``We was
coming down today but because some of the boys departing last week
got broken arms and legs we are staying one more week.''
   Authorities categorically denied violence had been used against
surrendering inmates.
   One prisoner accused of sexually assaulting three children died
from injuries in the rioting and a prison guard died of a heart
attack. Several inmates who surrendered earlier claimed they had
seen dead bodies inside, but others insisted there had been no
deaths.
   Most prisoners gave themselves up soon after the riot sparked by
overcrowding in the Victorian-era facility.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $931,000
libel award won by a former CIA deputy director who resigned amid
allegations of improper business dealings.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by two brothers
successfully sued by former Central Intelligence Agency official
Max Hugel.
   Hugel sued Thomas and Samuel McNell over a July 14, 1981,
article published in The Washington Post under the headline, ``CIA
Spymaster Accused of Improper Stock Practices.''
   The McNells were stockbrokers in the mid-1970s when they had
business dealings with Hugel that turned sour.
   Tom McNell provided the newspaper with tape recordings of
telephone conversations with Hugel intended to support allegations
that Hugel engaged in illegal securities transactions.
   Hugel resigned as deputy director of administration at the CIA
after the article appeared.
   He sued the McNells for libel in federal court in New Hampshire,
Hugel's home state. Hugel did not sue the newspaper.
   The McNells, who are from Maine, dropped out of sight and did
not emerge until 1987, when they were arrested on federal charges
of fraud and shipping stolen goods across state lines. They pleaded
guilty and were sentenced to prison.
   Samuel McNell has been freed from prison and is living in
Portland, Ore. His brother remains in prison in California.
   While the McNells were in hiding, a federal judge in 1984 ruled
they had defaulted in the libel suit. Hugel was awarded a default
judgment of $931,000.
   The McNells said they were treated unfairly in the case, saying
they were unaware of the lawsuit until they emerged from hiding _
and thus were denied a chance to show in court that the sued-over
article was true.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the award last
year, ruling that the trial judge had the authority to grant the
default judgment.
   ``The McNells knew that release of the allegedly false
information would have a devastating impact on Hugel, and it can be
fairly inferred that they intended the brunt of the injury to be
felt in New Hampshire where Hugel had an established reputation as
a businessman and public servant,'' the appeals court said.
   Even if the McNells' defense to the libel claim had merit, that
does not justiify overturning a judgment based on their failure to
appear in court to defend themselves, the appeals court said.
   The case is McNell vs. Hugel, 89-1270.

   Striking teachers shut nearly a quarter of
Oklahoma's school districts today and thronged to the state Capitol
to protest the Legislature's failure to pass an education reform
bill that would have included pay raises.
   Thousands of teachers and their supporters, chanting and
carrying signs, crowded the plaza on the Capitol's south entrance
and picketed around other nearby state buildings.
   The 30,000-member Oklahoma Education Association, representing
80 percent of the state's teachers, called a five-day statewide
walkout last week. Nancy Jewell, OEA vice president, said classes
had been dismissed this morning at 143 of the state's 606 school
districts.
   ``We would never accept a 48th ranking in sports,'' read one
protest sign, referring to what the teachers say is Oklahoma's
ranking among the states in teacher pay. The minimum beginning
salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree is $15,060.
   Ms. Jewell the crowd around the Capitol at more than 10,000 and
said more teachers were expected to arrive in buses later in the
day. Other estimates ranged from 5,000 to 15,000.
   The OEA's delegate assembly is scheduled to meet Friday to
discuss the teacher walkout.
   ``At that point, we'll decide what's next,'' said Karla Feeley,
OEA spokeswoman. ``Of course, if the problem is solved before
Friday, that'll be another matter. But at this point, we're
committed for one week.''
   The teachers are incensed by a state Senate vote that killed an
emergency clause to the school reform and tax bill.
   The measure has been the work of an eight-month special session
Gov. Henry Bellmon called last August to come up with ways to
improve Oklahoma schools.
   The emergency clause would have made the measure effective
immediately.
   After the Senate voted Wednesday to drop the emergency clause,
legislative leaders got the Senate to send the bill back to
committee to keep it from going to Bellmon without the emergency
clause.
   The bill would have made number of changes, including proposals
to set greater equity in the way state funds are allocated, salary
increases for teachers, a school consolidation plan, and a program
to close schools that don't meet accreditation requirements,
   It would have provided an additional $212 million for schools
that could be used for teacher salaries and other items. It also
proposed $1,500 increases in minimum teachers' salaries for each of
the next four years.
   Much of the opposition stemmed from the supporting tax plan,
which called for a half-cent increase in the state's 4-cent sales
tax, and increases in corporate and personal income tax.
   The OEA does not believe the walkout is illegal, Ms. Feeley said.
   Bellmon asked the state's attorney general, Robert Henry, on
Friday to take ``all action necessary to prevent illegal disruption
of the education of Oklahoma schoolchildren.''
   Henry's office was researching what steps to take. Assistant
Attorney General Ned Bastow Jr. said last week that a 1981 statute
makes strikes against a local school board illegal, but it's not
clear if the prohibition applies to statewide strikes.

<HEAD>Man Who Sued Hospital for Saving His Life Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who sued a Cincinnati hospital for
keeping him alive in 1988 has died.
   Edward H. Winter, 84, died Saturday at the Hillebrand Nursing
Center in suburban Cheviot. He sued St. Francis-St. George Hospital
in November 1989 to allege negligence and battery because hospital
staff members saved his life after he suffered a series of heart
attacks in May 1988.
   Winter's lawsuit, which is pending in Hamilton County Common
Pleas Court, claims the hospital ignored his expressed wish that no
extraordinary measures be taken to save his life.
   The hospital has denied ignoring Winter's wishes, saying he had
not given specific instructions.
   The family has not decided whether to pursue his lawsuit, said
his daughter, Lynn Kroger. Winter's lawyer, William Knapp, was out
of his office and could not be reached for immediate comment today.
   Legal experts have said the case could break new ground because
hospitals are not normally held liable for saving a life.
   A funeral service is scheduled Wednesday.
   Following a heart attack on May 25, 1988, Winter said, he
requested that no extraordinary measures be used to keep him alive.
He charged in his lawsuit that hospital workers ignored the ``do
not resuscitate order'' when he suffered a second heart attack and
used electric shock to keep him alive.
   Two days after he was revived from the second heart attack, he
suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side and
unable to care for himself.
   He suffered mentally and physically following the stroke, Mrs.
Kroger said.
   The lawsuit seeks to recover the costs of Winter's medical care
since May 1988, estimated at more than $100,000.

   Supporters of exiled King Michael on
Monday yelled back at what they claimed was a government-sponsored
rally against the monarch's planned visit to his native land.
   Several hundred pro-monarchy demonstrators shouted ``Communists
go to church!'' and ``Long live the king!'' as they tried to
prevent an anti-king rally in front of government headquarters.
   There was some pushing and kicking between the rival groups but
eventually they dispersed quietly, and there were no arrests.
   Later, about 300 supporters of the monarch signed a petition
they planned to send to the Supreme Court asking for a visa for
King Michael.
   ``The government, in withdrawing the visa, has violated the
Helsinki Accords on human rights,'' said Noni Andronescu, a
supporter of King Michael.
   The 68-year-old former monarch was forced to abdicate by a
Soviet-installed government on Dec. 30, 1947, and now lives in
Switzerland. He planned to visit his homeland for 10 days on a
private trip.
   The Bucharest government last week revoked Micheal's visa,
forcing him to cancel what would have been his first Romanian visit
in more than 42 years.
   His supporters claim that those opposed to the king's visit are
former Communists backed by the National Salvation Front
government, the main contender in May 20 elections.
   ``We don't want a king!'' shouted a woman who was among
approximately 100 people marching down the city's boulevards toward
the government building to show approval for the visa revocation.
   ``Communists in disguise, go home or to church! It's a holiday
today!'' scores of the exiled monarch's supporters shouted back.
Monday is celebrated as the second day of Easter in most of Europe.
   The demonstrators shouted anti-government slogans and demanded
that former Communists be barred from senior administrative jobs
for the next 12 years.
   Police initially stopped the anti-king rally from taking place.
Later, they allowed about 500 demonstrators to enter Victory Square
after they displayed a letter stating they had the mayor's approval
to assemble there.
   The anti-king march had been previously announced on television,
but the other rally was spontaneous, said Victor Alexa, one of the
participants.
   Those opposed to the monarch accused King Michael of not doing
enough for the nation while it was ruled by Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   There has been no official explanation for the withdrawal of
Michael's visa, but some Romanians believe interim president Ion
Iliescu and Premier Petre Roman, both former Communists, were
concerned their opponents would earn political mileage from the
trip.
   Michael said after Ceausecu's overthrow in December that he was
prepared to return to Romania as head of a constitutional monarchy
but indicated that this would have to be subject to a referendum.

<BYLINE>Leaking Gas Container Explodes On Indian Train, Kills At Least
80
^By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leaking gas cylinder exploded in a
moving commuter train on Monday and set off a fire that left at
least 80 people dead and 65 others wounded, news reports and
officials said.
   Reporters at the scene said the explosion and fire killed at
least 100 people.
   Fire swept through two of the train's 16 cars as it traveled
near Kumrahar in Bihar state, 500 miles southeast of New Delhi. The
fire began at 9:30 a.m.
   Firefighters eventually extinguished the blaze, but ``The heat
was so intense no one dared to enter the train for at least a
half-hour after the fire,'' said S.K. Sharma, the top civil
administrator in the region.
   Sharma said a cylinder of oxyacetylene gas, used in welding, was
found in one of the gutted cars.
   ``The outer shell of the bogies (cars) was intact, but the
inside was terrible,'' Sharma said in a telephone interview.
   Mathew John, the director of safety for the Federal Railway
Board in New Delhi, said two cylinders of gas caught fire. He said
one of the cylinders was leaking and apparently ignited when
someone lit a match.
   Ram Naresh Singh, a survivor, was quoted by Press Trust of India
as saying that because ``I would not be able to save anyone and
would get killed myself, I jumped off the train.''
   The United News of India quoted local officials as saying at
least 80 people died and 65 were wounded.
   The Passengers Welfare Association said the train had no
emergency brake.
   ``It is the most neglected train running in the state. There is
no light, no water, and even no alarm chain,'' said association
President Rameshwar Pandey.
   Press Trust of India said many bodies were buried under
smoldering wooden berths and heaps of luggage.
   Bihar is one of the poorest of India's 25 states.
   The train, which was traveling from Mokammeh to Arrah, is widely
used by morning commuters to Patna, the state capital.
   More than 10 million people ride Indian trains every day, and
major disasters are reported every year. Trains are jammed, often
with people riding on the roofs.
   One of the worst train accidents in recent years occurred in the
southern Indian state of Kerala on July 8, 1988, when 103 people
died after a train plunged into a lake.
   Two derailments in 1989 claimed 131 lives: 67 near Jhansi in
Uttar Pradesh in north central India on April 18, and 64 near
Mughalsarai in eastern Bihar on Nov. 1.
   India's 38,324 miles of tracks form the world's third-largest
rail network after those in the Soviet Union and the United States.

   Lawyers for the Contemporary Arts Center and
its director pleaded innocent today to misdemeanor charges alleging
that photographs in an exhibit of the late Robert Mapplethorpe are
obscene.
   Attorney H. Louis Sirkin entered the plea in Hamilton County
Municipal Court on behalf of the center and director Dennis Barrie.
   The court's assignment commissioner referred the case for trial
to Municipal Judge David Albanese and scheduled a pre-trial hearing
April 30, when a trial date may be set. The date must be set within
90 days.
   A Hamilton County grand jury indicted the gallery and Barrie on
April 7. Five of the 175 photos in the exhibit show homosexual acts
and two show children revealing their genitals.
   Lawyers filed the pleas about two hours before a scheduled
arraignment before Municipal Judge Dennis Helmick in the Hamilton
County Justice Center, said Martin Pinales, an attorney in the firm
handling the case.
   The exhibit has been drawing large crowds _ more than 23,000
during its first week _ and is scheduled to continue through May 26
before moving on to Boston.
   Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur Ney handed over prosecution to
the city of Cincinnati last week, saying Ohio law prohibits him
from prosecuting misdemeanors.
   Some city officials accused Ney of getting rid of a case too hot
to handle and too flimsy to prosecute.
   ``We can't dictate to the city solicitor whether or not to
proceed with the case, but we can certainly make our views known,''
said Councilman Peter Strauss. ``I personally think they are going
to have a hard time making a case that the show in its entirety
lacks artistic value.''
   Fifty-nine percent of those who responded to a poll conducted
for The Cincinnati Post said they believe the photographs should be
displayed.

   A Soviet Aeroflot jet landed in this
port city Monday to begin an airlift of 100,000 copies of the Koran
to the Soviet Union, a gift to Soviet Moslems from Saudi King Fahd.
   The operation is being organized by the Mecca-based Moslem World
League.
   Saudi Araba is home to Islam's holiest shrines. It has no formal
diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.
   The League's secretary-general, Abdullah Omar Naseef, said the
royal gift was made possible by the changes brought about by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The copies of the Moslem holy book were printed in Arabic at the
King Fahd Printing Complex in Medina.
   Naseef said the consent of Soviet authorities to distribute the
Koran among Moslems in the Soviet Union was an indication of the
great changes taking place under Gorbachev.
   A delegation from the League recently visited the Soviet Union
to make arrangements for the distribution.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider
shielding businesses from some big-money lawsuits by fired workers.
   The justices said they will use a Texas case to decide whether
workers may sue in state courts when they allege their employers
fired them to avoid paying pension benefits.
   Business leaders, saying millions of dollars are at stake, want
the high court to rule that such state lawsuits are precluded by a
federal law protecting pension benefits.
   The federal law is aimed at assuring workers will get their
retirement pay. State lawsuits potentially are far more lucrative
because workers can win punitive damages that greatly exceed lost
pay.
   The justices are expected to rule sometime in 1991.
   In other action, the court:
   _Left intact a ban on dances at public schools in Purdy, Mo.,
where most residents are fundamentalists and some believe social
dancing is ``satanic.''
   _Let stand a $310,000 award against Los Angeles County stemming
from a county jail inmate's 1984 suicide.
   _Left intact a $931,000 libel award won by former CIA deputy
director Max Hugel, who resigned in 1981 amid allegations of
improper business dealings.
   _Refused to make New York compensate the former owners of a
Buffalo nursing home forced by the state to remain open even though
it was losing money.
   In the pensions case, the court agreed to hear an appeal by
Ingersoll-Rand Co., seeking to kill a suit by a fired worker.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups support
the appeal. They contend the federal Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) has exclusive power to protect pension
rights and pre-empts state lawsuits.
   The Chamber of Commerce said lawsuits by fired workers against
their former companies already have mushroomed. The organization
cited one study showing the national average for damage awards
based on wrongful firing rose from $227,280 in 1986 to $311,332 in
1987.
   Allowing fired employees to sue over the pension issue will
prompt thousands of additional suits at a time when many pension
plans are being burdened by the aging of the so-called baby-boom
generation, the Chamber of Commerce said.
   Ingersoll-Rand was sued by Perry McClendon, who was transferred
by the company from San Antonio to Dallas in 1979 to develop a
sales market there for the company's construction equipment. He was
fired on Nov. 19, 1982, four months before his 10th anniversary
with the firm.
   A worker with 10 years experience is entitled to have his
pension vested, meaning the employer must contribute to the
employee's retirement benefits.
   McClendon sued in state court in Texas, accusing Ingersoll-Rand
of firing him to avoid paying pension benefits. The company said it
dismissed him to reduce its workforce and save money.
   McClendon did not sue in Texas courts for lost pension benefits.
In fact, shortly after he sued, the company agreed to vest his
pension.
   Instead, McClendon sought a potentially big-money judgment for
lost future wages, mental anguish and punitive damages.
   The Texas Supreme Court last October overruled lower state
courts and revived the lawsuit, ordering a trial.
   The state court said an employer's ability to fire a worker at
will is limited by public policy. For example, the state court
said, workers have grounds to sue when they claim they were fired
because of sex, race or age discrimination or for exercising
collective bargaining rights.
   ``We hold that public policy favors the protection of integrity
in pension plans and requires in this case an exception to the
employment-at-will doctrine,'' the state court said.
   McClendon is entitled to damages if he can prove he was fired
because Ingersoll-Rand wanted to avoid paying pension benefits, the
state court said.

<TEXT>
   For two years, neighbors in a tree-lined
section of this New York City suburb saw what they thought was a
typical family living in a nice house.
   Police say the family may have been part of a front for a drug
factory that polluted the septic system and well of two homes with
chemicals that may have been used to process cocaine.
   ``They mowed the lawn, did the gardening,'' said Lt. Thomas
Johnston, commander of the Westchester Police Narcotics Unit.
``What they did was ruin the neighborhood.''
   The family paid the rent and all other bills by cash and used
fake names.
   Neighbors spotted at least two children, but nobody is sure how
many there were. The children were not sent to schools, and the
family was seen only on weekends.
   ``During the week, a light was on and no one suspected anything.
They blended in and no one was any wiser,'' said Johnston.
   No one ever saw deliveries being made, said Johnston, but the
chemicals probably were brought in in small quantities.
   One day last summer, they vanished from this Westchester County
town about 30 miles north of Manhattan, leaving the toxic mess that
authorities say may cost $100,000 to clean up.
   When the owners returned last autumn from a two-year stay in
Japan, they found hazardous chemicals in the well and septic tank:
tetrachloroethene, acetone toluene and dichloroethene, which comes
from tetrachloroethene.
   The chemicals are used for processing cocaine but have
industrial uses, such as for dry cleaning. But police say they are
leaning toward the drug processing theory.
   Rocco A. Mastronardi, Jr., assistant county public health
engineer, said his department was checking wells in the area _
where homes range from $300,000 to $400,000,
   Samples from the well and septic system taken in March contained
4,000 parts per billion of the tetrachloroethene and 14,000 per
billion of dichloroethene, officials said. Quantities above 5 parts
per billion are considered hazardous with long-term exposure.
   Owner Max Marx and one neighbor have been filtering their well
water for drinking.
   The pollution has seeped to the leaching field and affected
surface water leading to Wampus Pond, a county recreation area, but
Mastronardi said none has been found in the pond itself.
   The state says Marx is responsible for the clean up.
   Marx, who is trying to get state or federal Superfund money to
help pay, said the people who rented his house ``were very nice.''
   He said they replaced carpeting, rerouted electricity and
repainted to cover their tracks.
   Marx, who declined to say what he does for a living, called the
evidence of a drug factory ``circumstantial.''
   No one has been arrested.
   ``We got started six months in the hole,'' said Johnston.
``Every name they used was fictitious.''
   Drug factories or stash houses for money are not uncommon in the
metropolitan area suburbs, and more people are starting to pay
attention to suspicious activities by their neighbors, said Mary
Cooper, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   ``We've seen everything from apartments to farmhouses used,''
she said.

   A teen-ager pleaded guilty Monday in the
kidnapping of the son of industrialist and former Nixon
presidential aide Jon Huntsman and the stabbing of an FBI agent.
   Nicholas Hans Byrd, 19, pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated
kidnapping and aggravated assault in the 1987 abduction. Byrd, who
had contested being charged as an adult, entered the pleas before
3rd District Judge Homer Wilkinson.
   Defense attorney Walter F. Bugden Jr. said he expects his client
will serve at least five years under the plea agreement.
   Byrd was charged with kidnapping then-16-year-old James Huntsman
in December 1987 and demanding $1.1 million in ransom from his
father. He also was charged with stabbing FBI agent Grant Alan
Jacobsen as authorities rescued the Huntsman youth in a phone booth
used to arrange a transfer of the ransom money.
   Byrd, who was 17 at the time, was charged under a law allowing
direct filings in adult court against juvenile defendants in
certain criminal cases.
   The aggravated assault charge, a third-degree felony that
carries a term of up to five years, was reduced from an original
count of second-degree attempted homicide, Bugden said.
   Byrd remains free on a $20,000 property bond. Sentencing was
scheduled for June 7.
   The elder Huntsman served as a special assistant to President
Nixon in 1971-72.

   Fire swept through the government's main
conference center in New Delhi on Monday, forcing the evacuation of
more than 400 police and state government officials who were in
meetings. No deaths or injuries were reported.
   More than 250 firefighters and 45 fire vehicles continued to
fight the blaze seven hours after it started at 4 p.m.
   The United News of India news agency said the fire at the
five-story Vigyan Bhawan, or house of knowlege, may have been
caused by an electrical short circuit. But senior police officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, did not rule out arson.
   Meanwhile, a second fire broke out in the Sadar Bazar business
section of the Indian capital late Monday, police said. There were
no reports of casulties, but police said several shops burned to
the ground.
   More than 100 senior police officials were meeting in Vigyan
Bhawan for a scheduled conference when the fire broke out. They had
adjourned for a tea break when the blaze began. Additionally, 300
officials of state government's Information and Cinematography
Departments also were inside the complex when the fire started.

   A 16-year-old boy's death by a police
officer's bullet marks a call to action for blacks to renew their
fight against racial insensitivity, the Rev. Jesse Jackson messaged
to mourners today.
   ``It is Eastertime. We must meditate, but we must march,'' said
Jackson in a message read at the funeral of Phillip Pannell, who
was fatally shot Tuesday by a white police officer in Teaneck.
   ``We must not be docile, but decisive,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson's message was read by the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor
of the Pannell family. The civil rights leader dictated it to
Daughtry from London, where he is meeting with South African
apartheid opponent Nelson Mandela.
   More than 300 people packed the Community Baptist Church, and
hundreds more gathered outside to hear the services through a
public address system.
   ``We're here to support this grieving family,'' said Martha
Bolds of Paterson, one of those who listened from outside the
church.
   ``This mother's hurt is every mother's hurt,'' Ms. Bolds said.
``We are concerned about raising black boys in this society.''
   The wake for Pannell Sunday night at Community Baptist Church
drew several black leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, Black
Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan and Moses Stewart, the father of
Yusuf Hawkins, who was killed in a racial incident in New York.
   A candlelight vigil Wednesday in Teaneck to mark Pannell's death
turned violent when scores of black youths overturned police cars,
smashed windows and looted businesses. Police said the situation
was calm Sunday night.
   Pannell's father, Phillip Sr., was helped out of the church
Sunday crying.
   ``My son, my son, they shot him in the back,'' he said.
   Sharpton said he planned to lead a march through Teaneck to
protest the shooting, but the date of the event was unclear.
   Pannell was shot Tuesday by Teaneck Officer Gary Spath, who
authorities said was responding to an anonymous tip that a
teen-ager was brandishing a gun. An autopsy by the Bergen County
medical examiner showed Pannell was shot once in the back. Spath
has been suspendended with pay while the incident is investigated.
   Police said that officers believed the teen-ager was reaching
for a gun. Police said a .22-caliber gun was found on the body,
while some of the dead boy's friends have said he had a BB pistol
instead.
   A grand jury begins hearing evidence in the case Tuesday.

   At least 87 people died of food poisoning
after a feast to celebrate a marriage engagement in a northern
village, Press Trust of India said Monday.
   More than 150 others were hospitalized after Sunday's dinner in
Raipura Jungla near Lucknow, capital of the Uttar Pradesh state.
   Other guests streamed to hospitals, complaining of stomach
ailments. Additional doctors were rushed to the area.
   An inquiry was ordered into the cause of the deaths. United News
of India said preliminary investigations indicated a sulfur
compound had contaminated the flour used for making puri, a fried
bread.
   There was no indication whether the engaged couple was among the
victims.
   In rural areas, such ceremonies are attended by entire villages,
drawing hundreds of people.

<HEAD>Three Inmates Surrender At Strangeways Prison, One ``Very Ill''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three sick prisoners surrendered
Monday on the 16th day of a siege at Strangeways Prison, and one of
the rebels was described as ``very ill'' with what was believed to
be food poisoning.
   The prison head, Brendon O'Friel, speculated the men were eating
contaminated food or water in the Victorian jail, where there have
been no fresh supplies since a riot April 1.
   O'Friel appealed for the remaining seven rebels to give
themselves up.
   Two of the prisoners who surrendered carried a third inmate on a
stretcher. He was rushed to hospital.
   ``One boy is, I am afraid, very ill,'' said Mary Stewart, vice
chairman of the prison's Board of Visitors. ``He was semiconscious
when they brought him down. He had been hemorrhaging from the
mouth.''
   Mrs. Stewart, a magistrate and former nurse who has been at the
prison most of the time since the riot began, said all three
inmates showed the same symptoms.
   ``It is possible these three prisoners are suffering from some
form of very serious food poisoning, maybe salmonella,'' O'Friel
said.
   ``My appeal to the remaining seven is: if any of you are feeling
ill, I strongly advise you to come down and let us get you to
hospital. I do not want this to end in some sort of tragedy
resulting from food poisoning or other illness.''
   More than 1,500 prisoners rioted at the overcrowded prison April
1 and caused severe damage to the buildings. Most surrendered in
the first days, but some remained on the loose. The number of
holdouts dwindled day by day to the seven holding out Sunday.
   The prisoners stockpiled large amounts of food before the riot,
but there was no refrigeration in the wing they were occupying.
   ``The meat they have been eating is now so rotten they cannot
eat it,'' Mrs. Stewart said, adding food cans ``have been left open
for 16 days ... It is very doubtful from where they are getting
water from.''
   O'Friel said ``another possibility with an old prison like
Strangeways is that there are areas of the prison where we have
been trying to prevent a spread of rats and they may have eaten rat
poison.''
   Earlier Monday, the rebel inmates started a serious fire, but
there was no indication any of the prisoners were injured.
   The prisoners said Sunday they would carry on their siege
another week, alleging that fellow rebels who had surrendered ``got
broken arms and legs.'' Authorities denied the accusation.

   The Bush administration and the National
Wildlife Federation clashed before the Supreme Court Monday over
what it takes to prove an individual has been harmed by opening
federal lands to commercial development.
   The Justice Department asked the high court to reverse a June
ruling from the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.
The ruling gives environmentalists potentially sweeping power to
prevent the restricted public lands from being opened to mining and
mineral exploration.
   The appellate ruling said the federation may sue the Interior
Department over the government's plans to change the status of 180
million acres of public land in the West and Alaska.
   The appellate came after the federation presented affidavits
from members who said they use some of the land for recreation.
   Peggy K. Peterson said the Bureau of Land Management's decision
to allow mining ``in the vicinity of'' South Pass-Green Mountain,
Wyo., has adversely affected her recreational use and aesthetic
enjoyment of the federal lands.
   ``In particular, the South Pass-Green Mountain area of Wyoming
has been opened up to the staking of mining claims and oil and gas
leasing, an action which threatens aesthetic beauty and wildlife
habitat potential of these lands,'' she said in an affidavit.
   Federation spokesman David Alberswerth said Monday that a high
court decision against the environmentalists would prevent them
from challenging reclassification of land initiated by the Reagan
administration in 1985 following a policy instituted by
then-Interior Secretary James G. Watt in 1981.
   ``It will severely constrain the opportunity for environmental
groups such as ours to take the government to court,'' Alberswerth
said.
   The federation said the Reagan administration violated the
federal law by opening the land to development without following
procedures in the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act, such
as conducting environmental impact statements.
   The issue before the Supreme Court is whether Peterson and the
federation's 4.5 million members have standing in the case _ or the
right to sue _ based on damage to their recreational use and
aesthetic enjoyment of the lands.
   John G. Roberts Jr. of the Justice Department told the justices
that Peterson and others have been too vague in explaining the harm
and the specific area where the harm has occurred.
   He said they should be required to show damages on specific
tracts of land where commercial development has been approved.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan arrived Monday on a three-day visit to Mecca, and
diplomatic sources said she would discuss a variety of issues with
King Fahd.
   Bhutto, the only woman head of state in the Moslem world, was
accompanied by a 45-member entourage, including her husband, Asif
Ali Zardari, senior Cabinet ministers and high-ranking military
officials.
   The Saudi monarch is in Mecca for the last third of Ramadan, the
Moslem holy month of fasting.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be named, said
Bhutto and Fahd were expected to discuss rising tension in the
Indian state of Kashmir. Kashmir is an area on the border with
Pakistan where Moslem separtists have been fighting for an
independent state.
   Hindus comprise a majority in India, but Kashmir is the
country's only Moslem-dominated area. The Saudi-based 46-member
Organization of Islamic Conference has expressed concern about the
clashes.
   Pakistan and India have gone to war twice over Kashmir.
   Afghanistan also is expected to be discussed. Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia are supporters of the Moslem rebels who are fighting the
Soviet-backed government.
   Bhutto's trip comes when her ruling party is trying to smooth
differences with the Mojahir Qami Movement, which represents Moslem
immigrants from India who entered Pakistan after the 1947 partition
of the subcontinent.
   The movement withdrew its support from Bhutto's government last
November, claiming it reneged on promises to the party. The switch
allowed the opposition to force a no-confidence vote in Parliament,
which Bhutto narrowly survived.

   A center-right coalition won a
majority in Slovenia's free parliamentary elections and will form
the first non-Communist regional government in Yugoslavia in 45
years, according to official results released Monday.
   The April 8 election in the northern republic was the first free
multiparty vote in Yugoslavia since the Communists took power in
1945.
   The official results showed that the DEMOS coalition, consisting
of six center-right parties, received 55 percent of the vote for
places in the republic's 140-seat Parliament.
   The Slovenian Communist Party, which has ruled the republic,
will remain the largest single party in Parliament with 17 percent
of the vote.
   The Slovenian Liberal Party, which campaigned apart from the
DEMOS coalition, emerged as the second-largest single party in
Parliament with 14.49 percent.
   The Slovenian Christian Democrats were the largest vote-getters
among the six parties within DEMOS, with 12.98 percent.
   The remainder of the vote was split among eight other parties.
   Slovenia will choose its first freely elected president since
the end of World War II in a runoff Sunday between DEMOS leader
Joze Pucnik, who advocates the republic's secession from
Yugoslavia, and Milan Kucan, a reform Communist.
   Neither of the two managed to gain more than 50 percent support
in the first round of presidential elections April 8. Kucan
garnered 44.5 percent of the votes. Pucnik had 26.6 percent.
   Croatia, the second-largest Yugoslav republic, is also scheduled
to stage multiparty parliamentary elections Sunday.
   The democratic reforms in Slovenia and Croatia have been
implemented despite harsh criticism from the largest republic,
Serbia. Its leaders support continued Communist Party dominance in
Yugoslavia.

   Most Americans say it should be illegal to kill
animals for fur coats or to use them for cosmetics research,
according to a poll released Monday.
   Eight in 10 respondents to the survey for Parents magazine said
animals have some rights. Majorities disapproved of killing animals
for sport or for making leather, but most did not favor outlawing
those activities.
   The survey was conducted by telephone from Sept. 22 to Oct. 10
among a random sample of 1,004 Americans age 21 and older. It had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Eighty-five percent disapproved of killing animals to make fur
coats, and 63 percent said it should be illegal. Eighty-one percent
disapproved of cosmetics research on animals, and 58 percent said
that should be illegal.
   At the same time, 85 percent said it was acceptable to kill
animals for food; about two-thirds accepted capturing animals for
exhibit in zoos or training animals to perform for humans; and 58
percent accepted using animals for medical research.
   While 69 percent disapproved of killing animals for leather, a
smaller 46 percent said that should be illegal. And while 60
percent disapproved of hunting, a considerably smaller 33 percent
said hunting should be illegal.

<TEXT>
   Delegates from 17 nations gathered for a White
House conference on global warming amid criticism Monday from some
participants and environmentalists that the Bush administration
isn't dealing with the problem.
   Senior administration officials said the United States will call
for increased international research on both the science of global
warming and the economic implications of the ``greenhouse'' effect
when the two-day conference begins Tuesday.
   But as delegates arrived, environmentalists chastised President
Bush for not calling for specific actions to ease the global
warming problem, including commitments to make specific reductions
in greenhouse pollutants.
   The Sierra Club, which announced a TV advertising campaign to
highlight concerns about global warming, called the White House
conference an attempt by the administration to shift the focus of
the issue away from the need for pollution controls to a debate
over economic considerations.
   ``It's really a smoke screen for the administration's inaction
on global warming,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club. ``We
know enough now to begin acting on to curb global warming today.''
   Some conference participants also expressed concern about the
heavy U.S. focus on more research.
   ``In spite of remaining uncertainties on some aspects of the
issue, an effective response policy must be established now,
without any further delay,'' said a statement issued on behalf of
the 12 nations attending from the European Community.
   Laurnes Jan Brinkhorst, director-general for the environment of
the European Community's Council of Ministers, and Padraig Flynn,
environmental minister of Ireland, said there was an ``urgent need
for an effective response policy'' while additional research is
under way.
   Senior administration officials have reiterated in recent days
that Bush will offer no new policy proposals to curb the manmade
pollution that scientists agree is causing the earth to warm.
   Bush, in remarks that will open the conference, was expected
instead to focus on the need for additional research to resolve
both scientific uncertainties about global warming and establish
clearer estimates on economic costs.
   The conference, which is being held just days before Sunday's
celebration of Earth Day, fulfills a campaign promise Bush made to
hold an international conference on global warming early in his
presidency.
   Representatives to the meeting are senior cabinet-level advisers
on economics, science and the environment from 17 nations,
including the European community, Japan and Brazil.
   Bush advisers said they hoped the conference would, for the
first time, give equal weight to economic and environmental issues
related to global warming and ``ensure the economics will be
injected ... into all future international forums'' on the subject.
   ``We hope it will raise the level of debate ... on the science
and economics of global change,'' said Michael Boskin, chairman of
the president's Council of Economic Advisers and one of the
conference co-chairmen.
   A number of European countries, including the Netherlands and
West Germany, have advocated that industrial nations commit to a
stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions by 2000 through a variety
of programs reducing energy needs.
   Carbon dioxide, which is produced in the burning of fossil
fuels, is responsible for about half the greenhouse pollutants.
   Environmentalists have argued that a wide range of actions could
be taken to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse pollutants by
requiring the manufacture of more fuel-efficient cars and promoting
energy savings in other ways in homes and businesses.
   The Sierra Club, which has more than 500,000 members, will take
that message to the public with a series of public service ads
featuring actors such as William Shatner, John Ritter and Jane
Alexander.
   The Bush administration has maintained that while there is
widespread agreement that manmade pollutants are causing the earth
to warm, it's not clear how severe the problem will be to warrant
pollution controls that could have widespread economic impact.
   The president's chief science adviser, Allen Bromley, last week
criticized those who advocate ``slam-dunk solutions'' to global
warming.
   ``We cannot sail blindly into the future,'' said Bromley,
another conference co-chairman.
   Some computer models have suggested that manmade pollutants will
cause a 4-degree to 9-degree Fahrenheit increase in global
temperatures in 60 years as the increasing pollution traps heat
close to the Earth.
   However, some scientists said those projections are uncertain
and may not adequately take into account clouds or other factors
that might have a counteracting effect.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Monday it has
given the go-ahead for an Auburn University scientist to conduct
field tests of cabbage and broccoli that have been genetically
engineered to glow.
   Officials said a permit has been issued to Joseph Shaw, an
assistant professor of botany and microbiology, to begin the tests
this month in Macon County, Ala.
   Shaw transferred a set of genes having a code for
bioluminescence from a marine organism into bacteria that causes
black rot, a major disease of plants in the cabbage and broccoli
family.
   After infecting plants with the luminescent black rot bacteria,
the diseased plant parts will glow, allowing scientists to trace
the progress of the disease through the plant.
   One of the benefits of the process will be the observation of
the disease's progress without destroying the plants, Shaw said in
a report released here.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, which issued the permit, said a
review showed the proposed field tests ``will pose no agricultural
or human hazard.''
   In nature, the microorganism _ Vibrio fischeri _ enjoys a
``symbiotic relationship with fish, for which it produces light,''
the agency said. ``Scientists suspect the fish use the glowing
microorganisms to communicate with each other.''

   Dog may be man's best friend, but sometimes
dogs choose other creatures dear _ or deer, as the case may be.
   Richard Faulkner's yellow Labrador, Jake, has taken up with a
chummy young buck that showed up in Faulkner's wooded back yard a
couple of weeks ago, looking hungry and lost.
   Jake, a frisky 3-year-old, made the deer feel at home, sharing
his water bucket and trying to entice the woodland animal into
games.
   ``Jake must think the deer is a dog and the deer must think Jake
is a deer,'' said Faulkner.
   The dog tosses a bone into the air, hoping the deer will get the
idea and play along. The deer watches closely, but doesn't get it,
or just doesn't like that particular game.
   He does occasionally hunker down on the ground nose-to-nose with
Jake, Faulkner said. And when frightened, the deer huddles near
Jake's back-yard dog house for protection.
   ``I can't understand it and I've thought about it quite a bit,
too,'' said Faulkner, 59, who retired Friday from his job as a
night watchman at a quarry.
   ``I think both of them are lonely.''
   The deer follows Faulkner to his garden and lets him get within
5 feet.
   ``I think there's a bond between people and animals,'' he said.
   Faulkner refuses to make a pet of the animal, saying he fears
that the deer could hurt children in his neighborhood. He tried
scaring the buck off recently but it returned.

   A prisoner says he has invented a
device that will prevent the crime that put him behind bars.
   ``It has kept me very busy,'' said Joe Walker, 34. ``I've worked
on this 18 hours a day. I probably never would have done it if I
hadn't been arrested. I never would have had the time. Right now,
all I've got is time.''
   Walker is serving a six-year term in federal prison for
interstate transportation of stolen property, part of what he calls
his ``past minor indiscretions.''
   Walker and engineer Tim Jensen say they have a patent pending on
The Trailer Guard, which they say will stop the theft of truck
trailers.
   Walker said the Trailer Guard makes it impossible for anyone to
connect a truck's ``fifth wheel'' _ the coupling on the rear of the
tractor _ to the trailer's kingpin and haul off the parked trailer.
   In 1987, 177,807 trailers were stolen nationwide at a loss of $8
billion, according to the American Trucking Association.
   Walker said he had to shop around to find an engineer to help
with his invention.
   ``I had called several engineers, but as soon as I told them
where I was calling from they said, `Sorry, can't help you,'''
Walker said.
   Walker, who has 18 months left of his sentence, made his
comments by telephone from the Federal Correctional Institute at
Seagoville, 15 miles southeast of Dallas.
   Walker said after he is released, he would like to stay in the
Dallas area and set up his business.

<TEXT>
   An insurance company has rejected more than
40,000 claims totaling $1.1 million from an agency that provides
services for Alzheimer's patients.
   Nationwide Insurance company said it stopped the Medicare
payments Oct. 1 because recreational and social activities were
part of the therapy provided.
   A group has formed to fight Nationwide's denial of Medicare
payments to Intergenerational Services Inc., a non-profit agency
founded five years ago. The Toledo-based agency said it will have
to close by the end of the month unless the company changes its
position.
   ``Time is short since we're facing a deadline which is less than
three weeks away, but we're determined to gather an impressive
number of signatures,'' said Judith Messinger, chairwoman of
Advocates for Alzheimer's Victims.
   The group was formed Friday to call attention to the fact that
the agency will have to shut if the claims aren't paid and to
gather signatures to show support for their cause.
   Intergenerational provides psychotherapy to Alzheimer's patients
at 66 nursing homes in 15 northwest Ohio counties.
   William P. Ramsey, vice president of Nationwide's Medicare
operation, said in a statement last week, ``As a Medicare carrier
under federal government contract, Nationwide is obligated to
safeguard the proper use of Medicare money.''
   Dr. Alice Faryna, medical director for Nationwide's Medicare
operations, said in the statement certain psychotherapeutic
services that are medically necessary are payable under Medicare.
   However, she also said that a review indicates that some of
Intergenerational's activities do not fit the description of
psychotherapy.
   ``They just feel that these older people don't have much of a
future, and that it's not really worth the money to invest in
making their quality of life a little bit better than it was
before,'' said the Rev. A. Otto Baumann II, agency president.
   The program, which began at the suggestion of a Toledo nursing
home, is designed to help patients become more social and ease
depression, program director Susan Lemle said. It also operates an
Alzheimer's day care center in Toledo.

   King Birendra on Monday asked the
once-banned Nepali Congress Party to form an interim government to
rule until the first free elections in nearly three decades are
held.
   A leader of the party, Ganesh Man Singh, met with Birendra and
said the king indicated he would give up his wide powers. Singh
said after the meeting that parliamentary elections would be held
within a year.
   Birendra approved Krishna Prasad Bhattarai as the new prime
minister pending the vote, Singh said. Bhattarai is acting
president of the Nepali Congress Party.
   The events capped a day of political victories for the Nepali
Congress Party and its ally, the seven-party United Left Front.
They led nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations that began in
February.
   The palace press secretary was not available for comment.
   Earlier Monday, Birendra dissolved the non-partisan national
assembly and announced the resignation of the 10-day-old government
of Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, clearing the way for the
new interim government.
   The concessions followed the king's decision April 8 to lift the
29-year-old ban on political parties in an effort to appease the
pro-democracy movement, which included violent clashes between
protesters and police.
   Bhattarai, 65, told reporters he will present the names of the
members of his government to the king Tuesday.
   A Nepali Congress statement said Birendra first asked Singh to
head the government, but the 75-year-old leader refused, citing ill
health.
   Singh then suggested Bhattarai as the new government leader, and
the United Left Front agreed, the statement said.
   ``His Majesty accepted the suggestion and asked Mr. Singh to
convey his pleasure to Mr. Bhattarai on his nomination,'' said the
statement.
   It added ``Mr. Singh repeatedly emphasised the great benefits
the country shall derive if his majesty very gracefully accepted
the role of a constitutional monarch of a parliamentary democracy.''
   Singh later said Birendra expressed his inclination toward
changing the country to a constitutional monarchy. ``He did not say
in explicit terms but favored the idea,'' Singh said.
   Under the present system all executive, legislative and judicial
powers are in the king's hands.
   Birendra invited Singh to the palace after talks between Chand
and opposition groups on forming an interim government broke down
Sunday.
   The Nepali Congress and the United Left Front, who launched
their movement Feb. 18, demanded multiparty elections, an interim
government headed by an opposition leader, the dissolution of the
national assembly and a new constitution.
   Bhattarai said a commission would draft a new constitution.
   He added, ``I hope in course of our work with the king there
will be no use for his special powers.'' Those powers will remain
in force until a new consitution is framed.
   He said it was unlikely members of the former national assembly
would participate in the new government.
   Bhattarai called his new job ``a very, very challenging task for
which I was not at all mentally prepared. Still I am glad that my
friends and comrades have reposed so much ... confidence in me for
which I am thankful to them all.
   ``I still do not know to what extent I shall be able to do
something for all those who have given their lives for the cause of
democracy,'' he said.
   Bhattarai was the speaker of the Nepalese parliament during the
nation's only previous experience with Western-style democracy from
1959-60.
   Birendra's father, King Mahendra, dissolved the government led
by the Nepali Congress in December 1960, accusing it of corruption
and incompetence. Political parties were banned shortly afterward.
   Thousands of demonstrators stoned Chand's car Sunday afternoon
and wrecked it during the night outside the Royal Nepal Academy of
arts and literature.
   Bhattarai said the new government's first priorities would be
improving the economy and relations with India.
   Landlocked, mountainous Nepal is one of the world's poorest
countries.
   Bhattarai also said his government planned to compensate the
families of those killed by security forces during the seven-week
democracy campaign and reorganize the police force to limit its
powers.
   In a radio broadcast announcing the dissolution of the national
assembly, Birendra said ``in view of the events that have taken
place in certain parts of the country, the people's aspirations and
the ideals of democracy, we have been making political changes.
   ``There should be a congenial atmosphere where every citizen can
enjoy democracy and nobody should be forced to do anything which
can run counter to the expression of freedom.''
   Yog Prasad Upadhyaya, secretary-general of the Nepali Congress,
described Birendra's statement as showing ``progress in the right
direction.''

<TEXT>
   Angolan rebels Monday claimed their
forces killed 78 soldiers, destroyed 92 military vehicles and shot
down two helicopters belonging to the Marxist government in two
days of fighting.
   The heaviest clashes occurred Saturday in the province of Uige,
150 miles northeast of the Angolan capital Luanda, the rebels said
in a statement distributed in Lisbon. They said guerrillas ambushed
a convoy of military vehicles there.
   The U.S.-backed UNITA rebels claimed to have destroyed 70
vehicles and killed 43 government troops in the raid. Two of four
helicopters taking part in the fighting were destroyed by rebel
anti-aircraft fire, said the UNITA statement.
   The Angolan Defense Ministry said a Soviet-built Mi-17
helicopter was downed by the rebels, killing three crew members,
but said another Mi-17 escaped with minor damage.
   UNITA has vowed to step up its activities in northern Angola in
response to the government's advance into its southeastern
territories in December.
   Monday's rebel statement said 35 government soldiers died in
three clashes with UNITA forces on the southern front over Friday
and Saturday.
   Western and Angolan diplomats in Lisbon said Monday no date or
venue had been set for peace talks between UNITA and the government
to end the guerilla conflict, now in its 15th year.
   Unconfirmed reports last week said direct negotiations between
the two sides could start soon in Lisbon. UNITA proposed the
Portuguese capital as a venue for talks, but the government said it
would prefer the West African nation of Cape Verde.
   Both sides have expressed a desire for talks aimed at a
cease-fire and a political solution to the conflict.
   A cease-fire agreed to last summer and tentative peace talks
broke down within weeks.
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has been fighting since the country gained independence from
Portugal in 1975 to force the Cuban and Soviet-backed government to
share power.

   Milk production in the first three months of
1990 was up about 1 percent from the first quarter of last year,
the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The U.S. total was reported at about 36.9 billion pounds in the
first quarter, compared with less than 36.5 billion pounds a year
earlier.
   In the 21 major dairy states, which account for about 85 percent
of the U.S. total, output was reported at 31.3 billion pounds. The
number of cows on farms was shown at 8.51 million head, down 27,000
from a year earlier.
   The average milk output per cow in the 21 states was 1,291
pounds in March, up 23 pounds from March 1989.
   Department analysts forecast U.S. milk production this year may
rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last year's 144.3 billion pounds.
   ``The high milk prices of late 1989 and early 1990 have provided
a financial boost to dairy farmers and a stimulus to production,''
the department's Economic Research Service said.

<HEAD>Work Continues to Empty Religious Group's Leaking Fuel Tanks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORWIN SPRINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The estimated size of a fuel leak
near Yellowstone National Park reached 31,000 gallons Monday, and
the state considered legal action against the sect that owns the
leaking tanks.
   Workers continued to pump out 35 tanks with a capacity of
634,500 gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline that were buried during
the winter by the Church Universal and Triumphant as part of a
750-person fallout shelter complex.
   The sect buried the fuel for use after an unspecified global
catastrophe it believes may occur this spring.
   The complex is five miles north of Yellowstone National Park and
within several hundred yards of Mol Heron Creek, an important
cutthroat trout spawning stream that runs into the Yellowstone
River.
   The estimated size of the spill was increased from 19,000 to
31,000 gallons as a result of more accurate measurements, but
officials hadn't ruled out the possibility that more fuel was
leaking, said Steve Pilcher, chief of the state Water Quality
Bureau.
   Small amounts of fuel that reached the creek Sunday were gone
Monday, and no major damage had occurred, officials said. U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service officials took water samples downstream from
the spill for tests.
   The sect owns about 30,000 acres in southern Montana's Park
County. It has sponsored several housing developments in the rural,
remote area and urged its members to build fallout shelters in
anticipation of a nuclear war or nuclear accident.
   But the church says its concern over nuclear holocaust took
second place to pollution when it discovered last week that three
tanks were leaking.
   ``This is our home; the last thing we want is to have to deal
with an environmental problem,'' said church spokesman Murray
Steinman. Church spiritual leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet ``has
said protecting our ecosystem is more important the our bomb
shelters.''
   State health officials met in Helena to decide whether to seek a
court order to make sure the church carries out its plans to dig up
the 35 tanks and inspect them for leaks, Pilcher said.
   The state may seek an injunction either to guarantee the tanks
are emptied, tested and removed, or to halt construction at the
site, he said.
   State officials also were attempting to determine if the spill
violated the state's water quality and underground storage tank
laws, Pilcher said.
   ``We don't have any idea where that 31,000 gallons of fuel is,''
Pilcher said. ``If we did, we'd know how dangerous our enemy is.
... It could show up anywhere. They're going to have to begin
digging and follow the contaminated soil until they find it, and
either recover it or get rid of it.''
   Pilcher said the tanks may have ruptured because they were
installed in frozen soil that shifted when it began to thaw.
   By being installed during the winter, the tanks are exempt from
new underground tank regulations that took effect April 1.
   Church officials decided over the weekend to pump out the tanks.
   ``After the second and third leaks, we said, `That's it, we're
going to get all this out of here,''' Steinman said.
   He said tanker trucks hauled out 110,000 gallons of gasoline
Sunday, leaving 430,000 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel to be
moved.
   State officials earlier this year reopened an environmental
review of church developments near Corwin Springs, saying the
church concealed construction of the shelter complex during the
original review, completed in March 1989.

<HEAD>Administration Says ``Time is Wasting'' on Nicaragua Aid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration suggested Monday that
delaying action on its Central American aid package beyond
Nicaragua's April 25 inauguration would be an affront to incoming
President Violeta Chamorro.
   ``I have pledged to Mrs. Chamorro that the United States
government would respond in Nicaragua's hour of need,'' said
President Bush, renewing criticism of congressional inaction on his
$800 million aid request for Nicaragua and Panama.
   ``I'm disappointed that Congress failed to take the final steps
to make the funds available before the Easter recess,'' he told a
conference at the White House on Latin-American affairs.
   At the same time, a senior administration said ``it would be a
very unfortunate message for the Congress to send to Mrs. Chamorro
not to have this on the president's desk by her inauguration.''
   ``Time is wasting. To cut this package and reduce it supposedly
to help some other part of the world would be a historic mistake,''
said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity at a
briefing on Tuesday's visit of Honduras President Rafael L.
Callejas.
   The package bogged down in Congress calls for $500 million for
Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua.
   However, the House increased the package to $2.4 billion, adding
money for U.S. projects including food stamps, disaster relief,
fighting forest fires and veterans programs.
   The Senate has yet to act on the legislation. Congress returns
from its recess later this week and the Senate is expected to
quickly take up the Central American aid package.
   Many members have called for expanding the package to include
more aid for emerging Eastern European democracies.
   The administration last week said it would shift some $3.6
million in already appropriated funds as a stopgap measure to help
a joint United Nations-Organization of Americans States team begin
the process of demobilizing Contra rebels. Many of the rebels are
in camps in Honduras.
   But the senior administration official said, ``There are some
45,000 family members of the resistance who will remain in Honduras
as refugees. They want to go home.''
   Bush's $300 million request for Nicaragua includes $47 million
for refugees and resistanze members and families.
   ``If that money is not available, the ability of the Central
Americans and Mrs. Chamorro to help this process move along is
going to be crippled. It would burden Honduras with a burden it
should not have at this time. They've been very patient for many
years,'' the official said.
   Bush told his audience that Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration ``will
close a painful chapter in (Nicargua's) history and begin a new
story _ a new life in democracy.''
   ``I believe the United States of America has a great deal at
stake in the success of Violeta Chamorro, but more so in democracy
itself in Nicaragua,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Administration Pondering Sweeping Changes in Banking System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration is examining ideas for
broad changes in the banking system, but is months away from
deciding on specific proposals, officials said Monday.
   The Treasury Department has expanded an ongoing study of federal
deposit insurance to include a look at restructuring the regulatory
bureaucracy and at mixing commercial banking with the insurance and
securities industries, officials said.
   Savings and loan legislation enacted last August requires
Treasury to complete the deposit insurance study by February. It is
focused on ways to limit taxpayers' liability for the insurance and
on removing incentives from the system that encourage unwarranted
risk-taking by insured institutions.
   Administration officials also have long discussed modernizing
the financial system by relaxing the restrictions that have
separated commercial banking from the securities business since
enactment of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act.
   The effort, which is being combined with the deposit insurance
study, has been intensified by the prospect of increased
competition from foreign institutions after the economic
unification of Europe in 1992.
   The administration also is reviewing a recent congressional
report that predicted the savings and loan bailout will fall short,
requiring billions of dollars more from taxpayers.
   ``The Treasury Department is ... broadening (the study) to
consider other problems in the financial industry. The savings and
loan situation certainly demands attention,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Monday. ``I think it's fair to say that
Treasury is looking at the broad regulatory aspects of banking.''
   Officials denied, however, that the administration was settling
on a number of controversial proposals reported in Monday's
editions of The Washington Post. Among them were:
   _Cutting the $100,000-per-account deposit insurance in half and
limiting depositors to one insured account.
   _Merging the banking and S&amp;L industries and eliminating the
Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   _Combining the insurance funds for banks and thrift
institutions, thereby forcing banks to help pay for the S&amp;L bailout.
   ``We don't have any conclusions at the moment. (The study) is
certainly a long way from being completed,'' Fitzwater said.
   Treasury spokeswoman Desiree Tucker-Sorini said the deposit
insurance review is in its early stages and the administration has
no preconceived ideas about how the system should be changed.
   She said the administration last year rejected merging the bank
and S&amp;L insurance funds and ``we have no proposal'' to do that now.
   ``At this time, we don't see any reason'' to abolish the thrift
office, she added.
   But she also said that the department hasn't rejected any ideas
either, only that the administration believes this year is too soon
after passage of the S&amp;L law to act on major banking legislation.
   ``For next year, who knows? At this point, it's way too early to
determine,'' she said.
   Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson, in a private speech
earlier this month to the Independent Bankers Association of
America, revealed that the department had widened the scope of its
approach.
   ``The Treasury study is not going to focus on deposit insurance
in a vacuum,'' Robson said. ``We are taking a comprehensive
approach, including consideration of ... the financial activities
in which institutions engage and the regulatory structure.''
   Lobbing groups objected strongly to some of the ideas floated in
the Post's story.
   ``Floating a proposal to cut back existing levels of deposit
insurance is unfortunate,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice
president of the Independent Bankers Association of America. ``It
further weakens confidence in the financial industry and, if
implemented, would further weaken the thrift industry and
consequently increase the cost of the S&amp;L bailout.''
   Robert Dugger, chief economist of the American Bankers
Association, said merging the bank and S&amp;L insurance funds would
raise public concerns about bank safety.
   ``It's a formula for ... financial disaster,'' he said. ``You
can't burden the bank insurance fund with the thrift crisis. It's
not designed for that and would collapse under the weight.''

<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday banned eight
militant Moslem organizations in Kashmir and closed two local
newspapers in its latest effort to contain unrest in the disputed
territory.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said one of the
organizations outlawed was the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
which is leading the bloody independence campaign in the northern
area bordering Pakistan.
   The two newspapers closed are in Srinagar, Kashmir's main city
and the center of the separatist campaign.
   A government statement said the Urdu language newspapers, Aftab
and Alsafa, had published materials to incite the public.
   Earlier Monday, witnesses accused Indian soldiers of brutalizing
suspected militants during house-to-house searches. At least 33
people were arrested. The searches came on the 10th day of a
24-hour curfew that has restricted civilians to their homes.
   In one district, troops were seen forcing a group of men to
perform squats _ a knee-bend exercise _ with heavy stones on their
backs.
   ``None of them are militants,'' said one witness. ``But this
will make them militants. We thought the Indian army was
disciplined, but we were wrong.''
   He and other witnesses, all of whom spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they were too far away to know what provoked the
action.
   The government imposed a round-the-clock curfew April 6 after
three people were kidnapped by Moslem militants, whose seek
secession of the Kashmir valley from Hindu-dominated India. All
three hostages were shot to death when the government failed to
respond to the kidnappers' demands of freedom for three jailed
comrades.
   Since then, residential areas of Srinagar, at the far northern
tip of India, have been under constant curfew as troops fan out to
search for suspects.
   On Monday, the government announced a two-hour relaxation of
curfew in the Civil Lines shopping district. Witnesses said most
shops in Civil Lines did not open because the shop owners live in
downtown Srinagar, where curfew was not lifted.
   The insurgency in the Kashmir valley has claimed at least 270
lives since the government cracked down on the Moslem movement on
Jan. 20. Most of the victims have died in confrontations between
security forces and the militants.
   The independence movement has also escalated tensions between
India and Pakistan, which have fought two wars over the valley
since both counties gained independence from Britain in 1947.
   The Hindu ruler of the Moslem-dominated Kashmir province opted
to join India, although other Moslem-majority provinces went to
Islamic Pakistan.
   A Moslem secession movement has grown in recent years because of
complaints the region was being ignored by New Delhi.
   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the insurgency, an
accusation Pakistan denies.

   Local, federal and Mexican officials on
Monday searched for a suspected leader of a multimillion-dollar
drug ring and two other inmates who pulled a gun on a guard and
escaped from a privately operated jail.
   The three cellmates at the Central Texas Parole Violators
Facility fled late Sunday on foot.
   One of the three lured a guard to the cell by pretending to be
sick, then pulled a .25-caliber handgun, said U.S. Marshal Bill
Jonas. The three inmates then locked up two guards in a closet and
overpowered another before seizing the security control panels and
opening a door, Jonas said.
   Officials of Wackenhut Corp., which operates the supplementary
jail under contract with Bexar County to alleviate jail crowding,
speculate the pistol was smuggled inside during visiting hours
Sunday, said Pat Cannan, spokesman for the Coral Gables, Fla.,
company.
   Visitors are screened at the prison, across the street from
police headquarters, but Cannan would not give details of the
process.
   The escapees were identified as Mario Alberto Salinas Trevino,
Charlie Edward Compton and Juan Chapa Garza.
   Salinas, 37, led one of the largest drug-smuggling and
money-laundering rings between Texas and Mexico, authorities said.
He was among 25 people arrested last year in ``Operation Jet Set,''
a series of raids by federal authorities in California and Texas.
   Authorities seized $10 million from Salinas when he was
arrested. He's also suspected of having up to $10 million in drug
money stashed in Texas or Mexico, Jonas said.
   Law enforcement authorities suspect Salinas would go to Mexico,
about 150 miles away.
   ``That's a logical escape route,'' said Jonas. ``If that's the
case, I think he's acting ill-advisedly. I have every reason to
believe the Mexican government will cooperate with us.''
   Salinas allegedly led a drug ring with Ramiro Mirales Felix of
Guadalajara, Mexico, federal prosecutors said when Salinas was
arrested.
   Officials allege the ring transported more than 46,000 pounds of
marijuana, 1,900 pounds of cocaine and made financial transactions
or purchases in excess of $7.6 million. The ring allegedly
distributed the drugs in Texas, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois,
Florida and Massachusetts.
   Indictments alleged the ring used banks in San Antonio and Roma,
Texas, and San Ysidro, Calif., to launder the narcotics profits.
   Compton was awaiting trial on possession of cocaine with intent
to distribute charges. Chapa was charged with possession of
marijuana with intent to distribute.
   The fugitives' cases were not connected, Jonas said, but added:
``I would think that the three of them would stay together for
awhile.''

<TEXT>
   A juvenile facing a possible death sentence in
Alabama lost his final court battle to avoid extradition Monday
when the Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal.
   The 17-year-old boy, identified in court proceedings only by the
initials O.M., is charged with arson and murder in the May 1988
death of 14-month-old Tamal Jackson, who was killed when a firebomb
exploded inside an apartment at a Gadsden, Ala., housing project.
   O.M. has been fighting extradition since his arrest by District
of Columbia authorities in December 1988. His battle has attracted
widespread attention because of its focus on capital punishment for
juveniles and Southern justice for blacks.
   James A. Hedgspeth, district attorney for Etowah County, Ala.,
said the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case removes the last
legal obstacle to the youth's return to Alabama to face the
juvenile petition charging him with arson and murder.
   The Etowah County District Court will determine whether O.M.
will be certified to stand trial as an adult, a move that could
subject him to the death penalty if convicted.
   O.M.'s lawyers argued unsuccessfully in Washington courts that
his extradition would violate the district government's ban on
capital punishment.
   They also contended that O.M., who is black, could not get a
fair trial from the predominantly white judicial system in Etowah
County, where both his father and another relative died in police
custody.
   Two of O.M.'s uncles, 32-year-old Yul Devoe Guice and an
18-year-old identified only by the initials S.T., also were charged
with arson and murder in the death of the Jackson infant.
   S.T. was arrested by District of Columbia authorities last
summer and has also been fighting extradition to Alabama.

   Thousands of children frolicked on the White
House lawn Monday, hunting wooden eggs and rolling real ones in a
rite of spring that converted the presidential estate into a
playground.
   President Bush joined briefly in the fun, blowing a shiny
whistle to start an Easter Egg Roll in which his 3-year-old
granddaughter, Marshall Bush, was entered.
   Seven-year-old Michael Angel of Fairfax, Va., was unabashed at
the competition.
   While the others nudged, poked or putted their eggs along with
plastic spoons, Michael ran away from the field with his egg firmly
esconced in spoon.
   ``He's pretty cool,'' Michael said about Bush.
   Mia Angel, Michael's 5-year-old sister, said the president was
fun, but ``he didn't shake my hand.''
   Actually, there were no winners or losers in the 10-yard races.
All comers got wooden eggs bearing the names of George and Barbara
Bush.
   The same prizes were to be found without too much scrutiny under
hay strewn about in pens elsewhere on the lawn.
   Some eggs bore real signatures from the likes of Michael Jackson
and other famous White House visitors.
   At day's end, Debra Romash, director of the White House Visitors
Office, reported that 23,250 people came through the gates, up from
about 22,000 last year.
   The wait for some families to get in was hours; others, like the
four children that Frankie Mason brought from a shelter in nearby
Alexandria, Va., had special passes that let them right in.
   ``C'mon,'' said Ms. Mason, lining up her charges for pictures in
front of a billboard-sized Easter egg. ``We need to know that we
were here.''
   Vin and Paula Paolino came from Boston with sons David, 6, and
James, 3. They arrived on the Ellipse at 10:15 a.m.; at 12:38 p.m.,
they were still in line, 50 yards _ and another 20 minutes _ from
the White House gate.
   They had no complaints.
   ``I've been telling all my patients about this for three months.
Everybody's been cheering us on,'' said Vin Paolino, a dentist.
   Eric Valdes, a spindly 7-year-old from Wheaton, Md., displayed
unusual strength at the Easter Egg Roll. He gave one powerful swipe
that lofted his egg across the finish line _ and onto the head of
Margaret Hedger, intent on taking a picture of her own child in the
same race.
   The young mother from Stafford, Va., was not hurt, but said she
would ``probably not'' be back next year.
   The lawn teemed with clowns, minstrels, an Abe Lincoln
look-alike, balloon-blowers, dancers, bands, a yo-yo master, and
other entertainers, including puppeteer Shari Lewis.
   ``I want to get my face painted,'' said 9-year-old Chad Hampton
of Herndon, Va., who came with his sister, mother and other
friends. ``I got lucky. I got a balloon.''
   ``We got up at 6 a.m. We left at 7 and were down here at 8:15,''
said his mother, Margie Hampton, who took the morning off from work
as a medical social worker.
   ``Don't ask me if it's worth it. But what we do for kids!''
   Thousands got Virginia pine seedlings, including Beverly
Johnson, who brought 11 youngsters from a local day-care center she
runs.
   ``We'll plant it right in the (center's) front yard,'' said
Damares Blondonville, her assistant.
   All the children got canvas sacks crammed with books,
suggestions for celebrating Earth Day and other souvenirs.

<HEAD>Singapore Leader Says Bush to Retain Asian Presence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President George Bush assured Singapore's
probable next government chief Monday that the United States
intends to maintain a strong military presence in the Western
Pacific, said the visitor, First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong.
   ``We support that,'' Goh told reporters after a half-hour White
House meeting with Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and other U.S. leaders.
   ``Don't give up your influence in the area'' under fiscal
pressure, added Goh, named by longtime Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
three years ago as Lee's eventual successor as head of the
Singapore government and ruling Peoples Action Party.
   The United States has invested many years building influence in
the Western Pacific and it would be wrong to abandon it just as
countries in the area such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
South Korea are taking off economically, he said.
   Goh also urged U.S. steadfastness in backing the policy of
Singapore and other members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, toward seeking a comprehensive solution for
Cambodia, devastated by years of civil war.
   ``The question is, do we now become suddenly exhausted and hand
the game to the Vietnamese-backed Hun Seng government, or to the
Khmer Rouge, or do we try ... to ensure that the non-communist
resistance has a chance to win in a fair elections which may be
held under United Nations supervision?'' he said.
   U.S. officials have been reported reassessing U.S. Cambodian
policy to break a deadlock among the Cambodian factions that
critics say threatens a return to power of the Khmer Rouge, blamed
for more than a million Cambodian deaths in the 1970s.
   Singapore has said U.S. forces could use some of its facilities
if the United States and the Philippines fail to agree on future
terms for American bases in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
   A striking bus driver was arrested Monday
on federal charges in the shooting of a Greyhound bus last month, a
prosecutor said.
   In Falksville, Ala. a Greyhound bus was fired on as it travelled
from Nashville, Tenn., to Birmingham, Ala., said company
spokeswoman Ann Wheat. The shot missed, and there were no injuries.
   In Kansas City, maintenence workers found a bullet embedded in
the radiator of a bus that arrived from St. Louis, Ms. Wheat said.
   Dennis L. Daniels, a Greyhound driver for 10 years, was arrested
at his Columbus home and was being held without bond pending a bail
hearing, said U.S. Attorney D. Michael Crites.
   A federal grand jury Friday charged Daniels, 42, with damaging
the bus in reckless disregard for the safety of passengers and
using a firearm in damaging the bus.
   The bus, en route from Columbus to Cincinnati, was hit by three
shots fired from a car early March 9 on Interstate 71 about 25
miles southwest of Columbus. There were no injuries to either the
29 passengers or the bus' replacement driver.
   ``We are very happy an arrest has been made,'' said Greyhound
spokesman George Gravley. ``We are obviously pleased that federal
agencies have become involved in the shootings.
   ``Our overall interest is getting the violence stopped,''
Gravley said. ``If more arrests are made, it may be effective in
preventing further violence.''
   Daniels was the fourth person arrested since Greyhound's 6,300
drivers and 3,000 maintenence and office workers walked out March 2
in a dispute over wages and job security. One person was arrested
in Connecticut and two in St. Louis.
   Gravley said there have been 31 shooting attacks involving
Greyound and seven injuries since the strike began.
   He said the company won't negotiate with striking drivers and
other employees until a week goes by without incident.
   The striking employees' union said the seven-day standard means
any criminal can hold up negotiating talks.
   ``Ninety-three hundred employees are being held hostage by
common criminals,'' said Jeff Nelson, spokesman for the Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions in Washington.
   Nelson said company officials ``have a legal obligation to
negotiate and they're hiding from that legal obligation by using
violence as a smokescreen.'' ``First of all, until proven guilty,
the gentleman is innocent,'' he said. ``But we continue to stand by
our previous statment, that anyone involved in violence should be
brought to justice, no matter who he is.''

Monday at his home. He was 81.
   Ramage was the first living submariner to receive the Medal of

convoy off Formosa on July 31, 1944.
   A 1931 graduate of the Naval Academy, Ramage took over his first
command _ the USS Trout _ in 1942. The Trout engaged in successful
patrols near Midway and the Truk Islands and in the South China Sea.
   Later in 1942, he was promoted to commander and the next year
took over command of the USS Parche.
   After retiring from the Navy, Ramage was active in consulting
and community service work.
   Survivors include his wife, four children, two brothers, eight
grandchildren and a great-grandson.

<TEXT>
   Friends and relatives of hostage John
McCarthy sent messages to Beirut newspapers and television stations
asking for his freedom as the British journalist marked his fourth
year in captivity Monday.
   There is no word on McCarthy's welfare and no group has claimed
responsibility for his kidnapping.
   ``We think constantly of the long years you have spent in Beirut
and hope that 1990 will see you safely back home,'' McCarthy's
father, Patrick, wrote in a message.
   McCarthy's girlfriend, Jill Morrell, wrote: ```No one has
forgotten you for a second. I long to know how you are and what you
are thinking, but the longer this goes on the more determined I am
to see you back home. Hang on and do not lose hope.''
   Several newspapers, radio and television stations in Beirut are
planning to broadcast or print the messages that friends and
relatives hope McCarthy will be permitted to hear or read.
   McCarthy, 33, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, while driving to
Beirut airport to catch a flight to London. He was working for the
London-based Worldwide Television News.
   In London, a noon church service and a silent vigil outside the
Iranian Embassy were planned to mark his abduction.
   Despite repeated appeals from his family, published in Beirut
newspapers, little is known about McCarthy's kidnappers.
   McCarthy's mother, Sheila, died of cancer at age 66 on July 9,
1989. A month before her death she appealed to her son's abductors
to let her see him before she passed away. She received no response
and it is unclear if McCarthy is aware of his mother's death.
   Appeals from the British government, the International
Federation of Journalists and the United Nations Education,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) have also failed to
draw any response from the kidnappers.
   Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, spiritual head of Lebanon's
Shiite Moslem community, said recently that all Western hostages
kidnapped in Beirut were alive and well. He did not expand on the
statement.
   Shiite extremists loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the
18 Western hostages in Lebanon. Most have been captives for more
than three years.
   Longest-held is American journalist Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   The 18 hostages include eight Americans, four Britons, two
Swiss, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.

<HEAD>NRC Approves Texas' 2nd Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted an
operating license Monday to the Comanche Peak, Texas, nuclear power
plant.
   The five-member commission approved the license for the plant,
the second in the state, after a last-minute claim from opponents
that evacuation plans do not account for the area's higher summer
population.
   Opponents organized as Citizens for Fair Utility Regulation
complained that TU Electric Co., the plant's owner, has failed to
adequately warn residents living near the plant, 80 miles southwest
of Dallas, about evacuation plans. The activists complained
particularly about the added summer population of children
attending church camps.
   Another activist group, Citizens Association for Sound Energy,
had sought a licensing condition to assure a more ``disciplined,
accountable approach'' to resolving operational incidents.
   But the NRC staff recommended said such a condition was not
called for.
   Utility spokeswoman Kathi Miller said the company, which is
seeking a 10.2 percent rate increase in part to recover the costs
of building the $9.1 billion plant, could reach full power by this
summer. The plant is a decade behind schedule and billions of
dollars over budget.
   The utility's 2.1 million customers, who live across the
northern third of the state, could begin receiving electricity from
Comanche Peak 15 years after construction began in 1975 at Glen
Rose.
   Comanche Peak would be the second, and likely the last, plant
this year to receive a full-power operating license from the NRC,
NRC spokesman Frank Ingram said. The commission last month awarded
the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire a
full-power license.
   Texas' other nuclear power plant is the South Texas Project near
Bay City.

   The Bush administration is allowing South
African iron and steel into the United States despite a 1986
economic sanction designed to force an end to apartheid, the State
Department said Monday.
   Most of the controversial imports are ferroalloys, strategic
commodities never intended by Congress to be banned under the law,
said department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler.
   The administration's definition of steel was upheld in a federal
court in 1987 and certain prefabricated products that contain steel
are not included in the definition of steel, she said.
   ``This administration will continue to enforce fully all
provisions of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said. ``This is an old issue that has been thoroughly reviewed by
the Treasury Department.''
   Another U.S. official, requesting anonymity, said some
prefabricated items, such as toasters and some ferroalloys had been
imported. The official said the volume of imports was not readily
available.
   The New York Times, quoting Commerce Department officials,
reported Saturday that more than 900,000 tons of South African iron
and steel products worth at least $350 million had entered the
United States despite the sanctions.
   ``Nothwithstanding any other provision of law, no iron or steel
produced in South Africa may be imported into the United States,''
the law says.
   The Times said Treasury Department lawyers had defined ``steel''
to exclude fabricated steel products such as girders, beams and
plates used in the construction of bridges.
   However, Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, took issue with the
interpretation.
   ``There is no excuse for the administration to allow even one
ounce, much less billions of pounds, of such products to enter the
United States,'' Bryant told the Times.
   A Treasury Department official told The Associated Press on
Monday that ferroalloys were always outside the scope of the law
and that the department intended to screen out prefabricated
products containing steel.
   But, the official said, the appeals court for the court of
international trade, ruled against the department. The official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said such imports were ``very
minor,'' about 1 percent of the volume of ferroalloys.
   ``Our enforcement is very strict,'' the official said. ``There
is no reason for alarm.''
   The law, passed by Congress over President Reagan's veto, also
prohibits new lending and investment, bans flights to and from
South Africa and prohibits American imports of South African coal,
textiles, uranium, farm products and gold coins.
   The Reagan administration called repeatedly for an end to racial
segregation in South Africa. However, it opposed sanctions, saying
blacks would suffer if the country's economy were hurt.

   The man accused of being the ringleader in a
racial slaying carried a pistol and bragged that he was going to
shoot blacks, the prosecution said Monday at the start of his
murder trial.
   ``Keith Mondello was going to murder a black man,'' Assistant
District Attorney James Kohler said. ``It didn't matter what black
man. Yusuf Hawkins innocently appeared on the scene, and his fate
was sealed.''
   Mondello ``boasted that he would blow the heads off the nigger
bastards,'' the prosecutor said.
   A state Supreme Court jury began hearing the case against
Mondello nearly eight months after 16-year-old Hawkins and three of
his pals crossed paths with a mob of bat-wielding whites in the
mostly white Bensonhurst section of the borough of Brooklyn.
   Prosecutors say Mondello _ charged with two counts of
second-degree murder and other crimes _ did not shoot Hawkins, but
created the circumstances that caused his death by assembling the
white gang.
   A second jury in the same courtroom was to hear opening
statements in the trial of the accused gunman, Joseph Fama.
However, those proceedings were postponed until Tuesday because
defense lawyer David DePetris had the flu.
   Mondello and Fama, both 19 years old and charged with two counts
of second-degree murder, would face 25 years to life in prison if
convicted.
   Kohler charged the slaying was a racial murder motivated by
Mondello's hatred of blacks and Hispanics.
   ``To call it anything else but a race riot would demean and
trivialize the death of Yusuf Hawkins,'' Kohler said.
   He added: ``The person who will put many of the pieces to the
puzzle together is the defendant himself.''
   In statements Mondello made to the police following his arrest,
he admitted assembling the gang, admitted having a gun in his car
and said he was carrying a bat at the time of the attack, the
prosecutor said.
   Mondello's lawyer, Stephen Murphy, disputed prosecutors'
accounts of the killing and asserted his client was being falsely
accused by Gina Feliciano, a key prosecution witness he described
as a habitual liar and an unreformed drug addict.
   Murphy said he would play for the jury a recorded conversation
between Miss Feliciano and her sister that ``makes it real clear
that the truth has nothing to do with anything.''
   Murphy charges that the girl brought on the entire episode by
inviting some black and Hispanic friends to an Aug. 23 birthday
party in the mostly Italian-American neighborhood.
   Murphy asserted that Mondello was ``horrified'' by the shooting.
   Six other young whites also were indicted in the killing and
will be tried later.

   Military families are used to being
moved around, but the latest marching orders for 1,200 families
arrived in the form of an eviction notice.
   In a cost-cutting move, the families of mostly low-paid military
recruiters and support staff have been told they must leave their
cozy Army-owned ranch houses near obsolete Nike missile bases by
Aug. 15. A few have until 1993 to find new homes.
   ``We don't know where we're going to go,'' said Cynthia Aitken,
whose New Britain home is in a cluster of 16 Army houses that are
being sold off.
   The houses once were occupied by the families of Nike
anti-aircraft missile crews who had to live nearby so they could
rush to their battle stations in the event of war.
   The missiles were phased out two decades ago, and the housing
passed on to younger generations of military families, many of them
in the Army but with some from the other branches of the armed
forces.
   Two years ago, Congress ordered the Army to close or reorganize
86 installations. As part of that order, the Army must sell 53
housing complexes near former Nike bases.
   The housing is concentrated in the Northeast, with 239 families
in Connecticut, 163 in New York, 104 in New Jersey, 124 in
Massachusetts, 133 in Pennsylvania and 78 families in Rhode Island.
There also are 12 houses in Maryland, 94 in St. Louis, 32 in
Virginia, 110 in Wisconsin, 24 in Illinois and 60 in Washington
state.
   The closings will save the Army about $2 million in maintenance
and utility costs in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island
this year alone, said Helen Mulligan, a spokesman for Fort Devens
in Ayer, Mass.
   Until the closings were announced, Mrs. Aitken did not have to
worry about housing costs because her family was allowed to live
rent-free. Her husband, Bruce, a first-class petty officer and
13-year Navy veteran works at the Plainville Reserve Center.
   She and others like her are worried about how they will rent or
buy homes on annual salaries that in some cases can amount to less
than $15,000. When they leave their free, Army-owned housing, the
families can expect housing allowances in the range of $600 a
month, depending on rank and where they live.
   The issue is particularly sensitive for military families in New
England, where housing costs are among the nation's highest.
   ``That $600 isn't going to buy anything except in neighborhoods
dogs shouldn't be forced to live in,'' said Patricia Berkley, one
of more than 100 military spouses who gathered at the Army Reserve
Training Center in West Hartford last month to express their
frustration to military officials.
   ``How do you expect my husband to be all he can be while he's
worried about his wife and children getting mugged?''
   Roberto Ramos, a Coast Guard officer who lives in Middletown,
says the Army should have given families who live in the houses the
first chance to rent or buy them.
   ``A lot of these guys are young with young kids,'' said Ramos.
``If you put them out in this economy, they're going to be poor
people.''
   Under the law, the Army had to offer the housing to other
service branches and federal agencies first. Houses the federal
government doesn't want will be offered to state agencies, and any
remaining will be offered for sale to the public.
   Ramos said he is among the more fortunate because the Navy is
considering moving him to another rent-free home. In Connecticut,
60 units owned by the Coast Guard and Navy will be preserved for
military families.
   The Army is holding meetings around the country for families who
are losing their homes, and is considering giving some of them
loans or advances, said Joseph Carter, a spokesman for U.S. Forces
Command at Fort McPherson, Ga.
   Beyond that, the Army says there's much else it can do.
   ``It's not a case of us saying we want to get rid of our real
estate and we don't care about housing our people,'' Carter said.
``Congress made the decision.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in an annual
report on the defense spending of NATO nations and Japan, faulted
Luxembourg, Denmark and Canada on Monday for ``below par''
contributions to the common defense.
   ``These nations have, by and large, relatively prosperous
economies and relatively high standards of living, yet devote
relatively small proportions of their resources to defense,'' said
the report, released at the Pentagon.
   ``The performance of this group of nations ... looks
substantially below par,'' it said.
   However, the report noted Canada has had a ``relatively good
performance'' in increasing defense spending in recent years,
Luxembourg is an important host to Allied forces, and Denmark has a
``better than average'' showing in other areas, such as in its
active and reserve troop numbers in relation to the nation's
population.
   The annual Report on Allied Contributions to the Common Defense
is required by Congress, which has become sensitive in recent years
to the high defense contributions the United States makes to
economically robust nations in Western Europe and the Far East.
   The report said that with revolutionary changes sweeping Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, ``the need for defense, arms control,
and burdensharing objectives to remain in harmony is crucial.''
   ``Within NATO a stronger European pillar is evolving.
Adjustments in the roles and responsibilities for the common
defense will contribute to this evolution,'' the report said.
   Overall, the report said, the NATO nations and Japan spent about
$489 billion on defense in 1988, the last year for which common
figures were available.
   ``The United States accounted for $293 billion, or 60 percent of
that amount,'' the report said.
   The other major spenders included: France, $36.1 billion, 7.4
percent; West Germany $35.1 billion, 7.2 percent; Britain, $34.7
billion, 7.1 percent; Japan, $28.9 billion, 5.9 percent; Canada,
$10 billion, 2 percent; Italy $20.4 billion, 4.2 percent; and
others, $30.7 billion, 6.3 percent, the report said.
   Besides assessing the amount spent on defense by each nation,
the report also attempts to look at such things as weaponry and the
number of each nation's active duty and reserve forces in relation
to its population.
   But the report said some things are much harder to measure, such
as the loss of real estate given over in order to Allied troops on
a nation's soil.
   Nations such as Japan and West Germany are sensitive to such
matters, and the report said the market value of such property in
West Germany alone ``has been estimated at $24 billion.''
   The report lauded the so-called ``burdensharing'' efforts of
Turkey, Greece, Britain and France, saying they all allocated
relatively high proportions of their national income to defense.
Turkey and Greece _ nations often at odds with each other _ have
made such contributions even though they enjoy a rather low
economic prosperity, the report noted.
   The nations that have made ``mixed efforts'' included Norway,
West Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Belgium and Spain,
the report said.
   Germany, Norway and the Netherlands ``comprise an upper echelon
of nations who are making good to excellent force improvement
efforts and strong contributions in a number of areas,'' but are
lagging somewhat in the defense spending arena, said the report.
   ``Portugal's relatively modest efforts appear genuinely
equitable when its poor economic situation is taken into account,''
and Italy is ``making major efforts to improve'' despite a low
financial contribution, the report said.
   The report said if Japan's defense spending were measured only
against its high standard of living and economic output, it would
also be judged ``substantially below par.'' But the report noted
Japan's contribution of 1 percent of its so-called gross domestic
output to defense puts it among the top five nations in total
defense spending.
   ``Of greater relevance, Japan is making rapid progress towards
the military capability to fulfill its agreed-upon mission ... the
defense of its territory'' and its sea-lanes to a distance of 1,000
miles, the report said.
   Japan and Okinawa host nearly 50,000 U.S. troops and Japan
contributed nearly $2.2 billion in support for U.S. forces in 1989,
including $685 million for military construction and $410 million
in labor cost sharing, the report said.

   President Bush announced his selection Monday
of Charles H. Thomas, a career foreign service officer, to be U.S.
ambassador to Hungary.
   Thomas, 55, most recently served as principal deputy assistant
secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs. For almost a
year he has been studying Hungarian in preparation for his new
assignment.
   If confirmed by the Senate, he would replaced Mark Palmer, who
recently retired from the foreign service for a job in
international banking.
   U.S. relations with Hungary have improved steadily since that
nation held democratic elections last year. Earlier this month, the
United States entered into a pact with Hungary that extends to the
Warsaw Pact most-favored-nation trade status.
   Thomas is a former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy
in Brussels and director of the Peace Corps in Uruguay and Honduras.
   The White House also announced these appointments:
   _Florida Lt. Gov. Bobby Lynn Brantley of Tallahassee to be a
member of the National Commission on Agriculture and Rural
Development Policy, succeeding Arthur R. Brown.
   _Philip Larson of Reston, Va., a career diplomat, to be U.S.
representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. He succeed Denis Lamb.
   _Gerald William Ebker of Potomac, Md., an IBM Corp. vice
president, as a member of the president's National Security
Telecommunications Advisory Committee.

<TEXT>
   Chief officer Oddvar Finstad of the
Scandinavian Star conceded at a marine inquiry on Monday that he
and other officers abandoned the blazing ferry while passengers
awaited rescue.
   Police in Oslo, Norway, estimated 161 people died in the April 7
fire, but said the figure was not final because it was still
uncertain how many passengers boarded the ferry. The Danish-owned
vessel was on an overnight run from Oslo to Frederikshavn, Denmark.
   Finstad, the third-in-command, said he; Capt. Hugo Larsen, the
Norwegian master of the Scandinavian Star; and other officers left
the burning vessel in a lifeboat, knowing passengers remained on
the deck.
   The fate of the abandoned passengers, some of whom were rescued
later, was not discussed as they rowed away in the last usable
lifeboat, Finstad said.
   ``I can't see what more I could have done on board after the
captain left the ship,'' he said.
   Larsen and other officers returned three hours later to help
Swedish and Norwegian firefighters.
   Larsen testified as the first witness in the inquiry and said he
abandoned ship while some passengers remained alive on board.
   Finstad's testimony on the sixth day of the inquiry supported
accounts by rescued passengers that the crew appeared confused and
ill-trained to deal with an emergency.
   Under questioning, Finstad acknowledged he knew practically
nothing about the ship's emergency plan or evacuation procedures;
that he was unaware of his assignment in the posted emergency plan
as head of the ship's 14-member fire squad, and was unable to
identify the other squad members.
   The inquiry established that the required fire and evacuation
drills were not held.
   Finstad was asked why safety procedures were not checked before
the 20-year-old ferry was allowed to sail with passengers.
   ``We had been on board such a short time that we hadn't gotten
around to it,'' he replied.
   Most of the predominantly Portuguese and Filipino crew signed on
the Scandinavian Star five days before the fire, which police
believe was deliberately set.
   The ship's safety officer, First Officer Sverre Aashildrods,
testified he knew nothing about international safety regulations
that require fire drills when more than 25 percent of the crew is
new.
   The Scandinavian Star's alarm systems had not been checked, and
passengers coming on board did not receive the required safety
cards telling them what to do in an emergency, the inquiry was told.
   The panel is headed by five judges and includes Norwegian and
Danish police, three Scandinavian maritime authorities and lawyers
for the shipowner and the insurance companies concerned.
   The judge leading the inquiry is Frank Poulsen, president of the
Marine and Trade Court. He said the inquiry came at the request of
the shipowner, VR Da-No Lines.
   Criminal charges cannot arise from the inquiry, but witnesses
testify under oath and are warned their testimony could be used in
any subsequent criminal case.
   A joint commission of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish maritime
officials is to hold hearings on the case follow the Copenhagen
inquiry.

   A surge of colder air brought snow and rain to the northern and
central Plains and the upper Midwest on Monday, and parts of dry
California received welcome rain.
   Light rain and wet snow extended across northern and central
Wyoming, and about an inch of snow fell across North Dakota from
late Sunday into early Monday. A mixture of rain and snow fell
across the northern third of South Dakota and northern Minnesota
during the early morning.
   Overnight snowfall in Minnesota included 3 inches north of
Duluth and 2 inches at Morris.
   By noon, the cold front marking the boundary of the cold
temperatures reached across central Upper Michigan, north-central
Missouri, southwestern Kansas, southeastern Colorado and
north-central Montana.
   The temperature in Sioux City, Iowa, dropped 7 degrees in seven
minutes as the cold front passed, and temperatures dropped as much
as 10 degrees across Colorado.
   At midday, snow showers continued over eastern Colorado, western
Nebraska, eastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan.
   Temperatures in Nebraska were slightly higher than freezing, so
snow didn't accumulate. But wind along the cold front gusted to
about 45 mph at Broken Bow, Ord and North Platte.
   Rain extended from Iowa to southeastern Nebraska and
northwestern Missouri, and showers and thunderstorms were scattered
over northeastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri.
   During the early monring, spring rain moved into southern
California, where some communities have restricted water use
because of a lengthy drought. The rain was expected to continue
through Tuesday, with snow at higher elevations.
   Up to a half-inch of rain fell in the mountains northwest of
Santa Barbara, and slightly more than an inch of rain fell just
west of Gaviota.
   Rain also fell over northwestern through west-central California.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 23 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo., and Houghton Lake and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at International Falls and Warroad, Minn., to 92 at
Carlsbad, N.M.

<HEAD>King Fahd Releases 7,700 Inmates in Goodwill Ramadan Gesture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Monday it had
freed nearly 7,700 inmates, including all political prisoners, as a
goodwill gesture marking the holy month of Ramadan.
   There is ``not a single political prisoner'' in the kingdom,
according to an Interior Ministry announcement broadcast by
state-run Riyadh radio, because King Fahd had declared amnesty for
7,681 prisoners.
   The gesture was made possible by benefactors who donated about
$87 million to help pay the public and private debts of some
prisoners, the ministry said.
   In a report on Saudi Arabia issued in January, the London-based
human rights group Amnesty International said more than 700 people
were detained without trial from 1983 to 1989, mainly Shiite
Moslems, including Iranian-backed fundamentalists.
   The report said at least 100 people were seized last year and
named 66 held in three prisons.
   Saudi Arabia denied the report. Monday's announcement did not
specifically refer to the Shiites.
   Those still jailed were being held for capital crimes or were
convicted and awaiting sentencing.
   Capital crimes under Islamic law include murder, punishable by
beheading; adultery, punishable by stoning; and thievery,
punishable by cutting of hands from the wrist. In recent years,
beheading was also decreed by Moslem theologians for drug smuggling.
   The amnesty included Saudis and foreigners, but no breakdown was
released. It referred to an unspecified number of foreigners
detained for various misdemeanors, financial crimes and public law
violations. It said their embassies were asked to prepare for their
deportation, as is customary.
   It is a tradition for rulers in Islamic countries to issue
amnesties during Ramadan and other Moslem occasions. Islamic law
also allows for benefactors, sometimes anonymous, to settle
prisoners' debts as an act of charity.
   Neighboring Gulf countries have already announced their
amnesties for Ramadan, but they have not exceeded 200 prisoners.
   The Saudi statement did not identify the benefactors. In
neighboring United Arab Emirates, President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan
Al Nahyan personally underwrote the debt of the 150 prisoners
released in the capital Abu Dhabi.

<HEAD>Turkey on Thanksgiving, Rabbit on Easter, Says Preacher</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preacher who says the Easter Bunny is nothing
more than a pagan icon served barbecued rabbit to the needy, hoping
to shift the focus to the true meaning of the Christian holiday.
   ``Just like turkey is served on Thanksgiving, I would like to
see rabbit served in homes across America every Easter,'' said the
Rev. Larry Rice, director of the New Life Evangelistic Center in
St. Louis.
   Rice came up with the idea to attract more attention to the
original meaning of Easter, a Christian holy day that celebrates
the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise of everlasting
life.
   ``The Easter Bunny is tremendous competition to that message,''
Rice said Monday. ``We like to think of ourselves as a Christian
nation, but our focus on a mystical rabbit is really paganistic.''
   The New Life Center, a privately operated shelter for the poor
in downtown St. Louis, bought 604 rabbits to serve on Easter
Sunday, Rice said, primarily because they were cheaper than beef or
pork.
   People who came to the Easter dinners didn't have to eat rabbit
if they didn't want to, Rice said.
   About 500 people could choose from grilled rabbit, sauteed
rabbit, rabbit cacciatore, turkey or ham.
   ``The majority of people ate rabbit, but that's partly because
we only cooked 10 turkeys,'' said Ruth Powell, a volunteer at New
Life who planned the dinner. ``I was surprised by the number of
people that wanted the rabbit.''
   Yvonne Dozier, seated at dinner with her 8-month-old baby,
James, didn't have a problem eating rabbit.
   ``It's great,'' she said, tearing into her dinner. ``There ain't
no such thing as the Easter Bunny, and I ain't no kid. This is just
food _ good food,'' she said.
   In Kansas City, about 200 people were given a piece of chicken
and a piece of rabbit.
   Rice said he's received some calls from people who canceled
their plans to make donations to his shelter. One woman called to
complain about the psychological counseling children were going to
need because of his idea.
   But he said overall, response was positive.
   ``I'm toying with another idea for later this year. There's a
lot of hunting for deer around Christmas and we might take
advantage of that and serve white-tail deer, mule deer, even
reindeer,'' Rice said.

<HEAD>Administration Will Not Ban Offset Military Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday it would
not forbid American companies from offering special purchasing
incentives to win contracts for military sales aboard, though it
will not encourage thoce incentives either.
   A White House statement said that incentives, known in military
circles as offsets, have become a common feature in the
international arms trade. An offset is a requirement that the
selling company buy a certain amount of goods and services in the
buying country.
   ``The decision whether to engage in offsets, and the
responsibility for negotiating and implementing offset
arrangements, resides with the companies involved,'' the White
House said in a policy statement issued under President Bush's name.
   The administration said no agency of the U.S. government will
encourage offsets or commit U.S. firms to offset deals.
   Moreover, it said that no U.S. government funds will be used to
finance offsets in security assistance deals ``except in accordance
with currently established policies and procedures.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the government
views offsets for military exports ``as economically inefficient
and market distorting.''
   One case of offsets cited by the Pentagon involved the recent
purchase of 11 airborne radar warning and control planes from
Boeing by Britain and France in an $1.8 billion deal.
   The two countries demanded an offset from Boeing of 130 percent,
meaning that the manufacturer would have to buy more than $2.3
billion in goods and services from Britain and France.
   Such an arrangement puts the U.S. company in the role of a
middleman for selling the foreign countries' goods if they have
nothing to sell that the U.S. company needs immediately.

   A brush fire started by farmers to
clear their land set off explosions Monday at a nearby air base
ammunition dump, wrecking a Soviet-made cargo carrier and damaging
a second airplane, police chief Rene Vivas said.
   Vivas said a gust of wind spread the fire to the air force base
adjoining Managua international airport, and the blasts destroyed
the AN-26 cargo plane. He said a second air force plane, also
parked on a runway, was damaged but gave no further details.
   Officials said the airport was immediately shut to traffic until
further notice as a precaution.
   The midday explosions were heard throughout the capital, but
Vivas told reporters that although many residents were alarmed,
``There are no victims and there was no major damage.''
   Vivas said farmers were burning brush and weeds to clear their
field for planting when a strong wind spread the flames to open
ground at the air base where explosive material and fuel was stored.
   Fire brigades at the airport quickly brought the blaze under
control, Vivas said, who added he doubted ``very much'' that the
explosions could have been caused by sabotage.
   U.S.-supported Contra rebels have been fighting Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government for nine years, and President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's civilian administration takes office
for a six-year term April 25.
   Most of the rebels have refused to surrender their weapons and
demobilize until Mrs. Chamorro takes office and exercises control
over the Sandinista-dominated military.

<HEAD>Thousands of Teachers Demonstrate at Oklahoma Capitol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of teachers went on strike Monday
to show their anger over a failed $230 million education
improvement package, and many picketed at the state Capitol.
   Teachers say their pay ranks 48th in the nation. The minimum
beginning salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree is $15,060.
   The crowd outside the Capitol was estimated at more than 10,000
by Nancy Jewell, vice president of the Oklahoma Education
Association. Other estimates ranged up from 5,000.
   Hundreds of teachers clogged legislative halls inside the
Capitol, lobbying for additional school funding.
   ``If you can read this, thank a teacher. If you can't, thank a
legislator,'' read a sign carried by one picket.
   Schools were closed in more than 145 of the state's 606 school
districts, where more than half the education association's members
are teachers, said association President Kyle Dahlem. The
association represents 80 percent of Oklahoma's teachers.
   The Tulsa school district, the largest in the state, was among
those closed. Schools were open in Oklahoma City, but not in many
of the capital city's suburbs.
   Teachers in Oklahoma City and some other districts said they
feared reprisals if they took part in the strike. School
administrators supported the walkout in some areas and opposed it
in others.
   At the Capitol, the knob to the main door of Gov. Henry
Bellmon's office was loosened because so many teachers wanted to
register their presence, said Andrew Tevington, Bellmon's chief of
staff.
   Bellmon asked state Attorney General Robert Henry to go to
court, if necessary, to block the walkout. Henry issued a statement
late Monday saying it did not appear immediate legal action was
warranted.
   Henry said state law forbidding strikes against local school
boards did not appear to apply in the case of a walkout to express
dissatisfaction with legislative action.
   The education association called for a five-day teacher walkout
after the Oklahoma Senate failed last week to pass the school
reform bill as an emergency measure, which would have put it into
effect immediately.
   The measure has been the work of an eight-month special session
Bellmon called in August to improve Oklahoma schools.
   The Republican governor supported the bill, but only one of the
Senate's 15 Republicans voted for it Wednesday, along with seven of
the Senate's 33 Democrats.
   After the Senate voted Wednesday to drop the emergency clause,
legislative leaders got the Senate to send the bill back to
committee to keep it from going to Bellmon without the provision.
   The bill mandates greater equity in the way state funds are
allocated, salary increases for teachers, a school consolidation
plan, and a program to close schools that don't meet accreditation
requirements,
   It calls for an additional $212 million for schools that could
be used for teacher salaries and other items, and proposes $1,500
increases in minimum teachers' salaries for each of the next four
years.
   Much of the opposition was stirred by the plan for taxes to
support the reforms, including a half-cent increase in the state's
4-cent sales tax and increases in corporate and personal income
taxes.
   Senate President Pro Tempore Bob Cullison said there were
negotiations over the weekend to revive the school bill, which he
had said last week was apparently dead. He said he could not
comment on whether there had been any progress toward a compromise.
   Ms. Dahlem said critics of the walkout should ``come walk in our
shoes and then tell me that what we are doing isn't necessary _
that this isn't the last resort on a list of options that have all
failed over long months of pushing, pulling, frustration and
compromise'' only for education supporters to come up empty-handed.
   The walkout was supported by the National Education Association,
which has 2 million members. NEA President Keith Geiger and other
officials of the national group issued a statement saying there was
``an educational emergency in Oklahoma right now.''

<HEAD>Pediatric Group Urges Increased Caution on TV Viewing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBRA HALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-term television viewing is one cause of
violent or aggressive behavior in children and contributes
substantially to childhood obesity, the American Academy of
Pediatrics said Monday.
   In its first policy statement on children and television since
1984, the 39,000-member academy called for more involvement by
parents and pediatricians in regulating children's viewing, and
urged that viewing time be cut in half.
   By the time a child today reaches age 70, he or she will have
spent approximately seven years watching television, the
pediatricians said.
   ``For some children, the world shown on television becomes the
real world,'' the statement said.
   The academy also recommended:
   _Intensifying efforts to teach parents and pediatricians about
television's influence, and promoting critical viewing among
children.
   _Parents' limiting children's viewing to one to two hours daily
and developing activities such as reading, athletics and hobbies.
   _Supporting legislation making broadcast of high-quality
children's programming a condition of license renewal and mandating
at least one hour per day of educational children's programming.
   _Supporting efforts to ban programs that have toys as main
characters.
   _Portraying sexuality responsibly.
   _Working to eliminate alcohol ads on television and encouraging
extensive counter advertising.
   A.C. Nielsen Co. data indicate children ages 2 to 5 watch TV
about 25 hours weekly; 6- to 11-year-olds, more than 22 hours
weekly; and 12-to 17-year-olds, 23 hours per week, said the policy
statement.
   ``We're asking that parents cut their kids' television viewing
in half or more,'' said Dr. Victor Strasburger of the University of
New Mexico School of Medicine. He added that the academy did not
recommend a time limit five years ago.
   Experts have established a link between heavy television viewing
and obesity, he said. The policy statement credits a 1985 study by
Drs. W.H. Dietz and S.L. Gortmaker that appeared in the journal
Pediatrics.
   Dietz, a member of the academy committee that prepared the
policy statement, has done followup research, Strasburger said.
   ``It could be that television watching is such a sedentary
activity,'' he said in a telephone interview Monday. ``It could be
because the nutritional messages on television are so terrible. Or
it could be that kids usually ... eat while they're watching
television. ... It probably is all three.''
   He said TV still offers ``a steady diet of violence,'' causing
some children to believe ``that if you're the good guy, violence
can be acceptable'' to solve some problems.
   The policy statement also calls for contraceptive advertising
and for responsible portrayals of sex.
   Strasburger said ``no national networks have been brave enough
... or public-spirited enough'' to advertise contraceptives.
``They're so wrapped up in business decisions they really don't see
that this is an urgent public health matter, not just because of
AIDS'' but also because of teen-age pregnancy.
   He said soap operas offer the worst examples of sex on
television and are shown when small children often watch TV.
   What TV airs ``at 10 o'clock at night is not what we're worried
about,' he noted. ``It's what they put on at 2 o'clock in the
afternoon.''
   Despite TV's negative aspects, he said, the academy believes
``it's OK to use the television set occasionally as an electronic
baby-sitter.'' But parents should videotape programs they approve
of ``rather than let the kids play `channel roulette.'''
   In calling for an end to programs featuring toys as the main
characters, the academy reasoned that such shows are really
marketing vehicles.
   ``Saturday morning television is still the vast wasteland that
it was 10 or 15 years ago,'' Strasburger said. ``It could be far
more educational than it is. The fact that it hasn't changed is
really a reflection'' on the Federal Communications Commission.''
   William Johnson, deputy chief of the FCC's Mass Media Bureau,
said the problem the agency faces in regulating children's
programming borders on censorship.
   Another issue, Johnson said, is whether the federal government
should arbitrarily decide between good and bad programming. ``How
do we define it, and how would you enforce that?'' he said in a
telephone interview from Washington.
   He said cable TV outlets have provided more opportunities for
good children's programming, and said there was much less violence
on children's programs than before.
   Spokesmen for ABC, NBC and CBS could not be reached for comment
by telephone late Monday because they were either gone for the day
or unavailable.

   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand a
ban on school dances in this Bible Belt town, prompting an opponent
to lament a victory ``for liars, cheats and hypocrites.''
   Opponents said they now hoped the school board would voluntarily
lift the rule, but officials said they wouldn't discuss the issue
until May.
   The high court without comment rejected arguments that the
no-dance rule was religiously motivated and violated the
constitutionally required separation of church and state. A federal
appeals court in September upheld the ban.
   ``I'm disappointed by the ruling but I'm not surprised,'' said
attorney William Fleischaker, who represented 21 Purdy High School
students and their parents who filed a lawsuit in 1986 seeking to
overturn the ban in this Ozarks town.
   ``We knew the odds against us were pretty strong. We had hoped
we could get the ear of someone at the Supreme Court and get them
to review the situation. Obviously, that didn't happen,'' he said.
   No further legal appeals are planned, Fleischaker said.
   School Superintendent Sheldon Buxton declined to speculate
whether the school board would again prohibit all school-sponsored
dances or modify or abandon the rule.
   The board was scheduled to hold its regular meeting Monday night
but didn't plan to discuss the ruling, Buxton said.
   ``This is not the time or place for the board to gloat,'' said
board President Glenn Garrett. ``It is time for the board,
administration, faculty, students and the Purdy citizens to set
about healing the divisions caused by this litigation.''
   The student body president and several other students refused to
comment as they were leaving school Monday afternoon.
   ``I think the students are just glad to see it all end,'' said
Becky Woods, a high-school physical education teacher and Purdy
native. ``There was excitement about the first dance, but then the
whole thing dragged on so long, the press got into it, and now I
think students just don't care where they dance, at the school or
elsewhere.''
   School board member Alan Keeling praised the ruling, saying it's
best for the board to decide whether dances should be held. He said
board members had been confident they would win the case.
   Buxton said three dances have been held at the school since U.S.
District Judge Russell Clark in Springfield ruled in 1988 that the
no-dance rule was unconstitutional. Clark's ruling was overturned
by the appeals court.
   He said the dances went smoothly with no problems and no
complaints from five fundamentalist ministers in the southwestern
Missouri community of 900 who regard dancing as ``satanic'' and
``sinful'' and led support for the ban.
   ``I'm relieved that this situation has come to a closing
point,'' Buxton said. ``I think the support and interest in the
school that has been shown from people on both sides will help the
healing process, allow us to get back to business as usual and put
this issue behind us.''
   The ban on dancing at the high school, which has an enrollment
of about 230, drew national attention for its similarity to the
movie ``Footloose.'' The 1984 film centered on a fight in a
fictional Texas small town between young people and city fathers,
who thought dancing sinful and immoral.
   Joan Fox, a parent and plaintiff along with her son and husband,
said the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case ``is a real loss
for students in this community and around the country.''
   ``It's an extreme victory for liars, cheats and hypocrites,''
she said. ``I think the judicial system in this country has gone to
pot.''
   Mrs. Fox called on the school board to voluntarily abandon the
100-year-old dance ban.
   ``The kids have had several successful, wonderful dances and I
hope the school board realizes that it's for the kids' benefit to
have dances on campus,'' she said. ``I hope they don't tell them to
get lost, which is what they've always said previously.''
   Fleischaker said he hoped school board members would note how
well the first three dances had gone and permit future dances. This
year's junior-senior prom will be held in the nearby community of
Monett at students' request, school officials said.
   ``There certainly has been strong and vocal opposition to
school-sponsored dancing,'' Fleischaker said. ``I would hope the
opposition has mellowed a bit.''

   A 10-year-old girl whose mother taught her
the Heimlich manuever used it to save her brother, who was choking
on a jawbreaker.
   Adrienne Sharpe and two younger brothers were at their
grandparents' home Saturday when the youngest, Schuyler, 4, got the
jawbreaker lodged in his throat.
   Two uncles rushed to Schuyler after the boy began waving his
arms for help, but they couldn't dislodge the candy.
   Adrienne first ran to the house to tell her grandfather, then
returned, grabbed her brother and began the manuever, a thrusting
motion from behind the victim that forces the rescuer's fist into
the rib cage.
   ``When I did the Heimlich the second time, the jawbreaker just
flew out,'' the girl said. Schuyler didn't need to be hospitalized.
   The children's mother, Glenda, a licensed practical nurse who
works at an adult care center, taught her children the manuever
last summer when she had to be recertified in lifesaving techniques.
   Adrienne said she found the training fun at the time.
   ``I didn't think it was funny when my brother was choking
though,'' she said. ``I was glad mom had taught us.''

   Police fined a truck driver Monday for trying
to pass off a dummy of a woman _ complete with lipstick and a wig _
as a passenger in a car-pooling lane.
   State Trooper Richard Edmonds was patrolling the northbound
restricted lane of Interstate 279 Monday morning, looking for
speeders and violators of the occupancy requirement: three people
per vehicle.
   He spotted a pickup truck with what looked like three occupants
in the front seat _ a male driver, a woman in the middle and
another man, who had his arm around the woman's shoulders.
   Not quite convinced, Edmonds followed the truck to get a better
look.
   ``When he got close enough for a better look, the trooper waved
the driver over,'' said Sgt. Jim Garofalo. ``The female passenger
wasn't too bad looking, but she was a dummy.''
   The driver, identified as Earl W. Heintzinger, 36, of
Pittsburgh, was given a ticket with a $82.50 fine for violating the
lane limit.
   Garofalo said the dummy, taken to police barracks in Findlay
Township, was made of a plastic head tied to a costumed torso, with
a nylon stocking over the head. It had on lipstick, eye makeup and
a wig.

   A slow but persistent lava flow from
Kilauea Volcano oozed to within 800 feet of a housing subdivision
Monday after destroying an isolated home the day before,
authorities said.
   The flow had the potential to reach homes at the western edge of
the Kalapana Gardens subdivision by Monday evening, said Harry Kim,
administrator of the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.
   There are 80 homes in Kalapana Gardens and 43 others in the
surrounding coastal community.
   Lava was following the path of a flow that entered Kalapana
Gardens two weeks ago and destroyed two homes.
   On Sunday, lava encircled the home of Carl Mildrum about a half
mile east of Kalapana Gardens. The home was destroyed when a finger
of lava passed close enough to ignite the wooden structure.
   It was the 80th dwelling destroyed since Kilauea's current
eruption began more than seven years ago.

   An attorney for an art gallery and its
director pleaded innocent Monday to charges they displayed obscene
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   H. Louis Sirkin, attorney for the Contemporary Arts Center and
director Dennis Barrie, filed the written pleas in Hamilton County
Municipal Court about two hours before a scheduled arraignment. The
action effectively waived a court appearance for the parties.
   Barrie and the gallery face misdemeanor charges of pandering
obscenity and use of a minor in nudity-oriented material. If
convicted on both charges, Barrie could face up to a year in jail
and a $2,000 fine, and the center could be fined up to $10,000.
   Judge David Albanese set a pretrial hearing for April 30, when a
trial date could be set.
   Sirkin said it is possibl the case may not go to trial until
after the Mapplethorpe exhibit ends its Cincinnati run May 26.
   The indictment singles out seven of the photos, which show naked
children and homosexual acts. Grand jury members viewed the exhibit
before returning the indictment.
   About 25 demonstrators supporting the Contemporary Arts Center
chanted and waved signs outside the Hamilton County Courthouse. One
sign read: ``Myopic Politicians Are Suffocating the People with
Backward Social Structures.''
   In another development, Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur M. Ney
Jr., whose office obtained the indictment April 7, announced Monday
his office will not prosecute the case and will instead hand it
over to City Solicitor Richard Castellini. Ney said Ohio law
requires the transfer because the case has been moved into
municipal court as a misdemeanor offense, and because the alleged
offense occurred within the city.
   Critics have suggested Ney got rid of the case as a political
hot potato and that his office has routinely prosecuted misdemeanor
cases before. Ney declined to comment further.
   The arts center began displaying the 175-photo exhibit April 7.
By Monday, more than 25,000 people had viewed the show.
   Since late 1988, the exhibit has appeared in Philadelphia,
Chicago, Hartford, Conn.; and Washington, drawing large crowds. It
goes to Boston in August to complete its national tour.
   The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington canceled the exhibit,
but a smaller gallery there displayed the show. The Washington
exhibit prompted Congress to limit funds for the arts after Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared the photographs obscene.
   Mapplethorpe, 42, died in March 1989 in New York City of AIDS.

   Nelson Mandela stepped triumphantly onto the world
stage at a concert full of rock stars Monday night and urged foes
of apartheid to wage unrelenting war against the system that jailed
him for 27 years in South Africa.
   The 71-year-old black nationalist leader, standing before a
sellout crowd of 72,000 at Wembley Stadium, beamed with pleasure
and obvious affection as seven minutes of applause and cheers
washed over him.
   With his wife, Winnie, standing nearby, Mandela then spoke
forcefully for a half-hour, interrupted about 30 times by applause.
The fatigue that showed in his face earlier vanished as he thanked
supporters and spoke of the need to carry on the fight.
   The address was telecast to millions in 40 countries.
   International stars filled the stadium with music and the crowd
danced, sang and chanted ``Mandela is free!'' before the deputy
president of the African National Congress spoke.
   It was his largest audience since his release from prison Feb.
11, where he was serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the government.
   The concert sold out in two days. Among those who paid $33 to
attend were American politician Jesse Jackson and Neil Kinnock,
leader of Britain's opposition Labor Party.
   Top British reggae group Aswad kicked off the celebration, which
featured Simple Minds, Grammy Award-winner Bonnie Raitt, Neil
Young, Soul II Soul, The Neville Brothers, Peter Gabriel, Anita
Baker, Tracy Chapman and Oscar-winning actor Denzel Washington, who
played murdered black activist Steve Biko in the film ``Cry
Freedom.''
   Miriam Makeba canceled her scheduled appearance for reasons of
health.
   Said Mandela, ``We are meeting here to celebrate the victory
represented by the release of some of us. We must, however,
remember that only a few have been released.
   ``A greater number remains in prison, we should therefore treat
this day of celebration as one of rededication to ... the struggle
for the emancipation of all the remaining political prisoners ...
and (against) the system which keeps the outstanding sons and
daughters of our people in jail.''
   He begged the world not to stop fighting the racial separation
system in white-dominated South Africa that denies the black
majority the vote.
   ``The apartheid crime against humanity remains in place. It
continues to kill and maim ... to oppress and exploit. Its
blood-stained offspring continue to rain death and destruction on
the peoples of Mozambique and Angola. Every day it produces orphans
throughout southern Africa,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela said sanctions should be maintained and that Pretoria
must not be rewarded for releasing political prisoners or lifting
the ban on the ANC.
   His audience filled the playing field and most of the stands. A
huge banner across the stage said: ``The Struggle Is My Life,'' the
title of a book of Mandela's writings and speeches.
   Mandela, wearing a navy blue blazer and a tie striped in the
black, green and gold colors of the ANC, told reporters before his
speech, ``Twenty-seven years ago when I went to jail I had no vote.
I have come out and I still have no vote. ''
   He said concerts such as this one were important for raising
world awareness.
   ``I think artists can play a very decisive role in the fight for
human rights. Artists can reach quarters not nececssarily
interested in politics through music, which interests everybody, so
that the message can go further than we politicians can push it.''
   Mandela told the crowd:
   ``Dear friends, it will not be long now before we see the end of
the apartheid system. The dreams of millions of people to see our
country free and at peace will be realized sooner rather than
later. We are determined to ensure that our country is transformed
from being the skunk of the world into an exemplary oasis of
unrivaled race relations, democracy for all, a just peace and
freedom from poverty and human degradation.''
   He thanked those around the world who had clamored for his
release, including the thousands who attended a ``free-Mandela''
concert at Wembley two years ago.
   ``Even through the thickness of the prison walls ... we heard
your voices demanding our freedom. During all the days we spent
buried in the apartheid dungeons, we never lost our confidence in
the certainty of our release and our victory over the apartheid
system.''
   Mandela spoke warmly of ANC President Oliver Tambo, who is in
Sweden recovering from a stroke. Tambo's wife, Adelaide, sat with
them in the stadium's executive box.
   ``There is no man in this country or anywhere else in the world
who could have performed as magnificently in the past 10 years,''
Mandela said.
   As Mandela left the stage and Tracy Chapman started to sing
``Talking About a Revolution,'' the huge crowd danced in joy.
   Jesse Jackson praised Mandela at a news conference, saying: ``He
is in good health. His vision is clear, his objectives are clear
and he's gaining world support.''
   The Mandelas arrived about an hour after the concert started,
smiling and waving their fists in the air as the crowd cheered.
   They flew to London on Sunday to attend and left immediately
after the concert to fly to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Concert organizers said part of the proceeds will go to
charities, including Oxfam and Save The Children Fund. They gave no
estimate because the sale of television rights was still under way.

   Black leaders appealed for unity and
increased activism Monday at the funeral of a black teen-ager whose
shooting by a white policeman sparked a suburban rampage.
   About 300 people packed Community Baptist Church in this New
York suburb for the funeral of Phillip Pannell, 16, and about 200
more gathered outside to listen to the service over a speaker. Most
were black.
   Elected officials, religious leaders and community officials
took turns at the pulpit to call for solidarity in the wake of
Pannell's death.
   Pannell was killed in Teaneck last Tuesday by an officer
responding to reports that the youth was brandishing a gun. A vigil
there the following night turned violent, with angry black youths
smashing police car windows and looting stores.
   ``No longer will we put up with public officials putting guns in
the hands of people untrained to our needs,'' said Theo Bolden, a
junior at Teaneck High School. ``Today we say goodbye to Phillip
Pannell, but with our minds and hearts and souls we must say hello
to the black community of tomorrow.''
   George Powell, president of the Bergen County chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, touched
on a theme heard throughout the two-hour service, saying parents in
the minority community must listen to children who complain of
racial harassment.
   ``We apologize to our children for letting them down and not
lending an attentive ear in a critical time of need,'' Powell said.
   The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, the Pannell family's pastor, read the
names of about 10 blacks killed recently in altercations with
police in the New York metropolitan area. Despite the riot in
Teaneck the day after Pannell's death, the black community has been
complacent in responding to violence from police, he said.
   ``I just wonder what would happen if a black officer killed a
15-year-old Irish, Italian or Jewish kid,'' said Daughtry. ``I
submit to you we would not have a few broken windows down in
Teaneck.''
   Pannell was shot by Teaneck police Officer Gary Spath, who has
since been suspended with pay. Wayne Blanco, the officer who
responded with Spath, has been temporarily relieved of his duties.
   An autopsy by the Bergen County medical examiner showed Pannell
was shot once in the back. An investigation showed that Spath's
.38-caliber service revolver was fired twice, while Blanco's
revolver was not fired.
   A grand jury is to consider the case Tuesday.

   Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson, a
key figure in arranging U.S.-PLO talks, arrived in Egypt's capital
Monday for a meeting with PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
   But Arafat instead arrived in Amman, Jordan, late Monday and
told reporters he did not plan to meet with Andersson in Cairo
because he already had talks with him Sunday in Tunisia.
   Andersson had been scheduled to meet Tuesday with the Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman and Egypt's foreign minister,
Esmet Abdel Meguid, before leaving for Tunisia.
   Sweden has in the past worked as a go-between in secret talks
between the United States and the PLO. Those talks led to Arafat's
renunciation of terrorism and, in response, the United States
lifted its 13-year-old embargo on official contacts with the PLO in
December 1988.
   Arafat's official spokesman, Bassam Abu-Sharif, said Arafat met
Andersson Sunday on the Tunisian island of Garba. In an interview
prior to Arafat's arrival in the Jordanian capital, Abu-Sharif said
the PLO was not ruling out another meeting between Arafat and
Andersson.
   Speaking to reporters shortly after his arrival, Andersson said
Sweden is trying to ``facilitate'' the establishment of direct
Palestinian-Israeli talks.
   ``There are developments in Israel that could help bring about a
dialogue,'' he said.
   In recent weeks, Shimon Peres, the leader of Israel's
left-leaning Labor Party has been trying to put together a new
coalition government that would back direct talks with Palestinians.

   The Coast Guard searched the Atlantic Ocean
off Georgia and South Carolina for three missing fishermen Monday
after a fourth man was plucked from a wooden box in which he may
have been floating for days.
   Nathan Nesmith was found drifting in an open box about 9 a.m.
Monday by a passing boat about 20 miles east of Hilton Head Island,
S.C., said Petty Officer Brett Farrell of the Coast Guard's rescue
station on Tybee Island, Ga.
   Nesmith, 32, was in serious condition at Memorial Medical Center
in Savannah, suffering from hypothermia and dehydration, said
hospital spokeswoman Ronnie Boaen.
   The man told his rescuers he was one of four crew members on a
34-foot commercial fishing boat that sank after it left Darien,
Ga., last Wednesday, Farrell said. The 34-foot boat was en route to
a fishing area off Edisto Beach, S.C., he said.
   Coast Guard officials didn't know when the boat sank or how long
the man had floated in the box, which may have been used as an
engine cover, Farrell said.
   ``As far as I know he was conscious; he was answering questions,
fairly coherent,'' he said. ``He was mainly just worn out from
floating for however many days he's been out there.''
   Farrell said the Coast Guard sent two boats and two helicopters
to search for the fishing boat's three other crew members, but no
sign of them had been found by Monday afternoon.
   Boaters and commercial fishermen were helping with the search,
which was centered about 30 miles east of Hilton Head, Farrell said.
   He said the boat had not been reported missing. Commercial
fishing vessels frequently make weeklong trips off the Georgia and
South Carolina coasts and ``don't keep communication scheduled with
anybody unless they just happen to pass another boat,'' Farrell
said.
   Farrell identified the missing men as Billy Joe Nesmith, 23,
Keith Wilkes, 18, and Franklin Brantly 23.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said Monday
that the U.S.-backed Contra rebels have been carrying out raids in
northern Nicaragua despite his promises to turn power over to a
newly elected government.
   ``Blood continues to flow and the Contras have not
disappeared,'' Ortega said to a group of visiting Protestant
evangelists. ``We have to pray to God for peace.''
   Also Monday, about 260 Nicaraguan Indians who fought alongside
the Contras turned their weapons over to international peacekeepers
in Honduras. Another 1,000 fighters are scheduled to give up their
weapons on Wednesday.
   Ortega urged the evangelists, led by the Rev. Jorge Raschke of
Puerto Rico, to pray that ``the Contras are disarmed and there be
peace in the country'' after President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro succeeds him on April 25.
   Mrs. Chamorro's United National Opposition, a 14-party
coalition, won the Feb. 25 national elections, ending a decade of
Sandinista rule.
   The Contras and Ortega's Sandinista government have been
exchanging charges and countercharges for weeks, each claiming that
the other side plans to retain their weapons after Ortega steps
down.
   The Sandanistas have vowed to leave office peacefully, but have
argued that they should retain control of the military to combat
the Contras.
   The U.S.-backed Contra rebels have waged a nine-year civil war
to topple the Sandinistas.
   The Sandinistas say sporadic clashes have been occurring in the
northern areas of the country and a Sandinista military spokeswoman
accused the rebels of planning a massive offensive to pry
concessions from the government.
   ``They are trying to make the president (Mrs. Chamorro)
negotiate,'' said Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos.
   The Sandinistas have demanded the Contras demobilize before Mrs.
Chamorro's inauguaration.
   Some Contra leaders have agreed, but others say they will not
put down their weapons until they are sure the Sandinistas will
turn over full control of the government to Mrs. Chamorro's
administration.
   The demobilization continued Monday as a group of Nicaraguan
Indians surrendered their weapons to Gen. Agustin Quesada Gomez,
the Spanish commander of a United Nations peacekeeping force, in
the Honduran town of Sirsitara, about 40 miles from the Nicaraguan
border.
   The fighters were members of Yatama, an organization of Miskito,
Suma and Rama Indians from Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. They have
been fighting the Sandinistas since 1981.
   Forty Venezuelan soldiers in the U.N. force set about destroying
the rebel weapons, mainly Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifles.
   ``It is a sad day for us, but the decision has been taken,''
Yamata chief, Serafino Bencie, told reporters as his men
surrendered their arms.
   Quesada Gomez said each rifle will be cut into three pieces and
then blown up with explosives.

even know why they came to Dallas to do this,'' said activist Ada
Edwards, referring to a change of venue.
   The killing of Ida Lee Delaney, along with another killing of a
black motorist by a white officer, has been the focus of protests
by blacks and calls for reform of Houston's police force.
   The former officer, Alex Gonzales, 25, is accused of killing
Mrs. Delaney, 50, last fall during an exchange of gunfire following
a highway chase while he was off-duty.
   Prosecutors say the case has nothing to do with race, so the
racial makeup of the jury isn't important.
   ``The State of Texas is very happy with the jury,'' said Don
Smyth, assistant Harris County district attorney. ``We think
they'll do a fine job. As we've been telling eveyrbody else, this
is not a racial case. Some folks are trying to make it a racial
case.''
   ``It's not a surprise,'' said Ms. Edwards, one of more than 40
people who drove from Houston to Dallas to monitor the trial. ``I
just hope the process will carry itself out and that those people
are people who will be willing to hear the entire story.''
   ``I feel like this trial, this marching, none of this should be
going on,'' said Ora Shaw, a sister of the dead woman who has taken
part in protests. ``She was murdered ... for nothing.''
   The case was moved to Dallas because of pretrial publicity in
Houston.
   Ms. Edwards said activists were more concerned with the process
than the outcome of Gonzales' murder trial. But, she said, ``He is
guilty of killing Ida Delaney. Now if they want to get technical
about what level of guilt, I can't speak to that.''
   Some of the spectators in the Dallas County courtroom were
ushered out to make space for 60 potential jurors.
   Mrs. Delaney's was killed within two weeks of the death of Byron
Gillum, who was shot eight times after a traffic stop by an officer
who said he saw Gillum reach for a gun. The officer hasn't been
charged. A gun was recovered from Gillum's car.
   Ms. Edwards, who is co-chair of the Ida Lee Delaney-Byron Gillum
Justice Committee, said the group and volunteer attorneys would
watch the trial ``to make sure the community is aware of what
happened.''
   Testimony is expected to begin Tuesday, said Don Smyth, who
heads the Harris County District Attorney's office's civil rights
division and is prosecuting Gonzales.
   Mrs. Delaney, driving to work on a Houston freeway, apparently
cut off Gonzales and two other off-duty officers in an unmarked car
about 5 a.m. on Oct. 31. She pulled over after a 12-mile chase, and
Mrs. Delaney and Gonzales exchanged gunfire.
   Gonzales' attorney, Mike Hinton, said Mrs. Delaney fired first.
   The off-duty officers had been attending a birthday party at a
nightclub for several hours before the shooting. Hospital records
showed Gonzales was legally intoxicated when he sought treatment
for gunshot wounds to the abdomen.
   All three officers were fired, but only Gonzales was indicted on
a murder charge by a grand jury. All are appealing their firings to
independent arbitrators.
   Activist groups in Dallas and Houston planned to monitor the
proceeding.
   Eva McMillan, of the Dallas Anti-Apartheid Coalition, said
Dallas juries tend to ``disregard the people.''
   ``I think nothing should be handed down but a guilty verdict,''
Ms. McMillan said. ``But knowing Texas justice, especially Dallas,
and the type of juries Dallas selects ... juries which will vote in
favor of the Establishment.''
   One Houston activist, Alkebu Motapa, said he would fast
throughout the trial, which attorneys say could last two weeks.
   ``Throughout the trial, I'll be in constant prayer and
meditation for justice,'' Motapa said.
   Ms. Edwards said activists want Houston to establish a civilian
review board of police.
   The committee organized a march that attracted 200 people in
Houston Saturday. On Sunday, members planted a black cross near
where Gillum was killed.
   Earlier this month, Harris County grand jurors declined to
indict former Officer Scott Tschirhart, 27, in Gillum's death.
Gillum was the third black civilian killed by Tschirhart during the
officer's seven years on the Houston force.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused
to hear an appeal from a man condemned to die for killing an
attorney during a 1985 courthouse shootout.
   The justices denied Ronnie Lee Gardner's bid for a Supreme Court
hearing without comment, except for customary dissenting statements
by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose
capital punishment under all circumstances.
   Gardner, 27, was sentenced to die for gunning down Michael J.
Burdell during a botched escape attempt April 2, 1985, at Salt Lake
City's Metropolitan Hall of Justice.
   Police said a girlfriend of Gardner's slipped him a handgun
while he was being transported to a hearing on a separate
second-degree murder charge stemming from the 1984 slaying of a
bartender.
   Though shackled hand and foot, Gardner turned the weapon on two
Utah State Prison guards accompanying him. One of the guards shot
Gardner in the shoulder before he fled, confronted Burdell and shot
the attorney once in the head. Gardner also wounded a bailiff
before surrendering.
   In February 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Gardner's appeal
following a three-year review.
   Defense attorneys had argued that Gardner should have been
granted a change of venue due to pretrial publicity. His lawyers
also contended that the state district judge who tried the case
should have removed himself, since he was in the courthouse at the
time of Gardner's escape attempt.
   Gardner's attorneys were not immediately available for comment
on the latest decision.

   The Galileo spacecraft successfully
fired its thrusters almost 1,600 times during a four-day maneuver
designed to help it reach Jupiter in 1995, NASA said Monday.
   The sequence of thruster pulses, completed late last Thursday,
slowed the spacecraft by about 55 mph, said Jim Wilson, a spokesman
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   The next set of maneuvers is scheduled for this summer, said Bob
MacMillin another spokesman.
   The 2.8-ton Galileo was launched on its $1.35 billion mission by
the space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18.
   It flew past Venus on Feb. 9 so that planet could act as a
``gravity slingshot'' to help propel the spacecraft on its looping
2.4-billion-mile, six-year journey to Jupiter, the solar system's
largest planet.
   The spacecraft will fly past Earth on Dec. 8 of this year and
again on Dec. 8, 1990, in two more ``gravity slingshot'' maneuvers.
   Galileo will examine Earth, Earth's moon and one or two
asteroids before the spacecraft separates into an orbiter and a
small probe in July 1995. In December 1995, they arrive at Jupiter.
   There, the probe will parachute into the atmosphere and make
measurements until the planet's intense heat and pressure vaporize
it. The orbiter will photograph and study Jupiter and its major
moons until late 1997, circling the planet instead of flying past
it like the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft.

   Flutist James Galway was hospitalized Monday
with inflammation of the intestinal tract, forcing him to cancel
his first performance in an opera, it was announced.
   Despite feeling ill, Galway had planned up until Monday morning
to go ahead with his performance as the title character in the
Opera Company of Philadelphia production of Rossini's ``The
Thieving Magpie,'' said Jane Grey Nemeth, the company's acting
general director.
   He was admitted to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital as a
precaution, Ms. Nemeth said.
   Galway was treated with intravenous antibiotics for an
inflammation of the intestinal tract, said hospital spokeswoman
Betsy Samuels. He was in stable condition Monday night.
   Galway's doctors don't anticipate operating on the flutist, who
should recover in seven to 10 days, Ms. Sameuls said. He should be
able to immediately return to performing, she said.
   Sitting in for Galway in what would have been his operatic debut
was his wife, Jeanne.
   In Gioacchino Rossini's original production, the part of the
Magpie is generally played by a walk-on actor, but in the
Philadelphia production, a flute player takes the part.
   In the opera, the Magpie steals a silver spoon, and a servant
girl is blamed and sentenced to death. But the true culprit is
discovered at the end.

<HEAD>British Tubes Maker Says Iraq Deal Also Involved Space Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUDREY WOODS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of the steel tubes suspected to
be parts of a huge Iraqi weapon said Monday its contract with Iraq
involved Space Research Corp., which designed a satellite launch
system and was run by slain American ballistics expert Gerald Bull.
   Customs seized the eight sections April 12 as they were to be
shipped to Iraq, and insist they could be used as part of a large
gun. Sheffield Forgemasters has insisted they were for use in a
petrochemical installation and not subject to the licensing
controls that bar sales of armaments to Iraq.
   Forgemasters' lawyer Stuart Benson said in a statement Monday,
``All documents I have seen support Forgemasters' understanding
that the pipes were for a petrochemical application.
   ``It has always been accepted by Forgemasters that Space
Research Corp. had involvement in this contract. Forgemasters has
never sought to conceal such involvement.''
   He said a Dr. Cowley, not Bull, was the Space Research
representative in the contract with the Iraqi Ministry of Trade.
Space Research has its headquarters in Brussels.
   Customs said there was no question the tubes could be used as a
barrel of a large artillery piece to fire a projectile. It holds
the tubes pending investigation.
   Benson said it was not for Forgemasters to prove or disprove the
ultimate use and purpose of the tubes.
   ``My only concern is to rebut any suggestion that it has acted
in any way improperly or unlawfully,'' he said.
   Bull, 62, a Canadian-born U.S. citizen, was slain in Brussels
March 22. Belgian police said he was shot twice in the head with a
silenced gun and robbery was not the motive because $20,000 was
found in Bull's pockets.
   Bull's company was described as a multinational dealing in space
and military research and employed in international arms sales.
   Sheffield Forgemasters says it agreed to supply 52 sections of
the steel tubing and had delivered 44 to the Ministry of Industry
and Minerals in Baghdad. It denied the eight tubes seized last week
could be joined together to form a huge gun to attack Iraq's Middle
East enemies or launch satellites.
   Iraq says the tubes are petrochemical pipes.
   On Saturday, Press Association, the British domestic news
agency, quoted unidentified ``reliable government sources'' as
saying they had correspondence linking British industry with Bull's
firm.
   The correspondence refers to orders for the manufacture of
smoothbore pipes that experts believe match the specification
detailed in Bull's design for a space satellite launch system, the
sources were quoted as saying.
   The Times of London on Friday quoted an unidentified Customs
official as saying the seized materials matched a design by Bull.
Jane's Defense Weekly has identified Bull as a designer of South
Africa's G5 155mm howitzer, which has been sold to Iraq.
   On March 28, British Customs officers arrested five people at
Heathrow Airport and seized 40 U.S.-made components for nuclear
bomb triggers that were being shipped to Iraq. One of those
arrested was deported, one was released and three await trial.

   The leader of a cult pleaded innocent
Monday to murder and kidnapping charges in the execution-style
shooting deaths of a couple and their three children.
   Two cult followers also pleaded innocent in the slayings of
Dennis Avery, his wife Cheryl and their three daughters, whose
bodies were found in a common grave under a barn in nearby Kirtland.
   Altogether, 13 cult members are charged in the slayings,
believed to have taken place in April 1989.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, pleaded innocent to five counts of
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping, and the judge
ordered him held without bond. Lundgren also pleaded innocent to
one count of complicity in attempted aggravated murder lodged in a
separate indictment.
   Lundgren was defrocked about two years ago as a lay minister of
the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in
Kirtland after he espoused radical beliefs.
   He and the 12 others, including his wife and son, lived
commune-style on the farm he rented near Kirtland, about 30 miles
east of Cleveland.
   The Averys belonged to the cult but didn't live with the
Lundgrens.
   Authorities have said the Averys were considered less devout
than the other cult members and speculated they may have been
killed as a sacrificial ``cleansing'' of the spirit.
   Authorities also have said the Averys may have been slain out of
fear they would tell others of an alleged cult plan to storm a
Kirtland temple and kill people near it. No such raid occurred.
   Lake County Public Defender Paul LaPlante declined to discuss
potential defense strategy.
   Another cult member, Daniel Kraft, 25, pleaded innocent to five
counts of aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping. He was
ordered held without bond.
   Kathryn Johnson, 36, entered innocent pleas to five counts of
complicity in aggravated murder and one count of complicity in
attempted aggravated murder. Bail was set at $300,000.
   None of the three spoke at the hearings.
   The three had fought extradition from San Diego since their
arrests there in January. They were returned to Painesville on
Friday.
   Also Monday, two cult members were freed from the Lake County
Jail after their charges were reduced.
   Dennis and Tonya Patrick each had been charged with five counts
of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. Each posted 10 percent
of a $25,000 bond on one count of complicity in attempted
aggravated murder.

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' edged NBC's ``The Cosby
Show'' as prime-time ratings champ in the just-concluded 1989-1980
season, NBC announced Monday.
   ABC's Tuesday comedy starring Roseanne Barr averaged a 23.3
rating, two-tenths of a ratings point more than the Bill Cosby
family comedy which has been first in the Nielson ratings for the
last four seasons.
   ``The Cosby Show,'' wound up in second place for the season.
Cosby's series has been on the air for six seasons, and Barr's
series for two.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   Final figures for the 30-week season, which ended Sunday, won't
be available until Tuesday.
   But network research analysts say that NBC will easily win its
fifth consecutive season, with ABC coming in second, and
once-dominant CBS in third place for the third straight season.
   Still awaiting final figures for the last three days of the
season, Preston Beckman, NBC vice-president for research, said that
NBC thus far had a 14.6 ratings average, ABC a 12.9 and CBS a 12.2
during the season.
   NBC's ratings are down by nine percent, ABC's are flat, and
those of CBS are down by three percent, he said. He cited
competition from cable, the fledgling Fox network, and independent
stations as factors in the overall ratings drop.
   However, he attributed 25 percent of NBC's decline to the
absence of three sports events it had in prime time during the
previous season _ the Summer Olypmics, the World Series and pro
football's Superbowl.

<HEAD>Argentina to Lay Off 80,000 Public Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICENTE F. LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina's public works
minister, Roberto Dromi, said Monday that about 80,000 public
employees will be retired or laid off by the end of the month as an
austerity measure.
   Government workers past retirement age or within two years of
retirement are affected. Employees who hold two jobs in the state
sector must give up one. ``Employees who are in position to be
retired are going to receive their pensions and be retired,'' Dromi
said in an interview broadcast by Radio Rivadavia.
   Such action has been rare in Argentina since the late President
Juan Peron came to power in 1946. Peron entrenched himself by
creating or expanding state companies in part to spur employment
and improve working conditions. Peronist provincial governments
still expand public rolls during bad economic times.
   Argentina returned to democracy in December 1983, after nearly
eight years of harsh military rule, but the economy has been in
constant trouble for decades.
   Dromi said the public sector amounts to about 3 million of the
12{ million total workforce. Argentina's total population is about
31 million.
   ``The public administration is absolutely too big,'' Alberto
Kohan, a key aide to President Carlos Menem, told reporters.
   The government announced on March 4 that it was planning job
cutbacks and tax increases to slash the budget deficit by $2
billion. It put no figure on forced retirements and layoffs until
Dromi's comments.
   Retirement clauses in collective bargaining contracts vary from
ages 55 to 65.
   A recession has idled up to 15 percent of the workforce and
shrunk wages for many workers to $100 or less a month. Many rely on
overtime or a second job to make ends meet.
   Initial comments from labor leaders were cautious. Victor de
Gennaro, secretary-general of the 145,000-member Association of
State Workers, said the measure ``won't serve to lower public
spending'' because more employees would be suspended with pay than
retired.
   ``The retirements won't improve the functioning of the state. On
the contrary, capable people will be lost,'' he told the private
news agency Noticias Argentinas.
   Union leaders supported Menem, a Peronist, during his election
campaign last year. However, many have protested since he took
office last July that his policies of budget austerity and economic
reform have hurt union members.
   Menem drastically increased public service rates, freed wages
and prices, opened the oil industry to foreign investment and put
state companies up for sale in an attempt to reduce the fiscal
deficit.
   The deficit, for years covered by the Central Bank's printing
currency, is a prime cause of inflation that soared by 95 percent
in March and 20,266 percent the past 12 months.
   The forced retirements are almost certain to provoke a labor
reaction. Unions representing oilfield and train workers, bank
clerks and others have staged strikes or job actions this year to
protest layoffs.
   Shrinking the public payroll is seen as a major test of whether
Menem is willing to take on organized labor, long the backbone of
the Peronist party. Analysts and critics say such a confrontation
is essential and unavoidable.
   The Labor Ministry this year has asked labor courts to withdraw
the legal status of unions that strike for political, rather than
economic reasons.
   Last week, about 70 members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers were fired for participating in a strike the ministry
ruled illegal.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Harold Ford told a federal court
Monday that he has decided not to call any defense witnesses in his
trial on charges he took political payoffs from bankers.
   ``We're going to send it to the jury and let the jury decide,''
Ford said as he left the courtroom where he has been on trial since
Feb. 12.
   The 44-year-old Memphis Democrat is being tried on charges of
conspiracy, bank fraud and mail fraud. He is accused of taking
payoffs from former Tennessee bankers Jake and brother C.H. Butcher
Jr.
   Prosecutors surprised defense lawyers and courtroom spectators
last week by resting their case without calling C.H. Butcher, who
had been expected to be a star witness against Ford.
   Butcher, charged with Ford in 1987, has pleaded guilty to
conspiring with him to commit bank and mail fraud.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Clancy declined to comment on his
decision not to summon Butcher.
   Ford is being tried with three former Butcher aides: accountant
David Crabtree and laywers Douglas Beaty and Karl Schledwitz.
   The congressman's co-defendants also announced they were ready
to turn the case over the jury following final arguments.
   Before resting their case, defense lawyers asked U.S. District
Judge Odell Horton for a direct verdict of acquittal, saying the
prosecution had fallen well short of proving its case. Horton
denied the motion.
   Defense and prosecution lawyers are scheduled to discuss
procedural matters Tuesday afternoon with Horton. Final arguments
are expected to begin Wednesday.
   Government lawyers called 29 witnesses who outlined a
complicated series of loans to Ford from lending institutions once
run by the Butchers.
   Most of those loans were without collateral or adequate
financial statements, and Ford made few if any payments on them
until the Butchers' banking empire collapsed in 1983, witnesses
said.
   The Butchers set off the largest banking collapse in Tennessee
history and are serving 20-year bank fraud sentences in federal
prison.
   Government witnesses said Ford's loans were moved from bank to
bank, apparently to hide them from federal examiners. Many of the
loans eventually ended up at C.H. Butcher's Southern Industrial
Banking Corp., a state-chartered finance company.
   A federal bank examiner described SIBC as a ``dumping ground''
for bad loans issued by the Butchers.
   The government says Ford got some $1 million in Butcher loans
between 1976 and 1982, but he puts the loan total at $650,000. Ford
said the loans have been settled since 1983.
   He paid a bankruptcy trustee $25,000 in 1983 to settle his
obligations stemming from a $350,000 loan from SIBC to a company
called Tenn-Ford Inc.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose 1988 arrest on charges she
tried to kill the head of a medical company galvanized the animal
rights movement pleaded no contest Monday in exchange for a reduced
one-year prison sentence.
   Although she strongly contested the case against her, Fran
Trutt, 33, pleaded no contest to attempted murder, possession of
explosives and bomb manufacturing, said her attorney, John Williams.
   Trutt was arrested in November 1988 after a remote-controlled
pipe bomb was found near the parking space of Leon Hirsch, chairman
of U.S. Surgical Corp. in Norwalk.
   Animal-rights activists had criticized U.S. Surgical for using
anesthetized dogs to train physicians how to use surgical staples
in place of stitches. The dogs are then killed.
   Under the plea bargain reached late Monday afternoon, Trutt will
serve one year in prison followed by three years of probation as
part of a 10-year suspended sentence.
   Trutt, who lived in New York City when she was arrested, has
been held on $500,000 bond at the Connecticut Correctional Center
in Niantic.
   In pleading no contest, she resisted any suggestion that she was
guilty. Instead, she accused Hirsch of murdering dogs.
   ``I disagree completely with guilt. The evidence we needed to
prove has not come up yet,'' Trutt told Stamford Superior Court
Judge Joette Katz.
   As Katz reviewed the charges, Trutt said, ``The one who was
guilty of that is Hirsch.''
   Animal-rights activists and Trutt claimed she was set up by the
company to discredit their movement.
   U.S. Surgical said Trutt's conviction vindicated the company.
   ``Her convictions should send a clear message to animal-rights
activists that they can protest, that they can disagree and they
can picket peacefully, but the American system of justice will
pursue vigorously those who attempt to force their views on others
through violence,'' said company spokeswoman Marianne Scipione.
   The pleas discredit the entrapment argument, Ms. Scipione said.
   The plea bargain was similar to one that fell through April 5.
   In the earlier agreement, Trutt would have pleaded no contest to
at least one of the charges against her in exchange for a one-year
sentence and the right to visit her four dogs. But when prison
officials denied Trutt the dog-visitation rights, she opted for a
trial, Williams said.
   Williams said Trutt decided on the plea bargain because the
prosecution was prepared to introduce tape recordings of her
discussing details of her sex life and the murder attempt.
   ``The sex tapes _ I think that's what did it. It was just
disgusting,'' Williams said after Monday's hearing in state
Superior Court in Stamford. ``I have been fearing this from the
first day: How long will Fran be able to stand up to this?''
   The tapes were of telephone conversations between Trutt and Mary
Lou Sapone, who was hired by U.S. Surgical to befriend Trutt and
spy on her, Williams said.
   The case was in the pretrial stage when Monday's agreement was
reached.
   Trutt could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison on
the attempted murder charge alone.

   Mario Vargas Llosa said Monday he will
continue his presidential campaign and participate in an election
runoff against Alberto Fujimori, a political neophyte now favored
to win Peru's presidency.
   ``I will go to the second round fighting for the reforms that
our country needs,'' the celebrated novelist said in a brief
statement following a two-hour meeting with campaign strategists
and leaders of his center-right Democratic Front coalition.
   Vargas Llosa said he had been ready to end his candidacy to save
Peru the turmoil of two more months of election campaigning but was
persuaded to continue for the good of this Andean nation, wracked
by economic problems and a violent guerrilla uprising.
   He had been seriously considering dropping out of the runoff
election after a disappointing showing in the April 8 opening
round, according to key figures in his campaign.
   Fujimori, the descendent of Japanese immigrants and a political
unknown when he started the campaign, ran a close second to Vargas
Llosa and has emerged as a favorite in the runoff because he is
expected to pick up the support of voters who favored leftist
candidates.
   Vargas Llosa said a major factor in his decision was the
constitutional requirement for a runoff if no candidate receives a
majority of votes, effectively barring by law from withdrawing his
name from the second round.
   That appeared to confirm reports he was participating in the
runoff, expected to be held in late May or early June, to fulfill a
legal requirement and was not enthusiastic about continuing his
presidential campaign.
   Key supporters said the novelist had been considering dropping
out because he was reportedly discouraged by the prospect that he
would lose the runoff or, if he won, face the prospect of governing
the country without control of Congress.
   Vargas Llosa, author of such celebrated books as ``The Green
House,'' ``Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter'' and ``Converations in
The Cathedral,'' went into seclusion with his family last Wednesday
to mull over the decision on whether to continue the race.
   He said Monday night hoped the second round of campaigning would
produce a ``clean debate'' on the best ways to solve Peru's
problems.
   News commentators and political figures close to the writer had
said earlier Monday they were convinced he would stay in the race.
   Some of Vargas Llosa's closest supporters have stressed the need
for a runoff to ensure that Peru's next president can claim a
popular mandate to deal with the country's problems.
   Due to the growing violence by the Shining Path guerrillas and
the country's severe economic problems, Peru needs a president
elected with majority support, Manuel d'Ornellas, editor of the
Expreso newspaper and a close friend of the writer, said last week.
   ``The mandate that Fujimori would receive after Vargas Llosa's
resignation could be questioned in the future, opening the doors to
a possible military coup,'' d'Ornellas wrote in a column in his
paper.
   Fujimori had been given little chance of making the second round
a month ago. But a late surge propelled him into second place in
the field of nine candidates.
   Vargas Llosa had hoped for a majority to avoid a second round
but received only 32 percent of the votes. Fujimori, an
agricultural engineer and former university rector running as an
independent, received nearly 30 percent.
   Fujimori is favored in the runoff because Vargas Llosa is
unlikely to receive support from the left-of-center ruling Aprista
Party and Peru's leftist parties.
   Vargas Llosa harshly criticized the leftists' policies, while
Fujimori conducted a conciliatory campaign.
   Fujimori avoided specifics in his campaign, stressing instead
general goals like improved health care and revitalized industry.
   Analysts say Fujimori also benefited from voter concerns about
the harsh economic austerity measures advocated by Varsa Llosa and
suspicions about the old-line politicians in the Democratic Front.
   The Democratic Front also fell far short of gaining a majority
in the congressional elections.
   Without support in Congress, Vargas Llosa would have great
problems as president imposing his economic austerity program aimed
at reviving Peru's moribund economy.

   A property clerk at a state hospital
for the criminally insane was fatally attacked Monday while working
with a patient, who was arrested in the slaying, officials said.
   The 59-year-old victim, whose name was withheld until his
relatives could be notified, was pronounced dead of head injuries
at Twin Cities Hospital in Templeton shortly before noon, said a
statement from Atascadero State Hospital.
   Terry Caylor, 43, was arrested for investigation of murder, said
San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Lt. Pat Hedges.
   Details of the attack were sketchy, and Atascadero spokesman
David Hamilton said the hospital would not elaborate pending an
investigation by the district attorney's office and sheriff's
department.
   According to the central California hospital's statement, the
patient had been working with the property clerk when the clerk was
unexpectedly attacked.
   Atascadero's acting executive director, Dr. Gordon Gritter,
``expressed deep sympathy for the family, and reflected the shock
of all the hospital employees,'' the release said. ``He also stated
the great dismay of all who have been working to improve safety at
the hospital.''
   The last violent incident at the 891-patient hospital involved
an attack on a female technician in March 1989, Hamilton said. A
patient is being prosecuted in that attack, he said.
   The hospital is one of two facilities in California that handle
patients deemed by the courts to be mentally disordered and unfit
for criminal prosecution.

<HEAD>Escobar Leadership of Medellin Cartel Thrown Into Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Medellin drug cartel rejects its
longtime leader, Pablo Escobar, because of his indiscriminate
terrorism, according to a statement claiming to be from cartel
members.
   The newspaper El Tiempo on Monday doubted the the statement's
authenticity. It said the format and lettering were different from
previous documents sent by the traffickers to local media.
   Defense Minister Oscar Botero said Monday he did not know if the
statement was authentic, but that a split in the cartel does exist
over tactics in a battle against the government.
   ``There are many drug traffickers,'' Botero said in a TV
interview broadcast by the Cinevision news program, adding that
some members of the Medellin Cartel were opposed to terrorist
violence.
   The statement was issued Sunday night and declared:
   ``We the Extraditables do not agree with the terrorist acts that
Pablo Escobar is ordering in an indiscriminate and personal way.
Previously we asked Pablo Escobar to stop detonating bombs and
executing innocent people because such acts did not help our cause.
   ``From now on, we declare ourselves in total disagreement with
the terrorist acts ordered personally by Pablo Escobar. We reject
the violent way (Escobar) is forcing us to carry on his personal
war by kidnapping, torturing and threatening our families.''
   Authorities have blamed the Medellin Cartel for a campaign of
bombings and other terrorist violence that killed 238 people in the
last eight months.
   The attacks were in retaliation for a government crackdown in
which 15 drug suspects were extradited and hundreds of traffickers'
properties seized.
   Last month the cartel ended a unilateral truce declared in
January. It said the renewed violence was in reply to continued
government pressure on them.
   In two weeks, terrorists killed 28 police officers in Medellin.
On April 5, police defused a 1,650-pound dynamite truck bomb on a
main avenue in Bogota during morning rush hour. Authorities say the
bomb could have killed thousands.
   Authorities blamed the Medellin cartel for all the attacks. The
statement makes it appear that Escobar may have acted alone.
   Police dispatched 300 anti-terrorist agents to Medellin to
search for Escobar, who they say has undergone plastic surgery to
evade authorities.
   Police sources say Escobar's capture, dead or alive, is imminent
since he is losing organization support. Authorities say Escobar
has killed and tortured cartel members suspected of betraying him.

<TEXT>
   Despite a merchants' strike that shut down
the city's famed Chinatown, the Board of Supervisors voted Monday
to tear down a quake-damaged freeway the merchants consider a vital
link to their community.
   Almost 1,200 shops, restaurants and professional offices _ all
but five small businesses _ signed up to take part in the
three-hour shutdown, said protest organizer Rose Pak of the Chinese
Chamber of Commerce.
   Many of the business people attended the meeting at which the
supervisors considered a proposal by Mayor Art Agnos to consider
replacing the elevated Embarcadero Freeway with either a surface or
underground road.
   The board voted 6-5 to accept Agnos' proposal. The state
Department of Transportation previously agreed to abide by the
supervisors' vote on the state-owned freeway.
   Supervisor Angela Alioto said the vote means the freeway that
runs along the waterfront will have to be torn down, but Pak vowed
to continue the fight and hold state officials to a plan to repair
the road.
   The strike began at 1:30 p.m. and Chinatown came to a grinding
halt. Most stores closed, with shopkeepers taking their goods off
the sidewalks.
   The usual shoulder-to-shoulder pedestrian traffic in the heart
of Chinatown went away. The noise of car horns was replaced by the
sound of chimes blowing in the breeze.
   ``We just got in to Chinatown and already got kicked out of two
shops,'' said Michael Kiriazis, a businessman from Portland, Ore.,
just as the strike began.
   Hundreds of Chinatown business people and residents climbed
aboard buses that shuttled them to City Hall.
   It has stood empty since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook
northern California six months ago, killing 68 people, cracking
concrete columns supporting the waterfront roadway.
   Agnos recently proposed tearing down the elevated freeway, long
considered an eyesore as well as an easy entrance for drivers into
Chinatown and the restaurants of North Beach and tourist
attractions at Fisherman's Wharf. In its place, the mayor suggested
building an underground road that he believes would be safer from
earthquakes and more aesthetically pleasing.
   But Pak and others such as Supervisor Tom Hsieh contend
repairing the existing freeway would be better because it would get
business traffic back into the economically depressed Chinatown
area sooner and cheaper.
   The Agnos plan calls for expenditures of about $120 million,
mostly in federal funds, over four years. Repairing the old
freeway, however, would cost the state transportation department
about $32 million to wrap the structure's support columns in
2-inch-thick steel jackets, making it able to withstanding an
8.3-magnitude quake. Under that plan, the freeway would reopen by
October.
   Time is essential to Chinatown merchants. While Deputy Mayor
James Ho estimated business in that area is down by 8 percent, Pak
placed the loss closer to 30 percent for tourist-dependent
businesses and 20 percent for those relying on local residents.
   She said the community is united behind the repair plan.
   ``This is the first time in 205 years the Chinese community has
shut down their businesses to protest,'' Pak said.
   While Chinatown initiated its protest action, the San Francisco
Chronicle ran a column by 1990 Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture
critic Allan Temko, headlined: ``Freeway Must Go for the City to
Thrive.''
   Temko argued for a buried freeway, and said San Francisco could
once again be the ``beau ideal of a civilized American metropolis,
as it was before the freeway transformed one of the loveliest
waterfronts in the world into one of the most obscene.''

   The killings of five cab drivers in the Bronx,
including three who may have been victims of the same robber, have
terrorized hundreds of drivers who are sacrificing profits for
daytime driving.
   At the Seaman Car Service, employer of the latest victim, black
flags flew Monday from the antennas of cabs, and drivers held a
memorial procession.
   At the Flash Car Service Co. in the Bronx, only 15 of the 80
drivers who normally work Sunday nights showed up for work, said
dispatcher Pablo Feliciano.
   ``Most of them are switching to the days,'' Feliciano said.
``They're really disturbed about what's going on. Everybody's
shaken up really badly.''
   Drivers again vented their outrage later Monday when 400 to 500
cabs descended on a section of the Bronx and tied up traffic after
hearing a false report on their radios that another driver had been
shot, said Officer Fred Weiner.
   With lights on, the cabs parked in the street and blocked
traffic from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., said Weiner, a police spokesman.
   ``A canvass of the car service companies did not turn up any
drivers missing,'' Weiner said. ``They caused a major traffic jam
over there.''
   The latest killing Saturday and another three days earlier were
dismissed by police as unrelated to the first three, but the
slayings heightened fears in an area where cab drivers haven't felt
safe for decades.
   Officer James Terretta, part of a task force of about 30
officers investigating the slayings, said police do not have a
suspect in any of the killings but are receiving many tips.
   Mayor David Dinkins has offered a $10,000 reward for information
leading to the killer or killers.
   The terror spree began March 7 with the death of Acton Jones,
37. On March 14, 43-year-old Eliot Whitaker was killed, and on
April 9, Paul Burghard, 25, was fatally shot.
   In each shooting, a man phoned a car service requesting a cab,
then killed the drivers with a shot to the head from a .22-caliber
gun and robbed them.
   Last Wednesday, Dennis Forbes, 41, the driver of an unlicensed
cab, was shot in the head and killed before he had a chance to use
a .25-caliber pistol police said he kept on the seat next to him.
   Late Saturday, Rafael Montes De Oca, 38, of the Seaman Car
Service was shot in the head and killed after he went to pick up a
regular customer.
   ``The first three are connected and the last two are not,'' said
Officer Ralph St. Just, a police spokesman. He said investigators
refused to explain why.
   In New York City, there are four basic types of taxicabs. Yellow
cabs, also known as medallion cabs, roam the streets of the borough
of Manhattan and airports, picking up passengers at random.
   Car services, or so-called livery cars, generally operate
outside Manhattan and are dispatched in response to customer calls.
``Black cars'' are used almost exclusively by corporate clients who
arrange their pickups. Then there are thousands of unlicensed cabs
which ply the streets.
   The number of car services grew in the 1960s and 1970s when
yellow cab drivers began avoiding the outer boroughs where they
felt less safe and where there generally was no customer to return
with to Manhattan.
   Cars are dispatched from 120 bases in the Bronx but some
companies have lost up to 80 percent of their drivers at night
because of fear caused by the deaths, said Tony Carter, a spokesman
for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which licenses cabs in the
city.
   Customers calling cabs in the Bronx now wait an hour or more for
a car that used to be at their doorstep in 10 to 20 minutes, he
said.
   Last year, 32 cab drivers were killed, about half of them in the
Bronx, said Officer Kim Royster, a police spokeswoman. Citywide,
3,032 cabbies were robbed last year.
   There are 11,787 yellow cabs, 35,000 livery cabs and up to
20,000 unlicensed cabs in the city.
   Of the 1989 deaths, 28 were livery drivers and four were
medallion drivers, the spokeswoman said.

   A bomb inside an envelope addressed to
``tax thieves'' exploded outside a post office Monday night,
injuring a worker taking last-minute federal tax returns,
authorities said.
   The worker, whose name wasn't released, was taken to William
Beaumont Hospital suffering from burns on his hands and face, said
city Fire Chief Bill Crouch.
   The 29-year-old victim was treated and released, said hospital
spokeswoman Valerie Mabaczek, who declined to discuss the man's
injuries. ``He asked that no information be given out.''
   The blast occurred around 8:30 p.m. outside the post office in
this Detroit suburb as workers collected tax returns.
   Workers spotted the envelope, which had been placed in a bin,
smoking. The victim had picked it up to put it in a puddle when it
went off, Crouch said.
   The envelope was addressed to ``tax thieves'' and contained at
least one tea bag, the fire chief said.
   The blast did little or no structural damage to the post office,
said police Lt. Ray Taylor.
   The FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents and the state police bomb squad responded to the bombing,
Taylor said. The bomb squad was called out to make sure there were
no other bombs.
   No suspects were in custody, Taylor said.

<HEAD>Three Pulitzers Honor Reporting on Health Threats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers that warned readers of health threats
in drinking water, blood supplies and a dietary supplement won
Pulitzer Prizes on April 12. Two papers won for their coverage of
the California earthquake.
   Public service Pulitzers were awarded to the Washington (N.C.)
Daily News for an expose of carcinogens in the city water supply,
and to The Philadelphia Inquirer for a probe of the blood industry.
   Reporting on a third health threat, the link between the dietary
supplement L-tryptophan and a rare blood disorder, won the Pulitzer
for specialized reporting for Tamar Stieber of the Albuquerque
(N.M.) Journal.
   The staff of the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, which published
with the aid of emergency generators after the Oct. 17 quake, won
the general news award for its coverage of the disaster.
   The spot news photography award went to the photo staff of The
Tribune of Oakland, Calif., for pictures of the earthquake's
devastation.
   The award for international reporting went to Nicholas D.
Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn of The New York Times, a husband-and-wife
team who covered the mass movement for democracy in China and its
suppression.
   David C. Turnley of the Detroit Free Press won the feature
photography prize for his coverage of the political tumult in China
and Eastern Europe.
   Announcement of the awards set off celebrations around the
country.
   ``I always thought Pulitzers were for overturning a government
or exposing a scandal in the stock market,'' said Los Angeles Times
sports columnist Jim Murray, who won the prize for commentary. ``I
thought Walter Lippmann got Pulitzers, not us guys.''
   ``I will say we haven't had this much excitement in this town
since the Union cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each
other up Main Street in 1862, and there's been nothing like that
since,'' said Bill Coughlin, the Washington Daily News' executive
editor.
   The Daily News revealed that carcinogens had been in the water
supply for eight years, and that the local government had neither
disclosed the problem nor corrected it.
   They broke out the champagne at the Inquirer, which won for
reporter Gilbert M. Gaul's series. It was the Philadelphia
newspaper's 17th Pulitzer and the 11th in the past six years.
   ``I feel great. It is a terrific honor,'' said Gaul. ``The paper
showed an incredible amount of courage to allow me to spend a year
and a half on the story and to report on a subject that is of great
importance to everyone that we don't often think about _ blood.''
   Gaul, 38, had previously won the Pulitzer Prize for
investigative reporting in 1979. The blood series, which found that
the industry is little regulated, was inspired by his questions
about what happened to the blood he donated four times a year.
   It was the first time in 23 years that two newspapers were cited
in the public service category.
   The investigative reporting award went to Lou Kilzer and Chris
Ison of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St. Paul, for their
revelation of a network of local citizens who were linked to
members of the St. Paul fire department and who profited from fires.
   The explanatory journalism award went to David A. Vise and Steve
Coll of The Washington Post for stories examining the workings of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and its former chairman,
John Shad.
   Four reporters for The Seattle Times _ Ross Anderson, Bill
Dietrich, Mary Ann Gwinn and Eric Nalder _ received the national
reporting award for their coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill
and its aftermath.
   For his feature writing award, Dave Curtin of the Colorado
Springs (Colo.) Gazette Telegraph profiled a family that was
struggling to recover from an explosion that devastated their home
and left them severely burned.
   Other awards included:
   _For criticism, Allan Temko of the San Francisco Chronicle.
``Did I win?'' said the architecture critic. ``Is it true? How
extraordinary. I've always been a bridesmaid.''
   _For editorial writing, Thomas J. Hylton of The Mercury of
Pottstown, Pa., who wrote editorials about a local bond issue for
the preservation of farmland and other open space in rural
Pennsylvania.
   _For editorial cartooning, Tom Toles of The Buffalo (N.Y.) News.

   Participants in an international media conference
said April 10 that new communications technology and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms have combined to open up the East
bloc to the rest of the world.
   But at least one Western journalist taking part in the 11th
World Media Conference expressed concern over the closing of
Lithuania and other restive Soviet republics to foreign reporters.
   The conference, meeting for the first time in Moscow, held a
three-day symposium to discuss the impact of political changes in
the Soviet Union on international communications.
   About 500 delegates from 60 countries, including many former
heads of state, attended the meeting of the association, which was
founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon to encourage East-West
communications.
   Allen H. Neuharth, retired chairman of Gannett Co. Inc., told an
afternoon panel discussion that advanced satellite communications
and publishing technology have opened a new window on the world.
   He said people around the world were able to watch the events
unfolding in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe on television and
read about them almost immediately in newspapers.
   Andrei Grachev, deputy director of the Communist Party Central
Committee's International Affairs Department, agreed.
   ``The 20th century began as an age of electronics, and is ending
as the age of communications,'' Grachev said.
   ``We are living in an age where secrets cannot be kept,'' he
said, citing the example of foreign scientists who detected the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and satellite intelligence on the
location of nuclear missile sites.
   Most panelists agreed that Gorbachev's policies of perestroika
and glasnost helped create the conditions for radical change in the
East bloc and the speedy reporting of events in East bloc nations.
   However, Jim Laurie, Moscow bureau chief for ABC News, noted
that in cases of unrest, several republics had been closed to
foreign reporters. Recently, Western journalists were ordered out
of Lithuania after the republic declared its independence.
   The absence of foreign journalists could lead to partisan
manipulation of the media by means of circulating stories that
could not be independently checked, Laurie said.
   Among the delegates attending the conference were Arthur A.
Hartman, former U.S. ambassador to Moscow; Joseph Luns, former NATO
secretary-general; Raul Alfonsin, former president of Argentina;
Alfonso Michelsen, former president of Colombia; and Jihan Sadat,
widow of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
   Representatives from the Soviet Union included Andrei Grachev,
deputy director of International Affairs; Vadim Zagladin, adviser
to Gorbachev; economist Abel Aganbegyan; Nikolai Vorontsov,
chairman of the State Committee for Protection of the Environment;
and Ivan Ivanov, deputy chairman of the International Economic
Commission.
   Media representatives included Allen H. Neuharth, founder of USA
Today; Bo Hi Pak, publisher of The Washington Times and president
of the World Media Association; and Arnaud de Borchgrave,
editor-in-chief of The Washington Times.

<HEAD>Bush's Broccoli Ban Well Known to Public, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's distaste for broccoli has
received nearly six times as much public attention as Earth Day,
according to a surve of people's attentiveness to the news.
   The Times Mirror Center for The People and The Press said April
11 that its interviewers asked 1,212 people age 18 and older what
vegetable it is that Bush recently said he wouldn't eat.
   Seventy-six percent said broccoli, the right answer. Four
percent named some other vegetable. The rest refused to answer or
said they didn't know.
   By contrast, 13 percent knew that April 22 is being observed as
Earth Day to honor the environment. Fifteen percent gave a wrong
answer and 72 percent said they didn't know when asked what was
special about the date.
   The survey also found, for the fifth month in a row, that
Americans paid more attention to foreign news than domestic news.
   The organization listed 18 news stories and asked people which
was the most important.
   Forty percent cited an international story, with 21 percent
naming Lithuanian independence. Also mentioned were other political
developments in the Soviet Union, Germany and elsewhere in Eastern
and Central Europe. Two percent named the release of black leader
Nelson Mandela from a South African prison.
   Four percent mentioned domestic stories, including oil spills,
the NCAA basketball playoffs, the death of 87 people in a fire at a
social club in New York and the attempt in Idaho to pass a bill
that would severely restrict abortions.
   Ten percent named stories not on the list, 43 percent said they
didn't know and 2 percent refused to answer. This adds up to only
99 percent because the percentages were rounded to the nearest full
number.
   The survey results are based on telephone interviews conducted
under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates from
April 5-8, with the 1,212 respondents interviewed by The Gallup
Organization. The results are subject to a sampling error of plus
or minus three percentage points.
   The Times Mirror Center for The People and The Press is an arm
of Times Mirror Corp., which owns the Los Angeles Times and other
publishing and broadcasting enterprises.

<HEAD>Hearst President Warns Against Recyling Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laws mandating the use of recycled
newsprint will slow progress toward recycling rather than speed it
up, the president and chief executive of The Hearst Corp. said
April 11.
   Frank Bennack Jr., who is chairman of an American Newspaper
Publishers Association task force on recycling, said such laws
could cause the severe disruption of the newspaper and newsprint
production industries.
   ``Society cannot legislate solutions to what are basically
economic problems,'' he said. ``Only a free market can produce
solutions to economic problems that are effective and efficient.''
   Bennack received the Rochester Institute of Technology's Isaiah
Thomas Award for outstanding contributions to the newspaper
publishing industry.
   About 35 percent of all used newsprint is recycled, Bennack said.
   ``There is obviously much room for improvement in those
statistics,'' he said. ``And there is agreement that it can and
will be done.''
   But Bennack said the conversion must be voluntary.
   There is a shortage of recycled newsprint because most paper
mills are not equipped to handle recycling, Bennack said.
   Laws mandating recycling, such as those in California and
Connecticut, could cause imbalances and shortages in other parts of
the country, he said. Bennack said he also opposes such regulations
in principle because ``regulated newsprint is typical of a
non-democratic society.''
   Instead, Bennack said there should be more voluntary agreements
by publishers to increase their use of recycled newsprint. He
called for efforts by the states to make used newsprint available
and encourage the construction of recycling plants.

<HEAD>Journalist Charged With Computer Hacking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A freelance journalist pleaded innocent April
6 to charges that he used a computer in an effort to steal
information from a TV tabloid show.
   Stuart Goldman, 44, was charged with seven felony counts of
violating a California Penal Code section prohibiting unauthorized
access to computers.
   Goldman allegedly used another person's access code to enter a
computer used by the Fox Television show ``A Current Affair'' at
the network's Hollywood television station, KTTV, said Sandi
Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
   Information was allegedly taken out of the computer through a
telephone connection and stored in Goldman's home computer.
   Last month, federal prosecutors filed an affidavit in U.S.
District Court in New York stating that the reporter had tried to
gain access to computer files concerning news stories that Fox
reporters were working on.
   Prosecutors dropped the New York case without comment.
   Goldman briefly worked for ``A Current Affair'' as well as
``Hard Copy,'' a competitor's show. He has written articles for
National Review magazine, the Los Angeles Times and other
publications.
   If convicted of all the state charges, Goldman could be
sentenced to a maximum of six years in prison.

<HEAD>Paper Says Its Meeting May Have Violated State Sunshine Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bradenton Herald reported that a
meeting between representatives of the paper and four city council
members April 9 to discuss newspaper rack regulations may have
violated the state's open government law.
   The council members met with Herald Publisher Dorothy Ridings
and four other employees at the newspaper's offices at the Herald's
invitation. The meeting was called to discuss how area newspapers
could address the council's concerns about newspaper rack placement
and appearance, said General Manager Robert Turner, one of those
present.
   In December, Herald representatives requested that the council
delay voting on an ordinance regulating newspaper racks. City
officials gave the newspaper three months to come up with possible
alternatives to the proposed ordinance.
   Florida's Sunshine Law prohibits public officials from
conducting business in private meetings.
   The state's courts have held that the law applies to any
gathering of two or more members of the same board, and that it is
applicable when board members are discussing any matter on which
action might be taken.
   Ridings said she did not realize at the time that the meeting
might have violated the law.
   ``If anyone should have realized it, I should have,'' she said.
``All I can do is apologize to the public and our colleagues for
putting us and them in an embarrassing situation.''
   Council members said they thought the media had been invited to
the session, and that there was no intent to break the law.

<HEAD>McDonald's Warns Papers Against Critical Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for McDonald's Corp. have written
letters to newspapers advising them not to publish advertisements
from an anti-cholesterol crusader who launched a national campaign
earlier this month.
   Phil Sokolof placed ads in newspapers April 4 asking McDonald's
to lower the amount of saturated fat on its menu. The ads,
headlined ``The Poisoning of America!'' included a plea to
McDonald's to cut the fat in their hamburgers by 10 percent.
   McDonald's attorney Joseph Califano said April 13 the ad was
inaccurate and that newspapers did not check the facts.
   ``Now they know the facts, now they are all on notice. ... To
publish anything like that ad would be a malicious act,'' said
Califano, secretary of the department of Health, Education and
Welfare in the Carter administration.
   Sokolof said McDonald's was putting up a ``smokescreen'' and
that the ad was a public service.
   ``McDonald's has chosen to try and intimidate the nation's
leading newspapers,'' said Sokolof, who blames a bad diet for a
heart attack he suffered years ago. He would not rule out placing
more ads in the future.
   McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling said the ad overstated the
saturated fat content of McDonald's products, including an
assertion that McDonald's precooked hamburger meat is 21.5 percent
fat.
   ``In reality, the fat content before cooking is 17 to 20 percent
fat and is typically 19.5 percent fat,'' Ebeling said.
   An official of a Washington, D.C.-based consumer advocacy group,
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said either way the
saturated fat levels in fast food are too high.
   ``To me, the important part is that the general thrust of the ad
was correct,'' said nutrition director Bonnie Liebman. ``Many of
the foods served at McDonald's are loaded with saturated fat and
cholesterol and eating less would reduce heart disease _ the
nation's largest killer.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Reporter Called as Defense Witness in Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter testified April 9
as a defense witness in the murder trial of a prison inmate who
claims he was insane when his former wife was beaten to death in
1989.
   Marti Goodlad Heline, the courts reporter covering the trial for
the South Bend Tribune, had been subpoenaed as a prosecution
witness. The prosecution rested its case without calling her.
   Alan L. Matheney is charged with murder and burglary in the
March 4, 1989, slaying of Lisa Marie Bianco.
   Defense attorney Scott L. King called Heline to testify about
two interviews she conducted with Matheney and three stories based
on the interviews, published in March and June 1989.
   Under King's questioning, Heline said Matheney told her he went
to Ms. Bianco's home to retrieve audio tapes recorded by Ms.
Bianco. ``He believedt a ring of
physicians performed unnecessary surgery on elderly patients for
profit.
   In the series, reporter Ed Gonzalez said Srivastava lost his
privileges to practice at Santa Rosa Hospital and the Baptist
Memorial Hospital System amid claims of unnecessary surgery.
   The doctor contended the series ruined his San Antonio practice.
His malpractice insurance skyrocketed and he was forced to move to
Midland, where he now practices at a loss, said his lawyer, James
Branton.
   KENS-TV President and General Manager Michael J. Conly said the
station was surprised at the verdict.
   ``At the same time, we know media companies frequently lose
verdicts at the jury level, for whatever reasons, but then win on
appeal because the law recognizes the crucial role the media plays
in educating the public and protecting our democratic
institutions,'' Conly said.
   The news series included interviews with family members of some
of Srivastava's patients and documentation of the suspensions.
KENS-TV stood behind the broadcast as good journalism on a subject
of great public concern.
   The station's attorney, Mark Cannan, argued that the medical
community already knew of Srivastava's hospital suspensions and,
therefore, the doctor's reputation was damaged before the first
KENS-TV story aired.
   He noted the suspensions also were reported in the San Antonio
Express-News the morning before the first broadcast.
   Cannan said the series ran over a period of several days and
Srivastava had an open invitation to appear.
   The jury found that the reports as a whole were false and ruined
the doctor's reputation. The panel also said the television station
knew the stories were false and acted with ``reckless disregard for
the truth.''

<HEAD>5 Felony Charges, 3 Misdemeanors Filed Against Hunter S. Thompson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunter S. Thompson, the dean of ``gonzo
journalism,'' was charged April 9 with possessing blasting caps and
various drugs police found after a former porn actress accused the
writer of molesting her in his home.
   Thompson, 52, pleaded innocent to three misdemeanors:
third-degree sexual assault, third-degree simple assault and
possession of marijuana.
   Those charges were based on allegations by Gail Palmer-Slater,
star of ``The Erotic Adventures of Candy,'' that Thompson threw a
drink at her, twisted her breast and shoved her during a visit at
his home Feb. 21.
   Her allegations led to a police search of Thompson's home Feb.
26 and 27. Police said they seized blasting caps and substances
they allege to be LSD, cocaine, the tranquilizer Diazepam and
marijuana.
   An April 23 hearing was set on five felony charges: three counts
of possession of a controlled substance, one charge of using
cocaine and one charge of unlawful possession of incendiary devices.
   Palmer-Slater, who lives in Port Huron, Mich., said she went to
Thompson's home in Woody Creek to discuss a business enterprise,
and claimed he became angry when she refused to conduct the
discussion in his hot tub.
   Thompson says he never assaulted the woman. He told reporters
Palmer-Slater was drunk and was pressuring him to have sex with her
when he pushed her away.
   Thompson remains free on $2,000 bond. Deputy District Attorney
Charles McCrory said Thompson could receive a maximum of 16 years
in prison if convicted of all eight charges against him.
   Thompson is the author of several books written in a style that
has come to be known as gonzo journalism, intermingling a
description of real events with exaggerated accounts of his own
involvement, which often include drug and alcohol abuse.
   Thompson ran a full-page advertisement April 9 in the Aspen
Times Daily that read: ``BEWARE. Today: the Doctor. Tomorrow:
You.'' The ad was paid for by the ``Hunter S. Thompson Legal
Defense Fund.''
   Thompson's books include ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,''
``Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail,'' ``The Great Shark
Hunt'' and ``Generation of Swine,'' a compilation of some of his
newspaper and magazine columns.

<HEAD>Poland Formally Votes to End Censorship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's lawmakers on April 11 formally
ended censorship, one of the final relics of four decades of
Communist rule.
   The decision, by a 266-0 vote with eight abstentions, was
largely symbolic. Censorship has been almost non-existent since the
Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki was
voted in to power last fall.
   Solidarity deputy Juliusz Braun said censorship had actually
``allowed slandering with impunity'' without permitting a person to
defend himself.
   The censorship law allowed the former Communist authorities to
control all kinds of publications and stage and film performances,
preventing criticism of the political system.
   Many Poles turned to underground printing, which flourished
through the 1980s.
   Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent trade union,
fought for elimination of censorship since its foundation in 1980.

<HEAD>Judge Orders News Organizations to Turn Over Film of Tax Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on April 6 ordered 25 newspapers and
television stations to give police all film and photographs of a
March 31 anti-tax riot in London.
   A dozen organizations immediately opposed the order, two said
they were willing to hand over what they published and the
remaining 11 neither opposed nor consented.
   Judge Neil Denison issued the order after a day of legal
argument, ruling the film would help police and that it was in
``the overriding public interest.''
   However, he said in other cases the public interest may be
better served by allowing the news media to report events freely
and each case should be decided on its merits.
   ``It is right, as has been argued, that the court should not
automatically or routinely grant such orders,'' Denison said. ``It
should not be seen to be rubber-stamping such applications.''
   The news organizations reacted angrily.
   ``If we are seen to be a potential arm of the state, journalists
are going to be targets of the rioters,'' said TV-am news director
Jeff Berliner.
   Geoffrey Shaw, lawyer for the BBC and TV-am, argued there had
been 2,750 police officers at the poll tax demonstration.
   ``They should not require the media to be their eyes and ears.
If they want film, it is reasonable to expect them to take it
themselves,'' Shaw said.
   The riot broke out after 40,000 had gathered for a peaceful
demonstration to protest the new poll tax by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government.

   Twentieth Century Fox lifted its ban April 9
against critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, who gave harsh reviews

   The studio said three weeks earlier that they would be barred

   Siskel called Fox April 9 shortly before the screening of

and asked if he was still unwelcome.
   The ban was over, a company spokesman said, and Siskel went to

   ``I'm happy the ban is lifted,'' Ebert said. ``I feel

   The Fort Myers (Fla.) News-Press won the
Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards' $2,000 grand prize April 9 for
``Far From the Dream,'' a 12-part series on the problems of blacks
in southwestern Florida.
   The News-Press, which also received a $1,000 first prize for
print journalism, was honored for its articles last year on
housing, education, economics, politics and other problems

   President Bush will ask a 17-nation conference
this week to examine the economic impact of global warming, but the
administration plans to argue it's too early to propose specific
measures to deal with the problem, officials say.
   The White House's cautious approach in developing responses to
global warming is expected to unleash renewed criticism from some
European countries that the United States is failing to provide
leadership in dealing with the so-called ``greenhouse'' effect.
   The Bush administration has maintained that while there is
widespread agreement that man-made pollutants are causing the earth
to become warmer, there remain too many unanswered questions to
warrant pollution controls that could have widespread economic
implications.
   The president is hosting a White House conference on the
greenhouse effect on Tuesday, just days before next Sunday's Earth

conference was a top priority and would be held in his first year

   Yellow Creek used to run black for
miles, with a stench that made people retch. Red blisters
disfigured fish in the stream.
   People downstream blamed pollution from a tannery and aged
sewage treatment plant in this town of 13,000 for their neighbors'
cancer deaths as well as their foul well water.
   In 1983, the city engineer testified that 2.5 million gallons of
raw or partly treated sewage had been dumped into Yellow Creek that
year alone.
   Today, Yellow Creek sparkles as it winds quietly through the
thickly forested Appalachian hills. People who live along the creek
say water quality is probably the best they've seen in a decade and
credit the $7.7 million sewage treatment plant built in 1986.
   Credit is also due to the Yellow Creek Concerned Citizens, a
local environmental group that has labored since 1980, filing
lawsuits, lobbying Congress, holding candlelight memorials for
people they believe were fatally sickened by pollution, occupying
city hall to demand that the creek be cleaned.
   But the black tide, although receded, left behind a legacy of
health questions and lingering legal challenges. Neighbors suspect
that years of tannery pollution deposited a layer of toxic sediment
in the creek bed. And they're worried that a new court agreement
will loosen pollution regulations.
   Over the years, word of Yellow Creek and its lessons has
stretched well beyond this mountainous corner of southeastern
Kentucky. The tactics and victories of the Yellow Creek Concerned
Citizens are being studied by environmental groups across America,
and in some cases, around the world.
   ``Remember, this struggle for the small community of Yellow
Creek is in no way the only one,'' said M.M. Chiputa of the
Southern African Environmental Network of Zaire. ``We have it, you
have it and they have it.''
   Yellow Creek has gained such attention largely because of Larry
Wilson, the president of the citizens group. Wilson is
environmental programs director at the Highlander Institute in New
Market, Tenn., which holds training sessions for social activists
who hail from Bhopal, India, to Dayhoit, Ky.
   As a polished insider of the national environmental movement,
Wilson wields influence that last month drew more than 100
activists from Massachusetts to Arkansas to a meeting on the future
of Yellow Creek.
   John O'Connor, executive director of the National Toxics
Campaign in Boston, struck a common theme among many of the
speakers at the March 31 meeting.
   ``We kind of feel if they can get away with poisoning people in
Yellow Creek, they can get away with poisoning anyone in the United
States,'' O'Connor said.
   Yet Yellow Creek is anything but poisonous today, according to
the Environmental Protection Agency.
   EPA environmental engineer Ron Barrow said results of a study of
creek water and surface sediment, to be released later this month,
will ``show significant improvements'' over a 1982 study of creek
pollution.
   A standard EPA test using water fleas showed they not only
survived but also reproduced in full-strength effluent from the new
sewage plant.
   And Dirk Anderson, manager of the Middlesboro Tannery Co., says
it ``has done an excellent job in meeting state and federal
guidelines'' and ``installed the most efficient pretreatment system
in the tanning industry today.''
   He says the tannery's waste water ``is one of the best
discharges in the United States'' and asks, ``What is the
controversy?''
   To many residents, the controversy remains vivid.
   An advisory warning residents of Bell County since the early
1980s not to swim in the creek, drink its water or eat its fish is
still in force.
   Wilson asserts that he ``feels really comfortable'' in
estimating that 100 deaths in the valley from cancer, leukemia and
other illness can be linked to the pollution.
   A 1988 study of Bell County cancer rates, while failing to tie
the illness to creek pollution, did show that residents face an
increased risk of cancer.
   ``Those cancers that have been linked to occupational exposure
to tannery work tend to be higher in Bell County than the
comparison groups,'' said the report by Lorann Stallones, an
epidemiologist with the University of Kentucky Medical Center.
   And a study done in the early 1980s by Vanderbilt University's
Center for Health Services indicated that residents who drank well
water tended to have higher rates of miscarriages, kidney and
digestive ailments.
   A $31 million lawsuit filed by residents against the tannery in
1983 requested long-term health monitoring, a proposal supported
then by a leading state health official.
   ``Toxic chemicals often take many years to produce their
effects, and certainly there have been significant exposures in the
past because of the tannery effluent,'' Dr. Arthur L. Frank of the
University of Kentucky Medical Center said in a statement for the
lawsuit.
   No long-term monitoring is underway, and the lawsuit is still
pending in state court.
   Many of these concerns deal less with the creek's current water
quality and more with the sediment on its bottom. A University of
Louisville chemist probing the creek bed in 1987 found deep
deposits of chromium, a byproduct of tanning. In research by the
National Cancer Institute, chromium is suspected of causing cancer
in humans.
   W. Hank Graddy III, attorney for the citizens' group, said the
study indicated chromium was still accumulating ``even after all
these years of litigation and trying (to) ... require them to adopt
controls.''
   Barrow, the EPA engineer, and Bill Phillips, an attorney for the
agency, said they were not aware of any complaints about chromium
deposits until a reporter posed questions about the matter earlier
this month.
   That reaction, along with other official stances, has made
Yellow Creek residents suspicious of government regulators,
especially the EPA.
   Creek residents are worried, for example, about a new court
document signed by the city, the tannery and the EPA that will
alter the amount of chromium, cyanide, mercury, and bacteria
allowed in tannery wastewater sent to the sewage plant.
   Graddy, Wilson and others contend the agreement will increase
the permissable amounts and cause Yellow Creek to be polluted again.
   Attorneys for the city, tannery and EPA all say it would tighten
pollution regulations, not make the situation worse.
   The agreement amends a 1985 consent decree that settled a 1984
lawsuit filed by the Justice Department. That suit alleged numerous
violations of EPA regulations because raw sewage was spilling into
the creek.
   The disagreement is so strong because each side is comparing the
new document to a different prior arrangement: the officials assert
the provisions strengthen the 5-year-old consent decree, and the
environmentalists say they are weaker than those in an operative
pollution permit dating from 1985.
   The citizens' group also opposes the agreement because it would
reduce the fines levied against the city and tannery. Together,
they have been fined at least $1.62 million for federal pollution
violations, but collections would total only $177,400 under the
pending amendment.
   ``The burden of proof is on the victims here,'' Wilson said,
``because government agencies and industry already have the money
and lawyers in place to defend their position. ...
   ``We're overwhelmed,'' he said. ``We're fighting life and
death.''

<HEAD>Gramm-Rudman: Deficit Turning Point or Legislative Crutch?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After five years of not living up to its name,
the balanced budget act is under attack by some members of the
Congress that passed it _ but if it is the crutch they call it,
it's still the only one around.
   So they'll keep limping along with it, toward the moving goal
line of a balanced budget, which now is supposed to be reached on
Oct. 1, 1993. The original deadline was next Oct. 1, but the
government won't come close, even with the bookkeeping gimmicks
that keep some spending outside its limits.
   Deadlines don't count for that much. Congress is supposed to
adopt its annual budget resolutions by April 15 each year, but that
schedule is meaningless. House and Senate committees will get down
to the business of writing budget blueprints this week.
   They'll have to shrink the deficit by about $37 billion or face
the prospect of another round of automatic spending cuts later this
year.
   That's the way the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget act of 1985
works, and a conservative analyst says Washington should be
saluting its success, not complaining at its shortcomings.
   ``Since it was enacted, inflation-adjusted federal spending has
grown by only 1.4 percent annually, a dramatic reversal of the
runaway federal spending increases of previous periods,'' according
to Daniel J. Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation. Mitchell says
annual spending increases averaged 3.6 percent in the 1970s and 4
percent between 1980 and 1985.
   At the same time, the federal budget deficit as measured for
Gramm-Rudman purposes has declined from $212 billion in 1985 to an
estimated $123.8 billion this year. ``Adjusted for inflation, the
deficit today is less than half the size it was five years ago,''
Mitchell says, calling that grounds for celebration, not criticism.
   Mitchell also defends the system of automatic spending cuts that
take effect if the projected budget deficit doesn't match
progressively lower targets that are supposed to lead to balance in
the 1993 budget.
   The deficit ceiling for the next budget year is $64 billion,
dropping to $28 billion in the 1992 budget and to zero in 1993. The
whole system is built around estimates, not actual deficits, and
the estimates always have been exceeded in the end.
   Nevertheless, Mitchell argues that the law was a turning point
in the battle of the budget, and says many of its critics don't
like the system because it works too well for their interests.
   ``Many legislators resent having to choose which programs will
receive scarce funds,'' he says. ``Special interest groups are
having a much harder time getting access to taxpayers' wallets...''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy takes a different route to the same
conclusion, that the Gramm-Rudman system is worth keeping. The
Massachusetts Democrat wants it used in a fashion that would have
Congress devote defense budget savings _ the peace dividend _ to
domestic programs, not budget balancing.
   ``We do not have to apply the peace dividend _ and we should not
apply it _ to deficit reduction,'' Kennedy says. ``Instead, we
should let the Gramm-Rudman process run its course through 1993 _
exactly what would have occurred without the great, unexpected,
peaceful revolution of 1989.''
   Much as Congress set up the Gramm-Rudman system to control
deficits it could not, or would not, deal with vote by vote,
Kennedy proposes a national needs trust fund that would put defense
savings off limits. He said that should come to at least $170
billion over the next five years, and probably more. Kennedy said
that would guard against ``interest group bargaining that would
turn a unique opportunity into a trivial division of spoils.''
   ``Let us deal with the deficit as President Bush intended on the
day he took office _ not with a peace dividend he did not expect,
but with a Gramm-Rudman process he has repeatedly endorsed,''
Kennedy said.
   His trust fund proposal stands no realistic chance, but it does
fit the trend in Congress, which is to devise formulas and systems
to make things happen automatically, outside the traditional
legislative process.
   That amounts to an admission that Congress can't control itself.
   A leading advocate of change in the spending and budget system
is Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, who proposed a tough deficit control plan but
isn't getting far, either.
   Rostenkowski wants to earmark any peace dividend for deficit
reduction, raise taxes, cut some politically sensitive spending,
repeal Gramm-Rudman, and force Congress to make hard choices again.
   ``Gramm-Rudman is a crutch, a collective confession of our
inability to lead and our unwillingness to face up to our
responsibilities,'' he said in outlining his plan a month ago. ``We
didn't have Gramm-Rudman for the first 209 years of the republic.
   ``Let's repeal it and govern the old fashioned way _ elected
officials, representative of the people, exercising their judgment,
making decisions in the national interest and honestly paying for
the cost of government that their constituents demand,'' he said.
   ``Has it been so long ago that we've forgotten how to do it?''

<HEAD>The `New Vaudeville' With a Vengeance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Remember Sunday nights, when people would gather
around the tube and tribalize with Ed Sullivan and jugglers and
magicians and acrobats and puppets and beautiful ladies in tights?
What did they call that stuff?
   Oh, yeah. Variety.
   If you miss those days, CBS and magician-author Ricky Jay offer
a droll, affectionate and engrossing hour Thursday night of
'90s-style vaudeville: ``Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women.'' You
just don't see this stuff on TV nowadays.
   The show's title comes from Jay's book, a history of such
esoteric acts as pigs who could do arithmetic and women who could
endure steak-broiling temperatures.
   The entertainments are interspersed with backstage business,
historic footage and photos illustrating the extent to which
jugglers, magicians and daredevils would go to thrill an audience.
   Jay opens the show in Los Angeles' Warner Grand Theater with his
own amazing ability to throw playing cards farther, faster and
harder than anyone in history. ``Unfortunately, this theater is too
small,'' he allows.
   Then he demonstrates WHY the theater is too small, defending
himself against various fruits up to and including a belligerent
watermelon. For further instruction, see his book ``Cards as
Weapons.''
   ``That dates back to my childhood in Brooklyn, when I started
throwing baseball cards,'' Jay said in an interview. ``I discovered
I could hit things.''
   The pace is wonderful. If Shakuntala Devi, the lady who
calculates cube roots at a glance doesn't thrill you (and frankly,
extracting cube roots does rank right up there with dental work),
there's another act right behind it.
   Like Michael Moschen, a man who juggles himself, who
delightfully animates a cystal ball.
   Or Meagan Riesel, a 100-pound strongwoman for the '90s, who
shows off her mastery of the ``odic force,'' a skill that lets her
resist being lifted or displaced by much stronger, heavier people.
   Jamey Turner, a virtuoso on glass harp, plays Beethoven's ``Ode
to Joy'' on 60 water-filled brandy snifters, and quick-change
artist Michael McGiveney plays all the parts in a scene from the
stage play ``Oliver Twist.'''
   John Gaughan, the leading designer of magical illusions, shows
off his restoration of an automaton acrobat, a fascinating
mechanical device built by the great magician Robert Houdin in 1847.
   And Steve Martin, the comedian, brings in ``lost footage'' of
his vaudevillian grandfather, The Great Flydini, one of the
greatest magicians of all time, who produces all manner of innocent
objects from a startling place.
   ``These are people that I am particularly fascinated by,'' Jay
said. ``This is my world. These people are all, to some extent, my
friends and some are also my very close friends.''
   All these delightful acts are interspersed with amusing
backstage business: A woman in Bo Peep outfit leads an enormous hog
and a very small bike offstage. ``How'd it go?'' Jay asks.
   ``Not so good,'' says Bo, looking tired. ``He wouldn't do the
wheelie.''
   Tune in.

   In an economy gone ecological, some of the old
marketing concepts that once could be relied upon to sell products
have developed a reputation as bad as noxious chemicals.
   In the best of the marketing tradition, however, you'll find few
companies complaining. While their tested concepts have been
degraded, they have embraced the new. What's new sells, and they
know it.
   They accept the idea that they just can't use ``disposable''
without accepting consequences, and that in selling cars and
gasoline they must steer clear of horsepower claims and talk about
low mileage and clean burning.
   In cereals, health is tops and taste is now secondary. In a
cholesterol-conscious world the beef industry talks about leanness
rather than juiciness, and fast-food outlets are forced to
reconsider their recipes.
   Annual reports of paper companies show clean streams rather than
log-filled ones, and those of heavy manufacturers are more likely
to show the factory's beautiful front lawn than the parts inventory
in the rear.
   In marketing today you must be against pollution, for recycling,
against fat and for lean, for peace rather than military might, and
view diets as necessary to good health rather than for making a
person swim-suit slim.
   You can do no wrong if you align your company with peace,
health, equal rights, sexual equality, clean environment,
patriotism, education, naturalness, opportunities for minorities,
community mindedness, family life.
   While such concerns have forced almost every company in America
to rethink its values and recast its image, the effort has not been
without benefits. Like anything else, these issues can be used to
promote goods and services.
   In short, and in a marketing sense, those movements designed to
improve the quality of life have come of age. They are powerful
enough to sell goods and services.
   While the observance of Earth Day on April 22 is the proximate
reason for all the attention being given such issues, they have
been developing for a long time, simultaneously with a weakening of
resistance.
   Twenty years ago, for example, some of the nation's biggest
paper companies were reluctant to spend the nine-figure sums
required to clean up their operations, which were among the largest
polluters of waterways.
   The Council On Economic Priorities, a volunteer group, began
rating them on compliance with environmental standards, and
discovered that paper companies with the best environmental records
tended to have the highest price-earnings ratios on their stocks.
It helped sell environmental issues.
   Peace became a practical, dollar and sense issue too. Various
groups developed mutual funds that included shares of companies
deemed peaceful, that is, not connected with military matters in
any way. Some did fairly well.
   Health consciousness was being raised at about the same time,
and when President Jimmy Carter denounced the three-martini lunch
as a waste of money it already was on its way out. Liquor
consumption statistics document it.
   The consumer movement, which began even before the
environmental, health and women's movements, was then at full
strength, denouncing the very notions that bigger was better, that
glitz was chic, that exclusive was better.
   All movements develop their radical fringes and tend to be
scorned at some time by some people, but if they have the goods, so
to speak, they gain acceptance, even if grudgingly.
   Acceptance is grudging no more for many of the movements that
began in the 1960s and 1970s. They've come a long way, and you know
it when corporate marketing people use their themes to sell goods
and services.

   Only in America could an Irish bandleader
in a town of Polish immigrants transform that most hokey of ethnic
music into sounds worthy of Carnegie Hall.
   You see, polkas don't come just with kielbasa, anymore.
   ``Slush down some beer and Polish sausage _ that's all some
people see when they think of the polka,'' said Fred Hudy,
president of the International Polka Association in Chicago.
``We're trying to get rid of that image.''
   ``They're definitely out of the closet, now,'' said Ian Dove,
spokesman for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences,
which added a polka category to the Grammys five years ago.
   The Jimmy Sturr Orchestra is riding the new wave of polka
popularity, winning the Grammy four straight years. Sturr has
played at New York's Carnegie Hall six times, the only polka band
to perform that much at the celebrated concert auditorium.
   Once relegated to the stomping grounds of local sausage fests or
to Sunday morning radio broadcasts, the polka is following Latin
American and Cajun into the musical mainstream.
   ``It's big business,'' said Sturr, 42, an Irish bandleader who
lives in the Orange County village of Florida about 30 miles
northwest of New York City.
   His 10-piece orchestra has recorded 76 albums _ 75 polka and one
country _ on his Starr Records label, which he started in 1964. The
label records other polka, country and ethnic groups, including
Bobby Vinton.
   Getting its own Grammy category has completed the legitimization
of a musical form once thought squarer than the square dance. Until
1985, polka music was lumped into the catchall folk category, Dove
said.
   ``It was felt that polka was a form of music unto itself,'' he
said. Similarly, the Grammy trustees created separate categories
for reggae, tropical Latin and Mexican-American music in recent
years.
   Sturr started his first band when he was 11. Though Irish, he
was surrounded by Polish-Americans, who made up four-fifths of his
hometown's population. Sturr grew up with the polka and fell in
love with the music. He began recording and touring with his polka
band in the musical maelstrom of the 1960s, when most people viewed
the polka as a dance confined to the bowling alley crowds of
Milwaukee or Buffalo.
   ``It's moved out of that ethnic category,'' Sturr said. ``Now
everybody enjoys the polka. When I was a kid and somebody said,
`Hey, what kind of band do you have,' I'd be embarrassed to say I'm
in a polka band.''
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perprich declared 1990 the Year of the
Polka. Thousands attend polka festivals each year in Minnesota,
which claims to have ``the granddaddy of all polka fests,'' in
Gibbon, Minn.
   Like Cajun and country, the shrill brass and reedy woodwinds of
some polka styles revolve around the accordion, which is enjoying
its own return from corn purgatory.
   ``It's a happy music, it's a snappy music,'' Hudy said. ``Your
feet automatically tap.''
   Several rock groups have transformed themselves into new wave
polka bands, turning out what Sturr calls ``punk polka.'' One such
band, Rotundi, has scored a parody polka hit with ``Polka Till You
Puke.''
   In the United States, the polka is most closely associated with
Polish-Americans. Yet the polka _ invented in 1830 by a peasant
girl in Bohemia, now part of Czechoslovakia _ never was popular in
Poland, even though it was influenced by Polish styles of music and
dance.
   As the polka swept through Europe in the 1830s and '40s, Poland
was trying to regain its independence from Russia. Other Europeans
considered the polka _ a two-step with a hop thrown in _ a dance of
sympathy for Poland's oppression. But the Poles felt the polka
mocked the way Polish women danced, said Charles Keil, American
studies professor at the state University of Buffalo.
   Europeans had a ``general fascination with Poland as a
struggling country whose borders had been violated. ... That's
where polka dots came from. Everybody was naming things after the
polka,'' said Keil, whose book, ``Polka Happiness,'' is being
published by Temple University.
   From Europe, the polka traveled around the world. It became
Paraguay's national dance, while American Indians out West adopted
a form of polka in the 1860s.
   ``Those Indians think of the polka as their traditional music
nowadays,'' Keil said.
   While Sturr's Polish-American polkas win Grammys,
Mexican-American bands in southern Texas are producing the most
innovative polka music today, Keil said.
   The Mexican-American style mixes Latin and polka rhythms, while
Sturr's eastern Polish style relies on woodwinds, accordions and a
frantic beat. In the Midwest, the slower German polka _ with its
brassy oompahs _ is popular, while plucky banjos highlight country
polka styles.
   Polkas must be written in two-four time, two quarter notes per
measure, a tempo which gives the music its dancy beat. The songs
can range from the ``Too-Fat Polka'' _ with its whimsical chorus,
``I don't want her, you can have her, she's too fat for me'' _ to
the more sentimental ``Did You Ever Fall in Love Polka'' from one
of Sturr's albums.
   Songwriter Steve Lopuch has contributed three songs to Sturr's
records, including titles on his 1988 Grammy album ``I Remember
Warsaw'' and this year's winner, ``All in My Love for You.''
   Lopuch's source material ranges from nursery rhymes in ``The
Crooked Man Polka'' to all-American denim in ``The Blue Jeans
Polka.''
   ``When these people came, the Irish, Polish, Lithuanians,
Germans, Italians, they didn't have nothing,'' said Lopuch, a
retired dairy farmer in the Montgomery County town of Florida, 30
miles west of Albany _ not to be confused with the village of
Florida where Sturr grew up. ``They planned to stay a few years,
make some money and go back, but most didn't go back. They stayed,
and so did their music.''
   Lopuch has written about a dozen polkas based on nursery rhymes
which he hopes to have recorded by Sturr's orchestra or some other
polka band.
   ``I'm hoping grandparents will buy it for their grandchildren so
they don't listen only to rock,'' Lopuch said.
   Keil has similar hopes that more young people will turn to
polka. Local polka fests are dying out because ``a younger
generation has not come along and gotten into the dancing of it in
any big way,'' he said.
   He predicts there will be a revival of polka dancing. ``It's so
good _ it's eating, drinking, dancing, partying music. Because it
survived so long despite rock 'n' roll, despite TV, because some
fanatic people won't give it up. ... It's a matter of young people
getting really bored with post-punk nonsense. People will see that
community dancing is a powerful thing.''

<HEAD>Chef-Artist Serves Meal in `Remembrance of Things Past'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For novelist Marcel Proust, a madeleine
triggered ``A Remembrance of Things Past.'' For chef and artist
Shirley King, Proust's novel triggered thoughts of things to come.
   Those things recently came together when King prepared dinner
from foods in Proust's novel and exhibited her photographs of
Proust's France, pairing each dish and picture with a quote from
the author.
   And to set the stage for what King called ``a real Proustian
evening,'' she chose music from the Belle Epoch, ``rather dreary
sort of quartet music.''
   As Proust, who lived 1871-1922, wrote lavishly of his memories,
King lavished her attentions on each dish, skewering a beef roast
with carrots that had been cut into flower shapes, spinning sugar
to accompany homemade pistachio and coffee ice creams (served, of
course, with madeleines), or giving a pineapple and truffle salad a
Japanese appearance.
   ``The Japanese influence was quite strong in those days, not
that it would have reached out to that country house. But anyway
...,'' said King, author of the 1979 book, ``Dining With Marcel
Proust _ A Practical Guide to French Cuisine of the Belle Epoch.''
   Charmed by a description of chunks of aspic, King served the
beef, cold, as the main course. For Proust, the beef was ``couched
by the Michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly,
like transparent blocks of quartz.''
   ``I chose the dishes by the quotes,'' said King. ``The quotes
are so lovely.''
   The meal, served April 5 to about 60 people, was prepared with
the help of advanced students at the French Culinary Institute and
is part of the school's ``Artist and Cuisine'' dinner series. It
was the first at which the artist and chef were the same person.
   King's dreamy photographs, hung around the institute's dining
room, feature the landscape of the village of Illiers-Combray,
where Proust spent childhood vacations. Also among the 18 pictures
are shots of the house where he spent holidays.
   King also has written ``Saucing the Fish,'' and her ``Fish: The
Basics'' is to be published later this year. A former restaurant
chef, she teaches cooking in New York.
   She became interested in Proust after a friend recommended him
more than 15 years ago. ``It was my habit, and still is, to read
all of one author.'' And as she read, she noticed the attention he
paid to food.
   His descriptions ``still turn me on,'' she said in an interview
before dinner. ``It makes me very interested and passionate about
food.''
   ``With the first few pages of `Remembrance of Things Past,' one
becomes aware of the brilliantly told, minute observations of food
which Proust weaves into his story,'' King writes in the
introduction to her book. ``Very soon meals and culinary happenings
become an integral part of the book.''
   Using his own past, Proust's monumental novel tells of innocence
lost, love and friendship, sin and despair and the search for
truth. Written in seven volumes, three of them published
posthumously, the memories of the title are set off by the taste of
tea and a madeleine, a small rich cake baked in a shell-shaped mold.
   The men at King's dinner were given red carnations, stems
wrapped in silver paper, as was done for Proust at his dinner at
Mme. Swann's, the same dinner at which he first encountered caviar.
   King's first course, blinis with caviar, was inspired by a
comment that would gladden the hearts of the sqeamish: ``On the
other side of my plate was a smaller plate, on which was heaped a
blackish substance which I did not know then to be caviar. I was
ignorant of what was to be done with it, but firmly determined not
to let it enter my mouth.''
   That was followed by skate with black butter, the beef, the
salad and dessert.
   The salad, an unusual combination of endive, pineapple and
truffles, was made by Proust's mother to impress a visiting
ambassador. ``But the ambassador, after fastening for a moment on
the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer, ate it
with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat and without
disclosing to us what he thought of it.''
   And so, we shall not.

   Doreen Edward's third rejection letter arrived
earlier this month.
   ``I was disappointed but not squashed flat,'' she said about the
return of her third manuscript from Mills and Boon, publisher of
romantic fiction.
   Hoping to hone her talent, Edward recently came down from her
home in Wales, husband grudgingly in tow, to attend a Mills and
Boon writers' workshop at the London Book Fair.
   Mills and Boon, Britain's equivalent of Harlequin in the United
States, depends heavily on self-starters who are willing to slave
over a typewriter between household chores or holding down a job.
   The company receives 5,000 unsolicited manuscripts a year, and
editorial director Frances Whitehead crisscrosses the country to
dispense encouragement and criticism to her authors.
   More than 100 people, mostly women, recently turned up to hear
Whitehead and one of her best-selling authors, Sally Wentworth,
dispense nuggets of advice.
   Among the pearls of wisdom for romance writers:
   _ Disease isn't taboo but messy disease is.
   _ The best time to submit manuscripts is mid-January, after the
pre-Christmas deluge.
   _ The hero should have a ruthless streak. Women don't fantasize
about apologizers.
   _ Submit more than one title. Chances are your first choice has
been used before.
   ``The formula for a Mills and Boon novel is that the couple
meets on page one and after 50,000 words they have decided to spend
the rest of their lives together. It's up to the writer to fill in
the rest,'' Whitehead said.
   Mills and Boon has been publishing romantic fiction since 1908,
when Gerald Mills and Charles Boon founded the company. Last year
it sold 15 million books in 19 languages.
   ``The Japanese are not keen on books set in Australia, and the
French don't like books set in France because they don't want
anyone else writing about them,'' Whitehead said.
   Sally Wentworth's 43 books, including ``The Lord of Misrule''
and ``Wish on the Moon,'' have sold 15 million copies in 13 years.
But the audience gasped when Wentworth confided that her success
was preceded by 14 rejection letters.
   Wentworth said she writes 2,000 words a day, generating about
four books a year. She said she combs the birth columns of the
conservative press for characters' names, such as Verity, Charlotte
and Skye.
   Only a handful of men attended the seminar, which isn't
surprising. Only two of Mills and Boon's stable of 300 permanent
authors are male and they write under women's names.
   Dorothy Minton, 45, was waiting to hear Mills and Boon's verdict
on ``Deceptively Yours,'' her third offering. Her first two were
rejected with words of encouragement. She declined to give away too
much of the plot, but said it was racier than the work of that
other giantess of the genre, Barbara Cartland.
   Minton took up writing when a medical problem with her shoulders
forced her to give up her florist job. Her daughter-in-law, Fiona,
27, is spending her maternity leave writing ``The Rainy Day Book''
under the pseudonym Jinx Moran, and is on chapter three.
   ``I want my baby to be late so I can finish it,'' she said.
   Most of the aspiring writers want to make enough money to quit
their daytime jobs, or pay for an extra vacation or car.
   Whitehead said authors receive royalties of 4 percent of the
paperback book profits. The average paperback sells for 1.40 pounds
($2.30), less than half the price of an ordinary paperback.
   Among the most successful authors are Wentworth, Charlotte Lamb
and Penny Jordan.
   Wentworth makes no claim to literary greatness.
   ``Mills and Boon books are often looked down on, and critics
have no time for them,'' she told the audience. ``But they are
extremely popular and the readers know exactly what they are
getting and they will enjoy it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Forty years ago on June 25, communist North
Korea invaded South Korea to begin a three-year war that would cost
thousands of American lives and billions of dollars in aid. And if
the Cold War has ended in Eastern Europe, the two Koreas today
remain armed camps. Now the United States is cutting back its
troops and closing three air bases in South Korea, leaving many
wondering what effect that will have on the balance of power.

<TEXT>
   Once a month the huge sprawling city
of Seoul comes to a standstill as shrieking sirens and loudspeakers
warn 10 million citizens to seek cover in air-raid shelters.
   For 20 minutes the frenzied economic and political capital of
South Korea, one of the world's largest cities, is hushed. The only
movement along wide boulevards and narrow alleys are green army
jeeps on surveillance patrols checking to be certain citizens
complied.
   Thirty miles north, beyond barbed wire and concrete bunkers,
lies the most heavily fortified border in the world and one of the
last frontiers of the Cold War _ the Demilitarized Zone separating
South and North Korea.
   While Eastern Europe celebrates the collapse of communism and
the easing of East-West tensions, the Korean peninsula continues an
arms buildup with virtually no signs of detente between the
capitalist South and the communist North.
   For South Korea, security and war preparedness are number one
national priorities and the monthly air-raid drills are symbolic of
the times. In both Koreas, billions of dollars a year are spent on
armies and weapons.
   ``Nothing remotely comparable to events in Eastern Europe is
happening in North Korea,'' says U.S. Ambassador Donald P. Gregg.
``If the hallmark of South Korea is progress, the hallmark of the
North is stagnation.''
   Despite this grim evaluation, the United States, primary sponsor
and chief ally of South Korea for four decades, is making plans to
reduce its 43,000 forces. New economic realities are forcing
alterations in the two nation's relationship.
   To most South Koreans, the special brotherhood with the United
States has had a single purpose _ to deter or defeat a new invasion
from the North. Many Americans see wider economic issues and point
to a $4.7 billion trade imbalance and the current deployment of
troops as altruism their country can ill-afford.
   Restructuring of delicate bilateral alliances poses tough
questions for those trying to protect American interests as well as
preserve peace and stability. Can South Korea, which has cost
Americans dearly in blood and treasure, become self-reliant as U.S.
troops are withdrawn?
   For its part, South Korea faces a critical turning point in its
defense posture as it enhances its military capabilities and looks
to develop new and independent thinking for the next century.
   Among factors influencing the United States and South Korea are
these:
   _Communist North Korea has more soldiers, more tanks, more
artillery pieces, and more planes than the South, and many analysts
say it will hold a military advantage for at least the next five
years.
   _North Korea is widely believed to be nearing capability to
develop a nuclear weapons program and it reportedly has agreements
to sell arms in the Middle East.
   _Northeast Asia is unique in that it engages the vital interests
of four of the world's great powers _ the United States, the Soviet
Union, Japan and China. Strategically, U.S. policy has been that no
single nation or coalition of nations should control the resources
and people of the region.
   _Despite all the hostility and suspicion between the two Koreas
and all the energy that has been invested in the construction of
separate and competitive societies, Koreans continue to cherish the
hope _ however bleak _ of national unification.
   The ideological and civil war that began in 1950 between North
and South Korea lasted 37 months. More than 5 million Americans
served in Korea with 140,000 casualties.
   The country was rubble and 2 million South Korean soldiers and
civilians had died by the time the armistice was signed in 1953.
American forces, the largest contingent among 16 nations who fought
on the side of the South, were seen as heros.
   In the immediate aftermath of the bloody and horrible civil war,
it became a national passion to make certain that Americans never
leave Korea again. Americans became the key deterrent to renewed
communist aggression.
   Now radical students yell ``Yankee go home!,'' burn effigies of
Uncle Sam and stomp American flags painted on roadways at college
campuses.
   The Korean War remembered vividly by the 1950s generation is
only a textbook to today's Korean soldier, an independent,
consumer-oriented conscript who thinks Korea is No. 1 and is
generally indifferent toward the United States.
   Not so long ago Korean officers accepted American decisions, but
nowadays military observers say they too are quick to engage in
confrontation. ``On virtually all matters there has to be a
negotiated yes or a negotiated no,'' says one American.
   For a quick look at Korea, nothing is quite as sobering as a
visit to the barren no man's land along the 2.5-mile wide
Demilitarized Zone, rimmed with barbed wire, bunkers and guardposts
along both sides of the 155-mile-long border.
   On a spring day the undulating hills and valleys of the DMZ are
green with new grass and yellow wildflowers. Flocks of birds flap
overhead.
   Except for the camouflage netting, the personnel carriers, the
mile-long anti-tank barriers, the soldiers moving in full combat
gear and the sound of jeeps, the DMZ could be a rural scene from a
tourist brochure.
   DMZ duty is the closest assignment the army has to combat.
Soldiers in flak vests and helmets carry loaded automatic weapons
and focus their sights directly into enemy territory. Sentries with
binoculars watch communist guards from behind sandbagged guardposts.
   Clashes along the border are fewer than they used to be, but
incidents still occur.
   In February, on the eve of a visit by U.S. Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney, 20 shots from a North Korean guardpost hit a South
Korean guardpost. There were no injuries. The South did not return
the fire.
   In March, U.S. and South Korean forces unearthed what they said
was an invasion tunnel dug under the border by North Korea. This
was the fourth such tunnel found and the Korean Defense Minister
said there could be as many as 20 more.
   Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.), who favors cutbacks in the military,
said his first visit to the Korean border this winter stunned him
and made him see the threat of a North Korean attack in a new light.
   Analysts agree such a threat remains serious, especially from
terrorism and subversion, and could be increased by political
unrest on either side. South Koreans raise the specter of an
all-out invasion.

   Ultimately the question is, Can South Korea can deter communist
aggression? Can it become self-reliant?
   Few military systems have been affected by other powers as
profoundly as that of South Korea. The United States helped create
the country's armed forces, designed its organizational structure
and selected its first officers.
   South Korea this spring is embarking on an ambitious military
improvement program that entails modernizing its forces by
purchasing new weaponry, developing its aerospace program, changing
its defense hierarchy and democratizing its military.
   President Roh Tae-woo, a former general, calls it the
``Koreanization'' of the military and it's a major step toward
creating an armed forces seen as more Korean and less American.
   The centerpiece of the South Korean military is the prestigious
Korean Military Academy founded in 1946 and consciously modeled on
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
   All of South Korea's presidents have been KMA graduates since
Park Chung-hee, who gained power in a 1961 military coup with some
of his classmates. The 11th class in 1955 produced former president
Chun Doo-hwan and his successor, Roh.
   Although civilian control of the military is taught at the
academy, the sense of professional elitism, an almost puritanical
ethical code and a devotion to national service has led in the past
to a willingness by the military to take over the reins of
government if a threat to national security was perceived.
   The 650,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in service are
better fed, better trained and better housed than ever before.
Military service is compulsory. Draftees are paid only about $15 a
month, but there's a growing, if controversial, effort to improve
their lot.
   Revisions suggested for a new military code of conduct became
public recently and included controversial guidelines regarding the
use of firearms, rules for controlling civilians during violent
protests and new limitations as to when and if a soldier could
disobey the order to fire.
   There's also a suggested ban on political involvement and on
violence and abuse in the barracks.
   The military, like Korean society, is vertical rather than
horizontal in structure and Koreans used to knowing their place
among associates feel comfortable in the rigid, authoritarian chain
of command.
   ``Within the U.S. military, there's a willingness to send things
up the chain,'' says a longtime Western observer. ``But in Korea,
the hierarchy serves to send things down the chain.''
   An American meeting a military colleague asks what class he was
in to determine if they have mutual friends. A Korean officer asks
a new acquaintance his class to determine who is superior.
   Koreans still have a reluctance to pass along bad news, fearing
they will be blamed and punished, according to U.S. officers. In
the U.S. Army it wouldn't be held against an officer to report the
enemy advancing on his flank, but in the Korean army, he could be
reprimanded, experts say.
   Assessing the Korean soldier, a Western military expert says:
``For a major war on the ground, U.S. troops are the best. But if I
had to defend an obstacle _ a country _ and if it required hard,
close fighting with limited objectives, I'd go for the Koreans.''
   ``If you tell a Korean soldier `go do it,' he'll go do it. No
matter what the cost. No matter if it's his life.''
   In military terms, North Korea seems to have more of everything.
More soldiers, more tanks, more planes, more submarines and more
artillery.
   The majority of communist troops are deployed offensively near
the border. North Korean missiles could reach Seoul in two to three
minutes, bombers in eight minutes, tanks in two to three hours.
   Is there any hope of an arms reduction between the Koreas?
   On April 4, South Korea formally agreed to a U.S. plan to cut
back 7,000 of the 43,000 American troops by 1993, all
non-combatants. They include 2,000 air support personnel assigned
to three U.S. air bases which Cheney announced in January would be
closed as a cost-saving measure.
   This was called the first stage of U.S. withdrawal. Further cuts
could come in 1994-95 after a review of the military situation on
the peninsula. Third-stage cuts would come after 1996.
   North Korea has demanded a withdrawal of all U.S. troops.
   Seoul and Washington are looking for North Korea to reciprocate
with some form of comparable reduction. South Korean Defense
Minister Lee Sang-hoon has said he expects arms control talks in
the middle 1990s after concluding a non-aggression pact and a peace
treaty.
   Washington and Moscow are pressuring the Koreas to talk
seriously on ways of building mutual confidence. Rapidly improving
trade and diplomatic ties between anti-communist Seoul and Moscow
are seen as a moderating influence between the two Koreas.
   War preparedness is so costly many observers say economics will
drive the Koreas together long before ideology.
   Since 1950, Washington has spent roughly $59 billion dollars in
Korea on war and military aid, ranging from loans and weapons
procurement to the training of Korean officers.
   In addition to containing communism, the alliance between South
Korea and the United States has been a remarkable economic success
story. The United States has helped South Korea become the world's
10th largest trading nation with 1989 trade volume of $130 billion.
   It is the country's growth that has spurred Washington to demand
that Seoul open its markets wider to U.S. products and pay more of
the costs of keeping U.S. troops.
   South Korea now absorbs $1.9 billion in land leases and pays
about $300 million in direct local costs, an average of $50,000 per
American soldier. The United States puts in an equal amount, plus
an additional $3 billion to $4 billion for indirect costs, such as
wages, which would be incurred regardless of where the troops were
stationed.
   Having the American forces in Korea has been good business for
Korea.
   U.S. Forces Korea, if viewed as a business conglomerate of U.S.
and Korean employees, ranks as the fourth largest employer in
Korea, exceeded only by the giant companies of Hyundai, Samsung and
Daewoo.
   As the efforts continue to reduce tensions and bring the Koreas
closer together, American businessmen and diplomats hope the United
States will be able to develop an economic presence which is
appropriate to its military and political influence.
   U.S. Ambassador Gregg is optimistic.
   ``We are clearly in a constructive transition moving from our
role as a military alliance to a new and broader role as an
economic and political partnership,'' he says. ``We are, I hope,
entering a new decade in which the Korean question will finally be
solved.''

   Soldiers of the ROK army have to be
hard.
   In the army of the Republic of Korea, they run naked before
breakfast, swim icy rivers in the winter, take orders without
question, and get mainly veggies to eat.
   In the army of South Korea, they may even be whipped.
   U.S. soldiers have seen young Korean soldiers with whip lashes
across their backs.
   Reformers are demanding the armed forces of South Korea
eradicate vestiges of the old Japanese imperialist practice of
``kihap,'' or manhandling, which often resulted in fatal injuries
during disciplinary punishment.
   A field commander in South Korea's 1st Division smiled when
asked about charges that discipline in the ROK army had sometimes
been fatal.
   ``Corporal punishment is almost non-existent nowadays,'' he
said. ``We used to batter them.''
   Korean soldiers also are reluctant to pass along bad news,
fearing they will be blamed and punished, U.S. officers say.
   At the annual U.S.-South Korean joint military maneuvers two
years ago, a Korean soldier killed himself after a mock battle
rather than admit to his superiors he had misplaced his weapon.
   Training for Korean soldiers is like year-round boot camp. They
run for 45 minutes before breakfast every morning, most often naked
and with their superiors running alongside barking orders.
   In winter, they jump in rivers and lakes with chunks of ice to
build up stamina.
   Officers have black belts in martial arts and soldiers are
expected to become proficient in Taekwondo, fencing and judo.
   Food is rice, fruit and pickled cabbage called kimchi.
   Staff Sgt. Kim Moon-soo served three years in the Korean Army
before he became an American citizen, joined the U.S. Army, and was
assigned to the 25th Infantry Division based in Hawaii.
   Training in the U.S. Army, says Kim, ``is a piece of cake.''
   The U.S. Army, he says, ``wants you to take responsibility. The
South Korean Army only wants you to take orders.''

   The Korean peninsula was divided into
North Korea and South Korea in 1945 at the end of World War II. In
the four decades since, the South has had five leaders while the
North has been dominated by only one.
   Kim Il Sung, 78, president of North Korea, is the longest
governing ruler in the communist world and the object of a slavish
personality cult which revers him as ``Great Leader.'' Kim's son,
Kim Jong Il, has been groomed to succeed him in what would be the
first communist dynasty.
   Capitalist South Korea was first administered by the American
Military Government. In 1948, elections were held and South Korea
elected Syngman Rhee as president of the nation's First Republic
government.
   South Korea's government is divided roughly into five periods.
The last three heads of state were generals or former generals.
Changes in governments were sometimes turbulent and one president,
Park Chung-hee, was assassinated.
   Here is the list of South Korea's leaders:
   Syngman Rhee, First Republic, 1948-1960.
   Chang Myon, Second Republic, 1960-6l.
   Park Chung-hee, Third and Fourth Republic, 1962-1980.
   Chun Doo-hwan, Fifth Republic, 1980-1988.
   Roh Tae-woo, Sixth Republic, 1988-present.

   It was one of the darkest moments in U.S.
history. The last Americans were scrambling aboard helicopters to
flee Vietnam, defeated by a communist enemy they had fought so
long. AP Special Correspondent George Esper, who spent 10 years
covering the Vietnam War, was in Saigon when South Vietnam fell 15
years ago. He was expelled five weeks later by the new regime. Here
he recounts those final days in vivid detail.

   The colonel had a crazed look in his eyes, despair in his voice,
facing a calamity that on this final day would bring to an end a
century of Western influence in Vietnam.
   A beaten man, he stood at a South Vietnamese war memorial in Lam
Son Square in Saigon. In happier times, it was a place where
revelers had exploded firecrackers in joyous celebrations.
   But on this Wednesday morning, April 30, 1975, the colonel and
thousands like him had been told in a broadcast by the Saigon
government to stack their weapons in surrender to the feared
communist North Vietnamese.
   I stood there with him, face to face, trying to sort out what
was going on.
   The colonel frantically waved his arms.
   ``Fini! Fini!'' he shouted.
   His right hand moved to his holstered pistol. Would he take aim
at me, a symbol of the American allies he might have felt had
abandoned him and his countrymen in these final days?
   The colonel saluted the statue, raised the pistol to his head
and fired. He fell dead at my feet.
   His war was over.
   There was fear, panic and humiliation among the South Vietnamese
troops pouring into Saigon from their outposts and garrisons to lay
down their weapons and those trying to flee the country with their
American allies.
   ``Intoxicating panic,'' the commander of Saigon's defenses
called it in an interview just before he slipped out of the country
on an American helicopter 24 hours before the South Vietnamese
government surrendered.
   On the day of Saigon's fall 15 years ago I walked through city
streets littered with boots and olive green uniforms discarded by
South Vietnamese soldiers who were trapped and faced the wrath of
the communists. They had changed into civilian clothes in efforts
to hide their military service for fear of reprisals.
   The ``Pentagon East,'' the once-bustling U.S. military
headquarters inside Tan Son Nhut Air Base, lay gutted by grenades,
destroyed by the Americans themselves.
   An American flag lying in the streets outside the U.S. Embassy
was being trampled on. A colleague and I picked it up.
   North Vietnamese soldiers in loose-fitting uniforms and pith
helmets stood guard at positions once manned by crew-cut,
spit-and-polish American Marines.
   I watched soldiers raise the red, blue and yellow flag of the
National Liberation Front _ the Viet Cong _ over the Presidential
Palace.
   In the final days, scores of Vietnamese friends, journalism
colleagues, army officers and politicians had lined up outside the
AP bureau asking me to intercede with the U.S. Embassy to get them
out of the country. Some followed me around, slept outside my
apartment, not letting me out of their sight, thinking that if I
left they somehow would escape with me.
   Left behind in the hysteria of the disorganized evacuation were
more than 400 friends and allies of the United States, including
Vietnamese embassy employees and their families. They had been
promised safe passage out of the country.
   At the AP bureau, the incoming teletype from New York
headquarters clicked off a message from Wes Gallagher, then the
president and general manager of the AP. He advised there might be
one more helicopter.
   ``Any of you want to leave if it works out?'' he asked.
   ``Gallagher: Thanks for your offer,'' I replied. ``We want to
stay.''
   Only minutes earlier, the last American helicopter had left with
the last of 800 U.S. Marine reinforcements who had provided
security for the evacuation. Its flight ended the evacuation of
1,000 Americans and 6,000 Vietnamese, including many of the top
military commanders thought to be marked for death because of their
association with the United States.
   A rear guard of 11 U.S. Marines scrambled to the sixth floor of
the embassy, then to the rooftop landing pad to await the final
helicopter. A crowd of Vietnamese, panicked by rumors of a
communist bloodbath that never materialized, followed, desperately
seeking a way out of the country.
   The Marines tossed tear gas into the stairwells to fend them
off. Suddenly, off in the sunrise they spotted the CH-46 helicopter
for which they had been anxiously waiting.
   The happy Marines fired a red smoke grenade to guide it to the
landing pad. North Vietnamese forces ringing the city withheld
their fire, fearing retaliation by American bombers flying cover
for the evacuation. The Marines jumped aboard and the helicopter
whirled out of sight over the South China Sea to an aircraft
carrier.

   They were the last American military men to leave. At 7:57 a.m.,
just like that, 30 years of American involvement ended so suddenly
that even the North Vietnamese seemed surprised.
   Most U.S. military forces had left Vietnam two years earlier
under terms of the Paris peace agreement. But 50 American military
attaches and 1,200 civilians remained at the defense attache's
headquarters which had replaced the U.S. military command in the
Pentagon East. An additional 150 U.S. Marine guards remained at the
embassy.
   The final evacuation was hastened by a heavy artillery attack, a
signal by the North Vietnamese that they wanted the Americans out
of the country immediately. Tuesday, April 29, dawned with a
three-hour rain of rockets and artillery shells onto Tan Son Nhut
Air Base.
   Two recently arrived Marines, Charlie McMahon, 21, from Woburn,
Mass., and Darwin Judge, 19, from Marshalltown, Iowa, were on their
watch at the U.S. defense attache's headquarters on the base.
McMahon had been home on leave less than two weeks earlier. ``I'll
be back,'' he told his father as he left for Vietnam.
   Instead McMahon and Judge were struck down at random by an
imprecise North Vietnamese rocket in the final hours of shooting.
They were the last two Americans killed in Vietnam.
   In another tragic incident, a helicopter plunged into the South
China Sea during the evacuation. Two other Marines, Capt. William
Nystul, 29, of Coronado, Calif., and Lt. Michael Shea, 25, of El
Paso, Texas, were killed.
   During the evacuations, helicopters swarmed over Saigon, landing
on the rooftop pad at the embassy and at Tan Son Nhut Air Base
itself.
   Hundreds of South Vietnamese soldiers converged on the base,
seeking an escape route by air. South Vietnamese guards, angry that
the Americans were pulling out without them, fired their rifles
into the air over buses carrying the evacuees to board the
helicopters.
   ``We want to go, too!'' they shouted.
   Hundreds of Vietnamese tried to push their way through a
chain-link fence gate in the center of the 14-foot high wall
surrounding the U.S. Embassy compound.
   Vietnamese men and women tried to claw their way over the wall.
In danger of losing control of the situation and of being
overwhelmed by the crowd, frantic battle-garbed Marines and
civilians beat them back with pistol and rifle butts, feet and
fists. They pulled Westerners who couldn't break through the mob
over the wall by their collars.
   One young woman, an Amerasian, clung to the neck of an American
photographer.
   ``I will die if I stay,'' she cried out.
   Mothers held their children above the crowd, begging the
Americans inside to take them with them.
   ``Take it, I've got to fight,'' one Marine yelled as he thrust a
tiny Vietnamese boy into the arms of a German clergyman. Minutes
later, with the 6-month-old baby cradled in his arms, the clergyman
was in a helicopter en route to one of the ships in the South China
Sea.
   The evacuation ended at 4:20 a.m. the next morning, April 30.
Twenty-five minutes later, U.S. Ambassador Graham Martin left
carrying the American flag. Another group of officers departed less
than an hour later. Then the Marine rear guard left minutes before
8 a.m., closing the doors to Vietnam.
   Now, all ties were severed and an eerie quiet fell across the
capital as 3{ million Saigonese anxiously awaited the triumphant
march of the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong into the city. At noon,
the conquering troops rolled down Unity Boulevard in tanks and
trucks to claim the Presidential Palace, the White House of South
Vietnam.
   At some point, to my surprise, two North Vietnamese soldiers who
looked no older than 20 casually strolled into the AP office. They
made no threats or demands. To me, they seemed like curious country
boys who were awed by the big city.
   We offered them Cokes and some stale poundcake, the only food
and drink we had left in the office. We took out a map and they
showed us the invasion routes their forces had taken on their
advance to Saigon.
   They talked about their homes in the North and how much they
missed their families. They showed us photos they had carried
through the jungles and monsoons for months.
   For 10 years I had been writing about the North Vietnamese _ 50
killed, 100 killed _ cold statistics in battlefield reports. I had
seen them in death, their bodies stacked across the killing fields.
I had seen them in prisoner of war camps and in delegations that
came to Saigon for peace talks.
   Now they were standing in front of my eyes. I thought to myself,
``They're the same as the South Vietnamese. They have the same
feelings, the same fears, the loneliness for families. For nearly
two decades they've been killing each other and taking so many
Americans with them.''
   For them, and for me, the war was finally over.

   To the people of Plelo, U.S. Army Lt. Robert
Hamsley is an unsung hero of World War II. Now, more than 45 years
after he led an American platoon into the French village and wiped
out a contingent of heavily armed Germans, Hamsley will be honored
by the town he saved.

   In August 1944, U.S. Army Lt. Robert
Hamsley led a five-tank platoon into the French village of Plelo
and wiped out a contingent of heavily armed Germans.
   Two days later, German anti-tank guns knocked out four of the
five tanks and damaged Hamsley's own M-4 before he and the three
crew members recovered. They destroyed the attack guns, killed and
routed some 100 Germans and rescued the wounded.
   The second action earned Hamsley the Bronze Star and a promotion
to captain. The successful attack at Plelo went practically
unnoticed, and it was unreported in the official diaries of the
15th Cavalry Regiment of Gen. George Patton's Third Army.
   But the people of Plelo never forgot.
   Now, 46 years later, the mayor and the village council of Plelo
have declared Hamsley a hero and the town's liberator. They have
named him an honorary citizen and are recommending that he be
awarded the French Legion of Honor.
   Hamsley, now 71 and a winter resident of Orlando from his home
in Lawrenceburg, Tenn., is overwhelmed by the attention. He and
several family members will travel to Plelo in June for a
celebration in his honor.
   If it weren't for the five tanks and 20 men under Hamsley, many
of the village residents would have been executed in the town
square by the Germans. In addition, a small force of French
resistance fighters called the Maquis were in danger of being wiped
out.
   At the moment the American tanks rumbled into town, the German
soldiers had lined up against a high wall an elderly woman, her
daughter and the village priest to be shot as collaborators of the
Maquis, according to one published account.
   To the Germans' amazement, other residents had stepped up
alongside the three condemned citizens. The enemy occupiers also
were rounding up still more villagers.
   But the Germans were routed during intense firefights in the
village square and at a nearby field where they were garrisoned.
The American tank platoon, assisted by the Maquisards and some of
the villagers, killed about 50 enemy soldiers and captured 60,
according to the accounts.
   Hamsley and his tank platoon quickly left Plelo, met up with
their main column the next day and were soon engaged in the battle
near Plouigneau which earned him the Bronze Star.
   Hamsley says things were moving too fast for a debriefing of his
platoon's activities at Plelo. By the time a sketchy report was
made, it became a footnote to ensuing battles.
   ``We just did our job. We figured it was just another day's
work,'' Hamsley says.
   He never knew the full significance of the side trip to Plelo or
that his platoon's cavalry charge would go down in village history
_ until this past year.
   Amateur French historians and a retired American colonel
pinpointed Hamsley as the man on the spot and researched the
details of the military encounter. They pieced together eyewitness
accounts and consulted military records and village archives.
   The ex-colonel, Robert Dwan of Tucson, Ariz., spends much of his
time ``trying to get belated recognition for deserving members of
the 15th Cavalry,'' in which he also served as a platoon leader in
France.
   Dwan contacted Yvon Herve, a history buff who lives in Brittany
near Plelo, and Roger Gergaud, another resident of the area, to
uncover details of the battle.
   Herve sought out a number of the rural area's older residents,
among them a former mayor of Plelo who was a boy of 15 and one of
those scheduled for execution in the town square at the time of the
German-American battle.
   In a 1975 French history entitled ``The Battle of Brittany,''
author Jean Joseph Barsel writes that the Americans ``saved the
people of Plelo from death and destruction, as the Germans had put
everything into place for the total destruction of the village.''
   Jean Querrou, a member of the French resistance at that time,
told a newspaper recently that ``we old combatants recall with our
heart'' the American officer they had helped ``to save the
inhabitants of Plelo from a dramatic situation.''
   Plelo's current mayor, Yves Le Coqu, wrote Hamsley last August
informing him of the council's action in naming him an honorary
citizen of the village ``in testimony of our gratitude for your
courageous action of Aug. 6, 1944, which led to (the village's)
liberation.''
   The mayor wrote again in November to thank Hamsley for accepting
their invitation to visit in June. He was overjoyed, the mayor
wrote, ``at the idea of finally being able to welcome _ 46 years
later _ the man who was our liberator.''
   Hamsley will fly to Paris and then travel to Plelo on June 16
for a celebration in his honor.
   Most accounts of the battle mention the ``providential arrival
of the American soldiers,'' particularly because many of the
inhabitants had gone to the village church to pray that they be
spared from the German occupiers.
   Hamsley agrees with the use of the word ``providential'' because
he and his platoon were reluctant participants in the Battle of
Plelo.
   ``It had to be providential that we wound up there when we were
separated from our main unit for a couple of days _ without radio
contact,'' Hamsley says. ``Our main concern was to get to Brest,
not to engage in an out-of-the-way battle.''
   The still-slim, Hamsley, who in civilian life became a horse
auctioneer, a law enforcement officer and businessman, looks
forward to seeing Plelo again.
   ``I remember it as a pretty town,'' Hamsley says. ``I remember
well the town square or plaza and a park. I want to see the high
wall with its iron grillwork where much of the fighting took
place...It will be, like they say, `providential.'''

   John Hatch, founder of the non-profit Foundation
for International Community Assistance, promotes village banking to
encourage private enterprise in the Third World. What he foresees
is a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Hatch says he hit upon his Third World
``poverty vaccination'' while panic-stricken on a flight to Bolivia.
   He had decided he could not comply with requirements of a
consulting job he had accepted from the Agency for International
Development, and he was scrambling to come up with a suitable
substitute.
   ``And on my second double bourbon at 35,000 feet up flying over
the Andes, I have to say it was like this thought just rolled
through my body,'' Hatch recalls. ``I had my calculator out and I
was sketching this thing and I was doing numbers, and I arrived in
La Paz with a full-blown concept.''
   What he had stumbled upon was village banking, a system of
investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance
their private enterprise, allowing them to create savings while
paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans.
   The series of loans, starting at $50, is renewable over three
years to a ceiling of $300, allowing recipients to reach a level at
which they can qualify for commercial credit.
   What Hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has
translated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than
35,000 members. Portfolios total $1.6 million, with a 96 percent
repayment rate. Village banks are operating in Mexico, Haiti,
Thailand, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Peru and El
Salvador.
   The concept is similar to the one behind the Grameen Bank of
Bangladesh: channeling money to the impoverished, principally
mothers, without the demands of commercial banks for collateral, so
they can improve their families' lives.
   What Hatch foresees is a body blow to world poverty through
bootstrap economics.
   Hatch, a one-time Peace Corps volunteer with a doctorate in
economic development, is founder and president of the non-profit
Foundation for International Community Assistance, which recently
moved its headquarters from Tucson to Alexandria, Va.
   He says its impetus was, and remains, the thousands of children
worldwide who die daily because of starvation, what he calls the
sacrifice of ``probably our most precious resource.''
   Hatch focuses on reaching mothers in the belief that
strengthening them economically lets them care for their children
better. There is ``almost a 100 percent guarantee'' that increased
income for women will go into improvements in their children's
welfare, Hatch says.
   ``We teach severely poor mothers how to create their own
self-managed bank, which provides them with self-employment loans,
provides them with savings incentives and provides them with a
support group of mothers like themselves, so that they are all
attacking change at the same time.''
   Lawrence Yanovitch, small enterprise development program
coordinator for Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore, Md., says,
``John Hatch is close to the voice of the poor. Though he's come up
with some sophisticated economic tools, he's kept the
humanitarianism.''
   Catholic Relief Services entered a five-year, $1 million joint
venture a year ago with the U.S. Agency for International
Development and the foundation to create 40 village banks in
Thailand.
   They targeted microenterprise development through small
entrepreneurs, vendors, village market women, who in some
developing countries comprise up to 50 percent of the employment.
   Capitalization for one bank typically will cost a sponsoring
agency $5,000.
   Beryl Rupp, a Rotary Club official in Phoenix, says the bank
members buy necessities with their profits or savings: a chair to
sit on, pots to cook in, blankets, better food.
   The women, when asked, speak of the greatest benefit in terms of
what Hatch calls ``empowerment perceptions.''
   ``They say things like, `Now I'm somebody,' or `My husband
respects me more.'''
   Their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each
comprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at $50, can
earn enough to provide savings and create capital. Hatch says the
loans give them freedom to start their own investment projects in
or near home.
   The foundation will go into a village with a joint-venture
partner that puts up at least half of the capitalization, such as
Rotary Clubs or Catholic Relief Services, and identify a key woman.
She then contacts others to attend an organizing meeting.
   ``Forget the mayor, forget the priest, forget the chief,'' Hatch
says. ``We want to know who the most powerful woman is in that
village.''
   At the meeting, the women circle illustrated examples of
quick-turnover work they want the loans to finance. It might be
selling produce, groceries, baked goods, raising chickens, sewing
or craftwork.
   Each woman signs her name or provides a thumbprint as
collateral, agreeing to repay one-sixteenth of the loan weekly,
plus interest of 1 percent to 3 percent, in line with local banks.
In some countries, the repayment rate has been 100 percent.
Overall, the average is 97 percent, says Hatch.
   ``Fifty percent or more are illiterate, and I would say 90
percent of them don't have any idea of what they're getting into
when we start out,'' says Hatch. ``And yet within 16 weeks they're
all experts. They just learn as they go.''
   Women who join the bank screen members and elect their leaders
from first-meeting attendees.
   At the end of the 16th week, each member's loan balance is zero.
But at the same time, each woman has been depositing weekly savings
of at least 20 percent of the original loan. The savings serve as
incentive for subsequent loans by increasing the credit line each
time, Hatch said.
   Interest in village banking is mounting.
   The United Nations has provided a $50,000 grant to research the
effects of women's empowerment through village banking on maternal
and child health practices.
   The foundation has major proposals pending with the Agency for
International Development, the Ford Foundation, Citibank and the
Chase Manhattan Bank, among others.
   Rotary Club 100, a Phoenix organization, and a Rotary Club of
Mexico City are in a joint venture, having funded five village
banks in Guaymas, Mexico, with another four to be launched in the
slums of Mexico City.
   Hatch says he believes village banking has a role to play in
reducing poverty along the Mexican border and in slowing down
migration to this country.
   As for whether such a system could work in the United States,
Rotary's Rupp says, ``Frankly, it's the only hope we have of
changing the welfare system.''
   ``Ultimately the way out of poverty is savings,'' Hatch adds.
``It's got to be built on the back of their own savings.''

   As long as two football fields end-to-end, it's
the world's largest sailing ship now in service. The recently
launched Club Med I will sail the Caribbean in the winter and the
Mediterranean in the summer with a cargo of mostly young adults
looking for fun and games. And don't worry if there is no wind. The
sails are just boosters for its diesel engines.

   When a sudden blow came up on
the Spanish Main the other day, no bearded bosun bellowed, ``All
hands aloft to bend canvas, reef and furl sail.''
   The captain just pushed a button and the computer located behind
the wheelhouse rolled up the seven enormous sails like window
shades and in seconds set about controlling the list of the world's
largest sailing ship now in service.
   ``I am in love with this ship; she maneuvers just like a fish,''
enthused Alain Lambert, captain of the recently launched Club Med
I, presiding over a console of dials, scopes and screens. ``Even in
the roughest seas, she just stays on the waves. On the passage from
the Canaries to Cape Verde, during our maiden voyage in January, we
had 40-knot winds and the computer reduced sail perfectly.''
   As we headed toward the U.S. Virgin Islands, on one leg of a
seven-day cruise out of Guadeloupe with 220 passengers on board, a
weathered old schooner with dingy brown sails crossed our bow. The
captain ``spoke'' her with a friendly blast on the foghorn.
   ``For me this is something glorious, a whole new life,'' he
said, studying a yellow screen that in dancing graphics showed the
sails receding on the five aluminum masts and the booms changing
position. ``It's like going back a century to find a passenger ship
that looks like a ship and not like a floating soapbox. Notice,
wherever we go, they admire us.''
   Sure enough, as we entered the harbor at Charlotte Amalie, a
whole flotilla of yachts, fishing smacks, sightseeing craft, even a
straying ferry, ventured near to ogle us, the way the South Sea
Islanders circled Captain James Cook's HMS Endeavour in their
outrigger canoes.
   At anchor, a huge stern ramp was lowered like a World War II
landing craft to disgorge an armada of water-ski boats, windsurf
boards, sailing sloops, several boatloads of scuba divers
shouldering air tanks and a school of web-footed snorkelers.
   Dr. Jean-Yves Siriez, the ship's surgeon, led the diving party.
The German second mate, Uwe Heidenreich, took leave of the bridge
to join the water-skiers.
   Meanwhile, a long file of passengers, some in T-shirts
proclaiming ``When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Go Shopping,''
went down the long gangplank into the bobbing tenders for an
assault on the duty free shops and posh restaurants of the U.S.
Virgin Island capital.
   Is this a cruise ship, like dozens of others in Caribbean
waters, offering the seagoing ambiance of shuffleboard, glitzy
floor shows, bouillon at 11 on the sun deck and black-tie captain's
dinners?
   Or is it a floating Club Med village, dedicated like the 110
others around the globe to macho sports, sumptuous buffet meals
with wine, casual dress and lifestyles in an atmosphere of
ebullient camaraderie?
   Some of both.
   Village veterans on their first cruise wondered whether Chef de
Village Janyck Daudet outranked the captain in the reception line
at the welcoming cocktail party. When the ship's program decreed
``elegant dress'' for dinner, some put their best foot forward in
jogging sneakers.
   Cruise ship veterans, spoiled by big-name Las Vegas acts on
other ships, were only moderately tolerant of the nightly amateur
musicals staged by the exuberant staff in the superbly equipped
theater. For Club Med addicts, the beachcomber fantasy was blurred
a bit by using credit cards instead of beads to barter for drinks
in the five bars.
   There was a bridge instructor on duty in the card room, but in
deference to a younger, more active cruising clientele there were
no shuffleboard, bingo or steeplechase races.

   During the winter season, the Club Med sails the Caribbean out
of Guadeloupe. In the summer it will cruise the Mediterranean out
of Ville Franche on the French Riviera.
   Designed by architect Francois Xavier Poylo and built in Le
Havre, France, the $100 million ship is owned by three French banks
and leased to Club Med and Service et Transport, a shipping firm,
for seven years with an option to buy.
   At 617-feet, it is not the largest ship with sails in history.
The Great Eastern, nearly a century and a half ago, was 60 feet
longer, had propellers the size of windmills and stationed a bugler
at the top of the companionway to summon her 4,000 passengers to
dinner. A failure in the passenger trade, she found glory as a
giant sea spider, spinning out the Atlantic cable.
   Second mate Heidenreich, a sailing buff, cites the cargo ship
Thomas Lawson, plying the Maine coast at the turn of the century.
``She had seven masts, each named for a day of the week.''
   This ship's top speed of 14 knots, with an assist from her four
diesel-powered electric turbines, is sluggish compared with the
great clipper ships like Cutty Sark and Flying Cloud, which fully
rigged with 28 sails rushed Forty Niners around the Horn to the
California gold rush at 20 knots.
   But her creature comforts are a far cry from what Club Med
offered poor French students and vacationing secretaries at its
first tent village on Majorca 40 years ago.
   Telephones, TV, hair dryers, mini-bars, king-sized beds and
Matisse prints grace the 204 cabins decorated by Alberto Pinto, who
did the Gucci offices in Milan and a royal yacht for Prince Kaled
of Saudi Arabia.
   There are two dining salons, two outdoor pools, a casino, a
beauty parlor, sauna and a duty-free boutique.
   Alas, the tradition of a ship's library has shrunk to a bookcase
of paperbacks.
   With a draft of only 15 feet, this hi-tech windjammer can visit
smaller islands and lonelier beaches. A boulder-strewn cove called
``The Baths'' on Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands was
scorned as ``too commercial'' because its pristine sands were
interrupted by a beer tent and a stall selling T-shirts.
   On St. Thomas the beach was already occupied by a few thousand
sailors from the U.S. aircraft carrier Enterprise enjoying their
first shore leave in six months.
   The exotic combination of a new five-masted cruise ship anchored
in the same harbor with a nuclear powered carrier begged the
question of why this return to sail in the Atomic Age?
   The Japanese had experimented with sail-driven tankers during a
world oil crisis in the '70s, and now, said Capt. Lambert, ``They
want to buy our software.''
   When Mikhail Gorbachev addressed the United Nations a year and a
half ago, a Soviet trade fair in New York exhibited models of a new
generation of freighters with auxiliary sails. Two other
computerized sailing ships, about a third smaller, are already in
the cruise trade and more are on the drawing board.
   ``This is not a romantic gimmick,'' insists Lambert. ``Under
sail the ship is quieter, more comfortable for passengers. She
rolls less. There is no vibration. With normal power we use 20 tons
of marine diesel in 24 hours. Under full sail, with our four
generators also going, we use 7 tons. If the wind is from the
starboard, our computer directs the exhaust fumes off to port side.
   ``Even when there is very little wind, the sails give us an
extra 2 knots speed, and every owner knows the last 2 knots are the
most expensive.''
   The great clipper ships required a crew of 130 to wrestle with
acres of canvas. Stretching 2,990 square yards of Dacron, this
latter-day descendant needs only 35 officers and seamen. ``Not
counting our most versatile hand, the computer,'' adds the captain.

   The new head of the U.S. Border Patrol believes
illegal aliens looking for work should be treated with compassion,
even as they are turned back. But when it comes to drug runners and
other criminals, Mike Williams is in favor of using the military to
help seal the border. Some alien advocates disagree.

<TEXT>
   For almost a quarter century, Mike
Williams has wrestled with the paradoxes of the nation's southwest
boundary, an escape route for the destitute, the front line of the
nation's war on drugs, yet a doorway for commerce.
   Williams, a Border Patrol agent who learned Spanish from the
illegal aliens he turned away, is the agency's new chief.
   Williams was appointed in January to oversee the policing of
some 5,960 miles along the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico.
It's a $263 million-a-year operation involving 3,800 Border Patrol
agents in 22 districts.
   Williams says a good Border Patrol boss should know how to
balance compassion for the illegal aliens looking for work in the
United States with intolerance for the drug runners, auto thieves,
alien smugglers and other sinister characters who defy the law.
   ``I think that we don't need to apologize because we want to
control our borders,'' Williams said in a recent interview as he
completed his move to Washington from El Paso.
   ``I think we need to recognize the sensitivity of the reasons
why people come _ and we do _ but I don't think we need to say that
we should not enforce laws.''
   Williams also makes no apologies for controversial proposals to
have the military help the Border Patrol fight illegal drug traffic.
   ``I feel it is morally right to try to prevent this plague
that's attacking America,'' he says.
   Williams, a native of Gainesville, Fla., began his Border Patrol
career in 1967 after a four-year stint with the Coast Guard. At his
first posting in Comstock, Texas, he learned the Indian tracking
techniques the patrol uses to pursue undocumented aliens. Often he
would track them up to 70 miles inland though rugged country.
   He says conversations with the illegal immigrants he arrested
taught him Spanish and developed his understanding of their
hardships.
   ``They come here to get jobs, to feed their families, to
possibly increase their standard of living,'' he says. ``The worst
thing that can happen to them is they'll get sent back to Mexico,
so they're going to come here to try to improve their standard of
living.''
   Williams demanded similar empathy from his officers when he
headed the El Paso Border Patrol sector, says Gus de la Vina, now
its acting chief.
   ``He taught the difference between dealing with a criminal vs.
dealing with a person that is coming in that is not a criminal, but
is violating an administrative law,'' de la Vina says.
   Jose Guadalupe Moreno, director of the El Paso Catholic Dioceses
Migrant and Refugee Services, says he applauds the appointment of a
Border Patrol chief who professes to understand the plight of
immigrants. But he's not sure that a law enforcement officer can be
compassionate.
   ``Their job is to look for individuals who are here without
documents,'' Moreno says. ``No matter how professional they should
be, no matter what the policy, it still takes the individual to
follow through, to act in a way that will not step all over
people's basic and human rights.''
   Before coming to El Paso, the 45-year-old Williams headed the
patrol's office in Havre, Mont., and was deputy chief in San Diego,
the largest Border Patrol sector.
   Williams says he has no hobbies, spending most of his free time
with the patrol when he's not home with his wife, Pat, and their
three children.
   Even before leaving El Paso, he was talking eagerly about the
fight ahead to get more funding from Congress.
   ``It's a challenge to me, and I've always rode to the sound of
the guns,'' he said. ``I feel I can make a difference, that I can
help these men and women that are out here on America's front line
doing their job.''
   Williams has taken on Capitol Hill before.
   In 1986, he criticized Congress for its sluggish pace rewriting
immigration laws. ``We are losing control of the border,'' he said
then.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service believes the number
of people crossing U.S. borders illegally grows each year, though
there are no statistics other than the numbers caught.
   And that number has dropped by half since the Immigration Reform
and Control Act _ the law Williams pushed for _ was passed in 1986.
It granted amnesty to about 3 million aliens who had lived in the
country since 1982 and imposed sanctions on employers of
undocumented workers.
   In 1986, 1.6 million aliens were arrested. That fell to 855,315
in 1989.
   Border Patrol officials figure that fewer arrests mean fewer
people are trying to cross the border.
   Recently the number of arrests began to rise again. Patrol
agents say they believe they've controlled the exodus of Central
Americans over the border, but not Mexicans.
   Critics such as Brownsville immigration attorney Linda Yanez say
that's a sure sign immigration reform is not working.
   ``The purpose of much of the legislation was to curb and control
immigration, and it has not done that,'' Ms. Yanez says. ``It just
created more laws to punish and they don't work. Obviously we're
not addressing issues at their core.''
   The Border Patrol is moving into yet another arena of
controversy as it takes on more duties in the war on drugs.
   In fiscal 1989, the Border Patrol made 5,441 drug seizures
valued at $1.2 billion, up from 3,257 valued at $700 million the
year before.
   Ms. Yanez says she is most concerned about proposals to use the
military on the border. ``I don't think it solves any problem and
sends the wrong message,'' she says.
   But Williams welcomes the additional manpower.
   ``Because of the magnitude of this influx of drugs we're
experiencing, we welcome any assistance we can get,'' he says.
``They can be our eyes and ears out there, when we don't have the
manpower to be out there.''

   Stephanie Zimbalist has gone from solving
mysteries on television to creating one in ``Caroline.'' She plays
a young woman who was presumed dead for 16 years before turning up
to claim a family fortune.
   ``Caroline,'' the season's final Hall of Fame presentation on
CBS on Sunday, is in reality a touching family drama masquerading
as a mystery. The story, set in the 1950s, appears sinister at
first, with Caroline suspected of being an impostor out for the
inheritance. It then turns into something quite different.
   ``It's about how families work and don't work,'' says Zimbalist,
who starred for four seasons in the private eye series ``Remington
Steele.''
   ``It's a study of how families operate in a group. It's like a
little boat. If one person is dysfunctional it tips the boat.
   ``You have a father who is a workaholic. You have a mother who's
a control freak. You have a young girl who's handicapped. You have
a boy who has the one chance to become normal. But he's attached to
his sister by the hip.
   ``Caroline is the therapist. The hook of the story is whether
she's real? Is she Anastasia? But she comes in and helps the
family.''
   Pamela Reed also stars as Grace, the stepmother, who sees
Caroline not only as a fortune-hunting impostor but as an
interloper trying to drive a wedge between her and her own
handicapped daughter.
   George Grizzard is the father, Patricia Neal is Caroline's
former school mistress and Dorothy McGuire is the grandmother who
leaves the money to Caroline.
   Shawn Phelan plays as the young son and Jenny Jacobs, the 1982
Cerebral Palsy Poster Child, is Heidi.
   Joseph Sargent directed the production from a screenplay by
Michael de Guzman, based on the novel ``Father's Arcane Daughter''
by E. L. Konigsburg.
   At the heart of the drama is the conflict between Caroline and
the mother over special schooling for Heidi. Caroline sees her as a
bright child who is only mildly dysfunctional, while the mother
treats her as totally helpless and incapable of learning.
   ``Caroline says Heidi is who she is,'' Zimbalist says. ``You
can't keep hiding her. You face it, you erase it, you move on.
   ``Joe Sargent directed a lot of scenes with the children
watching from behind doors. That's because the children were not
allowed into the life of the family. It's so expressive of how life
was in the 1950s.''
   Zimbalist says her greatest pleasure in doing ``Caroline'' was
working with Pamela Reed, who is currently starring in NBC's
``Grand.''
   ``When you work with Pamela her burner is always on high,'' she
says.
   Given her druthers, Stephanie Zimbalist would rather be on stage
in front of an audience than in front of a camera. She has spent
much of her time in the theater since the end of ``Remington
Steele.''
   Zimbalist grew up in a show business family. Her father, Efrem
Zimbalist Jr. is an actor who starred in ``77 Sunset Strip' and
``The F.B.I.'' Her grandfather was concert violinist Efrem
Zimbalist and her grandmother was opera singer Alma Gluck.
   Even as a teen-ager she preferred the stage, but opted for
television when she was unable to find work. One of the first
things she did was a comedy pilot with her father.
   One of her earliest roles, and one she still regards as one of
her best, was as Elly Zahm in the massive miniseries ``Centennial''
in 1978-79. Author James Michener liked her portrayal of the
ill-fated pioneer woman so much that he wrote her a letter.
   She also won the heart of James Stewart when they worked
together in ``The Magic of Lassie,'' one of her few theatrical
films. He said she was his favorite young actress.
   She's currently co-starring in ``The Baby Dance,'' a two-act
play at the Pasadena Playhouse that she helped develop.
   The play is about a yuppie couple from California who are
adopting a baby from a backwoods family in Louisiana.
   ``Musicals are the thing I love to do most,'' Zimbalist says.
``There's hardly a musical that I don't know all the songs. It's
why I became an actress.''
   After the end of ``Remington Steele'' she toured for six months
with Tommy Tune in ``My One and Only.''

   ``Black Rain'' (Paramount Home Video. VHS-Beta. Rated R)
   
   Take one maverick cop, a young, vicious Japanese gangster,
motorcycles, two gritty cities and more blood and gore than most
people would rather see. Add more than a few cliches. Stir fry for
two hours and five minutes. And you get ``Black Rain.''
   ``Red Rain'' would have been more like it. This crime thriller
directed by Ridley Scott of ``Aliens'' and ``Blade Runner'' fame
features a murder by stabbing, another by throat-cutting, a
shooting death, at least one machine gunning and the slashing of
the hero _ and that's just in the first half-hour. We're also
treated to a graphic beheading, a finger amputation and gunfire
aplenty.
   Michael Douglas plays Nick Conklin, a New York detective whose
hobbies include daredevil motorcycling and raising obnoxiousness to
an art form. He's also suspected of stealing money from drug
dealers, but his brash manner makes him just a little likable.
Sometimes.
   Nick collars a gangster, Sato (Yusako Matsuba), after Sato rubs
out two rival Japanese mobsters in a New York bar. (Remember that
first half-hour?) Nick takes Sato back to Japan, but the killer
escapes after the plane touches down.
   And the hunt is on.
   The plot has so many twists and turns, you're dizzy by the end.
And there are other things that make little sense. For instance,
most of the time, the Japanese speak Japanese, without dubbing or
subtitles. But towards the end, they get subtitles. The Japanese
actors do speak English at some points, but in some cases it's
still impossible to understand what they're saying.
   The maverick cop has become a cliche, but Douglas takes it to
extremes. He's so mouthy and rude, you're surprised his Japanese
counterparts don't put him on the first 747 back to New York _ with
the luggage.
   There are some other formula characters to help him. There's
likable Charlie, good cop to Nick's bad cop, played well by Andy
Garcia. (Anyone who's been to the movies knows what happens to the
likable character. It does.) Then there's Kate Capshaw, who plays a
tough-cookie hostess at an Osaka bar. She's a walking scorecard on
Japanese gang warfare who fills Nick in despite the danger to
herself, but it's never made clear exactly how she knows all this
stuff or why she's helping Nick.
   Matsuba does a chilling job of playing Sato and Ken Takukara is
also good as Nick's Japanese partner in crimebusting, Masahiro. The
Osaka street scenes are interesting and Ridley Scott's dark, flashy
sets are up to his usually high standards. But this formula film is
way too violent and muddled.
   ``Black Rain'' isn't a tasty sukiyaki. It's mulligan stew.

   The works of Leonore Tawney, whose magical incorporation of
materials into her art made her one of the century's leading fiber
artists, will be on show at the American Craft Museum in New York
as part of the museum's ``Master Artist'' series.
   ``Leonore Tawney: A Retrospective,'' opening April 18, will
feature more than 100 works created over a 45-year period. The
exhibit will chronicle her use of feathers, eggs, stone, shells and
weavings, as well as abstract and figurative works in clay.
   ``Tawney was always an independent spirit who continuously
expanded the expressive potential of fiber and broke the
traditional rules of weaving when she found them restrictive,''
said Kathleen Nugent Mangan, guest curator.
   After its runs at the American Craft Museum through June 17, the
show moves to the Art Institute of Chicago from July 26-Oct. 28,
and the Renwick Gallery in Washington from April 12-July 21, 1991.

   Pianist Marcus Roberts is traveling the jazz
road laid down by the masters toward his own individuality.
   ``I figure, if you're going to learn how to play piano, why
wouldn't you listen to the music of (Thelonious) Monk. Or listen to
Duke Ellington,'' he says.
   ``I'm interested in following a road that has been forged and
set by the great masters of the art form. That will lead me to the
natural power of identity that I possess.
   ``It is my feeling that if you have a concept of the tradition
from which you come, that can only strengthen your personal
statement. It is not going to limit your creativity to have studied
30 great Duke Ellington compositions.''
   Roberts, who is blind, has been receiving increasing attention
and praise as pianist in trumpeter Wynton Marsalis' group for the
last five years. He now has his second album on Novus Records,
``Deep in the Shed,'' referring to a place for intense practice and
jazz experimentation. It presents six tunes he composed and
arranged, each a different exploration of the blues.
   ``I believe very strongly in playing blues. Any of the truly
great jazz musicians play blues. Some nights Duke Ellington would
play nine or 10.''
   ``The Truth Is Spoken Here,'' Roberts' first album, also on
Novus, an RCA Records label, had performances by drummer Elvin
Jones and tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse. ``Rouse played with
Monk. Elvin Jones played with the great (John) Coltrane. I always
had a great love for Coltrane's music. It was an honor for me to be
in the studio with him.''
   This record uses some of Marsalis' musicians and some unknowns
who played dates with Roberts last summer.
   ``There are a lot of brilliant young musicians who deserve an
opportunity to play. Whatever I can do to perpetuate that, I'm
going to do,'' Roberts said. Marsalis' group is touring now.
Roberts will start touring as a leader in May but he isn't really
looking forward to doing that full time. ``I like nothing better
than to walk on Wynton Marsalis' bandstand every night. Each day I
have more love for him and his music. It's hard to picture myself
not playing with him, even though I know eventually that will
probably happen.''
   He didn't always dream about leading his own combo, Roberts
says. ``First and foremost, I just wanted to be part of a group of
musicians that were all very serious and dedicated and who could
all play.
   ``I realized to get to a certain level of artistry it is
necessary that you, if possible, try to establish your own vision
and direction. I guess over the years I've started to think more of
having my own music and musicians.
   ``The first time it came up was years ago. Wynton brought it up.
I hadn't been in his band very long. He said, `Whenever it's time
for you to go and do what you have to do, know that I'll
understand.' I didn't know what he was talking about.''
   Roberts is 26. Nine years ago, jazz pianist Marian McPartland
was the first established performer to take an interest in him. She
was a judge in the first music competition he entered, which he
won. ``I was in high school. She gave me a lot of real good advice
early on. She represents what jazz music is all about. She goes all
over the place and does what she can to encourage young musicians
to come out and play. I have a great love for her.''
   He has been a guest on her ``Piano Jazz'' radio program.
   ``She told me, `Do as many records as you can. Document your
music because that's the only way people ever remember who you are.
Whatever you have to do, no matter what the money is, if you have
music ready to be recorded, get it recorded.' That's definitely
some of the best advice I've ever been given by anybody,'' said
Roberts, who plans his third record as a solo piano of tunes by
Jelly Roll Morton, Ellington and Monk.
   When he cuts his own records, Robert said, ``You have to
determine everything, concept, music, musicians. The puzzle has to
be in my mind and how the pieces should all fit together. When I do
records with Wynton, he is such an organized person, all I've got
to do is come in and play the piano.''
   Marsalis first heard Roberts in 1982 in Chicago, where he played
as a student winner at a jazz educators convention. ``He only heard
me three more times before I joined his band,'' he said.
   ``We would stay in touch over the telephone. We'd talk. He was
never that impressed with my playing. I was very, very surprised
when he asked me to join his band. I always hoped it would happen.
There was not a band in the world I would have preferred to play
with.
   ``Wynton's true greatness was not developed in the '80s. In the
'90s people will really see the level of genius Wynton has.''
   Roberts, who was born in Jacksonville, Fla., had cataracts as a
youngster. ``They operated when I was four or five. That was that.
I did have some vision before.''
   He was named Marthaniel. ``When I was in elementary school I
couldn't stand my name being butchered. I thought of Marcus. I like
Marthaniel better but I don't like people mispronouncing it.''
   He's a graduate of Florida State University. Earlier, he
attended a school for the blind in St. Augustine, Fla., which had
renowned piano teachers. He already knew Braille. He composed a bit
there, ``a few little love songs for my girlfriends.''
   His spirit has not been sapped by his blindness.
   ``My mother lost her sight when she was 15. She was able to keep
me in the right track. I couldn't say, `Nobody understands.'''

   The composers who wrote the
Grammy-winning song ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' are aiming their
ambition at another challenge: an Academy Award.
   The touching tune about worshiping loved ones was voted song of
the year in February, earning a Grammy award for co-writers Larry
Henley and Jeff Silbar. The song also was chosen record of the
year, earning another Grammy for Bette Midler.
   The song, performed by Midler in the movie ``Beaches,'' was not
eligible for an Academy Award because it was not written for a
motion picture.
   ``I watched the Academy Awards and thought, `Boy, I'd like to
have one of those,''' Henley said in an interview. ``You get this
award syndrome. It's so much fun to go up on that stage and get an
award.
   ``I'm hopeully going to get more songs in movies. My next goal
is to win the Academy Award.''
   Henley lives in Nashville. Silbar, who lives in Studio City,
Calif., is directing his songwriting toward an Oscar as well.
   ``I'm trying, since the Grammy award, to write with the best
writers I can and write for special projects,'' he said by
telephone.
   Henley and Silbar wrote ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' in 1981 on
Nashville's Music Row. Henley put the finishing touches on the
lyrics the next day as he sat alone on a yacht in the Gulf of
Mexico off Corpus Christi, Texas.
   An estimated 200 singers have recorded the song, with Midler's
version hitting No. 1 on the pop music charts last summer.
   The well-crafted tune, in dramatic and sweeping fashion, is
about one person telling another person that he or she is his or
her hero. The person being addressed is saluted for strength and
willingness to let others reap the glory of life: ``I can fly
higher than an eagle. Because you are the wind beneath my wings.''
   Warner Chappell, which published the song, says it has become
the most performed piece of music at weddings. It also is played
often at funerals.
   ``It gets people coming and going,'' Henley said.
   Silbar refers to it as ``the ultimate thank you song.''
   ``People have been looking for the words to say this and the
song just kind of crystallizes their thoughts,'' he said. ``The
stories I hear about it are wonderful: The song is dedicated to
fathers, brothers, husbands. It goes the whole boundaries of
relationships and how people feel to each other.''
   Henley says, ``It's become a catch phrase in America. I'm very
proud of that. I think that's one of the things hardly anyone ever
writes.''
   Both writers said the song fit well in ``Beaches,'' a movie
about friendship, even though the tune was written years before the
movie was conceived and was first a hit record by Gary Morris in
the country music field.
   ``The spot in the movie was the ultimate for a ballad,'' Silbar
said.
   ``It worked wonderfully in the movie,'' Henley said. ``It was
sort of a `Terms of Endearment' kind of movie. It was funny, then
it makes you want to cry. It leaves you with a very special
feeling.''
   Henley primarily wrote the lyrics, which is ironic because such
moving sentiments came from someone married and divorced four times.
   ``I've been single now for about 10 years,'' he said. ``I think
I've learned my lesson.''
   One of his ex-wives, who inspired the song, called him with
congratulations the night the Grammy Awards were announced.
   ``She's thrilled I'm sure,'' Henley said. ``She was one of the
heroes in my life. I've always been grateful for some of the things
she taught me.''
   Henley owns a place in music trivia. He'll probably always be
known for co-writing ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' but in the 1960s he
was lead singer for the Newbeats rock 'n' roll group. It was his
falsetto on such hits as ``Bread and Butter'' in 1964, and ``Run,
Baby, Run'' in 1965.
   ``I think my story has been sort of interesting, from `Bread and
Butter' to `Wind Beneath My Wings' by way of country music,'' he
mused. ``From rock 'n' roll to country to pop. It's sort of a
strange route.''
   His fondest memory from the Newbeats is doing a concert tour
with the Rolling Stones and Roy Orbison in Australia and New
Zealand.
   ``It was the most fun I ever had,'' Henley recalled. ``We had
the world in our hands and didn't even know it.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Impresario of Bad Taste Goes Mainstream</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What's this? John Waters, the impresario of
bad taste, hooked up with the people who gave you ``Parenthood''?
   What's more, his new film, ``Cry Baby,'' is being released by a
mainstream company, Universal Pictures. Has the onetime king of
underground sleaze succumbed to the Establishment?
   ``I've always tried to make commercial movies,'' he explains
unapologetically. ``Think about it. `Pink Flamingos' (1972) cost
$10,000. All the hideousness I put in that movie was commercial.
Nobody heard of us before. All the people who left that movie said,
`Oh my God, you wouldn't believe what I just saw!'
   ``I always try to be commercial _ on my terms. It worked, too.
That movie's still playing. Two generations have been offended by
that movie. I'm proud of that. It's hard to do.''
   Talk about inflation. ``Cry Baby'' cost $8 million, minor by
Hollywood standards but not Waters'. The film is backed by
Universal and Imagine Films Entertainment, operated by Ron Howard
and Brian Grazer, makers of ``Splash'' and ``Parenthood.''
   ``They have been a wonderful support,'' said Waters. ``They
never said to me, `You can't do that.' They gave me the money to do
everything I wanted to do, hire `all the stars in heaven.'''
   Well, not quite. ``Cry Baby'' stars Johnny Depp, the teen rage
of TV's ``21 Jump Street,'' and Amy Locane as star-crossed lovers
in the 1950s. The cast ranges from Polly Bergen and Susan Tyrell to
Traci Lords and Iggy Pop with cameos by Willem Dafoe, Patty Hearst,
David (``Ozzie and Harriet'') Nelson and Troy Donahue. It's all set
to the beat of early rock 'n' roll.
   ``I wanted it to look like a '50s musical, like `The Girl Can't
Help It' or early Elvis,'' Waters said. ``Or like the spinoff,
lower versions of `The Wild One' or `Rebel Without a Cause.' I
liked those movies, but better, I liked the cheap imitations.''
   A movie nut all his life, Waters confessed his lifelong
ambition: ``I always wanted to be a villain in a Disney movie.''
With his thin, pallid face, razor-thin mustache and black suit, he
could easily have done so. Growing up in Baltimore, he gave puppet
shows from the age of 8 to 14, when he feared his playmates would
consider it ``uncool.''
   His first movie was shot in 8mm in 1964 when he was 19. The
title: ``Hag in a Black Leather Jacket.''
   ``It's in my closet, where it will stay,'' he said. ``It was
filmed on the roof of my parents' house. It was about a black man
marrying a white woman with a Ku Klux Klan member performing the
ceremony. The man took her away on the honeymoon in a garbage can.
It was very influenced by the 1960s Theater of the Absurd. It
played once in a beatnik coffee house, and that was it.''
   Waters continued making films with his Baltimore buddies until
the breakthrough with ``Mondo Trasho.''
   ``It was the story of a hit-run driver on one hideous day in her
life,'' he recounted. ``It starred Divine, and in the end Divine
died in a pig pen and the Virgin Mary appeared to her.
   ``In `Multiple Maniacs,' Divine was raped by a 15-foot broiled
lobster. `Pink Flamingos' was about a battle between the filthiest
people alive. `Female Trouble' was about a criminal who wanted to
be famous so badly that she got the electric chair; that was like
the Oscar in her chosen profession. `Desperate Living' was about
the worst town you could live in when you're so embarrassed about
your life you have to move there.
   ```Polyester' was a comedy about the hell of suburban life where
everything smells bad; it was released in `Odorama.' `Hairspray'
was a musical comedy about a teen dance show. `Cry Baby' is a
juvenile delinquent comedy.
   ``So you can see that my sense of humor has been the same from
the very beginning.''
   Despite the outrageousness of his themes, Waters claims, ``the
critics have been good to me since the very beginning. You get bad
press when you start believing the nice things that you all sign.
   ``Bad reviews? Rex Reed gave us the best: `Where do these people
come from? Where do they go when the sun goes down? Isn't there a
law or something?' That quote was our whole campaign in selling the
picture.''
   Although Waters' films are treasured at Saturday midnight
screenings, he insists that he enjoys a wide audience: ``After
`Hairspray' had been out, we found that 8- and 9-year-olds really
loved the films. That's an audience I had never tested, never even
thought of. They liked it on one level; they didn't see the parody
of it.
   ``When we tested `Cry Baby,' there were a lot of kids who said
they thought it was a really romantic movie. They can like it on a
another level. That's OK. It is romantic, it is sexy. All juvenile
delinquents were sexy, that's why they had 'em. The word itself is
sexy. We don't have juvenile delinquents anymore. We have
13-year-old mass murderers.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Mellencamp Lets Paintings Talk _ $15,000 a Pop</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH HARRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer John Mellencamp's art is populated
with characters from America's heartland. But these days, those
characters are more likely to be found in oil paintings than on the
radio.
   For Mellencamp, painting has provided a respite from the
pressures of rock 'n roll and the recent collapse of his second
marriage.
   His second exhibit of oil paintings opened April 12 at the
Churchman-Fehsenfeld Gallery of the Indianapolis Art League.
Mellencamp first displayed his work last year at an exhibit with
jazz artist Miles Davis in Los Angeles.
   The 29 portraits depict the singer-songwriter's family and
friends. The facial expressions created by his muted brush strokes
are always sad, and they convey the same disillusionment found in
his musical anthems about the nation's heartland and the farm
crisis.
   ``I think you can say much more in a painting than you can in a
stupid song,'' he said in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine
last year.
   ``Some days I start at seven o'clock in the morning, and I paint
until five, eat dinner and come back and paint till midnight. I
don't have to see anybody. I don't have to talk to anybody. It's
better than sex for me.''
   However, Mellencamp's wealth hardly fits the stereotype of a
struggling artist. His albums have sold millions, he records in his
own studio and he could afford to spend much of the last year in an
art studio he had built next to his home near Bloomington.
   He and his wife, Vicky, are in the middle of a divorce. They are
the parents of Teddi Joe, 8, and Justice, 4, who currently are
living with their mother.
   Mellencamp's manager, Harry Sandler, said the singer did not
want to be interviewed about his venture into the art world. ``John
wants to let the paintings stand on their own,'' Sandler said. ``He
just chooses not to speak at this time.''
   Mellencamp has not hinted that his music career is over, but it
has certainly taken an extended vacation. His growing discontent
with pop stardom surfaced in his last album, ``Big Daddy.''
   ``Never wanted to be no pop singer, never wanted to write no pop
songs,'' goes the bitter refrain of the hit single, ``Pop Singer,''
which offers Mellencamp's cynical view of today's music scene.
   He refused to tour in support of ``Big Daddy,'' and his only
stage appearance in recent months came at the Farm Aid IV concert
in Indianapolis March 7. The rousing ovation he received and his
energetic three-song performance were far removed from the solitude
of a blank canvas.
   Mellencamp organized the first Farm Aid back in 1984 with Willie
Nelson as a benefit for struggling farmers.
   ``I think people my age need to start taking their position in
the community seriously, and start dealing with local problems
within the system,'' he said in an interview with the Associated
Press. ``I don't mean standing in the back rows and throwing stuff,
any coward can do that. We tried that in the '60s and it didn't
work out too good. I mean to take affirmative action, and to make
positive steps to change in a country that needs to go through that
right now.''
   But those who have worked with Mellencamp say he is serious
about painting, and that it is not merely a hobby. Jan Royce
traveled to Mellencamp's studio several times last summer to help
him learn oil techniques.
   ``He's very bright, very eager to learn, very driven,'' said
Royce, a portrait painter from Indianapolis. ``He paints from the
heart, just as his music is from the heart.''
   Royce said the immediacy of creating a painting appeals to
Mellencamp's impatient nature.
   ``He works very fast and tries to capture what he's feeling
immediately,'' said Julia L. Muney, exhibits curator at the art
league.
   By displaying his paintings to the public and critics, Muney
said Mellencamp wanted ``some validation for himself. He wants the
public to confirm, `Am I going in the right direction?'''
   At least some buyers think so. Three of his self-portraits,
ranging in price from $2,000 to $6,000, were sold before the show
opened, Muney said.
   Reaction to the show was enthusiastic among 450 guests invited
to a pre-opening party attended by Mellencamp, Muney said.
   ``They liked the work a lot. They might have been skeptical, but
they are no longer,'' Muney said. ``I was expecting things to look
a little more folksy. I was surprised at the expertness of the
paint-handling.''
   In yet another paradox, Mellencamp chose to personally oversee
all aspects of the Indianapolis showing.
   Muney said he helped set up the exhibit, fussed over the titles
of each painting and wired the frames himself in preparation for
hanging.
   ``He'll deprecate his paintings. It's very strange because he's
serious about painting but after a while he won't be satisfied with
the results.
   ``We were looking at some of these paintings and he told me,
`This is crummy, but you can hang it anyway,''' Muney said,
gesturing toward the exhibit.
   Mellencamp insisted on removing two paintings from the exhibit
because he wasn't satisfied with them, Muney said.
   He may not want to discuss his paintings, but the prices on his
works speak volumes.
   His two least expensive works are a self-portrait of himself and
another titled ``Big J,'' showing his daughter, Justice, in a pink
dress. Both sell for $2,000. Three paintings are priced at $15,000.
They are among the largest works in the exhibit, measuring roughly
72 inches long by 48 inches wide.
   His first wife, Priscilla, is the subject of ``Cil,'' which
shows her wearing '50s-style glasses and large earrings.
   In ``The Beach or the Bar,'' said to be Mellencamp's favorite,
he portrays seven people gathered around an outdoor bar. At his
showing last fall in Los Angeles, the painting carried a $25,500
price tag. In Indianapolis, it's practically a steal at $12,000.
   ``Paintings cost more in L.A. He adjusted his prices down for
the Midwestern market,'' Muney said.
   Muney said Mellencamp asked her if his prices were too high.
``Given his name and what he's putting into them, frankly, I said
no,'' she said.
   But Muney admits few artists who have been painting for less
than two years can tag such elaborate prices on their works.
   ``Yes, they're paying for the name,'' she said of potential
Mellencamp collectors.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Writing the Best Record of the Year</HEAD>

   John Trudell can still remember the date (Jan.
14, 1979), the place (Vancouver, British Columbia) and what he was
doing (riding in a car) when he wrote his first lyrics.
   ``Suddenly, these lines came into my head, `Gently the rains of
purification wash my mind,''' recalled the 44-year-old Trudell, a
longtime Indian activist who has recorded several albums of his
poetry. ``Something told me to write them down and I've been
writing since then.
   ``I wrote a set of 20 lines. It was not something I expected.
Then I started writing and I started writing a lot. And I saw,
well, there's some reason I'm doing this and I'll see where the
writing takes me.''
   His writing found its way on tape with friend and guitarist
Jesse Ed Davis composing backing tracks for two albums. Unable to
sign with any record label, Trudell formed Peace Music and released
the songs on mail-order cassettes. In 1986, ``a.k.a. Grafitti Man''
wound up in the hands of Bob Dylan, who called it the best record
of the year.
   ``I think he was doing the Grateful Dead tour that year and he
played our tape at his concerts,'' Trudell recalled. ``The effect
wasn't monetary at that time. What it was was more recognition from
other artists.''
   So rock stars Jackson Browne, George Harrison and Bono became
fans, too, and Midnight Oil made Trudell the opening act for their
1988 tour. Trudell is a rock 'n' roll fan himself, paying tribute
to Elvis Presley in ``Baby Boom Che.''
   But while many of his co-stars are musicians who developed
politically, Trudell is an activist now giving live recitals.
   ``I knew how to handle the stage for myself, but I had never
worked it this way, with four or five other people. That's
something that I'm not trained for,'' Trudell said.
   ``I'm not familiar with the poets. I never really listened to
any poets. Their lines may have had great symbolic meanings, but
they were not real to my world. What was real to my world was
country music and rock 'n' roll music and blues.''
   Why he began writing is almost too painful to talk about, a time
he refers to as ``when things changed in my life.'' In 1979, after
leading a march in Washington and speaking out against FBI policy
towards Indians, a mysterious fire at his Nevada home killed his
wife, his three children and his mother-in-law.
   ``I realized I needed to survive, but surviving isn't enough,''
said Trudell, who soon developed a ``compulsion'' to write.
``There's got to be something else that goes with it. Otherwise, a
lot of things lose their meaning and purpose. I was trying to
figure out how I was going to deal with that.''
   He was born in Omaha, Neb., in 1946, and lived on and off the
Santee Reservation until joining the Navy in 1963.
   ``I knew the realities in my reservation and life of the
reservations and I knew the reality of racism and a whole lot
things. But when I was in the military it showed me that there were
a lot of Indians around the world as far as America was
concerned,'' said Trudell, who served in Vietnam.
   ``I had the experiences of the military, and then I went to
college for a little while. Basically, college taught me the same
thing the navy taught me. There are many realities here, and what

   He became a leader of the Indian rights movement in the late
1960s, serving as chair of ``Indians of All Tribes'' during the
occupation of Alcatraz Island in 1969, and heading the American
Indian Movement in the '70s when protests took place at Mount
Rushmore, Washington and Wounded Knee.
   ``Graffiti Man'' includes political songs such as ``Rich Man's
War,'' and love songs such as ``Stardreamer Woman.'' Trudell speaks
of his writing as the next new wave in music, sounding like a true
punk rocker who's tired of the state of the art.
   ``Because the music industry, with all its high tech, has
basically gone as far as it could go, it's stagnant. It needs a new
infusion of human energy. I think spoken word can be that infusion
of human energy.
   ``People are used to langauge being spoken, used to being talked
to,'' he said. ``In our generation, all our poets got sucked up as
musicians and are identified as musicians and that put it out of
reach of your average person. Poets are within every person's
reach.''

<HEAD>VA Plans First Review of Health Care in 25 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's military veterans are growing older
as a group, forcing the Veterans Affairs Department to re-evaluate
its health care system for the first time in a quarter-century.
   By May, VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski plans to have in place
a commission to review the ``mission'' of the department's 172
hospitals, nearly 400 outpatient clinics, nursing homes and other
facilities.
   Medicine has changed greatly since 1965, but the politics of
closing a hospital have not. In 1965, the VA barely managed to
close seven of the 15 hospitals and old soldiers' homes it had
recommended should be shut down. The emphasis has shifted from
in-hospital care to outpatient and extended care, and prevention.
   Government medicine, like private care, costs more today. And VA
hospitals must compete for federal budget dollars to pay adequate
salaries for doctors and nurses while maintaining up-to-date
equipment.
   Congress has complained that for the last 10 years the system
has been underfunded, and it says the VA needs $250 million more
this year to keep a bare-bones operation through September.
   Derwinski's proposal for the next fiscal year calls for a record
$31 billion for health care.
   The cost of medical care grows with the age of the patient. And
the main point that Derwinski has driven home in one congressional
hearing after another is the rapid change in the veteran population.
   Of the nation's 27.1 million veterans, more than one-third
served during World War II. The average age of those World War II
veterans is 68. The number of veterans age 65 or older is supposed
to peak at 9 million in 1999, according to the VA.
   Veterans 75 and older will grow from 1.4 million today to 2.6
million in 1995, and to 4.4 million in the year 2010, the VA says.
   ``By the year 2010, veterans 65 and older will comprise 40
percent of the eligible veteran population, as compared to 26
percent in 1989,'' Derwinski said in recent testimony before the
Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
   By 2010, Derwinski said, 35 percent of VA hospital patients will
be at least 75 years old, and 60 percent will be over 65.
   ``Major adjustments'' to the VA system may be needed to meet
these veterans' needs, Derwinski said.
   Like the rest of the population, some veteran retirees are
moving from their homes in the Northeast and Midwest, where many of
the older VA facilities are, to Arizona, Florida and other sunnier
states. The VA has not kept up with this population shift.
   With those trends in mind, the VA Commission on the Future
Structure of Veterans Health Care will begin meeting next month to
come up with a set of recommendations by October 1991.
   Derwinski has already promised that no facilities will be
closed, even though a city like his own, Chicago, may have three
hospitals with overlapping services.
   VA facilities, like dams and highways, are prime cuts of pork.
Congress gave Derwinski a cool reception last summer when he
proposed legislation that would give lawmakers a role in choosing
the commission members. Lawmakers were reluctant to be connected
with a group that could recommend closing a facility in their
districts.
   Congress was still up in arms over another panel's
recommendation to close domestic military bases, so Derwinski
decided to appoint his own commission.
   What the VA can do is convert a hospital to another use, such as
nursing care, and allow only one hospital in a population center to
offer expensive, specialized equipment or surgery.
   Still, members of Congress and other groups are wary of the VA
in light of past budget-cutting, when the agency was dominated by
the Office of Management and Budget. Also, there are questions of
how independent the commission will be, especially since its
support staff will be drawn from within the VA.
   ``All too often in the past, when there was talk of re-examining
the VA's mission, reducing services was the hidden agenda, '' James
N. Magill of the Veterans of Foreign Wars recently testified.
   There's a major reason for leaving some slack in the system, a
reason few like to think about: war or large-scale armed conflict.
   ``If the work of the commission will be undertaken with the
assumption there will not be a new generation of wartime veterans
by the year 2000, then the final report of the commission may not
be totally germane by the beginning of the next century,'' John F.
Sommer of the American Legion said in recent testimony.

<HEAD>State to Deal with Fastest-Growing Segment of Driving Population
_
Seniors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN F. BONFATTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SILVER CREEK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lonnie ``Layne'' Hall lives alone in
his house on the outskirts of this village, so his driver's license
is also his ticket to independence.
   The license says he's 110. He insists he's five years younger.
Either way, he is New York's oldest driver, according to the state
Department of Motor Vehicles.
   ``How many times a week do I go out driving?'' said Hall. ``Oh,
whenever I have to _ maybe once or twice. I take my laundry out. I
buy my groceries.''
   Hall has a clean record, but the DMV is reviewing regulations
dealing with the fastest-growing segment of the driving population:
senior citizens.
   New York has 1.9 million drivers over 60, said John Boffa of the
governor's Traffic Safety Committee, which is conducting the review
along with the state Office for the Aging.
   ``The basic directive was to identify ways to make driving safer
for elderly people without imposing additional burdens on them,''
said Boffa.
   Studies show the eyes provide 95 percent of the information
drivers use to make decisions, said Boffa.
   So, the width of stripes on the New York State Thruway _ 559
miles from New York City to Niagara Falls _ has been increased from
four to six inches. The rest of the state's interstates also will
get wider stripes, Boffa said.
   And over the next few years, the Thruway's 15,000 signs will be
replaced with ones that have greater reflectivity and larger
letters.
   Those changes are relatively easy. ``The more complicated issue
is how to deal with the drivers,'' Boffa said.
   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
drivers in most age groups can expect to be involved in an average
of five crashes per million vehicle miles traveled.
   The exceptions: the youngest and oldest drivers. For teen-agers,
the figure is about 30; for those 80 and over it is close to 40.
   Three states _ Indiana, Illinois and New Hampshire _ and the
District of Columbia require drivers to retake road tests after a
certain age, generally 75.
   But Boffa said New York officials are not convinced of the
merits of that because it would overwhelm the Department of Motor
Vehicles.
   It also would be discriminatory, said Steve Stiles at the
American Association for Retired Persons.
   ``The difficulty we have is when a state selects older drivers
and says, at age 65, you go through some special testing different
from everybody else,'' he said.
   ``Let's do better testing,'' Stiles said, ``but let's do it on a
performance basis, not age.''
   Boffa said New York is moving deliberately as it considers older
drivers.
   ``The automobile provides mobility and individuality for people
in many cases,'' he said. ``Self-esteem is pretty deeply interwoven
with the ability to drive. When you take that away from people, it
can be pretty devastating.''
   In rural areas, driving is essential.
   ``Automobiles are the only means of transportation for people to
get to the doctor's office and the pharmacy,'' Boffa said.
   ``We're trying to balance safety considerations with concern and
sensitivity to the elderly population,'' he added. ``It's not an
easy dilemma to resolve, to be frank.''

<HEAD>Survey Finds Elderly Want to `Age in Place'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Growing numbers of older Americans want to
stay in their homes and never move, but more than half have done
little or no planning for their housing needs in later years, a
national survey shows.
   The survey of 1,500 people aged 55 and older, commissioned by
the American Association of Retired Persons, found that 86 percent
wanted to ``age in place,'' up from 78 percent in 1986.
   Fifty-three percent had done little or no planning for their
housing. Those most likely to have done no planning were those over
75, with less than $12,000 annual income, widowed, divorced or
never married, and with health problems.
   ``In general, the people who have the strongest desire to stay
put are also the most vulnerable _ the old-old, the poor and the
widowed,'' the report said. ``They are more likely to be forced out
of their homes because of some crisis.''
   Forty-three percent of older Americans have lived in their homes
for more than 20 years, while only 17 percent have moved within the
past five years. Of those who move, 63 percent stay in the same
city or county.
   The survey found that 22 percent of older people expect to move,
but only 13 percent want to.
   ``Midlife and older people need to evaluate housing options
before a crisis occurs,'' the AARP said. ``A lack of planning may
force many older people out of their home against their wishes.''
   Those who are willing to move, especially the oldest respondents
and those in poor health, were more receptive to age-segregated
housing than they were in AARP's previous survey in 1986. Forty
percent prefer a senior citizens' building to one for all age
groups, up from 32 percent in 1986.
   The latest survey, conducted in 1989, also found a growing
expectation among the elderly that they will need help around their
homes. Sixty-five percent anticipate needing help with outside
maintenance such as mowing lawns, up from 40 percent in 1986.
Fifty-five percent expect to need help with heavy housework, up
from 33 percent.
   ``Individuals' decision to move or stay may be influenced by how
affordable, reliable and accessible home and outdoor maintenance
services become,'' the AARP said.
   The survey found that 23 percent of older people live alone,
with women, those 75 and older and those with incomes below $12,000
most likely to do so. Five percent live in a retirement community
or building planned for older adults. Twenty-seven percent live in
a neighborhood or building where a majority of the residents are 60
or older.
   The telephone survey was conducted by Market Facts Inc. in June
1989 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points. Results of the survey were released by the AARP this month.

<HEAD>Older People Express Love in Many Ways</HEAD>

   The capacity and need for sexual expression
continues into old age.
   Love and sex can be expressed in many ways. The joy of
companionship between two people can be shown by touching and
holding hands, caressing, or by conversation and doing things
together.
   While some physical responses slow with age, individuals of all
ages can benefit both physically and psychologically by expressing
their sexuality.
   Most older people want _ and can lead _ an active, satisfying
sex life. Indeed, many 80- and 90-year-old men and women have
satisfying sexual relations.
   With age, women do not ordinarily lose their physical capacity
for orgasm, nor men their capacity for erecton and ejaculation.
There is often, however, a slowing of response.
   For women, changes that occur in the shape, flexibility and
lubrication of the vagina can usually be traced to lowered levels
of the hormone estrogen during and after menopause. Many women say
that after menopause, when the fear of pregnancy and distractions
of mid-life have passed, they become especially responsive sexually.
   Most healthy older men maintain their production of sex hormones
at levels found in younger men; however, it usually takes an older
man longer to achieve full erection.
   Although a pattern of regular sexual activity helps to preserve
sexual ability, research shows a gradual decline of sexual activity
with age. Studies at the National Institute on Aging's Gerontology
Research Center found that levels of sexual activity expressed in
early adulthood usually predicted activity later in life.
   Overall health is of primary importance in maintaining sexual
relationships. In a study of 241 married men, 60 and older, 75
percent of those without mobility problems reported they were
sexually active, while only 16 percent of those with mobility
problems were.
   Even a serious disease rarely warrants stopping sexual
relations. One distressing myth is that sex is bad for your heart.
Although cardiac patients should check with a doctor before
resuming sexual activities, generally the risk of a heart attack
during sexual intercourse is about equal to the risk from climbing
a flight of stairs.
   Several diseases, such as arthritis, can limit sexual activity.
Depression, a treatable disorder, is one of the most common causes
of altered sexual motivation.
   Diabetes is one of the few diseases that can cause impotence.
However, once diabetes is diagnosed and controlled, potency may be
restored.
   Excessive use of alcohol, which may reduce potency in men and
delay orgasm in women, is probably the most widespread drug-related
cause of sexual problems. Tranquilizers, antidepressants and
certain high blood pressure drugs may also cause impotence; other
drugs may reduce sexual desire.
   Almost everyone experiences a sexual problem at some time or
another. Because sexual functioning is emotional and psychological
as well as physical, what's happening in the family or at work can
have an important influence.
   When problems occur, they should not be viewed as a sign of
aging but rather as the possible result of disease, disability,
drug reactions, or emotinal upset. Many sexual problems have
emotional or organic causes that can be treated.
   One barrier to a healthy sex life in old age stems from the
disturbing myth that older people lose their sex appeal. Negative
stereotypes are still too common. Any expression of sexual interest
by an older woman who has no partner is typically viewed as
unacceptable in our society. The ``dirty old man'' who seeks sexual
expression is the object of many jokes.
   With the increasing lifespan and improvement of the overall
health of older people, sexual activity becomes an important aspect
in overall quality of life.

   To most gardeners in this country, whiteflies are
minor nuisances that look like flakes of dandruff when disturbed.
But forget foreign invaders like killer bees, fire ants and
Japanese beetles. The ash whitefly now is in the United States.
   So far it's been spotted mainly around Los Angeles, but Dave
Langston, entomologist for the University of Arizona-State
Extension Service, says there are some suspicious areas in Arizona
and he's pretty sure confirmed outbreaks will be found this summer
in this state and possibly others.
   That would be consistent with California's experience.
``California Agriculture,'' published by the University of
California, says in the January-February edition that since the
first North American report of ash whitefly in the summer of 1988,
``populations have reached extraordinary levels in Los Angeles
County and may affect fruit and nursery crops throughout the
state.''
   The scientific name of this super whitefly is Siphoninus
phillyreae. First recorded in 1835, it's now known in most of
Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, southern Russia, Pakistan
and India. Natural enemies limit severe outbreaks in the Old World.
Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any on this continent.
California is experimenting this spring with imported biological
controls, including a tiny wasp.
   Meantime, gardeners should be prepared.
   Insecticides never have been effective against even our native
whiteflies. But for the most part, damage has been isolated.
   The ash whitefly is like comparing a tiger to a cat. Climate,
hot or cold, doesn't seem a problem. It reproduces in about 25 days
and passes through four stages, all of which feed by sucking sap
from leaves. There frequently are reports of clusters on every leaf
of a mature tree. Adults often are inhaled or caught in people's
eyes. Known hosts, besides ash trees, include citrus, olive,
pomegranate, jujube, apple, peach, pear, loquat, apricot, plum and
many ornamental shrubs and trees.
   The common name, ash whitefly, was applied in this country after
the first ones were found on ash trees. In Europe it's usually
known as the pear whitefly or peach whitefly, because of damage to
those crops. Some textbooks call it the pomegranate whitefly.
   Whiteflies were more numerous than usual last year in Arizona.
Is it possible some were ash whitefly?
   ``Not a chance,'' says Langston. ``Once you get this one you'll
know it. Trees turn yellow. Some die. It's not like now, when you
get just honeydew and whiteflies flying around. These aren't
necessarily any bigger in size, but they feed a lot more and suck
large quantities of fluid. So there's major symptoms on foliage.''
   ``California Agriculture'' says, ``Populations grow to enormous
densities ... often covering 100 percent of available foliage and
producing substantial amounts of honeydew and sooty molds.''
   To entomologists, appearance of the species is unique because of
40 to 50 tiny, dorsal, siphon tubes in the pupal stage. But
whiteflies are too small for gardeners to spot this. So damage will
be the clue.
   ``I think this summer we'll see a couple isolated cases in
Arizona where we'll have to treat for it,'' says Langston. ``What
we'll use I have no idea, since I understand nothing works.
Biological control probably is the ultimate answer.''
   Pesticide treatment, in the California experience, may be
successful in small areas, such as nurseries. Sprays or water or
insecticidal soap seem to reduce the population on smaller plants.
However, re-infestation is likely from nearby vegetation.
   Many nursery-trade groups and government agencies, including the
California Department of Food and Agriculture, are participating
with the University of California in the biological control
program. Encarsia wasps supplied by Israel and Italy have been
promising in field tests. The wasps reproduce by laying eggs inside
ash whitefly nymphs, which are eaten by the wasp larvae.
   The ash whitefly probably entered this country on plants sent to
Los Angeles either by air or sea, according to ``California
Agriculture.'' Infestation in Los Angeles County was widespread
when first reported. Just-detectable levels were found then in an
adjoining county. However, between the following spring and autumn,
that infestation grew to nearly equal that in Los Angeles.

   A senior citizens group is urging President
Bush to fill two vacancies on the Social Security Board of
Trustees, saying the public is being denied a voice in oversight of
the giant retirement program.
   The National Council of Senior Citizens said the administration
has failed to fill two positions reserved for the public, one
Democrat and one Republican, leaving the board controlled by the
three government officials on it.
   The board is charged with oversight of Social Security's giant
trust funds and of operations at the Social Security
Administration. The two public trustee positions have been vacant
since November, according to the council.
   ``The president has elected to ignore the virtues of a system of
checks and balances because that very system might further expose
unsound management principles and inadequate resources within the
Social Security Administration,'' said Lawrence Smedley, executive
director of the council.
   The council, and several Democratic members of Congress, are
urging Bush to appoint Alicia Munnell, senior vice president and
director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, as the
Democratic public trustee.

<HEAD>Legislation Proposed to Allow Senior `Olympics' to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation has been introduced in the Senate
to allow the a national seniors competition to use the word
``Olympics.''
   The first National Senior Olympics, in St. Louis in 1987,
attracted more than 2,500 participants, including athletes from
Canada and Taiwan. The competition was open to people over 55.
   However, after the 1987 games, the U.S. Olympic Committee said
the games could no longer use the word ``Olympics,'' arguing it
would ``compete programmatically or financially with the United
States Olympic effort.''
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., was among 18 senators who wrote to
the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1988 asking that the U.S. National
Senior Olympics be allowed to continue under that name, but the
committee refused the request.
   Danforth this month introduced legislation that would authorize
the U.S. National Senior Olympics to use the term and to register
the name as its trademark.
   The next games, now called the U.S. Senior Sports Classic, are
to be held June 28-July 3, 1991, in Syracuse, N.Y.

<HEAD>Aging Groups Urge Cut in Defense Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of national groups representing
older Americans is urging members of Congress to cut defense
spending to help reduce the federal budget deficit.
   Members of the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations sent a
letter to members of the House and Senate Budget Committees stating
that the reduced threat of communism around the world means massive
defense spending no longer is justified.
   Without a significant reduction in military spending,
across-the-board federal spending cuts may be necessary, which
would have a disproportionate effect on domestic programs, the
groups added.
   The groups said at least $20 billion should be cut from the
defense budget in fiscal 1991, perhaps through eliminating new
weapons systems, reducing troops, sharing defense responsiblities
with U.S. allies, and stricter regulation of defense procurement.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Americans Expect Drop in Medicare Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two-thirds of working-age Americans do
not think Medicare will provide them with the same level of
benefits that it does today when they become eligible for coverage,
according to a nationwide survey.
   The January survey of 1,001 Americans age 18 and older was
conducted for the Employee Benefit Research Institute by The Gallup
Organization. Sixty-four percent of those not yet eligible for
Medicare said they did not expect to get the same benefits as
today's Medicare beneficiaries.
   Respondents approaching retirement age were most confident in
the system's ability to pay benefits. Thirty-six percent of those
aged 55 and older said they expect the program to be able to pay
them today's level of benefits, while 19 percent of those aged
35-54 and 26 percent of those aged 18-34 had that view.
   Those surveyed were divided about whether they would be willing
to pay more now to guarantee Medicare benefits later. Forty-eight
percent said they would be willing to pay an increased Social
Security contribution during working years to insure that they
receive the current level of Medicare in the future, 47 pecent said
they would not be willing to do so, and 5 percent were unsure.
   Eighty-six percent of respondents thought they would need
additional health insurance beyond what is provided by Medicare.
   The survey showed a lack of understanding about the Medicare
program. More than half of those surveyed thought Medicare covered
individuals when they retire, rather than when they reach the
eligibility age of 65.
   Thirty-seven percent thought Medicare covers home health care,
and 26 percent thought it covered extended stays in nursing homes,
neither of which is covered.

steepest drop since December 1986, to a seasonally adjusted $794.6
billion in February, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
   Sales, meanwhile, rose 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$535.4 billion. It was the largest increase in seven months.

   Boeing Co. said it would begin producing a
new commercial jet under an agreement with three Japanese companies
that will produce parts and provide up to 20 percent of the capital
for the venture.
   The so-called 767-X is intended to fill the size gap between
Boeing's 767, another jetliner that uses some Japanese-produced
components, and its 747 jumbo jet, company officials said Friday.
   Under the agreement, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy
Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries would get a share of any
profits but would have no equity in the project and get no

   Big Mac is on the attack, warning newspapers
around the country not to reprint a full-page ad placed by an Omaha
industrialist who claims that McDonald Corp.'s food is too fatty.
   ``We think the papers just didn't check the facts,'' said
McDonald's attorney Joseph Califano. He said the fast food company
had advised the newspapers that the ad was misleading and asked
them not to publish it again.
   The fat flap began April 4, when industrialist and
anti-cholesterol crusader Phil Sokolof placed ads headlined ``The
Poisoning of America!'' in The New York Times, The Wall Street
Journal and several other papers. The ad asked McDonald's to reduce
the fat in its hamburgers by 10 percent as a ``contribution toward
lowering cholesterol levels for Americans.''

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca was the only
Big Three automaker chief executive who got a raise in 1989,
pulling in $4 million, or 8.1 percent more than he collected in
1988, the company's proxy statement said.
   Earnings last year for the nation's No. 3 automaker were down
65.8 percent from the year before.
   Iacocca's compensation in 1989 salary, stock and bonuses earned

   Here is how Tax Freedom Day has changed over
the years.
   Tax Freedom Day is the Tax Foundation's way of dramatizing how
Americans are affected by federal, state and local taxes. For 1990,
the date is estimated to be May 5, meaning that if every dollar
earned during the first part of the year were earmarked for taxes,
the average worker would be paid up on May 5.
   The figures assume individuals pay all taxes, including those
collected from corporations.

   International Business Machines Corp. said today
its first quarter profit rose a better-than-expected 9 percent over
a year ago as new products and healthy demand worldwide helped
boost revenue.
   The computer giant netted $1.03 billion, or $1.81 per share, in
the three months ended March 31. That compared with earnings of
$950 million, or $1.61 a share, in 1989.
   Revenue was up 11 percent to $14.18 billion from $12.73 billion.
   The quarterly results exceeded expectations of most analysts,
who had predicted earnings per share of between $1.35 and $1.70.
   IBM attributed the growth in earnings and revenue to continued
healthy demand across the company's product line.
   ``Our strategy of listening to our customers and improving the
competitivness of our products and services is working,'' Chairman
John F. Akers said in a statement. ``We are encouraged by our first
quarter results.''
   Wall Street also appeared optimistic. In the first half hour of
trading IBM soared $4 to $111.12{ a share in active trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. ``The application of new technology to
customers' business problems is really the key to IBM's future
success,'' said Sam Albert, who runs the computer consulting firm
Sam Albert Associates Inc. of Scarsdale, N.Y. ``Those applications
are starting to pay off.''
   In the first quarter, IBM introduced several additions to its
product line, including its RISC System-6000, a series of
workstations that offer power and solutions to scientists,
engineers and other professions.
   IBM also fabricated the world's first 16 million bit memory chip
at its Essex Junction, Vermont, facility during the quarter, and it
agreed, among other things, to work with Siemens AG to jointly
develop 64 million bit memory chips.

<HEAD>Rejects Arguments That Utility Customers OverGrand</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gulf I nuclear plant near Port Gibson, Miss., a project that cost
about six times more than original estimates.
   Middle South Utilities built the plant and ordered its
subsidiaries to share in the financing. The costs then were passed
on to consumers in the form of higher rates.
   Mississippi officials said consumers from their state are being
forced to pay unfairly to help operate other nuclear plants in the
Middle South Utilities system.
   That argument was rejected by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission when it adopted a rate formula for the four utilities.
The formula was pegged to each utility's demand for electricity
generated by the entire system.
   Mississippi officials said consumers there are helping pay for
nuclear plants that supply no power to Mississippians.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here last year upheld the
commission's rate formula.
   The appeals court said the commission properly allocated costs
by basing them on overall demand by each utility and by taking into
account that consumers in one state benefit indirectly from the
system's nuclear units that only serve customers in the other
states.
   For example, the appeals court said, a nuclear plant in Arkansas
produces extra power available to be used by utilities from the
other states.
   The case is Mississippi vs. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 89-1041.

   Internal Revenue Service Form 4868 is one of
the most-sought pieces of paper in the nation today as an estimated
6 million Americans abandon hopes of meeting the midnight deadline
for filing a federal tax return.
   Filing a Form 4868, along with a check for estimated taxes owed,
automatically extends the return deadline to Aug. 15.
   IRS offices and Postal Service branches in many parts of the
country planned extra hours today to accommodate those who put off
the inevitable.
   The IRS did not estimate how many couples and individuals were
waiting until the last minute to file. But the agency predicted
that about 34 million returns _ more than 30 percent of the 111
million expected this year _ would be filed April 7 or later.
   Residents of New England and New Yorkers who mail their returns
to the IRS Service Center in Andover, Mass., have until midnight
Tuesday because Monday is Patriots' Day, a state holiday in
Massachusetts.
   As the 1989 return-filing season drew to a close, the Tax
Foundation offered some sobering news: The average person will have
to work 125 days this year _ through May 5 _ just to pay his or her
share of federal, state and local taxes.
   That is the latest ever for the organization's ``Tax Freedom
Day.'' Last year, the nonpartisan research organization put the
date at May 3. It reached May 4 in 1981, before the
across-the-board tax cuts voted that year took effect.
   This year the foundation calculated Tax Freedom Day in each
state and found New Hampshire and South Dakota the earliest, April
19. Residents of the District of Columbia and New York will have to
work through May 23 to settle their taxes.
   The state figures are influenced not only by state and local
taxes but by personal incomes; those with higher incomes tend to
have a later Tax Freedom Day.
   The foundation attributed the growing tax burden to new laws
reducing itemized deductions, a Social Security tax increase that
will cost workers more than $10 billion this year, boosts in state
and local taxes, and a gradually slowing economy.
   ``The nation's nominal income is estimated to grow only 5.7
percent (in 1990) while the total tax take is projected to increase
7.2 percent,'' the organization said.
   Viewed from another perspective, the average worker will toil
three minutes longer each day this year _ a total of 2 hours, 45
minutes of each eight-hour day _ to pay taxes. That is one minute
longer for federal taxes and two minutes more for state and local.
   The foundation says more bad news may be on the way.
   ``The combined pressures of a persistent federal budget deficit,
demands to expand funding for new and existing programs, budget
crises in numerous states and the slowdown in income growth could
easily make Tax Freedom Day even later on our calendars,'' the
foundation said.
   The Tax Foundation calculations assume that individuals pay all
taxes, including those collected from corporations.
   About eight of 10 tax returns filed so far this year have
qualified for refunds, averaging more than $850 each.
   The IRS cautioned that taxpayers who owe but don't have the
money to pay should not let that deter them from filing by the
deadline, since that could result in separate penalties for failing
to file on time and not paying on time.
   If you cannot pay, the IRS advises, file your return on time and
attach a letter of explanation. You still may face a late payment
penalty.
   Other tips for eleventh-hour filers:
   _About 14 percent of taxpayers are making mistakes on their
returns. One of the most common is copying the wrong figure from
the tax tables. Double-check your arithmetic. If a parent or
someone else can claim you as a dependent, check the proper box.
   _If you do not itemize deductions, remember to write in your
standard deduction.
   _Attach your W-2 forms and any schedules and supplemental forms
in the proper sequence. You'll find the sequence number in the
upper right corner, just under ``1989.''
   _Your return will not be accepted if not signed; if it is a
joint return, both spouses must sign.
   _Don't forget the correct postage. Use of the bar-coded IRS
envelope expedites the mail and use of the gummed label on the
front of your return could mean a quicker refund.

   Upjohn Co. on Monday said its

   The Kalamazoo-based pharmaceutical manufacturer reported net
earnings of $114.3 million, or 59 cents per share, for the three

share, in the first quarter of 1989.
   Worldwide sales totaled $772.9 million in the first quarter, up
from $745.09 million in first three months of 1989.
   Pharmaceutical sales growth was led by Ansaid, a non-steroidal,
anti-inflammatory agent.
   Rogaine, the treatment for male pattern baldness and Motrin IB,
a non-prescription internal analgesic introduced in June 1989,
contributed to U.S. growth, according to the company. Foreign
pharmaceutical sales were down, the company said.
   ``Improvements in operating income and net earnings

<HEAD>Torchmark Begins Calling for Proxies for American General
Directors' Slate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Torchmark Corp. began calling for proxies Monday
for a slate of five independent nominees to American General
Corp.'s board who face selection at the insurance and financial
firm's annual meeting May 2.
   The action follows Thursday's ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals that stayed a preliminary injunction prohibiting
Torchmark from soliciting proxies for directors.
   American General, based in Houston, has argued that nominees for
the board had to be presented by March 3, or 20 days after it
notified shareholders of its annual meeting.
   But the three-judge panel questioned the validity of the March 3
date since American General's Feb. 15 report did not mention vital
information _ including the fact American General had expanded its
board from 13 to 15 members and that shareholders were being asked
to vote for six directors instead of four.
   Torchmark said Monday it had mailed the supplemental proxy
materials to American General shareholders over the weekend. Proxy
materials initially had been sent soliciting support for a
non-binding resolution calling for the board to seek a sale or
merger of American General.
   A spokesman for Torchmark said if the independent nominees are
elected and the shareholder resolution is adopted, Torchmark
intends to submit another bid for American General.
   The nominees on the proposed slate are Robert H. Allen, 62, of
Houston, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Realm
Resources Inc.; David A. Finley, 67, of Bedford Hills, N.Y., former
president of IBM Credit Corp.; C. Roderick O'Neil, 69, of Hartford,
Conn., former chief investment officer of Travelers Insurance Co.;
Clive Runnels, 64, of Houston, private investor; and John H. Young,
46, of Houston, president of John H. Young Inc., and president of
Jefferson Pipeline Co.

<HEAD>Higher Log, Chip Prices, Weak Paper Demand Send Profit Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weak demand for paper products coupled with
higher prices for logs and wood chips sent Boise Cascade Corp.'s
first-quarter profit plunging 57 percent, the company said Monday.
   The wood-products company said first-quarter earnings totaled
$33.6 million, or 73 cents per share, down from $78.2 million, or
$1.78 a share, in the January-March quarter a year ago.
   Sales were off fractionally to remain over $1 billion in the
first quarter.
   ``The decline in first-quarter income was the result of
continuing adverse market conditions for the company's paper
business,'' Board Chairman John Fery said in a statement.
   He also said ``delivered-log costs for the company's building
products segment were higher than those of the same period in 1989,
particularly in the Pacific Northwest.''
   Operating income from the company's paper segment, which has
accounted for up to two-thirds of Boise Cascade's income, dropped
to under $51 million in the first quarter of this year from nearly
$127 million in the same period a year earlier.
   Fery said sluggish demand for most paper grades manufactured by
the company along with higher prices for wood chips in the Pacific
Northwest hurt results.
   Operating income from the building products segment slumped to
$19.1 million from $22.1 million the previous year as log prices
were up and lumber prices down, Fery said.
   The company said its office products segment reported record
sales and operating income in the first quarter. Sales jumped 12
percent and income was up 16 percent on what Fery said was
seasonally robust demand combined with increased corporate emphasis
on operating efficiency.
   In the current quarter, Fery expects the office products
business should be seasonally down while the building products
business ``should show some improvement.''
   ``Pricing in the company's pulp and paper business should show
little change overall while we expect additional downtime
associated with several paper mill capital projects and continued
sluggish demand for some products,'' he said.

   Blue chip stocks led prices higher on Wall
Street today after a better-than-expected earnings report from
International Business Machines Corp. alleviated some concerns
about corporate profits.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 27.93 to 2,779.73
as of 2 p.m. EDT.
   The broader market lagged behind the blue chips. But advancing
issues were still ahead of decliners by a margin of 4 to 3, with
808 stocks rising, 610 falling and 527 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 99.56 million shares with two
hours of trading left.
   IBM said reported first-quarter earnings of $1.03 billion, or
$1.81 per share, up 9 percent from $950 million, or $1.61 a share,
a year earlier. Revenue was up 11 percent to $14.18 billion from
$12.73 billion.
   The results surpassed most analysts' predictions of earnings per
share of between $1.35 and $1.70. Investors, who are generally
buoyed by good earnings reports, moved into the market
enthusisastically after hearing the news.
   Big Blue's announcement dispelled some concerns that corporate
profits for the first quarter would be disappointing. The stock
market has been held in check in recent months because of
companies' poor results in 1989.
   But today's performance reflected what analysts call a
``two-tier'' market, in which traders have more confidence in blue
chip stocks than in secondary issues.
   IBM led the NYSE most active list today, rising 3~ to 111.
   Losers today included companies with disappointing first-quarter
results. Among them were banking stocks, with Chase Manhattan off &rsqb;
to 29 and J.P. Morgan falling &lsqb; to 35&rsqb; after reporting
first-quarter profit declines.
   Eli Lilly was down 1\ to 67\ after reporting a first-quarter
earnings gain.
   Among blue chip stocks, General Electric moved up ~ to 66~,
American Express rose { to 28}, and Philip Morris was up | to 42|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.91 to 189.71. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 0.08 to 357.80.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   7 Days, a weekly magazine that tried for two
years to find a readership among affluent Manhattanites, has
stopped publication, the magazine's owner announced Monday.
   The magazine had a circulation of 75,000 with 45,000 of those
copies distributed free in wealthy areas. Local retail stores and
real estate agents bought ads, but other local and national
advertisers did not, dooming the large-format weekly.
   Negotiations to sell 7 Days were revealed last month, but no
qualified buyer came forward, according to the principals.
   ``The 7 Days staff very quickly created a stylish, provocative
and useful publication,'' said owner Leonard Stern. ``But magazine
start-ups are always a risky business, and I'm deeply saddened that
we couldn't generate the kind of advertising support that their
professional efforts deserved.''
   David Schneiderman, president of Stern Publications, said the
current weakness of the Manhattan advertising market, ``coupled
with the difficulty of obtaining national advertising with a
limited circulation base, have made it impossible to continue
publishing.''
   Stern is the owner of Hartz Mountain, a diversified company that
sells pet food and develops real estate. He also owns the Village
Voice and Harmon Publications, which publishes 225 local real
estate guides across the country.

   Price said the newspaper plans to add at least one city a month

   Grain and soybean futures prices advanced Monday
at the Chicago Board of Trade, reversing an early retreat as rumors
circulated about a possible Soviet wheat deal.
   Earlier in the day, prices dipped as wet weekend weather and a
forecast for more rain in the Midwest sparked selling in the grain
and bean pits, analysts said.
   But ``talk about the Russians possibly being in the market for
wheat, 300,000 to 600,000 tons,'' encouraged a wave of buying, said
Victor Lespinasse, a grains trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   Concerns about the weather in the Midwest were tempered by
bullish rains in Brazil that could curb the South American soybean
harvest, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 3 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.69{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to

<HEAD>Citicorp Gets Jump On Interstate Banking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp on Monday gave its 132 California
branches the flagship Citibank name.
   The nation's largest banking concern, which is based in New
York, had been forced to keep its California operations separate
since it began operating in the state in 1982 after acquiring San
Francisco-based Fidelity Savings.
   But the barriers came down in last year's thrift bailout law,
known as the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act, or FIRREA.
   California is not allowing the big commercial banks from New
York inside its borders until 1991. But Citicorp does not fall
under that restriction because its state operations are chartered
as a savings and loan, formerly known as Citicorp Savings.
   The Citibank branches in California are now able to sell retail
banking services to state residents who already conduct business
with the company through its New York headquarters.
   One example of the new freedom is the right for California
branches to contact the 1.5 million residents who have a Citibank
credit card and attempt to sign them up for a checking or savings
account.
   The old regulations meant that the savings branches in
California could not cross-market to any customers with the New
York branches. The rigorous regulations forced Citicorp to hire an
independent electronic network to allow its California customers
the use of automatic teller machines in New York.
   ``There were a lot of people in California who didn't know that
Citicorp Savings was part of the largest bank in the United
States,'' said David A. Brooks, in charge of Citicorp's consumer
banking in the West.
   ``It's the end of a disadvantage for Citicorp,'' said Donald K.
Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette and Woods in San
Francisco. ``They are now in position to bring more of their
consumer products and muscle to California.''

<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. said Monday that their first quarter earnings declined over a
year ago, while another large banking company, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.,
reported higher profit.
   All three banks, however, continued to feel the pinch of the
Third World debt problem.
   Chase Manhattan said it netted $44 million, or 20 cents per
share, for the first three months of 1990, down 66 percent from
$132 million, or $1.27 a share, earned in 1989.
   Manufacturers Hanover said net income declined 6.8 percent to
$96 million, or $1.21 per share, from $103 million, or $1.84 per
share, in 1989. The 1990 quarter reflects issuance of more than 18
million shares of new stock last year.
   J.P. Morgan's quarterly earnings more than doubled to $399
million, or $2.09 per share, from $180 million, or 96 cents, in the
same period last year.
   Chase said its earnings were hurt by a $75 million increase in
provisions for losses from bad loans, mostly because of
deterioration in some U.S commercial real estate markets.
   The company added $225 million to reserves against possible loan
losses in the first quarter, up from $150 million a year ago and
$130 million in the 1989 fourth quarter.
   ``If economic conditions in domestic commercial real estate
markets deteriorate further, it is likely that the provision for
possible credit losses will continue at relatively high levels,''
Chase said in a statement.
   Total loan loss reserves at Chase on March 31 were $3.19
billion, including $2.35 billion to developing countries, compared
with $2.73 billion a year ago.
   The bank said it wrote off $325 million in bad loans in the
quarter, including $114 million to Third World countries, up from a
total of $159 million in the year-ago period.
   Manufacturers Hanover said it wrote off $246 million in loans to
developing countries in the quarter, compared with $10 million a
year ago, and $73 million for other loans, down from $89 million.
The bad foreign loans included debt exchanges on loans to Mexico
and Argentina.
   Manufactures Hanover said it added $73 million to its loan loss
reserves in the quarter, down from $87 million a year earlier. Its
total reserve against bad loans was $2.43 billion as of March 31,
including $1.97 billion for loans to developing countries. Those
figures were up from $2.21 billion and $1.68 billion, respectively,
in the 1989 quarter.
   J.P. Morgan attributed its gain largely to increases in revenue
from trading, investment management and other services. But it said
net interest revenue was down 11 percent mainly because it received
no interest on loans to Brazil in the quarter.
   The company said it increased its reserve against loan loasses
to $2.35 billion from $1.49 billion a year earlier. The bank said
it had $3.1 billion in outstanding loans to developing counties,
down from $4.6 billion a year earlier.
   The bank added $10 million to its loan loss reserves in the
quarter, same as in the year-ago period.
   J.P. Morgan also reported $265 million in losses from the sale
or exchange of Third World loans in the first quarter.

<HEAD>Steelworkers Protest Sluggish Wheeling-Pittsburgh Contract Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 50 steelworkers waved signs and
black flags outside Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. headquarters
Monday to protest sluggish contract negotiations on the fifth
anniversary of the company's bankruptcy.
   ``It's April 16th, a day of mourning,'' said Galvie Gardner, one
of the demonstrators and president of United Steelworkers Union
Local 1187 at Wheeling-Pitt's Allenport, Pa., plant.
   ``Five years of working for substandard wages,'' Gardner said.
   Most of the steelworkers wore black armbands and some carried
signs aimed at Wheeling-Pittsburgh executives that read ``Restore
Our Standard of Living,'' and ``We Helped You _ Now You Help Us.''
   The steelworkers union buttressed the protest with $4,638 in
full-page newspaper advertisements in four newspapers.
   ``The ad and the protest are both for the same purpose,'' said
Dick Fontana, a spokesman at the union's headquarters in
Pittsburgh. ``We want to protest the lack of progress in the
negotiations.''
   ``Our wages and benefits have been frozen at low levels for five
long years,'' said the ad, signed by USW International President
Lynn Williams, district directors representing USW locals in Ohio,
Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and the presidents of 11 union
locals.
   ``And Wheeling-Pitt and its creditors demand that we agree to be
frozen into second-class status for three more years,'' the
advertisement said. ``That's not right.''
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on April 16, 1985.
   Contract talks between the steelworkers and the company stalled
in February when the union accused Wheeling-Pittsburgh of refusing
to file an amended reorganization plan.
   On Monday, lawyers representing the groups discussed amendments
to the reorganization plan proposed by unsecured creditors and
supported by the company.
   The steelworkers have been working under terms of a
concessionary contract they accepted after a 98-day strike that
ended about six months after the company filed for bankruptcy.
   That contract is to remain in effect until 10 days after a
reorganization plan is confirmed by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Warren
Bentz in Pittsburgh.
   The steelmaker filed its plan on April 3 along with a plan
drafted by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., a New York investment firm. Lawyers
representing the company, the unsecured creditors, and Goldman
Sachs told the bankruptcy court last week they had reached a
compromise more favorable to shareholders.

<HEAD>Accounting Firm Plans Layoffs, Profit Pay-Out Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The accounting firm of Laventhol &amp; Horvath,
hit by costly litigation payments, is cutting profit pay-outs and
personnel, but its executive partner-elect said Monday that
business was generally strong.
   Robert N. Levine said layoffs were following the usual
accounting industry pattern of spring cuts and fall hiring.
   ``That's the cycle. Our cycle is no different this year than
it's been in past years,'' he said.
   He declined to say how many people would be laid off, but said
it would be no more than usual _ ``certainly below 10 percent.''
   ``We look at productivity and performance when we make these
cuts,'' he said. ``We don't look at a number.''
   The firm, seventh largest accounting concern in the country, has
been hit hard by lawsuits in recent years alleging poor work,
leading to large payments.
   Levine said a quarterly profit pay-out to partners in April _ to
pay taxes _ was cut in half because litigation payments reduced
taxable income and tax liabilities.
   ``We reduced that payment accordingly,'' Levine said, but added
that the firm plans to increase 12 monthly profit pay-outs this
year.
   Laventhol has 425 partners, 3,500 professional staffers and
1,200 administrative workers in 51 offices nationwide. Levine
officially becomes executive partner June 1 but is running the
firm's operations now.
   Revenue for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31 was $345 million, up
5.2 percent from the previous year, he said. Operating profit, not
counting litigation costs, was down 9 percent from a year ago.
   He said the firm took on two major clients this month that would
be the top two clients in terms of fees and number of staff serving
them. He would not name the clients.
   ``I'm looking forward to the best year we ever had,'' Levine
said.
   He said reports of hard times for the firm came from ``jealous
competitors.''
   Laventhol settled a class-action lawsuit in December with
investors in several fraudulent limited partnerships for which it
prepared audited financial statements. Insurance covered only $4.4
million of the $13.5 million settlement.
   A settlement in October with nine creditor banks stemming from a
holding-company bankruptcy proceeding cost the firm $30 million, of
which $20 million was covered. In 1988, it paid $15 million to
settle an anti-racketeering suit. That was covered by insurance, he
said.
   Besides the profit pay-out cut and layoffs, the company is
offering early retirement to some partners.
   ``We're seeking greater productivity and are streamlining our
firm,'' he said.
   According to Bowman's Accounting Report, revenue growth for
major firms slowed to 12.8 percent in 1989 from 17.25 percent a
year earlier.
   ``I think that the industry as a whole, just as American
business as a whole, has been tightening up and everyone is
scrambling to be prodcutive,'' Levine said.

1.03 cents on Thursday, the last previous day of trading. Markets
were closed for the Good Friday holiday. Contracts for delivery
further in the future also ended with substantial gains.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the Merc, home
heating oil for May delivery rose 0.89 to 54.72 cents a gallon,
adding to Thursday's increase of 0.20 cent. Later contracts posted
slightly smaller advances.
   The May contract of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade
of U.S. crude oil, edged up 7 cents to $17.85 a 42-gallon barrel
after retreating 28 cents on Thursday. The June, July and August
crude contracts had stronger increases.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery settled at $1.598 per
million British thermal units, the same as Thursday's close. The
July and August contracts also ended unchanged.
   Much of the renewed buying Monday appeared to be technical in
nature and didn't reflect a shift in sentiment toward the energy
market, analysts said. In particular, the gasoline buying was
attributed to short covering as market participants bought to
compensate for previous selling.
   A report that oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates would meet in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday
offered some encouragment to oil traders worried about the impact
plentiful oil supplies are having on prices.
   The Saudi Press Agency quoted the Saudi Oil Minister Hisham
Nazer as saying the meeting would take place. He also expressed
concern about some OPEC members violating the cartel's oil
production quotas. It was Saudi Arabia's first official response to
last week's wild price swings.
   But the positive reaction to the news was blunted by the belief
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is not about
to enact a sweeping cut in production to shore up prices.
   ``Nothing's really happened fundamentally to change the market
around,'' said energy analyst James Steel at Refco Inc. ``There's
no real reason to reverse the downtrend just because these three
oil ministers are meeting.''

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
Monday in quiet post-holiday trading.
   Gold and silver prices declined.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $375.20 a troy ounce, down 70 cents from late
Thursday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $374.60 an ounce, off 65 cents.
   Silver fell on the Comex to $5.059 a troy ounce from $5.091
Thursday.
   Precious metals and currency markets were closed in Europe on
Friday and Monday for the Easter holiday.
   The New York metals market was closed on Friday but trading
resumed Monday, while currency markets in New York were open both
days.
   Dealers said the dollar started out strong as the market
speculated the February trade data, due out Wednesday, would show
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit. A strong trade report will
likely strengthen the dollar on currency markets.
   However, dealers said the dollar fell off its highs for the day
largely on profit-taking.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed at
159.42 Japanese yen, up from Friday's 158.42 yen. Later, in New
York, the dollar stood at 159.30 yen, up from 158.705 yen late
Friday.
   In New York, one British pound cost $1.63035, down from $1.63675
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.6778 West German marks, up from 1.6722; 1.4900
Swiss francs, up from 1.4835; 5.6365 French francs, up from 5.6195;
1,232.50 Italian lire, up from 1,230.25; and 1.16885 Canadian

   Primerica Corp. said Monday its first-quarter
earnings rose 62 percent, including a 14.9 percent gain at its Wall
Street subsidiary, Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Analysts said the rise at Smith Barney was strong during a
slowdown in the securities industry, and that worse results were
expected at other firms. Smith Barney was the first brokerage to
report first-quarter earnings.
   Smith Barney reported it had a profit of $13.1 million on
revenue of $384 million in the quarter ended March 31, up from a
profit of $11.4 million on revenue of $291 million in the same 1989
quarter.
   Overall, Primerica, a diversified financial company, reported
earnings of $83.2 million, or 73 a share, on revenue of $1.44
billion. That compared with net income of $51.4 million, or 53
cents a share, on revenue of $1.24 billion in the same period a
year ago.
   Primerica reported earnings increases of 21 percent in its
consumer finance division and 37 percent in its insurance services
business, which includes A.L. Williams and Gulf Insurance.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Primerica rose 75
cents to close at $30.25.
   The rise at Smith Barney comes during a prolonged slump in Wall
Street business, including retail brokerage activity and investment
banking services such as stock and bond underwriting.
   ``If they had a good quarter I think that's notable,'' said
Lawrence Eckenfelder, who follows the industry for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in San Francisco. ``I don't think you're going to
see too many of the other firms show that kind of a gain.''
   Because Smith Barney is a subsidiary of a larger corporation,
analysts have difficulty tracking its business in detail.
   Primerica said in a statement that Smith Barney's results
``reflected good performance in most businesses, particularly in
retail brokerage, asset management and investment banking.''
   In a sign of better retail brokerage activity, Primerica said
Smith Barney benefitted from the acquisition of 16 retail offices
of collapsed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. last May.
   Analysts said individual investment activity for the first
quarter was better than in the same 1989 period.

<TEXT>
   The Aluminum Company of America said Monday
its earnings plunged 46 percent in the first quarter and blamed the
decrease in part on a $36 million decline in results from its
Brazilian affiliate.
   Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, said earnings also
suffered because of reduced shipments of fabricated products and a
drop in prices for those items and for ingots. The company said
increased sales of ingot also contributed to the slump.
   For the first quarter, Alcoa reported earnings of $148.6
million, or $1.69 a share, on sales of $2.6 billion. That compared
with earnings in the first quarter of 1989 of $276 million, or
$3.12 per share, on sales of $2.6 billion.
   Alcoa Chairman Paul H. O'Neill said the company's share of
earnings from Brazilian affiliate Alcoa Aluminio was ``at
break-even'' the first quarter of this year. During the same period
of 1989, Brazilian earnings for Alcoa amounted to $36 million, he
said.
   ``Alcoa's order rates in March were better than in recent
months,'' O'Neill said in a statement. ``Given the softness in the
economy, we are pleased by the level of first quarter earnings.''
   O'Neill said Alcoa expects its earnings from the Brazilian
venture to be hurt throughout the year. But he said the company
expects to benefit in the long run from measures being taken to
curb rampant inflation in the country.

   International Business Machines Corp. helped
give the stock market a boost Monday after reporting a
better-than-expected 9 percent jump in first quarter earnings over
a year ago.
   The world's biggest computer company, considered a bellwether
stock on Wall Street, said continued worldwide demand for its
product line resulted in stronger revenue and higher profits.
   Some analysts said the improvement was partly a rebound from a
depressed first quarter 1989, when IBM experienced shipment
problems in its mainframe computer line.
   For the three months ended March 31, IBM earned $1.03 billion,
or $1.81 per share, compared with a profit of $950 million, or
$1.61 a share, in 1989. Revenue rose 11 percent to $14.18 billion
from $12.73 billion.
   IBM's results exceeded expectations of most analysts, who were
predicting earnings per share of between $1.35 and $1.70. IBM had
been forecasting $1.55 to $1.65 a share profit, some analysts said.
   IBM closed up $3.75 to $110.87{ a share Monday in active
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The rise in IBM, considered one of the most heavily weighted
stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip
companies, helped boost the Dow by 11.26 to 2,763.06. Without it,
the Dow, which rose as much as 41 points before giving back some of
its gains, would have been little changed, analysts said.
   Don Young, a computer analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.,
called IBM's quarterly revenue gain its best in several years. He
also noted that operating income was up 33 percent to $2.13 billion
from $1.60 billion. Expenses, led by higher income taxes, rose to
$12.04 billion from $11.12 billion.
   But Young stopped short of predicting a major turnaround for
IBM, which has seen its earnings and stock performance weaken in
recent years.
   The world's largest computer maker was hurt by the dollar's
volatility and the company's difficulty in making transitions to
new products. It also has faced slow growth in demand for its big
mainframe computers, which were being overtaken by speedy personal
computers and workstations.
   William J. Milton Jr., a computer analyst with Brown Brothers
Harriman, agreed it was too early to say IBM had turned the corner
for good: ``IBM has said nothing about a resurgence. We do know
from dealer surveys in recent months that IBM has been gaining
market share in its personal computer share. As far as demand for
other products ... we don't know.''
   He said in the year-ago quarter IBM's earnings were depressed
because a chip problem caused a delay in shipment of mainframe
computers, the biggest and most profitable part of IBM's product
line.
   Still, market observers said Monday's results helped push
blue-chip stocks higher by dispelling worries that first quarter
corporate profits would be widely disappointing.
   IBM's results are among the first of a deluge of first-quarter
earnings reports expected over the next several days. Analyst say
the reports could have a major impact on the stock market in the
near term.
   IBM Chairman John F. Akers said he was encouraged by the latest
results.
   ``Our strategy of listening to our customers and improving the
competitiveness of our products and services is working,'' he said
in a statement. ``We are focusing our investments to take advantage
of the opportunities in our industry, and we are streamlining our
operations while we improve our product line.''
   In the first quarter, IBM introduced several products. Among
them were its RISC System-6000, workstations aimed at capturing a
share of the small but fast-growing market for such machines.
   The new machines have garnered favorable comments from industry
analysts, who called them impressive for their performance, pricing
and features.
   ``The application of new technology to customers' business
problems is really the key to IBM's future success,'' said Sam
Albert, who runs the computer consulting firm Sam Albert Associates
Inc. of Scarsdale, N.Y.
   ``Those applications are starting to pay off.''

<HEAD>Control Data Board Chairman Price Says Won't Seek Re-Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. Chairman Robert M.
Price said Monday he will not stand for re-election to the
company's board of directors at the company's May 2 annual meeting.
   Price said his decision not to stand for re-election ``is best
for the company,'' but did not elaborate. He continues as a
consultant under a three-year contract that pays him $450,000
annually.
   Price was replaced as chief executive in January by Lawrence
Perlman after the company posted a net loss of $680.4 million in
1989.
   He retired as a Control Data employee on March 15, and came
under fire for entering retirement with a $4.24 million severance
package after his four-year reign yielded $923.9 million in net
losses and thousands of layoffs.
   The 1989 financial report released by Control Data in March said
the company laid off 7,750 employees last year.
   ``Control Data has been through a tumultuous period,'' Price
said in a statement announcing that he will not seek re-election.
``For the past decade, the computer industry has undergone
fundamental and irreversible change. For many enterprises, that has
been fatal.
   ``For Control Data, the task of reshaping the company so that it
has the potential for future profitability and growth has been
long, difficult and painful,'' he said. ``It is clear that, under
current circumstances, my decision to withdraw from active
management at this time is best for the company.''
   Price, 60, joined Control Data in 1961 as a computer programmer.
He became close to founder William Norris and replaced him in 1986
as chairman and chief executive.
   Price will not be replaced on the company's board, and the size
of the board will be reduced at the annual meeting to 10 directors,
the company said.
   Proxies will not be voted for Price since he will no longer be a
board nominee, Control Data said, adding that no new chairman will
be named at this time.
   Shareholders of record were being notified of the change, the
company said.
   ``Bob Price has served Control Data with commitment and loyalty
for almost 30 years,'' Perlman said. ``He has many contributions
yet to make to the community in the areas of quality and of
educational and technology policy.''
   Control Data is a provider of data solutions that integrate
hardware, software and services to meet customers' complex data
collection, processing and communications needs.

   Prices closed mixed on Wall Street Monday after
the stock market was unable to hold on to a broad advance prompted
by a better-than-expected earnings report from International
Business Machines Corp.
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 11.26 at 2,763.06
after having been up more than 41 points early in the session.
   Declining issues ran slightly ahead of advancers in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 714 up, 778
down and 510 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.81 million
shares, slightly higher than 142.47 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 173.64 million shares.
   The market surged higher at the opening after IBM reported
first-quarter earnings of $1.03 billion, or $1.81 per share, up 9
percent from $950 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue was up 11 percent to $14.18 billion from $12.73 billion.
   The results surpassed most analysts' predictions of earnings per
share of between $1.35 and $1.70.
   Investors moved into the market enthusiastically after hearing
the news _ Big Blue's announcement dispelled some concerns that
corporate profits for the first quarter would be disappointing. The
stock market has been held in check in recent months because of
companies' poor results in 1989.
   The Dow Jones average was up by around 25 points for much of the
day, although the broader market began to retreat. Then, in the
last hour, program selling brought prices even lower.
   Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., said
Monday's performance reflected the continuing trend of a
``two-tier'' market, in which traders have more confidence in blue
chip stocks than in the secondary issues.
   Jarrett said a strong performance by IBM accounted for as much
as 9 points of the Dow Jones average's advance _ meaning the
average would have been little changed without the computer giant's
gain.
   IBM led the NYSE most-active list, rising 3} to 110~.
   Earnings reports also affected the performance of other stocks.
Eli Lilly tumbled 1\ to 67\ after releasing first-quarter profit
figures that fell short of analysts' forecasts.
   Banking stocks fell after reporting their first-quarter earnings
declined. Chase Manhattan fell 1| to 27} and J.P. Morgan slipped }
to 34}.
   Among blue chip issues, AT&amp;T was unchanged at 41~, Philip Morris
rose &rsqb; to 42&rsqb;, and General Electric gained } to 66}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $2.917 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.14 to 188.94.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.46 to 400.42, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index picked up 0.40 to close at 344.74.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.39 to 436.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 356.98, off 0.90.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Rise Before OPEC Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures prices rallied Monday on the eve of an OPEC
meeting called to address the market's recent steep declines.
   Home heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices also rose in
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures prices advanced;
cattle and precious metals futures declined; and pork prices were
mixed.
   OPEC's monitoring committee meeting Tuesday in Saudi Arabia was
not expected to produce major action. But traders anticipated the
13-nation cartel's ministers may take some move toward ``taming
market declines,'' said Peter Beutel, head of the energy group at
Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   The meeting, to be followed by a full OPEC session next month,
stems from a 33 percent drop in oil futures prices between January
and last Thursday, Beutel said.
   ``It's possible they may make commitments to cut some sort of
production,'' but major cuts are not anticipated, Beutel said.
   West Texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 25 cents
higher, with the contract for delivery in May at $17.85 a barrel.
The May contract for the key grade of U.S. crude declined 28 cents
Thursday.
   Heating oil settled .20 cent to .89 cent higher, with May at
54.72 cents a gallon, while unleaded gasoline settled .60 cent to
1.66 cents higher, with May at 60.21 cents a gallon.
   A possible Soviet purchase of 300,000 to 600,000 tons of U.S
wheat sent prices higher at the Chicago Board of Trade and helped
ease early weather-related pressure, analysts said.
   Traders' initial concerns about a bearish forecast for more rain
in the Midwest were tempered by wet weather in Brazil that could
curb the South American soybean harvest, said Victor Lespinasse, a
grains trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 4} cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.70{ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 4 cents
higher, with May at $2.72\ a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to 3} cents
higher; and soybeans settled 4\ cents to 5{ cents higher, with May
at $5.91 cents a bushel.
   Cattle prices declined and pork futures prices were mixed in
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The cattle market was hit by liquidations and profit-motivated
selling by traders wary of the record-high price of the April live
cattle contract, 80.55 cents a pound, said Chuck Levitt of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Whenever the market moves into that historical high ground,
people get nervous about pushing it that much further,'' he said.
   The price reflects a tight supply of market-ready cattle that is
expected to continue at least through the end of the month, Levitt
said. High prices in the pork complex also caused some jitters, he
said.
   Live cattle settled .13 cent to .35 cent lower, with the
contract for delivery in April at 80.07 cents a pound; feeder
cattle settled .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with April at
84.10 cents a pound; live hogs settled .45 cent lower to .10 cent
higher, with April at 56.15 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
settled .15 cent lower to .22 cent higher, with May at 59.17 cents
a pound.
   Gold and silver prices at New York's Commodity Exchange fell in
lackluster trading reflecting the early strength of the U.S.
dollar, analysts said.
   Gold futures prices settled 70 cents to 90 cents lower, with the
April contract at $375.20 a troy ounce. Silver prices settled 3.2
cents to 3.7 cents lower, with the April contract at $5.059 a troy
ounce.

<HEAD>Zenith Says French Company to Pay Additional $15 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. said Monday that
the French company Groupe Bull had agreed to pay an additional $15
million plus interest for Zenith's computer products business.
   That brought the final sale price to about $511 million.
   When Zenith sold the business to Paris-based Groupe Bull on Dec.
28, it received an advance payment of $496.4 million in cash,
effectively closing the sale of Zenith Data Systems.
   Zenith said in a statement that 30 days of negotiations led to
the agreement for Groupe Bull to pay the additional money.
   Groupe Bull had contended earlier that post-closing adjustments
should result in a refund from Zenith of about $49 million, while
Zenith contended Groupe Bull still owed it an additional payment.
   The dispute would have been submitted to arbitration if the
companies had not reached an agreement.
   Zenith said its first-quarter results for fiscal 1990 would
reflect a charge to discontinued operations of about $11 million,
because the negotiated final payment was less than the net
receivable that Zenith had recorded on its books at year end.
   On Oct. 2, Zenith had announced an agreement to sell the
computer unit to Bull for $91.9 million plus the adjusted net book
value of the assets sold, for a total that Zenith initially
estimated at $635 million and later lowered to an estimated $610
million.
   No one answered the telephone at Groupe Bull's U.S. offices in
Billerica, Mass., on Monday.

Broadcasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The E.W. Scripps Co. said Monday its
first-quarter earnings fell 36 percent, while its 80.4
percent-owned subsidiary, Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co., said its
profit rose 78 percent.
   E.W. Scripps, which owns 19 newspapers, earned $9.7 million, or
13 cents per share, for the quarter ending March 31 compared with
$15.1 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue edged up to $297.5 million from $294.9 million a year
earlier.
   In the publishing division, Scripps reported that advertising
revenues declined 2.3 percent to $120 million.
   ``The weakness in newspaper advertising, which had been with us
throughout 1989, accelerated in the first quarter,'' president and
chief executive Lawrence A. Leser said. ``Advertising revenues and
volume softened seriously in March.''
   Revenue from the licensing of comic characters declined $1.1
million, to $15.9 million, which the company attributed to growing
strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Scripps is
the worldwide syndicator and licenser of comics including
``Peanuts'' and ``Garfield.''
   Operating income from publishing fell to $20.3 million from
$29.3 million.
   Scripps reported its operating income from broadcasting rose 6.8
percent to $10.2 million, while operating income from cable
television was unchanged at $4.5 million.
   Scripps Howard Broadcasting, meanwhile, reported it earned $3.3
million, or 32 cents per share, in the first quarter compared with
$1.9 million, or 18 cents, for the same period of 1989.
   Revenue rose to $71.6 million from $68 million a year earlier.
   Scripps Howard attributed the improvement to higher operating
income from cable and broadcast television operations and a $1.2
million decrease in interest expenses.
   Scripps Howard owns nine television stations, five radio
stations and operates cable systems with 231,000 basic subscribers.

<HEAD>Investors Ask Continuances in Insurance Hearings on Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investor group attempting a hostile takeover
of BAT Industries PLC asked for continuances Monday in
deliberations under way in six states on its bid for
California-based Farmers Insurance Group.
   The sale of Farmers to France's Axa-Midi Assurances is a key
element of Hoylake Investments Ltd.'s strategy in its proposed $21
billion takeover of BAT, Britain's largest conglomerate.
   California state insurance regulators rejected the proposed
acquisition April 9, balking at Axa-Midi's proposal to finance its
$4.5 billion offer for Farmers entirely with borrowed funds.
   ``This brief hold will allow us to adjust our transaction to
answer the concerns expressed by U.S. regulators,'' said Claude
Bebear, chairman and chief executive officer of Axa-Midi.
   Motions for continuance were filed Monday in Illinois and Idaho.
   Illinois has conducted the most extensive review of the planned
acquisition, holding about 40 days of hearings and compiling more
than 10,000 pages of testimony and depositions.
   Similar applications will be filed in Oregon, California and
Washington, where hearings have been held, and in Texas where a
hearing is under way, an Axa-Midi spokesman said.
   Insurance departments in Arizona, Kansas and Ohio also planned
hearings on the proposal.
   The Hoylake takeover bid was announced in July by an investor
group led by Sir James Goldsmith, British investment banker Jacob
Rothschild and Australian entrpreneur Kerry Packer.
   The acquisition would be the biggest British takeover and rival
the record $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts and Co. in 1989 as the biggest anywhere.
   Hoylake has said it intends to break up the London-based BAT,
which has interests in tobacco, financial services, retailing and
paper.

<HEAD>Ford: Brazilian Uncertainty Could Hurt Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said Monday that continued
uncertainty over Brazil's economic situation could hurt the
automaker's earnings.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ford
said it has halted production temporarily at Autolatina, its joint
venture with Volkswagen in Argentina and Brazil.
   Ford cited a ``liquidity shortage'' stemming from a recent
reform package proposed by Brazil's new president that includes
price and wage freezes as well as tax increases for the stoppage.
   Ford said that although Brazil's Congress must approve the
package this month, details ``remain uncertain and change daily.''
   ``Uncertainty about further government action and a liquidity
shortage resulting from the economic reform package have caused
Autolatina to halt production temporarilly and to defer all
non-essential expenditures,'' Ford said.
   ``Continuation of the present economic situation in Brazil could
have a substantial adverse effect on Ford's earnings,'' the
document said.
   Ford owns 49 percent of Autolatina.
   The disclosure came in a filing by Ford's Dutch subsidiary, Ford
Capital B.V., seeking SEC permission to offer $500 million in debt
securities from time to time.
   Ford owns 99 percent of Ford Capital B.V., which is to serve as
a financing vehicle for Ford. Proceeds from the debt securities may
be used to help refinance short-term debt Ford incurred acquiring
Jaguar PLC, the British luxury carmaker, for $2.5 billion last year.
   Ford's 1989 earnings, $3.2 billion on sales of $82.9 billion,
were down $1.4 billion from the previous year.
   While automotive earnings outside the United States were down 3
percent, to $2.1 billion, from 1988, earnings were higher in the
Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets, according to the SEC
filing. No specific figures were given for either region.
   Ford has said it anticipates it will increase borowings in 1990.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Interim Finance Plan For GDC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday approved a
plan that allows troubled General Development Corp. to receive
$10.5 million in temporary financing for six weeks until it can
arrange permanent financing.
   General Development already owes $175 million to the eight banks
who guaranteed the interim financing, according to a schedule
submitted Monday to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge A.J. Cristol.
   Each bank will put up a proportionate amount of the $10.5
million, based on the total owed to them, under the plan submitted
by attorneys for GDC and the banks and approved by Cristol.
   General Development filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy April 6,
claiming a severe cash shortage after failing to secure $60 million
in short-term credit.
   Cristol heard objections from lawyers representing property
owners from all over the United States, who objected to a clause in
the agreement under which GDC had to give the subscribing banks
liens on the properties.
   But lawyers for the property owners appeared satisfied when they
were assured by attorneys for GDC and the banks that those who had
paid in full for their property _ believed to number about 12,000 _
would not be encumbered with a bank lien when their deeds are
delivered.
   But they were reminded that, as previously agreed, the property
owners might not get the same lot they paid for, but might get one
of equal or greater value in a portion of the development already
built. The company is not involved in property improvements for the
time being.
   Attorneys for other property owners appeared skeptical.
   ``If everybody works together, this thing will work,'' the judge
told them. ``The alternative is to see everything swept away.''
   The financing arrangement will expire June 1 and under the
proposal: ``It will be secured by a lien on all of GDC's assets
including the collateral and all other real and personal property
...''
   The collateral is identified as accounts receivable, payments
from property owners, real estate and fixtures, mortgages,
contracts and stock and various subsidiaries of General Development.
   Cristol directed that the banks participating in the new $10.5
million temporary loan should not be permitted to ``enhance their
position'' in relation to other creditors.
   Cristol's order says, in part: ``Among other things, entry of
this order will minimize the disruption of GDC's businesses and
operations as going concerns and will increase the possibility of a
successful reorganization.
   ``The entry of this order appears to be in the best interest of
the debtors, their creditors and the estates.''

<HEAD>Rockwell Net Down 36 Pct Due to Division Sale in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. said
earnings fell 36 percent in its fiscal second quarter because of a
big gain on the sale of its meter and valve business in the
year-earlier period.
   Earnings would have been up 4 percent in the three months ended
March 31 without the one-time gain a year earlier, the company said
Monday, as increased operating earnings from electronics and
graphics business more than offset declines in aerospace and
automotive business.
   ``Our results for the first six months were better than we
anticipated when the fiscal year began,'' Chairman Donald R. Beall
said.
   The company expects a modest increase in earnings-per-share for
the full year, not counting the effects of last year's divisional
sale.
   In the latest quarter, Rockwell earned $173.4 million, or 70
cents a share, compared with $270.7 million, or $1.04 a share, in
the same period a year earlier. The year-earlier net included a
gain of $104 million, or 40 cents a share, from the sale of the
meter and valve division.
   Revenue dipped slightly to $3.15 billion from $3.16 billion.
   For the first half of the company's fiscal 1990, earnings fell
28 percent to $319.2 million, or $1.28 a share, from $430.7
million, or $1.65 a share. Revenues totalled $6.04 billion vs $6.03
billion.
   Excluding the one-time gain a year earlier, earnings in the
first half were down 2 percent.
   The company said its backlog of orders on March 31 was $15.6
billion, up 24 percent from the fiscal year-end backlog of $12.6
billion. The backlog includes $3.7 billion of commercial orders,
$4.4 billion of funded government orders and $7.5 billion of
unfunded government orders.
   Rockwell, based in the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo, makes
the space shuttle and the B-1 bomber. It also manufactures
everything from printing presses to truck drivetrains to products
for cellular telephone networks.

<TEXT>
   Nintendo of America said Monday it has
filed lawsuits in several U.S. and Canadian courts to stop the sale
of counterfeit copies of its popular video games, and the company
promised more suits.
   ``What's happening here is an outrageous theft of Nintendo's
valuable intellectual property rights,'' said Howard Lincoln,
company senior vice president. He said counterfeit cartridges were
being manufactured in Taiwan.
   Nintendo said lawsuits for copyright infringement have been
filed in federal courts in Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Tampa,
Fla., and in Canadian federal court in Ottawa against defendants in
Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia.
   The company said it would file additional suits within two
weeks. It said it was acting because counterfeit activity has grown
markedly the past month.
   A sting operation in Wilmington, N.C., led to the arrest
Thursday of four people and the seizure of 700 counterfeit
cartridges after the company joined forces with undercover U.S.
Customs agents, who allegedly were offered the cartridges for
$60,000, Nintendo said.
   The company said it was aiming its legal actions against
counterfeiters, video rental outlets and other retailers,
distributors and importers who rent or sell the cartridges.
   A typical counterfeit cartridge contains many games, is about
half the size of Nintendo's cartridges and come with an adapter to
use on Nintendo's system, the company said.
   Lincoln said Nintendo does not sell ``multiple game cartridges.''
   The lawsuits ask that defendants be stopped from distributing,
advertising, promoting and selling counterfeit cartridges. Nintendo
also seeks monetary damages.
   The four people arrested in North Carolina included a Taiwanese
couple, Sylvie and Paul Sun, said Nintendo. Also arrested were Kenn
Ketchum and Brad Ison of Tampa, Fla. Each was charged with
trafficking in counterfeit goods.
   Ketchum and Ison were named, along with Gary Brinson, in the
suit filed in Tampa, said Lynne Gray, of the public relations firm
of Hill and Knowlton Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Named in the suit filed in Los Angeles was Herschel Naghi, doing
business as Space Video, said Gray.
   Defendants in the Minneapolis suit included Bigelow Distributing
and various Bigelow Video stores in several locations, Robert
Bigelow, Laurence Bigelow, Niles Bigelow, Sunshine Video, Century
Video &amp; Tanning, Rodney William Reif and Patricia Ann Reif, Valley
Video, Chanhassen Video, Mr. Movies, The Video Library, United
States Video, Video Update and Video Shuttle Network, as well as
individuals.
   Nintendo said it has had to battle counterfeiters before. In the
early 1980s, the company initiated more than 30 lawsuits across the
country to stop production of counterfeit copies of the game Donkey
Kong.

<HEAD>Resorts Plans To Sell Paradise Island Holdings To Pay Off Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McMAHON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc. said Monday it
lost $303 million in 1989 and planned to sell its lucrative
properties in the Bahamas to help pay off its debts and emerge from
bankruptcy.
   Resorts also filed an amended bankruptcy reorganization plan
that called for bondholders to exchange their securities for new
debt and 78 percent of the company's stock. The plan made minor
changes to a proposal the company filed late last year.
   Spokesman Harris Diamond said the property sale would erase
hundreds of millions of dollars of debt Resorts has been carrying
since entertainer Merv Griffin purchased the company from Donald
Trump in late 1988.
   ``If you look at the company debt structure ... it just made the
most sense,'' Diamond said. ``Assuming everything goes OK, we're
hoping to be out of bankruptcy by summer.''
   The Chapter 11 reorganization plan, which will reduce Griffin's
stake to 22 percent of Resorts stock, has to be approved by the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, owners of two-thirds of the bonds and the
state Casino Control Commission.
   The government of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas also must
approve any deals involving Resorts' holdings, which include a
casino, four hotels, a golf course and undeveloped land on Paradise
Island and Grand Bahama Island.
   Resorts said it posted a net loss of $302.8 million for 1989,
compared with $381.4 million a year earlier. Last year's loss
reflected a writeoff of $181.3 million in goodwill, or the amount
by which Griffin's purchase price exceeded Resorts' assets, and
interest payments of $121.5 million.
   Operating losses were $7.8 million in 1989, compared with
profits of $28.4 million in 1988.
   Industry observers say the sale of Paradise Island, with
estimated profits of $25 million to $30 million a year, makes sense
for Resorts and will help it to refurbish its sagging Atlantic City
casino.
   ``Paradise Island is a very successful place and it ought to be
very marketable,'' said Dan Lee, a gaming analyst with First Boston
Corp., who added that the resort is the leading casino in the
Caribbean.
   ``Something had to be done. The bondholders were insisting on
cash and there was a building that needed refurbishing,'' he said.
   ``If they can sell and recoup substantial values, then it would
make sense to go forward,'' said Ron Grobeck, a research analyst
with R.D. Smith, a New York brokerage that specializes in
distressed securities.
   Grobeck said Resorts has 200 undeveloped acres in Paradise
Island and 1,500 undeveloped acres on Grand Bahama.
   ``They are not generating any value,'' he said. ``To the extent
that they could put it on the block, maybe it makes sense to cash
in.''
   The amended reorganization plan calls for holders of certain
Resorts debt to receive an additional $20 million in new bonds. It
also calls for Griffin to invest a total of $26 million into the
company.
   Resorts' outstanding debts include about $600 million in bonds
that were issued before Griffin's takeover and another $325 million
of junk bonds Griffin issued to finance the acquisition.
   The reorganization blueprint keeps intact plans for a
``fraudulent conveyance'' lawsuit against Trump, for which a $5
million litigation fund is to be established.
   The suit would claim that something of value was transferred to
Trump in the buyout without him giving a fair return to the
company. One such asset is the Taj Mahal, which Trump bought for
$273 million as part of his deal with Griffin after Resorts spent
about $500 million on it.

   Mack Trucks Inc. said it has gotten a
15-day extension from its creditor banks to help prepare a
restructuring of its more than $148 million in debt.
   Joe McDevitt, Mack assistant treasurer, said seven of the 10
banks require the company to maintain a certain ratio of assets to
liabilites, which it has been unable to do.
   The banks previously had waived that requirement until April 15,
he said, and they agreed to extend the waiver Monday until April 30.
   ``This will give us more time to prepare the paperwork for the
deal that's closing ... and resolve the loan restructuring at
certain subsidiaries,'' McDevitt said.
   Mack, which now has separate agreements with each of the 10
creditor banks, is restructuring its debt and forming a secured
syndicated credit agreement with all the banks, McDevitt said.
   The company reported a $185.4 million net loss for 1989,
reflecting a big drop in demand for commercial trucks generally
last year.
