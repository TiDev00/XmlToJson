<HEAD>Committee Approves Change in Presidential Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's presidential primary
would be advanced from June to the first Tuesday in March under
legislation approved Wednesday by a two-house conference committee
of the state Legislature.
   The proposal, sent to the floors of both houses for final votes
before their Aug. 31 adjournment, would place California's primary
just one week after New Hampshire's first-in-the nation primary.
   California political leaders of both parties support the change,
saying it would transform the primary from a political afterthought
in the presidential sweepstakes to what could be the dominant early
primary.
   ``We're trying to become a stronger player in national
politics,'' state Sen. Ken Maddy of Fresno, the Republican leader
in the Senate, said Wednesday.
   However, the 5-0 vote of the two-house committee for the early
primary plan still doesn't assure its passage. Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown, a Democrat, said the shift wouldn't be approved in
unless it won support from all the party leaders in both house.
   Maddy said he and many Republican legislators prefer a plan that
moves the presidential primary to March and all other primaries to
September. The plan sent to the Senate and Assembly floors leaves
the other primaries on the first Tuesday in June, the same date as
the presidential primary.
   The last time the state proved crucial in the primaries was
1972, when George McGovern used his victory over Hubert Humphrey to
capture the nomination at the National Democratic Convention. Barry
Goldwater's victory over Nelson Rockefeller in California's 1964
primary was the last time the state played a role in picking the
GOP nominee for president.
   The lack of influence rankles many in the state, especially
because California sends by far the largest delegations to both
national conventions.
   Supporters of the measure sponsored by Democratic Assemblyman
Jim Costa say that because of the state's late primary,
presidential hopefuls of both parties ignore California except for
brief visits to raise money for their races in New Hampshire, Iowa
and other early primary and caucus states.
   Opponents of the move say it would favor well-heeled
presidential candidates, giving those who can raise early campaign
contributions an edge in the nation's largest state.
   The dispute over whether to leave California's congressional,
legislative and other primaries in June or shift them to September
involves complicated and obscure tactical considerations. Political
strategists argue about which party would benefit from shortening
the period between the primary and general election from five to
two months.

<HEAD>Police Rally For Officer Who Killed Teen</HEAD>

   More than 2,500 police called for the
ouster of Gov. Jim Florio and Attorney General Robert Del Tufo
during a rally Wednesday supporting a white police officer who
fatally shot a black teen-ager.
   Organizers said police are angry because the state has empaneled
a second grand jury to investigate the April 10 shooting of
16-year-old Phillip C. Pannell by Teaneck Officer Gary Spath.
   ``We're here to send them our message, which is they have to
stop using Officer Spath and (partner Wayne) Blanco as pawns in
their political game,'' said Steve Librie, president of the Teaneck
Policemen's Benevolent Association. ``They're trying to make Spath
a scapegoat for everything that's wrong with society.''
   The officers rallied outside the Bergen County Courthouse in
Hackensack, chanting ``Dump Del Tufo, Dump Florio.'' They then
marched several miles from Hackensack to Teaneck and congregated
outside a municipal building.
   Meanwhile, about 40 people gathered outside a Teaneck school for
a prayer vigil in memory of Pannell.
   ``Those 2,000 officers are walking strong with their guns,''
said Donna Jackson, a Newark coordinator for the United Youth
Council, a black organization that has supported the Pannell family.
   ``We sit back and say, `It's not affecting me or my family.' You
think that, you're wrong. Next time it could be you,'' Jackson said.
   After the shooting, police and witnesses offered sharply
different accounts of the moments leading up to the incident.
   Spath and Blanco, who were responding to a complaint of a youth
with a gun, have said Spath fired only when he saw Pannell reaching
for a gun at his waist. Witnesses said Pannell had his hands in the
air when the shot was fired.
   A second grand jury is to review the evidence because of a
faulty autopsy report to the first grand jury by Bergen County
Medical Examiner Lawrence Denson. Del Tufo said medical evidence
indicates that Pannell's hands were in the air.
   The rallying police officers _ black and white _ chanted, ``He
had a gun.''
   Nutley Police Officer Steven Rogers said more than 2,500
officers attended the rally.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the
mighty Bundesbank, is supervising the painful transformation of
East Germany into part of a capitalist state.
   He assumed the job with reluctance, but appears to be the right
man for it.
   With a keen sense of politics, the man in charge of West
Germany's central bank swept his doubts aside and accepted the role
thrust on him by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to unite the two
Germanys more quickly than anticipated.
   Only days before Kohl announced his plans for monetary union of
West and East Germany, Poehl still spoke of it cautiously as
something that would take at least a year.
   Insiders say Poehl was furious over Kohl's failure to consult
him, but the banker saw quickly which way the political weathervane
pointed. He accepted Kohl's decision and the West German mark
became East Germany's currency July 1.
   ``During the monetary union, Poehl the politician had no trouble
silencing Poehl the economist,'' said Der Spiegel, the West German
news magazine.
   When the government and public opinion wanted monetary union,
Poehl ``could not play the role of a nagging accountant,'' it said.
   Poehl, opposed to a 1-1 exchange rate of East and West marks,
succeeded in persuading the government to limit the amount that
could be exchanged at the generous rate.
   ``The government went along with many of his suggestions and the
Bundesbank is now firmly in control of the monetary policy,''
Warren Oliver, an economist in London, said in a telephone
interview.
   East Germany surrendered its monetary sovereignty to the
Bundesbank.
   As guardian of the stability of the West German mark, one of the
world's most powerful currencies, Poehl was concerned about the
possible inflationary effect of giving East Germany's hungry
consumers 25 billion marks ($15.6 billion) overnight.
   Keeping inflation in check has been one of Poehl's primary jobs
since becoming president of the central bank in January 1980.
   Inflation is one of the worst economic ills to Germans because
the Weimar Republic's worthless currency contributed to the rise of
Adolf Hitler.
   Bundesbank autonomy is guaranteed by the constitution, but the
government chooses its president. The chancellor gave Poehl a
second eight-year term in 1987, even though the banker belongs to
the left-leaning Social Democratic Party, the opposition to Kohl's
center-right government.
   The central bank presidency is the best-paying government
position in Germany _ 600,000 marks a year, or $375,000.
   Some officials in the more conservative wing of Kohl's coalition
wanted Poehl replaced but could find no one with his experience and
international reputation.
   Analysts agree the strength of the mark would have suffered if
Poehl had not been reappointed.
   Poehl, 60 years old and slightly stocky, is the longest-serving
central bank chief in the seven leading industrialized nations and,
Oliver said, ``the most successful central banker of the last
decade.'' A word from Poehl is enough to move world financial
markets.
   From the sprawling Bundesbank headquarters on the outskirts of
Frankfurt, Poehl travels regularly to Washington and other world
capitals. He also is a ranking officer of the International
Monetary Fund.
   He was born Dec. 1, 1929, in Hanover, and earned an economics
degree in 1955. In seven years as an economics journalist for
several publications and radio stations, he built good personal
relations with important officials.
   After joining the Economics Ministry in 1970, Poehl became an
adviser to Chancellor Willy Brandt the next year and, in 1972, the
ministry's No. 2 man.
   While at the ministry, he played important roles in freeing
exchange rates and creating the European Monetary System. He joined
the Bundesbank as a vice president in 1977, three years before
becoming its chief.
   Insiders say Poehl is easygoing and relaxed at his job and once
prepared himself for the Washington heat by removing his tie and
socks in the plane. He is fluent in English, loves to play golf and
has a wit often laced with sarcasm.
   He is said to have told table companions at a Washington dinner:
``We'll probably have to feed Soviet soldiers now, but luckily
their living standard is lower than that of the American
soldiers.'' About 380,000 Soviet soldiers are stationed in East
Germany.
   Oliver, the London economist, said Poehl was regarded as
``collegial, quite open. He is very cosmopolitan and is able to
tolerate differences of style.''
   ``Perhaps that comes from his journalistic background, and
journalists tend to go to him at big meetings because they know he
has something to say,'' Oliver added. ``The Bundesbank is very
successful in the public relations area.''
   Poehl endorses a common European currency and European central
bank in principle, but has expressed doubts whether governments are
ready to allow such a bank the necessary autonomy.
   Analysts say Poehl would be a perfect choice to head a European
central bank.

   A 25-year-old woman carrying her baby
daughter was stabbed to death when she urged a man using a public
telephone to finish his call, police said today.
   Local press called the killing an example of escalating crime in
cities and the loss of traditional values in changing South Korean
society.
   Police said Kang Ho-sun, 28, admitted stabbing Ahn Moon-sun in
the neck Tuesday after Mrs. Ahn became angry when he did not finish
his call.
   Mrs. Ahn died at a nearby hospital. Her 5-month-old daughter,
who was strapped to her back, was unharmed.
   Kang, 28, was arrested immediately by police outside Seoul's
Yonsei University and was charged with murder.

   They were just four of the millions who
perished in Nazi camps. But in the shadow of death, the Jewish
composers created a musical legacy that has outlived the horror of
their fates.
   Today, a musician is organizing performances of the almost
forgotten pieces by Gideon Klein, Pavel Haas, Viktor Ullmann and
Hans Krasa _ musicians imprisoned in a concentration camp in
Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia.
   ``It's amazing and it's inspiring,'' says Mark Ludwig, a Boston
Symphony Orchestra violist. ``Our mission is ... to make the public
aware not only of the great talents of these artists but there's a
spiritual resistance, a spiritual form of resistance which is also
very inspiring.''
   Ludwig spent two years tracking down scores from composers at
the Nazi camp in Terezin, Czechoslovakia, a village north of
Prague. He concentrated on the four composers, who had promising
careers in pre-war Prague. Krasa's ``First Symphony,'' for example,
had been performed by the Boston orchestra in 1926.
   Many of the scores came from the state Jewish museum in Prague
and the Terezin National Monument, where they had been deposited
after the war and largely ignored. Others came from survivors
entrusted with the music.
   Some of the pieces, mainly chamber music, express ``a great deal
of pain and desolation,'' Ludwig said. ``There are also others that
are reminiscent of times past, good times, if you will, a way of
momentarily distracting the audience from their environment.''
   ``People are just so moved by the power because the soul is
coming out,'' he said during a recent interview at the orchestra's
summer home. ``You don't have to be so sophisticated, it just
touches you, it's so deeply felt.''
   The concentration camp known as Theresienstadt originally was a
walled garrison town. The camp served as a way station for
transports to death camps in the east and as the center of a Nazi
propaganda effort.
   At the camp, the musical community sometimes had to keep out of
sight, holding rehearsals in attics and basements of the town.
   After they learned of the makeshift concerts, Nazi guards at
first allowed them as part of their efforts to create the
appearance of a model camp. Later, the cultural activities often
were forbidden as a disciplinary measure.
   Ullmann wrote a short allegorical opera about life in the camp,
which was rehearsed, but was not allowed to be performed. Ludwig
said the composer almost took the score with him when he was sent
to Auschwitz, but was persuaded by friends to leave the music
behind.
   To bring the music before the public, Ludwig founded the
non-profit Terezin Chamber Music Foundation. So far, concerts have
been held in Worcester and at a Holocaust memorial service at the
Massachusetts Statehouse. Concerts are planned next year for
Amsterdam, Boston and the Berkshires.
   The pieces, mainly short works such as string trios, quartets
and sonatas, carry melodic Slavic influences and, Ludwig believes,
are destined to become part of chamber music's repertoire.
   Next year's programs include music that hasn't been heard since
it was first written and performed in the concentration camp _ a
time when the musicians probably were never sure of their fate,
Ludwig said.
   ``You still hold that hope. When you think about it, creativity
_ that's a form of hope, too. Even in a horrendous environment, in
the worst of times, if one is creating, one is expressing, there is
a need, there's a hope.''

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has forced
Saudi Arabia to make a fundamental and perhaps permanent change in
its public approach to the outside world.
   The invasion forced Saudi Arabia, long equivocal about its links
with the West, to publicly ally itself with the United States,
despised by many Arabs for its support of Israel. The United Arab
Emirates and other Persian Gulf states have followed Saudi King
Fahd's lead, declaring their support for U.S. forces on their soil.
   For more than four decades, the Saudis have tried to conceal
their close economic cooperation with Americans and the U.S.
military presence in the cradle of Islam. But the Aug. 2 overthrow
of Kuwait's royal family, the oldest dynasty in the gulf region,
underlined the fragility of the gulf kingdoms and sheikdoms.
   Saudi unease had already been triggered by the collapse of the
shah of Iran in the 1979 Islamic Revolution across the gulf.
   King Fahd had little choice in the face of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's military actions but to call in the Americans and
their allies to protect his kingdom and its vast oil fields.
   ``The only alternative was unthinkable _ to sit back and watch
Saddam overrun the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and, eventually
Saudi Arabia itself,'' said an Arab diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Despite lavishing billions of dollars on sophisticated military
hardware over the years, King Fahd's untested, 120,000-strong armed
forces are no match against Saddam's battle-seasoned hordes.
   Like other Arab rulers, the Saudi royal family saw that
grass-roots support for Saddam among the region's 200 million
Arabs, long envious of the gulf's oil riches, was a mushrooming
radical force.
   Since King Abdul-Aziz founded the al-Saud dynasty in the 1920s
by conquering rival Bedouin clans and forging the Saudi state, his
descendants' policy has been survival at any cost.
   Like other gulf oil states, the Saudis have long avoided discord
by sheltering behind their Islamic piety and consensus politics.
   U.S. ties date back to 1945, when Abdul-Aziz made an unwritten
alliance with the United States. The Americans, edging out the
British, secured the first oil concessions in 1933, giving
Washington strategic interests in Saudi Arabia.
   Fahd told his estimated 8 million subjects two weeks ago that he
had invited the Americans to help him reinstate the al-Sabahs in
Kuwait and defend Saudi Arabia against a possible Iraqi attack.
   Since then, the Americans have been pouring troops and materiel
into Saudi Arabia. Fahd has sought to placate his Islamic critics.
   ``These forces from friendly powers are here temporarily ... and
will leave as soon as the kingdom so demands,'' he stressed in a
nationwide statement Aug. 9. He reiterated it Aug. 21.
   But with Saddam deploying an estimated 200,000 men in and around
Kuwait and showing no sign of pulling out of the former emirate,
the Americans may be around for awhile.
   ``Everyone accepts that there's going to be a long-term American
military presence,'' said a senior gulf official, who spoke on
condition he was not named. ``It's no secret that Saudi Arabia and
other gulf countries willingly accept whatever it takes to ensure
their stability. If necessary, they will accept an increased
American presence here.''
   That's a dramatic about-face for the Saudis, who have long
sought to play down their Western orientation, while paying lip
service to Arab nationalism and the Palestinians' struggle against
Israel.
   The Saudi rulers have overseen the transformation of a desert
backwater into a modern state, all the time trying to prevent
progress from undermining its Islamic roots.
   Much of the royal family's legitimacy rests on Islam. A few
years ago, Fahd stressed this by declaring himself the guardian of
Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   Allowing American infidels in to protect the holy places has
drawn resentment from Moslem quarters.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has for years berated the Saudis
for befriending the United States and urged Moslems to stop making
the annual pilgrimage to Mecca as long as ``it remains under
American military occupation.''
   Iran's Islamic revolutionaries have constantly reviled the Saudi
leaders as ``American stooges'' and called for the downfall of the
royal family.
   The Saudis have long discouraged outsiders peering into their
world. The thousands of Westerners, Americans and others, who keep
the oil flowing, live mostly in their own compounds.
   That too may be changing, with thousands of American GIs
flooding into the once-veiled kingdom.
   American and other Western journalists have been allowed in and
events in Saudi Arabia are now daily on prime-time television.
   Saudi newspapers, which until recently ignored controversial
subjects, are now reporting the harsh realities facing the kingdom.
   Arab reporters, however, have been advised to refer to the U.S.
presence as part of a multinational force comprising Egyptian,
Moroccan and other Arab units as well.

   U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson and Gov. Mike
Sullivan handily won their primary races Tuesday, while GOP
gubernatorial candidate Mary Mead took an early lead in an unusual
two-woman race for her party's nomination.
   With 154 of the state's 471 precincts reporting, Mead had 69
percent of the vote to state Rep. Nyla Murphy's 31 percent.
   Simpson, the Senate minority whip, was easily winning his third
Republican nomination with 83 percent of the early vote.
   It wasn't clear which of six little-known Democrats would win
the right to challenge Simpson. Kathy Helling, a 32-year-old
college student, and Al Hamburg, who was convicted last year of
forging names on a campaign petition, were the top vote-getters in
early returns.
   As it was four years ago, Sullivan walked away with the
nomination Tuesday. He got 88 percent of the early vote in his
primary contest with motorcycle mechanic Ron ``Suds'' Clingman.
   The governor said he would have preferred to face stiffer
competition.
   ``I have to say that when you watch people debating the issues
on the other side, you wish you had some primary opposition so you
could talk about the issues,'' said Sullivan.
   The hunt for the GOP gubernatorial nomination pitted Mead, 55,
the daughter of former Gov. and U.S. Sen. Cliff Hansen, against
Murphy, a 59-year-old Casper woman who has served the past 12 years
in the state House of Representatives.
   Mead's campaign stressed her skills as a rancher and
businesswoman and attacked Sullivan's economic development efforts.
   Murphy, in turn, accused Mead of having a negative attitude
toward Wyoming and of failing to propose solutions to the
shortfalls she perceived.
   Sullivan largely ignored the primary campaign and stuck close to
his gubernatorial duties.
   U.S. Rep. Craig Thomas was uncontested in the primary. Elected
last year to fill Dick Cheney's unexpired term in office, Thomas is
seeking his first full-term in the House this fall. Also unopposed
was his Democratic challenger, Pete Maxfield, a University of
Wyoming law professor.

<HEAD>Bulgaria Imposes Travel Ban on Romanians Because of Cholera</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 Romanians were pulled off a
train by Bulgarian authorities after Bulgaria imposed travel
restrictions because of a cholera outbreak in Romania.
   Dimitar Dimitrov, Bulgaria's consul in Bucharest, said Tuesday
that the new restrictions were imposed to protect Bulgarians
against the cholera epidemic, which broke out last month in
Romania's Danube delta area.
   Seventy-four cases have been reported in the Danube region since
mid-July. Thirty-one victims are still hospitalized.
   Dimitrov said the travel restrictions would allow individual
Romanian travelers to transit through Bulgaria for no longer than
30 hours. They are also prohibited from bringing Romanian
foodstuffs or beverages into the country.
   Those traveling in organized group tours, which typically
provide room and board, will be able to stay in Bulgaria for longer
periods, Dimitrov said.
   On Tuesday, a group of 300 Romanian tourists, most of them
gypsies, were taken off a train by Bulgarian authorities at the
Russe-Girgiu border crossing because of the new regulations, the
Bulgarian state news agency BTA reported.
   Some scuffled with police who tried to put them onto a train
back to Romania. The Romanians pulled the emergency brake on the
return train and jumped off, scattering before police could stop
them, BTA said.
   The news agency said the Romanians also were carrying large
quantities of goods, apparently to be sold on the black market.
   East Germany and Czechoslovakia have both imposed travel
restrictions on Romanians. Many Romanians travel abroad to buy or
sell goods or to seek better living standards.
   Bulgaria is a major transit route for Romanians who travel to
Turkey for purchasing goods _ some of which are sold on the
Romanian black market.
   Under the Bulgarian government decree, Bulgarians are
temporarily banned from private travel to Romania.

   Former hostage Frank Reed says his 14 Western
comrades in Lebanon are forgotten, deprived, sick men whose plight
is worsened by the new hostage crisis in the Persian Gulf. ``God
forbid they come out in a box,'' he said.
   ``What's frightening is that they could be there for 10 years,''
he said in an interview Tuesday. ``They told me the day I was
captured, `You're going to be here for 20 years.' I'm a very lucky
man to be out.''
   Reed said the 3,000 Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait will take
priority over the six Americans and eight other Westerners held in
Lebanon by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is
believed to be an umbrella group for Shiite Moslem terrorists.
   ``I think it it will have an overall effect of them being put
further and further down in the agendas,'' said Reed. ``As far as I
know, the American government is doing nothing.''
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he had no
comment on Reed's remarks.
   Reed implored the American public to ``start writing people, the
president, their senator, their representative, to make them aware
of the humanity that supposedly exists in this country.''
   ``For God's sake we're talking about almost six years that Terry
Anderson and Tom Sutherland have been in captivity,'' he said.
``They should be freed. When I left them they were sick. This is
very degenerating.''
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the hostages. He has been in
captivity nearly 5{ years. Sutherland, 59, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut, has been held for
a little over five years.
   The other American hostages are: Joseph Cicippio, 59, acting
comptroller at the American University in Beirut; Edward Tracy, 59,
West Beirut resident; Alann Steen, 51, a communications instructor
at Beirut University College, and Jesse Turner, 42, professor of
mathematics and computer science at Beirut University College.
   Reed, 57, lives in suburban Malden. He was the founder and
president of the Lebanese International School. He was freed in
April after 3{ years in captivity. No American hostages have been
released since then.
   Reed has criticized the Bush administration for its stand
against negotiating with terrorists.
   The demands of the kidnappers in Lebanon include the release of
prisoners held by Israel in southern Lebanon and terrorists jailed
in Kuwait and Western capitals.
   There are conflicting reports on the fate of the prisoners in
Kuwait. Some say they escaped after the Iraqi invasion. Others say
they have been killed. Some suggest they have been moved to
Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
   If the prisoners in Kuwait got out, the Western nations now have
less to offer to the kidnappers to free the hostages, Reed said.
   The conditions under which the Americans in Iraq and Kuwait are
being held are not known. In Lebanon, the hostages have been
blindfolded, chained and malnourished. Reed said he was badly
beaten, apparently for trying to escape twice, and poisoned with
arsenic.
   Reed said he was sympathetic to American families who have
relatives among the hostages in Iraq and Kuwait. ``But I believe
they're a hell of a lot safer in that situation than the people I
left behind are,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bernard Wex, Designer of Longest Suspension Bridge Span, Dead at
68</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bernard Wex, designer of the world's longest
suspension bridge span, has died, according to a newspaper report
today. He was 68.
   The London newspaper The Independent reported that Wex died on
July 31. It stated no cause of death and gave no explanation for
three-week delay in reporting it.
   Wex designed the Humber Estuary Bridge in northeast England,
which was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981.
   The Guinness Book of Records lists its main span, measuring
4,626 feet, as the world's longest suspension bridge span.
   As partner-in-charge with the firm of consulting engineers
Freeman Fox and Partners, Wex both designed the bridge and directed
its construction.
   Wex graduated with honors in civil engineering from London's
prestigious Imperial College in 1951 and then joined Freeman Fox,
working under the internationally renowned bridge designer Gilbert
Roberts.
   Wex was involved in the design of several important bridges
under the guidance of Roberts and later Oleg Kerensky. They
included the Auckland Harbor Bridge in New Zealand and the Severn
and Forth Road Suspension Bridges, both in Britain.
   He was honored by the queen for his services to engineering by
being made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1982.
   He leaves a wife and two sons. The report did not mention
funeral services.

<HEAD>NJ Senator's Visit to Iowa Seen as Testing Presidential Waters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley knows about
making the right moves when he sets foot on the farm soil of Iowa.
   Almost 40 years ago, as a Little Leaguer from Missouri playing
baseball in a regional championship in Ottumwa, Iowa, he stepped
off first base and was tagged out. The sting of being caught off
guard has stayed with him.
   A more careful Bradley recalled the early misstep this week
during his third trip to the state since 1988.
   Bradley's visit to the home of the nation's first Democratic
presidential caucuses raised questions asked any time a politician
of national repute steps into the Iowa limelight.
   ``I don't know that much about him,'' said Elaine Baxter, Iowa's
secretary of state. ``I feel good about the things I've heard _ the
respect of his colleagues, a very substantive person, able to reach
out to those voters in the middle. I would need to see where he
stands on women's issues, economic issues and foreign policy.''
   Standing on a flatbed truck, a relaxed Bradley addressed a group
of Democrats _ weaving tales about his pro basketball past with a
campaign boost for Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a fellow Democrat.
   The crowd looking up from picnic tables applauded. They laughed
at his jokes. And many walked away wanting to know more about the
6-foot-5 New Jersey senator.
   ``As a speaker, I thought he was really a surprise,'' said
Gloria Sullivan of Des Moines, who anticipated a dry delivery.
   Bradley's appearances in Winterset, Des Moines and Cedar Rapids
were read as testing the waters. But Arthur Davis, chairman of the
Iowa Democratic Party from 1985 to 1987, said the real question is
whether Bradley returns to Iowa after this fall's Nov. 6 election.
   ``If we see him after November, it will be because he's
interested in exploration,'' Davis said.
   Bradley insists he wants to serve another six years in the
Senate.
   ``To anyone who says anything about the presidency, I say, no,
I'm not running for president,'' the two-term incumbent said.
   Given his insistence, Bonnie Campbell, the Democratic candidate
for Iowa attorney general and past state Democratic chairman, said
Bradley's appearance amounts to good strategy.
   ``If you even had anything on your mind down the road, what
would make Democrats think more warmly toward you than helping one
of the most popular senators in Iowa?'' she said.
   Davis cautioned that Iowa might have trouble with a Bradley
candidacy.
   ``Are we going to go East again? Although Iowa did go for
Governor Dukakis, does the salvation of the party lie in Eastern
liberals?''
   Bradley's Iowa visit was one of his few this election season on
behalf of fellow Democrats.
   He spent Friday in Texas with Ann Richards, the Democratic
gubernatorial nominee. He's also helping raise money for Dianne
Feinstein, who is running for governor of California, and Harvey
Gantt, who is running for the Senate from North Carolina.
   Bradley's opponent, Republican Christine Todd Whitman, has
accused him of neglecting New Jersey interests while in Iowa.
   Bradley argued that he was there ``so I can collect my chits''
with Harkin, who as chairman of a Senate appropriations
subcommittee holds the purse strings for several Bradley health and
education bills.

   The Bush administration's decision to add more
F-15 fighters and heavy tanks to Saudi Arabia's defensive shield
against Iraq has an additional benefit, officials say: drawing the
once-resistant Arab nation closer to the West.
   International cooperation in the bid to reverse Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait has opened doors long closed to Washington, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said Tuesday as he returned from a four-day
trip to the Persian Gulf.
   ``I think the degree of cooperation today _ in terms of U.S.
military presence and a collective security effort _ obviously is
far greater than it has ever been before,'' Cheney said.
   Because the threat from Iraq is so serious to the moderate Arab
rulers in the gulf region, Cheney said, ``Nations that previously
have had sort of an arms-length relationship with the U.S. military
are eager to cooperate with and support our efforts in the region,
and the efforts of the other nations involved.''
   The secretary was scheduled to brief Bush on his trip today in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Cheney's high-speed swing through the Persian Gulf was designed
to gain support for the U.S.-led campaign against Iraq. He visited
the Persian Gulf sheikdoms of Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to garner support for Operation Desert
Shield, and also stopped in Egypt.
   With Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and defense minister Prince
Sultan, Cheney discussed the monarchy's hardware wish list to boost
the kingdom's defenses against Iraq's buildup of about 160,000
troops in occupied Kuwait.
   A senior Pentagon official said the administration intends to
move quickly to supply additional F-15 jet fighters and heavy tanks
to the desert kingdom.
   The Saudis want more than the dozen F-15s that President Bush
ordered for an emergency transfer during the early days of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Cheney told reporters that no specific agreements on weapons
sales were reached during talks in Jiddah.
   Although Cheney declined to say exactly what was being
discussed, he stressed that the Saudis need to improve their
defensive hardware quickly. The goal is to keep Saddam Hussein's
army far away from the strategic Saudi oil fields.
   ``We are obviously looking at aircraft, we're looking at
munitions to go with the aircraft, we're looking at things like
protective (anti-chemical weapons) gear, anti-aircraft capabilities
and armor munitions,'' Cheney said. ``They need tanks in order to
be able to defend against Iraqi tanks, so we're improving their
capabilities in that area.''
   The Saudis have purchased U.S.-made F-15Cs and F-15Ds and own 58
of the jets, as well as 550 tanks.
   But across their northern border, Iraq's heavily mechanized
forces possess 5,500 tanks and about 500 combat aircraft.
   The United States has rushed dozens of its most sophisticated
F-15Es, F-16s and F-117A stealth fighter bombers for the operation,
but the Saudis want to improve their own defensive position, the
official said.
   And although the Saudis recently signed a deal to purchase about
$3 billion worth of M1-A2 tanks, the vehicles won't be ready until
the mid-1990s. That makes U.S. stocks of M1-A1 or M-60 tanks
candidates for sale, given that many armored vehicles will be
removed from Europe if a conventional arms accord is reached with
the Warsaw Pact.
   Asked about a report that Cheney was negotiating a deal for a
Saudi purchase of 24 F-15Es, the official said the talks involved
the less sophisticated F-15Cs and F-15Ds, but he also declined to
rule out such a sale. The F-15E has been updated to give it a much
wider range of operation, and it is equipped with Sidewinder and
Sparrow air-to-air missiles.
   Many in Congress would be sure to oppose any sale of the updated
version, given concerns for Israel's security. The Reagan
administration was rebuffed several years ago when it attempted to
sell the Saudis the new model.
   But such sales could help boost a flagging U.S. defense
industry, which is expected to suffer if some of the proposed
Pentagon budget cuts go through.
   Prior to a stop in Cairo, Egypt, to confer with his counterpart
there on Desert Shield, Cheney told reporters he was pleased with
the support he had received during his tour.
   The United Arab Emirates announced it would become the second
nation in the gulf region to host foreign troops. That decision
will help the flow of food, ammunition and supplies to the U.S.
armed forces on land and sea throughout the gulf region.
   ``Various nations are cooperating in various ways. Some are
providing forces, some are providing bases for our forces, some
will help with financial support,'' Cheney said.

<HEAD>Greyhound Drivers, Though Despondent, Stick Out Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the Greyhound strike grinds well into its
sixth month with no resolution in sight, drivers are using odd
jobs, their savings or unemployment checks to scrape by.
   ``The old-timers ... some of them are having a hard time finding
any other work,'' said Darrell Horn, president of a drivers union
local in Portland, Ore. ``They're very despondent. But they're not
going to go back to work under these conditions.''
   The bus line's 6,000 drivers walked out March 2 over a dispute
in wages and job security. Drivers contend they only wanted to
regain ground they lost after taking pay cuts over the past decade
that dropped their salaries from $31,000 to $24,000.
   Now, the bus line, currently under the protection of bankruptcy
court, has told those drivers their jobs no longer exist because it
has resumed ``business as usual'' with 3,000 strikebreakers it
hired.
   ``We still consider Greyhound as our company, the one we built,
the one we gave up our wages for and vacations for, just to keep
the company afloat and give it a chance to breathe,'' Bob Beard, a
Greyhound driver for 29 years, said from his home in suburban
Washington.
   Greyhound contends the union created its own problems with
excessive wage demands. It blames the company's financial trouble
on security and legal costs stemming from initial strike violence
it contends was orchestrated by union leaders.
   Drivers have found a variety of ways to make ends meet. Jim
Gajdos has a job hawking $1 programs at a minor league ballpark in
Boise, Idaho. For Jerry Reidell in Bellingham, Wash., the dispute
has meant switching roles with his wife: He's now at home with
their two children while she works at the Postal Service.
   Other striking drivers have taken temporary and part-time jobs
with tour or charter bus companies. Some have been forced to use
their savings or are trying to survive on unemployment and
$50-a-week strike benefit checks.
   Most drivers enjoyed their jobs, despite the pay cuts, because
of the independence and cross-country trips, strikers said.
   ``People don't really think of us as cowboys, but we're kind of
the stagecoach drivers of the '90s,'' Gajdos said. ``There's a
certain romance to the job.''
   Gajdos and Reidell have both dipped into their savings to help
in the pinch of lost paychecks. Gajdos said that because his
Greyhound pay had dropped over the years, he's used to a life
without the extras.
   ``I guess you could say we've been introduced to poverty on the
installment plan,'' Gajdos said.
   Many local unions have food bank set up where grocers and
charities donate canned goods and cereals for drivers.
   Horn said union drivers are pinning their hopes on some
potential resolutions:
   _A bankruptcy judge might replace Greyhound Chairman Fred G.
Currey with a trustee willing to resume negotiations with union
drivers.
   _A New York investment banking firm, the Blackstone Group, could
take over the company, a move it has been studying. Blackstone has
said a takeover would include bringing union drivers back and
possibly allowing employees to have part ownership.
   _A National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge in
Milwaukee could agree with the board's general counsel and find
that Greyhound engaged in unfair labor practices. That would mean
the bus line would have to take back the union drivers and give
them as much as $10 million a month in back pay. However, Greyhound
has already said it would appeal such a decision, which could mean
court battles for years.
   Greyhound contends its financial problems will be resolved with
a reorganization plan that streamlines the company's operations.
But that reorganization plan isn't due until October, and
extensions on initial plan deadlines frequently are granted.
   Frank Motsay, president of Local 1610 in Washington, said the
drivers' cause has been hurt by a lack of publicity in recent
months, especially since Currey held a news conference May 7 and
said the strike, in effect, was over because replacements had been
hired.
   ``You can't unilaterally declare a strike over when you have
unfair labor practices hanging over your head. Fred Currey is not
going to end this strike by simply wishing it away,'' Motsay said.
   Labor leaders from other unions have privately said the drivers
were ill-prepared for a walkout and should have tried other methods
first to avoid a strike, but many of the striking drivers seem
determined to continue the walkout.

<HEAD>US Force in Saudi Desert Now Tops 35,000, General Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 35,000 U.S. troops are now in Saudi
Arabia or on their way _ and more will be going, says the Air Force
general in charge of getting troops to the desert kingdom.
   The estimate Tuesday by Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, while not
precise, was the clearest official indication of the size of the
U.S. military buildup, which President Bush ordered in response to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait three weeks ago.
   Johnson, commander of the U.S. Transportation Command and
Military Airlift Command, told reporters that the equivalent of 1
billion pounds of military equipment and soldiers had been shipped
from U.S. shores to the Saudi desert.
   He said that was comparable to ferrying 400,000 U.S. automobiles
over that distance.
   Johnson said military security rules prevented him from
disclosing the exact number of soldiers or amount of equipment that
have been sent to Saudi Arabia, but he said, ``We've moved in
essence'' the equivalent of a town the size of Jefferson City, Mo.
   The population of Jefferson City is 35,408, according to the
preliminary 1990 census.
   ``We've also moved all of their equipment, cars, trucks,
foodstuffs, stocks, household goods and water supply,'' Johnson
said.
   In addition to the U.S. ground forces in Saudi Arabia, an
estimated 20,000 sailors are deployed on warships in the Persian
Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean as part of
Operation Desert Shield to defend against a possible Iraqi attack.
   Johnson said he could not discuss planned additional
deployments, but Pentagon sources have said contingency plans call
for sending as many as 250,000 troops, depending on Iraqi military
moves.
   An administration source gave a different figure Tuesday, saying
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, planned to tell Bush today that the
United States was approaching a target figure of 100,000 military
personnel in the region.
   The transportation strain has fallen most heavily on the
Pentagon's airlift operation, Johnson said, because of the need in
the earliest stage of Desert Shield to get as many light infantry
on the ground in Saudi Arabia as possible.
   He described the air operation as ``the largest sustained
airlift ever over a short period of time.''
   Besides the workhorse C-141 and C-5 military transport planes
used to ferry men and equipment, Johnson said the Pentagon has
relied heavily on the commercial airline industry. Several airlines
volunteered to provide charter passenger service, he said, but late
last week the Pentagon decided to commandeer 38 civilian cargo and
passenger jets because the volunteer pool was too small.
   Johnson said he didn't expect to force additional commercial
planes into service.
   Johnson also acknowledged that the urgent nature of the
deployments was forcing the Pentagon to put off certain safety
inspections of the C-141 fleet, which has been plagued by
structural cracks in some planes.
   ``We're taking some risk'' by pressing the full fleet into
service before completing the safety review, he said.
   The general said the overall air and sea transportation effort
had gone well, aided in part by more than 4,200 military reservists
who had volunteered to come on active duty.
   Johnson told of one man who called to volunteer for duty aboard
a merchant ship for the 10,000 mile trip to Saudi Arabia, but that
he was a little concerned about his insurance ``and a few other
little details.'' The man was 81 years old.
   ``We didn't call on him this time, but he was ready to go,''
Johnson said.
   The latest additions to the U.S. military operation in Saudi
Arabia include:
   _An undetermined number of soldiers from the 24th Infantry
Division, a mechanized unit based at Fort Stewart, Ga., left from
Hunter Army Airfield near Savannah on Tuesday.
   _The tank landing ship USS Manitowac and the amphibious assault
ship USS Iwo Jima left port at Norfolk, Va., to pick up Marines at
Moorehead City, N.C., for the week-long voyage to the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Food Stamp Rise Shows Extent of Poverty, Congressman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The sharp rise in food stamp recipients shows
how prevalent poverty is in America, a congressional committee on
hunger says.
   ``At some time everyone is going to have to come to grips with
the fact that we have this many poor people,'' said Rep. Tony Hall,
D-Ohio, in a statement released Tuesday by his House Select
Committee on Hunger.
   The statement followed published reports about an Agriculture
Department study that showed the number of people on food stamps
rose 1 million between May 1989 and May 1990 to top 20 million for
the first time in five years.
   The Agriculture Department report had been requested by the
Senate Appropriations Committee, which is still considering how
much to allow for the food stamp program next year. The House has
approved $18.1 billion. Congress appropriated $16 billion for this
year's program.
   ``What is remarkable about the recent growth in participation is
that there is no consensus about its causes,'' said the Agriculture
Department, which released a summary of the report this week. ``It
occurred even though there were no major changes in the food stamp
program or in the economy, at least as measured by the national
unemployment rate.''
   Hall said, however, that the findings in the report demonstrate
how even a slight downturn in the economy can be too much for some
people, throwing them onto public assistance rolls.
   The rise extended to 44 states and the District of Columbia,
varying in size and timing from state to state. Nearly half the
total increase was attributable to a rise in recipients in Texas,
California and Florida, the report said.
   The Agriculture Department investigators said the increases are
so recent that much of the data traditionally used to analyze food
stamp trends are not available.
   However, the study offers several possible reasons for the
increases:
   _Greater long-term unemployment that's not showing up in
statistics.
   _More working poor.
   _Higher food prices.
   _Changes in the distribution of income.
   _More female heads of household.
   _Changes in the immigration laws giving thousands of aliens
legal status and making them eligible for food stamps.
   _Improved accessibility and outreach.
   The 1990 farm bill approved by the House earlier this month
would make even more people eligible than current law, with
provisions designed to help children, the near-homeless and
homeless, the elderly, disabled and rural Americans who
traditionally have not had as much access to the food assistance
program.

   A prominent medical journal broke the rules of
scientific impartiality by printing an article assuring the safety
of a synthetic hormone that boosts cow milk production, says the
head of a foundation that is critical of genetic engineering.
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends,
says today's article in the Journal of the American Medical
Association was written by two scientists who have worked for a
leading maker of bovine growth hormone.
   ``The editors of JAMA are showing a flagrant disregard for
scientific impartiality by publishing an article written by
scientists who have been under contract to Monsanto,'' Rifkin said
Tuesday.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, and
the inspector general's office of the Department of Health and
Human Services are reviewing the Food and Drug Administration's
handling of the hormone.
   The JAMA article says FDA ``uses a systematic, scientific
process to ensure that all new products used by dairy farmers are
safe'' and has answered all the concerns about the safety of milk
from cows that have received the hormone.
   The authors, William Daughaday and David Barbano, noted that the
FDA pronounced the hormone safe in 1985, and could approve its
commercial use by next year.
   But Rifkin said: ``Protection of the public interests demands
independent, long-term studies to determine the safety of milk from
cows that have been injected.''
   ``BGH has been overwhelmingly rejected by both farmers and
consumers recent public opinion surveys,'' said Rifkin. ``The
introduction of BDH would devastate the family farm, undermine the
purity of dairy products, add billions of dollars to the cost of
dairy support programs, hurt cows and pose potential health
problems.''
   Wisconsin and Minnesota have temporarily barred use of the
hormone.
   However, an editorial in JAMA by an outside researcher concurred
with Daughaday and Barbano, saying ``milk produced from cows
treated with bovine somatotropin is no different from the milk of
untreated cows.''
   ``It is both inappropriate and wrong for special-interest groups
to play on the health and safety fears of the public to further
their own ends,'' said the editorial, by Charles H. Grossman, an
immunologist at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Cincinnati.

   Health services and educational programs for
rural Americans at high risk of getting AIDS must be expanded
dramatically to stem the spread of the disease, the National
Commission on AIDS says.
   ``AIDS education is virtually non-existent and desperately
needed in rural communities,'' the commission said in a report to
the White House and congressional leaders Tuesday.
   This absence of information about AIDS has fanned ``an epidemic
of fear and bigotry'' in rural America, where people infected with
the AIDS virus fear being ``found out'' nearly as much as they fear
the disease itself, the panel said.
   Physicians and other health-care professionals across the
country also must be educated about acquired immune deficiency
syndrome because too many of them are refusing to treat AIDS
patients, the commission's report said.
   Another area of concern to the commission was access to
experimental drugs, which panel members said is extremely limited
for minorities, women and children, even those who have no other
hope.
   The 15-member commission that advises Congress and the White
House urged swift action on its latest recommendations, as it did
for its recommendations in two previous reports.
   ``We're very late in responding to a massive problem, but
getting later makes no sense at all,'' said Dr. June Osborn,
commission chairwoman and dean of the University of Michigan School
of Public Health.
   The 13-page report drew from the commission's visits to Georgia
and Texas. Panel members heard from people who had been rejected by
their church, lost their jobs and were evicted from their
apartments because they were infected with HIV, the human
immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.
   ``Ignorance and misinformation are seriously hampering, if not
crippling efforts to treat'' rural Americans with HIV infection and
AIDS, the report said.
   AIDS is a more severe problem in the cities, but the epidemic is
growing faster in rural areas. Cases of the disease rose 37 percent
in rural areas compared with 5 percent in metropolitan areas with
more than half a million people from 1988 to 1989, the report said.
   The commission recognized recent federal efforts to include more
blacks and Hispanics in government-funded testing of experimental
drugs, but said: ``We can and must do better.''
   Blacks and Hispanics account for 43 percent of all AIDS cases,
but they make up only 23 percent of clinical trial participants,
the report said.
   Children and women of childbearing age usually have been
excluded from clinical trials, but the panel said that must change.
   The report also said the National Institutes of Health had moved
too slowly to find drugs to manage opportunistic infections, which
are the cause of death for most AIDS patients. The panel said NIH
should give that research a higher priority while continuing work
on drugs that act on the AIDS virus.
   Turning to health-care personnel, the commission said it ``heard
repeatedly about a serious shortage of dentists willing to treat
people with HIV infection and AIDS.''
   The report related the experiences of one witness who said the
only two dentists in his community who would accept Medicaid
declined to see him because he was infected with HIV.
   ``One dentist's excuse was that his office was carpeted and he
would not be able to sterilize the room after the visit. The other
dentist said she had plants and could not take the risk of him
infecting her plants and her plants then infecting her other
patients,'' the report said.
   The commission also recommended creation of ``a comprehensive
community-based primary health care system, supported by adequate
funding and reimbursement rates.'' Such a system ``is essential for
the care and treatment of all people,'' not just those with AIDS,
the panel said.
   However, the panel did not outline the specifics of such a
system.

   In Texas, near Fort Hood, the waiting period
for marriage licenses is waived to accommodate soldiers shipping
out to the Middle East.
   A Florida manufacturer of sunblock cream offers to make an
unscented batch because, ``I'd hate to see 5,000 of our guys
advancing across the desert toward the enemy smelling like a
coconut.''
   Perhaps influenced by the movie ``Dirty Dozen,'' 14 inmates at
Cross City Correctional Institution in North Florida announce they
want to fight in Saudi Arabia, redeem their honor, and gain their
freedom.
   In thousands of ways, America prepares for war.
   ``We are not just seeking release from prison,'' the inmates
said in a letter. ``We are willing to defend this country and in
the process, restore some of the lost honor we have inflicted on
ourselves and this country.''
   The noble sentiments were lost on Bob Macmaster, a spokesman for
the Florida Department of Correction. He suggested the prisoners
have been watching too many movies.
   Around the country, the Middle East confrontation brings these
changes:
   _New Mexico state police were urged by their chief, Neil Curran,
to pump their own gas to save money and to shop for the lowest
price.
   _Bookseller Diana King in Mountain Brook, Ala., found a run on
atlases because ``people want to know where it all is.''
   _In Texas, there were runaway sales of camouflage-colored muscle
shirts. In Georgia, a business handed out little American flags to
wave proudly from car antennas.
   _Sharon Wagner of El Paso, Texas, who owns a computer portrait
business, told The Associated Press she wants to print Saddam
Hussein's likeness on T-shirts with a bull's eye on his chest.
   Along Interstate 75, gray-green trucks took the 101st Airborne
from Fort Campbell, Ky., to Florida ships bound for the Middle
East. People stood on overpasses in north Georgia to cheer the
troops on their way. One banner read: ``Get Their Gas and Kick
Their Ass.''
   Don Gage of Dalton, Ga., supplied a flag, 30 feet by 50 feet.
   ``Gosh,'' he said, ``we had to do something. We want them to
know we care. And I'll tell you this: We can't wait to put it on
the northbound side to welcome them back.''
   In Johannesburg, Mich., Mary Wolf raised a flag outside her home
and said, ``I'm hoping it spreads like wildfire across the United
States ... Let the hostages know we're caring.''
   Bell County, Texas, waived the 24-hour waiting period for
marriages of Fort Hood soldiers and issued a record 160 licenses
last week.
   A New York City comedy club featured seven comedians with the
central theme ``Iraq-Nophobia.''
   Everywhere that soldiers leave for the oven-baked Middle East,
there is a rush to buy sunblock cream. Paul E. Burke Sr., president
of Native Tan Inc., in Daytona Beach, Fla., offered to supply
odorless sunblock at cost.
   Eileen Bronko of Naugatuck, Conn., sister of a Saudi-based
soldier, led a contingent of 50 people to tie a ribbon around the
town flag pole. She wants Americans to decorate trees with
red-white-and-blue ribbons to show they care about the troops and
not just about oil prices.
   Fabric stores in Enterprise, Ala., and Dothan, Ala., have given
away thousands of yards of yellow ribbon since troops from nearby
Fort Rucker shipped out last week.
   Dean Richards, program director for the nationwide Satellite
Music Network, got a call from a frightened girl he estimated to be
8 to 10 years old. She asked that he play `Right Here Waiting for
You' by Richard Marx.
   The youngster said ``her daddy was in the Marines and she was
right here waiting for him to come back,'' said Richards.
   Richards devoted air time all last weekend to 500 messages to
GIs along with playing musical requests. The network contacted the
Armed Forces Radio network and arranged for a tape of the show to
be replayed for troops in the Middle East. It will happen again
next weekend.
   K-Mart manager Wesley Bennefield _ whose store in Hinesville,
Ga., sold 24,000 items of bug spray, suntan lotion, skin lotion,
lip balm and foot power to the Army at Fort Stewart last week _
said the service got a discount.
   ``You might say we're waving the flag,'' said Bennefield. ``I'm
a patriotic guy.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly three weeks after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait, the first signs are showing of a gathering economic
crisis in the developing world.
   In Nepal, there's a run on gasoline, and gas prices have
increased 50 percent in Zambia. Sri Lanka is worried about access
to the Persian Gulf states who are major purchases of tea, its
principal foreign exchange earner.
   Scores of oil-poor and cash-strapped nations face inflation,
slower growth and increased debt after Iraq invaded Kuwait, causing
crude prices to rise from about $20 a barrel to more than $25.
   The worst hit are the smaller and poorer nations of the world,
for whom increasing oil prices and U.N. sanctions on trade with
Iraq and Kuwait will drastically disrupt their already tenuous
balance of payments.
   Manpower-exporting countries ranging from the Philippines to
Egypt risk suffering rising unemployment and declining foreign
exchange _ gained by workers' sending part of their paychecks home
_ if their citizens lose jobs in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``We could have an economic crisis of calamitous proportions _
especially if a shooting war starts in the gulf,'' says I.Z.
Bhatty, a member of an economic think tank in New Delhi. ``Oil is a
product which has the most linkages with the rest of the economy.''
   Many of these nations have little or no capacity for refining
crude oil, so they were ready buyers of petroleum products from
Kuwait, which had the most advanced refineries in the gulf.
   The pinch is also being felt in Eastern Europe, where several
countries have given Iraq large export credits and have little hope
of cashing in on the debt.
   Here are some of the countries affected and how they're trying
to cope:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BANGLADESH _ The government has announced restrictions on fuel
consumption and shops have been ordered to close by 8 p.m. to
conserve electricity.
   Bangladesh receives at least $100 million annally from citizens
working in Iraq and Kuwait, about 12 percent of its total
remittances. The country would face enormous unemployment if these
110,000 people return home.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BULGARIA _ President Zhelyu Zhelev says Iraq owes his nation
$1.2 billion that it was repaying in oil shipments. Also, Bulgaria
will lose $160 million in incomplete exports to Iraq. Zhelev has
declared a moratorium on Bulgaria's $10.3 billion debt.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EGYPT _ About 54,000 Egyptians working in Iraq and Kuwait have
returned home. At least 1.2 million Egyptians were working in the
two countries before the crisis began, and they contributed a large
chunk of the $3.5 billion of foreign remittances every year. Trade
with Iraq, which stood at $74 million last year, is frozen.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   INDIA _ India was already affected by a resource crunch and
depleted foreign exchange reserves when the gulf crisis hit. The
government estimates its oil bill will rise by $850 million in
1990, and at least 170,000 of its citizens in Iraq and Kuwait will
stop sending remittances home.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LEBANON _ Fuel prices have quadrupled and food prices have
doubled since Iraq's invasion. The Lebanese pound has plummeted to
an all-time low of 850 to the dollar. Kuwait was at the forefront
of a $2 billion reconstruction plan in Lebanon, which has been
devastated by 15 years of civil war.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PAKISTAN _ Remittances from 180,000 Pakistanis in Iraq and
Kuwait have dried up.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PHILIPPINES _ Devastated by an earthquake last month, the
Philippines faces the return of 93,000 of its citizens working in
Iraq and Kuwait. The two countries also supplied 22.5 percent of
the Philippines' fuel needs.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ROMANIA _ Iraq owes Romania $1.7 billion in export credit.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SRI LANKA _ The government has said it will not stop trade with
Iraq. ``Sanctions can be imposed by rich countries. We cannot
afford to stop selling our products,'' says Deputy Defense Minister
Ranjan Wijeratne.
   Sri Lanka sells tea worth $100 million to Iraq every year and
receives about $500,000 from its citizens working in the gulf,
according to government figures. Gasoline and cooking prices have
been raised.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   YUGOSLAVIA _ Construction companies were involved in projects
worth $1 billion in Iraq. Also, Baghdad owes Yugoslavia $1.1
billion and was repaying with supplies of crude oil.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ZAMBIA _ Zambia has announced a 50 percent increase in fuel and
kerosene because of the gulf crisis.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ZIMBABWE _ Zimbabwe imported two-thirds of its fuel needs from
Kuwait, about $120 million annually. The government says it has a
two-month supply in reserve and that Saudi Arabia has promised to
make up the shortfall.

   Figures for July show the government heading
toward a possible new record deficit.
   The $189.1 billion deficit so far during the first 10 months of
fiscal 1990 already surpassed the entire $152.1 billion imbalance
piled up during the previous year, the Treasury Department said
Tuesday.
   And it has only $32 billion to go in the next two months to beat
the $221.1 billion record set in 1986. It is already 52.9 percent
above the $123.7 billion deficit compiled at the end of the first
10 months of 1989.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget in July forecast
a $218.5 billion deficit when the current fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
   Louis Crandall, an economist with R.H. Wrightson &amp; Associates in
New York, said that ``much of the concern over the deficit trend
this year has been because of weakness in receipts.''
   However, he noted that revenues in July totaled $72.4 billion,
up 9.3 percent from the comparable month last year and said, ``That
doesn't seem to be getting worse.''
   Nevertheless, while individual tax revenues rose, corporate tax
revenues dropped, illustrating the weak economy.
   And the overall receipts were more than offset by spending which
rose 16.4 percent to $98.3 billion.
   The outlays included $3.2 billion by the Resolution Trust Corp.,
the government agency charged with bailing out the savings and loan
industry. The S&amp;L bailout cost $15.8 billion in June and $35.2
billion so far this year.
   The government expects to regain much of the bailout cost by
selling real estate, loans, securities and other assets from failed
thrifts. That, the government says, will help reduce the deficit in
future years.
   In addition to spending on the thrift bailout, economist
Crandall noted other ``very strong spending in many categories,
particularly Medicare and Medicaid.''
   Spending by the Health Finance Administration, which administers
both programs, was 25 percent higher in July than a year ago,
Crandall said.
   Revenues for the first 10 months of fiscal 1990 totaled $850.1
billion, up 4.3 percent from the same period of 1989. But spending
totaled $1.04 trillion, a 10.7 percent increase over the first 10
months of last year.
   The biggest spending categories, as usual, were the military,
Social Security and other programs of the Department of Health and
Human Services, and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $22 billion in July and $241.4 so far
this year. It is projected to total $290.2 billion for the entire
fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $19.6 billion for the month
and $203.1 billion for the year so far. They are projected to total
$244.9 billion for the year.
   Other HHS payments, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$17.3 billion during July and $161.4 billion thus far this year.
They are projected to total $192.4 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $18.4 billion for the
month and $228.6 billion so far this year. It is projected to total
$261.1 billion for the entire year.

<HEAD>Jackson Tries to Visit Iraq as a Journalist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says he wants to go to Iraq as a
journalist rather than diplomat but still thinks he can help ease
tensions by interviewing officials and Americans held hostage in
that country.
   ``It would not be appropriate to go there as a diplomat,'' the
former Democratic presidential contender turned television-show
host told reporters Tuesday. Assuming such a role ``would interfere
with what is a growing crisis,'' he said.
   But Jackson, who traveled to Syria in 1984 to negotiate the
release of a Navy pilot shot down over Syria, said journalistic
communications could encourage a diplomatic solution to the Middle
East crisis.
   ``We are not certain just yet as to what our government's plans
are for that area,'' Jackson said. ``If on the one hand it is
military deterrence and diplomatic initiatives, then communications
could facilitate a level of dialogue that appears to be closing.''
   ``The Jesse Jackson Show'' is scheduled to begin next month,
syndicated by Time-Warner Inc., which Jackson said would help
underwrite the trip. The staff of the new show is trying to make
arrangements for the trip, he said.
   But he added in an interview later with WTTG-TV that ``pressure
has been applied (by the administration to discourage the trip) and
it's unfortunate and it is inconsistent.''
   The White House and the State Department denied any effort to
discourage Jackson from traveling.

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is still in Maine at
the midpoint of his 25-day holiday, mixing golf with the gulf in a
vacation marred by the biggest U.S. military operation since the
Vietnam war.
   ``What you don't want to do is appear to be held hostage in the
White House to events,'' Bush told reporters as he headed off to
his summer home 12 days ago.
   But it appears there's a price to be paid for not being a
hostage, too.
   At a time when young soldiers are sweltering in newly dug
foxholes in the Saudi desert, gas masks attached to their garrison
belts, the president has been pictured almost daily out golfing at
breakneck pace or chasing bluefish in the Atlantic in his beloved
cigarette boat, Fidelity.
   Polls show the public overwhelmingly backs Bush's stand in
defense of Saudi Arabia and, by lesser margins, the public supports
his taking a vacation too.
   But Bush may be laying himself open to partisan attack at a
later date with the maladroit way the White House has projected his
image on several occasions in the past two weeks.
   As Democratic political consultant Bob Squier put it, ``If I
ever need it, I now have a shot of Bush climbing into a hot boat
and wasting gas on the day he sent American boys to risk their
lives for more wasted gas.''
   The crisis has clearly made heavy demands upon the president's
time at Walker's Point, the scenic family refuge on Maine's rocky
coast.
   Twice he has jetted back to Washington. He has delivered
speeches at the Pentagon and before the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
He opened his door to Jordan's King Hussein and Saudi Arabia's
Prince Saud. And he has kept the phone lines ringing at other
capitals.
   Republican pollster and White House adviser Robert Teeter said a
poll that he and Democrat Peter Hart conducted for the Wall Street
Journal and NBC found the public supporting Bush's decision to stay
on vacation by a 53 percent to 39 percent margin. The same survey
found overwhelming support for Bush's handling of the gulf crisis:
72 to 16 percent.
   Teeter, in an interview from Ann Arbor, Mich., called the
questions raised about Bush's staying in Kennebunkport, ``purely a
story created by the press.''
   ``Ultimately, what counts is how he handles (the crisis) and
what the results are. This we will all forget,'' said Teeter.
   Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution says the media are
giving a false impression of how the presidency works.
   ``It's a question of image versus reality,'' said Hess, a White
House adviser in past administrations. ``The reality is the
presidency goes where the president is. ... Logistically, they are
perfectly supplied wherever they are. And Kennebunkport is not
exactly Nome, Alaska.''
   Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, said, ``I do not think it's a bad idea to send
indirectly to Saddam Hussein the message that if we're in a long
war of nerves, Bush is not panicking. He's going about business as
usual.''
   And Bush may be better off facing this crisis in the
``psychologically mellow'' surroundings of his summer home with
wife and family rather than back in the white House ``grumbling and
puttering around alone,'' Ornstein said.
   But Ornstein said he is puzzled by the ``political
tone-deafness'' of Bush's sojourn in Kennebunkport.
   ``Every day there are pictures and sound bites of him responding
to events in the gulf, all showing him on the golf course, getting
out of the boat, jogging, and I don't think that's a particularly
good image for him to be putting out,'' he said.
   It may not matter much at a time when Americans ``have rallied
around our commander in chief and rallied around the flag,'' said
Ornstein. ``But if something goes wrong ... his recreating is going
to be a major piece of the attack against him.''

   Other HHS payments, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$17.3 billion during July and $161.4 billion thus far this year.
They are projected to total $192.4 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $18.4 billion for the

$261.1 billion for the entire year.

<TEXT>
   Police have arrested about
40 Indians blocking a rail line, but another group of natives set
up another blockade within hours further down the tracks.
   The premier of this Canadian province, Bill Vander Zalm,
condemned the second blockade Tuesday, called because of a dispute
over land claims.
   ``I would suggest they are doing harm and they should cease,
desist and avoid the sort of confrontational issues this could lead
to,'' he said.
   Earlier Tuesday, police arrested about 40 Indians at Seton
Portage for defying a provincial Supreme Court injunction ordering
them to end their blockade of British Columbia Rail's main line.
   Those arrested included three chiefs _ Marvin Bob of the
Pavilion band, Rod Louie of Seton Lake and Roger Adolph of the
Fountain band _ all part of the Stl'atl'imx nation. The
Stl'atl'imx, unhappy with British Columbia's response to their land
claims proposals, had asked the police inspector to charge the
provincial government with the theft of their land.
   Those arrested at Seton Portage were taken to Lillooet, about
100 miles northeast of Vancouver. They were to be released on their
own recognizance after being charged with disobeying a court order,
authorities said.
   When the first blockade was removed, two freight trains bound
for Prince George continued a journey stalled since Friday, when
the blockade began.
   But before a southbound train had gone far, Indians from the
Lillooet People's Movement blocked the line on Indian land near
Mount Currie, about 60 miles southwest of Seton Portage, said Ray
Pierre, manager of the Mount Currie Indian band.
   Pierre said the line will be blocked for at least 24 hours.
   The BC Rail line runs between Vancouver and Prince George. The
railroad said it was losing more than $635,000 a day because of the
blockade. BC Rail obtained the Supreme Court injunction Saturday.
   The blockade also was in support Mohawks in Oka, Quebec, who
have been in an armed standoff with police and the armed forces
since July 11.
   The dispute arose over the Oka community's plans to expand a
golf course onto what the Mohawks said was ancestral land. A police
attempt to remove a Mohawk barricade led to the shooting death of
an officer, but responsibility in the death remains to be
established.
   Karistanoran, a Mohawk spokesman, said proposals now call for
full sovereignty in all Mohawk communities in Canada.

   The rancher daughter of a former Wyoming
governor won the GOP nomination for her father's old job Tuesday
and will square off in November against Democratic Gov. Mike
Sullivan, who coasted to victory.
   Republican Sen. Alan Simpson handily won his primary race for
re-election.
   With 69 percent of the vote in, rancher Mary Mead had 67 percent
of the vote to 33 percent for 12-year state Rep. Nyla Murphy.
   ``We're not celebrating yet, but we are looking foward to doing
it,'' Mead said from her Jackson ranch. ``We have lots of friends
here at my house. ... A friend sent a case of champaign and I hope
to break it out and toast victory.''
   Mead, 55, is seeking to give Wyoming its first father-daughter
combination in the governor's mansion. Her father, Cliff Hansen,
served one term as governor from 1963 to 1967 before moving on to
the U.S. Senate.
   Sullivan walked away with the Democratic nomination, receiving
88 percent of the early vote against motorcycle mechanic Ron
``Suds'' Clingman, who had called for lowering the drinking age to
18 and decriminalizing drugs.
   Simpson, the Senate minority whip, headed easily to his third
GOP nomination with 85 percent of the vote and will meet
little-known Democrat Kathy Helling, a 32-year-old college student.
With 69 percent of the vote in, she received 35 percent to 22
percent for Howard O'Connor, her closest rival in a six-way race.
   The first-term governor said he would have preferred to face
stiffer competition.
   ``I have to say that when you watch people debating the issues
on the other side, you wish you had some primary opposition so you
could talk about the issues,'' said Sullivan.
   Mead's campaign stressed her skills as a rancher and
businesswoman and attacked Sullivan's economic development efforts.
   Murphy, in turn, accused Mead of having a negative attitude
toward Wyoming and of failing to propose solutions to the
shortfalls she perceived.
   Sullivan largely ignored the primary campaign and stuck close to
his gubernatorial duties.
   Rep. Craig Thomas had no opposition in the primary. Elected last
year to fill Dick Cheney's unexpired term, Thomas is seeking his
first full term in the House. Also unopposed was his Democratic
challenger, Pete Maxfield, a University of Wyoming law professor.

   John M. Stalnaker, a psychologist who
founded and was president of the National Merit Scholarship Corp.,
has died at age 87.
   Stalnaker, who died at his home Sunday of lymphatic cancer,
taught psychology, developed tests and handled administrative
duties at the Universities of Chicago and Minnesota and Purdue,
Princeton and Stanford.
   At Princeton, Stalnaker originated and operated the National
Pepsi-Cola Scholarship Program, forerunner of the National Merit
Scholarship. He helped develop that project as a consultant to the
Ford Foundation.
   Today, the non-profit organization channels scholarship money
from 425 corporations and foundations and 200 colleges and
universities to more than 30,000 students. Eight thousand high
school students are selected each year for the program.
   After the Merit Program was established as an independent
corporation in 1955, he was named its first president, a position
he held until his retirement in 1969.
   He also was associate director of the College Entrance
Examination Board from 1936 to 1945.
   During World War II, Stalnaker directed the Army-Navy College
Qualifying Test and other examinations. President Lyndon Johnson
appointed him to the Board of Foreign Scholarships, which he served
as chairman from 1962 to 1965.
   In 1964, he became the first director of Presidential
Scholarship Program.
   Survivors include his wife, Edna, a daughter, two sons and a
sister.
   Funeral services will be private.

   A bomb shattered windows at a
McDonalds restaurant before dawn today, one of three bombings that
rocked the capital, police said. No one was injured in the attacks
authorities blamed on rightists.
   At around 1 a.m. a man hurled a plastic bag that exploded,
destroying doors and windows of the McDonalds, another hamburger
stand and a passing taxi, police said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the latest
attacks. Lt. Col. Pablo Bernabe, police chief of suburban
Valenzuela, blamed rebel soldiers for the bombings.
   ``We are inclined to believe that this was the handiwork of
ultrarightists who are sowing fear among our people to destabilize
our democratic government,'' Bernabe said.
   The McDonalds bombing was the latest attack since dissident
right-wing soldiers bombed buildings of the Department of Trade and
Industry on Aug. 13, and the third since late Tuesday.
   A bomb shattered glass windows of a private investment building
in the Binondo district Tuesday night. This was followed about
three hours later by a blast near a fire station in Valenzuela that
shattered windows of nearby houses and the fire station. No one was
injured.
   Rumors of another coup attempt swept the capital following the
bombings and the military has been place on full alert since Friday.
   President Corazon Aquino on Tuesday said ``enemies of
democracy'' continue to plot against her government, which has
survived six coup attempts by dissident troops since its formation
in February 1985.
   ``These people will never succeed as long as we have trust in
each other, especially if we have trust in God,'' she told 5,000
people who attended a Mass to commemorate the assassination of her
husband, former Sen. Benigno Aquino, seven years ago.
   The bloodiest coup attempt occurred in December, in which at
least 113 people died and 600 were wounded.

<HEAD>Astronomers Help Keep Abe's Reputation Honest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two astronomers say they have discovered
evidence that may keep Abraham Lincoln's reputation as ``Honest
Abe'' intact.
   They say Lincoln, as a lawyer before he became president, played
fair 133 years ago when he got a murder suspect off the hook by
discrediting a witness who said he saw the crime by the light of a
bright, three-quarters-full moon.
   Lincoln produced an almanac that indicated the moon was setting
and near the horizon at 11 p.m. on Aug. 29, 1857, when Duff
Armstrong supposedly bludgeoned a man to death after a religious
camp meeting in Illinois. Armstrong was acquitted.
   But townspeople remembered there was indeed a full, bright moon
at the camp meeting that night. Some suspected Lincoln of producing
a phony almanac.
   Now it appears that both Lincoln and the townspeople's memories
were correct, said astronomers Donald Olson and Russell Doescher of
Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos.
   Using computers to recreate the sky above central Illinois on
the night of the murder, the astronomers found that what occurred
was an unusual lunar phenomenon that caused the moon to move
quickly from its highest point in the sky to setting.
   The moon on that night was 74 percent full and near a position
it reaches only once every 18.6 years, in which its arc is at its
lowest in the sky as seen by people in the northern hemisphere.
   The astronomers' calculate that just before 8 p.m., during the
camp meeting, the moon was due south and at its highest point for
the night. But by 11 p.m., the moon was already dropping from view
near the southwestern horizon.
   Coincidentally, there will be a somewhat similar event on this
year's anniversary of the slaying. Olson said the moon will be
about three-quarters full and low in the sky, although not in as
extreme a southern declination as it was the last time the
18.6-year cycle came around, in early 1987.
   Olson said it took about six months of research and combing
through libraries in five states to collect the data needed to
re-create the sky.
   ``This is really fun to blend astronomy with something else,''
he said. ``We've made a small contribution to this episode. The
books (on Lincoln) are a little bit confusing on this.''
   He got the idea to investigate the ``almanac trial'' mystery
when he saw a photograph last year of Norman Rockwell's painting of
Lincoln in court.
   ``Being an astronomer this interested me,'' he said. ``I
thought, what the heck is he doing with that almanac?''

<TEXT>
   A fourth round of talks to end El
Salvador's bloody civil war has deadlocked with a new wave of
leftist guerrilla attacks on government troops.
   Both sides said they were pessimistic about reaching any
agreement before five days of talks were scheduled to wrap up
today. The government rejects rebel demands to dismantle the army
and punish officers for alleged human rights abuses during a
10-year-old war that has killed 73,000 people.
   ``Tomorrow, the meeting will end and there will be no agreement
on the issue of the armed forces,'' rebel negotiator Salvador
Samayoa told a news conference late Tuesday.
   Samayoa accused President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist
government of failing ``to make any move whatever'' to get closer
to the rebel position demanding that both the army and the
guerrillas be dismantled.
   ``It could be said that we are stuck,'' Justice Minister Oscar
Santamaria, who heads the U.S.-backed government's negotiating
team, said even before Tuesday's session began.
   He criticized the rebels for the attacks Monday and Tuesday that
killed 11 people and wounded 12. A San Salvador army barracks
across the street from Cristiani's residence was among the targets.
   The State Department said rebel violence during the talks raised
doubts about the rebels' willingness to negotiate.
   ``The guerrillas should immediately cease these attacks and
negotiate seriously to end the war,'' said the department's deputy
spokesman, Richard Boucher said Tuesday in Washington.
   Mediator Alvaro de Soto, a personal representative of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said it also was
unlikely that agreement could be reached on a cease-fire Sept. 15,
as originally planned.
   He said the negotiations will continue as scheduled every month,
but added that ``given the dynamics of the ... process, it's
impossible to arrive at a negotiated cease-fire agreement before
Sept. 15.''
   Representatives for the two sides had set the Sept. 15 deadline
for a cease-fire at their first round of talks earlier this year,
and both had expressed optimism this could be done when the round
opened Friday.
   Cristiani has said the size of the army was open to discussion
and talking about a purge of officers responsible for human rights
abuses should come after a cease-fire. But he says abolishing the
army was out of the question because it is unconstitutional.
   More than 73,000 people have been killed in the civil war, most
of them civilians.

<HEAD>Havel Addresses Crowd of 100,000 on Invasion Anniversary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel, marking
the first free commemoration of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion, told
100,000 Czechoslovaks that they must finish toppling the
``burdensome heritage'' of Communist rule.
   The huge crowd on Tuesday overflowed Wenceslas Square in
downtown Prague, the site of confrontations 22 years ago between
Soviet tanks and weeping, angry Czechoslovaks who pelted them with
rocks and garbage.
   The Aug. 21, 1968 military intervention crushed the Prague
Spring reform movement that tried to introduce Communism with a
human face.
   Havel, the dissident playwright catapulted to the presidency by
November's peaceful democratic upheaval, cautioned the crowd that
reform remains unfinished.
   ``It is the burdensome heritage of the totalitarian system that
we haven't yet come to grips with,'' he said. ``In many communities
huge bureaucratic monsters continue to rule.''
   But Soviet tanks no longer back them, he said, adding:
   ``We will have only ourselves to blame if we allow them to
overpower us. It is necessary for all the people to put their noses
to the grindstone. We've lost 20 years, and we cannot afford to
lose another single day.''
   Havel's comments concentrated on the future, blasting what he
called the Communist legacy: inefficiency, corruption and
dilettantism that he said threatened Czechoslovakia's budding
democracy.
   Tuesday's observances marked the first free commemoration of the
invasion anniversary.
   Last year, before Czechoslovakia's hard-line Communist leaders
were ousted, riot police waded into thousands of people who
gathered in Wenceslas Square to remember the Soviet-led invasion
and to demand reform.
   The official CTK news agency estimated the crowd filling
Wenceslas Square on Tuesday at 100,000.
   It was believed to be the largest gathering there since
November's revolution when hundreds of thousands of Czechoslovaks
crowded the square repeatedly to press their demands for
democratization.
   Those demonstrations culminated in the toppling of Communist
rule and led to democratic elections in June in which Havel's Czech
Civic Forum political movement and its Slovak counterpart, Public
Against Violence, won a parliamentary majority.
   Alexander Dubcek, the reformist Communist Party leader who
spearheaded the Prague Spring movement, also addressed the crowd.
   Dubcek, who emerged from years in oblivion to become speaker of
the freely elected Parliament, was greeted with chants of ``Long
Live Dubcek!'' as he spoke.
   Bulgaria's premier, Andrei Lukanov, told state TV: ``As a nation
and as a party we must be ashamed of ourselves for taking part in
the events in Czechoslovakia in 1968.''
   The Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies who participated in the
invasion now condemn it.
   Although a normal working day, much of Tuesday was given over to
observing the invasion's 22nd anniversary.
   At daybreak, costumed members of the ``Jester Society'' student
group swarmed through subway stations in a mock invasion of the
city.
   Also Tuesday, Mayor Jaroslav Koran made seven Soviets honorary
citizens of Prague. The seven were arrested after they staged a
demonstration in Moscow protesting the invasion shortly after
Warsaw Pact troops moved into Czechoslovakia.
   Koran also formally stripped the honorary citizenship of Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin; Klement Gottwald, Czechoslovakia's first
Communist president, and Gustav Husak, the Communist Party leader
installed by Moscow after the invasion.

   Engineers lost radio contact with the
Magellan spacecraft Tuesday night for the second time in five days,
NASA said.
   Scientists weren't immediately sure if the spacecraft's computer
circuits would send out a radio beam in an attempt to re-establish
communication with Earth, as the Venus-orbiting craft is supposed
to do in an emergency, NASA said.
   Magellan's mission is to map up to 90 percent of Venus' surface
using radar to peer through the planet's thick clouds, which
prevent the use of optical cameras. The spacecraft went into orbit
around Venus Aug. 10 after a roundabout, 948-million-mile trip. It
was launched from the shuttle Atlantis 15 months ago.
   ``They lost it at 7:03 p.m. PDT'' while tracking the craft with
a NASA antenna dish near Canberra, Australia, said Jim Doyle,
spokesman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The mishap came only hours after NASA released the spacecraft's
first pictures of Earth's closest planetary neighbor. They showed
Venus has quake faults, lava flows like those in Hawaii and Idaho,
and long, parallel valleys and ridges similar to those between the
Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
   The loss of Magellan, the centerpiece of a $744 million mission
to explore Venus, would be a major blow to NASA, which grounded the
shuttle fleet temporarily because of fuel leaks and found the
Hubble Space Telescope had a flawed mirror.
   Doyle said that if the craft was beaming radio waves across the
sky while spinning _ as it is supposed to do to in an emergency _
engineers could re-establish intermittent contact between 12:03 and
12:30 a.m. PDT Wednesday.
   Less than seven hours before contact broke off, project manager
Tony Spear said that as far as engineers could tell, ``the
spacecraft is healthy,'' despite a loss of contact for more than 14
hours starting last Thursday night.
   The spacecraft's automatic self-protection system made Magellan
re-establish with NASA engineers last Friday morning. Then, they
sent Magellan a command to make it stop spinning and stay in touch
with Earth.
   Engineers said they still haven't figured out why they lost
contact with Magellan last week.
   One leading theory is that a cosmic ray or a high-energy
particle from the sun caused a blip in Magellan's computer memory,
said spacecraft system engineer John Slonski.
   ``We're not ruling out a software flaw or some hardware
problem'' or perhaps some unknown electrical fields surrounding
Venus, Spear said.
   Cosmic ray ``hits'' on spacecraft electronics can be expected to
interfere with Magellan about once each year, Spear said. Similar
events occasionally have disrupted the Pioneer Venus Orbiter,
launched in 1978, and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites in
Earth orbit, Slonski said.
   The pictures released Tuesday were taken during an Aug. 16 test
when Magellan bounced its radar beam off Venus for the first time.
   As promised by NASA, the pictures are 10 times more detailed
than the best radar images of Venus made by the Soviet Venera 15
and 16 spacecraft and by the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto
Rico. They show details as small as 400 feet across, or a third
bigger than the length of a football field.
   The large number of fractures and ``Venusquake'' faults seen in
images from the spacecraft suggest the crustal movements that
shaped the landscape are ``perhaps even more violent than I
imagined before,'' said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``Overlapping lava flows of various ages'' and six to 10 miles
wide appear as bright and dark splotches, he said.
   But Saunders said the pictures don't yet show any of Venus'
major volcanoes, whether any of them are active or if the planet's
crust is broken into the kind of drifting plates that carry whole
continents across the face of the Earth. Previous spacecraft
revealed numerous mountainous volcanoes.
   The lava flows are ``similar geologically to volcanic deposits
seen on Earth at Hawaii and the Snake River Plains in Idaho,'' NASA
said in a statement.
   The parallel sets of elongated valleys and ridges resemble those
in the basin-and-range province of the intermountain region of Utah
and Nevada, or at the Great Rift Valley in eastern Africa. They
show that at least part of Venus' crust has been stretched apart,
Saunders said.

<HEAD>Nazi-Style Beer Hall To Get Facelift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese brewer pressured by a petition drive
says it will revamp a beer hall modeled after the stadium Hitler
built to host the 1936 Olympics.
   Suntory Ltd. made the announcement Tuesday, four days after
receiving a petition signed by more than 60 people objecting to the
``fascist motif'' of Malt's Stadium.
   The beer hall opened three months ago in the chic Aoyama
district of Tokyo. It was modeled after the Berlin stadium that
Adolf Hitler intended to be a showcase for what he considered
German superiority during the 1936 summer games.
   Four imposing columns line the front of the restaurant. The
entrance is flanked by two statues made of styrofoam, and the roof
is decorated with a horse-drawn chariot. Statues of athletes dangle
from the ceiling inside.
   There are no swastikas.
   Geraldine Harcourt, a translator from New Zealand, and American
free-lance writer Leza Lowitz organized the petition, which
received support from Japanese as well as foreigners. It demanded
the immediate removal of decor that ``symbolizes the era of Nazism
which brought about the death of over 6 million people.''
   ``Suntory is very insensitive to use an image of the Berlin
Olympics, which was the showcase of Hitler,'' Ms. Harcourt said.
``There are other possible designs (Suntory) could have copied.''
   Ms. Harcourt had earlier complained about the restaurant's
showing of a documentary on the 1936 Olympics that included shots
of Hitler. Suntory stopped showing the film.
   Suntory clearly was taken aback by the criticism.
   ``We had never thought about the connection between the Berlin
Olympics and the Nazis,'' said company spokesman Masashide Kanzaki.
   Hiroko Uchimi, a spokeswoman for the public relations firm
representing the bar, said the ``idea was to introduce architecture
with a masculine image, and to emphasize it with a sense of
aggressiveness in sports.''
   Sports is the theme of the restaurant.
   ``We never had any complaints from other customers here,'' she
said.
   Suntory officials met with the two petitioners and agreed to
change the exterior to remove the offending design, Kanzaki said.
   He said the company would publicly ``admit that we were ignorant
of such historic issues and that we offended people.''
   Ms. Harcourt said she was pleased by Suntory's response.
   The restaurant was packed Monday night and it appeared most of
the customers were oblivious to the controversy.
   Haruhiko Sato, a 44-year-old interior designer drinking beer
with a colleague, said he did not connect the entrance with Nazi
Germany.
   ``We don't know much about Nazi history, but it has very little
to do with us Japanese, especially today when we enjoy peace,'' he
said.
   Takashi Saito, a professor of international politics at Tokyo's
Gakushuin University who specializes in Nazi history, said Japanese
generally are less sensitive about the horrors of Nazism than
Westerners.
   ``The younger generation especially tends to be oblivious of the
issue,'' he said.
   Japan is not the only Asian nation where the commercial use of
Nazi imagery has stirred controversy.
   In May 1988, a ``Nazi Bar'' featuring caricatures of Hitler and
photos of storm troopers opened in Bangkok, Thailand. Waiters wore
swastika-emblazoned arm bands.
   The owner said he picked the Nazi theme because of its
``powerful, catchy and emotive appeal,'' but complaints prompted
the bar to change its name after about a month. The decor also was
changed.
   Nazi symbols also have been a hit in Japan. A Tokyo fad a few
years ago was collecting items bearing the swastika and other Nazi
symbols.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Challenges NRC Decision on Low-level Waste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two dozen groups are challenging in
court a Nuclear Regulatory Commission decision to ease controls on
the disposal of low-level nuclear wastes.
   The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals here Tuesday,
says the new policy means unhealthy levels of radiation could be
left in the soil and buildings at closed nuclear power plants and
that radioactive contamination could drift into the ground water at
garbage dumps.
   It also alleges the NRC did not provide for adequate public
participation before issuing the new policy in June.
   ``The NRC's rule trades off people's lives in favor of the
financial interests of the nuclear industry,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, one of the groups that filed the
lawsuit.
   The NRC said it would, on a case-by-case basis, deregulate the
disposal of certain low-level atomic wastes from nuclear power
plants, hospitals, laboratories and other facilities if the
radioactive emissions are considered ``below regulatory concern.''
   Other groups joining the lawsuit were the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Nuclear
Information and Resource Service and Physicians for Social
Responsibility.

heyday, says Sen. Joseph R. Biden.
   ``Asian Triads will be the dominant organized crime force in
this country by the middle of this decade,'' the Delaware Democrat
said Tuesday.
   He said Triads _ highly secretive criminal societies born in
China centuries ago _ could have 9,000 members in the United States
in 10 years. That is double the Justice Department estimate of Cosa
Nostra strength at its peak in the 1960s.
   FBI officials confirmed the problem is growing.
   ``It's coming at us and its coming at us real quick and we
better be ready,'' said Robert M. Bryant, deputy assistant director
in the FBI's criminal investigative division.
   Biden and Bryant both stressed that criminals represent only a
tiny sliver of the Asian-American community. ``Most Asian-Americans
are hard-working, law-abiding, patriotic citizens,'' Bryant said.
   Their comments came at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
Biden is chairman of the committee.

<HEAD>Report Shows Sharp Rise in Food Stamp Recipients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report showing a sharp rise in
the number of food stamp recipients demonstrates there are more
poor people in the United States than many wish to admit, says Rep.
Tony Hall, D-Ohio.
   ``It shows you to a certain extent the sleeping giant that is
out there,'' Hall said Tuesday in a statement released in response
to published reports of an Agriculture Department study on food
stamps.
   He said the findings in the report demonstrate how even a slight
downturn in the economy can be too much for some people, throwing
them onto public assistance rolls.
   The report, a summary of which was furnished by the Agriculture
Department on Tuesday, said the number of people using food stamps
rose by more than 1 million between the second quarter of fiscal
1989 and the second quarter of this fiscal year.
   The rise extended to 44 states and the District of Columbia,
varying in size and timing from state to state. Nearly half the
total increase was attributable to a rise in recipients in Texas,
California and Florida, the report said.
   The House earlier this month approved a farm bill that would
expand access to the food assistance program. The House approved
$18.1 billion for fiscal 1991. The Senate has yet to act.
   The Agriculture Department study was undertaken at the request
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which was concerned about
the recent rise in recipients.
   The Bush administration, anticipating 18.1 million food stamp
recipients this year, requested $13.3 billion for fiscal 1990.
Congress approved $14.8 billion and later provided an additional
$1.2 billion when the initial amount proved to be too low.

   ``Cosby Show'' actress Lisa Bonet
wants a judge to order the National Enquirer to hand over a
negative of her baby daughter.
   She alleges the negative showing her then month-old daughter,
Zoe Kravitz, was stolen by a drug store clerk from the Reseda,
Calif., pharmacy that developed her photographs.
   Her lawyers asked in papers filed in federal court Monday that
``the seedier elements of the paparazzi'' produce the negative.
   She has sued the American Drug Stores Inc. chain for unspecified
compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. Her
lawyers say the negative will prove a clerk stole it to sell to the
National Enquirer.
   She alleges a missing photo from the roll appeared in the
supermarket tabloid on Jan. 10, 1989.
   American Drug Stores denies the allegations, said spokesman Carl
Haupt.
   Attorneys for the magazine refused to comment.

   Caesars Palace said it will present evidence
that Rodney Dangerfield has ``severe problems with cocaine,
marijuana and alcohol abuse'' if the comedian's lawsuit against the
resort goes to trial.
   Dangerfield's attorney, Barry Langberg, called the allegations
``a joke.''
   The 64-year-old comedian is seeking $225,000 in damages from
Caesars. He claimed he suffered severe eye damage when he was
scalded by a burst of steam when entering a steam room behind the
hotel's showroom in 1988.
   The resort has filed a breach-of-contract countersuit against
its former headliner for $100,000 plus punitive damages.
   In court papers filed Monday, the resort instead blamed
Dangerfield's lifestyle and his use of a certain type of eyedrops
for his eye problems.
   The document said a witness will testify that at a party after
the alleged incident, Dangerfield was ``so intoxicated from drugs
and alcohol that he literally passed out face first in a plate of
food.''
   Dangerfield claimed he had to cancel five performances at
Caesars because of the injury, at $45,000 per show.
   The trial opens Monday in federal court.

   An attorney for New Kids on the Block claimed
USA Today and the tabloid Star magazine infringed on the pop
group's copyright by setting up for-profit telephone lines about
the band.
   Attorney Jim Warren said at a hearing Monday in federal court
that the publications' use of 900 numbers to gauge the group's
popularity is a way of making money and is thus covered by
trademark laws.
   But lawyers for the Star and USA Today said the 900 lines, for
which callers pay a fee, were used for news-gathering and were
protected by the First Amendment.
   ``We're in the business of reporting that information,'' said
Charles Diamond, a lawyer for Gannett Satellite Information Network
Inc., which publishes USA Today.
   The judge did not immediately issue a ruling.

   Film director Roman Polanski, a fugitive
since 1977 for having sex with a 13-year-old girl, can send a
lawyer to defend himself against a lawsuit filed by the victim, a
state appeals court ruled.
   In a 2-1 ruling Monday, the court said Polanski did not forfeit
the right to defend himself by his ``reprehensible, irresponsible
and unlawful absence.''
   A lawyer for the woman said the ruling will be appealed to the
state Supreme Court.
   Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to unlawful sexual intercourse
with a minor at the home of actor Jack Nicholson. He fled before
being sentenced and now lives in Paris.
   The unidentified victim sued in 1988 for damages for physical
and emotional distress.
   The woman asked for a default ruling against Polanski _ that is,
a ruling declaring him the loser. She argued that a fugitive should
not be allowed to use the courts to defend himself.
   Superior Court Judge George Dell refused to find Polanski in
default, and the appeals court agreed.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall Sharply, Dollar Rises in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern over prospects in the Middle East and
overnight declines on overseas stock markets sent share prices in
Tokyo falling sharply Wednesday, traders said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 1,086.93
points, or 4.13 percent, to close at 25,210.91. The index shed
192.63 points on Tuesday.
   The dollar closed at 146.92 yen, up 0.37 yen from Tuesday's
close. After opening at 146.57 yen, the currency ranged between
146.50 yen and 146.95 yen.
   In bond dealings, the No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond
was quoted at 83.03 points as of 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT), down from
Tuesday's close of 83.22. The yield stood at 8.105 percent, up from
8.06 percent.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei's drop to declines on Wall Street
and major European markets stemming from gloomy prospects for
stability in the Persian Gulf crisis, declining domestic bond
prices and rising oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 52.48 points to
2,063.96 amid concern about the Middle East.
   ``How the situation between Iraq and the United States will
develop is everyone's concern, and there is hardly any reason to
buy issues,'' said Makoto Suzuki, an analyst with Nomura Securities.
   North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was valued at
$27.63 a barrel in Tokyo, up slightly from Tuesday's $27.38.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range,
carried over from overnight trading in New York, where the currency
closed at 146.80 yen, up from 146.51 yen.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said the Tokyo foreign exchange market's reaction to
conditions in the Middle East has diminished mainly because the
crisis had been factored into the market as a chronic problem.
   In times of international turmoil, the dollar usually is
regarded as a safe-haven, although economic trouble in the United
States has dimmed its attractiveness in recent trading.

<HEAD>Study: Boys are Just as Likely as Girls to Have Reading Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Boys are just as likely as girls to have
reading disabilities but are more likely to be diagnosed by
teachers as having the handicap because of their rambunctiousness,
says a study published today.
   ``The very commonly held notion that there are more reading
disabled boys than girls is really not an accurate one,'' said Dr.
Sally E. Shaywitz, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Yale
School of Medicine.
   More boys than girls wind up in special education classes,
apparently because of the long-held and mistaken belief that
overactivity and other behavior problems go hand in hand with the
learning problem, the study said.
   The result has been that some boys _ who typically are more
rambuctious than girls _ are wrongly being labeled reading
disabled, Shaywitz said.
   At the same time, some girls _ and some boys _ are not receiving
the help they need because they show no behavior problems, Shaywitz
said.
   Shaywitz and her fellow researchers followed more than 400
children from 12 towns in Connecticut from kindergarten through the
third grade. The findings were reported in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Tests showed that roughly the same number of boys as girls had a
reading disability, but two to four times as many boys were placed
in special reading classes.
   Dr. James Kavanagh, deputy director for The Center for Research
For Mothers and Children, in Bethesda, Md., welcomed the study but
said more work is needed.
   ``It's done carefully, and it makes good sense,'' he said. ``Our
conventional wisdom has always said that boys have more of these
problems.''
   About 2 million children in the United States are designated as
learning disabled. Most are found to have a reading disability,
defined as a reading problem that can't be explained by a student's
intellectual ability, she said.
   Students with dyslexia, for example, often reverse their letters
or have trouble with their memory or visual perception that makes
reading difficult. Children with dyslexia can be taught to read
when their disorder is recognized.
   The study found a possible explanation for the mislabeling in
the way teachers view the behavior of boys and girls.
   Children who were identified by their schools as reading
disabled but who did not meet the researchers' criteria were
significantly more likely to show behavior problems. Conversely,
children who needed special reading help but were well behaved
tended to be overlooked by the system, the study found.
   The schools identified 27 of 198 second-grade boys and seven of
216 second-grade girls as reading disabled. By the third grade, 20
of 199 boys were labeled reading disabled by their schools,
compared to nine of 215 girls.
   Meanwhile, the researchers found 13, or 45 percent, of the
third-graders receiving special education didn't have a reading
disability after all.
   ``By putting the wrong labels on the wrong individuals people
are not getting quite the right services they need,'' Shaywitz said.
   Shaywitz said her study shows that doctors should not rely soley
on schools to identify children with learning disabilities.

   Sharply dressed Kuwaiti protesters have protested
Saddam Hussein's invasion of their oil-rich homeland, while their
embassies across Europe are busy helping financially strapped
countrymen wait out the crisis.
   ``Saddam, Saddam, you are Hitler!'' about 200 demonstrators
chanted Tuesday outside the Kuwaiti Embassy at yet another
morale-boosting rally against the Iraqi president.
   Most of the demonstrators were women, some dressed in Dior or
St. Laurent, others in traditional Arab robes. Most of the men,
they say, have gone to join the Kuwaiti resistance.
   Other European habitats of the rich also have been scenes of
such demonstrations.
   Rolls-Royces bring their owners to anti-Iraq demonstrations in
Geneva. Kuwaitis march in beachwear along the chic Promenade des
Anglais in Nice in southern France.
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, about 20,000 Kuwaitis were
estimated in London, away from the Persian Gulf's searing heat.
   Kuwaiti embassies and consular offices are helping with the
expenses of those left behind and providing any news of relatives.
   The embassy in London arranges for those without housing to
return to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf
Cooperation Council states, which have offered their oil wealth to
assist Kuwaitis.
   Kuwaiti honorary consul Boerge Hansen and Kuwaiti Airlines in
Copenhagen had offered to pay hotel bills and arrange air tickets
for those stranded in Denmark.
   In Rome, the Kuwaiti Embassy said it was paying rent and
long-distance telephone bills for some of its citizens.
   The embassy in Bern, Switzerland, set up a fund for needy
Kuwaitis, but found no takers.
   ``Almost all who are here are well-to-do,'' said Abdel Aziz
Abouzeid, spokesman at Kuwait's U.N. mission in Geneva. ``Nearly
all have Swiss accounts. They have money, so they are staying.''
   However, five-star hoteliers on Lake Geneva and in Cairo say
there are markedly fewer free-spending guests from Kuwait.
   ``We came here on holiday to go to the theater, the cinema and
for the shopping,'' said a 21-year-old university student outside
the embassy in London.
   ``Kuwaitis love shopping, but it has all been canceled,'' said
the student, who said he feared reprisals against his family and
identified himself only as Mohammed.
   News reports of a suicide car bombing that killed Iraqi soldiers
in Kuwait City boosted exiles' morale, said Khaled Al-Hajen, 31,
another demonstrator.
   ``The resistance is strong, but they do not have efficient guns.
Some are using hunting guns,'' he said.
   The largest number of stranded Kuwaitis are in the gulf
countries, where many young men say they are eager to join the
resistance.
   ``We will fight, win or die,'' said Bandar al-Shallahi of the
Kuwait News Agency in Bahrain. ``It's pointless to live without a
country.''

<HEAD>Parliament Votes To Remove Red Star and Other Communist Symbols</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has voted to remove the red
star and other Communist symbols from buildings and the national
flag after a protester threatened to set himself on fire if the
decision were not taken.
   The state BTA news agency said Parliament adopted a decision
Tuesday to remove ``all insignia of foreign countries.''
   The red star and the hammer and sickle were adopted from the
Soviet model by Communist leaderships in Bulgaria and other Eastern
European countries.
   On Monday the governing Socialist Party, the former Communist
Party, said it would remove the red star from the party
headquarters building in downtown Sofia.
   Despite the decisions, an unspecified number of anti-Communist
protesters surrounded the Socialist Party headquarters, chanting
``Down with the BCP!'' the abreviation of the Bulgarian Communist
Party, BTA said.
   The Communist Party renamed itself the Socialist Party earlier
this year. It won the majority in multiparty elections in June.
   Petar Dertliev, the popular leader of the opposition Social
Democratic Party, assured the crowd that the symbols would be
removed and that ousted long-time Communist leaders and other
former functionaries would be held responsible for wrongdoings
during the four decades of Communist rule.
   Plamen Stanchev, a 20-year-old worker, had threatened Monday to
set himself on fire if the red star were not removed from the
Socialist Party headquarters.
   BTA did not say when the symbols would be removed. But the
Socialist Party said Monday the red star, which is perched on a
pinnacle on top of the party headquarters shining over the city
center, would be dismantled Friday or Saturday.
   The white, green and red Bulgarian flag has a red star above the
coat-of-arms. BTA said the star would be removed from the flag as
well.

<TEXT>
   Georgia's parole board says it commuted a
killer's sentence to life in prison one day before he was to be
executed because he never was tried by a jury and because relatives
of the victim had pleaded for mercy.
   William Neal Moore, 39, received the commuted sentence Tuesday
hours after he had won a 30-day stay of execution from the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   Moore, who had been scheduled to die today in the electric
chair, will be eligible for parole in nine years _ after he has
served 25 years.
   The board's unanimous decision stemmed largely from the fact
that no jury ever weighed Moore's fate, said board chairman Wayne
Snow Jr.
   But he said, ``We're not suggesting there would be any
difference in what the jury would decide.''
   Moore had pleaded guilty to murder in 1974. But a judge
sentenced him to die anyway, a decision that would have rested with
a jury had Moore gone to trial.
   The board also received messages on Moore's behalf from Mother
Teresa and Jesse Jackson. Several nieces and cousins of the victim
appeared at Tuesday's board meeting, testifying on behalf of the
born-again Christian. A family spokesman said relatives of the
victim were ``very positive'' and forgiving of Moore.
   ``To say the least, the board was much impressed by the fact
that we did have family of the victim who asked for clemency.
That's not something we often see,'' said Snow.
   He also said the board was impressed by Moore's good prison
record but wasn't moved by his jailhouse conversion _ ``We hear
that all the time.''
   It was the third time the board has commuted the death sentence
of a Georgia death-row inmate since capital punishment was
reinstated in 1976.
   The other cases involved conspirators who had been sentenced to
death when the actual killer got life in prison.
   Moore was convicted of killing Fredger Stapleton, 74, in 1974. A
friend had told Moore, a depressed 23-year-old soldier from Fort
Gordon, that Stapleton kept $20,000 in his home, according to
testimony. Moore got drunk and Stapleton fired at him when he
entered the home. Moore shot back, killing the man.
   The Columbus, Ohio, native said he joined the Army as a
teen-ager, compiled a spotless record and was weighing a military
career when his wife, his childhood sweetheart, soured on military
life and left him, taking their 2-year-old son.

   China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, turned 86
today, but there was no public observance of his birthday in the
capital.
   Deng, who is reported to suffer from cancer, has retired from
all his Communist Party and government posts but still has final
say over policy and important decisions.
   Deng's last public appearance was July 3, when he toured the
Asian Games village and visited Beijing's tallest skyscraper.
Reports said he walked unaided up the 28 steps to a platform on a
track and field course and declined a seat during the elevator ride
up the skyscraper.
   He is believed to be vacationing at Beidaihe, the seaside resort
to which he and other leaders retire every August.
   Last year, newspapers marked Deng's birthday by trumpeting the
publication of a new collection of his speeches. That announcement
followed months of publicity that seemed to signal an emerging
personality cult after the June 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters.

<TEXT>
   An actors' union decision to let a white man
play a Eurasian pimp in ``Miss Saigon'' wasn't enough for its
producer, who says the hit London musical won't see Broadway unless
he's free to cast other roles.
   Cameron Mackintosh's decision could cost him $600,000 already
spent and $25 million in advance ticket sales, but he said Tuesday
the principle comes first.
   ``I cannot in good conscience reschedule the production in the
absence of a positive working environment and an understanding ...
that artistic freedom of choice cannot be compromised,'' Mackintosh
said in a statement.
   Mackintosh said he was willing to work out differences with the
union, Actors' Equity, and had sent a letter spelling out his
worries.
   Equity had no comment on Mackintosh's decision.
   The union Aug. 7 had barred Jonathan Pryce from re-creating his
award-winning role when the show comes to Broadway in March.
Mackintosh then canceled the show. Under pressure from its members,
the union reversed itself Thursday.
   A rapproachment could bring ``Miss Saigon'' to Broadway in
April. The show stands to become the most expensive Broadway
production ever.
   The show has a cast of 50, including 34 roles for minorities.
The Pryce role is the only one in the cast that has been announced.
The musical is a love story about an American soldier in Vietnam
during the final days of the war in 1975.
   Equity, representing 37,500 members, initially said it couldn't
``appear to condone the casting of a Caucasian in the role of a
Eurasian.''
   Mackintosh said Equity's reversal last week was insufficient
evidence that the union had a change of heart.
   In explaining its reversal, the union said Pryce could come to
Broadway because he was a ``star.'' Actors' Equity has veto power
over foreign actors in the United States but usually does not
interfere with those deemed ``stars.''
   ``Their decision was made solely on the technical basis of Mr.
Pryce's acknowledged star status,'' Mackintosh said. ``As I have
repeatedly stated, it is also essential that the profoundly
unpleasant atmosphere currently surrounding the production be
dispelled.''
   Pryce won a 1977 Tony for his work in ``Comedians'' and won the
Olivier Award, the London equivalent of the Tony, for his portrayal
of the brothel owner in ``Miss Saigon.''
   Asian-American groups had urged Equity to stand firm against
Pryce, citing the dearth of good roles for minority actors.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hundreds of demonstrators shouting
``Down with Poverty!'' marched through the slums and some shattered
car windows, demanding that President Ertha-Pascal Trouillot resign.
   Police dispersed the 300 demonstrators after about two hours and
arrested three protesters, radio Haiti-Inter reported.
   Demonstrators shattered the windows of several cars parked
outside the Legislative Palace, where the Council of State, which
governs alongside the president, was meeting.
   Several demonstrators interviewed by the radio said the protest
was organized by slum neighborhood committees. But they said the
march was infiltrated by supporters of ousted dictator Jean-Claude
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, who was ousted in 1986.
   The president of the Council of State, Louis Roy, said anonymous
callers had telephoned the Legislative Palace and threatened
several council members with death.
   About 50 people unfurled the red-and-black Duvalierist flag in
front of the Legislative Palace and several motorists followed the
marchers giving protesters free bottles of rum.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a former Supreme Court justice, was
appointed president in March to head a civilian caretaker
government after military leader Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril was deposed
following mass protests.
   She is to govern until elections are held, which are tentatively
scheduled for Nov. 4.
   But unhappiness over recent political murders and the return of
several figures associated with the repressive Duvalier family
regime that ruled Haiti for 29 years has cast doubts that free and
fair elections can be held.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot has come under increasing pressure to
resign from several political groups and some members of the
Council of State, a quasi-legislative body that shares power with
her caretaker government.

<HEAD>Stocks Down Sharply, Dollar Up in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange tumbled
sharply today in the ninth-largest daily plunge, nudging the dollar
up against the yen in Tokyo.
   Traders said concern over prospects in the Middle East,
overnight declines on overseas stock markets, slumping domestic
bond market and rising interest rates all contributed to the slide.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 1,086.93
points, or 4.13 percent, to close at 25,210.91. It was the
ninth-largest loss ever recorded by the index, which had shed
192.63 points Tuesday.
   Today's close was the lowest since Feb. 26, 1988, when the index
closed at 25,165.18 points.
   A total of 360 million shares changed hands on the first
section, up from Tuesday's 280 million shares.
   ``There were almost no buyers because of a wait-and-see mood
prevailing in the market,'' said Kyuhei Sato, an equity analyst
with Yamaichi Securities.
   ``Worries among investors over the stock market's future trend
strengthened because of uncertainties over stability in the Middle
East,'' he said.
   Following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, a multinational
force led by U.S. troops has been pouring into the Middle East to
stop further aggression.
   Sato said the market already has factored in the ``current
stalemate'' between Iraq and the United States, but investors are
worried about a deterioration of the sitution that an exchange of
fire could bring.
   In the currency market, the dollar closed at 146.92 yen, up 0.37
yen from Tuesday's close. It opened at 146.57 and ranged between
146.50 and 146.95.
   ``Affected by the stock market's plunge, the dollar-yen trading
was rather mixed today,'' said Yuichi Tsuchiko, a dealer with Fuji
Bank.
   On the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 110 10-year
Japanese government bond closed at 82.63 points, down from
Tuesday's close of 83.22. The yield stood at 8.200 percent, up from
8.060 percent.
   Meanwhile, Persian Gulf oil prices moved slightly higher. Dubai
Fateh crude for October delivery was valued at about $26.55-$26.65
a barrel, higher than the $25.90 late Tuesday in New York.
   The price for October delivery of North Sea Brent was $27.75 a
barrel, up from the $27.75 quoted late Tuesday in New York.

   For the first time in two years, ``60
Minutes'' was the most-watched show on TV, its ratings apparently
boosted by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   A week earlier, interest in the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
prompted more viewers to watch the network news than prime-time
programs.
   The latest ratings released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co.
showed entertainment shows back on top with an average rating of
27.8, compared with 27 for evening news shows. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 households.
   CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' ordinarily one of the top 20 shows and
often one of the top 10, was No. 1 with a rating of 15.8 on Sunday
after giving coverage to the Gulf crisis. ``Cheers'' on NBC and
``Roseanne'' on ABC tied for second at 15.1.
   In the overall network ratings, NBC was No. 1 for the 14th
consecutive week, with an average of 9.7. CBS busted out of its
usual last-place standing to become the No. 2 network with a 9.2
average. ABC had an 8.9.
   In entertainment, Fox Broadcasting's ``The Simpsons'' and
``Married ... With Children'' were back in the top 10, landing in
the No. 4 and No. 8 spots, respectively.
   The first of Maria Shriver's occasional specials for NBC tied
with the powerhouse ``Cosby Show'' for 12th. The slickly produced
installment of ``Cutting Edge with Maria Shriver'' contained
interviews with football player Lyle Alzado, pop singer Sinead
O'Connor and ``Cheers'' star Kirstie Alley.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``60
Minutes,'' CBS, 15.8; ``Cheers,'' NBC, and ``Roseanne,'' ABC, (tie)
15.1; ``The Simpsons,'' Fox, 13.7; ``Designing Women,'' CBS, 13.6;
``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 13.4; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC,
13; ``Coach,'' ABC, and ``Married ... With Children,'' Fox, (tie)
12.8; ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS, and ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC, (tie)
12.6.

   A mob informant whose recordings led to
charges against 41 people wore a ``wire'' to his own initiation
into the Mafia, during which he took a blood oath to ``burn in hell
if I betray my friends.''
   State police Tuesday arrested 29 people, including John Riggi,
reputed boss of the DeCavalcante crime family, and the son of
jailed Philadelphia-New Jersey mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky''
Scarfo. More arrests were expected today.
   The arrests _ on charges including racketeering, gambling,
bribery and drug trafficking _ were based on information provided
by George Fresolone, an informant in the Scarfo organization who is
now in hiding, authorities said.
   During the year-long investigation of the Scarfo, Gambino,
Colombo, Luchese, Genovese and DeCavalcante Mafia families, he
recorded more than 400 conversations through this summer, when he
was initiated into the Scarfo mob.
   It is only the second time in history that the secret initiation
rite has ever been recorded, officials said.
   During the ceremony in the Bronx, Fresolone's trigger finger was
pricked to draw blood, authorities said.
   The five initiates then recited an oath _ ``May I burn in hell
if I betray my friends in the family'' _ while rubbing out a piece
of paper set on fire in their palms.
   A gun and a knife present at the ceremony signified that members
``live by the gun and die by the gun, live by the knife and die by
the knife,'' authorities said.
   The recordings detail how the Mafia families cooperated in
setting up illegal activities and shared profits from bookmaking,
loansharking, illegal video machines, drug distribution, municipal
corruption, union control and violence, said Col. Justin Dintino,
spokesman for the state police.
   Although Scarfo is serving a 69-year federal sentence in
Illinois, authorities said their investigation showed he was
channeling messages to his organization through his son, Nicodemo
Scarfo Jr., 25, during prison visits.
   The younger Scarfo's arrest will likely deal the elder Scarfo a
devastating blow, Dintino said. Scarfo's son was ``someone that he
completely trusts'' and whom he had envisioned as the future boss
of the crime family, Dintino said.

<HEAD>Washers Didn't Hobble Hubble, NASA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA says it has ruled out the possibility
that household washers in a measuring device caused the Hubble
Space Telescope's focusing flaw.
   ``Just when we thought we knew, we're back to square one,'' said
Charles Pellerin, NASA director of astrophysics. ``It's
frustrating.''
   NASA investigators had suggested last week that improperly
installed washers 1.3 millimeters thick might have caused the
1.3-millimeter flaw in the mirror, which is producing blurred
images from the orbiting telescope.
   But Pellerin said Tuesday the investigators had only estimated
the thickness of the washers last week. When the washers were
measured, they turned out to be much thinner _ too thin to have
caused the mirror flaw, he said.
   Now, he said it's increasingly possible that the cause of the
mirror flaw was a mathematical error made in transposing the design
of the measuring device, known as a reflective null corrector, from
the drawing board to the assembly room.
   The $1.5 billion telescope was supposed to provide unprecedented
views of outer space. Its 94-inch primary mirror was made from 1979
to 1982 by the Perkin-Elmer Corp., whose optical division in
Danbury was bought last year by Hughes Danbury Optical Systems.
   The NASA team visited Hughes twice to review data and test
results.
   Last Thursday, the investigators said there was an estimated 1.3
millimeter error between the mirror and the field lens of the
reflective null corrector, which guides the grinding and polishing
of a mirror.
   The board's strongest hypothesis was that three washers had
mistakenly been inserted into a plate that held a lens in place in
the null corrector. They weren't certain, though, that the washers
were to blame at all.
   Charles Spoelhof, a member of the investigative team, said the
board only estimated the washers' thickness because they were still
mounted inside the reflective null corrector and weren't accessible.
   When the washers were measured a few days ago at Hughes, they
were found to be just .75 millimeters thick _ by precision optical
standards, a huge spacing difference from the estimated
1.3-millimeter thickness, Pellerin said.

<HEAD>Felon Holds Up Judicial Appointment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A felon serving on a once-obscure state board is
holding up confirmation of a judicial nominee who once worked for
the judge who sent him to prison for assault in 1971.
   Diane Kottmyer, a federal prosecutor nominated to the state
Superior Court by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis five months ago, was a
law student when Joseph ``Jo Jo'' Langone III was given a six-month
sentence. She did not clerk for U.S. District Judge Andrew Caffrey
until 1974 and had no involvement in the case.
   But Langone, for unexplained reasons, holds a grudge against her.
   ``I want to bury her,'' the 73-year-old undertaker said. ``It's
a free funeral. She would go first class, with the motorcycle cops
and everything.''
   His opposition to Kottmyer, 44, who gained a reputation
prosecuting mobsters and corrupt Boston police officers, has put
the eight-member Massachusetts Governor's Council on the political
map.
   The council, which is elected every four years, is a holdover
from colonial days, originally intended to check the power of the
royal governor. Today, it approves all state expenditures and
confirms judicial appointees. Nearly all its actions are routine.
   Because Kottmyer lives in Langone's district outside Boston,
Langone must nominate her before the council can decide whether to
approve her for the judgeship. He has so far refused to do so.
   Langone, a member of the council since 1977, initially suspected
Kottmyer had played a role in recommending that he be sent to
prison for assaulting a drug investigator who had parked his car
outside Langone's funeral parlor. The investigator had not been
keeping surveillance on Langone.
   Though he later learned from news reports that Kottmyer had
nothing to do with his conviction, Langone has still pledged to
stop her nomination.
   Kottmyer has refused to comment.
   Kottmyer helped prosecute reputed Mafia figure Ilario Zannino,
and Langone recently sent a letter to a judge asking that Zannino's
30-year prison sentence be reduced. But he denied his interest in
the Zannino case had anything to do with his opposition to Kottmyer.
   Judicial officials have called on Langone to remove himself from
the nomination process. Former U.S. Attorney William Weld, a
gubernatorial candidate, has called for the council's abolition.
   ``Only in Massachusetts would a convicted felon be able to pass
judgment on the qualifications of a person nominated to the
bench,'' he said.
   Caffrey, who sentenced Langone in 1971, said Langone harbored
``a clearly articulated bias'' against Kottmyer and should step
aside from the nominating process.
   Council members, who need only be a state resident for five
years to be eligible, are up for re-election this year. Langone, a
Democrat, will meet two challengers in the Sept. 18 primary; the
general election is on Nov. 6.
   State law does not prohibit people convicted of a crime from
holding public office unless they engaged in corruption to gain the
job.
   Langone's district includes the predominantly Italian-American
neighborhoods of East Boston and affluent suburbs such as Lexington
and Reading.

   Pakistan today charged 11 Siberian
labor camp prisoners with hijacking a Soviet jetliner and forcing
it to land in the southern port city of Karachi, according to news
reports today.
   The prisoners sought political asylum from Pakistan after the
Aeroflot Tupolev 154 jetliner, with 20 passengers and nine crew
members on board, landed Monday.
   A hijacking conviction carries the death penalty or life
imprisonment. The 11 have also been charged with illegal possession
of firearms, said the independent Dawn daily newspaper, published
in Karachi.
   Four machine guns, three pistols and several rounds of
ammunition were reportedly confiscated from the prisoners, the
newspaper said.
   Pakistan has in the past refused to extradite hijackers,
preferring to try them. Palestinian guerrillas involved in a 1986
Pan Am hijacking in Karachi were tried in Pakistan and sentenced to
death.
   The sentence has not yet been carried out.
   The Soviet prisoners hijacked the jetliner Sunday after
overpowering their guards at Neryungry, 3,100 miles east of Moscow.
   They were being transfered to a prison in the nearby city of
Yakutsk in Eastern Siberia.
   After forcing the aircraft back to Neryangry, where six
prisoners and 41 women and children left the plane, the aircraft
flew west to Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.
   The aircraft refuelled and flew to Tashkent, where a new crew
boarded and the hijackers demanded to leave the country.
   They originally wanted to go to New Delhi but landed in Karachi,
complaining their fuel supply was dangerously low.
   There have been at least 13 hijackings or attempted hijackings
of Soviet aircraft since late May.

   Police said today they have arrested
48 suspected radicals for plotting to overthrow President Roh
Tae-woo's government. Police said the group included 10 soldiers.
   Police said all would be charged with violation of security laws
and face a maximum penalty of death by hanging, a police
announcement said.
   Although the police did not mention North Korea in announcing
the arrests, the government has often accused the Communist country
of instigating anti-government activity in South Korea.
   Police said 17 radicals and the 10 soldiers were arrested
Tuesday. The other 21 people were arrested in separate operations
since March, police said.
   All were involved in the formation of a group called the
Revolutionary Workers Class Struggle Union, which sought to topple
Roh's government through armed revolution, police said.
   Police said most of those arrested were former members of the
now defunct underground student Constitutional Assembly, a radical
group which played a major role in the formation of South Korea's
radical student movement in the early 1980s. The group was outlawed
in 1986 and many members were arrested at that time.
   Police said the group initially called ``Fiery Flower'' was
reorganized and in 1989 became an underground organization.
   Police said the group had plans to attack a munitions area where
weapons were kept for reserve army troops. The location of the
munitions area was not disclosed and the unit the soldiers belonged
to was not disclosed.
   Those under arrest tried to instigate anti-government struggle
among workers and students on college campuses, police said.
   Police released several names of those arrested, but none were
well-known radicals.
   Police said it was hoped other members of the organization would
disband and no more arrests were expected.
   On Saturday, police said 19 students had been charged with
violating the nation's national security law and another 56 were on
the fugitive list. All were charged in connection with writing
articles in praise of North Korea in campus newspapers and
magazines.

   The rancher daughter of an ex-governor won
the GOP nomination for her father's old job and will square off in
November against Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan, who coasted to
victory against a motorcycle mechanic.
   In other primary races Tuesday, Republican Sen. Alan Simpson
handily won nomination for a third term.
   With 96 percent of the vote in, rancher Mary Mead received 67
percent of the vote to 33 percent for 12-year state Rep. Nyla
Murphy.
   Referring to 16 years of Democratic governors, she said, ``The
people in Wyoming that I've talked to think it's time for a
change.''
   Mead, 55, had stressed her skills as a rancher and businesswoman
and attacked the governor's economic development efforts.
   She stands to give Wyoming its first father-daughter combination
in the governor's mansion. Her father, Cliff Hansen, served from
1963 to 1967 before moving on to the U.S. Senate.
   Sullivan easily won nomination for a second term, receiving 88
percent of the vote against mechanic Ron ``Suds'' Clingman.
Clingman had called for lowering the drinking age to 18 and
decriminalizing drugs.
   The governor said he would have preferred stiffer competition.
During the primary campaign, he largely ignored the race.
   Simpson, the Senate minority whip, was nominated with 84 percent
of the vote and will meet little-known Democrat Kathy Helling, a
32-year-old college student.
   Helling, who received 34 percent of the vote in a six-way
Democratic race, said a strong grassroots campaign and her stand
against abortion would make her a formidable opponent, despite
Simpson's financial resources.
   ``It's very gratifying,'' Simpson said of his victory. ``But you
work hard and the people watch you and they want to know how bad
you want it. I hope I disclosed to them I am ready to work for it.''
   Rep. Craig Thomas had no opposition in the primary. Elected last
year to fill Dick Cheney's unexpired term, Thomas is seeking his
first full term in the House.
   Also unopposed was his Democratic challenger, Pete Maxfield, a
University of Wyoming law professor.

   About 1,500 USAir employees will be given
pink slips today and into next week as company officials cancel a
planned expansion.
   In making the announcement Tuesday, airline officials said only
probationary employees would be released in response to a weakening
economy and a lull in the airline business.
   Spokeswoman Susan Young said the employees were hired as part of
the planned expansion.
   USAir flies about 3,000 domestic flights daily, supported by
55,200 employees.
   The cuts are ``across the board, in most departments and in most
geographic areas of the country,'' Young said. She said specifics
were not available but would include all types of employees
anywhere from airport maintenance workers to secretaries.
   ``We deeply regret that this action is necessary, but these
employees were hired in anticipation of an expansion program that
has been reduced in light of current economic projections,'' said
USAir president Seth E. Schofield.
   Young said travel has been flat, the nation's economy weakening,
and the economic climate for the next 12 to 24 months does not look
so good.
   The airline completed a $1.6 billion takeover of Piedmont in
1989 and a $385 million buyout of Pacific Southwest Airlines in
1987. Since then, USAir has grown rapidly under deregulation and
still has plans to add new overseas routes.
   Last week USAir announced it would furlough 211 pilots effective
Jan. 1.

possess or have control over'' the three types of mass destruction
weapons.
   He read a joint statement by both German governments saying,
``They declare that the united Germany, too, will abide by this
obligation.''
   Genscher spoke at a meeting of parties to the 140-nation
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the world's main agreement to prevent the
spread of nuclear weapons. The conference is reviewing
implementation of the 1970 treaty.
   Genscher said the treaty, which both German states have joined,
''will continue to apply to the united Germany.''
   A united Germany will seek an extension of the treaty when the
issue comes up in 1995, he said.
   The treaty binds states that do not possess nuclear weapons not
to make or acquire them.

   The dollar firmed in European trading this
morning. Gold prices declined.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.92 yen, up 0.37 yen from
Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar retreated to 146.40
yen.
   ``Affected by the stock market's plunge, the dollar-yen trading
was rather mixed today,'' said Yuichi Tsuchiko, a dealer with Fuji
Bank in Tokyo.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 1,086.93
points, or 4.13 percent, to close at 25,210.91. It was the
ninth-largest loss ever recorded by the index, which had shed
192.63 points Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.5580 West German marks, up from 1.5545
   _1.2858 Swiss francs, up from 1.2855
   _5.2435 French francs, up from 5.2325
   _1.7590 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7530
   _1,161.75 Italian lire, up from 1,155.75
   _1.1373 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1437
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9195, compared
with $1.9215 late Tuesday.
   ``The market has become so scared to do anything, there isn't
much business in the dollar,'' said Jim O'Neil, international
economist at Swiss Bank Corp. in London.
   He said this will probably prevent the dollar from penetrating
the lows it reached last week at 1.5450 Deutsche marks and 127.70
Swiss francs even if it looks as if the Fed is easing rates.
   At the same time, he added, any knee-jerk rally triggered at the
start of a Persian Gulf conflict will probably take the dollar only
as high as 1.60 marks. ``The basic strategy is still sell the
dollar on a rally,'' he said.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $410 a troy
ounce Tuesday morning, down from $413.25 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $409.90, down from $414.75 late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $1.24 an ounce today, to close at $408.69.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.20.

<TEXT>
   A state newspaper today cautioned Europe
and Japan against backing the United States in the Persian Gulf
crisis, saying their regional interests would be harmed ``if they
walk in the steps of Washington.''
   Another newspaper warned that Iraq would take war ``into the
cities of attacking nations'' and said the Soviet Union also should
realize U.S. interests might harm those of Moscow.
   A third said the United States, which has condemned the holding
of foreign ``hostages'' by Baghdad, is the last country that has a
right to talk about human rights.
   The state-run Al-Gomhuriya warned France, Italy, West Germany
and Japan not to participate in what it termed ``American
occupation of the gulf oilfields.''
   Those nations ``should know where there interests lie so that
they don't blindly follow the American schemes designed to seize
the Arab oil wells,'' the daily said in a front-page editorial.
   The daily accused the United States of ``imposing its hegemony''
on the European countries and Japan and trying to control their
ecnomoies through dominating Arab oil resources.
   It said Europe and Japan risked losing long-term economic
interests in the Arab world if they supported the United States.
   The newspaper said the Europeans and the Japanese should deal
with ``the new and unified Iraq,'' which it described as a
``regional power of wealth and profound history.'' That was a
reference to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2.
   The United States and several Arab nations have sent troops to
Saudi Arabia to defend it against possible Iraqi attack, and
several nations have joined the U.S. by sending warship to the
region to help enforce a U.N. embargo on Iraqi goods.
   The Baghdad Observer warned that any flareup in the gulf will
lead to all-out war.
   ``One should not expect the Iraqis to sit idle when their towns
and population centers are being bombarded by the U.S. planes and
shells. Iraqis will take the war into the cities of the attacking
nations if it is attacked,'' the paper said.
   ``The U.S. wants to impose hegemony on the region and as they
put it, `teach naughty Iraq a lesson.' Washington wants governments
in this part of the region to be weak enough to give in to the
expansionist demands of Israel.
   It said the United States appears to believe it can do anything
it wants ``with no parties daring to challenge it.''
   The paper said ``American military presence in the Middle East
means a defensive line close to the Soviet Union, a line which
would confront any future Soviet attempt to have an influence in
this vitally strategic area.''
   Al-Qadissisya, the Iraqi army newspaper, said, ``He who speaks
about human rights must first have a record book free from crimes
against humanity.''
   It said Iraq's step to keep foreigners in strategic locations to
ward off an attack ``is different from the reality of America's
black history and its record, which is full of crimes against
humanity and struggle of peoples whose territories were under
occupation.''

<HEAD>Professor Targeted by Dartmouth Review Resigns</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, `My effectiveness...' to CORRECT time

<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black music professor has resigned from
Dartmouth College ``liberating'' himself from repeated attacks
during the past seven years by a conservative, off-campus student
weekly newspaper.
   ``I wish I were leaving under more favorable circumstances,''
William Cole said in a prepared statement. ``I know that many
people will feel that the forces which are part of my leaving
Dartmouth have won a major victory. However, this problem is no
longer for me to wrestle with. It is a problem for Dartmouth to
wrestle with.''
   Faculty Dean James Wright said Cole ``never sought to be a
public figure. He joined Dartmouth's faculty to teach, write and
pursue his other professional interests. But some would not permit
this to be.''
   The Dartmouth Review targeted Cole in what it said was a crusade
against the decline of higher education, once describing him as
part of ``Dartmouth's Dynamic Duo of Mediocrity.''
   The Review began attacking his teaching ability and personality
in 1983. An article that year called one music course he taught
``the most outrageous gut course on campus.'' The newspaper also
described him as a ``lean, scruffy fellow'' who ``looks like a used
Brillo pad.''
   Cole filed a $600,000 libel suit against the paper that was
settled out of court two years later for no money.
   He also had a classroom confrontation with student staff members
of the Review, who got a judge to rule they were unfairly suspended
as a result. A federal court threw out the white students'
discrimination claim.
   Cole said at the time he didn't think Dartmouth recognized the
threat the attacks posed to the institution.
   ``It's causing people, irrespective of if they are black, white,
male or female, to think about whether they want to teach here,''
he said in 1988. ``It's causing liberal-minded students to think
about whether they want to come here.''
   ``My effectiveness as a teacher and participant in the Dartmouth
community was compromised,'' Cole said in his statement last week,
by ``a series of events which began in 1983.''
   ``There is a tendency to dwell upon and continue to analyze
these issues,'' he said. ``For my part, the end of my association
with Dartmouth is liberating.''
   Cole said his departure frees him to concentrate on performing,
promoting music of minority artists and participating in
multidisciplinary artistic events.
   Cole came to Dartmouth in 1974 and taught courses in American
jazz and the music of non-Western cultures. He has written books on
jazz artists Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He also has performed
in his own group, Wind and Thunder. He was awarded tenure in 1979
and was promoted to full professor in 1985.

<HEAD>Report: Epidemic of Domestic Violence Largely Overlooked by
Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though domestic violence causes more
injuries to women than auto accidents, muggings and rapes combined,
doctors largely ignore the problem, says a report in a medical
journal.
   But a spokesman for emergency-room physicians says the report
overstates the shortcomings of doctors and fails to show they are
sometimes hampered by a lack of support services or by women's
reluctance to implicate batterers.
   Twenty-two percent to 35 percent of women who visit emergency
departments have symptoms linked to abuse, either physical or
stress-related, said the report in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   ``Thirty-four percent of all female homicide victims older than
15 years are killed by their husbands or intimate partners,'' added
the report by the journal's associate editor Teri Randall, who
cited FBI data from 1976 to 1987.
   ``While most clinicians wouldn't consider discharging a patient
with a life-threatening condition, data from emergency department
records show that a majority of women who are victims of domestic
abuse are discharged without any arrangements made for their
safety, to return to the same abusive relationships that caused
their injuries,'' the report said.
   ``The only physicians who ask about violence are psychiatrists,
and they're only interested if it occurs in a dream. They rarely
ask about the violent events that occur in real life,'' Dr. Mark
Rosenberg, director of injury control for the national Centers for
Disease Control, told the journal.
   But the report ``just might be overstated,'' said Dr. Jack
Allison, vice president of the American College of Emergency
Physicians. He said the report fails to convey that many
communities lack shelters or other services for abused women, and
many women cover up for the wrongdoings of batterers.
   In addition, ``there are still times, unfortunately, when women
go back to those relationships _ they choose not to go to shelter,
choose not to press charges, choose not to get out of the abusive
situation. That's a real frustration for physicians,'' he said in a
telephone interview Tuesday from Greenville, N.C.
   A 1987 study of one urban emergency department indicated
physicians treating victims deliberately injured by other people
rarely asked about the victim's past sexual or physical abuse,
living arrangements or prospects for safety.
   By not asking these questions, the physician lost the
opportunity to address the cause of the patient's medical condition
and closed the door to preventive measures, the study concluded.
   Mildred Dailey Pagelow, a sociology professor at California
State University, Fullerton, told the journal, ``Physicians will
often say, `I'm not a law enforcement officer, and I'm not a social
worker. I'm here to treat the body, and she needs to see a
psychiatrist.''
   Yet a growing number of physicians think the treatment of
domestic violence is a medical matter, the report said.
   ``Quicker than you can put on a Band-Aid, you can acknowledge
the violence, you can assert that this is illegal, not her fault,
and that a lot of women are in this situation,'' said Dr. Anne
Flitcraft, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of
Connecticut, Farmington, and co-director of the New Haven-based
Domestic Violence Training Project.
   ``You can educate her about the community-based resources
available to help her, and ask her, `Are you safe?''' Ms. Flitcraft
told the journal.
   Many hospitals have instituted procedures specifically designed
to help abused patients, the report said.
   For example, specially designated nurses act as patient
advocates, seeing that abused women receive help from a
psychiatrist or social worker, if appropriate, and supplying a
referral list to shelters, legal services and counseling services,
the report said.

<TEXT>
   Two research scientists have been indicted
for allegedly conspiring to sell the trade secrets for two drugs
that cost over $400 million to develop.
   Bernard Mayles, 52, and Mario Miscio, 63, were charged with
conspiracy, wire fraud, mail fraud and interstate transmission of
stolen property. They were indicted Tuesday in U.S. District Court
in Newark.
   If convicted on all counts, each faces a maximum of 30 years in
prison and millions of dollars in fines.
   The drugs involved were ivermectin, a leading anti-parasitic
drug, and interferon, which has shown promise in treating cancer
and hepatitis.
   The two were arrested in Atlanta on Aug. 10. An FBI undercover
agent posing as an international broker with connections in Eastern
Europe and the Third World paid $1.5 million in return for a sheaf
of documents and two tests tubes stored in a cooler of dry ice, the
indictment said.
   At the same meeting, the two agreed to sell the secrets and
microorganisms necessary for the production of interferon for a sum
between $6 million and $8 million, the indictment said.
   Ivermectin, which is patented by Merck for use in a number of
drugs, is also used to treat thousands of people in West Africa and
South America who suffer from river blindness.
   Mayles had worked for 11 years at Merck and Co., and 5 years as
a researcher at Schering-Plough.
   Miscio is the director of Biopharm Research Inc. of Hazlet.
   Pharmaceutical companies spend an average of 12 years and $231
million on research and development to bring a single drug to
market, according to Pamela Adkins, a spokeswoman for Merck.
   U.S. attorney Michael Chertoff said, ``This type of crime
strikes at the heart of the research and development system, at the
type of incentive necessary to develop drugs and bring them to the
marketplace.''

   An expatriate American who slipped past Iraqi
troops disguised as an Arab in a daring escape from Kuwait last
week, arrived home to smiling and crying relatives.
   ``Hello America, I love you,'' Stephanie McGehee called out
Tuesday on entering the terminal at San Diego's international
airport.
   ``It's good to be home,'' said McGehee, a part-time photographer
for The Associated Press who had lived in Lebanon and Kuwait for 13
years.
   McGehee, 37, of Leucadia, fled the Kuwaiti capital for Saudi
Arabia last Friday in the lead car of a 13-vehicle caravan of
Americans and other foreigners.
   Dressed in a floor-length black chador, she used her knowledge
of Arabic dialects to slip past Iraqi troops that invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. But the group was forced back at the last checkpoint, and
they had to drive into the desert and around Iraqi troop positions
to reach Saudi Arabia.
   McGehee's father, Bill, said he was never doubted that his
daughter would escape safely.
   ``I know Stephanie knows how to take care of herself. I know she
has the ability of being able to do what she has to do.''
   McGehee had been in hiding nine days when the Iraqi government
announced it wanted all U.S. and British expatriates to gather at
the International Hotel.
   McGehee said that's when she decided it was time to flee Kuwait.
   ``When I heard Saddam Hussein's speech and he said he would send
Americans home in coffins, I said, `No way. Not me.'''

   Pope John Paul II, in his first public
comment on the crisis caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, spoke
today of the ``danger of war'' and offered a prayer for peace.
   During his weekly general audience the pope spoke about the
threat to world peace, addressing a small group of Japanese
pilgrims.
   ``Today we add to our prayers the danger of a war that threatens
the desired peace in the world,'' the pope said, in Japanese. ``May
the Lord, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
answer our invocations. With this wish, I bless everyone from my
heart.''
   The Vatican press office released a translation of the pope's
remarks.
   On Tuesday, the pope met with the papal envoy to both Iraq and
Kuwait to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis, which began Aug. 2 with
the Iraqi invasion and prompted many nations to send troops to
defend Saudi Arabia.
   On Monday, the Vatican newspaper underlined ``this grave hour in
the history of humanity'' and reprinted messages of peace delivered
decades ago at the United Nations by John Paul and a predecessor,
Paul VI.
   A cautiously-worded editorial about the crisis that appeared
Aug. 8 in the Vatican paper, L'Osservatore Romano. It urged nations
to refrain from resorting to the ``law of the strong.'' The
editorial implicitly criticized Iraq.

   The parents of eight children who include
the country's first test-tube quintuplets will receive about $1,000
a month to care for three nieces, ending a four-month application
process.
   The state Department of Social Service on Tuesday licensed the
home of Raymond and Michele L'Esperance for foster-care, making the
Davisburg family eligible for more benefits to care for its
children. The decision was announced in Oakland County Probate
Court, where the couple had turned in hopes of getting their
license application approved quickly.
   ``We are elated,'' said Raymond L'Esperance, who had been trying
since April to get the license.
   The L'Esperances, parents of eight children from current and
previous marriages, began caring for the 6-, 10- and 13-year-old
nieces last year when the girls' parents sought drug and alcohol
rehabilitation. The couple was receiving $295 monthly from Aid to
Families with Dependent Children, but sought the foster-care
license to qualify for more government aid.
   Oakland County Probate Judge Barry Grant had pushed the
Department of Social Services to act quickly.
   ``It's disturbing to me what could've happened if these children
were not fortunate enough to be wanted by their aunt and uncle,''
Grant said. ``The system, as it presently exists, is not addressing
the needs of children.''
   The L'Esperances had quintuplets in 1988, believed to be the
first conceived in vitro and successfully carried in the United
States. Michele L'Esperance works in a home for battered women. Her
husband is a Macomb County corrections officer and holds a second
job in a tool-and-die shop.
   Michele L'Esperance has said it costs more than $300 a week just
to feed the family.

<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants East
Germany to dissolve and unite with his country on Oct. 6, one day
before East Germany's founding as a sovereign nation, sources said
today.
   The preference of Kohl, who has been able to dictate most of the
pace of unification, throws yet another date into the politically
charged debate over when East Germany should unify.
   West German government sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Kohl wants unity to take place one day before the
41st anniversary of East Germany's founding as a Communist state on
Oct. 7.
   The date was proposed by Guenter Krause, Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere's top aide and the county's leading unification
official. Kohl and de Maiziere are both Christian Democrats who
have been battling with the left-leaning Social Democrats in both
countries over the timing of unity.
   As late as Tuesday, de Maiziere favored that unity take place on
Oct. 14, when elections are held to create the five states that
East Germany will become in a united nation.
   However, East German Social Democrat spokesman Helga Wanke said
today that her party rejected the Oct. 6 date. She said the party
was standing firm on its insistence that unity take place on Sept.
15.
   East Germany will unite by approving a clause in the West
Germany Constitution that allows former German lands to accede to
the Western nation.
   The Social Democrats say they want unity to come in
mid-September so that West Germany can more quickly assume direct
responsibility for East Germany's failing economy.
   Joblessness has been climbing since East Germany converted to a
free market on July 1. But the Social Demcrats also want quick
unity so Kohl, they say, will be forced to admit the true costs of
bailing out the East German economy.
   Both parties are in the midst of a political campaign to lead
the united nation. Common German elections are tentatively set for
Dec. 2.
   An apparent East German agreement to unite on Oct. 14 fell apart
Tuesday amid name-calling and growing rancor. The Social Democrats,
the nation's second-largest party, defied their leader and rejected
unity on that date.
   Richard Schroeder, parliamentary leader of the Social Democrats,
had agreed to the proposal. He quit his post after his party
decided not to accept it.
   The conservative Christian Democrats hold the most votes in
Parliament and are in the best position to set the date for the
historic merger.
   De Maiziere's government has suffered a series of dismissals,
resignations and charges of incompetence in the past week. On
Sunday, the Social Democrats withdrew from de Maiziere's governing
coalition in a dispute over unification.
   Six ministers have resigned or been ousted from the Cabinet in
the past week. The chief of the agency set up to sell East
Germany's ailing enterprises resigned amid criticism of his failure
to unload the businesses.
   Kohl wants to keep unity and electons close together. He lost a
bid to have them both held on the same day, Oct. 14, because that
required rewriting West Germany's constitutional timetable to
elections.
   The East German Parliament must approve unification by a
two-thirds majority, but only a simple majority is needed to set a
date. All the major parties are committed to unification, but the
debate has been reduced to a political brawl over when it should
take place.
   Many details remain to be worked out.
   Fighting between political parties in both Germanys, essentially
in the throes of an election campaign, will likely resurface.
   How to distribute East German property has been a roadblock to a
political treaty that is to mesh the two countries. Some of the
property is claimed by West Germans who fled the region after the
Soviet onrush late in World War II.

   An inmate's stabbing touched off the second
uprising in eight days at the city's Rikers Island jail and left
about 25 guards and four prisoners injured, authorities said today.
   Eighteen inmates barricaded themselves in their cellblock and
set fires Tuesday night after the prisoner was stabbed, said
Correction Department spokeswoman Ruby Ryles. The assailant's
identity was not known, she said.
   Forty guards ended the uprising within 30 minutes, Ryles said.
It was not immediately known if force was used.
   Ryles had said Tuesday night that about 75 people were injured
and that most of them were treated for smoke inhalation. None of
the injuries was life-threatening, Ryles said.
   Twenty-five guards and four inmates were taken to local
hospitals, Emergency Medical Services spokeswoman Gail Christianson
said this morning.
   The extent of the damage to the jail was not immediately known.
   Last week, up to 1,000 guards blockaded the entrance to the
island in the East River for 36 hours, protesting inmate violence
against guards and demanding more authority to use force.
   The blockade left the jail short of staff and prevented inmates
from receiving visitors. As the blockade was ending Aug. 14,
hundreds of prisoners rioted in anger, and 162 guards and inmates
were reported injured, most of them by tear gas.
   During the disturbance, officers were accused of lining up some
inmates and beating them bloody with nightsticks. The city is
investigating the accusations.
   The Rev. Irvine Bryer, a member of the Board of Correction, said
guards told him they forced prisoners into a corridor and beat them
while shouting, ``We control the jails, not you!''
   The blockade ended after guards reached an agreement that
allowed greater leeway in the use of force. But a federal judge
barred the Correction Department from implementing the new rules
and ordered a compromise be reached.

   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) _ As environmental activist drowned in
Keauhou Bay shortly after leading a flotilla of boats and
surfboards in an anti-geothermal protest, police said.
   Dexter Cate, 47, was diving from a kayak Tuesday evening when he
failed to surface, said police Lt. Errol Ishimine.
   Cate was arrested in Japan in 1980 for freeing 300 dolphins from
nets. He was deported following a trial in which he was given a
six-month suspended jail term.
   Cate said he freed the dolphins to call attention to their
slaughter by Japanese fishermen who said the dolphins were
competiting for the same fish and threatening their livelihood.
   Cate, a Hilo High School teacher, had been participating Tuesday
in a demonstration aimed at state-backed plans for development of
major geothermal energy plants in the Wao Kele O Puna rainforest.
The protest was near a hotel where an international symposium on
geothermal development was being held.
   When Cate failed to surface, his 11-year-old son flagged down a
passing boat to get help, Ishimine said.
   His body was recovered from 80 feet of water and the death is
classifed as a public accident, he said.

   An Iraqi tanker that ignored warning
shots from an American warship entered the waters off Yemen's port
of Aden today and dropped anchor near two other Iraqi ships already
anchored there.
   Shipping sources said a U.S. warship shadowed the tanker Baba
Gurgur until it entered Yemeni waters. The tanker was one of two
Iraqi tankers that refused to stop Saturday when U.S. Navy frigates
fired warning shots across their bows.
   Yemen has told the U.N. Security Council that it would turn away
the Baba Gurgur and adhere to the United Nations trade embargo
imposed on Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Yemeni officials would not comment on the tankers today.
However, the official Yemeni news agency quoted an unidentified
Foreign Ministry official on Tuesday as saying Yemen did not intend
to ``intercept or obstruct'' any ships.
   The Red Sea country could still adhere to U.N. sanctions by
simply ignoring the tankers and refusing them permission to load.
Saudi Arabia used a similar ploy to turn away the two other Iraqi
tankers now anchored at Aden.
   Those tankers, the Al-Fao and Al-Qadissiyah, left their
anchorage in the Red Sea off Saudi Arabia last week when they were
unable to load crude.
   Aden port control on Tuesday said the two tankers were anchored
outside the oil terminal in Aden. A Western diplomat said the two
empty tankers may have sailed to Yemen just to tie up in a safe
port.
   The Baba Gurgur is a 36,397-ton Iraqi products carrier, a ship
designed to pick up finished oil products from a refinery for
delivery to distribution points elsewhere.
   Shipping sources said the refinery at Aden has not accepted a
consignment of Iraqi crude in more than a month. Before the crisis,
however, Iraq sent crude to that refinery. It said recently that
the Baba Gurgur was en route to Aden to pick up fuel oil stored
there.
   The Baba Gurgur ignored three warning shots fired across its bow
Saturday by the frigate USS Bradley in the Persian Gulf and sailed
to Yemen shadowed by an unidentified American warship.
   Another Iraqi tanker, the Khanaqin, ignored six warning shots
from the frigate USS Reid in the Gulf of Oman. That ship reportedly
was also sailing toward Yemen.
   A U.S. military spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said on Tuesday that the Khanaqin was still under surveillance. But
he refused to disclose the location of the vessel.
   Shipping sources in Yemen confirmed that the Baba Gurgur was
anchored off Aden but said they also did not know the location of
the Khanaqin.
   The tankers' arrival in Yemen has focused unwanted attention on
its government, which has generally avoided criticism of Iraq since
it invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and has opposed the multinational force
defending Saudi Arabia.
   However, oil executives in the gulf say Yemen needs the revenues
from its refinery at Aden and cannot afford to run the risk of
drawing international sanctions for breaking the embargo aganist
Iraq.
   Yemen has been gripped by pro-Iraqi and anti-U.S. demonstrations
that included rock-throwing assaults on the American Embassy in the
first days of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, president since May in the merged state
formed of North and South Yemen, went to Washington early this year
to foster ties with the United States.

   About 200 Jordanian women carying banners
and singing patriotic songs marced on the U.S. Embassy today,
demanding the United States withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia and
lift the economic embargo on Iraq.
   The women, who marched from downtown Amman in blazing heat, were
stopped by police about 100 yards from the mission. For about an
hour, they blocked traffic on a main avenue nearby, chanted slogans
and sang songs.
   The women carried large cloth banners reading: ``Stop the
American blockade,'' and ``Jordanian Women Protest American
Intervention.''
   Other placards said: ``Mr. Bush don't stick your nose in Arab
affairs,'' and ``American mothers, why send your sons to die in the
Arabian desert?''
   Small children held up bunches of flowers and placards that
read: ``Remember the flower children _ make love, not war.''
   A statement delivered to the U.S. Embassy by a delegation of
women demanded the U.S. troops withdraw from Saudi Arabia, where
they are stationed to deter a possible Iraqi invasion of the
kingdom.
   They also demanded an end to the economic embargo of Iraq.
U.N.-imposed sanctions were imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait and subsequent annexation of the emirate.
   ``The United States is planning to plunge the region into World
War III and complete annihiliation,'' the statement said.
   Riot police wearing helmets and carrying shields and truncheons
remained seated in a truck opposite the embassy's main gate during
the demonstration.
   Such protests, an almost daily occurrence in Jordan, reflect the
predominantly pro-Iraqi feeling of Jordanians, half of whom are
either of Palestinian origin or from the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   In part because of the popular sentiment in favor of Iraq, King
Hussein has still not committed himself fully to upholding the U.N.
sanctions. Another consideration is that Jordan exports about 40
percent of its goods to Iraq.
   Consequently, Iraqi goods continue to pass through Joran's Red
Sea port of Aqaba, a hole in the international sanctions against
Iraq. President Bush has said he might have U.S. warships block
ships leaving and entering the port.

<HEAD>Purdue Researchers Find Portion of Hormone Linked to Alcoholism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Purdue University researchers
believe they have unlocked a key in the battle against alcoholism.
They have isolated a chunk of a hormone that makes the body feel
good after drinking alcohol.
   Graduate student Suchitra A. Krishnan studied rats who were
placed under stress and then allowed to drink alcohol. Under both
conditions, they produced the adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or ACTH.
   ``We think a fragment of the hormone is responsible for making
the rats want to drink alcohol after the stress is relieved, even
if they were low- or non-drinkers before. Apparently they learn to
drink to reproduce the good feeling,'' said Krishnan.
   Krishnan presented her findings Tuesday at the 21st Congress of
the International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology in Buffalo,
N.Y.
   Krishnan and pharmacy professor Roger P. Maickel said that if a
drug containing the same amino acids as the ``feel good'' section
of ACTH were given to alcoholics, it might satisfy their desire to
drink without alcohol's many bad side effects.
   In the study, Krishnan gauged the rats' alcohol consumption by
letting them drink from either of two bottles of sweetened water,
one containing 10 percent alcohol. Then the rats were divided into
two groups made up of low, moderate and heavy alcohol consumers.
   Krishnan caused stress among one group by closely confining them
for periods of time over several days. During the confinement the
animals all drank less alcohol than each one had before being
stressed. But after the stress ended they generally drank two to
three times more alcohol than before.
   A second group of rats was not stressed but was injected with a
piece of the ACTH molecule, called ACTH4-10, for several days. Most
drank no alcohol during that time, but several days after the
injections stopped they began drinking at twice to three times the
rate they had before.
   ``The ACTH4-10 acts like a reward mechanism to the rats,''
Krishnan said. ``For the most part, they didn't want to drink
alcohol at all during the injections because they were already
getting a substantial dose of the fragment.''

   NASA engineers today struggled to
restore radio contact with Magellan after losing touch with the
Venus-orbiting spacecraft for the second time in five days.
   Space agency engineers' failure this morning to hear from
Magellan after the link broke indicated the craft's computerized
emergency systems didn't immediately activate to help re-establish
communication with Earth, NASA said.
   So the engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory repeatedly
sent new computer commands toward Magellan's presumed position
around Venus in an attempt to tell it to radio Earth, said NASA
spokesman Bob MacMillin.
   Nothing was heard hours after the commands should have elicited
a response from Magellan. Engineers met to plan their next step.
   ``Bad news. Nothing. Not a peep out of it,'' MacMillin said.
``It's kind of a mystery.''
   Contact was lost at 7:03 p.m. Tuesday while NASA was tracking
Magellan with an antenna dish near Canberra, Australia, said
laboratory spokesman Jim Doyle.
   The latest blow to Magellan's $744 million mission to map Venus
came Tuesday night, less than eight hours after the space agency
released the craft's first snapshots of Venus.
   The pictures revealed a remarkably violent landscape shaped by
impact craters, quake faults, vast lava flows, and ridges and
valleys like those in the western United States.
   The loss of Magellan would be another major blow to NASA, which
grounded the space shuttle fleet temporarily because of fuel leaks
and found the Hubble Space Telescope was impaired by a flawed
mirror.
   The spacecraft's emergency systems allowed engineers to locate
the spacecraft on Friday, more than 14 hours after they lost
contact with it the first time. Eight hours later, they restored
steady contact by sending Magellan a command to stop spinning and
keep one of its antennas pointed at Earth.
   Magellan's mission is to map up to 90 percent of Venus' surface
using radar to peer through the planet's thick clouds, which
prevent the use of optical cameras. The spacecraft went into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10 after a roundabout, 948-million-mile trip.
It was launched from the shuttle Atlantis 15 months ago.
   When Magellan's first Venus pictures were released Tuesday,
Magellan project manager Tony Spear said that as far as engineers
could tell, ``the spacecraft is healthy,'' despite last week's
malfunction.
   He and other engineers said they still hadn't figured out the
cause of the problem. But Spear had been optimistic enough to say
he still planned to have Magellan start its Venus mapping mission
the first week of September.
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory is known for its ability to overcome
problems with wayward spacecraft. After the twin Voyager probes
were launched in 1977, one lost contact with Earth for eight days.
The radio link was restored and the probes went on to explore the
outer planets.
   Spacecraft system engineer John Slonski said one leading theory
to explain last week's loss of contact with Magellan was that a
cosmic ray or a high-energy particle from the sun caused a blip in
its computer memory.
   ``We're not ruling out a software flaw or some hardware
problem'' or perhaps some unknown electrical fields surrounding
Venus, Spear said.
   He also said cosmic ray ``hits'' on spacecraft electronics can
be expected to interfere with Magellan about once each year.
   Magellan made its first pictures of Venus during a test
conducted just before last week's malfunction.
   As promised by NASA, Magellan's first pictures are 10 times more
detailed than the best radar images of Venus made by two Soviet
probes and a giant radio telescope in Puerto Rico. They show
details as small as 400 feet across.
   The pictures show ``Venus is intensely fractured and faulted,''
with at least part of its terrain shaped by geological forces
``even more violent than I imagined before,'' Magellan project
scientist Steve Saunders said Tuesday.
   The pictures cover a small portion of the planet near
Hawaii-like volcanic highlands.
   The pictures show plains covered by six- to 10-mile-wide lava
flows that solidified and then were cracked by faults. Saunders
said the flows resemble those in Hawaii or along the Columbia and
Snake rivers in the Pacific Northwest.
   Also visible are a couple of volcanic cinder cones, a
20-mile-wide meteorite crater and long, parallel sets of two- to
three-mile-wide valleys and ridges that look like the basins and
ranges of Utah and Nevada, Saunders said.

<HEAD>France Sending Ground Troops; Turkey May Join Multinational Force</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   France was said to be sending its first ground forces to the
Persian Gulf today, and Iraq's neighbor Turkey said it was
considering joining the multinational force deployed to deter
further aggression by Baghdad.
   In Japan, debate was heating up over whether the country ought
to break with its longtime ban on deploying of military forces
overseas.
   On Tuesday Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy said they
were sending warships to the Persian Gulf region, and the
nine-member Western European Union, meeting in Paris, agreed to to
coordinate military action.
   In Paris, military sources said a reconnaissance squadron, the
first French ground forces being sent to the Persian Gulf, would
likely leave today for the United Arab Emirates. The sources said
the squadron is equipped with amphibious, anti-tank vehicles armed
with cannons and machine guns.
   The announcement by President Francois Mitterrand the deployment
of a squadron, about 180 men, signaled a toughening of the French
posture.
   ``We are in a war mindset ... from which it will be difficult to
emerge,'' Mitterrand told reporters Tuesday after a special Cabinet
session.
   He also said that French warships in the region could open fire,
with his approval, to enforce the U.N. embargo on Iraq. France has
dispatched eight vessels to the region with 3,800 men.
   Meanwhile, Turkey's defense minister, Safa Giray, said Turkey
might join the U.S.-led multinational force ``if our assessment
shows this would be to the benefit of our country.''
   Turkey has placed its air force in a state of readiness since
the outbreak of the crisis caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug.
2. But officials have denied reports of troop movements to Turkey's
southern region and of deployment of U.S. F-117 stealth fighters in
Turkish bases and partial mobilization.
   At the request of the United States, Ankara closed Iraqi oil
pipelines through Turkey and severed trade ties with Iraq.
   In Japan, the largest opposition party today urged the
government not to send personnel to the Middle East.
   In a meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Socialist Party
Chairwoman Takako Doi said the government should honor a law
allowing emergency personnel to be sent only to nations hit by
natural disasters, party officials said.
   Japan has joined other countries in imposing economic sanctions
against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, but has not contributed
personnel or financial support to the multinational forces
stationed in the region.
   In his meeting with Ms. Doi, Kaifu cited Japan's ``growing
responsibility'' in international affairs, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   Japan is more dependent on Middle East oil than any other
industrialized country and obtained 11.2 percent of its oil from
Iraq and Kuwait in the first quarter of the year.
   In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, defense ministers from the six-nation
Gulf Cooperation Council met today to discuss defense strategy.
   Abdullah Bishara, the general secretary of the alliance, told
Kuwaiti television before the meeting that the council has decided
to muster the troops of the Penisula Shield rapid deployment force.
   The force of up to 10,000 troops has been based for the last two
years at the northeastern Saudi base of Hafr Al-Baten.
   The bulk of the multinational military force has been deployed
by the United States, which is leading a huge buildup of ground,
air and sea forces in and around Saudi Arabia to defend it against
possible Iraqi aggression.
   The Pentagon has refused to disclose the precise number of
American troops in the region or on the way, but Gen. Hansford T.
Johnson, the top official responsible for getting troops and
supplies to Saudi Arabia, indicated it was 35,000. An additional
20,000 sailors are deployed on warships in the area.
   In addition to tens of thousands of American troops, there are
smaller numbers of soldiers from Egypt, Syria and Morocco. The
force also includes warships from the Western allies.
   Military officials have estimated that Iraq has up to 170,000
soldiers in Kuwait and hundreds of tanks and missiles.
   Meanwhile, Kuwait's ousted government pledged today to step up
its armed struggle against Iraqi invaders through guerrilla attacks
and conventional warfare.
   Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah told a news
conference in Cairo that Kuwaiti attacks on Iraqi occupation forces
would increase within days. Most of the world still considers the
al-Sabah family, led by Emir Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the
legitimate rulers of Kuwait.
   There have been reports of Kuwaiti guerrilla resistance since
the invasion, but they have not been confirmed independently.
   The reports included accounts of attacks by suicide vehicle
bombers and blowing up of Iraqi tanks and fuel trucks.
   In Iraq, the Baghdad Observer newspaper warned that any flareup
in the gulf will lead to all-out war.
   ``One should not expect the Iraqis to sit idle when their towns
and population centers are being bombarded by the U.S. planes and
shells.
   ``Iraqis will take the war into the cities of the attacking
nations if it is attacked,'' the state-controlled paper said.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is a ``destructive
loser'' whose hostage-taking reflects his isolation in the region
and the world, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was ``deeply upset''
by reports that Iraq soldiers continue to round up Britons at
gunpoint in Kuwait.
   ``Our nationals should be looked after very well indeed. It's a
scandal the way they are being treated,'' Mrs. Thatcher told
reporters.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 trapped 4,500 Britons in
Iraq and Kuwait. The Foreign Office said on Monday that 137 of the
British citizens are known to have been rounded up in Kuwait and
none in Iraq.
   The Foreign Office said today it has traced 97 of the Britons
held in Kuwait and that 76 of them are at civilian installations.
Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the
indication was that the other 21 Britons were held at military
installations. Foreign Office spokesmen were unavailable to
immediately comment on the situation of the 21.
   Hurd expressed satisfaction with decisions Tuesday by Greece and
Spain to join the international naval force in the Persian Gulf and
by the Western European Union to coordinate military action.
   He said he was also pleased that the European Community refused
to close embassies in Kuwait, as Iraq had ordered. Britain has
rejected the order to close its embassy, although the Foreign
Office said the staff would be reduced from the current 10 to a
core group of three or four diplomats.
   ``You see the pressures which are building up at our
instigation,'' Hurd said in an interview with BBC radio.
   ``I think this policy of Saddam Hussein's is a loser. It was
designed to weaken particularly European opionion. What happened
yesterday ... showed it has had the opposite effect. It's
strengthening.
   ``It portrays him instead of being a warrior, as being a worried
man sheltering behind women and children. And that I'm sure is bad
news for him.''
   Hurd said that Iraq's tactic of placing Western citizens in
harm's way to deter military attacks was a strategy of desperation
by a nation without any strong allies.
   ``This human shield policy is ... not going to work,'' Hurd said.
   If any of the hostages were harmed, he said, ``that of course
would create a new situation. We have never ruled out further
measures, neither we nor the Americans. The prime minister and I
have all been very clear that we do not rule out further measures
if the economic measures don't work.''
   Defense Secretary Tom King, appearing on BBC-TV, said the
hostages must not influence the policy of Britain and its allies.
   ``We have to take decisions in the interests of ending
aggression. We can't take hostages into account in this situation
or we run the risk that more hostages will be taken,'' he said.
   Hurd said he was encouraged the majority of Arab states have
supported the sanctions against Iraq and that some have contributed
military forces.
   ``The fact is that Saddam Hussein has kicked the Arabs in the
teeth,'' Hurd said.
   ``Anyone interested in the Arab-Israel dispute, anyone
interested in a settlement there, and a peace process there, that's
been put way on the back burner. By whom? By Saddam Hussein. He's a
loser, a destructive loser,'' Hurd said.

   The air force bombed and strafed
targets on the Jaffna Peninsula today in what military officials
called a new offensive against the northern stronghold of the Tamil
Tiger rebels.
   Planes dropped leaflets over the peninsula Tuesday announcing an
indefinite curfew and warning more than 850,000 civilians to stay
out of the line of fire, said the officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The curfew took effect at 6 a.m. local time today, and the
planes began bombing runs an hour later, the officials said.
   They said the aerial attacks were directed at ``identified
terrorist targets.'' The military was accused earlier this year of
indiscriminately bombing civilians in Jaffna.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne was quoted in a
government statement as telling foreign diplomats that the bombing
was carried out ``after careful intelligence assessment to minimize
any loss of civilian life.''
   The peninsula, 185 miles northeast of Colombo, is the
headquarters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main
guerrilla organization seeking an independent Tamil state in the
north and east of this Indian Ocean island.
   The Tigers broke a 13-month cease-fire on June 11 to re-open its
7-year-old campaign for independence from the Sinhalese-dominated
government.
   The Tigers have beseiged about 250 policemen and soldiers inside
Jaffna Fort since the fighting resumed in June. Three other camps,
including an airstrip, also are cut off by the insurgents.
   Officials in Colombo, the capital, said one man in the fort was
killed by sniper fire Tuesday.
   An offensive has been widely expected since July, when
government troops seized positions in several villages south of
Elephant Pass, which controls the causeway and the only road to the
peninsula.
   But the government's attention has focused on the east coast,
where the Tigers have been pushed out of the major towns. The east
also has been the scene of communal violence among the Tamil,
Sinhalese and Moslems in which hundreds of civilians have been
killed.
   At least 14,000 people have died since the civil war began in
1983 over Tamil claims of discrimination by the Sinhalese majority.
   The mainly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the
country's 16 million people, control the government and military.
Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, comprise 18 percent, while Moslems
account for 7 percent.

<HEAD>Police Say Robbery Involved in Slaying of Three Store Employees</HEAD>

   Robbery was the motive in the killings of
three automotive parts store employees shot at point-blank range,
investigators say.
   Police were looking today for the killer or killers who tied up
the Super Shops employees when the store closed Sunday evening.
   Super Shops President Gregg Koechlein would not say Tuesday how
much cash was stolen from the store. ``But it's so inconsequential
an amount to think that three people were killed for this. It
shocks the conscience,'' he said.
   Other company officials said the day's cash receipts probably
did not exceed several thousand dollars.
   ``Even if you get a million dollars, is it worth executing three
people? This is just a vicious, cold-blooded killing _ there's no
other way to describe it,'' said city police Lt. Houston Williams.
   The victims were identified as assistant manager Darrell Esgar,
22, of Huntington Beach, and salesmen Chad Chadwick, 22, of Orange
and Russell Williams, 21, of Seal Beach.

   Rival Xhosas and Zulus battled
with guns, axes and spears today, killing at least 39 people
despite peace calls to end violence that has claimed at least 478
lives in 10 days.
   Police and witnesses said gangs of Zulus and Xhosas clashed
early today at a sprawling migrant workers hostel at Vosloorus, a
township east of Johannesburg. Scores of armed Xhosas stormed the
complex, grappling with Zulus in hand-to-hand fighting as the
hostels were set on fire.
   ``It was awful. The bodies had been castrated. There were lots
of burnt bodies,'' a local journalist said. ``Everyone was in
shock.''
   Police said at least 39 people were killed in Vosloorus.
   After dawn, police moved in and fired tear gas to break up the
fighting. Bodies were put in small piles for collection.
   Witnesses said many of the bodies also had been ritually
mutilated. They said police vehicles were attacked in Vosloorus.
   Overnight fighting in Kagiso township west of Johannesburg
killed 20 people, police said. Xhosas fighting Zulus living in a
migrant workers hostel set up burning barricades in streets to try
to prevent attacks, witnesses said.
   Maxwell Mulovhedzi, a security guard, said fighting erupted in
Kagiso when armed Zulus from the hostel attacked passersby.
   ``They attacked an old man with an axe and killed him,'' he
said. ``After a while they attacked another two people, killing
them both.''
   In other township violence:
   _A 13-month baby was burned to death in a house that was
firebombed Tuesday night in Kwathema, according to news reports.
   _A white security guard working for a private company was shot
and killed in Soweto late Tuesday and his shotgun taken, police
said.
   _A black police officer was killed and another officer
critically injured today when two black men hurled a Soviet-made
grenade into their vehicle in Soweto, according to South African
Press Association.
   _Armed blacks also hurled firebombs at police armored vehicles
and shots were fired at police patrols in Kagiso, police said.
   ``Blacks threw stones and petrol bombs at police. In two cases
they fired shots at police, who fired tear gas and then birdshot in
retaliation,'' said a police spokesman, Lt. Ida van Zweel.
   Today's violence raised the death toll for the last 10 days to
at least 478, with hundreds injured, police said. More bodies were
found in other black townships, they said, and the toll was
expected to increase.
   The fighting erupted Aug. 12 between Zulus of the conservative
Inkatha movement and Xhosas, tied to the African National Congress.
   The latest clashes came after government and black leaders
Tuesday called for peace and an end to the fighting. Government
officials also said they hoped the ANC, which did not take part in
the talks, would now join peace efforts.
   But senior ANC leaders declined to comment. ANC leader Nelson
Mandela has refused to meet with Inkatha leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   In talks Tuesday in Pretoria, President F.W. de Klerk conferred
in Pretoria separately with Buthelezi and Gen. Bantu Holomisa, head
of the Xhosa homeland of Transkei, to try to end the bloodshed.
   ``Not only must the bloodshed cease, the war of words must
cease,'' the government and black leaders said in a joint statement
later. ``This has often been interpreted at grassroots level as
license for violence.''
   The South African Youth Congress today accused police of aiding
Inkatha fighters in the township clashes. The congress is an
ANC-affiliated youth organization that is generally more militant
than the parent group.
   Holomisa made a similar charge on Tuesday after meeting with de
Klerk and other government leaders.
   Police and government leaders have repeatedly denied such
charges.
   Holomisa leads a nominally independent homeland in the southeast
part of the country far away from the fighting. He is an ally of
the ANC, the largest black opposition movement, but he has no real
influence outside his region.
   Buthelezi's supporters have been locked in a struggle with the
ANC in Natal Province for the past five year in a contest that has
claimed some 5,000 lives.

notified.
   Five people were riding in one car, four were in the other.

<HEAD>OPEC Nations Consider Holding Informal Weekend Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six OPEC nations are considering
holding an informal meeting this weekend to discuss the turmoil in
the oil markets caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, sources close to
the cartel said today.
   Oil prices edged higher in London on crisis jitters today. North
Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was valued at $27.90 a
barrel at midday, up from Tuesday's $27.10.
   In late-morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
October contract for West Texas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade
of U.S. crude _ was up 64 cents to $29.35 a 42-gallon barrel. The
September contract for unleaded gasoline gained 1.74 cents to $1.03
a gallon, while home heating oil shot up 3.79 cents to 87.50 cents
a gallon.
   Meanwhile, some tankers were being reflagged to avoid economic
sanctions against Iraq. The Spanish oil company Compania Espanola
de Petroleo SA said it planned to transfer 126,000 tons of Nigerian
crude oil from a barred Iraqi-flagged tanker to another ship to
allow the oil to be imported to a Canary Island refinery.
   The Spanish merchant marine had barred the Iraqi-flagged
Almuntanabbi from Spanish ports Monday, but a merchant marine
spokesman said today the deparment agreed to the transfer of the
Nigerian crude to a ``neutral'' ship.
   The Kuwaiti-flagged Triden Arrow, blocked Saturday by Spain from
unloading 1,000 tons of Brazilian cotton in Barcelona, switched to
the Liberian flag Tuesday and was permitted to unload.
   Regarding OPEC plans, Indonesia has suggested that six of the 13
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gather
in Vienna on Sunday to examine the situation, according to the
sources, who demanded anonymity.
   The sources stressed that no final decision has yet been made on
whether to meet.
   ``It may or may not be held,'' said one source. ``If it is, it
will be very, very informal.'' No decisions could be made at the
gathering, he said.
   The idea of the consultations is apparently an attempt at a
compromise between those countries which want an emergency meeting
of all the cartel's members and those which do not.
   On Monday, OPEC announced that there was no majority support for
a Saudi Arabian request to call an urgent meeting.
   The kingdom's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said last Saturday
that his country intended to increase oil production by 2 million
barrels a day with or without OPEC's approval. Higher Saudi pumping
would make up about half of the loss of some 4 million barrels a
day caused by the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil
that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Nazer had urged the cartel to hold an emergency session to
discuss the situation. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Venezuela
and Ecuador were said to support his plea.
   Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, said he opposed an
emergency meeting because there was enough crude in storage to make
up for the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.
   Under the Indonesia proposal, the sources said Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia and Venezuela would gather for
the informal talks.
   Those nations represent two committees recently set up by the
cartel to monitor oil production and include Algeria, which holds
the cartel's presidency, and Indonesia, which is the alternate
president.
   In its statement on Monday, OPEC said Algerian Mining Minister
Sadek Boussena, the cartel's president, would hold consultations
with some ministers before the end of the month. It did not
elaborate.
   Saudi Arabia, which pumps about a quarter of the cartel's oil,
has an OPEC-set production quota of just under 5.4 million barrels
a day.
   At their summer conference last month, OPEC ministers agreed to
limit their output to 22.5 million barrels a day in the last half
of the year to try to push crude prices up to $21 a barrel.
   With the gulf crisis, the average price of a basket of crudes
monitored by the group surged last week to $25.29 a barrel.
   The next formal meeting of the organization is not scheduled
until mid-December.

   A former top aide to Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh pleaded innocent today to drug-related charges.
   Henry Barr, 47, a former Justice Department lawyer, was indicted
earlier this month by a federal grand jury in Harrisburg. He is
charged with two counts of lying to federal officials about drug
use, and one count each of cocaine possession and conspiracy.
   Barr, who lives in suburban Harrisburg, first worked with
Thornburgh during the 1970s when Thornburgh was a federal
prosecutor in Pittsburgh. He followed Thornburgh to the Justice
Department in 1988 and left in May 1989.
   The indictment accuses Barr of using cocaine at a suburban
Harrisburg home on April 8, 1989. It also alleges he lied about
drug use on a federal form the FBI uses to check the background of
people in sensitive jobs and repeated the lie in an interview with
federal agents.
   If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 12 years in a
jail and fines of $510,000.
   Barr would not answer reporters' questions before or after his
brief appearance today in U.S. District Court. His indictment stems
from an investigation that has resulted in guilty pleas from two
former deputy state prosectors.

   Here is the statement issued today by State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher on the situation in Kuwait:
   Consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 662,
the government of the United States, along with most other nations
represented in Kuwait, has rejected the Iraqi demand for the
closure of diplomatic missions in Kuwait and will be retaining a
diplomatic presence in that country. Ambassador Howell will remain
in charge.
   This is consistent not only with Security Council resolutions,
but also with our obligations to the American private community
who, along with other foreign nationals, have been deprived of the
freedom to leave and return to their home countries.
   We will continue to insist that the Iraqi occupation authorities
accept responsibility for the protection of American citizens and
accord them their basic rights.
   We will also insist that American diplomats in Kuwait continue
to receive the full protection which their status accords them
under international law.
   American citizens should be assured that we plan to have
sufficient diplomatic staff at the embassy in Kuwait to look after
their safety and welfare, which remains our highest priority. They
will serve our community to the best of their ability.
   Citizens should also know that the United States government will
continue to work with others to insist on the full implementation
of U.N. Security Council Resolution 664, which demands that Iraq
permit and facilitate the departure of all foreigners from Kuwait
and Iraq, as well as immediate and continuing consular access to
foreign nationals.

   Here is the full text of the State Department
message for U.S. citizens in Kuwait that was broadcast today over
the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corp.:
   The U.S. State Department, like most other embassies in Kuwait,
today announced that it would not close its embassy in Kuwait as
demanded by the Iraqi government.
   All essential embassy personnel will remain in Kuwait for the
express purpose of serving American citizens detained in Kuwait.
   The Iraqi government has from the beginning of this situation
stated that diplomats are free to leave Kuwait. We are taking them
at their word and have ordered the departure of all dependents and
staff that do not have a mission in Kuwait at this time.
   The United States government wants American citizens to be
assured that your welfare is foremost in our thoughts. We are
determined to continue working for your release from Kuwait and
your safe return to your families.
   We advise you to stay in close contact with the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait, to stay in your homes and to keep a low profile.
   Anyone thinking about an overland journey out of Kuwait should
plan their route carefully and be aware that Iraqi forces are under
orders to stop and take into custody anyone identified as an
American citizen.
   We advise Americans who are considering crossing the desert
there is a confirmed report that at least one person has died
attempting to cross.
   There are also unconfirmed rumors that others may have died
attempting this route.
   While there have been individuals who have been able to cross
the border without incident in recent days, there can be no
guarantee for the safety of those attempting to cross.

<HEAD>PUSH Fails To Win Support from Portland Black Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operation PUSH has failed to win support from
black leaders in Portland, Ore., after two days of protests and
meetings on its boycott of Oregon-based Nike Inc.
   ``PUSH wasn't happy it could not rally local support,'' Robert
Phillips, president of the Portland NAACP, said Tuesday.
   Leaders of the Portland branches of the NAACP, the Black United
Front, the Urban League and the Coalition of Black Men met Monday
with PUSH Executive Director Tyrone Crider. Joining Crider were
Chicago Alderman Dorothy Tillman and other activists who flew to
Oregon to garner support for the boycott.
   About 150 people attended a rally Monday night. About 40 of them
were PUSH supporters from Chicago, and several Portland residents
said they had come more out of curiosity than sympathy with the
boycott.
   Black community leaders in the Portland area said the boycott is
ill-conceived and lacks leadership. They expressed anger that
Chicago-based PUSH ignored them before forging ahead with its war
against Nike, the nation's largest athletic shoe maker.
   PUSH called for the boycott two weeks ago, saying Nike denies
blacks adequate employment and business opportunities. Nike, based
in suburban Beaverton, says its policies and programs for
minorities could be models for the industry.
   PUSH, which originally stood for People United to Save Humanity,
was founded by Jesse Jackson. He gave up direct leadership of the
organization to run for president in 1984 and more recently has
left its board.

   The five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council met today to try to draft a resolution calling for
a military blockade to enforce international economic sanctions
against Iraq.
   The Soviet Union has slowed U.S. efforts to get U.N. approval
for a military blockade, Western diplomats say, and the private
meeting today was expected to discuss Soviet concerns.
   The diplomats said Tuesday that Moscow has sought clear and
demonstrable failure of the U.N. embargo before approving any U.N.
military force.
   China had dragged its feet for the same reason, but a Kuwaiti
official in Beijing said today the Chinese government promised not
to block such a move.
   The meeting was held at the French Mission and involved
representatives from the United States, Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France.
   On his way into the meeting, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering
said, ``We'll be continuing our consultations in the day, pushing
toward hopefully trying to do something today, if its at all
possible.''
   Asked if the Soviets were blocking progress, Pickering replied:
``Well, I don't put my finger on anybody, we'll wait and see.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in an
interview published Tuesday that some elements of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's proposal to end the Middle East crisis ``merit
serious attention.''
   Saddam offered on Sunday to free thousands of foreign hostages
in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait if the U.S.-led multinational
force protecting Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression withdraws and
the United States guarantees the U.N. embargo on Iraq will be
lifted.
   ``I think that there are elements which attract attention,''
Shevardnadze was quoted as telling the Soviet newspaper Pravda.
``We are studying all the details, all the blocks of the speech of
the president of Iraq.''
   The Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Soviet and Chinese objections have slowed the momentum for
tougher measures following the near-unanimity of the Security
Council in four previous votes against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   The permanent Security Council members deliberated a
precedent-setting proposal Tuesday that would authorize foreign
naval vessels to use minimum force in policing the U.N. embargo. No
final action was taken. Any of the five permanent council members
can kill council resolutions with a veto.
   The Soviets in the past week have wanted to revive the Military
Staff Committee before imposing a blockade. The committee consists
of military officers of the five permanent officers to coordinate
U.N. enforcement actions, but it has never had an active role, even
during the 1950-53 Korean War.
   Soviet Ambassador Valentin Lozinsky last week told Security
Council that the Soviets would participate in a blockade only under
a U.N. flag.
   For the second day in a row, Shevardnadze met in Moscow Tuesday
with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Saadoun Hammadi, but the Soviet
news agency Tass gave few details of their talks. Hammadi also
spoke with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who urged Iraq to
allow foreigners to leave its territory.
   
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed, said in Beijing
today that China has promised not to veto military enforcement of
the U.N. embargo. He met this morning with Premier Li Peng and
Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian, but the Kuwaiti official did not say
from whom he extracted the promise.
   Chinese Ambassador Li Daoyu, in the first public statement about
the Beijing government's stand, said Tuesday that Security Council
decisions ``thus far imply no permission for military involvement
by big powers and their naval blockade.
   ``Under the present circumstances,'' he told the Xinhua news
agency, ``resort to military actions will lead to further
aggravation of the situation and escalation of the armed conflict,
which does not help solving the problem.''
   He urged that efforts be channeled through the Security
Council's sanctions committee before military action was authorized.
   Li did not say how China would vote on military involvement, but
diplomats said China was likely to abstain and not cast a lone
veto. All five permanent council members have veto power and can
kill any resolution.
   The United States, Britain and France were supportive of a
unique resolution which would provide a U.N. umbrella, but not a
U.N. flag and command, for international warships enforcing the
embargo. Britain's U.N. ambassador argued that such a possible
``momentous step'' requires that all nations move ``extremely
carefully.''
   In a display of unprecedented cooperation, the 15-member
Security Council has adopted four mandatory resolutions in the past
three weeks: Condemning Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait; calling
for sweeping economic sanctions against Iraq; rejecting Iraq's
``annexation'' of Kuwait and demanding freedom for thousands of
foreigners held against their will in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Under Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, the Security Council may
call for a blockade and enforcement of its embargo through military
force, if its earlier sanctions have been violated. Article 42
never has been invoked for a U.N. enforcement action.

   Military experts sent to Iraq before its invasion
of Kuwait continue working for the Iraqi government, despite a
Kremlin order to sever all trade and financial ties with Baghdad, a
Soviet colonel said today.
   The 193 Soviet experts have been training Iraqi soldiers to use
Soviet-built weapons, repairing and maintaining those weapons, and
building test ranges, Col. Valentin Ogurtsov told a news briefing.
   ``They are fulfilling their contractual duties,'' he said.
   Soviet experts are not involved in military operations and did
not provide advice for Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, he said.
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov issued an order to all
Soviet agencies earlier today to cut business ties with Iraq to
comply with U.N. sanctions, the Tass news agency reported.
   The Soviet Union had been Iraq's main arms supplier, providing
most of its modern tanks, missiles and jet fighters.
   But the day after the Iraqi invasion, the Soviet Union cut arms
supplies to Baghdad, and Ogurtsov said one weapons shipment was
stopped in transit. Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III signed a joint statement
condemning Iraq's attack on its oil-rich neighbor.
   But the Soviet Union, together with China, has slowed U.S.
efforts at the United Nations for military action to back up the
economic embargo of Iraq, Western diplomats say.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh rejected repeated
questions about whether the continuing work by the military experts
violated the U.N. emgargo and the Soviet government order.
   He said nationals from other countries continued to work in
Iraq, although he did not identify the nations or jobs their
nationals were performing.
   Iraq has made hostages out of thousands of foreigners who were
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the invasion. Iraq has also moved
some foreigners to Iraqi military installations to prevent an
attack by a U.S.-led multinational force being deployed in Saudi
Arabia to protect it against Iraqi aggression.
   ``This is not a simple solution,'' Gremitskikh said. ``Don't
single out the Soviet Union. ... I don't think this presence runs
counter to the United Nations position.''
   Ogurtsov said that when the Soviet government contracted to sell
weapons to Iraq, it also agreed to provide technical experts to
show Iraq how to use them.
   Gremitskikh said when the contracts expire, the experts will
leave and will not be replaced. The contracts range from 10 days to
one year, Ogurtsov said.
   ``At the present time, they work not only in training centers
but on test ranges. Suppose we supplied a new type of tank. It has
new unknown capabilities to the local personnel so we build a kind
of test range to test it. ... This is the kind of activity they are
involved in,'' Ogurtsov said.
   ``We are trying to make the period of stay shorter and shorter
but we are going to phase out the work eventually,'' Ogurtsov said.
   The military experts were among 7,791 Soviets stranded in Iraq
after its attack on Kuwait. Gremitskikh said Soviet women and
children would begin to be evacuated from Iraq on Sunday. He
indicated that Iraq would then allow Soviet men to be evacuated.
   Also today, a special envoy from Saudi Arabia arrived in Moscow.
The Soviet Union has no diplomatic relations with the kingdom,
Gremitskikh said. Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Saadoun Hammadi met
with Shevardnadze Monday and Tuesday.
   Saudi Arabia and Moscow had full diplomatic relations until
1938, when dictator Josef Stalin closed his embassy in Jiddah to
cut costs.
   Several attempts to re-establish ties during the 1980s faltered
over what Saudia Arabia called the Soviet Union's ``belligerent
attitude'' toward its 50 million Moslems.

<TEXT>
   The city's new police chief has two unresolved
departmental charges against him, according to a Georgia Bureau of
Investigation report.
   Atlanta Police Department records on Eldrin A. Bell show the
department's internal affairs unit recommended charges against him
in 1989 for allegedly operating a security business in the city _ a
conflict of interest _ and doing it without departmental permission.
   The records were contained in the GBI report given to Mayor
Maynard Jackson prior to Bell's nomination for police chief, which
the Atlanta City Council approved Monday.
   Bell refused to speak with reporters Tuesday and denied there
were open charges against him. He also has maintained he no longer
has an interest in a security business.
   The mayor, who said Monday the GBI report contained nothing new,
first said Tuesday there were no open charges, but later criticized
former Chief Morris G. Redding for not resolving the open charges
before retiring last month.
   ``The first time I found out the former chief did not do his
duty was over the past few days,'' said Jackson, who has asked
acting City Attorney Joe Harris to look into the matter.
   The charges allege Bell, who will oversee a force of 1,590
officers, operated a security business based in the zone he
commanded in 1988 and that he hired off-duty zone officers to work
for his firm, Taking Care of Business Inc.
   The allegations against Bell were made by the International
Brotherhood of Police Officers union.
   Deputy Chief W.J. Taylor, who was acting chief and a finalist
for the job, said he was aware of the unresolved charges against
Bell, but did not act.
   ``I thought it inappropriate to adjudicate disciplinary action
against another candidate,'' he said.
   He said the file was still sitting on the desk where Redding
left it when he retired. ``I didn't read the file,'' he said.
   ``I had decided not to make a decision until the new chief is
appointed. I wanted to remain neutral,'' Redding said in a July GBI
interview.
   He added that if the charges were upheld, Bell could have faced
a maximum one- or two-day suspension.

   The United States pledged today to defy Iraqi orders to close
down its embassy in conquered Kuwait, and cracks appeared in what
had been unprecedented U.S.-Soviet unity in the 3-week-old Persian
Gulf crisis.
   In the gulf, the military buildup intensified.
   President Bush today ordered military reserves to active duty,
and the U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga today steamed through
Egypt's Suez Canal toward the Red Sea to join a growing American
flotilla, a canal spokesman said.
   In Moscow, a Soviet official disclosed today that military
experts sent to Iraq before its invasion of Kuwait continue to work
for the Iraqi government despite a Kremlin pledge to go along with
sanctions aimed at isolating Iraq.
   Col. Valentin Ogurtsov said the 193 Soviet experts have been
training Iraqi soldiers to use Soviet-built weapons, repairing and
maintaining those weapons, and building test ranges. But he said
the advisers were not involved in military operations and did not
provide advice on the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The Soviets were also slowing U.S. efforts to get U.N. approval
for a military blockade, Western diplomats said. The diplomats said
Tuesday that Moscow has sought clear and demonstrable failure of
the U.N. embargo before approving any U.N. military force.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council met
today to discuss a proposal to enforce the embargo. U.S. and other
warships already have been shadowing Iraqi vessels.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, on his way into the meeting
in New York, declined to specifically blame the Soviets for
foot-dragging, but said he hoped for action on the matter today.
   Western nations today renewed angry protests over the roundup of
foreigners trapped in the wake of the invasion. Denmark warned Iraq
could be trying to split the West by selective hostage-holding.
   In Washington, the State Department today announced the U.S.
intention to defy Saddam's demand to close the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait by Friday, but said it would reduce the staff. Other
nations, including Britain, have announced plans to do the same.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the decision was
consistent with ``our obligations to the American private
community'' of about 2,500 people in Kuwait. An estimated 500
Americans are trapped in Iraq.
   Pope John Paul II, in his first public comment on the crisis,
today pointed to the ``the danger of war'' and offered a prayer for
peace. A day earlier, the pontiff met with the Vatican envoy to
both Iraq and Kuwait to discuss the situation, and papal spokesman
Joaquin Navarro said the diplomat is ready to pursue any
humanitarian initiatives if asked.
   Meanwhile, an Iraqi tanker that had defied warning shots from an
American warship, reached Yemen's port of Aden today and dropped
anchor near two other Iraqi ships already docked there. Yemen had
told the U.N. Security Council that it would adhere to the
sanctions against Iraq.
   Yemeni officials would not comment on the tanker's presence
today. But the official Yemeni news agency quoted an unidentified
Foreign Ministry official on Tuesday as saying Yemen did not intend
to ``intercept or obstruct'' any ships.
   With no sign of letup in the crisis, the Tokyo stock market
tumbled today. Oil prices edged higher in London on crisis jitters
today, and were also up in late-morning trade on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   In diplomatic activity on the crisis, Saudi Prince Bandar bin
Sultan arrived in the Soviet Union, the official Soviet news agency
Tass said. Also, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak conferred today
with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama on the gulf crisis,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
   Also today, defense ministers from the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council met today in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a
unified defense strategy to complement the U.S.-led military
buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   Abdullah Bishara, the general secretary of the gulf alliance,
told Kuwaiti television before the meeting that the council has
decided to muster the troops of the Penisula Shield rapid
deployment force. The force of up to 10,000 troops from six gulf
nations has been based for the last two years at the northeastern
Saudi base of Hafr Al-Baten.
   Arab League foreign ministers were to meet in emergency session
on Monday, but an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said the
gathering had been rescheduled for Aug. 30. He did not say how many
nations had agreed to attend.
   Baghdad has expressed willingness to negotiate with the United
States, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the
offer Tuesday as the ``same old litany from Iraq.'' He said no
talks are possible until Iraq withdraws its tens of thousands of
troops from Kuwait.
   In a speech directed at Bush, Saddam defended detaining
foreigners and promised ``a major catastrophe'' if fighting breaks
out.
   Of the 3,000 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the
invasion, 54 are believed to have been seized by Iraqi authorities,
the State Department said Tuesday. Iraq says it is using some as
human shields at military installations.
   The British Foreign Office said today that 21 Britons are known
to be held at Iraqi military installations. British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd denounced Saddam today as a ``destructive
loser'' whose hostage-taking reflects his isolation in the region
and the world.
   Iraq's reported willingness to release European Community
citizens from Kuwait could be an attempt to split the Western
countries, Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen cautioned
today.
   That was underscored by an Iraqi newspaper's warning today to
Europe and Japan, telling them their own interests would be harmed
if they ``walk in the steps of Washington.''
   The state-run Al-Gomhuriya warned France, Italy, West Germany
and Japan not to participate in what it termed ``American
occupation of the gulf oilfields.''
   U.S. forces in the gulf, meanwhile, continued to grow.
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga and the guided missile
cruisers Biddle and Philippine Sea sailed through Egypt's Suez
Canal today en route from the Mediterranean to the gulf region,
said canal officials.
   The Saratoga joins the carriers Eisenhower in the Red Sea and
the Independence, stationed in the Arabian Sea just outside the
Persian Gulf. A fourth aircraft carrier, the Kennedy, is enroute to
the Mediterranean.
   More than 25 U.S. warships are in the region. Britain, France
and the Soviet Union also have warships in the area. Belgium and
Australia have vessels on the way.
   French military sources said today a reconnaissance squadron,
the first French ground forces being sent to the area, would likely
leave today for the United Arab Emirates.
   U.S. Air Force Gen. Hansford T. Johnson estimated Tuesday that
at least 35,000 American military personnel are either in or en
route to the kingdom. In addition 20,000 sailors are aboard U.S.
ships deployed in the region.
   Iraq, meanwhile, has moved surface-to-surface Scud missiles into
occupied Kuwait, increasing the threat of a chemical weapons
attack, Brig. Gen. Turki Bin Nassar, a Saudi base commander, told
reporters in the kingdom on Tuesday.
   But he said that U.S. and Saudi forces have defenses against the
Scuds, including U.S. Patriot anti-ballistic missiles in place in
Saudi Arabia.
   Also, Tass quoted Kuwaiti officials as saying Iraq has mined all
important government installations in Kuwait, including oil
refineries, power plants, sea ports and water distilleries.
   However, British intelligence sources in Saudi Arabia said Iraqi
forces must steal water, food and fuel to survive. They also said
the Iraqi threat of chemical warfare is not as great as first
feared.

<HEAD>King Hussein Says Processing Of Refugees May Be Slowed By Heavy
Exodus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hussein said today his country is
heavily burdened by thousands of refugees fleeing Kuwait and may
have to ``slow down the process'' of receiving them.
   ``On the human level we have some serious problems,'' he told
reporters at a nationally televised news conference.
   ``We have received within Jordan since the beginning of this
crisis an approximate number of 185,000 people of different
nationalities.''
   Of the nearly 120,000 refugees who remain in Jordan, he said:
``We are finding enormous difficulty in meeting the needs of these
people or in arranging adequate modes of transport for them to
leave Jordan.''
   Many Egyptians, Palestinians and other mostly Arab refugees
fleeing Kuwait since the Aug. 2 invasion by Iraq have entered
Jordan.
   Only a few of the thousands of Westerners trapped in Iraq and
Kuwait, including about 3,000 Americans, have been able to flee to
safety. The rest are being held as hostages by Iraq.
   ``We may have to slow down the process of receiving more people
unless we can speed up the movement of people to their respective
destinations,'' Hussein said. ``We are trying our very best to
provide food and shelter and medical facitilities.''
   Hussein also said he would continue efforts to help bring a
peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf crisis, saying any escalation
``would have a devastating effect on this region and the world.''
   ``I am in touch with leaders throughout the world, and we will
continue to do our utmost to contribute to the solution of the
crisis to the best of our ability,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Orders Military Reserves to Active Duty</HEAD>

call-up; raises Bush quote; no pickup</NOTE>

   President Bush today ordered
military reserves to active duty, signing an executive order that
calls an unspecified number of reservists to bolster the U.S.
military effort in the Persian Gulf.
   The order did not give a number of reservists involved in the
call-up, but Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We do not
anticipate approaching the full 200,000 authority provided by law.''
   ``I hereby determine that it is necessary to augment the active
armed forces of the United States for the effective conduct of
operational missions in and around the Arabian Peninsula,'' Bush's
executive order said.
   Bush sent letters to the speaker of the House and the president
of the Senate to inform them of the action, telling them his order
empowers Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to designate the
reservists to perform missions he ``may determine necessary.''
   An administration official said the Pentagon expects to call up
40,000 reservists ``between now and the end of August.''
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, was asked if
more could be ordered to duty later. ``We'll have to see,'' the
official said. ``Forty thousand is initially what we're looking
at.''
   The call-up will focus on personnel who can fill the jobs of
active duty forces on duty in the Gulf in such areas as cargo
handling, airlift, food and water handling, surface transportation,
medical services, construction and intelligence, Fitzwater said in
a statement.
   While taking reservists from their normal jobs may be
disruptive, the Pentagon told reporters, ``What must be emphasized
is that those who have been ordered to active duty are vital to our
national commitment in this operation.''
   Announcement of the call-up came shortly before Bush met here
with Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcraft and Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   It was the first time the president has activated the reserves
since March 1970, when the reserves were called up during a postal
strike.
   Presidents have called up the reserves 10 times since World War
II.
   The 26,273 reservists called up by President Nixon in 1970
helped deliver the mail during the postal strike. The last
mobilization of reserves for a hostile action occurred from January
1968 to December 1969 when President Johnson called up more than
35,000 reservists to help with the Vietnam War.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said this would be a
``very surgical, specialized call-up'' of personnel in specific
jobs, rather than a broad call-up.
   Meanwhile, the administration decided today to reduce the staff
of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait but to keep it open despite a demand
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The State Department announced the U.S. intention to defy
Saddam's demand to close the embassy by Friday. Spokesman Richard
Boucher said the decision was consistent with U.N. Security Council
resolutions and ``also with our obligations to the American private
community.''
   Bush summoned his top defense advisers to Kennebunkport to get
an update on the gulf situation. Cheney and Powell were expected to
report that the United States is approaching a target of 100,000
military personnel in the region, said one source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Officials have declined to give specific figures. But the Air
Force general in charge of transporting troops to Saudi Arabia,
Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, indicated Tuesday that at least 35,000
U.S. troops are there or en route. Another estimated 20,000 U.S.
troops are at sea in the area.
   The Pentagon has said that reservists subject to the call-up
will serve with their units, but once they report for duty, some
could be transferred to other locations.
   The rationale for the call-up, the Pentagon said last week, was
that ``the airlift, sealift, and support requirements for this
operation are enormous.''
   ``All-volunteer reservists are well aware of their missions and
train intensively, often with the active force, to be ready,''
according to the Pentagon.
   Cheney arrived in Washington late Tuesday after a four-day tour
of five Persian Gulf states.
   He met Tuesday with Saudi officials to share military
intelligence and discuss the possible sale of additional F-15
fighters and heavy tanks to bolster the kingdom's defenses. The
Saudis are hosting the massive buildup of U.S. forces and equipment
as Iraq moves missiles into Kuwait within target range of many
Saudi cities.
   Officials claim a successful trip for Cheney, whose meetings
with the leaders of Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and
Qatar were intended to seek support for the U.S.-led military
operation.
   The defense secretary said the Bush administration also favors
increasing aid to Egypt.
   Fitzwater told reporters Tuesday ``the world is united'' in
demanding unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's army from Kuwait.
   Speaking at a Falmouth, Maine, golf tournament where Bush was
playing, Fitzwater shot down Iraq's televised offer Tuesday to
conduct talks, saying the administration considered it ``the same
rhetoric that we've heard before.''
   Western nations are willing to talk to Iraqi officials about the
welfare of their citizens held in Iraq and Kuwait, he said, ``but
that's not the same as negotiations over a (United Nations) demand
to get out.''
   In addition to freedom for the Westerners, ``We demand complete
and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. That is the position of
the United Nations and that's the position of all nations,''
Fitzwater said.

   Italian politician and porn star
Illona Staller, better known as La Cicciolina, has offered to have
sex with Saddam Hussein if he agrees to free foreigners he is
holding in Iraq.
   ``I am willing to go to bed with Hussein if in exchange he sets
free the hostages, because this way it would be making love, not
war,'' Ms. Staller said Tuesday night. ``I am willing to let him
have his way with me if in exchange he frees the hostages.''
   Ms. Staller, 35, who represents the Radical Party in the Italian
parliament, arrived in this South American capital Monday for a
series of TV and nightclub appearances.
   During an appearance on Channel 9, Ms. Staller attributed the
Middle East conflict to ``the selfishness of the great powers and
the booty they all want to split after the conflict.''
   ``This is taking place because of oil, and that's why I support
the development of solar energy,'' she said. ``The sun can't be
divided between the United States and the East. The sun shines on
everyone equally.''

   Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on the Persian Gulf:
   If the United States expects to hold the respect of its fellow
members in the United Nations, it ought to abide by embargo rules
against Iraq and Kuwait.
   And if Uncle Sam wants broad cooperation in the U.N. sanctions,
he will accept the U.N. Security Council's guidance and restrain
himself from military action on his own. The Bush administration
thinks it has the authority to maneuver mighty U.S. naval ships
into the way of food and commodity ships bound for Iraq, and oil
ships on their way out. It doesn't. ...
   Nothing is gained for the Bush administration to step outside
the bounds of the body it's trying to rally into joint action
against Iraq. Sanctions against Iraq and tiny Kuwait, which Iraq
forcibly seized, could become particularly potent if they're given
time to work. ...
   The sanctions are vital and eventually should coerce Iraq into
negotiating, but sanctions compliance can't involve warships and
gunfire unless the Security Council decides the boycott isn't being
honored. Let's stick to the rules.

   Houston Chronicle on the Persian Gulf:
   If George Bush and Saddam Hussein were eyeball to eyeball,
Saddam blinked sometime on Aug. 7.
   Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk's classic characterization
of a confrontation seems only too appropriate to the touch-and-go
moment when Saddam first started backing down.
   Other Arabs, true to Middle East tradition, seemed the first to
sense it.
   Saddam blinked when he failed to move against Saudi Arabia in
that short period when he knew American forces were coming but
hadn't gotten there yet. It was the time when he could have had his
maximum leverage, taking the ground and forcing the Americans to
fight their way in _ if they wanted to in those dramatically
changed circumstances.
   It is no coincidence that most of the other Arab states not
directly involved moved against Saddam as soon as they saw he
didn't strike at Saudi Arabia during the moment of opportunity.
They sensed right. The Iraqi dictator has been steadily backing
away since, in one form or another.
   The danger is by no means over. There is still plenty of
opportunity for explosion. But Saddam shifted from power to
propaganda at the moment he chose not to fight. He is trying to
change the subject from the invasion and annexation of Kuwait to an
overall anti-Israeli, anti-colonial, pan-Arabic struggle.
   The challenge to everyone else is now to be as smart and
cooperative in rejecting this ploy as they were in facing Saddam
down militarily.

   The Indianapolis News on reporting the Persian Gulf crisis:
   The Pentagon has developed a bad habit of keeping the news media
from doing their job.
   Beginning with the invasion of Grenada, the Pentagon has fallen
into a pattern of keeping the press from covering the activities of
the U.S. military. This is a grave mistake.
   After Grenada, it happened again in Panama, and it has happened
again in Saudi Arabia. The American public should protest loudly.
   Not until ... seven days after the United States sent troops to
Saudi Arabia did the Pentagon allow U.S. journalists to travel
along with American troops and cover the story. They also waited a
week to grant reporters access to the ships that guard the Gulf of
Oman and the Persian Gulf. ...
   When the United States moves troops, it can and should send
journalists along with them. ...
   The American people have a right to know what is happening to
their sons and daughters. They have a right to know what really is
happening in the Persian Gulf.
   And they have the obligation to see that the Pentagon begins to
act responsibly in its dealings with the press.

   The Oregonian, Portland, Ore., on U.S. military bases in
Philippines:
   Negotiations are scheduled to begin later this month over the
future of U.S. military bases in the Philippines. The treaty
governing the bases expires next year.
   The outcome is uncertain, and the political situation in the
Philippines is unstable. That's why the United States must continue
to pursue alternatives to Philippine bases. Negotiations with
Singapore, for example, should continue even as Manila talks begin.
   Nevertheless, the Philippine bases are important, and for the
talks to have any chance of success, certain steps are needed. ...
   The United States must ... respond to the challenge of the
Philippine Senate's nationalist bloc, the main group opposed to the
bases. The opinion of nationalist senators has to be considered
because the senate must ratify any new bases treaty. They charge
the bases are a remnant of U.S. colonial rule and benefit only the
United States.
   The bases do serve U.S. security interests, but they also
contribute substantially to the Philippine economy and security
against outside aggression.
   The United States might win points by offering to link a new
treaty more securely to the welfare of more Filipinos. For example,
a new treaty could award more ship repair contracts to Filipino
companies but only if they meet U.S. standards of competence and
have a track record of honest business dealings.
   Finally, U.S. representatives must enter the negotiations with a
clear idea of what the United States can afford.

   U.S. soldiers deployed to defend
Saudi Arabia are finding the biggest challenge of desert operations
is carrying enough water.
   To prevent dehydration, the Americans have been told to drink
about five gallons of water a day. That means when soldiers go out
on desert patrols, they're loaded up with an extra 10-15 pounds in
backpacks that already weigh about 30 pounds.
   Because of the extra weight, they have to stop every 15 or 20
minutes for a break.
   ``I usually carry four canteens with me,'' said Lt. James Mead,
a Marine who trained in desert warfare at Twentynine Palms, Calif.,
in the Mojave Desert.
   The Marines and Army are assigned to the eastern province of
Saudi Arabia, but U.S. Defense Department rules prevent identifying
their exact location. The names of enlisted men interviewed cannot
be reported.
   The logistics of hauling enough water for the thousands of
Americans in Saudi Arabia is just one of the hurdles facing troops
as they settle into position. Everywhere soldiers go in the desert,
they drag a 5,000-gallon water tank in a trailer behind their truck.
   Although most of the men have desert experience _ some in Egypt,
Somalia and Jordan _ the reality of a possible long-term assignment
in the broiling sands of the Arabian Peninsula came as a shock.
   ``They said it would be hot, but not this hot,'' said a Marine
as he relaxed in his shorts during a break.
   The United States has not fought a desert war since 1943 when it
joined with Britain to defeat Germany in North Africa. Remembering
that conflict not so far away, a member of the 82nd Airborne
carried a copy of the book ``Rommel's Desert War'' in his pack.
   The temperature rises to above 120 degrees here, creating
furnace-like conditions particularly for airmen in flight suits.
   ``These don't breathe real well,'' said Doug, a Marine Cobra
pilot, pointing to his full body suit made of Nomex, a fire
retardant material.
   The Cobra, an attack helicopter, is air-conditioned, but other
helicopters like the Huey and the CH-53, both used to transport
troops, are not.
   In the sun, the men must stay covered from head to toe, even
wrapping a cloth around the neck to prevent sunburn. All wear hats,
sunglasses and sunscreen.
   Chapped lips have becomed such a problem the Marines have
ordered extra balm, said Maj. Mark Hughes.
   The vastness and unique conditions of the Arabian desert have
posed problems.
   Ground troops often spend twice as long digging a foxhole
because the sand is so fine it collapses on itself.
   Pilots have had trouble reading their navigational maps in a
terrain altered by constantly shifting sands.
   The intense heat affects nagivational equipment, causing slight
variations in the readings.
   In addition, there are the standard problems faced in any desert.
   The sand clogs machinery, forcing added maintenance and extra
spare parts.
   Concealment becomes paramount as the men try to hide their
position in an exposed area. They use camoflauged netting to cover
the tents.
   ``We move at night so people won't see us,'' said Chris, a
Marine platoon commander.
   Delivering supplies is difficult because helicopters and
vehicles leave tell-tale dust clouds and tracks that are easily

<HEAD>Government Destroys Base of Group Opposing Airport Expansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulldozers guarded by thousands of riot police
Wednesday began demolishing the headquarters of a radical group
that has been fighting expansion of Tokyo's international airport.
   Four members of the group were arrested after they threw bottles
and cement at radicals, the officials said.
   Government officials said the action was part of efforts to
complete a long-delayed expansion of the airport at Narita, 40
miles northeast of Tokyo. The airport has only one runway.
   Guarded by 6,500 riot police, bulldozers began demolishing iron
fences surrounding Sanrizuka Struggle Hall, a two-story
prefabricated headquarters built by local farmers and the extremist
group Chukakuha, or Middle Core Faction. The group opposes the
airport expansion as part of its anti-government campaign.
   Four radicals occupying the headquarters defied a government
order to leave the building, which is less than a mile from a
4,400-yard runway under construction.
   The radicals threw bottles and chunks of cement at officials and
reporters before police arrested them.
   In a statement, airport authority president Kauharu Matsui said
the demolition of the headquarters ``is very significant for our
smooth negotiations in the future to obtain the land still
necessary to resume the expansion of the airport, as well for the
airport security.''
   The government plans to build a new terminal and two additional
runways by the end of March 1991 to cope with overcrowding at the
12-year-old airport.
   Of the 2,630 acres of land sought for the expansion project, the
government still needs to acquire 52.6 additional acres, including
40 acres held by eight farmers who refuse to move, said Kaoru
Shirohata, spokesman for the New International Airport Authority.
   The Airport Authority says the airport is handling more than 19
million passengers a year, 6 million more than its official
capacity.

   Prosecutors have filed criminal charges against the
skippers of a Japanese submarine and a fishing boat involved in a
collision two years ago that left 30 people dead, officials said
Wednesday.
   Officials said the case is the first time a Japanese military
officer would face criminal charges in an accident involving a
military vessel.
   The incident occurred July 23, 1988, between the 154-ton sports
fishing boat and the 2,200-ton submarine Nadashio, which was
traveling on the surface near the mouth of Tokyo Bay.
   Keisuke Yamashita, who was captain of the submarine, and Manji
Kondon, skipper of the fishing boat, were charged Tuesday with
interference of sea traffic and professional negligence resulting
in injury and death, according to the Yokohama District Public
Prosecutor's Office.
   The maximum penalty for the charges is five years in prison or a
fine of $1,360.

   News-Republic, Baraboo, Wis., on Marion Barry:
   Washington, D.C., residents have been cheering (the) virtual
acquittal of Mayor Marion Barry on drug charges.
   It's a strange situation, considering what should have been
destructive testimony that Barry has been a drug user.
   While the mayor was found guilty of one misdemeanor drug
possession charge, a mistrial was declared on 12 other charges,
including felonies.
   Barry could still be re-tried on the charges, and attorneys are
considering such a move.
   But, in the meantime, Barry has received what amounts to a
hero's welcome from many residents of Washington.
   That's a sad commentary on conditions in the nation's capital.
During Barry's trial, his defense counsel admitted that Barry has
used cocaine _ a very dangerous drug.
   That means that Barry lied to the nation and to his constituents
when he earlier denied involvement with drugs. Further, he used his
office to perpetrate and advance that lie.
   All the while, he was factitiously engaged in a war against
drugs.
   Barry's supporters have said that the trial's outcome was
vindication from a persecution by federal officials. They have
labeled it a battle between the white establishment and
disenfranchised blacks.
   In their current support of Barry, what they are really saying
is that it's OK to use drugs if you're black, and that legal action
against black users is racial persecution.
   They have put a man above the law in a system where the rule of
law is paramount.
   Barry should be ashamed and step down from public office. He has
violated the public trust. Yet, his fans cheered the outcome of the
trial, and Barry plans to run for a spot on the city's council.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on the need for students to speak
English:
   Few should argue with Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos'
insistence that children in the United States are not ready to
learn if they cannot speak English on their first day of school.
The position particularly angers Hispanics and educators.
   For many non-English-speaking students, the burden of learning
both a new language and simultaneously studying other subjects can
be a heavy one. That child often starts dropping behind classmates
almost immediately. Many never catch up, an observation supported
by high dropout statistics among the children of many minority
groups.
   Criticism of the Cavazos position is ethnocentric and ignores
the fact that most of the nation's commerce, government, education
and communication is conducted exclusively in English. Those with a
poor command of the language are at an immediate disadvantage in
the community.
   Cavazos is of a generation of Hispanics that recalls with some
bitterness punishment meted out in both private and public schools
to those who spoke Spanish in the classroom. Practices have
changed, but the need for children to speak and understand English
very early in their school years has not.

   The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch on genetic engineering:
   More than 100 genetically engineered drugs, vaccines and other
substances have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
These have been used against diabetes and hemophilia, among other
things, in recent years. The good they have done is incalculable.
   But there is a downside, too, particularly when a genetically
engineered substance is not considered a drug, and therefore does
not come under close FDA scrutiny.
   And that is what happened with tainted L-tryptophan that last
year killed 27 and injured 1,500 Americans. The genetically
engineered bacterium, developed by a Janapese drug company, Showa
Denko K.K., was widely used as a nutritional supplement and sleep
aid.
   In the genetic engineering process, it's believed a byproduct
called Peak E was produced, which may cause EMS, a rare and
sometimes fatal blood disease.
   Although bacteria have been used for years in the manufacture of
biologically active substances, only since 1975 have there been
man-made alterations in the genetic structures of common bacteria.
   This may be the first known example of biotechnology gone awry,
but even so it raises serious questions about the nation's growing
biotechnology industry. Should there be more supervision? If so,
should the government do it? ...
   FDA officials have said the growing use of genetic engineering
in the manufacture of drugs and dietary products is something the
agency plans to look at in the future.
   Let's hope the agency does this before another accident produces
deadly results.

   New Haven (Conn.) Register on margarine:
   Add another memo to your ``everything in moderation'' file:
Gorging on margarine, instead of butter, is not the way to stave
off heart disease.
   A Dutch study, published in ... The New England Journal of
Medicine, found that margarine contains fatty acids that actually
increase coronary risk by raising blood levels of a harmful form of
cholesterol and lowering the levels of a form that protects against
heart disease.
   Doctors are quick to caution people not to switch back to
gorging on butter. Butter still has a more damaging effect on
cholesterol than margarine. Doctors wisely advise people, instead,
to use margarine, in fact all fats, in moderation.
   Doctors would probably also be the first to agree that you don't
have to spend a decade in medical school to develop a recipe for a
healthful life and lifestyle. If we all adhered to the common sense
rule of ``everything in moderation'' _ food, exercise, work,
television, even anger _ we'd all probably be healthier and
happier. It's excess that ruins us, not moderation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 13 Congressmen belong to National
Guard or military reserve units, but they can't be called to active
duty unless they first give up their seats.
   Any time there is a mobilization of Guard and reserve units, the
Pentagon automatically puts members of Congress and other top
government officials who are reservists or Guardsmen on standby.
``Their name is in a computer; that's about all it amounts to,''
said a congressional staffer who didn't want his name used.
   To see active military duty, whether combat or a war of nerves
with Iraq's Saddam Hussein, members of Congress would have to first
surrender their seats.
   Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., a captain and member of the judge
advocate's corps in the Air Force Reserve, said lawmakers weren't
likely to resign for a limited call-up.
   ``If there is an acknowledged war and the entire nation is
mobilized,'' McCurdy said, ``I think we'll all go.''
   Seven of McCurdy's colleagues are in the reserves and five more
are active in their state National Guard units. All fall under
federal guidelines that require officials in line of succession to
the presidency, members of Congress and other key officials to
transfer from ready to standby reserve status.
   They may participate in drills and training exercises, and
collect points for retirement pensions. But they cannot be paid or
activated.
   Rep. Thomas Carper, D-Del., a Navy Reserve commander and
decorated flight officer in the Vietnam War, said he had to get a
waiver from the chief of naval operations to keep flying and
maintain his status as a qualified mission commander aboard a P3
surveillance plane, the type of aircraft now tracking merchant
shipping to and from Iraq.
   ``When I was elected in 1982, I learned I could no longer hold a
mobilization billet even though I'm a member of a combat-ready
patrol squadron,'' Carper said.
   Former Rep. John O. Marsh Jr., a Virginia Democrat and later
secretary of the Army, was the last lawmaker to go to war while
still holding a seat in Congress. He was a major in the Virginia
National Guard when he volunteered to spend a 30-day active-duty
tour in Vietnam during a 1966 congressional Christmas recess.
   ``I got on a regular lift just like any other replacement troops
going over,'' he said. ``Only a few people there knew I was a
member of Congress. The agreement I had with the chief of staff of
the Army was there would be no publicity.''
   Since the Civil War, presidents and members of Congress alike
have recognized an inherent conflict in having lawmakers who
exercise civilian control and oversight of the military
simultaneously serve under military commanders.
   President Lincoln prohibited his generals from allowing
lawmakers to join them in combat after his close friend, Sen.
Edward Baker, R-Ore., crossed the Potomac to take part in the
Battle of Balls Bluff and was killed.
   Denied a leave of absence for a second tour of duty in World War
II, Republican Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts gave up his seat
in Congress in 1944 to join the fighting in Europe. He had been
granted one Senate leave, to serve in 1942 with American tank crews
in Libya.
   But after other lawmakers _ including a then-junior House
Democrat from Texas, Lyndon Johnson _ demanded ``cameo appearance''
tours, the War Department in 1943 stopped activating sitting
members of Congress.
   ``It's a pretty basic conflict of interest,'' said Senate
Historian Richard A. Baker. ``It was inconveniencing a lot of
people and there was a big concern that a lot of it was being done
for political considerations.''
   There was also the concern that services would use reserve
promotions to reward legislators for shepherding projects or
weapons systems through the complex authorization and
appropriations webs of Congress.
   ``I don't think in this day and age that you can serve two
masters,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., also a Navy Reserve
commander.

   Iraq, in its latest use of trapped foreigners to pressure the
international community, said today it would allow some French and
Japanese nationals stranded in Iraq and occupied Kuwait to leave as
a ``goodwill gesture.''
   Earlier today, Iraqi newspapers had warned Japan and Europe not
to ``walk in the steps of Washington'' by helping the multinational
force deployed to protect Iraq's neighbor, Saudi Arabia.
   About 731 Japanese and 560 French citizens were trapped in Iraq
and Kuwait when Iraq invaded the emirate on Aug.2.
   Meanwhile, there were signs today that an escape route for
thousands of foreigners _ mainly Arab nationals _ might be
restricted. Jordan's King Hussein said his country is heavily
burdened by refugees fleeing Kuwait and may have to ``slow down the
process'' of receiving them.
   ``We have received within Jordan since the beginning of this
crisis an approximate number of 185,000 people of different
nationalities,'' he told a news conference in Amman today.
   ``We are finding enormous difficulty in meeting the needs of
these people or in arranging adequate modes of transport for them
to leave Jordan.''
   Baghdad's latest announcement, carried by the official Iraqi
News Agency, quoted Sadi Mehdi Saleh, the speaker of the Iraqi
Parliament, as saying lawmakers ``decided to make yet another
goodwill gesture and allow some French and Japanese nationals to
travel out of Iraq.''
   He did not say how many people the decision involved, nor
elaborate on when exactly they would be allowed to leave.
   The move came as Western governments renewed their protests over
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's vow to use trapped foreigners as
human shields for vital installations in the event of an attack.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain today denounced Saddam
as a ``destructive loser'' whose hostage-taking reflects his
isolation. The British Foreign Office said 21 Britons are known to
be held at Iraqi military installations.
   ``This human shield policy is ... not going to work,'' Hurd said.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France said the National
Assembly would hold an special session on Monday to discuss the
crisis. He alco called the trapped Westerners ``hostages.''
   ``When you are told that they may be freed in exchange for a
political or military benefit, they are hostages,'' he said.
``There is no need to hide behind semantics.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 18 Americans got out
of Kuwait Tuesday but ``there are still 54 Americans missing'' _ 13
in Kuwait and 41 in Iraq. More than 3,000 Americans are among the
thousands of foreigners who were trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the
Iraqi invasion of its oil-rich neighbor.
   President Bush has described the Americans as hostages and said
he would hold Iraq responsible for their safety.
   On Tuesday, Iraqi authorities told Western ambassadors that
citizens of seven European Community nations who are in occupied
Kuwait would be allowed to leave, an Italian Foreign Ministry
official said.
   The action would affect citizens of Italy, Belgium, Spain,
Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and Greece, the official said.
   But the Dutch ambassador to Iraq denied reports that Dutch
nationals are allowed to leave Kuwait. The Dutch Foreign Ministry
said 147 nationals are in Iraq and 83 in Kuwait.
   Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen warned that Iraq's
reported willingness to release some European Community citizens
from Kuwait could be an attempt to divide Western countries who
support sanctions against Iraq and have deployed forces to the
region.
   There are 83 Danes stranded in Kuwait and 17 in Iraq.
   Irish officials said today they were trying to confirm reports
that the 50 Irish citizens in Kuwait would be allowed to leave.
   Also today, Iraqis detained about 130 Swedes, Finns and
Austrians at the Turkish border after an 800-mile trek across the
desert from Kuwait. The Iraqis said their documents were not in
order, Swedish officials said.
   The convoy of buses and cars arrived at the border this morning
after 30 hours of driving across Iraq, and were still waiting three
hours later to cross into Turkey, Swedish radio reports said.
   The convoy was held up on the Iraqi side of the border because
local officials had not been told that it had permission to leave
Kuwait, said Lars-Olaf Lundberg, a spokesman for the Swedish
Foreign Ministry.
   Swedish officials had said Tuesday that 250 Swedes, Finns, Swiss
and other foreign citizens had been given permission to drive out
of Kuwait.
   The status of foreign missions in Kuwait, too, was unclear.
   Saddam on Monday demanded the closing of embassies in Kuwait
City by Friday, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman said diplomatic
personnel who stayed ``will be treated ... as ordinary foreign
nationals.''
   Washington was making contingency plans to reduce the number of
U.S. diplomats in Kuwait, but U.S. officials said today they would
not close the embassy. ``Obviously, we need to maintain an
essential presence to take care of American citizens,'' a U.S.
official told The Associated Press late Tuesday.
   There are about 120 U.S. diplomats in Kuwait. They are concerned
mainly with keeping track of the 2,500 or so Americans trapped in
the emirate since Iraq's invasion three weeks ago.
   Britain and the Soviet Union already have decided to scale down
their diplomatic presence in Kuwait without ceasing operations.
   Nine West European nations, meeting Tuesday in Paris, rejected
the ultimatum and asserted their intention to remain open.

<TEXT>
   A widely used epilepsy drug reduces the risk of
seizures by 73 percent during the first week after a serious head
injury but is ineffective after that, a study concludes.
   Seizures are a hazard of serious head trauma, and doctors
routinely prescribe the drug Dilantin for up to three years after
the injuries.
   However, some researchers in recent years have questioned
whether this treatment works. To help resolve these doubts, the
latest study tested Dilantin, known generically as phenytoin, for
one year.
   The study ``provides convincing evidence of the effectiveness of
phenytoin in preventing seizures during the first week after
serious head injury,'' the researchers wrote.
   An estimated 500,000 Americans suffer head trauma that result in
brain injury each year. About 2 percent suffer recurring seizures
as a result.
   The study, directed by Dr. Nancy R. Temkin at the University of
Washington in Seattle, was published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine. It was financed in part by
Warner-Lambert-Park-Davis, which makes Dilantin.
   In the research, people with serious head injuries were randomly
assigned to take Dilantin or placebos.
   During the first week, 4 percent of those getting Dilantin
suffered seizures, compared with 14 percent in the placebo group.
However, over the next two years, there was no significant
difference.
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. W. Allen Hauser
of Columbia University said the study ``provides answers to
important questions.''

   A young man convicted of unlawful imprisonment
in the killing of a black man by a gang of whites in the
Bensonhurst neighborhood was sentenced today to two and two-thirds
to eight years in prison.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens sentenced John Vento
to the maximum one and one-third to four years on each count, with
the sentences to run consecutively.
   Vento also was sentenced to 90 days on each of four menacing
counts. Those terms are to run concurrently with the longer terms.
   ``I'm very sorry about what happened,'' Vento said before he was
sentenced. ``When somebody talks about sleepless nights _ I have
many.''
   After nine days of often bitter deliberations following a
weeklong trial, a jury acquitted Vento on July 3 of the most
serious charge _ intentional murder _ but deadlocked over a second
murder count and a riot charge.
   Owens ordered a new trial on the unresolved charges for Sept.
17. Vento is to be tried with a co-defendant, Charles Stressler.
Four other defendants are to be tried later.
   The defendants, all young white residents of Bensonhurst section
of Brooklyn, are charged in the Aug. 23 fatal shooting of Yusuf
Hawkins after Hawkins and three friends, all black teen-agers, went
to Bensonhurst to look at a used car.
   Soon after the killing, Vento contacted prosecutors. He agreed
to cooperate in the investigation and voluntarily appeared before a
grand jury. But around the first of the year, Vento fled the city
and reneged on his deal.
   In May, Joseph Fama was convicted of murdering Hawkins. Keith
Mondello, the ringleader of the young whites, was acquitted of
murder and manslaughter charges, but convicted of riot, unlawful
imprisonment and other crimes.
   Owens gave each the maximum sentence _ 32 and two-thirds years
to life for Fama and five and one-third years to 16 years for
Mondello.

<TEXT>
   First came several Kuwaiti refugees,
expressing their gratitude for the hospitality of the Saudi
government.
   Next came a man involved in a land dispute. A short time later
there was a man seeking help finding medical treatment. Another
came to offer a poem.
   Prince Muhammad bin Fahd bin Abdul Aziz, the son of King Fahd
and governor of Arabia's oil-rich Eastern Province, had time for
each of them.
   Muhammad was holding open court Wednesday in his ornate palace,
continuing a tribal tradition of being host to a daily Majlis,
complete with a Bedouin royal guard.
   In Saudi Arabia, even the king is obliged to hold Majlis and
anyone is welcome.
   Some of those who brought problems or praise to Muhammad on
Wednesday wore gold-braided abayas over their ankle-length thobes,
the traditional white shirtdresses worn by Saudi men. Other wore
dingy thobes and tattered sandals.
   All got a few minutes of the prince's time, and his promise to
look into their concerns.
   Watching was a horde of reporters from the United States, Europe
and Japan, who listened intently to discussions of local land
disputes before seeking Muhammad's view on the larger dispute that
had brought them there _ the Iraqi invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
   The Kuwaitis, he said, are welcome in Saudi Arabia and will be
housed for free, offered medical care and even pocket money if
necessary.
   ``The Kuwaitis are like brothers,'' he said. ``Any number are
welcome in this country.''
   It is Muhammad's province, which makes up 30 percent of Saudi
Arabia and borders Kuwait and Iraq, that will bear the brunt of the
Kuwaiti influx and the thousands of American and other troops
flooding into the kingdom to defend it and its oil fields.
   The Eastern Province would be the major prize for any invader:
It has the richest oil fields in the world, the country's
petrochemical and other industries and is home of a sprawling,
ultramodern Persian Gulf port.
   Muhammad hopes aloud that economic and political sanctions will
force Iraq's Saddam Hussein to pull his troops from Kuwait.
   But, if necessary, he says Saudis are ready to die for their
country.
   ``Saudi Arabia will never start war,'' he said. ``We are only
defending our country.''
   Muhammad said the American and other foreign troops were
welcome, but that he hoped they, like the Kuwaitis, soon would be
able to head home.
   ``These friendly forces are here for a purpose and when their
purpose is finished and there is no reason for them to be here they
will go home,'' Muhammad said.
   The opening of the Majlis to foreign reporters was the latest in
a series of events this past week that have given the West an
unprecedented look at the Saudi government and society.
   The Majlis dates to the country's nomadic, tribal days and the
guidance of the Koran that Moslems confer among themselves to
settle disputes and make policy.
   There were about 100 people waiting in chairs arranged around
the huge hall. After Muhammad entered, everyone shook his hand and
offered greetings. Those with problems formed a line, carrying a
written explanation of their problem.
   Muhammad tells the man seeking medical help he will have aides
look into the matter. Several men with land disputes, including one
who said he faces fines for building a store without government
permission, get the same response.
   With the crowd of journalists circled around him, Muhammad tells
the man offering a poem, ``We have no time now.''
   After the meeting, he would rather talk about the local
government and its traditions than the Iraqi forces fewer than 200
miles to the north and their impact on life in Saudi Arabia.
   When a reporter asks if Saudi Arabia is likely to move toward a
democracy, Muhammad looks around at the local people and says:
``This is democracy. ... Saudi Arabia is improving every year. I
don't think we need to change except for the better.''

   Exposure to house-dust mites during infancy
appears to be an important cause of childhood asthma in places
where the climate is humid year-round, a study concludes.
   The study, conducted in England's soggy south, found that babies
who lived in homes with high levels of dust mites had an especially
high risk of suffering asthma as they grew older.
   The work supports the growing belief that a variety of proteins
from common household creatures, especially cats and cockroaches,
can trigger this frequent childhood illness.
   It also suggests that modern home construction, including
insulation and central heating, is raising the risk of asthma.
   ``Has the modern world gone wrong about house design somewhere
so we are doing something to make houses more of a risk to
children?'' asked Dr. Thomas A.E. Platts-Mills.
   Platts-Mills, a researcher at the University of Virginia, is a
co-author of the study published in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   He said that between 4 percent and 8 percent of U.S. youngsters
have asthma. The problem tends to go away as people get older, but
it can remain a lifelong problem.
   His study was based on a survey of 67 children in Poole,
England. Researchers check for house-dust mites by testing samples
of dust from their homes.
   By age 11, 17 children had asthma. All but one had been exposed
to high levels of house-dust mites at age 1.
   The tiny mites are an unseen but common inhabitant of houses
everywhere. They are especially common in places with humid
year-round climates. Platts-Mills said that places in the United
States where they are likely to be a problem include Florida,
Seattle and Galveston, Texas.
   In the study, children had an elevated risk if the house dust in
their homes contained 500 or more mites per gram. However, houses
can have high levels of mites and still look perfectly clean.
   Children whose asthma is triggered by house-dust mites are
allergic to a form of cysteine proteinase, a protein found in the
mites' gastrointestinal tracts and droppings.
   In house construction, Platts-Mills said, ``the critical
offenses are carpets, central heating and tight housing. If you put
these three together, you raise the temperature. And if you
increase the tightness of the house without dehumidification, you
raise humidity and create ideal conditions for microbes.''
   Wall-to-wall carpeting is an especially cozy breeding ground for
mites, he said. Vacuuming fails to pick up the bugs and their
droppings. Shampooing the rugs aggravates the problem by increasing
dampness.
   He offered these tips for holding down levels of the creatures:
   _ Wash blankets and pillows every 10 days.
   _ Use hot water in washing. Avoid cold-water detergents, which
fail to kill the mites.
   _ Use air conditioning and dehumidifiers to keep humidity below
50 percent.
   _ Don't vacuum rugs when children are in the room, because this
stirs up the mites.

   The third espionage trial of former FBI Agent
Richard W. Miller began today, as the prosecution outlined its case
against the former hapless agent and his involvement with a married
Soviet emigre.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Schiff told the judge in the
non-jury trial that Miller passed a secret document to a woman who
later pleaded guilty to being a Soviet spy.
   Miller, wearing a tan suit over his large frame, took notes
while Schiff delivered his opening statement. Miller's two sons,
wearing gray business suits, sat among the spectators behind him in
the courtroom.
   A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Miller's statement to his
boss that he had traded a secret U.S. document for sex and money
will be allowed into evidence.
   At Tuesday's pretrial hearing Miller, the first FBI agent
convicted of spying, said his 1984 confession was false and that he
simply said what he thought his interrogators wanted to hear.
   ``I wanted to be honest and I wanted to be so honest that the
statements I made were to the benefit of the FBI. I wanted no stone
unturned,'' Miller said.
   But later, ``I came to the conclusion that I did not give
anybody any document,'' he said.
   In a defense motion, Millier claimed as he had before his first
trial, that religion unduly influenced his Oct. 2, 1984, meeting
with his boss, Richard Bretzing, and fellow agent Phillip
Christensen.
   Bretzing, who was then in charge of the Los Angeles office, was
a bishop in the Mormon church. Christensen also is a Mormon. At the
time, Miller had been excommunicated from the church.
   According to testimony, Miller asked the agents for their
``blessing'' during a break in his interrogation.
   ``I looked to Mr. Christensen and Mr. Bretzing as spiritual
advisers. I looked to them for strength and clarity of all the
confusion that was in my mind,'' Miller said.
   But under grilling from Schiff, Miller appeared to contradict
the defense's contention of undue religious influence.
   ``When you made those statements that you gave documents to (a
Soviet spy), those admissions had nothing to do with religion, did
they?'' Schiff asked.
   After a long pause, Miller answered, ``No.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi refused to suppress the
admission on Tuesday, saying he would take into account the
question of religious influence when he weighs the admission as
evidence. Takasugi is hearing the case without a jury.
   In two earlier trials Miller, a 20-year veteran of the agency,
was portrayed as a fat bumbler who had an affair with a married
Soviet emigre.
   Prosecutors said Miller, now a private investigator's assistant,
became bitter and vengeful after repeated FBI reprimands over his
ballooning weight and inept performance.
   They said he was easily recruited as a spy who passed secrets to
Svetlana Ogorodnikov in exchange for sex and $65,000 in cash and
gold.
   But his lawyers said Miller actually wanted to save his career
by trying to infiltrate the KGB.
   Miller admits he had an affair with Ms. Ogorodnikov, but denies
ever passing her government secrets. Ms. Ogorodnikov and her
husband, Nikolay Ogorodnikov, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
commit espionage and were sentenced to prison.
   Miller was imprisoned for five years before being granted bail
in October 1989 by the appellate court. He was released from prison
in November 1989 after posting $337,000 bail.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the jury in the
second trial wrongly heard about Miller's lie detector tests.

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar was
convicted today of illegally disclosing a wiretap to its target and
lying to the FBI with the intent to obstruct a grand jury
investigation.
   Aguilar was acquitted of three other charges. He could be
sentenced to five years in prison for each of his convictions and
faces likely impeachment and removal from office by Congress if
either count is upheld on appeal.
   A U.S. District Court jury returned the verdict after
deliberating a little more than four days in Aguilar's second
trial. Another jury acquitted him of one charge at his first trial
in March and deadlocked on seven others.
   After the first trial, the prosecution dropped two counts,
including an unprecedented charge that Aguilar used his federal
judgeship as a ``racketeering enterprise'' to obstruct justice.
   Aguilar, 59, of San Jose, was appointed to the bench in 1980 by
President Carter. His lawyers and supporters have accused the
Justice Department of targeting him as a liberal judge who has
ruled against the government in important cases, an accusation the
department has denied.
   He was convicted of:
   _Disclosing to Abe Chapman, an elderly ex-mobster and a former
relative of Aguilar by marriage, in February 1988 that Chapman was
the s close
down its embassy in conquered Kuwait, and cracks appeared in what
had been unprecedented U.S.-Soviet unity in the 3-week-old Persian
Gulf crisis.
   In the gulf, the military buildup intensified.
   President Bush today ordered military reserves to active duty,
and the U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga today steamed through
Egypt's Suez Canal toward the Red Sea to join a growing American
flotilla, a canal spokesman said.
   Iraq offered today to free some French and Japanese nationals
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait in what it called a ``goodwill
gesture.'' The move came as Iraqi newspapers urged Europe and Japan
to stop supporting U.S.-led military and economic offensives
against Iraq.
   The Iraqi statement, carried by the official news agency, did
not say how many of the 731 Japanese and 560 French citizens
trapped in the two countries would be freed, or when they would be
allowed to go.
   Western nations have protested the detention of foreigners
trapped in the wake of the invasion and their use as human shields
against possible attack.
   In Moscow, a Soviet official disclosed today that military
experts sent to Iraq before its invasion of Kuwait continue to work
for the Iraqi government despite a Kremlin pledge to go along with
sanctions aimed at isolating Iraq.
   Col. Valentin Ogurtsov said the 193 Soviet experts have been
training Iraqi soldiers to use Soviet-built weapons, repairing and
maintaining those weapons, and building test ranges. But he said
the advisers were not involved in military operations and did not
give advice on the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The Soviets were also slowing U.S. efforts to get U.N. approval
for a military blockade, Western diplomats said. The diplomats said
Tuesday that Moscow has sought clear and demonstrable failure of
the U.N. embargo before approving any U.N. military force.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council met
today to discuss a proposal to enforce the embargo. U.S. and other
warships already have been shadowing Iraqi vessels.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, on his way into the meeting
in New York, declined to specifically blame the Soviets for
foot-dragging, but said he hoped for action on the matter today.
   One weak spot in the enforcement of sanctions has been Jordan,
which has allowed shipments to and from Iraq to pass. Jordan's King
Hussein said at a news conference in Amman today his country was
overburdened by thousands of refugees _ mostly Arabs _ fleeing Iraq
and Kuwait via Jordan.
   He linked the refugee problem to the sanctions. Asked when
Jordan would fully enforce the sanctions, he said, ``When...we can
slow traffic through the border. Thousands are crossing daily and
we are trying to slow this down.''
   In Washington, the State Department today announced the U.S.
intention to defy Saddam's demand to close the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait by Friday, but indicated it would reduce the staff.
   Other nations, including Britain, have announced plans to do the
same.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the decision was
consistent with ``our obligations to the American private
community'' of about 2,500 people in Kuwait. An estimated 500
Americans are trapped in Iraq.
   Pope John Paul II, in his first public comment on the crisis,
today pointed to the ``the danger of war'' and offered a prayer for
peace. A day earlier, the pontiff met with the Vatican envoy to
both Iraq and Kuwait to discuss the situation, and papal spokesman
Joaquin Navarro said the diplomat is ready to pursue any
humanitarian initiatives if asked.
   Meanwhile, an Iraqi tanker that had defied warning shots from an
American warship, reached Yemen's port of Aden today and dropped
anchor near two other Iraqi ships already there. Yemen had told the
U.N. Security Council that it would adhere to the sanctions against
Iraq.
   Yemeni officials would not comment on the tanker's presence
today. But the official Yemeni news agency quoted an unidentified
Foreign Ministry official on Tuesday as saying Yemen did not intend
to ``intercept or obstruct'' any ships.
   With no sign of letup in the crisis, the Tokyo stock market
tumbled today. Oil prices edged higher in London on crisis jitters
today, and were also up in late-morning trade on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   In diplomatic activity on the crisis, Saudi Prince Bandar bin
Sultan arrived in the Soviet Union, the official Soviet news agency
Tass said. Also, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak conferred today
with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama on the gulf crisis,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
   Also today, defense ministers from the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council met today in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a
unified defense strategy to complement the U.S.-led military
buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   Baghdad has expressed willingness to negotiate with the United
States, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the
offer Tuesday as the ``same old litany from Iraq.'' He said no
talks are possible until Iraq withdraws its tens of thousands of
troops from Kuwait.
   In a speech directed at Bush, Saddam defended detaining
foreigners and promised ``a major catastrophe'' if fighting breaks
out.
   Of the 3,000 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the
invasion, 54 are believed to have been seized by Iraqi authorities,
the State Department said Tuesday. Iraq says it is using some as
human shields at military installations.
   The British Foreign Office said today that 21 Britons are known
to be held at Iraqi military installations. British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd denounced Saddam today as a ``destructive
loser'' whose hostage-taking reflects his isolation in the region
and the world.
   Iraq's reported willingness to selectively release foreigners
from Kuwait could be an attempt to split the Western countries,
Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen cautioned today.
   That was underscored by an Iraqi newspaper's warning today to
Europe and Japan, telling them their own interests would be harmed
if they ``walk in the steps of Washington.''
   The state-run Al-Gomhuriya warned France, Italy, West Germany
and Japan not to participate in what it termed ``American
occupation of the gulf oilfields.''
   U.S. forces in the gulf, meanwhile, continued to grow.
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga and the guided missile
cruisers Biddle and Philippine Sea sailed through Egypt's Suez
Canal today en route from the Mediterranean to the gulf region,
said canal officials.
   The Saratoga joins the carriers Eisenhower in the Red Sea and
the Independence, stationed in the Arabian Sea just outside the
Persian Gulf. A fourth aircraft carrier, the Kennedy, is enroute to
the Mediterranean.
   More than 25 U.S. warships are in the region.
   U.S. Air Force Gen. Hansford T. Johnson estimated Tuesday that
at least 35,000 American military personnel are either in or en
route to the kingdom. In addition 20,000 sailors are aboard U.S.
ships deployed in the region.

   A woman driving a pickup truck crashed
through the gate at the home of Grand Ole Opry star Porter Wagoner
and then fled, police said.
   Officers obtained warrants charging Glenda Kniphfer with
trespassing and vandalism, both misdemeanors, after the incident
late Tuesday. She was being sought Wednesday.
   Police said she had been ordered off the property before.
   ``It was an old acquaintance that he knew from the past,'' Lt.
Glenn Yates said. ``She'd been drinking and ran her car into a
fence and fled before we got there.''
   ``It's no big deal,'' Wagoner said outside Night Court, which
issued the warrants. ``If it was, I would tell you.''
   Wagoner, known for sequined stage outfits, was Dolly Parton's
duet partner in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He has performed on
the Grand Ole Opry since 1957.

   A Canadian has been arrested for
the second time this month on charges of attempting to perform a
stunt at Niagara Falls.
   Peter E. DeBernardi, 43, was arrested Tuesday near the base of
the Horseshoe Falls and charged with criminal trespass and
attempting to perform a stunt on parks property, said a Niagara
Parks Police spokesman.
   Police would not elaborate on DeBernardi's planned stunt. The
Buffalo News, quoting unidentified sources, said DeBernardi had a
length of rope with him and speculated that he might have planned
to try repeating a 1988 stunt in which he rappelled into the gorge
at the base of the falls.
   DeBernardi and two other men were arrested last week in Niagara
Falls, N.Y., while on their way to attempt a trip over the American
Falls in a plastic-foam ball. Last September, DeBernardi was part
of a two-man team that went over the Horseshoe Falls in a barrel.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spike Lee has denied allegations of
anti-Semitism over his film ``Mo' Better Blues.'' He accused those
making the charges of applying a double standard to his work.
   ``I challenge anyone to tell me why I can't portray two club
owners who happen to be Jewish and who exploit the black musicians
who work for them,'' Lee wrote Wednesday in The New York Times'
Op-Ed page. ``All Jewish club owners are not like this, that's
true, but these two are.''
   The characters, Moe and Josh Flatbush, are a pair of
penny-pinching entrepreneurs who take advantage of black musicians.
   Some Jewish organizations criticized Lee for using stereotypes,
but the director advised his critics to examine Hollywood history
if they want to see real stereotyping.
   ``Not every black person is a pimp, murderer, prostitute,
convict, rapist or drug addict, but that hasn't stopped Hollywood
from writing these roles for African-Americans,'' Lee wrote.
   The criticism will not change the content of his movies, Lee
promised.
   ``If critics tell me that to avoid charges of anti-Semitism, all
Jewish characters I write have to be model citizens, and not one
can be a villain, cheat or a crook, and that no Jewish people have
ever exploited black artists in the history of the entertainment
industry, that's unrealistic and unfair,'' Lee concluded.

<TEXT>
   John Zaccaro Jr. has been a model
probationer and should be released early from probation on a
cocaine-selling conviction, his lawyer argued today.
   The son of 1984 vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
was convicted two years ago of selling one-quarter gram of cocaine
for $25 to an undercover officer while a student at Middlebury
College in Vermont in 1986.
   Zaccaro's attorney, Charles Tetzlaff argued that Zaccaro should
be released from probation early because he is beginning his first
semester as a law student at Catholic University in Washington,
D.C., and would have to return monthly to New York state, which is
supervising his probation.
   The District of Columbia won't accept any probation cases unless
there is less than a year in the term.
   Zaccaro has been serving a sentence of one to five years on
probation. But Tetzlaff said that under New York state regulations,
Zaccaro would be eligible for release from probation in December.
   Addison County States Attorney John Quinn argued that Zaccaro
should be supervised for at least another semester because he was
arrested while in a college atmosphere and now he is back in that
atmosphere.
   Vermont District Judge Francis McCaffery made no immediate
decision on the request to dismiss Zaccaro from probation.
   Zaccaro served three months of his sentence under house arrest
at a Burlington luxury apartment whose amenities were ridiculed by
some who argued the former congresswoman's son received special
treatment from the courts.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tensions in the Middle East pushed up wholesale energy prices
today beyond the $30-a-barrel level for crude oil and depressed
prices of stocks, bonds and the dollar.
   In mid-afternoon trading today on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the October contract for West Texas Intermediate _ the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ was up $1.30 to $30.01 a 42-gallon
barrel.
   The September contract for unleaded gasoline gained 2.44 cents
to $1.035 a gallon, while home heating oil shot up 5.79 cents to
89.50 cents a gallon.
   Analysts blamed the jump in oil on tensions resulting from
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this month.
   On Wall Street, stock prices lost more ground today after an
early attempt to rally fizzled out. Analysts said investors were
concerned about the effect of sharply higher oil prices on the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points in
early trading, was down 21.04 at 2,582.92 by 1 p.m. EDT. Declining
stocks outpaced gainers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   On Tuesday the Dow had closed down 52.48 points at 2,603.96.
   The downturn on Wall Street also he
fighting. Bodies were put in small piles for collection.
   Witnesses said many of the bodies also had been ritually
mutilated. They said police vehicles were attacked in Vosloorus.
   Overnight fighting in Kagiso township west of Johannesburg
killed 20 people, police said. Xhosas fighting Zulus living in a
migrant workers hostel set up burning barricades in streets to try
to prevent attacks, witnesses said.
   Maxwell Mulovhedzi, a security guard, said fighting erupted in
Kagiso when armed Zulus from the hostel attacked passersby.
   ``They attacked an old man with an axe and killed him,'' he
said. ``After a while they attacked another two people, killing
them both.''
   In other township violence:
   _A 13-month baby was burned to death in a house that was
firebombed Tuesday night in Kwathema, according to news reports.
   _A white security guard working for a private company was shot
and killed in Soweto late Tuesday and his shotgun taken, police
said.
   _A black police officer was killed and another officer
critically injured today when two black men hurled a Soviet-made
grenade into their vehicle in Soweto, according to South African
Press Association.
   _Armed blacks also hurled firebombs at police armored vehicles
and shots were fired at police patrols in Kagiso, police said.
   ``Blacks threw stones and petrol bombs at police. In two cases
they fired shots at police, who fired tear gas and then birdshot in
retaliation,'' said a police spokesman, Lt. Ida van Zweel.
   The latest violence raised the death toll for the last 10 days
to at least 502, with hundreds injured, police said. More bodies
were found in other black townships, they said, and the toll was
expected to increase.
   The fighting erupted Aug. 12 between Zulus of the conservative
Inkatha movement and Xhosas, tied to the African National Congress.
   The latest clashes came after government and black leaders
Tuesday called for peace and an end to the fighting. Government
officials also said they hoped the ANC, which did not take part in
the talks, would now join peace efforts.
   But senior ANC leaders declined to comment. ANC leader Nelson
Mandela has refused to meet with Inkatha leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   In talks Tuesday in Pretoria, President F.W. de Klerk conferred
in Pretoria separately with Buthelezi and Gen. Bantu Holomisa, head
of the Xhosa homeland of Transkei, to try to end the bloodshed.
   ``Not only must the bloodshed cease, the war of words must
cease,'' the government and black leaders said in a joint statement
later. ``This has often been interpreted at grassroots level as
license for violence.''
   The South African Youth Congress today accused police of aiding
Inkatha fighters in the township clashes. The congress is an
ANC-affiliated youth organization that is generally more militant
than the parent group.
   Holomisa made a similar charge on Tuesday after meeting with de
Klerk and other government leaders.
   Police and government leaders have repeatedly denied such
charges.
   Holomisa leads a nominally independent homeland in the southeast
part of the country far away from the fighting. He is an ally of
the ANC, the largest black opposition movement, but he has no real
influence outside his region.
   Buthelezi's supporters have been locked in a struggle with the
ANC in Natal Province for the past five year in a contest that has
claimed some 5,000 lives.

   Forget the 48 other states. If you're looking
for good living, go Pacific Northwest, young man, and bring your
friends and family with you.
   Four of the nation's top eight places to live are in Washington
state, while a fifth is next door in Oregon, according to the
fourth annual Money magazine study of The Best Places to Live.
   This year's poll _ done with help from a Portland, Ore.,
consulting firm _ _indicates West is best: the farthest east the
top 10 goes is Columbia, Mo. It's not until Wheeling, W.Va., at No.
12 that the survey gets anywhere near the Atlantic.
   The Northeast does dominate the bottom of the list. The final
five were Waterbury, Conn., Pawtucket, R.I., New Britain, Conn.,
Fall River, Mass., and _ at No. 300 _ Allentown-Bethlehem, Pa.
   Top of the list, A-No. 1, king of the hill, was Bremerton,
Wash., a town of 38,000 in a metropolitan area of 180,900.
   ``Is that right? A year ago they didn't know we existed. What a
difference a year makes,'' said Bremerton Mayor Louis Mentor, a
native of the area across the Puget Sound from Seattle.
   Mentor's not quite right; last year, Bremerton was ranked 179th
out of the top 300. But the mayor has a ready, tongue-in-cheek
explanation for the sudden surge: ``They elected me mayor in
November. Re-election's looking good.''
   Betti Holden, executive director of the Bremerton-Area Chamber
of Commerce, compared the listing to a two-edged sword. ``We're
already anticipating growth in the next decade. What is this
national recognition going to do to the Bremerton area?'' she asked.
   Why Bremerton, you ask? ``A pristine environment, plentiful
jobs, low taxes, housing appreciation, arts and leisure activities
galore _ plus lower house prices and reduced workday stress,''
answers Money.
   Bremerton's Washington neighbors fared pretty well in the poll.
At No. 2 was last year's winner, Seattle, while Tacoma pulled in at
No. 4 and Olympia hit No. 8. All this was _ as you might imagine _
quite pleasing to Washington Gov. Booth Gardner.
   ``It's not surprising that these cities are rated so high
considering the degree of care their residents have for their
neighborhoods and communities,'' he said.
   Need further proof that things are relaxed in the Northwest? Get
put on hold for the governor's office, and soothing music _ like
James Taylor's ``You've Got a Friend'' _ plays on the other end.
   The top 10, in order, were: Bremerton; Seattle; San Francisco;

   Two past winners, Nashua, N.H., and Danbury, Conn., were victims
of ``the bursting of the Northeast's economic balloon.'' Nashua,
No. 1 in 1987, fell from 5 last year to 133; Danbury went from No.
2 last year to 66.
   Biggest gainer on the list: the Monterey Bay, Calif., area,
which jumped from 259 to No. 50. The nation's largest city, New
York, made a comeback of sorts, moving up from No. 50 to No. 28.
   The magazine's methodology remained the same. A sample of 252
Money magazine readers rated the importance of 44 regional
characteristics on a scale of 1 to 10.
   The most important things to the readers were clean water, low
crime, clean air, number of doctors and availability of hospitals.
   Fast Forward of Portland, Ore., assisted the magazine editors in
assigning points to each area based on those characteristics.
   Mentor said his city's best characteristic is its laidback
lifestyle.
   ``It's an easy place. I know it sounds hokey, but we're a little
behind out here,'' said Mentor. ``We may be 10 years behind in the
latests styles. But we're also 10 years behind in crime, in prices,
in housing cost. That's something.''

<HEAD>Ex-Thornburgh Aide Pleads Innocent in Drug Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former top aide to U.S. Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh pleaded innocent Wednesday to drug-related charges
that resulted from a federal investigation of alleged drug use by
public officials.
   Henry Barr, who worked for Thornburgh at the Justice Department
and in Harrisburg when Thornburgh was Pennsylvania's governor, is
apparently the highest-ranking present or former federal official
to face drug charges, said Gordon Zubrod, the prosecutor in charge
of the case.
   Barr pleaded innocent to four counts during a brief hearing
before U.S. District Judge Edwin Kosik.
   Barr, 47, of suburban Harrisburg, is charged with one count of
cocaine possession, two counts of lying to federal officials about
drug use and one count of conspiracy. He was indicted earlier this
month in an investigation that has resulted in guilty pleas from
two former deputy state prosecutors.
   After the hearing, Zubrod said he expects Barr's lawyer to try
to have the indictment thrown out. If that bid is rejected, Zubrod
said, the case could be heard in October.
   Zubrod said that while no additional indictments are pending,
the investigation into alleged drug use by other public officials
remains active. Last week, he gave the impression that the case
against other officials was closed.
   Barr and his lawyer, Charles Scarlata, refused to comment on the
case after the hearing.
   The indictment accused Barr of using cocaine at a suburban
Harrisburg home on April 8, 1989, when he was a special assistant
to the U.S. attorney general.
   It also alleges he lied about drug use on a federal form the FBI
uses to check the backgrounds of people in sensitive jobs and
repeated the lie in an interview with federal agents.
   If convicted on all counts, Barr could face up to 12 years in
prison and fines of $510,000.
   Court documents filed in connection with the investigation show
that Barr was implicated by former state Deputy Attorney General
Richard Guida, who pleaded guilty last week to one count of cocaine
distribution.
   In a brief filed earlier this summer, Guida's lawyer, Paul
Killion, noted that his client ``informed the FBI he had used
cocaine with Henry Barr, the target of this investigation, on New
Year's Eve of 1984,'' and on other occasions in 1985 and in 1987 or
early 1988.
   The documents also identify several other people who allegedly
saw Barr use cocaine.
   Barr's ties to Thornburgh extend two decades, when Barr was a
federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh and Thornburgh was the U.S.
attorney there.
   After a stint with the state attorney general, in which Barr
successfully prosecuted defendants in a lottery-fix case, Barr
served as a top legal aide to then-Gov. Thornburgh from 1982 to
1986.
   He followed Thornburgh to Washington in September 1988, serving
as the Justice Department's liaison to the Drug Enforcement
Administration and other agencies.
   Barr left the department in May 1989, two days after Guida
learned he was a target of the federal investigation, and is now a
lawyer in private practice.
   Thornburgh removed himself from the investigation earlier this
year when he learned that Barr was a target.

   A Ken doll dressed in Barbie's clothing
wasn't a manufacturing mistake after all. It was a stock clerk's
prank.
   A clerk at a Toys R Us store acknowledged Tuesday he redressed
the doll one night while goofing off. The store fired him when he
confessed.
   ``We always did crazy things like that,'' Ron Zero said of the
antics of the store's late-night stockers. ``We'd hang dolls in the
aisle or put Ken and Barbie in the Barbie house with Barbie
spanking Ken.''
   Carina Guillot bought the Ken doll in the Tampa store last month
while visiting from New Jersey. It was dressed in a purple tank top
and a lace-covered purple and turquoise skirt.
   The doll quickly became a national spectacle _ spoofed by
Arsenio Hall, featured on ``The Joan Rivers Show'' and in Newsweek
and Fortune magazines.
   ``Oh well, it generated a lot of excitement for a while,'' Mrs.
Guillot said.
   The director of the store said he was embarrassed and Mattel,
the doll's maker, said it was vindicated.
   The store clerk said he dressed not one but three Ken dolls in
women's clothes. He resealed the boxes with clear glue.
   He said he doesn't know what happened to the first one, and
store managers have the third one. Store managers say that's not
true.
   Zero said he laughed when he saw news stories about the doll.
   ``It was a kid clowning around,'' said store director Greg
Warren. ``We had one fellow with quite a sense of humor.''
   Warren said Zero was fired for tampering with the Ken dolls and
several other toys.

<HEAD>Loud Music Drives Loiterers From Store Parking Lot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It brings back memories of the invasion of
Panama, when American soldiers blared rock music at the Vatican
Embassy to drive Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to surrender.
   But this time American GIs are the target of musical mayhem as a
convenience store, Hoagy's Corner in Tillicum, 45 miles south of
Seattle, plays loud country-western music to keep them from
loitering in its parking lot.
   The 24-hour store, a subsidiary of Southland Corp., which also
owns 7-Eleven stores, rigged up speakers and last Thursday began
playing a country-western radio station around the clock.
   Rocky Ford, general manager at the Tillicum Hoagy's Corner
store, says the music does a good job of keeping GI's from nearby
Camp Murray and Madigan Army Hospital from buying beer and food and
settling down in the parking lot with their car stereos on high.
   ``Sometimes 100 or 150 people are there with their radios
blaring rap music,'' says Ford. ``We've never had a problem with
them in the store. It's when they get their food to go outside.''
   With just one weekend under his belt, Ford says the music
deterrent has worked. Some customers complained about the music as
they entered the store, but once they're inside they listen to
milder music.
   The idea of playing awful music _ defined as anything that
people who hang out can't stand _ came from employees at
Southland's British Columbia division in 1985.
   Now, 10 7-Eleven stores in the Vancouver area pipe Muzak mood
music outside because young people go elsewhere rather than listen
to such all-time favorites as Petula Clark or Perry Como, said Len
McGeouch, the division's loss prevention manager.
   ``It's not the style the younger generation likes,'' McGeouch
said. ``It's not Bon Jovi.''
   ``It's a backwards way of keeping people away, but you could
turn it around and say it's for the kind of people you want to
attract,'' said Leslie Ritter, marketing manager for Muzak, the
Seattle-based company that provides the tapes.
   But the Tillicum store isn't that subtle. Store managers decided
to tune in to a country-western station because at the volume they
wanted the mood music got distorted.
   Other merchants and even nearby residents don't seem to mind, or
at least they haven't called to complain.
   ``They play it loud enough so you can hear it all the time,''
said Susan Pidarson, assistant manager of a 7-Eleven store just
down the highway. ``It's really good music.''

<TEXT>
   Jewish leaders said Wednesday a German
unification treaty must contain a clear statement of responsibility
for the victims of Nazi tyranny.
   In recent years, Jews have warned that younger Germans may begin
to shirk the legacy of Nazi Germany, where 6 million Jews were
murdered.
   As the two German nations come closer together, Jewish leaders
want the past clearly spelled out in the preamble to the treaty
linking both states.
   ``We are insisting that becomes part of the unification
treaty,'' said Heinz Galinksi, chairman of the Central Council of
Jews in Germany. ``That is our demand.''
   Galinski, in a statement distributed by his West Berlin office,
recalled that he had given a draft paragraph to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on July 18.
   In the draft, the 77-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz
concentration camp specified German responsibility for the Nazi era.
   Galinski told The Associated Press he was ``very disappointed''
when West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble responded by
suggesting that the treaty contain general wording about democracy,
peace and human rights.
   There was no specific reference to the 12-years of Nazi rule,
Galinski said. The Nazis came to power in 1933.
   Schaeuble is leading the West German team negotiating the treaty
with officials from East Berlin.
   Jewish leaders insist the passage should specify the
``singularity'' of the Nazi era and acknowledge Germans'
``responsibility to all the victims'' of Hitler's tyranny.
   In addition to the Jews who died, the Nazis killed hundreds of
thousands of gypsies, homosexuals and others deemed undesirable by
the regime.
   The treaty is considered of enormous importance to the
approximately 36,000 Jews in West Germany and the almost 400
practicing Jews in East Germany.
   With the date of unity racing closer, possible East German
reparations to Holocaust victims have been the subject of separate
talks with Jewish leaders. For four decades, East Germany's
Communists refused to pay compensation to Jews, saying that as an
anti-fascist state they were not liable for Hitler's crimes.
   After the fall of the communists last year, the democratically
elected government in East Berlin offered to pay compensation.
   But Frankfurt Jewish community spokesman Michel Friedman said he
was pessimistic on the subject of reparations and said he fears the
matter may be left unresolved until after formal unification.

<HEAD>Seabrook Shuts Down Three Days Into Regular Operation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three days after the Seabrook nuclear
plant launched into regular operation, the reactor on Wednesday had
its eighth unplanned shutdown since connecting to the regional
power grid May 29.
   The $6.6 billion reactor was running at 100 percent power when
the turbine generator prompted an automatic shutdown, said plant
spokesman Ron Sher.
   Seabrook began supplying enough electricity for 1 million homes
Sunday after a five-month testing program.
   All seven shutdowns since the reactor was connected to the New
England power grid were turbine-related and the plant was shut down
for about a month in April for turbine modifications.
   ``Today's shutdown occurred during scheduled maintenance
activities that were taking place on a turbine control system, not
the turbine itself,'' Sher said.
   Seabrook opponents see the shutdowns as confirmation of their
long-held predictions.
   ``We've been talking about construction problems, bad quality
control, for years,'' said Sam Miller of the Clamshell Alliance.
   The plant took 10 years to complete _ 1976-1986 _ and its
operating license was delayed until last spring by people
protesting emergency evacuation plans near the plant.

   Raymond and Michele L'Esperance, parents
of the nation's first test-tube quintuplets and three other
children, have gotten financial help from the state to care for
three nieces.
   ``We are elated,'' Raymond L'Esperance said Tuesday after it was
announced in court that his home had been approved for a
foster-care license. The announcement makes L'Esperance and his
wife, Michele, eligible for about $1,000 a month to care for the
three extra children.
   They had gone to Oakland County Probate Court hoping to speed up
the licensing process, which began in April.
   The L'Esperances began caring for the 6-, 10- and 13-year-old
nieces last year when the girls' parents sought drug and alcohol
rehabilitation.
   The L'Esperances had quintuplets in 1988, believed to be the
first conceived in vitro and successfully carried in the United
States.
   Michele L'Esperance, who works in a home for battered women,
said it costs more than $300 a week just to feed the family. Her
husband is a Macomb County corrections officer and holds a second
job in a tool-and-die shop.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Troops Advance on Besieged Fort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sri Lankan troops landed on rebel-held
Jaffna Peninsula by ship Wednesday and began advancing on a
government fort that has been besieged by rebels for the past 10
weeks, officials said.
   A Western diplomat said it was the first movement by government
troops in six weeks on the peninsula, a key stronghold of the rebel
Tamil Tigers militia.
   The diplomat called the move a ``significant offensive'' but
said government forces were in no position to unleash a knock-out
blow against the rebels. The diplomat spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Authorities said ships ferried 750 to 1,000 troops to a naval
base in the north. The troops then launched an offensive to relieve
the garrison trapped in Jaffna Fort. The naval base is about 12
miles from the 200-year-old fort.
   Jaffna, 186 miles northeast of the capital of Colombo, is the
headquarters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the major
rebel group fighting for Tamil independence from the ethnic
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Government planes Tuesday dropped leaflets on Jaffna announcing
an indefinite curfew and warning the 850,000 civilians there that
the government would mount air strikes against rebel positions.
Most civilians on the peninsula are Tamils.
   The curfew took effect at 6:00 a.m. Wednesday, and warplanes
began bombing runs one hour later, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The bombing apparently was a diversionary tactic while the naval
vessels landed the troops ashore, the officials said.
   Army commander Lt. Gen. Hamilton Wanasinghe flew to Jaffna to
supervise the operation, the military said.
   In a statement released by his office, Deputy Defense Minister
Ranjan Wijeratne assured diplomats there would be no indiscriminate
bombing of civilians and that ``any action would be taken only
after careful intelligence assessment to minimize any loss of
civilian life.''
   But a Western diplomat said Sri Lanka's small, ill-equipped air
force ``has nothing that is able to pound Tiger positions with any
degree of precision.''
   At least 14,000 people have died since the rebels took up arms
against the government.
   The Tigers, who have accused the government of discrimination
against ethnic Tamils, are demanding an independent state in the
north and east where Tamils are most numerous.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, constitute 18 percent of the
population of this Indian Ocean island, while Sinhalese, who are
mostly Buddhist, make up 85 percent of the population and dominate
the military and government.
   Jaffna Fort was surrounded June 11 when the Tigers broke a
13-month cease-fire and resumed their seven-year-old civil war
against the government.
   About 250 Sri Lankan police and soldiers are in the garrison,
which has survived on supplies dropped from high-flying aircraft.
   It was unclear whether the forces would try to lift the siege or
whether the fort would be evacuated.
   Officials said one man in the fort was killed by rebel fire
Tuesday, raising the garrison's casualties to nine in the past
month.
   Wijeratne, briefing Colombo-based diplomats Wednesday, said he
proposed evacuating the fort and handing it over to the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
   He said the Red Cross agreed to the plan, and was waiting for
authorization from the government to discuss it with the rebels.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University Square, the site of a
53-day anti-government demonstration that sparked a bloody
crackdown in June, was again occupied by demonstrators Wednesday.
   About 700 protesters cut off traffic in the square, the
capital's central intersection, and pledged not to leave until
their demands were met.
   The new protest began when a government-sanctioned rally held by
the Democratic Christian Revolutionary Party in nearby Union square
turned into an anti-government demonstration.
   University Square was blocked for 53 days by anti-government
protesters until mid-June, when the police moved to clear the
square. In the violence that followed, thousands of miners,
responding to a call for help from the government, beat protesters
and passers-by and terrorized the capital for two days.
   The violence left six people dead, according to an official
count.
   Demonstrators have since held anti-government protests in the
capital, but until now they were careful not to disrupt traffic in
the square.
   State-run television reported that Bucharest Student League
President Marian Munteanu, an organizer of the previous rally, told
authorities that students were not involved in the current protest.
In June, Munteanu was beaten by miners and hospitalized, then kept
in ``preventative detention'' for six weeks.
   On Wednesday, the demonstrators in the square shouted slogans
equating President Ion Iliescu with former Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, who was deposed and executed in last December's
revolution.
   Wednesday marked eight months to the day that Ceausescu fled
Bucharest's Communist Party headquarters by helicopter with his
wife, Elena. The couple was captured and executed after a summary
trial on Christmas Day.
   Also Wednesday, the trial of Nicu Ceausescu, the late leader's
youngest son, adjourned after the court was presented with medical
evidence that he cannot endure prison conditions. The court was
expected to decide Thursday whether to free the younger Ceausescu
because of his failing health.
   Nicu Ceausescu is formally charged with ``complicity to
genocide,'' but the prosecution has largely failed to provide
concrete evidence that he issued orders to fire at demonstrators
during the December revolution.

   Arab-Americans say they've been subjected to
isolated cases of violence since the Middle East crisis began and
they worry that the anti-Arab mood could become far worse.
   ``Saddam Hussein is an international renegade. It's unfair to
stereotype all Arabs,'' said Jawad F. George, executive director of
the National Association of Arab Americans. ``Arabs are replacing
the Soviet Union as the enemy of the United States.''
   In San Francisco, a professor received a death threat after
telling a newspaper he favored a negotiated settlement to the
crisis. An Arab-American newspaper editor in Detroit was told in a
phone call he would be killed if any Americans were hurt in Kuwait.
   Cleveland police shouted ethnic slurs at an Egyptian grocer and
jailed him for a night after a minor dispute with youngsters in his
neighborhood. A young Palestinian walking in a Chicago supermarket
with his mother was hit and told to go back to Iraq.
   The Los Angeles office of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination
Committee received obscene phone calls.
   ``Whenever there is a crisis in the Middle East, the
Arab-American becomes a scapegoat,'' said Albert Mokhiber, the
committee's director of legal services.
   Mokhiber said the 1985 terrorist attack on the cruise ship
Achille Lauro that led to the death of an American passenger was
followed by the letter-bomb murder of prominent Arab-American Alex
Odeh.
   Mosques were attacked after the 1985 hijacking of a TWA aircraft
to Beirut. Bricks were thrown through the windows of
Iranian-Americans during the hostage siege in Tehran.
   ``The potential (for trouble) may be far worse in this case than
anything we've ever seen,'' Mokhiber said. ``The entire Arab
community is going to be vilified.''
   He and other Arab-American leaders said America's 2.5 million
people of Arab descent already are being negatively linked to Iraq.
Only 150,000 Arab-Americans are of Iraqi origins, and many of those
are refugees from persecution in their homeland.
   ``There's obviously a potential for tarring all Arabs with one
brush,'' said Ann Joyce of the American-Arab Affairs Council.
``Anyone in the field sees this as a disaster.''
   Arab-Americans say TV comedians, radio talk shows and political
cartoonists are creating an anti-Arab hysteria by depicting
``Ay-rabs'' as ugly, hook-nosed, burnoose-draped sheiks or
terrorists. They are referred to as ``camel jockeys'' or
``sandblowers.''
   One Georgia radio station sponsored a ``towel head'' contest.
Other stations are promoting songs with anti-Arab lyrics.
   Jim Zogby, president of the Arab-American Institute, said Arabs
have always been depicted in movies as sinister and lacking in
humanity.
   ``People don't know who we are,'' he said. ``It's terribly
troubling to our community.''
   Khalil Barhoum of the San Francisco chapter of the
Anti-Discrimination Committee said threatening phone calls received
by Bay area Arab-Americans ``made them realize there's a lot of
bigotry. We're all Americans and we should have a right to voice
our opinions.''
   But many Arab-Americans are apparently choosing to muffle even
moderate opinions until the crisis subsides.
   ``There's a feeling of vulnerability, a dread fear that if
shooting begins what is sitting under the surface will rear its
head rather vehemently,'' Zogby said.
   Detroit, home to America's largest Arab-American community of
250,000, has escaped major confrontations thus far.
   ``But there's tension and paranoia and fear,'' said Sam Baraka,
a Palestinian doctor and official of Detroit's Arab Chaldean
Council.
   ``It's very inflammable here and people don't want to speak,''
he said.
   ``Enough is enough, we are American citizens,'' said one
Washington, D.C., Arab-American woman who declined to give her name.
   ``We don't need to be maligned. People say `go back where you
came from,' but we came from here.''

<HEAD>Marriage Registrar Takes Walk Down the Aisle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK RYAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRETNA, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Bryden has performed thousands of
marriages, but Wednesday's ceremony was different. It was her own.
   Ms. Bryden, 58, is the marriage registrar at Gretna, the
Scottish village known worldwide as the place where eloping couples
crossed the English border to tie the knot.
   For her marriage to ex-policeman Archie Smith, however, she
chose to walk down the aisle in nearby St. Andrew's Church.
   ``Although I've married thousands of couples over the years, I
never thought it would happen to me. I'm very, very happy,'' said
the bride, who wore a blue suit with a pleated skirt and a pink hat.
   About 100 well-wishers greeted the couple outside the church,
which was filled with 200 guests.
   ``I was hoping for a quiet wedding, but it wasn't to be. Pat is
too well-known,'' said Smith, 59.
   Smith's wife, Rita, died in 1988, and a few weeks later his home
in the Scottish town of Lockerbie burned down in the wreckage of
Pan Am Flight 103, which was blown up in flight by a terrorist
bomb. Ms. Bryden, a long-time family friend, went to console him
and his two children, and love blossomed.
   ``He needed a lot of support at that time,'' she said. ``I was
there with him.''
   Changing laws and social mores have made it much easier to marry
in Britain, and young lovers no longer arrive breathless with angry
parents in hot pursuit.
   The romantic allure lingers, however, and Gretna still attracts
some 1,400 couples a year _ making Ms. Bryden one of the world's
busiest marriage registrars.
   Ms. Bryden, who had never married, has worked in the Gretna
registry service for about 40 years. Twenty years ago she was
authorized to perform marriages, and has officiated at about 10,000.
   Her office is in a small building which also houses a dentist's
office, and couples sometimes recite their vows to the whine of a
dentist's drill.
   ``From a legal point of view, there's nothing special about
Gretna. Couples could wed just as easily anywhere else in Scotland.
But they come here for the romance,'' Ms. Bryden said.
   ``The village's associations with love and marriage ensure their
wedding will be something different... Something to remember all
their lives,'' she said.
   Gretna's romantic associations date back to 1754 when an act of
Parliament outlawed ``irregular'' marriages in England. No longer
could couples simply declare themselves married in front of
witnesses. They had to publish banns _ a delcaration of the
intended marriage _ and those under 21 needed parental consent.
   The law did not apply in Scotland, so eloping couples headed up
the main road from Carlisle to Glasgow, crossing the River Sark
which marks the boundary of England and Scotland.
   Irregular marriages were banned in Scotland in 1940 but the
marriage industry flourished as a registry office was opened in
Gretna.
   Until the 1970s, when England reduced the marriage age from 21
to 18, thousands of runaways came to Scotland.
   There is usually a waiting list for wedding dates at the
registry office, but work has started on a new office that will
more than double the capacity to 3,000 weddings a year. The
registrar intends to stay at her post.
   ``Gretna will always be a place of romance,'' Ms. Bryden said,
adding: ``I think more and more people will come here to wed in the
future.''
   She receives letters and cards from ``satisfied customers'' all
over the world. Now that she too is taking the plunge, she joked:
   ``I now understand why brides get nervous as their big day
approaches.''

<HEAD>Italian Cardinal Luigi Dadaglio Dies at Age 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian Cardinal Luigi Dadaglio, who held
several Vatican diplomatic posts in North and South America, died
Wednesday at the age of 75.
   The Vatican said Dadaglio had been hospitalized at Rome's
Policlinico Gemelli hospital for several days with a heart ailment.
   Born in northern Italy's Piedmont region, Dadaglio was ordained
a priest in 1937 and joined the Vatican Secretariat of State five
years later.
   He went on to serve in Vatican diplomatic missions in Haiti,
Dominican Republic, the United States, Canada, Australia, Colombia,
Venezuela and Spain. In the United States, he served in Washington
from 1950-53.
   While Dadaglio was posted in Madrid, the Vatican and the Spanish
government signed five accords in 1979 regulating church-state
relations.
   Elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 1985, he helped
organize activities marking the church's Marian Year in 1987-88.
   In a message of condolence, the pope praised Dadaglio for his
``long and generous service in multiple posts carried out with
competence and dedication on behalf of the church and the Holy
See.''
   Dadaglio's death brings the number of members of the College of
Cardinals to 145. Of those, 109 are under the age of 80 and thus
eligible to take part in a conclave to elect a new pope.

<TEXT>
   Russian federation president Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday became the first high-ranking Soviet official to tour the
chain of islands the Soviet Union seized from Japan after World War
II.
   Yeltsin visited Kunashir Island, in the south of the chain known
to the Soviets as the Kurils and to the Japanese as the northern
territories.
   He stressed the islands should remain under Soviet control but
said they should be demilitarized.
   ``This is a place that doesn't deserve to be given up,'' Yeltsin
said, according to an account by the independent news service
Interfax.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said it was the first time
in postwar years that a leader of such high rank had visited the
islands. His visit was cut short because of an approaching storm.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev refused to open a dialogue on
the disputed islands during a meeting last month in Moscow with the
speaker of Japan's parliament.
   The small group of islands, stretching north from the northern
Japanese island of Hokkaido, were seized by Soviet troops in the
last days of World War II, and the dispute has kept Japan and the
Soviet Union from signing a peace treaty to formally end the war.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `The Antietam ...' to include that ship's home

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 19-year-old sailor was killed in an electrical
accident aboard the USS Antietam, making him the second serviceman
to die as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, a Navy spokesman
said Wednesday.
   Petty Officer Third Class Daniel M. Jones, an electrician's mate
aboard the vessel, was electrocuted, said Navy Lt. Victor Beck, a
spokesman in Boston.
   The accident occurred Tuesday during maintenance of the ship's
ventilation system, Beck said. Efforts to resuscitate Jones were
made within three minutes of the accident but he failed to respond.
   The Antietam was deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of
Operation Desert Shield, Beck said. The ship, whose home port is
Long Beach, Calif., is part of the Middle East Force, a group of
warships that normally operates in the gulf. The spokesman said he
did not know if it had reached the gulf when the accident occurred.
   Jones was a resident of Wakefield, 10 miles northwest of Boston,
and graduated from Wakefield High School in 1988.
   ``He was just a very happy kid,'' Patricia Hallinan, a school
administrator, said in a telephone interview. ``He was looking
forward to life. I think the service offered him an opportunity.''
   The Jones family had an unlisted number and could not be reached
immediately.
   The first servicemen to die in the Persian Gulf troop buildup
was Air Force Staff Sgt. John Campisi. The 30-year-old Californian
died Aug. 12 when he was hit by a military truck on a darkened
runway in Saudi Arabia.

   Here is a transcript of President
Bush's news conference Wednesday:
   President Bush: Let me make a brief opening statement, and then
I'll be glad to take any questions.
   First, Secretary Cheney and General Powell have just given me a
very full and, I would say, encouraging briefing on the status of
our deployment to the Persian Gulf. This has been a very
complicated mission, calling for precision, calling for maximum
coordination with Saudi Arabia and the other nations providing
forces. The process has gone smoothly, and we've now moved what
amounts to a medium-sized American city, completely capable of
sustaining itself, all the way over to the Middle East.
   And the Secretary reports that the men and women in the armed
forces have performed with extraordinary ability. Their morale is
high and they've accepted the challenge of their mission with
extraordinary dedication to duty. And I'm very proud of each and
every single one of them. And I want them to know that the American
people are behind them 100 percent, supporting them strongly.
   And it's also crucial that everyone understand we are not in
this alone. We stand shoulder to shoulder right there in the Middle
East with the armed forces of 22 other nations, from the Middle
East, from Europe and around the world.
   Secretary Dick Cheney reports an impressive alliance of
multinational forces that stands behind the United Nations resolve
that Iraq completely and unconditionally withdraw from Kuwait, with
the restoration of the legitimate government in that country. The
United Nations has provided enormous leadership to the whole world
community in pursuing this objective and voting the sanctions
necessary to carrying it out.
   And let's be clear, as the deployment of the forces of the many
nations shows, and as the votes in the United Nations show, this is
not a matter between Iraq and the United States of America. It is
between Iraq and the entire world community _ Arab and non-Arab
alike, all the nations of the world lined up that oppose aggression.
   And as our forces continue to arrive they can look forward to
the support of the finest reserve components in the world. We are
activating those special categories of reservists that are
essential to completing our mission. The United States considers
its reserve forces to be an integral part of the total military
command. These essential personnel will soon be joining the
cohesive organization required to support the military operations
in and around the Arabia Peninsula and I have the highest
confidence in their ability to augment the active forces in this
operation. We continue to pursue our objectives with absolute
determination.
   I might add that I talked to the four leaders of Congress today
and I am very pleased that they are giving us the strong support
they have been _ Speaker Foley, Sen. Mitchell, Sen. Dole,
Congressman Michel. And the world simply cannot waver in its
opposition to the threat that Iraq has placed on the doorstep of
all nations who cherish freedom and the rule of law.
   Now what I plan to do is take some questions. And then I know
you'll have more questions for Secretary Cheney and General Powell.
   And then the discussions that we've had with these two gentlemen
and with Secretary Eagleburger and Gen. Scowcroft, our chief of
staff and Bob Gates, will continue for a little while this
afternoon before they return to Washington.
   But, Dick, I am very grateful to you for your mission _
successful mission. And both to you and Colin, my sincere thanks
for the superb leadership you are giving the United States
military, the superb leadership you are showing in working with
other countries as we pursue these high moral objectives.
   Q: Mr. President, the Soviets have voted with us in the Security
Council for the economic sanctions, but we learned today that they
have 193 military advisors still advising the Iraqi army on how to
use Soviet-built weapons against the allied forces. Do you call
upon them to pull those people out?
   A: Well, I think that frankly, I'd like to see Iraq do what is
civilized and permit foreigners who want to leave leave. But I'm
not going to comment on that, because I don't have this information
that you're telling me about. Maybe Dick Cheney can comment on it
later.
   Q: Sir? May I just follow, sir?
   A: Yeah.
   Q: You've talked to a least a dozen world leaders right from
here in the past week and a half. Have you called President
Gorbachev, and will you call President Gorbachev for his help in
the crisis?
   A: Secretary Baker talked to Foreign Minister Shevardnadze less
than two hours ago, and we are in close touch with the Soviets. At
this point, I can say we are getting superb cooperation from the
Soviets. There may be some differences.
   In fact, I think it's fair to say we've been discussing some of
them regarding the timing of certain further U.N. action. But I
have no argument with the way in which they have cooperated, and I
would expect that Secretary Cheney would agree on that point.

<HEAD>KENNEBUNKPORT: that point.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Could I follow on that, sir?
   A: Yes. Yes.
   Q: Talking about the U.N. _ the action that you would hope to
have, the U.S. forces fired across the bow of a ship that then was
allowed to continue on and is now in Yemen. Why did they not pursue
that farther? Do you want to wait until you now have that U.N.
authority?
   A: Well, you know, we feel we have all the authority we need,
and the world leaders I've talked to, particularly Francois
Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, agree that we have all the
authority we need. We have been trying, and I think prudently so,
to work with other countries around the world. And the more
unanimity we get out of the United Nations, for example, the better.
   So we are prepared to intercept shipping, but where I stand now
is I'm talking to my top advisors here and have been on the phone
to Secretary Baker a couple of times in the last two hours talking
about should the United Nations _ should we give the United Nations
more time to take more productive action? And it has taken
productive action, obviously. The Chapter 7 was a significant step.
   So I think we've made clear to the shipping that they can be
stopped, and that we have the forces to stop them right now. And I
believe that Gen. Powell would back me up on what I've just said.
   So my question is, how much more United Nations action is
required? And so I'm going to continue the discussion asking for
the advice of my officials here. But at this juncture, I'm not
prepared to say whether we're going to insist on U.N. action before
we go further. But I think the record _ the signal must go out to
the world that many countries are prepared to fully enforce these
sanctions, and if there's some U.N. action that will help, so much
the better.
   Q: How long will you wait for that U.N. action?
   A: We haven't made a determination. I think the signal is out
there as we pursue certain vessels and clearly have superior _ have
the demonstrated ability to board these vessels, that we can do it.
So now the question is, how much more U.N. action is beneficiary,
benefits this idea of the world staying more closely together? And
I might be prepared to give a little time _ speaking just for the
U.S., we're only one country there, important one though it may be
_ in order to get more collective action.
   But, on the other hand, I need more advice in terms of the
logistics, where these ships are, what the signal would be if we go
ahead and take action to stop them, which we could confidently do.
   Q: Mr. President, despite demands from the Iraqis that the U.S.
and other countries close their embassies in Kuwait and remove all
their diplomatic personnel, the State Department announced today
that the U.S. would not do that. Why have you decided to take that
course of action, and how can you possibly enforce that?
   A: Because the occupation of Iraq is illegal under international
law, and other countries agree totally that we must not take the
position that this illegal regime can shut down legitimate
embassies as a result of their aggression, that's why.
   Q: But with Iraq in military control of Kuwait, how can you
possibly hope to enforce that?
   A: Well, my view is let's wait and see what happens. I don't go
into these hypothetical questions. I'd like to explain this because
I know there's a lot of them out there, as to what I might not or
might do under certain circumstances. But here _ I think most
countries that I'm aware of _ and I'd defer to Secretary
Eagleburger _ would agree that they will not go along with agreeing
to this kind of affirmation of Iraq aggression, aggression that has
been thoroughly condemned by the United Nations.
   Q: I'd like to ask, please, about your hostage policy. You were
very firm the other day in warning Saddam not to harm the
Americans, but I wonder, as Commander in Chief, sir, do you
consider the U.S. has been provoked right now?
   A: Consider what?
   Q: Has it been provoked? Has the United States been provoked now?
   A: I don't think it's a question of the United States, I think
it's a question of the whole world is being provoked by this
illegal action, outrageous action.
   Q: Do you have a plan for getting ...
   A: I don't discuss hypothetical contingencies.
   But I would reiterate, it is of grave concern to all the
countries whose leaders I've talked to.
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Yeah.
   Q: Will the United States give safe haven to our citizens in
Kuwait and Iraq if, in the embassies if ...
   A: If citizens came to the embassy seeking support and help,
clearly we would do that.

<TEXT>
   Q: Do you have plans to draw down the number of Americans in our
embassy in Kuwait?
   A: I'd like to defer that question to Secretary Eagleburger when
I continue this. There has been talk of it. Indeed, I think we're
talking about taking down some personnel, but I'd like to ask him
to be a little more definitive.
   Q: Mr. President, how constrained do you feel by the Americans
trapped in Kuwait as you make your decisions?
   A: How?
   Q: How constrained do you feel as you make your decisions by the
plight of the Americans in Iraq and ...
   A: I think any decision-maker in the United States or in any of
these countries is concerned about the lives of innocent civilians,
innocent people. And so you weigh that very thoroughly against your
actions. Having said that, international law, in this case the
Chapter 7 sanctions, must be enforced.
   Q: Mr. President, you said last Wednesday at the Pentagon that
part of what we're fighting for, standing for in the desert is our
way of life. Part of our way of life is heavy usage of energy, much
more so than any other industrialized country. We haven't really
heard you call upon Americans to conserve as part of this crisis ...
   A: I call upon Americans to conserve.
   Q: Do you want to elaborate?
   A: No, I think we ought to conserve in times like this. On the
other hand, we're doing everything we can to guarantee that we
don't panic Americans and that there will be an adequate supply of
hydrocarbons. But I think it is a good time to conserve, so I'm
glad you reminded me of that and I would call upon Americans to
conserve. And I think that doesn't mean that life screeches to a
halt, and therefore I would say that. But I also think that we're
going to be able to guarantee an adequate supply of petroleum.
   Q: Mr. President, how many reserves are going to be called up as
a first step?
   A: I will defer that question to Secretary Cheney.
   Q: Mr. President, do you sense any frustration or even
desperation in the recent statements we've been hearing out of Iraq?
   A: I certainly sense a sense of isolation. I think the urgency
in these statements and the high immoderate tone is due to
worldwide isolation.
   And I think that's very clear and I think he's trying to whip up
support and make this Iraq versus the United States. Indeed, it is
Iraq versus the rest of the world. And I talked to leader after
leader after leader; talked at length to Helmut Kohl today, and
he's been making just that point and will continue to make that
point.
   But yes, I think there is some of that feeling, that as they
become isolated from their Arab brothers _ and they are _ and as
they become isolated from traditional trading partners _ and they
are _ there is a sense of irrational urgency there.
   Q: How seriously do you take his public threats?
   A: The United States won't be threatened.
   Q: Mr. President, the other day you called on Americans for
personal sacrifice, but you didn't really elaborate. Were you
talking about economic deprivation or were you ...
   A: No, I was not particularly talking about economic
deprivation. I'm think of families whose plans have been severely
altered by this. I'm thinking of more of that kind of thing when I
made the statement.
   Q: Are you preparing Americans for the possibility of war and
American deaths?
   A: I think any time you move American forces and any time you
are up against what most of the world now considers to be an
outrageous violator of international law, that the best thing is to
be prepared.
   Q: Mr. President, King Hussein today in Jordan suggested that
perhaps you moved too precipitously, in his words, that if there
had not been this buildup that we might not be in the situation
we're in and that Saddam Hussein might have withdrawn. Was there
ever any signals, anything that suggested that that might have been
in the case?
   A: No. And the king, regrettably, did not have much support in
the Arab world for that position. You recall the vote at the Arab
summit. He certainly had no support for that position in the United
Nations and as the United Nations moved toward Chapter 7.
   And I would simply remind people who hear that allegation that
it isn't just the United States, it's the rest of the world. But
when we are invited by a friend to help defend it against
aggression that has recently taken place and that threatens to take
place again, we're going to respond, and that's a good signal to
send to friends around the world.
   And I might say, the request for support was not taken without
reason. The Saudis were very much concerned _ and let me just
recite the history for the American people here. He had said,
Saddam Hussein had said, ``We're withdrawing.'' I believe it was on
a Sunday. And they had a picture of one truck, people frantically
waving goodbye to the beloved brothers in Kuwait as they went north.
   And at the same time, there was truckload after truckload of
armor and mechanized equipment moving south.
   Now, we're not dumb when we see that, nor are the Saudis, nor
are the other countries that are rejoicing, as Dick Cheney will
tell you, in the fact that we moved. But I think it's important to
keep reminding people of why the Saudis felt threatened and
probably today still feel threatened.

   Iraq claimed two unidentified aircraft
crossed from Saudi Arabia into Iraqi territory on Wednesday and
violated its airspace.
   Iraq's official news agency quoted an unidentified military
spokesman as saying, ``Two aircraft, coming from Saudi Arabia,
penetrated the southern Iraqi border, and ranged some five
kilometers (three miles) in Iraqi airspace.''
   The spokesman did not identify the planes, nor say whether they
were military aircraft. But Iraq's military spokesmen normally
report only on military activities.
   U.S. military forces, including aircraft and thousands of
personnel, have been in Saudi Arabia since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   The Iraqi spokesman said the overflight was reported at 11.04
a.m. Wednesday. He said the planes flew at an altitude of 36,000
feet, with their speed reported at 435 mph.
   In his short statement to the agency, monitored in Nicosia, the
spokesman did not say if the aircraft turned away voluntarily, or
were chased away by Iraq's air defenses or air force jets.
   It also could not be determined if the spokesman was referring
to a penetration of Iraq's own southern border with Saudi Arabia or
that of Kuwait. Iraq says Kuwait is now part of Iraq after its
invasion and subsequent annexation.
   No other details were immediately available.
   Last week, Iraq protested to the Ankara government the alleged
violation of Iraq's northern airspace by two Turkish planes.

<HEAD>New Park Sues Designer of Faulty Jaws, Earthquake Rides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Universal Studios Florida contends two
rides _ Jaws and Earthquake _ haven't worked properly since the
park opened in June and it's suing the company that designed them.
   Universal alleges that Ride &amp; Show Engineering Inc. of San
Dimas, Calif., used poor workmanship and design on the highly
touted attractions. Both have worked only sporadically since the
park opened June 7.
   Their fitful operation and problems with a third ride,
Kongfrontation, have forced the movie-theme park to offer a free
admission ticket for each one sold. Ride &amp; Show did not work on the
King Kong ride, which has computer glitches.
   Joseph B. McHugh, vice president of marketing and administration
at Ride &amp; Show Engineering, said his company will fight the lawsuit.
   ``We strongly disagree with Universal's claims,'' McHugh said
Tuesday. ``Except for the expense of litigation, we welcome the
chance to vindicate our company.''
   He said the company was considering a counterclaim against the
theme park.
   Ride &amp; Show handled the design and manufacture of Jaws,
including the design of its seven computer-operated sharks. It also
was responsible for key elements of Earthquake, including the main
subway train that gets trapped in a modernized version of the 1906
San Francisco earthquake.
   Universal spokesman Doug Binder would not comment on the lawsuit
filed in Tuesday in Orange County Circuit Court in Orlando.
   He said Jaws, Earthquake and Kongfrontation are currently in
technical rehearsal, meaning that they are sometimes in operation
and open to visitors.
   Signs at Universal's entrance tell visitors the three rides may
be closed down at certain times. For their inconvenience, visitors
can take advantage of the two-for-one ticket policy that has been
in effect since June 8.

   Ward Sims, a veteran Associated Press
writer whose career included stints as correspondent in Juneau and
Fairbanks and bureau chief in Anchorage, died Wednesday in Seattle.
He was 65.
   Sims, who retired in 1984 after more than three decades with the
news agency, had been flown to Seattle's Providence Medical Center
on Aug. 15 after suffering a heart attack at his home in Sitka.
   ``He had been doing very well,'' said his wife, Virginia.
``Suddenly things began to go downhill. He died peacefully and
quickly.''
   He spent his entire professional career with The Associated
Press, joining the agency in San Francisco in 1950 following his
graduation from Montana State University.
   Sims was born in Tacoma, Wash., and served in the Army in Europe
during World War II.
   Sims became correspondent in Tacoma in 1951 and later that year
transferred to Seattle. In 1960, he was assigned Alaska statehouse
correspondent in Juneau, assisted by his wife.
   In 1968, he transferred to the Philadelphia bureau and a year
later became a general desk editor in New York. He returned to
Alaska to open a Fairbanks bureau in 1977 and a year later became
chief of bureau in Anchorage.
   One of the biggest stories he covered was the 1964 earthquake
that devastated Anchorage, Valdez and other parts of south-central
Alaska. Sims was the AP's first reporter on the scene and he spent
weeks covering the disaster.
   His last byline for the news service was on a retrospective
article about the disaster which was published last year on the
earthquake's 25th anniversary.
   After his retirement Sims moved to Sitka, where he enjoyed
fishing and hunting and was active in the Rotary Club. He also was
a writing coach at the Juneau Empire.
   ``He's probably forgotten more than any of us will ever know
about AP style and reporting in general,'' said Carl Sampson,
managing editor of the Juneau Empire.
   ``But it went beyond that. We used Ward as a resource when we
had a difficult story. We'd call for ideas and suggestions. We
called him our Dutch uncle. Every newspaper needs someone like
him.''
   ``He was a super writer and a wonderful reporter,'' said Bill
Tobin, Sims' predecessor in Juneau and now editorial page editor of
The Anchorage Times.
   ``He was highly respected by everyone he dealt with.''
   In addition to his wife, Sims is survived by a son, Dixon, of
Fairbanks.

   Wind-driven fires that gutted at least
22 homes and forced thousands of Riviera vacationers to flee
continued to burn out of control Wednesday in southern France.
   In the Alpes-Maritime region that includes Nice, a 42-year-old
volunteer firefighter died when heat caused the tires of his
firetruck to explode, and the vehicle rolled over. Two others
firefighters were injured.
   Further east in the Var, 1,200 firefighters and 300 soldiers
battled flames that have destroyed at least 10 homes and consumed
more than 20,000 acres of dense brush native to the region the last
two days.
   The firefighters brought 150 trucks and seven aerial tankers to
battle the blaze, which broke out Tuesday near Collobrieres. A
nearby hamlet was evacuated for safety reasons.
   But the flames were still advancing on a front several miles
long Wednesday, pushed by high winds.
   Reinforcements arrived Wednesday from all over France and more
were expected Thursday as regional authorities declared a state of
emergency.
   The situation was equally bad in the Bouches-du-Rhone region
around this Mediterranean port. Two days of fires blackened 12,500
acres and destroyed 12 homes.
   One of the fires on the outskirts of Marseille on Tuesday forced
1,300 people to evacuate their homes.
   Another in the scenic port of Cassis, a popular tourist spot
like all the Riviera during August, destroyed 36 docked boats and
caused about 1,000 vacationers to seek refuge elsewhere.
   Firefighters brought the blazes near Cassis and Marseille under
control Wednesday.
   But others broke out near Nimes, Gemenos and
Saint-Jean-de-Gargulier to consume thousands more acres of brush.

<HEAD>One Defendant Gets Maximum Sentence in Bensonhurst Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A young man was sentenced Wednesday to the
maximum two and two-thirds to eight years in prison for his role in
the racially motivated slaying of a black teen-ager by a mob of
young whites.
   John Vento, 21, who was supposed to be the prosecution's star
witness until he backed out of a deal to cooperate, was convicted
July 3 on two counts of unlawful imprisonment and four counts of
menacing. He's been in jail since March, when he surrendered to FBI
agents in Ohio.
   After nine days of bitter deliberations that followed a weeklong
trial, a jury acquitted Vento of the most serious charge _
intentional murder _ but deadlocked over a second murder count and
a riot charge.
   Following the trial, Vento also was charged with second-degree
manslaughter.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens set a Sept. 17 trial date on the
unresolved charges. Vento is to be tried with a co-defendant,
Charles Stressler, who's also charged with second-degree murder.
   Four other whites are to be tried later in connection with the
killing of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins.
   The defendants are all young residents of the Bensonhurst
section, a mainly white and Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn.
Hawkins was murdered after he and three friends, all black
teen-agers, crossed paths with a white mob when they went to
Bensonhurst to look at a used car for sale.
   ``I want to say I'm very sorry for what happened,'' Vento told
the judge Wednesday, a day before the first anniversary of the
attack. ``When someone says something about sleepless nights, I
have many.''
   Outside the courtroom Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, said: ``I
don't accept his apology. ... Apologies don't mean anything for me.
He doesn't walk into Yusuf's room and see his clothes. He doesn't
have to look into Yusuf's mother's face and see the pain.''
   Owens sentenced Vento to one and one-third to four years on each
of the unlawful imprisonment counts and 90 days on each menacing
charge. He ruled the two imprisonment counts would run
consecutively with the penalties for menacing concurrently.
   Assistant District Attorney Pamela Hayes asked for the maximum
sentence, characterizing Vento as a troublemaker ``who has a
problem in following the laws of society.''
   The unprovoked attack that Vento helped organize traumatized not
only the victims and their families, but the entire city, Ms. Hayes
said.
   Shortly after the murder, Vento telephoned the district
attorney, said he was in the gang, saw what happened and agreed to
cooperate with the investigation in exchange for immunity from
prosecution.
   He voluntarily testified before a grand jury in September, but
around Christmas he fled New York. When he surfaced in Dayton,
Ohio, several months later Vento announced he was backing out of
his deal and would face prosecution.
   Vento was acquitted of intentionally murdering Hawkins,
discrimination and criminal possession of a weapon.
   The jurors were unable to reach a verdict on riot and a second
murder count, which charged Vento acted with ``depraved
indifference'' to human life.
   In May, Joseph Fama was convicted of murdering Hawkins. Keith
Mondello, the ringleader of the young whites, was acquitted of
murder and manslaughter charges, but convicted of riot, unlawful
imprisonment and other crimes.
   Owens sentenced both to the maximum of 32 and two-thirds to life
for Fama and five and one-third years to 16 years for Mondello.

   Iraq's radar systems, described by one expert as a
sophisticated ``mish-mash from all over,'' could pose the first
serious challenge to U.S. stealth aircraft, military analysts said
Wednesday.
   The U.S. Air Force sent 22 F-117A stealth fighters to the Middle
East Monday and experts said that even with the highly
sophisticated air armada assembling in the gulf, they could play an
important role.
   ``(Stealth) is a new system and it would be folly not to take
the opportunity to use it under operational conditions,'' said Don
Kerr, an aviation analyst with the International Institute for
Strategic Studies.
   The ungainly matte black jets, designed to penetrate radar
without detection, have seen combat only once _ during the U.S.
invasion of Panama in December 1989.
   Les Aspin, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed
Services Committee, dismissed the use of the high-tech
fighter-bomber in Panama as a Pentagon ploy to win support for the
expensive aircraft in Congress.
   One stealth plane in Panama dropped its bombs on a hill instead
of its intended target, but a Defense Department investigation
concluded the accident was caused by human error.
   Air Force Col. Anthony Tolin, until recently a stealth wing
commander, said this week that the presence of the F-117A stealth
planes in the gulf could be an important psychological weapon.
   Tolin is now assistant deputy chief of staff of the Tactical Air
Command at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.
   But stealth would face an Iraqi air defense system that military
analysts in London described as costly and up-to-date.
   ``Iraq's radar equipment is a mish-mash from all over, mostly
from the Soviet Union, but some from France and China,'' said Henry
Dodds, an aviation specialist with Jane's Defense Weekly.
   Dodds, who endorsed the U.S. decision to deploy stealth, said
Iraqi radar and air defense systems worked well during the
eight-year war with Iran. But, he said, the Iranian air force is
small, poorly trained and inexperienced.
   ``The Americans are a very different matter. I suspect the
Iraqis have never come up against electronic warfare before,'' said
Kerr.
   He said, however, Western forces should not be overconfident.
   ``It's not a question of sophistication. What you have to
remember in military matters is that the enemy only has to get
lucky once,'' Kerr said.
   The F-117A stealth fighters were built by Lockheed Co. at a
secret plant in Burbank, Ca.
   At $42.6 million per plane, not including research and
development costs, the fighters are one of the world's most
expensive. The U.S. Air Force says it has 56 of them.
   The stealth will operate alongside an impressive array of
fighter aircraft carrying some of the world's most sophisticated
electronic warfare equipment.
   The U.S. military buildup in the Middle East includes 48 F-15
fighters, an unspecified number of B-52 bombers, Airborne Warning
and Control System radar planes, F-16 fighters, A-10 attack jets,
and reconnaissance aircraft.
   Carrier-based air power totals at least 100 planes, while the
marines are taking 150 aircraft, including Harrier vertical takeoff
fighters and A6-E intruder bombers of the type used to attack Libya
in 1986.

   Some people sit on a ``sofa.'' Others may
call the same piece of furniture a ``davenport,'' a
``chesterfield'' or a ``settee.''
   Your word choice says something distinctive about your identity.
   ``The words we use and how we pronounce them make us special and
identifiable as part of a group,'' said William A. Kretzschmar, an
associate professor in the University of Georgia's English
department who has devoted his career to chronicling the
distinguishing features of the spoken word.
   ``Language marks us,'' he said. ``It gives us a sense of
community and culture.''
   Kretzschmar is editor-in-chief of two linguistic atlases that
will contain the results of 60 years of research on how Americans
talk in two regions of the country.
   The Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States
plots the use of language in 11 states stretching from New York to
northern Florida. The Linguistic Atlas of the North-Central States
covers six states from Michigan to Kentucky and parts of Ontario,
Canada.
   The first of the two volumes is expected to published within two
years, Kretzchmar said Wednesday.
   The atlases are part of a project to survey all of the United
States and Canada to document distinct areas of dialect.
   The project is an extension of research performed in the 1930s
and 1940s, when specially trained interviewers documented the
differences in speech among people in different parts of the
country.
   More than 1,200 people in 500 communities in the Southeast were
interviewed and recorded during that period.
   Depending upon where you live, you mmight call a mosquito-eating
insect commonly found in wet areas a ``skeeter hawk,'' ``snake
doctor'' or ``dragonfly.''
   And a device for carrying water might be a ``pail,'' ``bucket''
or ``piggin.''

   President Bush ordered the first mobilization
of reservists since the Vietnam War on Wednesday, declaring the
part-time soldiers ``essential to completing our mission'' of
opposing Iraq's Saddam Hussein in the Middle East.
   Officials said as many as 40,000 ``weekend warriors'' could be
in uniform by the end of the month.
   ``We continue to pursue our objectives with absolute
determination,'' Bush said of the Persian Gulf buildup.'' He spoke
at a news conference at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine,
after signing the order for the Pentagon to call up reservists.
   Officials declined to identify units that would be activated, or
to say when they would be called. But Army sources said some could
be called up within 24 hours of Bush's order.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, appearing alongside Bush after
returning from a six-country trip to the Persian Gulf, said he
would decide exactly how many reserves to call up after he meets
with the military service chiefs Thursday.
   In a further sign of the scope of the U.S. military buildup,
Bush also authorized Cheney to extend enlistment terms of
servicemen. The Pentagon said it had no immediate comment on how or
when it might use that authority.
   The call-up won quick support from the chairmen of the armed
services committees in both the House and Senate.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., called it an ``appropriate and essential
act,'' and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the action would give
military planners greater confidence in the availability of
reserves in future contingencies.
   The last time reserves were activated for military purposes was
1968 when 35,280 were called up by President Johnson following the
Tet offensive in Vietnam and the North Korean seizure of the U.S.
surveillance ship Pueblo. In 1970 President Nixon ordered a call-up
during a mail strike.
   Bush, meeting with Cheney and Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, at Kennebunkport, signed an executive order
that stated:
   ``I hereby determine that it is necessary to augment the active
armed forces of the United States for the effective conduct of
operational missions in and around the Arabian Peninsula.''
   Cheney and Powell had been expected to report to him that the
United States was approaching a target of 100,000 military
personnel in the region, said one source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement that ``the actual number of reserve personnel to be
called to active duty will depend upon the operational needs of the
armed forces'' in the gulf area.
   While not saying which reserve skills Bush wanted to tap,
Fitzwater noted that the reserves are an integral part of military
airlift, food and water handling, surface transportation, cargo
handling, medical services, construction and intelligence.
   A Pentagon statement said some reserves called to active duty
would be shipped to Saudi Arabia while others would remain on U.S.
shores replacing troops already dispatched to the Mideast.
   ``These reservists will support Operation Desert Shield by
joining active duty units deployed in and around the Arabian
Peninsula or by filling critical military support vacancies in the
United States or elsewhere,'' the statement said.
   An administration official said the Pentagon expected to call up
40,000 reservists ``between now and the end of August.''
   Short of declaring a national emergency, the president can
mobilize up to 200,000 of the nation's 1.2 million reservists for
as long as 180 days. It is up to the Pentagon to determine how the
total is divided among services.
   ``At this time we do not anticipate approaching the full 200,000
authority provided by law,'' Fitzwater said.
   While taking reservists from their normal jobs may be
disruptive, the Pentagon statement said, ``What must be emphasized
is that those who have been ordered to active duty are vital to our
national commitment in this operation.''
   The call to arms for America's civilian militia is the first
real test of the Pentagon's ability to field an effective fighting
force since it began shifting more wartime responsibility to the
reserves 17 years ago.
   After the draft was abolished in 1973, the Pentagon adopted a
``total force'' concept that moved many key tasks, such as supply
transport, medical services, and communications, away from the
professional soldiers to part-time civilian reservists.
   The change was designed to ensure that no sustained conflict
would be fought without the use of reserves. The idea was that
following the publicly unpopular Vietnam war, the White House would
be forced to measure national resolve early in any future military
crisis by bringing civilians into the fighting force.
   Reserves also are cheaper than active duty forces.
   With the money-saving element in mind, many in Congress have
urged that even more war-fighting responsibility be shifted to the
reserves as the United States shrinks and restructures its armed
forces in response to the end of the Cold War.
   Reserves are now integral to any large-scale military operation.
For example, more than half of the Army's combat forces and
two-thirds of its combat support and service support manpower are
in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve.
   The Navy Reserve maintains 93 percent of naval cargo handling
battalions, and the Air Force relies on reserves to man 92 percent
of strategic interceptor aircraft in the continental United States
and two-thirds of its medical evacuation crews.

<TEXT>
   For the fourth time, a citywide police dragnet
was being deployed in hopes of snaring the so-called Zodiac gunman.
   Three previous dragnets failed to catch the gunman who killed
one man and wounded three others in pre-dawn attacks between March
8 and June 21.
   ``I don't know whether we scared him off,'' Chief of Detectives
Joseph Borrelli said during a briefing Tuesday at police
headquarters.
   ``He's not a fool,'' the chief said of the gunman. ``He has to
assume that we have taken certain extraordinary measures in certain
particular areas. He didn't want to get caught so he went someplace
else.''
   The fourth dragnet was in anticipation of a possible attack
Thursday. The gunman, in the past, has attacked on Thursdays at
intervals of 21 or 63 days.
   The elusive gunman had vowed in rambling letters to police and
the media to shoot eight others, claiming a victim for each of the
12 astrological signs. So far, his victims have been a Scorpio, a
Taurus, a Gemini and a Cancer.
   Thursday was considered a key night by a task force of 50
detectives, because it was 63 days from the gunman's last attack,
June 21. It also could be significant because the astrological sign
of Virgo begins Thursday.
   Detectives on the Zodiac task force have followed up on nearly
2,000 leads, and eliminated about a dozen suspects. Each of the
three dragnets has cost the city $25,000 in overtime.
   Investigators have even checked fingerprints from the city
morgue against two partial prints found on the gunman's letters, in
an effort to determine whether the gunman had died.
   If the gunman eludes the dragnet again, the task force may be
reduced, Borrelli said.
   The gunman claims to be the same Zodiac who terrorized San
Francisco during the late 1960s and the early '70s, killing six
people. Police doubt that, but think he may be getting his ideas
from a book about the San Francisco attacks.

<HEAD>Jordan Closes Its Border With Iraq Despite Refugee Flood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HALABY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan, strained by the daily influx of
thousands of refugees fleeing from Iraq and occupied Kuwait,
announced Wednesday the closure of its northeastern border.
   The announcement of the midnight closure (5 p.m. EDT) of
Jordan's border with Iraq came shortly after King Hussein said
42,000 foreigners escaping Iraq and Kuwait crossed into Jordan
during the day. That is the largest number since the Persian Gulf
crisis began Aug. 2 with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The announcement from Interior Minister Salem Msadeh said the
border was being closed because of ``concern for the health
situation of the arrivals and to ensure suitable arrangements for
their stay in Jordan.
   ``Until we provide them with suitable shelter, we find ourselves
obliged to close the Jordanian border for the foreign arrivals from
Iraq as of midnight Wednesday.''
   Transportation here is limited, and people jam air terminals,
the port and highways. Mosques, hospitals, schools and other public
buildings have been pressed into makeshift accomodations for the
masses, many of whom were left penniless when Kuwaiti banks
suddenly closed after the takeover.
   Jordan's Hussein said earlier Wednesday that his country may
have to ``slow down the process'' of receiving them because of the
strain the influx is causing.
   Hussein said during a news conference that about 185,000 people
of various nationalities have flooded the kingdom the last three
weeks.
   A senior security official said Jordan has asked Iraq to
decrease the flow of people. The official said most of the refugees
had entered Jordan through the Ruweishid border post 210 miles
northeast of the capital, Amman.
   Many are driven across Jordan in bus and truck convoys escorted
by police to the Syrian or Saudi border the same day of their
arrival. Others leave through charter flights from Amman's two
airports.
   Egyptians are the largest single group of foreigners fleeing
Kuwait and Iraq. Though 54,000 Egyptians have already passed
through Jordan, more than 25,000 have been stuck in the bottleneck
of their only exit point, Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba.

   Unlike many other events that have briefly
depressed Wall Street's markets in recent years, the showdown in
the Persian Gulf keeps driving down stock prices weeks after it
first hit the headlines.
   One reason for this persistence, analysts say, is its timing.
When Iraq invaded Kuwait, the news intensified recession worries
that were already mounting fast in the financial world.
   A second, more emotional, factor has been the unhappy memories
the crisis has evoked of the dreary investment climate that
prevailed for so long in the 1970s when trouble erupted in the
Middle East.
   As measured by the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, the
stock market topped out at a record closing high of 2,999.75 in
mid-July, more than two weeks before Iraq pulled off its surprise
attack Aug. 2.
   From that peak through Wednesday's close, the average fell
439.60 points, or 14.6 percent, to its lowest level in more than
six months.
   Through late July the market dropped as economists debated
whether a much-heralded ``soft landing'' in business activity was
turning into something more disruptive.
   When the hostilities flared in Kuwait, sending oil prices
soaring, a good many analysts who had taken the ``no-recession''
view began to switch sides.
   ``Iraq caught both us and the world totally off guard in its
Kuwaiti invasion,'' observes Edward Nicoski at the Minneapolis
investment firm of Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. ``Yet the storm
clouds were hovering weeks earlier over Wall Street.
   ``It is interesting how the market can foreshadow real-life
events.''
   Among all the numbers that dictate the moods of Wall Street, the
most dramatic change has been in the price of oil _ from around $16
a barrel at the beginning of the summer to more than $31 as of
Wednesday.
   This surge dashed investors' hopes that the Federal Reserve
would see enough encouraging evidence on inflation to justify
adopting a stimulative monetary policy that would foster lower
interest rates.
   It also conjured up visions of ``stagflation'' _ a term coined
in the 1970s to describe a combination of high inflation and
stagnant economic activity.
   In some schools of economic thought, these two problems were
once considered almost mutually exclusive. But they came together
in the oil shocks of both 1973 and 1979.
   Those conditions, in turn, bore a large share of the blame for a
generally poor performance by the stock market throughout the '70s.
   The market's woes grew especially acute in the fall of 1973,
when members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
declared an embargo on oil shipments to the United States.
   Over a span of less than two months, from Oct. 12 through Dec. 5
of that year, the Dow Jones industrial average fell from 978.63 to
788.31, or 19.5 percent. Further sharp declines followed in a bear
market that lasted for another year.
   Many economists have hastened to declare that today's situation
differs greatly from the setting in which those events unfolded.
For one thing, they say, industrial countries have markedly reduced
their relative reliance on oil to fuel their economies.
   For another, world politics have changed dramatically, so that a
nation such as Iraq in a militant position cannot readily play
communist and capitalist powers off against each other the way it
once might have done.
   Nevertheless, say some analysts, the stock market cares most
about economics, and it is now groping for a new level that
reflects a gloomier outlook for investors, consumers, workers and
business planners.
   ``The economy continues to limp along the edges of recession,''
said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International in New York.
   ``The Mideast crisis and all its ramifications reinforced the
emerging consensus that things are more likely to get worse before
they get better.''

<HEAD>Hussein Warns of Escalation in Conflict, Announces New Mission</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New thruout to recast lead, UPDATES with Jordan announcing
closing of border because of flood of foreigners. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   King Hussein warned Wednesday that any
escalation of Persian Gulf conflict could have a ``devastating
effect'' and said he will embark on a new round of talks with Arab
leaders to defuse it.
   ``I still believe there is a chance to resolve the problem,''
Hussein said at a news conference.
   The king also told reporters the flood of refugees entering
Kuwait from Iraq and Kuwait had severely strained Jordan's
resources. Hours later, Jordan announced that because of the
influx, it was closing its northeastern border with Iraq, shutting
one of the few escape routes left for foreigners fleeing that
country.
   The closure took effect at midnight (5 p.m. EDT), according to a
government announcement.
   Hussein hinted at the closure during his news conference, saying
the influx of refugees since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait was
so great Jordan may have to ``slow the process.''
   Speaking in the palace to a room crowded with journalists,
Hussein said he believed ``we are almost facing a crisis of the
world gone mad.'' He declined to say where he would go or with whom
he would meet when he begins his new peace mission.
   Published reports say the king's position revolves around three
principles _Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the
Kuwaiti ruling family to power, and negotiations in an ``Arab
context'' to resolve the Iraq-Kuwait dispute.
   About 200 Jordanian women carrying banners and singing patriotic
songs marched on the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday, demanding the
United States withdraw its troops from Saudi Arabia and lift the
economic embargo on Iraq.
   Such protests, an almost daily occurrence in Jordan, reflect the
predominantly pro-Iraqi feeling of Jordanians, half of whom are
either of Palestinian origin or from the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   In part because of popular sentiment in favor of Iraq, King
Hussein has still not committed himself fully to upholding U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
   Another consideration is that Jordan depends heavily on trade
with its neighbor through the Red Sea port at Aqaba. Sanctions
would add to the kingdom's economic woes.
   Asked whether he was siding with his close ally, Iraq, or with
the United States in the conflict, he said: ``My country is not
siding with anyone but itself and with the Arab people and its
hopes and aspirations.''
   Any escalation of the conflict ``would have a devastating effect
on this region and the world,'' he said.
   The king added that he did not believe Iraq planned further
expansion.
   ``I believe that as far as you can tell, Iraq is holding a fully
defensive posture and I have the impression that the Arab forces
arrayed against Iraq in the area are in a defensive posture,''
Hussein said.
   Hussein said his country was seeking to clarify with the United
Nations what trade with Iraq is barred by the U.N. resolution
ordering sanctions against Iraq.
   ``There is an area of ambiguity that we have been trying to
clarify with the U.N. as to what an embargo means, what is
permitted to flow and what is not permitted to flow. And hopefully
this will be clarified,'' he said.
   Pressed by reporters about what trade might be conducted under
the sanctions, he replied: ``I don't know ... medicines,
foodstuffs, these details are not clear.''

<HEAD>Peace Talks Deadlock, Salvadoran Rebels Warn of Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran government and guerrilla
negotiators ended six days of U.N.-mediated peace talks on
Wednesday deadlocked in what one participant called ``a dialogue of
the deaf'' over the future of the military.
   Each side accused the other of intransigence.
   Rebel chiefs said the stalemate made escalation of the war
imminent.
   Another round was set for Sept. 13 in San Jose.
   The two sides agreed this year to pursue accords permitting a
mid-September cease-fire. U.N. mediator Alvaro DeSoto acknowledged,
as delegation members did earlier, that absence of agreement here
made that virtually impossible.
   Rebel delegate Salvador Samayoa said, ``Escalation of military
action is almost inevitable as a result of the government's
intransigence and the absence of progress.
   ``We're speaking two different languages. It is a dialogue of
the deaf.'' Francisco Mena, a senior guerrilla field commander,
said, ``The picture is this: we're getting nowhere in negotiations,
so let's have at it with the irons.''
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the insurgent
army known as the FMLN, submitted an 18-point document. The first
demand is for ``total demilitarization of society, by means of
disappearance of the two armies.''
   The conservative administration of President Alfredo Cristiani,
backed by the United States, says it is willing to ``restructure,''
reform and reduce the armed forces, but not to abolish them.
   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, the chief government
delegate, characterized the rebel position expressed in San Jose as
``a setback'' from the position advanced last month.
   Army Col. Mauricio Vargas, also a government negotiator, termed
the new document ``a low blow.''
   The nearly 11-year-old civil war has killed an estimated 72,000
people, most of them civilians.
   The FMLN insists that military impunity for widespread violation
of human rights end. International rights organizations have blamed
the military and military-linked death squads in the deaths of up
to 30,000 suspected opponents in the past 10 years. But not one
officer has been tried for such a crime.
   The rebels demand a purge of the high command to ensure
subordination to civilian authority and guard against abuses by a
reformed security force.
   The FMLN proposes that a civilian-led police force be created to
take the place of the army, following the lead of Costa Rica.
   Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949. It is the only Central
American land that has enjoyed peace, relative prosperity and
democracy in recent decades.
   In previous talks, the rebels demanded trial and punishment of
officers implicated in four notorious human rights cases, including
the 1980 assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero and last
November's massacre by soldiers of six Jesuit priest-educators,
their housekeeper and her daughter.
   The new document adds demands for punishment of those
responsible for two other cases, and for ``murders, massacres and
bombardments of civilians that have occurred during the
negotiation.'' It seeks investigations to determine responsibility
for 20 other specific crimes in addition to ``all the crimes,
murders, disappearances and massacres committed since 1979.''
   ``Our position may appear to be maximalist. But this is what is
needed to create a new society,'' said Mena, a former army captain
who switched sides in 1981.
   The rebels last November launched the war's biggest offensive
and say they are prepared to make another major military push.
Rebel sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say they are now
better prepared to counter government air power because they have
acquired dozens of anti-aircraft missiles.
   The insurgents say they bought the missiles on the black market.
Army and Western intelligence sources suspect at least some of the
missiles were provided by Sandinista military commanders in
Nicaragua, or donated by Cuba.
   This was the fourth round of talks that began in Venezuela in
May. Negotiations to date produced one accord _ on human rights _
signed last month.

<TEXT>
   It's no joke: Texas voters may get a chance
to put Bart Simpson in the Legislature.
   It isn't Bart Simpson, the underachieving cartoon character.
It's Bart Simpson the 24-year-old businessman.
   Businessman Bart told Bexar County Republican Party officials
this week he'd like to run for the District 115 House seat.
   Nobody entered the GOP primary last spring for the seat, long
held by Democrats. Party officials are checking to see if they can
nominate a candidate for the general election.
   Bart, the would-be politician, quips his campaign might get a
boost from Bart, the star of TV's ``The Simpsons.''
   ``I do have a name that people would recognize,'' said Simpson,
who works for a company that makes construction loans. But he
hastened to add: ``I've wanted to be a state representative since I
was in high school.''
   Simpson said he's unsure how he'd list his name on the ballot.
   ``I've gone by Bart my entire life,'' he said, but added that he
might adopt his full name, Barton, to head off cowabunga gibes.
   Steven Heinrich, executive director of the Bexar County
Republican Party, said Simpson almost got laughed off the line when
he called party officials Monday to say he was interested in
running.
   ``Everyone thought it was a joke,'' Heinrich said. But the party
is taking Simpson seriously, at least some of the time.
   ``If the Democrats can put up Gene Kelly, we can run Bart
Simpson,'' said Heinrich.
   The Gene Kelley who isn't a dancer is a San Antonio lawyer _ and
the surprise winner of the Democratic primary for a Texas Supreme
Court nomination.

   Soviet military experts continue to train Iraqi
soldiers to use their Soviet-built weapons three weeks after Moscow
cut weapons supplies to protest the invasion of Kuwait, officials
said Wednesday.
   The revelation appeared to open cracks in what had been
unprecedented U.S-Soviet unity in the 3-week-old Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Col. Valentin Ogurtsov said 193 unarmed military experts were
finishing their ``contractual obligations'' to show Iraqis how to
use state-of-the art tanks, jet fighters and missiles, and to
maintain and repair the hardware.
   Ogurtsov and Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh
insisted the experts were not advising President Saddam Hussein's
government and were not involved in military operations.
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Gremitskikh has
maintained he did not know what the military experts were doing in
the Arab nation.
   Confirmation they were still working came only hours after
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov ordered all Soviet agencies
to sever commercial ties with Iraq to comply with U.N. sanctions.
   The Soviet Union sold more than half the weapons Baghdad bought
between 1982 and 1989.
   The day after the invasion of Kuwait, the Soviet Union halted
arms supplies to Iraq, its long-time ally, and Ogurtsov said
Wednesday one shipment was stopped in transit. On the same day,
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III signed a rare joint statement condemning Iraq's attack
on its oil-rich neighbor.
   But the revelations Wednesday, and reports from the United
Nations that the Soviets were slowing efforts to get U.N. approval
for military force to enforce economic sanctions, appeared to
undercut the initial appearance of unity.
   At a news conference in Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush
said he was not familiar with the report on the Soviet military
advisers. He said he had no argument with the Soviet response to
the Persian Gulf crisis. ``At this point, I would say we are
getting superb cooperation from the Soviets,'' Bush said.
   In Moscow, meanwhile, Gremitskikh and Ogurtsov fended off
questions for more than an hour about whether the military experts'
continuing work violated the U.N. economic embargo or the Soviet
order.
   ``Don't single out the Soviet Union,'' Gremitskikh said. ``I
don't think this presence of a very small number of military and
technical experts ... runs counter to the United Nations'
position.''
   He said nationals from other countries continued to work in Iraq
but did not identify their professions or their countries.
   Gremitskikh said that when the contracts expire, the military
experts will leave and will not be replaced. Ogurtsov said the
contracts ranged from 10 days to one year.
   The colonel said that when the Soviet government contracted to
sell weapons to Iraq, it also agreed ``we would send technical
experts to help the Iraqi military to learn how to use the arms
supplied.''
   ``We supply the new type of weapons, and if the local personnel
is not acquainted with such a weapon, our expert goes there and
teaches the method of using that type of weapon,'' he said.
   ``At the present time, they work not only in training centers,
but on test ranges. Suppose we supplied a new type of tank. It has
new, unknown capabilities to the local personnel, so we build a
kind of test range to test it. ... This is the kind of activity
they are involved in.''
   Ogurtsov, asked why military experts were not recalled as part
of the Soviet arms embargo, said: ``It's not for me to say. ... The
decisions are taken not by us, but at the political level.''
   The military experts were among 7,791 Soviets stranded in Iraq,
which closed its borders after the invasion. In all, 21,000
foreigners were caught in Iraq and Kuwait, including 3,000
Americans, who have not been allowed to leave.
   Gremitskikh said Soviet women and children would begin to be
evacuated on Sunday, after the last of the 882 Soviets caught in
Kuwait had left. He suggested Iraq would then allow Soviet men to
leave.
   The Soviets have not said how many of the 7,791 are men.
Ogurtsov said many of the civilians were involved in oil drilling,
research and other aspects of the oil industry.
   The Foreign Ministry has said the figure includes workers in
energy and other industries, businessmen, diplomats and their
dependents. It has denied reports that the Soviet Union has
thousands of military advisers in Iraq.
   Also Wednesday, a special envoy from Saudi Arabia arrived in
Moscow, carrying a letter for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The
two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
   Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington,
was instrumental in establishing diplomatic relations between Saudi
Arabia and China.
   His arrival follows the visit of Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Saadoun Hammadi, who met with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
on Monday and Tuesday.

   A slow-moving weather system continued to drop rain into already
sodden ground from the Ohio Valley into the middle Atlantic states
Wednesday.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the southern Ohio
Valley to northern Florida and the central Gulf Coast Wednesday
afternoon, while showers extended across the middle Atlantic Coast
states.
   Up to 2 inches of rain fell Wednesday in parts of West Virginia,
forcing some evacuations in Wayne County. Minor flooding also
occurred in parts of Lincoln and Wood counties.
   Floods were possible in southeastern Ohio, and the mountains and
northern foothills of North Carolina.
   In western North Carolina, Asheville was soaked with 4.55 inches
of rain during the 24 hours up to 8 a.m. EDT Wednesday, and
Piketon, Ohio reported 2.47 inches.
   Showers and thunderstorms formed during the afternoon over the
southern Rockies and the central High Plains region.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were over the western Gulf Coast
region, southern Arkansas and southeast Oklahoma, and western Iowa.
   Mostly sunny skies allowed temperatures to soar into the 90s
Wednesday afternoon in the southern Plains and the lower
Mississippi Valley, while showers kept readings in the 60s along
middle Atlantic Coast.
   Mild weather prevailed across the Northwest with temperatures
mostly in the 60s and 70s at midday. Readings soared into the 90s
and above 100 degrees in the desert Southwest, and sunny skies
allowed temperatures to warm very rapidly in the Great Basin.
   Ely, Nev., which tied Truckee, Calif., as cold spot in the Lower
48 states with a morning low of 34 degrees, was up to 70 by midday.
   Temperatures dipped into the 50s from the upper Mississippi
Valley to New England, with morning lows in the 40s in northern
Michigan and northern New England.
   Temperatures also dipped into the 40s and 50s in the Rocky
Mountain and Colorado Plateau region, with readings in the 30s
reported at some locations.

<HEAD>Gingrich, Abandoning Bush, Calls for Tax Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, the No. 2 House
Republican, parted with the Bush administration Wednesday in saying
he will propose a tax-cut package when budget talks resume next
month.
   Gingrich renewed his criticism of the idea of raising some taxes
to fight the federal deficit, a concept President Bush accepted
last June in a reversal of his oft-repeated opposition to new taxes.
   Gingrich, R-Ga., said that with a weakening U.S. economy
threatened even further by the Persian Gulf crisis, the priority
for budget bargainers should be to adopt policies that would help
the country avoid a recession.
   ``I'd find it very hard to understand an argument for a tax
increase in the face of a weak economy,'' Gingrich told reporters.
He said that tax cuts stimulating the economy must be part of any
deficit-reduction package.
   Gingrich, one of the budget negotiators, also criticized
Democrats in general and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, in particular in connection with the budget talks.
   He cited Democratic failure to propose a deficit-reduction plan
at this year's budget negotiations and the opposition of many
Democratic lawmakers to Bush's effort to cut the capital gains tax
rate.
   ``They're following a strategy of taking the risk that Americans
will be put out of work for the political advantage of the
Democratic Party,'' Gingrich said.
   He said there is now a danger of a recession, ``which frankly I
believe Senator Mitchell has frankly been planning for and which I
think his behavior has clearly helped lead to.''
   A spokeswoman for Mitchell declined to comment on Gingrich's
remarks.
   White House officials and congressional leaders have been trying
to hammer out a package of $50 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts for next year and $500 billion over five years.
   Their negotiations, which started in May, have produced no
agreements. The bargainers plan to resume their efforts as Congress
returns from recess next month.
   Gingrich said he was considering a package of tax cuts worth
perhaps $10 billion to $15 billion that he will propose when budget
talks resume next month.
   ``It will be clearly, dramatically less expensive than a
recession,'' Gingrich said of the tax-cut package.
   He said the proposal may include reducing the capital gains tax
rate, providing tax breaks for first-time home buyers, and
dramatically boosting the personal exemption allowed on income tax.
   He is also considering proposing cutting the Social Security
payroll tax, setting up new IRAs, and providing more tax breaks for
manufacturers, he said.
   The lawmaker said he was discussing his plan with other
Republicans and with the White House.

<TEXT>
   Marchers clad in skimpy lingerie marched
through the capital Wednesday, demanding the city be declared an
``erotic play zone'' free of ``repressive'' laws requiring clothing.
   Carrying with banners bearing slogans such as ``Lace Makes Men
Sexy,'' the 12 men and three women marchers shouted ``bodies are
beautiful'' and ``look who's wearing costumes here.''
   Parade organizer Fred Wagforth _ dressed in white panties, a
garter and fishnet stockings _ urged the 400 spectators to ``take
off their clothes'' and ``be all genders now.''
   ``Society creates authoritarian dualism between males and
females. We want to experiment with gender roles and open up new
terrain for ourselves,'' Wagforth said.
   A ``lingerie liberator'' clad in a women's slip and lace jacket
challenged men in the audience to prove they weren't wearing men's
underwear by taking off their pants.
   A spectator, moved by Wagforth's statement, stripped to his
underwear and joined the throng, saying marching would allow him to
``get a better tan.''
   ``I think it's a fun idea. I think people are afraid of their
bodies,'' Don Peterson said.
   Besides the demand for an erotic zone, Wagforth told city
officials that police should carry sexual accessories rather than
weapons.
   ``People need to stop the repressive institution of democracy in
America,'' Wagforth said.
   Two men, one dressed in a women's bra and panties and another in
a lace outfit led the march, carrying a sign that said ``March for
erotic action. Take your desires for reality.''
   About 20 police officers monitored the event, directing traffic
and following the group as they marched on the sidewalks and
shouted to observers to take off their clothes and join them. A few
people snapped pictures as the group passed.
   Duane Tessmer, who watched from the sidelines, said he thought
the group had a statement to make, but were ``going about it the
wrong way.''
   ``They're screwed up. They're doing this for their own greed of
walking around in clothes like that,'' he said.

   Donnita Cole knows how to wait.
   She has acquired the art of patience through three decades of
fearing for her husband, an overseas oil worker familiar with
quamires like the one that has trapped him in the Middle East.
   Since the 1960s, John Cole of Odessa, Texas, has endured a coup
in Libya, an attempted coup in Indonesia, two Nigerian revolutions
and one in Iran.
   Now the 50-year-old employee of Houston-based OGE Drilling Co.
is among about 3,000 U.S. citizens detained three weeks after
Iraq's Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The Persian Gulf crisis is for the Cole family yet another in a
string of crises.
   ``He's not an adventurer. He's just trying to make the best
living he knows how to for me and the kids,'' Mrs. Cole, 48, said
in a telephone interview Wednesday from Odessa.
   And there's more. While Mrs. Cole is wearing a yellow ribbon for
her missing husband, she is also flying an American flag in front
of her home as a reminder of family members on military standby.
   Her 22-year-old twin sons, both Army combat specialists, and a
son-in-law with the Air Force are waiting to find out whether
they'll be sent to the gulf. One of the sons, whose names Mrs. Cole
won't reveal, was sent with the U.S. troops to Panama in December.
   ``We've never really thought about it, but we have not led a
dull life,'' Mrs. Cole said. ``But as far as going out and looking
for excitement, we haven't. It's just that it's happened to us.''
   During the Iranian revolution, Cole escaped from an offshore rig
by boat and ended up in Bahrain. Mrs. Cole, who was living in
Malta, spent nine days without word from her husband, listening to
tales of atrocities from fleeing refugees.
   That decade-old experience helped prepare her for this one, she
said.
   ``It hasn't made it easier, but it's helping me handle it
better. It is never easy to handle anything like this,'' she said.
   ``You learn how to wait. And I am not a patient person _ not at
all.''
   Mrs. Cole was planning to join her husband in Kuwait Aug. 15.
   Instead, she is waiting for news from her husband. A network of
families with relatives either deployed or held in the Middle East
are helping her sort through fears, both as a hostage's wife and as
a military mother.
   ``I think two different sets of thoughts. Sometimes they fit
together, and sometimes they don't,'' she said.
   But for now, she said, the whole family is focusing on seeing
John Cole come home. She said even one of her two daughters, whose
husband is on standby in the Air Force, is preoccupied first with
her father's welfare.
   ``Right now she's just worried about her daddy. We're just
taking it one step at a time,'' Mrs. Cole said.
   ``Of course she's worried about her husband and her brothers.
But right now, they're not there yet. We don't mean to be
unfeeling, but we've got to have our worry priorities in order.''

   Jordan closed its border with Iraq at
midnight Wednesday as the country found itself unable to handle the
flood of tens of thousands of refugees fleeing Iraq and Kuwait.
   The announcement of the border closure came just hours after
King Hussein told a nationally televised news conference that
42,000 foreigners had entered Jordan on Wednesday _ the largest
number of arrivals in a single day since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait.
   Interior Minister Salem Masdeh said Jordan's northeast border
with Iraq would close at midnight Wednesday (5 p.m. EDT).
   Msadeh said the border was being closed because of ``concern for
the health situation of the arrivals and to ensure suitable
arrangements for their stay in Jordan.''
   ``Until we provide them with suitable shelter, we find ourselves
obliged to close the Jordanian border for the foreign arrivals from
Iraq as of midnight Wednesday,'' he said.
   At his nationally televised news conference, King Hussein said
his country is heavily burdened by the flood of refugees.
   ``On the human level we have some serious problems,'' the
Jordanian monarch said.
   ``We may have to slow down the process of receiving more people
unless we can speed up the movement of people to their respective
destinations,'' Hussein said. ``We are trying our very best to
provide food and shelter and medical facilities.''
   The number of arrivals Wednesday easily exceeded the huge influx
of 30,000 foreigners who entered Jordan on Friday. A Jordanian
security official said most of the refugees had arrived in the last
10 days.
   Hussein said about 185,000 refugees have crossed into Jordan
since Aug. 2, and only 67,000 of them have moved on to other
destinations. The overwhelming majority of arrivals have been Arab
and Asian nationals, about 40 percent of them Egyptians.
   Of the nearly 120,000 refugees who remain in Jordan, he said:
``We are finding enormous difficulty in meeting the needs of these
people or in arranging adequate modes of transport for them to
leave Jordan.''
   Transportation is limited in this poor country, and people jam
air terminals, the port of Aqaba and highways. Mosques, hospitals,
schools and other public buildings have been pressed into makeshift
accommodations.
   Hussein said six refugees have died in Jordan _ two adults and
four children _ but he did not say how they died.
   Security officials earlier had said a number of people died of
heat exhaustion or sunstroke after the arduous overland journey
through the desert from Kuwait and Iraq.
   A senior security official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Jordan has asked Iraq to decrease the flow of people. The
official said most of the refugees had entered Jordan through the
Ruweishid border post 210 miles northeast of Amman.
   Many of the refugees were left penniless when Kuwaiti banks
suddenly closed after the Aug. 2 takeover.
   ``I have spent 12 years of my life working in Kuwait and saving
my money for the future, and I ended up losing all of it,'' said
Ahmad Mohammad Saleh, a laborer from Yemen who was staying at a
mosque. ``All my efforts and hard work were wasted,'' he said in
tears.
   Many are driven across Jordan in bus and truck convoys escorted
by police to the Syrian or Saudi border the same day of their
arrival. Others leave through charter flights from Amman's two
airports.
   Egyptians are the largest single group of foreigners fleeing
Kuwait and Iraq. Though 54,000 Egyptians have already passed
through Jordan, more than 25,000 have been stuck in the bottleneck
of their only exit point, Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba.
   They are waiting in cars and buses or under the blazing desert
sun for space on the Egyptian ferries that can handle only about
3,000 people daily.
   Egyptian Ambassador Mahab Muqbel said Wednesday his government
had begun an airlift to relieve the congestion and would increase
the number of ferries.
   Israel offered to allow Egyptians overland passage from Aqaba
through a 10-mile strip of Israeli territory. The strip forms a
wedge at the top of the gulf of Aqaba between Jordanian and
Egyptian land. Egypt rejected the offer.
   The congestion at Aqaba is duplicated on a smaller scale in some
parts of the capital. Hotels in Amman are full, the airport is
jammed and the embassies of most Asian and African countries are
besieged.
   The minister of religious affairs, Ali Faqir, ordered all
mosques in the country to provide shelter and food for the
foreigners. Jordanian charitable organizations are distributing
thousands of free meals.
   The security official said in an interview that government
records showed that 193 American citizens as well as 38 Britons had
crossed at Ruweishid since Aug. 7. He said almost all were Arabs
with dual nationality.
   The Iraqi government is preventing the departure of an estimated
20,000 Westerners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait and intends to use
them to deter possible attacks on strategic points such as military
installations.

   From his vacation retreat in Wyoming,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III sought the help of the Soviet
Union Wednesday in enforcing a worldwide economic blockade of Iraq.
   The response he got from Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
on the telephone was a request for a slowdown at the United
Nations, U.S. officials told The Associated Press.
   But, they said, Shevardnadze did not threaten a Soviet veto or
any other means to stop the United States from seeking approval of
a military blockade.
   In fact, the officials said, the Soviets are using their close
ties to Iraq to urge the release of Westerners, including
Americans, trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   In any event, the Bush administration asserts it already has
legal authority to enforce the embargo _ with or without a new U.N.
resolution.
   The Security Council, by a vote of 13-0, approved the embargo
Aug. 6 and by unanimous vote on Aug. 9 declared Iraq's annexation
of Kuwait ``void.''
   Baker went to Wyoming on vacation last week, leaving Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger in charge at the State
Department.
   The veteran U.S. diplomat was at the White House Sunday night
advising President Bush on the Gulf crisis and again was at his
side Wednesday in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   At the same time, Baker has kept a hand in. He talks frequently
to Bush by telephone as well as to other senior officials,
including Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security
adviser.
   The Soviets supported Bush from the outset on economic sanctions
as a way of trying to compel Iraq to reverse its occupation of
Kuwait. Bush on Wednesday described Soviet cooperation as
``superb.''
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher on Tuesday called it
``excellent.''
   Soviet support is critical. As a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council the Soviets could block any resolution with a
veto. And Moscow has had a long and warm relationship with Iraq.
   Even though the Soviets ordered a cutoff in weapons shipments,
Soviet military experts continue to train Iraqi soldiers in using
Soviet-manufactured weapons.
   U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Moscow
had given Washington assurances no advisers had assisted the Iraqis
in their assault on Kuwait.
   And yet, the officials said, the Soviets gave the same
assurances about Iraq's eight-year war with Iran and still were
detected within range of the fighting.
   The topic did not come up in Baker's conversation with
Shevardnadze, they said. Instead, they talked mostly about the
situation at the United Nations.
   The Soviets want to let a certain period of time to pass before
adopting a resolution calling for a military blockade, the
officials said.
   One reason is the presence in Moscow of a senior Iraqi diplomat,
Deputy Prime Minister Sadun Hammadi. He has met with Shevardnadze,
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Igor Belonsov, who is overseeing
the evacuation of Soviet citizens from the Gulf.
   The Soviets would like to wait at least until Hammadi concludes
his visit before approving a military blockade, the officials said.
   ``I don't think we are in serious disagreement,'' a U.S.
official said. ``But the Soviets are hesitant to move as quickly as
we'd like to in enforcing the sanctions. They are not working
against us, but we are looking for their support, not just their
acquiescence.''

   President Bush said Wednesday the
United States could stop Iraqi shipping in the Persian Gulf ``right
now'' but was weighing how much time to give the United Nations to
take further action backing up economic sanctions against Iraq.
   Bush, flanked by top military and national security advisers,
answered questions on the Mideast crisis at his vacation home after
signing an order calling up U.S. reserves for military duty for the
first time since the Tet offensive in the Vietnam War.
   The president praised his military chiefs for the smoothness of
the massive U.S. military buildup in the Saudi Arabian desert and
the gulf waters, saying the Pentagon had deployed the equivalent of
``a medium-sized American city.''
   He then went back inside for more consultations with his
national security team, including discussion of whether to give
``the United Nations more time to take more productive action.''
   Asked about Iraqi tankers that failed to stop despite U.S.
warships' warning shots, Bush said, ``I think we've made clear to
shipping that they can be stopped and we have the forces to stop
them right now.''
   At the United Nations, the five permanent Security Council
members considered a resolution authorizing military force to back
up sanctions against Iraq but reached no agreement on the
precedent-setting proposal.
   In Washington, U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity
said Secretary of State James A. Baker III had sought the help of
the Soviet Union in enforcing a worldwide economic blockade of Iraq.
   But Baker, who telephoned Shevardnadze from Wyoming where the
secretary was vacationing, was asked in turn by Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze to slow down U.S. efforts at the U.N., the
officials said.
   Bush made clear that international backing was important, saying
repeatedly that the United States was not standing alone against
Iraq.
   ``This is not a matter between Iraq and the United States of
America; it is between Iraq and the entire world community, Arab
and non-Arab alike,'' he said. ``We are not in this alone; we stand
shoulder to shoulder right there in the Middle East with the armed
forces of 22 other nations.''
   Asked if his recent comments and actions were meant to prepare
people for the possibility of war and the loss of American lives,
Bush said:
   ``I think any time you move American forces and any time you are
up against what most of the world now considers to be an outrageous
violator of international law, that the best thing is to be
prepared.''
   On other Mideast subjects:
   _ Bush was asked how constrained he felt by the 3,000 Americans
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, including some taken by the Iraqi army
to vital military sites. He said, ``Any decision-maker in the
United States or in any of these countries is concerned about the
lives of innocent civilians, innocent people. You weigh that very
thoroughly against your actions.'' But he added that the U.N.
sanctions ``must be enforced.''
   _ He declined to answer when asked about a report that the
Soviet Union still had 193 military advisers in Iraq despite the
United Nations embargo Moscow has supported.
   ``At this point, I would say we are getting superb cooperation
from the Soviets,'' he said, noting that Baker had talked earlier
in the day with Shevardnadze.
   _ Bush said the United States would not comply with Iraq's order
to shut down the American Embassy in Kuwait City by Friday, and he
doubted other nations would, either. The State Department announced
earlier it would draw down all but essential diplomatic staff.
   He said the occupation of Kuwait ``is illegal under
international law and other countries agree totally that we must
not take the position that this illegal regime can shut down
legitimate embassies as a result of their aggression.''
   He said the U.S. embassies in Iraq and Kuwait would provide safe
haven to Americans who managed to reach them.
   _ Bush said increasingly hostile statements from Baghdad about
the United States betrayed ``a sense of irrational urgency there.''
   Saddam, he said, is ``trying to whip up support and make this
Iraq versus the United States. Indeed, it is Iraq versus the rest
of the world.''
   Bush said he had conferred at length by telephone Wednesday with
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He also spoke with Greek Prime
Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, continuing his daily round of
conversations with global leaders on the gulf crisis.
   The president, midway through a 25-day vacation in Maine that
has repeatedly been interrupted by crisis planning, urged Americans
to conserve energy, but said supplies for now are adequate. And he
disdained a suggestion that he might want to keep his
two-mile-per-gallon speedboat Fidelity docked.
   ``I'm going to keep using my boat. And I hope the rest of
America will prudently recreate. I don't think we've reached the
point where I want to call on everybody in the recreation industry
to shut it down, or everybody that's taking a vacation in America
to shut it down,'' Bush said.
   ``We are doing everything we can to guarantee that we don't
panic Americans and that there will be an adequate supply of
hydrocarbons. But I think it is a good time to conserve ... I would
call upon Americans to conserve.''
   Reporters asked Bush to prod the Saudis not to restrict the
American news media from covering Operation Desert Shield.
   Bush gave an equivocal reply, saying, ``We are the guests of
Saudi Arabia in their country. ... The more coverage the better as
far as we're concerned.''
   He also said, referring to reporters who manage to reach Iraq,
that they should ask tough questions and be ``totally objective''
in their coverage.
   Asked about the Saudi foreign minister's statement Tuesday that
Iraq was willing to put ``all the cards on the table'' and
negotiate, Bush said, ``If they're willing to put all their cards
on the table, that's good .... including complying with
international law, that would be good.''
   Bush, in his executive order, said the call-up of reserves was
``necessary ... for the effective conduct of operational missions
in and around the Arabian Peninsula.''
   The president sent letters to Congress, informing leaders there
of his action that empowers Cheney to designate the reservists to
perform missions he ``may determine necessary.''
   It was the first time the president has activated the reserves
since March 1970, when the reserves were called up during a postal
strike. The last time reservists were called up for military duty
was in January 1968, when the Vietcong's Tet offensive led
President Lyndon B. Johnson to call up more than 35,000.

<HEAD>Bush Calls for Conservation, But Expects No Oil Shortage</HEAD>

   President Bush on Wednesday called
on Americans to conserve energy, but said he has no intentions of
giving up vacation jaunts on his power boat.
   Bush said during a news conference at his vacation home that
there is no reason to expect an oil shortage, despite a reduction
in world oil supplies cause by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and a
subsequent international embargo on Iraqi trade.
   ``I'm going to keep using my boat, and I hope the rest of
America will prudently recreate,'' said Bush, who has taken
excursions on his boat fidelity during his vacation.
   ``I don't think we've reached the point where I want to call on
everybody in the recreation industry to shut it down or everybody
that's taking a vacation in America to shut it down,'' the
president said.
   Persian Gulf tensions have meant a 4.2 million-barrel daily
reduction in oil on the world market. But there had been a supply
glut, and other oil producing nations are expected to make up much
of the shortfall.
   Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the United States was importing
between 600,000 and 700,000 barrels per day from the two nations,
about 4 percent of total U.S. oil consumption. There are 42 gallons
of oil in a barrel.
   Bush declined to say what conservation measures he favors. Last
week Energy Secretary James D. Watkins proposed boosting U.S. oil
production, while asking drivers to trim their gasoline use by
keeping tires properly inflated and obeying speed limits.
   ``We're doing everything we can to guarantee that we don't panic
Americans and that there will be an adequate supply of
hydrocarbons,'' the president said.
   ``I think it is a good time to conserve, so I'm glad you
reminded me of that and I would call upon Americans to conserve,''
Bush said in response to a question. ``That doesn't mean that life
screeches to a halt.''

<HEAD>Bush, Cheney Back Freer Media Access in Saudia Arabia</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf-Bush, Bjt</HEAD>

   President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said Wednesday they would welcome freer media access to U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia, but it's up to the Saudis to allow it.
   ``We are the guests of Saudi Arabia in their country,'' Bush
said during a news conference at his vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine. ``And the more coverage the better, as far as
we're concerned.''
   Asked by a reporter if he meant ``we're at the total mercy of
Saudi Arabia, that there's nothing we can do,'' Bush said he wasn't
saying that and handed off the question to Cheney.
   Cheney said U.S. officials would try to secure freer access for
journalists, but acknowledged that, ultimately, the Saudis are in
charge.
   ``I do not have the final authority over what kind of access the
government of Saudi Arabia grants to our press,'' he said. ``We'll
work with the government of Saudi Arabia to provide as much access
as we can.
   ``In the final analysis,'' he said, ``they'll make the decision,
but obviously, we will be advocates for the concept that there
should be significant coverage of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia
available to the American people.''
   The questions to Bush and Cheney were prompted by reports that
the Saudis are beginning to restrict media coverage and may order
most foreign journalists out of the country, possibly by week's end.
   Bush, after saying he supported freer coverage, raised the
subject of the work of journalists who went to Iraq and talked to
officials there.
   ``When people travel to countries like Iraq and countries of
that nature, I hope the press ... coverage will be totally
objective,'' he said. ``I hope the same tough questions are asked
in every country as they are in this country, and I'm speaking of
Iraq, particularly.''
   Asked by a network reporter if he were criticizing coverage,
Bush replied; ``I'm not criticizing. Don't be so sensitive about
it.''
   Cheney, commenting on the prospects for freer access in Saudi
Arabia, said the Saudis may not see eye-to-eye with the U.S. media
on what constitutes ``free and unrestricted'' coverage.
   ``They're very private in their personal lives and I think we
have to respect their culture just as they respect ours,'' Cheney
said.
   ``By the same token, I think it is important that we have an
adequate flow of information to the American people about what our
young men and women are doing in Saudi Arabia and I'm hopeful that
we'll be able to arrange that,'' he said.
   Cheney said coverage had been ``pretty good'' so far under
difficult circumstances. ``There are a lot of stories being filed
out of Saudi Arabia,'' he said.
   However, 11 major news organizations expressed concern about
current and prospective restrictions in Saudi Arabia in a letter
Wednesday to Bush.
   The media said ``minimum access'' has been available through the
Defense Department pool and extremely limited unilateral
representation, with more severe limitations in the offing.
   ``We respectfully request that the administration do everything
in its power to gain full media access to Saudi Arabia and to the
American presence there,'' the groups said. ``Perhaps accreditation
through the American military would be the correct solution.''
   The letter was signed by officials in the Washington bureaus of
ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN; The Associated Press; Time and Newsweek
magazines; and the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, New York
Times and Los Angeles Times.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned Iraq on
Wednesday that it will pay a ``terrible and fearsome price'' if it
tries to drag Israel into the Persian Gulf conflict.
   Shamir said President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is trying to
involve Israel ``so he can present this war as an Arab-Israeli war,
and then the whole Arab world would have to back him.''
   He denied Iraqi claims that Israeli soldiers were taking part in
the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia and that disguised
Israeli pilots and warplanes took part in the American effort.
   ``Israel had no involvement whatsoever in this storm from the
beginning. . . . Nobody can blame Israel that it played some role
here,'' Shamir said on Israel Television in his first major
interview since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``Those elements who wish to drag us into this whirlpool and
maybe plan to attack Israel know perfectly well that if they try to
do it, they will pay a terrible and fearsome price. People of
Israel are not ready to play with their fate.''
   Shamir acknowledged anxiety existed among the Israeli public and
that the government was worried over this ``hour of emergency.''
But he refused to calm Israelis by divulging details about Iraqi
military capabilities.
   Saddam has said he will retaliate by attacking Israel with
chemical weapons in event of a U.S. military strike. Israeli
military experts conflict on whether Iraqi missiles can carry
chemical warheads.
   Israel has said it will retaliate if Iraq attacks and launch a
military strike if Iraqi troops enter Jordan, which is between Iraq
and Israel.
   Shamir assured Jordan's King Hussein that Israel will not attack
his country first and was only interested in the stability of
Hussein's throne.
   Banging his fist on the table, he then assured Israel the army
was ready for battle and ``will know how to defend Israel at the
hour of emergency.''
   Shamir's comments came after a senior government official said
war between the United States and Iraq seemed inevitable, and
military analysts estimated that Israel would probably be dragged
into such a conflict.
   ``The bottom line is that the United States and Iraq are on a
collision course,'' said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The Americans are continuing to amass troops, and you don't do
that unless you have the intention of using them. At the same time,
you don't see the Iraqis offering anything that can provide a
reasonable basis for negotiations.''
   Shamir declined comment when asked about this scenario, saying
his job was to consider Israeli response to any eventuality.
   But military analysts _ several of whom regularly get leaks from
senior army officials _ agreed with the assessment.
   ``Most Israeli observers believe that it's likely the situation
will escalate into fighting between the United States and Iraq,''
said Joseph Alpher, deputy head of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies.
   ``If and when fighting between the United States and Iraq breaks
out, then Iraq most likely will try to drag Israel into it in order
to rally Arab support.''
   The escalation in the gulf poses a dilemma for Israel.
   While Israel sees itself as America's chief ally in the region,
its role has been to keep a low profile so as not to break up the
alliance against Iraq U.S. officials have tried to build with other
Arab nations.
   Differences over how low Israel's profile should be were evident
in arguments among Cabinet ministers over whether the government
should distribute gas masks to the public to protect against a
possible Iraqi attack.
   Some officials called for immediate distribution. Defense
authorities maintain this could panic the public or sent a wrong
signal to Iraq. Government leaders met on Wednesday to consider the
question but delayed a decision by creating a special ministerial
committee.

   The United States bolstered its forces in the Persian Gulf on
Wednesday with a call-up of reserves, and Jordan closed its border
with Iraq because of the strain of thousands of evacuees fleeing
Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Baghdad, meanwhile, claimed that two aircraft flying in from
Saudi Arabia penetrated three miles into its airspace. An
unidentified military spokesman quoted by the official Iraqi news
agency did not identify the planes or say whether they turned back
voluntarily or were chased by Iraqi planes.
   It also was not clear if the spokesman was referring to a
penetration of Iraq's own southern border with Saudi Arabia or that
of Kuwait, which Baghdad now considers part of Iraq.
   On the diplomatic front, cracks appeared in what had been
unprecedented U.S.-Soviet unity in the face of Iraqi aggression.
Reports from the United Nations said Moscow was slowing efforts to
win U.N. approval of a resolution allowing warships to enforce
sanctions against Iraq.
   In Moscow, officials disclosed that Soviet military experts
continue to train Iraqi soldiers in the use of their Soviet-built
weapons, three weeks after Moscow cut arms supplies to protest the
invasion of Kuwait.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III telephoned Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to urge Moscow to cooperate more fully
in isolating Iraq, a State Department official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The State Department announced it would defy Saddam Hussein's
demand to close the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait by Friday but said it
would reduce the staff. Other nations, including Britain, have
announced plans to do the same.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the decision was
consistent with ``our obligations to the American private
community.''
   About 2,500 Americans have been trapped in Kuwait and an
estimated 500 in Iraq since Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
There are about 120 U.S. diplomats in Kuwait.
   Iraqi took over its neighbor and drove out the ruling family
after accusing Kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes
land both sides claim. Iraq also blamed Kuwait for a loss in vital
oil revenue, saying it drove down world oil prices by cheating on
its oil production quota.
   Jordan's announcement that it was closing its border came
shortly after King Hussein told a news conference a total of 42,000
foreigners had crossed into Jordan during the day, the largest
number since the crisis erupted.
   Interior Minister Salem Msadeh said the border was being closed
because of ``concern for the health situation of the arrivals and
to ensure suitable arrangements for their stay in Jordan.''
   Hussein also said he would embark on a new round of talks with
Arab leaders in hopes of defusing the crisis. He declined to say
where he would go or with whom he would meet.
   Speaking in his palace to a room crowded with journalists,
Hussein said he believed ``We are almost facing a crisis of the
world gone mad.''
   Many Egyptians, Palestinians and other mostly Arab refugees
fleeing Kuwait have entered Jordan. Only a few Westerners have been
able to flee to safety. Iraq is holding the rest in a bid to force
the withdrawal of the U.S.-led multinational force defending Saudi
Arabia from Iraqi aggression.
   President Bush ordered the Pentagon to call up reserves for
active duty in the gulf. He did not say how many units were called
up, but sources said as many as 40,000 may join Operation Desert
Shield by the end of the month.
   It was the first activation of military reserves in 20 years.
   At the same time, the United States intensified the military
buildup in the Persian Gulf. The aircraft carrier Saratoga steamed
through Egypt's Suez Canal toward the Red Sea to join a growing
American flotilla, a canal spokesman said.
   U.S. and other warships have been shadowing Iraqi vessels in the
gulf to enforce the U.N. embargo. One of those vessels, an Iraqi
tanker that defied warning shots from an American warship, reached
Yemen's port of Aden Wednesday and dropped anchor near two other
Iraqi ships in the harbor. Yemen had told the U.N. Security Council
it would turn away the tanker and adhere to U.N. sanctions.
   The five permanent members of the Security Council met Wednesday
to discuss a possible military blockade to enforce the sanctions.
But Moscow was holding back, Western diplomats said, saying the
Soviets want proof of the embargo's failure before approving
military force.
   China had dragged its feet for the same reason, but a Kuwaiti
official in Beijing said Wednesday the Chinese government promised
not to block such a resolution.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering said the five permanent council
members _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, China and
France _ were ``making progress'' drafting a resolution.

   President Bush on Wednesday opened
the way for a U.S. company to help build a space port in Australia
for a commercial firm that eventually hopes to launch American-made
satellites with Soviet rockets.
   Bush authorized the State Department to grant a license to USBI
Co. of Huntsville, Ala., a subsidiary of United Technologies, for
the company to participate in the project at Cape York, Australia.
The launch site would be operated in conjunction with the Cape York
Space Agency.
   Bush's approval was needed because of security restrictions on
sharing of technology with foreign countries. It allows planning
for the project to proceed, but does not give a final sign off.
   Whether American-made satellites will ever be launched from Cape
York is only a hypothetical question at this time, said a source on
the president's National Space Council who asked not to be named.
   ``No U.S. satellite manufacturer, vendor or user has said he
wants to launch on a Soviet rocket,'' the source said. ``USBI has
been invited by the Aussies to help design and run the facility.
They need their expertise; that's what the license is all about.''
   USBI would provide program management, engineering and
development for the launching facility and the Soviet Union would
provide the boosters. The United States government has no
involvement except to approve the license, said White House
spokesman Steve Hart.
   The final license for the project could only be granted upon
completion of agreements among the Soviets, Australia and USBI, he
said. The agreements must provide that the Soviets provide boosters
only for the single launch site and that U.S. regulations on
technology transfers to the Soviet Union will be observed, the
White House said.
   Those agreements are expected to be worked out in the near
future.
   Hart said the government's intent is to ensure fair competition
in international commercial space ventures.
   USBI executive Vice President Al Reeser said in a statement that
the licensing ``will enable us to be a major participant in
international launch services.''
   ``We are pleased USBI is able to support the Cape York space
agency. It is a big step for us.''
   The Cape York Space Agency is a private international consortium
that hopes to provide launch services needed to support commercial
space ventures.
   The consortium was started by more than 60 firms from several
nations.

   Saddam's vow to place foreigners at military installations for
use as human shields against attack drew more angry protests
Wednesday. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the Iraqi
president a ``destructive loser'' whose tactics reflect his
isolation. Denmark suggested Saddam may be seeking to divide the
allies by freeing some foreigners but holding others.
   The State Department says 54 Americans are believed to have been
seized by Iraqi authorities, and Britain says 21 of its citizens
are being held at Iraqi installations.
   Iraq said Wednesday it would allow some French and Japanese
nationals to leave as a ``goodwill gesture.'' About 731 Japanese
and 560 French citizens are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Before the announcement, an Iraqi state newspaper warned Europe
and Japan of danger ``if they walk in the steps of Washington.''
Another said Iraq would take war ``into the cities of attacking
nations.''
   Pope John Paul II made his first public comment on the crisis
Wednesday, pointing to ``the danger of war'' and offering a prayer
for peace.
   Also Wednesday, France said it was sending its first forces, a
reconnaissance squadron of 180 soldiers, to the Persian Gulf. And
Turkey, Iraq's neighbor, said it was considering joining the
multinational force.
   On Tuesday, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy said they
were sending warships to the gulf, and the nine-member Western
European Union, meeting in Paris, agreed to to coordinate military
action.
   At a news conference in Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush said he was
not familiar with the report that Soviet military advisers remained
in Iraq and said he had no argument with the Soviet response to the
Persian Gulf crisis. ``At this point, I would say we are getting
superb cooperation from the Soviets,'' Bush said.
   Col. Valentin Ogurtsov told a news conference in Moscow that 193
unarmed military experts are finishing their ``contractual
obligations'' to show Iraqis how to use state-of-the art tanks, jet
fighters and missiles, and to maintain and repair the hardware.
   Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan arrived in the Soviet Union
Wednesday for talks, the official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   In other diplomatic activity, two top U.N. officials held talks
in Baghdad with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on the fate of
the trapped foreigners.
   Also, defense ministers from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council met in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a unified defense
strategy to complement the U.S.-led military buildup in Saudi
Arabia.
   Tensions in the Middle East pushed up wholesale energy prices
Wednesday beyond the $30-a-barrel level for crude oil and depressed
prices of stocks, bonds and the dollar.
   Also Wednesday, a 19-year-old sailor was killed in an electrical
accident aboard the USS Antietam, a Navy spokesman said. Petty
Officer Third Class Daniel M. Jones, an electrician's mate, was the
second serviceman to die as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis.
Air Force Staff Sgt. John Campisi, 30, died Aug. 12 when he was hit
by a military truck.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross is
treading gingerly in the gulf crisis, fearing to anger Iraq by
concentrating on the fate of Western hostages.
   Highlighting its precarious position was Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's accusation that the ICRC had failed to act to protect
the thousands of trapped foreigners.
   There was no direct comment from the all-Swiss agency,
traditionally pledged to confidentiality in its role as impartial
monitor of the Geneva Conventions.
   A spokesman merely noted that the ICRC has been in touch with
all states concerned since early August to ensure protection of the
civilian population in both Iraq and Kuwait.
   The head of the agency's Middle East section flew to Baghdad
Monday with a personal message from ICRC President Cornelio
Sommaruga dealing with all issues of ``humanitarian concern.''
   Sources familiar with committee thinking said its first aim is
to continue practical work to help all people requiring assistance.
Focusing on the trapped Westerners would raise doubts about its
neutral stand, the sources added.
   The ICRC has been seeking authority to visit Kuwait to find out
about the medical, food and other needs of the population. It has
also been seeking to gain access to foreign nationals, but without
success.
   The text of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the protection of
civilians suggests that Iraq is clearly in violation of its
provisions. Iraq joined the convention in 1956.
   But so far, the ICRC has stopped short of saying so publicly.
   By the announced transfer of foreigners to strategic locations,
Baghdad violated article 28 stipulating that ``the presence of a
protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas
immune from military operations.''
   A 1977 additional protocol elaborates on that, but neither Iraq
nor the United States has ratified it.
   The text says the presence or movement of civilians ``shall not
be used ... in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks
or to shield, favor, or impede military operations.''
   The 1949 convention says ``the taking of hostages is
prohibited'' and that all aliens must be free to leave the
territory of a party to a conflict ``unless their departure is
contrary to the national interests of the State.''
   Internees must not be held in ``areas particularly exposed to
the dangers of war'' and they have the right to be visited by ICRC
delegates. A special section dealing with occupied territories
includes a prohibition of ``individual or mass transfers'' of
persons from there to the territory of the occupying power.
   Kuwait is an occupied territory according to a U.N. Security
Council resolution, but so far Iraq has not allowed ICRC delegates
to visit there.
   The section on occupied territories has been cited by the ICRC
on repeated occasions in denouncing Israel's policies in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But the organization's position in Israel is relatively strong
because the Jewish state cannot afford the bad publicity of barring
the 42 ICRC delegates working there.
   In contrast, any public stand by the ICRC against Iraq might
spell an end to its humanitarian mission in the Gulf crisis.
Sources familiar with ICRC concepts said the agency has to be
pragmatic and, that it must not risk blocking its work for a
question of principle. Its Baghdad delegation includes 37 members.
   The sources, who declined to be identified further, said the
ICRC had to maintain credible neutrality in this confrontation and
to stress that it is not an instrument of Western or any other
governments.
   The Geneva Conventions say it is up to signatory governments to
make sure they are respected.
   The decision by neutral Switzerland, a non-U.N. member, to join
the U.N. sanctions against Iraq has increased difficulties for the
ICRC. The agency is known to have had serious misgivings when the
Bern government proposed joining the world body, a proposal that
was overwhelmingly defeated in a 1986 referendum.

<HEAD>Military Man Named Interim Head of Panama's Civilian Police Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Guillermo Endara announced
Wednesday that a military officer has been named the interim chief
of the country's newly created national police force.
   Endara told a news conference that he had appointed Lt. Col.
Fernando Quezada to the post of director of the National Police
after four civilians turned down the job offer for ``personal or
professional reasons.''
   Quezada will replace on an interim basis Col. Eduardo Herrera,
who retired after holding the position since December's U.S.
invasion that ousted Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   Endara refused to say whether the permanent head of the National
Police will be a civilian.
   Panama created the National Police after the invasion as a
civilian-run security force. It replaced the Panamanian Defense
Forces, which for more than two decades filled both military and
police functions.
   U.S. police and Army Reservists have trained the new force, but
many of its 13,000 members served in the Defense Forces, which was
led by Noriega.
   Quezada was among a group of Defense Forces officers who
unsuccessfully tried to overthrow Noriega in March 1988. He was
imprisoned until the December invasion.
   Endara said he had instructed Quezada to ``deploy all available
national police to protect, prevent and put down any criminal
activity.''
   Panama has suffered a recent rash of robberies at banks,
airports and businesses.

<HEAD>NBC Accuses Iraq of Blocking Its Entry, But CNN to Enter Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC, the only one of the three major U.S.
networks not yet allowed into Iraq since the Persian Gulf crisis,
accused Iraq on Wednesday of denying it entry because of seven
highly critical NBC reports since 1988.
   It said it was being ``censored'' by that nation because of NBC
reports that include ones on Iraq's use of poison gas on its
Kurdish minority, Iraq's efforts to obtain triggers for nuclear
weapons, and the country's biological weapons development program.
   NBC's rivals also have reported on those stories.
   NBC's unusual statement came as Cable News Network said that
Iraq had granted it entry visas for Washington columnist Rowland
Evans, who does two CNN weekend shows, and a CNN crew. The visas
are good for Thursday and Friday.
   ``We expect to have them in there tomorrow,'' said CNN spokesman
John Bianchi.
   Despite repeated and ``aggressive'' efforts by NBC to get
similar visas, ``NBC News has still been denied access'' to Iraq,
NBC News' executive vice president, Don Browne, said in a statement.
   ``We can only conclude that we are being censored by the Iraq
government _ singled out because of a series of exclusive reports
on `NBC Nightly News,' '' he said, referring to a list of seven NBC
reports on the program.
   CBS and ABC crews, led by anchorman Dan Rather and Ted Koppel,
respectively, were allowed into Baghdad last week, with Koppel the
first U.S. network journalist permitted in since Iraq's Aug. 2
takeover of Kuwait.
   Iraq officials have since ordered all of them out. The last
network contingent to leave was from CBS. It left Baghdad on
Tuesday.
   CNN's Evans, who writes the syndicated ``Evans and Novak''
column with Robert Novak, is being sent to Baghdad instead of a
regular CNN correspondent because of his long expertise in Middle
East affairs, said Bianchi.
   It isn't yet known if Evans will be able to arrange an interview
with Iraq leader Saddam Hussein, Bianchi said. ``We don't know what
they'll get or what they'll be allowed to get.''

   Two weeks after the FBI settled a racial
harassment case brought by black agent Donald Rochon, the agency
named its top-ranking black field agent to investigate allegations
brought by Rochon, the FBI said Wednesday.
   As part of the settlement of the Rochon case, the agency agreed
to conduct a full investigation of Rochon's claims and make the
findings public by next April, said Rochon's attorney, David Kairys
of Philadelphia.
   ``We are confirming that Paul Philip will be heading an
investigation looking into the allegations made by Mr. Rochon,''
FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez said Wednesday.
   Philip, 43, currently heads the field office in San Juan, Puerto
Rico. He is the only black agent in charge of a bureau field office.
   The appointment by FBI Director William S. Sessions was made
``very, very recently,'' Fernandez said, but it had not been
announced because, ``We have investigations all the time being
headed by special agents. We don't make announcements about that.''
   The New York Times reported Wednesday on the appointment.
   Rochon had charged in civil lawsuits that he was racially
harassed by white agents when he worked in the FBI's Chicago
office. Among other things, he claimed his family received
threatening telephone calls and letters, including one that
contained a photograph of the dismembered body of a black man.
Another contained a bull's eye superimposed with a picture of a
black man.
   Attorneys for the 40-year-old Rochon and the FBI signed an
agreement the week of Aug. 5 that settled the 3-year-old legal
battle. The settlement brought Rochon full pay and pension
benefits, possibly worth a total of more than $1 million, Kairys
said.
   Several members of Congress accused Sessions in April of
tolerating discrimination, allegations denied by Sessions.
   A federal judge ruled in September 1988 that the FBI had engaged
in widespread discrimination against its Hispanic employees.
Officials acknowledged earlier this year that the FBI had settled
three other racial discrimination suits, including one involving 30
employees of the fingerprint identification section.
   Philip has a ``tough assignment,'' said one congressional
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the source added:
``We think it's significant that he reports directly to the
director and he has a team of eight agents working for him. He
certainly has the manpower to do the job.''
   Fernandez said it was not clear where Philip will be based as he
conducts the investigation.
   ``He's not going to be in any one particular place,'' Fernandez
said. ``He'll go wherever the investigation takes him.''
   Rochon has been on disability leave since April because of
emotional stress, and the settlement keeps him on disability leave
until he is eligible to retire in 11 years, Kairys said. In
addition, the FBI agreed to award Rochon some back pay for a
promotion the agent claimed he was unfairly denied, and will pay
Rochon's former wife, Susan, an undisclosed sum of money as
compensation.

<TEXT>
   A contract clause citing war as a valid
excuse for canceling hotel reservations helped save a National
Guard group about $10,000 Wednesday.
   Because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, there are about 600
fewer National Guard members than expected at the 19th Annual
Conference of The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the
United States, said Master Sgt. Tony Nathe. He is president of the
private lobbying group, which has about 60,000 National Guard
members.
   The conference opened Tuesday at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, where
the group had expected about 1,500 members to attend meetings over
four days, Nathe said.
   Attendance suffered because a large percentage of the group
normally flies to the event in National Guard transport planes as
part of training for National Guard pilots, he said. Most of those
planes were unavailable because of the conflict, Nathe said.
   Because the group filled less than 80 percent of its reserved
block of rooms at the Hyatt, it faced a charge of about $10,000 for
use of meeting rooms that otherwise would have been free, he said.
   ``They (hotel managers) were saying, `Come on, you're not going
to meet your block,' '' Nathe said. ``I told them to look at the
war clause.''
   A clause in the hotel contract said the agreement was subject to
``acts of God, war, government regulations, disaster, strikes,
civil disorder, curtailment of transportation facilities or other
emergency.''
   ``Actually, there's been no war declared, but officially there's
been no declaration of war since World War II and you know we've
been in combat since then,'' said Sgt. Robert Metcalf, a conference
organizer.
   ``It was pretty hard to hold them to the contract because of
that clause,'' said Bill Gannage, the hotel's executive assistant
manager of food and beverage. ``It's necessary to be as flexible as
possible based on the circumstances in the Middle East.''
   The group had made 400 room reservations at the Hyatt and needed
to occupy 320 of the rooms to have free use of the meeting rooms,
said Mike Pileggi, a conference organizer. The group only filled
193 of the rooms, Pileggi said.
   Softening the blow, the Guard group agreed to have a banquet at
the Hyatt on Friday. The banquet had been scheduled for another
site in Minneapolis, but was switched because fewer people than
expected had signed up, Metcalf said.

   Polly needa lawyer. Police here
placed a parrot in custody Wednesday after the bird attacked a
housewife and then repeatedly bit the arresting officer while
attempting a breakout.
   Constable Mark Levitt of the Wiltshire Constabulary nabbed the
green parrot at the home of Carolyne Samuel in Hullavington. The
housewife had called police after the bird flew into her home and
attacked her.
   ``The parrot was very aggressive so, using police issue
protective gloves, I picked it up and put it in a cardboard box and
carried it to my police car,'' said Levitt, a crime intelligence
officer at divisional headquarters in Chippenham, 90 miles west of
London.
   The bird then made its bid for freedom by biting a hole in the
side of the box, Levitt said.
   ``Moments later it was free and was flying around the police
car,'' Levitt said. ``He was extremely annoyed and bit me eight
times on the arm, drawing blood. I managed to grab him again and
shoved him in the dashboard glove box where he couldn't create any
more havoc.''
   Levitt detained the bird in a cage at his home and then went to
Chippenham District Hospital for treatment.
   On Wednesday night, the policeman said the parrot was safely
under lock and key.
   ``I've got my revenge,'' Levitt said. ``I keep parrots of my own
and the bird is now being kept in line by my African Grey, who is a
bit of a yob (hooligan).''
   Police said they were attempting to trace the parrot's owner.

   A company that makes a five-minute AIDS test said
Wednesday it has recalled a batch of 11,000 because of weak
readings for the presence of antibodies against the deadly virus.
   ``Our quality control department found that the performance in
this particular lot no longer meets our quality control release
standards,'' said Christina Pappas, a spokeswoman for
Worcester-based Cambridge BioScience.
   Pappas said the 11,000 tests _ packed in 140 kits _ represent
only a fraction of the company's sales for the test. The tests are
designed for use by physicians in clinics.
   The BioScience test is the only five-minute AIDS test that has
received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, according
to an FDA spokesman. Other tests must be sent out to testing
laboratories for results.
   Pappas said that as far as the company knows, there have been no
reports of false test results, either positive or negative.
   The company has notified all its customers and is replacing kits
that are in the defective group.

   The cost of cleaning up the Exxon Valdez oil
spill off the coast of Alaska helped give the state the fastest
growing per capita income in the nation last year, the government
said Wednesday.
   Alaskans' per capita 1989 income totaled $21,656 for each man,
woman and child, up 12.6 percent from the year earlier, according
to revised estimates by the Commerce Department's Bureau of
Economic Analysis.
   That was nearly double the national average growth rate of 6.6
percent. The average per capita income was $17,596.
   Per capita income is the annual total personal income of
residents, divided by the state's population. Personal income is
income received from all sources, less personal contributions for
social insurance.
   Three other Western states _ Hawaii, Nevada and Washington _ and
farm states North Dakota, Montana, South Dakota, Idaho and Iowa
were among the 10 states with the fastest growing per capita
incomes.
   Maine, which had strong growth in both farm and non-farm income,
was the only state east of the Mississippi River to make the top 10.
   ``The four Western states ... had fast non-farm income growth,
mainly in manufacturing, construction and private service-type
industries,'' the report said.
   ``The five farm states ... had fast growth in farm income,
mainly reflecting a rebound from the 1988 drought,'' it said.
   Much of Alaska's earnings came from the lumber, food processing
and oil and gas industries, the report said.
   But it added: ``A strong gain in transportation earnings
reflected expenditures for clean-up operations associated with the
oil spill in March 1989. Hotel services and retail trade also
showed strength in Alaska; these industries supplied shelter and
food for workers involved in the clean up.''
   Hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline were fouled when the
tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into a charted reef March 24, 1989,
releasing nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into
the water.
   It was the nation's biggest oil spill, coating hundreds of miles
of shoreline and killing hundreds of otters and thousands of birds
and other animals.
   Last summer's $2 billion clean-up program involved more than
10,000 workers and 1,000 boats.
   North Dakota had the second fastest per capita growth rate, up
9.9 percent. It was followed by Hawaii, 9.7 percent; Montana, 9.4
percent; South Dakota, 8.6 percent; Idaho, 8.3 percent; Iowa, 8.2
percent; Maine and Nevada, 8 percent each; and Washington state,
7.8 percent.
   States with the slowest growth were New Hampshire, 4.4 percent;
Georgia, 5.1 percent; Kansas, 5.2 percent; and Arizona and
California, 5.4 percent each.
   Connecticut had the highest per capita income, $24,683, followed
by New Jersey, $23,778; Massachusetts, $22,174; Alaska, $21,656;
New York, $21,073; Maryland, $21,013; New Hampshire, $20,267;
California, $19,929, Nevada, $19,269; and Virginia, $18,927.
   The District of Columbia was not ranked as a state, but posted a
per capita income of $23,491.
   At the bottom of the list were: Mississippi, $11,724; West
Virginia, $12,345; Arkansas, $12,901; Louisiana, $12,921; Utah,
$13,079; New Mexico, $13,140; North Dakota, $13,563; Alabama,
$13,625; South Carolina, $13,634; and South Dakota, $13,685.

   Convicted killer Mark Hofmann, the forger
of Mormon historical documents who used bombs to cover his tracks,
was in critical but stable condition Wednesday following a drug
overdose, officials said.
   Hofmann, 35, serving a life sentence, was found unconscious at
Utah State Prison shortly after noon and was taken to the
University of Utah Health Sciences Center, said hospital
spokeswoman Anne Brillinger.
   Brillinger confirmed that, for the second time in less than two
years, Hofmann was being treated for an overdose of antidepressant
drugs. She said he was conscious but still listed as critical.
   Hofmann pleaded guilty in January 1987 to second-degree murder
in the Oct. 15, 1985, pipe-bomb slayings of Steven F. Christensen,
30, and Kathleen Webb Sheets, 50. He also pleaded guilty to theft
by deception in his fraudulent document dealings, which netted him
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   Hofmann has said he killed Christensen to prevent him exposing
his trafficking in fraudulent Mormon historical documents, and left
the second bomb outside the Sheets home as a diversion.
   Hofmann became the chief suspect in the two bombings a day after
the explosions when a third pipe bomb blew him from his parked car
in downtown Salt Lake City. Hofmann claimed he meant to kill
himself, but police scoffed at that notion, saying he was seeking
another victim.
   Hofmann was hospitalized after a guard was unable to awaken him
for his noon meal, said Dave Franchina, a state Department of
Corrections spokesman. Hofmann was being housed in a
maximum-security unit with a convicted killer who was taking a
routine cold medication, Franchina said. Hofmann wasn't taking any
prescription medication, he said.
   Hofmann didn't have access to the infirmary, but could mingle
with other inmates for four hours a day, Franchina said.
   Investigators found nothing during an initial search of the cell.
   On Sept. 15, 1988, Hofmann was rushed from the prison to the
same hospital in critical condition after taking an overdose of
antidepressants in quantities sufficient, barring medical aid, to
have caused his death.

<HEAD>British Files New Charge in Iraqi `Super Gun' Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHEFFIELD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An additional charge of arms dealing
was lodged on Wednesday against a scientist accused of involvement
in the Iraqi ``super gun'' project.
   Metallurgist Christopher Cowley, 51, was accused of dealing with
components and forgings for large caliber armaments and projectors
between April 1, 1988, and June 30, 1989, when such equipment was
banned from export.
   Cowley was formerly associated with Space Research Corp. of
Brussels, Belgium, founded by Gerald Bull, a Canadian-born U.S.
citizen.
   Bull, credited with being the world's leading designer of
long-range guns, was was mysteriously murdered outside an apartment
in a Brussels suburb on March 22 and his heirs said later the
company had been dissolved.
   Bull worked on advanced howitzer systems for the U.S. Army, and
his technology was used by Israel, South Africa and both sides in
the Iran-Iraq conflict.
   Bull was said to be working for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on a satellite to be launched from a rocket-propelled shell fired
from a huge cannon at the time of his death.
   Cowley, who was charged previously in other dealings, was
released on bond of $48,000 until Oct. 10 by magistrates in
Sheffield, northern England.
   British customs officers in April seized large tubes that they
said could be used to construct a giant gun barrel. Trucks heading
for Iraq with steel forgings made in Britain were stopped in Turkey
and Greece. Iraq said the pipes were part of an oil pipeline
project.
   The Sheffield magistrates also allowed another defendant in the
case, business executive Peter V. Mitchell, 42, to remain free
until Nov. 15, on bond of $48,000. He is accused of exporting
prohibited goods.
   Both men first appeared in court on May 3.
   Meanwhile in Geneva, Britain on Wednesday voiced ``deep
concern'' about activities of some states that have ratified the
treaty to halt the spread of atomic weapons. It cited the recent
seizure of an Iraq-bound shipment of what it suspected to be
nuclear triggers.
   Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave addressed a
140-nation conference reviewing implementation of the 1970 treaty.
   He did not specifically name any countries in referring to ``the
question of clandestine procurement'' of nuclear technology. But he
recalled the ``publicity surrounding recent action'' by British
authorities ``to prevent export of sensitive items.''
   It was an evident reference to the seizure at Heathrow airport
of a shipment of what investigators said were nuclear triggers
bound for Iraq.

   Moss Hart's 1948 Broadway comedy, ``Light Up the
Sky,'' set on opening night of a play's out-of-town tryouts, is
being given a full-throttle revival at off-Broadway's Roundabout
Theater. It opened Tuesday night.
   The stage, the star actress' livingroom in a Boston hotel suite,
is full of flowers and actors playing a lot of very dramatic
theatrical people.
   The laugh lines and pace aren't a mile a minute, and if Hart was
satirizing people he knew, we don't know them now. But this is a
comedy of delicious characters and situations. And the actors on
the Roundabout stage don't stint on showing full measures of humor
and ridiculousness.
   Charles Keating is perfection as Carleton Fitzgerald, a
``sensitive'' director whose head-thrown-back poses and
preciousness are summed up in his frequent exclamations, ``I could
cry.''
   Peggy Cass never overplays the star's mother, who specializes in
zingers. Linda Carlson does overplay, on purpose, conveying a
temperamental star who's not a great actress. Bruce Weitz and Betsy
Joslyn have ``Guys and Dolls'' accents and bright, applaudable
moves as the play's producer and his wife.
   Bill McCutcheon, as always, makes his part a gem. Near the end,
he comes in blinking, as a bewildered, rich, elderly, lovable
theater buff.
   The three acts are divided by time: toasting success before the
play, vituperation after the play was laughed at, rejoicing when
the play gets rave reviews. John Bolger plays the naive playwright,
a rather colorless character but the only one who changes. He's
delighted, then disillusioned. Whether he'll pull himself together
in Act 3, enough to do some rewrites _ of course he will _ is the
only suspense.
   ``Light Up the Sky'' isn't about suspense. It's about the funny
side of the mercurial characters and the pothole-filled road to
getting a show on Broadway.
   Larry Carpenter directed. Andrew Jackness designed the set and
Martin Pakledinaz the costumes. The play will run at the Roundabout
through Sept. 16. It will be followed by Hal Holbrook in ``King
Lear'' from Oct. 17 to Dec. 2.

   Richard W. Miller turned to espionage out of
frustration with his life and career and his infatuation with a
Soviet spy, a prosecutor alleged Wednesday as the former FBI
agent's third trial began.
   ``His brand of espionage was a crime of dollars and cents. It
was a crime of lust. It was a crime of dissatisfaction. For him, it
was even a crime of boredom,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Schiff
said in opening statement.
   Most of all, the prosecutor added, it was crime of ``pure
selfishness and self-interest.''
   Miller's defense attorney, Joel Levine, denied the agent had
traded secrets for sex and money, and contended he actually started
his relationship with a Soviet spy to infiltrate the KGB so he
could score points with the FBI.
   Miller was ``trying to resurrect his career and, to coin a
phrase, snatch victory from the jaws of defeat,'' Levine said in
his opening statement.
   Miller, wearing a tan suit over his large frame, took notes
during opening statements. Two of Miller's sons sat among the
spectators behind him in the courtroom.
   The court session Wednesday marked the beginning of the third
trial for Miller, the first FBI agent ever accused and convicted of
espionage.
   His first trial ended in a hung jury and the second resulted in
a conviction later overturned by an appeals court because of trial
errors.
   The latest trial is being held without a jury before U.S.
District Court Judge Robert Takasugi, who took over for Judge David
Kenyon. After presiding over the first two trials, Kenyon
disqualified himself from further action.
   The defense had requested Takasugi decide the case to avoid
another hung jury that could prompt yet another trial.
   Miller, arrested in 1984, was imprisoned for five years before
being granted bail in October 1989 by the appellate court. He was
released from prison in November 1989 after posting $337,000 bail.
   As in the previous trials, attorneys on both sides portrayed
Miller as an overweight bumbler of an FBI agent, so absent-minded
he once left his keys in front door of an FBI field office when he
left for the night.
   Once again, the prosecution sought to link Miller's problems at
work to his relationship with Soviet spy Svetlana Ogorodnikov, whom
he met in 1984.
   Schiff said that in 1984 Miller's career was down in the dumps:
he was spending 40 hours a week listening to wiretaps and had been
given a two-week suspension for failing to meet an FBI weight
standard.
   Miller's marriage was crumbling, and his financial problems were
so bad he was taking out cash advances on his credit card and
holding an outside job selling advertising for shopping carts to
make ends meet.
   ``Richard W. Miller was ready for a private rebellion,'' said
Schiff. ``The evidence will show that Richard W. Miller did not
start his FBI career intending to be a spy, but a spy he became.''
   For Miller, Ms. Ogorodinkov offered a solution to all his
problems, the prosecutor said.
   The two began a sexual relationship, and Miller accepted $65,000
in cash and gold for giving her an FBI document outlining U.S.
intelligence goals, Schiff said.
   ``Miller was infatuated with Svetlana Ogorodnikova. He enjoyed
spending time with her, enjoyed sex with her,'' said Schiff.
``...He then saw her as a terrific opportunity to make a quick buck
and a very big buck.''
   The prosecutor said that when Miller discovered the FBI was on
his trail, he admitted several times to passing the document to
her, and at one point even referred to ``documents in the plural.''
   The validity of the admissions are central to Miller's defense.
Takasugi denied a defense pretrial request to exclude the
statements from the trial.
   His attorneys contend Miller tried to tell the truth, but that
FBI agents, with the preconceived notion he was lying, grilled him
until he told them what they wanted to hear.
   The defense also pointed to religious admonitions Miller got
from his boss, Richard Bretzing, a bishop in the Mormon church.
Those admonitions, and other conversations, pressured Miller into
an admission, Levine said.
   ``Mr. Miller became very emotional from (those) admonitions,
and, in fact, cried on both occasions,'' said Levine.
   Levine noted the FBI had tried in 1982 to use Ms. Ogordnidov to
get into the KGB with no success, and details of the investigation
were in a file Miller had reviewed.
   The defense attorney acknowledged Miller was ``a bad agent in
many respects,'' but Levine contended it was Miller's shortcomings
that prompted him to try to infiltrate the KGB without
authorization.

   The Bush administration decided Wednesday to
reduce the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait but defied Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein by refusing to shut down.
   Saddam has set Friday as the deadline for the U.S. and other
foreign embassies to close and shift operations to Baghdad, the
Iraqi capital.
   Asked what would happen next, President Bush said: ``We'll wait
and see.''
   There are about 60 American diplomats and about 60 dependents in
Kuwait City. The State Department ordered all the dependents,
including nearly 30 children, to leave.
   A number of U.S. diplomats also were ordered to leave. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said those officials no longer
were needed because their jobs involved dealing with the overthrown
Kuwaiti government. He declined to say how many were involved.
   About 2,500 Americans are trapped in the Persian Gulf country.
Some may have been rounded up with other Westerners and sent to oil
refineries and other industrial sites as a deterrent to U.S.
military attack.
   On Monday, Bush described the Americans in Kuwait and about 530
in Iraq as hostages. He has insisted _ unsuccessfully so far _ that
they be permitted to leave.
   Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador to Washington, was
summoned to the State Department on Wednesday to receive a special
appeal for the release of 12 Americans with what Boucher described
as ``urgent medical problems.''
   He gave a non-committal reply and was expected to convey the
request to Baghdad, a U.S. official said afterward.
   Boucher said the U.S. intention to keep the embassy open was
consistent with U.N. Security Council resolutions and ``with our
obligations to the American private community.''
   The reduction in embassy staff was announced in a separate
message for broadcast to Americans in Kuwait by the Voice of
America and the British Broadcasting Co.
   ``The Iraqi government has from the beginning of this situation
stated that diplomats are free to leave Kuwait,'' the message said.
``We are taking them at their word and have ordered the departure
of all dependents and staff that do not have a mission in Kuwait at
this time.''
   The first group of U.S. diplomats and dependents designated to
leave Kuwait will depart in the next day or so, Boucher said.
   Another eight Americans who worked for United Nations agencies
in Kuwait and their families may have reached Jordan Tuesday night,
he said.
   Britain, the Soviet Union and several other nations already had
decided to reduce their diplomatic staffs in Kuwait but to keep
their embassies open despite Saddam's order.
   ``American citizens should be assured that we plan to have
sufficient diplomatic staff at the embassy in Kuwait to look after
their safety and welfare, which remains our highest priority,''
Boucher said.
   The announcement made no reference to a staff reduction. It
stressed that Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and other American
diplomats in Kuwait ``will serve our community to the best of their
ability.''
   ``We are determined to continue working for your release from
Kuwait and your safe return to your families,'' it said.
   The broadcast advised Americans thinking of leaving Kuwait to
``plan their route carefully.'' It said Iraqi forces were under
orders to stop and detain anyone identified as a U.S. citizen. A
British citizen trying to leave the country was shot and killed,
the broadcast said.
   Until now, the State Department and the embassy had advised
Americans not to try to leave Kuwait without permission. About 500
Americans ignored the advice and got out.
   Asked why the message had been changed, Boucher said: ``The
situation for Americans has changed. ... We try to provide our best
advice.''
   One problem confronting administration decision-makers is
whether the American diplomats will be able to leave easily or
safely. Boucher said Iraq had given assurances they would not need
exit permits.
   Last week, when Iraq demanded that Americans and Britons in
Kuwait gather at hotels, the embassy conveyed the order but gave no
specific advice. A handful of Americans went to the hotel, found no
Iraqi authorities there and left the next day.
   Saddam on Monday warned diplomats in Kuwait to close their
embassies by Friday and transfer their missions to Baghdad.
Otherwise, a foreign ministry spokesman said, they ``will be
treated ... as ordinary foreign nationals.''
   Nine Western European nations, meeting Tuesday in Paris,
rejected the ultimatum.

<HEAD>Coup Attempt Thwarted in Comoro Islands, Government Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces in the Comoro Islands have thwarted
a coup attempt by European mercenaries against the new government
of the Indian Ocean republic, the Comoran Foreign Ministry
announced.
   In a communique received Tuesday by Paris-based news
organizations, the ministry said the attempt to topple President
Said Mohamed Djohar took place Saturday night.
   No details were provided.
   Voters in the Comoros chose Djohar on March 11 to succeed Ahmed
Abdallah Abderrahmane, widely believed to have been assassinated by
the French mercenary Bob Denard.
   The Comoran Foreign Ministry said security forces thwarted the
coup by arresting an unnamed European and two native supporters of
Mohamed Taki, Djohar's main opponent in last spring's disputed
elections.
   They carried documents outlining a commando strike against a
military camp, the official Radio Comoro broadcasting station and
the French Embassy in the capital of Moroni, the ministry said.
   ``The operation was intended to destabilize President Said
Mohamed Djohar and the young Comoran democracy,'' the statement
said.
   It added that Djohar appealed on the radio for ``all Comorans to
mobilize and stand up to the mercenaries.''
   The plotters hoped to drive out French paratroopers who arrived
last December to guarantee security after Denard and about 30
mercenaries finally agreed to leave, the statement said.
   Two of the soldiers-of-fortune have recently been seen in the
islands, the ministry said.
   Abdallah died Nov. 26 from a gunshot during a dispute with
Denard at the presidential palace. Denard admits being in the same
room but denies he was responsible.
   Denard, 61, deposed Abdallah in 1975 and returned him to power
three years later. He effectively ran the republic through a
300-man presidential guard led by Europeans.
   After three weeks of disturbances following Abdallah's death,
French paratroops landed in the Comoros and effected a transfer of
power from Denard's mercenaries.
   Most of them returned to Europe. Denard remains in South Africa,
which granted him a temporary visa.
   The mercenary cannot return to France, where he is wanted on
criminal charges for a failed 1977 coup in the West African country
of Benin.
   The three-island Comoran Republic _ with a population of about
425,000 _ is between Madagascar and Mozambique. A fourth island in
the chain, Mayotte, remains French.

<HEAD>Glass Beads Likely Cause of Columbia's Leak</HEAD>

   Glass beads found in hydrogen lines
from the space shuttle Columbia contributed to its fuel leaks, NASA
said Wednesday.
   The shuttle has been outfitted with new fuel plumbing and is
scheduled to lift off Sept. 1 carrying the Astro observatory.
   ``We've looked for contamination. We don't see any,'' said
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
   Workers on Wednesday replaced part of a valve on one of
Columbia's three main engines that wasn't working properly.
   ``We're comfortable with the hardware we have on the pad,''
Lenoir said.
   NASA scrubbed its attempt to launch Columbia on May 30 when
hydrogen leaks were detected during fueling. Atlantis also was
found to have a hydrogen leak, but in a different spot.
   Columbia's hydrogen lines were removed for inspection, and seals
on a 17-inch-diameter valve were found to leak, Lenoir said. The
valve is in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the shuttle's
external fuel tank to the main rocket engines.
   About 100 to 200 tiny glass beads were found when the seals were
disassembled, along with some metal chips, Lenoir said. NASA
officials don't know how the debris got there.
   Parker Hannifin Corp., which makes these parts, called fuel
umbilicals, at one point was using the beads for other projects in
the building where it made the shuttle parts, Lenoir said. NASA
doesn't plan to take action against the California company, he said.
   ``We've no evidence at all that says that something wrong has
been done here, that anybody's quality has escaped from us,''
Lenoir said.
   NASA plans to improve its test procedures for the disposable
external tanks to prevent similar problems in the future, Lenoir
said.
   ``Inherently, that makes it more expensive, which is why we
didn't in the first place,'' he said. ``We've no reason to believe
that our acceptance test procedure was at fault or caused any
problems. We're just trying to buy some more margin.''
   The space agency is designing a more efficient valve that should
be ready in about two years, Lenoir said.
   If larger-than-allowable leaks are detected during fueling for
the Sept. 1 launch, the mission will be called off again, Lenoir
said.

<TEXT>
   Riot police fired teargas and
shotguns Wednesday to break up student demonstrations that snarled
traffic in Panama City for several hours. Eight students were
reported injured by gunfire.
   Students from all over the capital took to the streets to
protest a Supreme Court ruling upholding a decision by the National
Institute to expel five of them for rowdy behavior.
   The Institute, a high school, dropped the students for taking
part in a street demonstration two months ago that turned into a
riot and featured the vandalism of local stores.
   As a result of Wednesday's demonstrations, Education Minister
Ada Gordon announced she had ordered the Institute closed ``until
security conditions are restored.''
   Students at the Institute told reporters at least 55 people were
hurt during clashes with police. But an official at the Social
Security emergency room, who identified himself only as Dr. Soto,
said in a telephone interview he knew of only eight who were
injured, none seriously.
   Soto said the eight were treated for superficial shotgun-pellet
wounds and allowed to leave.
   For hours, the demonstrators tied up traffic along Fourth of
July Avenue, bordering the Panama Canal, and other main
thoroughfares.
   Students from the Institute, the University of Panama, the
School of Arts, and at least a dozen other high schools threw rocks
at police trying to redirect traffic until the riot squads appeared
and dispersed the protesters.
   President Guillermo Endara, a usually easygoing politician who

student disturbances.
   Endara's predecessor, dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, was
removed by a U.S. military invasion in December and was flown to
Miami for on trial for drug trafficking and money laundering.
   ``The government has been patient and has been acting with a
very soft hand. But it must also protect citizens' rights to be on
the streets,'' he told reporters.
   ``A few youths just cannot curb their right to transit, or cause
damage to property and society. I am soft handed and I am glad that
I'm soft-handed, but the time comes when one must act,'' he added.

   Trouble-plagued NASA restored steady
radio contact with Magellan on Wednesday after losing touch with
the malfunctioning spacecraft for the second time since it started
orbiting Venus.
   Engineers received radio signals from Magellan at about 4:33
p.m. PDT showing that its secondary antenna obeyed computer orders
and was firmly pointed at Earth, allowing them to maintain a
continuous link with the wayward spaceship, said Tommy Thompson,
Magellan science manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``It took a ton off our shoulders,'' he said. ``We're going home
with smiles on our faces.''
   Intermittent contact had been restored at 12:32 p.m. PDT when a
brief ``blip'' of a radio signal was received by NASA's Deep Space
Network tracking station in Goldstone, Calif. That was about 17{
hours after contact was lost Tuesday night, laboratory spokesman
Bob MacMillin said.
   ``You could hear cheers and clapping when we reacquired the
signal,'' Thompson said.
   In an attempt to prevent further communications breakdowns,
engineers were sending additional computer commands to Magellan to
disable some of its safety systems, said Thompson. Those systems
cut off communications with Earth on Aug. 16 and again Tuesday
night when they detected some unknown problem aboard Magellan.
   The spacecraft's $744 million mission to make the best pictures
of Venus yet had been scheduled to start the first week of
September, but likely will be delayed until the problem is
diagnosed and fixed, Thompson said.
   ``The patient is resting comfortably and is strong and healthy,
but needs an operation _ and we don't know which operation right
now,'' he said of Magellan.
   The spaceship's first radio blip to Earth on Wednesday afternoon
indicated the spaceship finally had accepted repeated computer
commands to start spinning and send radio signals into space so
that some of those signals reached Earth, he added.
   Engineers received more intermittent signals before sending
Magellan orders to stop spinning and keep an antenna aimed at
Earth. Those orders restored steady radio communications.
   Earlier, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials
expressed optimism they would overcome the problem.
   ``I wouldn't say people are thrilled, but nobody's panicking.
We're very optimistic we'll be able to regain contact with the
spacecraft, figure out what's wrong and continue the mission,''
Ellen Stofan, assistant to Magellan's chief scientist, had said.
   The successful conclusion of Magellan's latest crisis averted,
at least temporarily, another severe setback for NASA.
   The agency temporarily grounded its shuttle fleet this summer
due to hydrogen fuel leaks, and also discovered the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope's performance was badly impaired by a flawed
mirror.
   Planetary scientist Steve Wall said Magellan's radio signal
fluttered in and out of contact before fading away Tuesday night,
indicating an unknown problem made the spacecraft turn so the
antenna it was using at the time no longer pointed at Earth.
   ``We do not believe anything like a massive failure occurred,''
he said.
   Venus and Magellan were almost 149 million miles from Earth on
Wednesday, Wall said. Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor, and is the
second planet from the sun.
   Magellan was designed to use radar to peer through Venus' thick
clouds to make the most detailed pictures and maps yet of the
rugged landscape, where temperatures reach 900 degrees Fahrenheit
due to an out-of-control ``greenhouse effect.''
   The spacecraft was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, then looped around the sun 1{ times, traveling 948 million
miles before it slid into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.
   Magellan first lost contact with Earth for more than 14 hours
starting the night of Aug. 16. Then its automatic safety systems
made the spacecraft spin slowly while beaming radio signals across
the skies until some reached Earth.
   That resulted in eight hours of intermittent communications.
Then engineers sent commands that restored a steady radio link.
   The safety systems didn't automatically make Magellan start
spinning when its radio link failed for the second time starting at
7 p.m. Tuesday. Wall said the signal fluttered for 13 minutes
before fading out.
   That happened less than eight hours after NASA released
Magellan's first test pictures of Venus. The pictures showed that
at least a small part of the planet's surface has been violently
shaped by quake faults and vast volcanic lava flows.
   Stofan said prime suspects as the cause of Magellan's
communications problem are defects in its computer programs or its
hardware.
   Engineers had said Tuesday the leading theory to explain last
week's outage was that Magellan's electronics were briefly
disrupted by a cosmic ray or a high-energy particle from the sun.
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory is known for designing spacecraft to
fix their own malfunctions.
   Voyager 2's main receiving antenna failed after its launch in
1977, leaving it deaf for about a week until the probe
automatically switched to a working backup receiver, laboratory
spokesman Jim Wilson said. The probe successfully completed a
12-year exploration of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune last
year.

   Military reservists got the call they had been waiting for
Wednesday, only to find out they'll have to wait even longer to see
if they'll be tapped.
   ``If the call comes, we'll go,'' said Jeffrey Smith, a New York
City accountant and Army reservist. ``Right now I'm a little
nervous. But I stand ready to go as everyone else does.''
   ``If you sign on the dotted line, you have to expect to pay the
piper,'' said Joseph Bellavia, a 43-year-old pharmaceutical
salesman from Reading, Mass. He said he's ready to go, but his
family, including eight children, doesn't want him to go.
   President Bush ordered the Pentagon on Wednesday to call
military reserves to active duty for the first time in 20 years.
   The callup includes National Guard units and Army, Navy, Air
Force and Marine Reserves. Guard troops sent previously to the
Middle East were responding to calls for volunteers rather than a
federal callup.
   Officials didn't identify the units that would be activated, or
say when they would be called.
   But a spokesman for North Carolina's National Guard said some of
its units had been called into duty. ``We are aware of units that
have been called. We are going through verification rosters,'' said
Lt. Col. Baron Hignite,
   A Pentagon statement said some reserves called to active duty
would be shipped to Saudi Arabia while others would remain in the
United States replacing troops dispatched to the Mideast.
   ``We're at the highest stage of combat readiness in our
history,'' Lt. Gen. John B. Conaway, chief of the National Guard
Bureau in Washington, told the 19th annual conference of The
Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States,
meeting in Minneapolis.
   Smith, the New York accountant, was waiting along with thousands
of other reservists to see if his unit would be called. Smith, 29,
joined the Army in April 1979 and did three years active duty. He's
been a reservist every since.
   ``Anybody who says they're not scared, they're lying,'' said
Smith.
   On the other hand, Angela Adinolfi, 22, a reservist who works at
Hanscom Air Force Base, Mass., said she ``wouldn't mind'' moving to
active duty. ``That's what we're here for,'' she said.
   Former Iranian hostage Kevin Hermening of Mosinee, Wis., a
sergeant in the Marine Reserve, is ready to go back to the Middle
East.
   ``Like other Marine reservists, my bags have been packed for the
last two weeks in preparation in case my president calls me,'' he
said.
   Hermening, the youngest of the Americans held hostage in the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran, was 20 when he was freed. Since his return,
has has had frequent speaking engagements and has run
unsuccessuflly for Congress.
   Iowa National Guard officials expected Iowa units would be
called up but said it would likely involve only a few troops.
   ``I am not anticipating that we get word this afternoon and we
leave tonight,'' said Warren Lawson, Iowa National Guard adjutant
general, who said officials generally provide for an orderly
deployment.
   ``This is what we're all about. It's like being a volunteer
fireman, you hope there's never a fire, but if there is one, you
know you're ready to deal with it,'' said Ray Martyniuk, a
spokesman for New Jersey's Department of Military and Veterans'
Affairs, which oversees the Army and Air National Guard.
   ``We're not doing anything special right now except for our
normal business, But our mission is to train for something like
this,'' said Col. Alex Garcia, deputy commander of the 111th Air
Defense Brigade in New Mexico, which includes the 744th Medical
Detachment.
   Some employers were taking stock of their personnel to determine
the effect a call-up might have on their workforces.
   FHP Health Care of Utah reported that as many as 45 of its
employees could be called to active duty.
   ``Every department is looking at how this may affect them so
they can be prepared. We will strongly support our employees while
they are there. There is strong (company) support for the American
and United Nations' positions,'' said company spokesman James W.
McPherson III.
   Master Sgt. Mary Lou Bornmann, a spokeswoman at New York City's
Fort Totten, said many reservists have contacted their commanders
volunteering for active duty. Fort Totten is headquarters of the
77th Army Reserve Command.
   ``We've had more people volunteering than we know what to do
with,'' she said. ``I don't think anybody expected this now. But
we're prepared.''
   Some units of the 77th are likely to get called _ the command,
the nation's largest, has 14,000 reservists, 6,000 of whom are in
medical companies.
   But some reservists were apprehensive about being called up.
   In Georgia, Al Beverly was wondering how he would run a
congressional campaign from the deserts of Saudi Arabia, if he's
activated.
   ``I'm not going to resign my candidacy,'' said Beverly, 36, of
Marietta, Ga., an Army reserve captain and Republican challenger to
U.S. Rep. George ``Buddy'' Darden, D-Ga. ``I have to figure where
to draw the line between being a captain and being a candidate.''
   Others were concerned about jobs and paying bills.
   ``What's going to happen to my paycheck? How am I supposed to
pay my car note?'' asked Yolanda Preston, 25, a teacher in Atlanta
and Air Force reservist. ``I can't ask them to be patient for
I-don't-know-how-many months.''
   Jonathan Waldron, a Marietta, Ga., dentist and commander of the
4th Marine Air Wing Medical Unit, said if he is summoned, he would
have to find some contingency plan for his 1,300-patient practice.
   ``I would prefer not to be called up, but I'm ready if I'm
needed,'' said Waldron, 46, a reservist for 20 years. ``The concern
I have is not for my well-being, but I've got four employees
counting on a paycheck.''

<HEAD>Archbishop Said to Stop Payments to Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Archbishop Eugene Marino has stopped
giving money to a woman with whom he had an intimate relationship
that cost him his job, a church spokesman said Wednesday.
   The woman, Vicki Long, has received $14,000 in money orders
since May from the New York town where Marino is in seclusion,
according to news reports. Marino resigned in July, citing health
problems, and the church has since acknowledged it was because of
his affair with Ms. Long, 27.
   On Wednesday the Rev. Peter Dora, a spokesman for the Atlanta
Roman Catholic Archdiocese, said Marino has stopped making payments.
   ``It is my understanding that he has not sent her any money
after the end of July and he does not intend to send her any of his
own money in the future,'' Dora said.
   The name signed on one money order to Ms. Long was ``Eugene
Bradford,'' the name of the archbishop's dead grandfather, The
Atlanta Constitution reported Wednesday. The newspaper quoted an
unnamed person close to Ms. Long who is familiar with the money
orders.
   Others were signed by two employees of the Larchmont, N.Y.,
Catholic retreat house where Marino went in May after church
officials learned of his two-year relationship with Ms. Long, a
former lay minister. On Aug. 9, Marino checked into St. Vincent's
Hospital, a psychiatric center in Harrison, N.Y., near the church
retreat house in Larchmont where he had been since resigning.
   Atlanta station WAGA-TV, quoting unidentified sources, reported
Tuesday that Ms. Long had received money orders from May 22 through
July 30. And WSB-TV in Atlanta reported an unidentified source as
saying the Ms. Long had received $1,500 in money orders from Marino
in July.
   Dora said that as archbishop, Marino's salary was $1,500 a month
and Marino is presently receiving the same amount from a pension
fund. He emphasized that the money sent to Ms. Long was Marino's
personal money.
   ``There are no diocese funds going to her a this time, there
will be no money in the future and there will be no settlement on
any claims she might make against the archdiocese in this regard,''
Dora said.
   Marino, 56, was the nation's highest-ranking black Roman
Catholic before to his resignation.
   Ms. Long, who has also said she had relationships with two other
priests and a nun, claims she and Marino were married in 1988.
   A four-member panel headed by Coca Cola President Donald R.
Keough is investigating the church's financial records to determine
if church money was improperly paid to Ms. Long.
   Church officials have acknowledged paying about $15,000 in
medical bills for Ms. Long, whose attorneys have sought additional
financial compensation, claiming that she was sexually exploited by
the archbishop. No legal action has been filed.

   East German lawmakers ended their anguished
and much-ridiculed battle over the date of unification and early
Thursday voted to merge the foundering nation with West Germany on
Oct. 3.
   Parliament burst into applause when Parliament's president,
Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, announced the ``truly historic event.''
   After an 11-hour Parliament session that lasted until Thursday's
predawn hours, lawmakers voted 294 to 62 to make Oct. 3 the day the
nation becomes part of a single Germany. Seven lawmakers abstained.
   The date was a compromise between the major factions in
Parliament after weeks of battling that tore apart the broad
coalition government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   Earlier, lawmakers rejected a proposal by the small German
Social Union party to unify immediately.
   Parliament also passed a treaty that will allow all-German
elections on Dec. 2. The West German Parliament is to vote on the
same treaty Thursday. Easy passage is expected.
   East Germany in effect has approved a clause, effective Oct. 3,
in the West Germany constitution that allows former German lands to
accede to the Western nation.
   It is a major psychological boost to a nation troubled by
economic and political chaos.
   De Maiziere urged lawmakers to accept Oct. 3 as the historic day
of German unity and end the seemingly pointless squabbling over
whether unity should take place in August, September or October.
   ``Many people have gotten the impression discussions over a date
are more important to us than the solution of crucial problems,''
he told Parliament.
   ``A binding commitment and an end to the discussion are long
overdue,'' he said.
   The weeks-long dispute was the result of a power struggle
between the Christian Democrats of de Maiziere and West German
Chacellor Helmut Kohl and the left-leaning Social Democrats in both
nations.
   The two parties are jockeying for the best political advantage
heading into Dec. 2 elections for a united German government.
   Many lawmakers acknowledged the convoluted wrangling in recent
days seemed to have lost relevance as average East Germans struggle
with rising joblessness and higher prices.
   ``I ask you, who even understands our desires?'' asked Gregor
Gysi, head of the reformed Communists, the third-largest party in
Parliament.
   The lawmakers met in special session to try to resolve
differences over the date of unity.
   The Social Democrats insisted it occur Sept. 15. As East
Germany's second-largest party, their approval is needed to pass a
unification proposal.
   De Maiziere's Christian Democrats on Wednesday as a compromise
proposed Oct. 3 as the merger date.
   Kohl's conservative government said earlier in the day that
unity could occur on East Germany's Oct. 7 birthday or one day
earlier.
   Kohl has been able to orchestrate most of the unity process.
   He and de Maiziere, his East German ally, previously backed
merging the two countries on Oct. 14, but the Social Democrats
balked.
   The Social Democrats want unity quickly so West Germany can more
quickly assume direct responsibility for East Germany's failing
economy.
   Joblessness has been climbing since East Germany converted to a
free market on July 1.
   The Social Democrats also want early unification so that Kohl
will be forced to admit the staggering costs of bailing out East
Germany and its 16 million residents. This could cost the Christian
Democrats at the polls in December.
   West Germany says it is crucial that unity not occur before the
Oct. 1-2 meeting in New York City of foreign ministers from the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   The meeting will cap a series of negotiations between the four
World War II Allies _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain
and France _ and the two Germanys on the global aspects of German
unity.
   West Germany has proposed that the results of talks on
international aspects of German unity be presented at the this
meeting.
   In those negotiations, the Soviet Union dropped its opposition
to NATO membership for a united Germany in exchange for a promise
its troops in what is now East Germany can remain there for up to
four years. Also reached was an agreement that a united Germany
would not try to claim lands forfeited to Poland after Nazi
Germany's defeat in 1945.
   Unemployment has been climbing since East Germany converted to a
free market on July 1. Factories have been unable to compete with
an invasion of Western products.
   The debate over the pace of unification and the problems with
the economy has led to the resignations or dismissals of six
ministers in de Maiziere's Cabinet the past week and the decision
by the Social Democrats to leave his coalition.
   In the end, the compromise was agreed to by the Social Democrats
and another party that earlier had left de Maiziere's coalition in
the dispute, the Liberal faction.

   Members of the Great Circus Bim Bom dejectedly
left for home Wednesday, 4{ months after the Soviet troupe ran out
of money and was stranded.
   Thirty-five members of the troupe headed for New York, where a
rival Soviet circus' promoter put up money to send them home. The
group was to leave Thursday night for Leningrad and go from there
to Moscow.
   They were part of a group of about 120 that arrived in this
country in March but ran out of funds after two performances.
   ``Good country, good people, but for me very bad,'' circus
musician Yudi Savouskin said in halting English as he boarded a Pan
Am flight out of Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   ``All of our dreams are broken,'' said Boris Rivchun, the Bim
Bom music director. ``We have nothing.''
   Not even their circus equipment. The Bim Bom entourage returned
home without it, and members faced uncertain futures in the Soviet
Union.
   ``I need my instruments back in Moscow,'' Savouskin said.
   Shortly after arriving in the United States, the circus ran into
problems with its tour promoter and its financial backers pulled
out.
   The group came to Atlanta in May, seeking to get its tour back
on the road, and began living in a series of motels, college
dormitories and church shelters while pursuing funds.
   The circus' animals were seized by creditors and are being held
in New York.
   The group left Atlanta with airline tickets paid for by Steven
E. Leber, a New York businessman who promotes the official Moscow
Circus. He said Wednesday he is putting up about $50,000 to get the
circus members home and take care of some of their U.S. financial
problems.
   Leber said members of the Bim Bom circus asked him for help.
   ``They were starving,'' he said. ``They were at the end of their
rope.''
   Leber also said that Bim Bom was being confused by some people
with his circus, and its troubles were threatening the reputation
of the Moscow Circus.
   Leber said he previously had helped 27 members of Bim Bom, who
had gone to Las Vegas, return home. Leber and circus members at the
airport didn't know how many of their colleagues planned to stay
behind and try to find work.

   Nicaragua's legislature on Wednesday
defeated a bill from President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro asking
pardons for at least five men involved in the 1978 murder of her
publisher husband.
   The National Assembly rejected by a 51-30 vote, with eight
abstentions, the bill submitted by Mrs. Chamorro last Thursday. She
had sought the pardons as part of her campaign to pacify her
war-scarred nation.
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the popular publisher of the afternoon
newspaper La Prensa, was ambushed and shot to death by gunmen on a
Managua street on his way to work Jan. 10, 1978.
   The assassination set violent protests that rallied opposition
groups around the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front. The
Sandinistas then overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza in July 1979
and seized power.
   A decade of war between the Sandinistas and U.S.-backed Contra
rebels followed in which tens of thousands died. Mrs. Chamorro
succeeded Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega on April 25, after
winning elections in a rout three months earlier.
   Five men were arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced from 20
to 31 years imprisonment for Pedro Joaquin Chamorro's murder, which
was widely believed to have been carried out on orders from the
Somoza regime.
   But Mrs. Chamorro's bill, as sent to the legislature, could also
extend pardons to suspects from the Somoza regime who had planned
the assassination.
   Until Mrs. Chamorro took office, La Prensa was Nicaragua's only
opposition newspaper and her husband is still fondly remembered by
people for exposing corruption and human rights abuses under Somoza.
   Although the Contra war has ended, Nicaraguans remain bitterly
split over many national issues, the economy is still in tatters
and the Sandinistas are the country's single biggest party.
   Assembly Speaker Miriam Arguello called for secret balloting
Wednesday so that the controversial pardon issue could be voted
freely across party lines.
   Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party United National Opposition coalition,
ranging on the political spectrum from hard-line conservatives to
Communists and Socialists, holds 51 seats in the 92-member
legislature.
   The Sandinistas have 39 and the Revolutionary Movement Union and
the Social Christian Party one each.

   Former Black Panther revolutionary
Johnny Spain, who was freed from prison by a court order two years
ago, was formally found suitable for parole Wednesday by a state
panel.
   But Spain's confusing struggle with state parole authorities
isn't over. One member of the panel that voted 2-1 to ratify his
earlier release said she would refer his case to the full state
parole board for review.
   It is unclear what would happen if the parole board declared
Spain unfit for release, since he has already been freed by a state
judge's order.
   Board of Prison Terms spokeswoman Phyllis Scott said her agency
was considering the matter, despite the court decisions, because
``the board has never made a decision on suitability for parole and
the board is responsible for determining suitability.''
   Spain, 41, who was originally imprisoned for a 1966 murder and
was later involved in a bloody uprising at San Quentin prison, has
taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford
University, and lectured elsewhere in the two years since his
release.
   He also works at a social service agency for the disabled and
homeless in Richmond.
   Following nearly two hours of deliberation, David Brown, the
chairman of the three-member parole panel, said the ruling was
largely because Spain has functioned ``as a law-abiding and
productive citizen'' since his release. A state judge ordered him
freed in 1988 after he served 21 years of his murder sentence.
   Panel member Maureen O'Connell cast the no vote.
   Spain's attorney said after the hearing that O'Connell also
referred the issue to the full State Parole Board, which triggers
an automatic review of the panel's decision.
   During the hearing, the prosecution's representative, Deputy Los
Angeles District Attorney Mark Vezzoni, argued that Spain shouldn't
be paroled because he is capable of further violence.
   ``Americans are hopelessly romantic. They glorify criminals with
time. The blood of their victims seems to turn to dust and blow
away with time,'' Vezzoni told the panel.
   But Spain said he had demonstrated his suitability for parole.
   He told the panel members he was irritated with some of their
questions because they appeared antagonistic. But he said he
demonstrated his maturity by keeping his temper.
   Spain's original conviction was for killing a man during a
robbery attempt at a bus stop.
   He allegedly was involved in an escape attempt on Aug. 21, 1971,
with fellow San Quentin inmate and Black Panther leader George
Jackson. Three prisoners, including Jackson, and three guards were
killed.
   Spain was convicted in 1976 of the murders of two guards
although he didn't directly participate in the killings.
   But the conviction was thrown out after federal courts found
that Spain didn't get a fair trial. The state prison terms board,
which had previously cited the San Quentin uprising in denying
parole, was told by the courts that it could no longer consider
that.
   Spain's attorney, Dennis Riordan, accused Vezzoni of making
thinly veiled references to the San Quentin uprising at the hearing.
   Responding to questions from parole board members, Spain said he
was remorseful about the murder, disputed the panel's
characterization of him as a former drug abuser, and blamed
numerous prison conduct violations in the 1970s largely on being
forced to wear restraints every time he left his cell.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with four grafs to UPDATE with Rios Montt seeking
reversal, quotes. Picks up 3rd pvs, `Election board...'</NOTE>

   The national election board on Wednesday
barred former dictator Jose Efrain Rios Montt from running for
president in elections scheduled for Nov. 11.
   The conservative three-party coalition supporting the retired
general's candidacy has three days to appeal through the courts,
and Rios Montt said he will try to have the decision reversed.
   ``We didn't expect this. ... I didn't expect it but we are
prepared to continue playing the game,'' Rios Montt told a news
conference after the ruling was announced.
   He called it ``a decision by group of citizens who are unaware
of what the true rule of law is.''
   Election board director Felix Castillo Milla announced the
decision at a heavily guarded news conference. He said the ruling
was based on provisions in the Guatemalan Constitution.
   In its resolution rejecting Rios Montt's candidacy, the election
board said ``neither the head and leaders of a coup, armed
revolution or similar movement that has altered the constitutional
order, nor those who have assumed the head of government as a
result, can run for president or vice-president of the republic.''
   The Supreme Court, in a nonbinding opinion sought by Congress
last year, said Rios Montt cannot be president or vice president
because of a constitutional ban on the holding of those posts by
people who assumed power in a coup.
   Rios Montt took power after a March 1982 military coup that
overthrew President Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia. As president, he
sent more than a dozen leftists before firing squads, including
five during a visit by Pope John Paul II.
   Rios Montt ruled until August 1983 when the army replaced him
with Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia.
   Rios Montt was nominated to run for president by the Democratic
Institutional Party, National Unity Front and Guatemalan Republican
Front.
   A born-again Christian, Rios Montt campaigned on a tough
law-and-order platform, making a good showing in early polls among
voters concerned about the country's rising crime rate.
   Human rights workers have worried that Rios Montt's
eye-for-an-eye brand of justice would lead to further abuses in a
country already plagued with them. So far the only candidate
qualified by the election board to run in the presidential race is
former Guatemala City Mayor Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen of the National
Advance Party.
   The election board has yet to rule on the applications of at
least seven other candidates, including Jorge Carpio Nicolle, whose
name was submitted by the National Center Union and the National
Authentic Central.
   Nicolle, a journalist, lost in 1986 to incumbent President
Vinicio Cerezo.
   Candidates have until Sept. 12 to register. The winner of the
election will replace Cerezo, who succeeded Mejia after being
elected to a five-year term in January 1986.
   There will be a runoff on Jan. 6 if no candidate wins a majority
in the Nov. 11 election.

   The Bush administration's decision to add more
F-15 fighters and heavy tanks to Saudi Arabia's defensive shield
against Iraq has an additional benefit, officials say: drawing the
once-resistant Arab nation closer to the West.
   International cooperation in the bid to reverse Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait has opened doors long closed to Washington, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said Tuesday as he returned from a four-day
trip to the Persian Gulf.
   ``I think the degree of cooperation today _ in terms of U.S.
military presence and a collective security effort _ obviously is
far greater than it has ever been before,'' Cheney said.
   Because the threat from Iraq is so serious to the moderate Arab
rulers in the gulf region, Cheney said, ``Nations that previously
have had sort of an arms-length relationship with the U.S. military
are eager to cooperate with and support our efforts in the region,
and the efforts of the other nations involved.''

   In Cleveland, an Egyptian grocer involved in a minor dispute

   Nearly three weeks after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait, the first signs are showing of a gathering economic
crisis in the developing world.
   In Nepal, there's a run on gasoline, and gas prices have
increased 50 percent in Zambia. Sri Lanka is worried about access

   Scores of oil-poor and cash-strapped nations face inflation,
slower growth and increased debt after Iraq invaded Kuwait, causing
crude prices to rise from about $20 a barrel to more than $25.
   The worst hit are the smaller and poorer nations of the world,
for whom increasing oil prices and U.N. sanctions on trade with
Iraq and Kuwait will drastically disrupt their already tenuous

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fall of communism has brought a sense
of unraveling to the Balkans, where the new democracy holds fragile
sway over emotional peoples tormented by ancient ethnic hatreds.
   Long-suppressed nationalism and economic backwardness bedevil
the transition throughout the former Soviet bloc, but nowhere is
the danger of national dissolution or even armed conflict so great
as in the Balkans.
   Balkan peoples have little tradition of democracy and have
endured centuries of brutal outside domination.
   They are fiercely proud of their ethnicity and often settle
scores in blood. Scars inflicted by the past are as fresh as if
incurred yesterday. The thirst for revenge runs deep.
   ``The past hangs over the whole of politics, as elsewhere in
Europe, with the difference that in the Balkans, there has never
been a juridical arrangement of all these matters,'' said Nikolai
Todorov, one of Bulgaria's foremost experts on the region.
   ``The heritage is very difficult to overcome, because there are
compact masses of nationalities which were included in new states
built on the national principle,'' he said, alluding to such
minorities as Bulgaria's 1 million ethnic Turks, the 2 million
Hungarians in Romania and the scattered ethnic groups of Yugoslavia.
   Before communism arrived, Balkan borders were shifted constantly
by battles between outside rulers, often in the names of their
religions: the Orthodox south Slavs; the Ottoman Turks, Moslems who
dominated the southern Balkans for centuries, and the Hapsburgs,
Roman Catholics from the north.
   In World War II, fought in most of Europe as a struggle between
democracy and dictatorship, Balkan countries gained and lost
territory at the whim of outside powers. In Yugoslavia, about 1
million people were killed in largely fratricidal conflict.
   As recently as 1989, old hatreds drove 300,000 ethnic Turks from
Bulgaria. It was Europe's biggest emigration in 40 years.
   Balkan peoples _ accustomed to violence, far from Western Europe
and often isolated in mountain valleys even from one another _
traditionally have felt secure only in the very ethnic
consciousness that nurtures more conflict.
   Religion, a folk song, one's land or village exercise a greater
hold because they have proved more lasting than the different
masters of this strikingly beautiful region.
   Added to the mystical sense of ethnicity are the legacies of
great empires. At one spot in central Sofia, an Orthodox church, a
mosque, a Lenin statue and a sleek Sheraton hotel face one another.
   Bulgarians must untangle a complex heritage of Ottoman and
Soviet repression and Orthodox acquiescence in the status quo in
order to make reality of the very different jargon of democracy,
human rights and market economy.
   New concepts of freedom, and the watchword ``Europe,'' are
invoked almost as if they could magically overcome the burdens of
history and economic backwardness, transforming the Balkans
instantly into France.
   The political impossibility of such rapid change is obvious even
in such tangibly European cities as Ljubljana, capital of Slovenia,
the northern Yugoslav republic next to Austria and Italy.
   ``Nationalism is only part of the problem,'' a Slovenian
journalist said, on condition of anonymity. ``There is also the
politics of small nations.''
   Among the Slovenes, who number just under 2 million, almost all
prominent politicians, businessmans, journalists and intellectuals
know each other. Graft and intrigue can flourish in such tight
circles, as they traditionally did in the Hapsburg empire, to which
Slovenia belonged for centuries.
   Circumstances like that make it difficult for the often
Europeanized intellectuals of the Balkans to follow the East
European tradition of doubling as far-sighted politicians.
   Romania, for instance, has suffered since its revolution in
December from the refusal of most leading intellectuals to join any
political party.
   An outspoken, independent media, virtually nonexistent in the
Balkans, is just one aspect of democracy difficult to achieve.
   The media often inflame passions rather than soothe them,
especially in Yugoslavia, whose fragile federation of six
quarrelsome republics seems destined to dissolve.
   A print war many fear will lead to shooting is being waged
between Serbia, the largest republic and the only one where
Communist leaders refuse free elections, and Croatia, which elected
a center-right government in March.
   Serbia has demonstrated a readiness to get tough by its actions
in Kosovo, a southern province that was the heart of ancient Serbia
and now is dominated by ethnic Albanians. Serbia claims they seek
union with neighboring Albania.
   At least 60 ethnic Albanians have been killed in confrontations
with security forces. Ethnic Albanian media and institutions have
been virtually eliminated.
   Such tactics by Serbia have encouraged the efforts of relatively
prosperous Slovenia and Croatia, both Roman Catholic parts of the
old Hapsburg empire, to draw away from the rest of Yugoslavia.
   Repression in Kosovo also could prove dangerous if democratic
reform took hold in Albania. The province's ethnic Albanians, about
85 percent of the population, then could press in earnest for union
with brothers across the border.
   Romania and Bulgaria face the problem of sharing power with
minorities at the political level, where daily life is largely
determined.
   Bulgaria holds its first free local elections in October. Ethnic
Turks are expected to win in Kurdzhali and other towns that were
paralyzed this summer by strikes of ethnic Bulgarians who feared
Turkish domination.
   In Romania, local elections scheduled for next year could give
Hungarians control of Transylvania, the western region adjacent to
Hungary.
   Whether the Romanian elections even will be held remains a
question. There are increasing rumors in Bucharest that the army is
preapring to take over.
   Economic chaos everywhere in the Balkans feeds fears of a rapid
slide away from democracy.
   Ante Markovic, the federal premier of Yugoslavia, has curbed
inflation but the newly convertible dinar is overvalued and prices
in some areas are higher than in Austria, although pay averages
only $280 a month.
   Reduced Soviet oil shipments and the latest Middle East crisis
have caused an energy crunch in Bulgaria and Romania. Both
introduced rationing of sugar and other staples in August, and
everyone seems to expect a hard winter.

   Three friends whose ethnic groups
hate each other were having coffee together, watching what little
of the world passes by in this sleepy village on the Hungarian
border.
   They chatted amiably _ a Serb, a Croat and an Albanian belying
the centuries-old tendency of their fellows to be at each other's
throats for ethnic and religious reasons.
   To Yugoslav media and politicians, the internal conflict is the
culmination of a power struggle building since the death in 1980 of
Josip Tito, who founded communist Yugoslavia and ruled it for 35
years.
   How it comes out will determine whether the six divergent
republics stick together or Yugoslavia becomes the first country in
postwar Europe to split up.
   For Mladen Kresic, the Serb, and his two friends, tension is
more personal: who spits at whom and which old acquaintances turn
their backs.
   ``At this point, it's a confrontation between individuals; it's
not a confrontation between two groups,'' he said, speaking of
Serbs and Croats.
   Kresic, a 44-year-old auto mechanic, said he could not recall
another time when tension was so high in Branjin Vrh, a mainly
Croatian village in a Serb-dominated area of Croatia.
   ``Anything could happen,'' he said, and sighed.
   Serbs and Croats are the two largest ethnic groups in
Yugoslavia. Relations between them have grown worse since Croatia,
the second-largest republic, held free elections in April.
   Elections in three other republics this fall are expected to
exacerbate ethnic tensions and political divisions.
   The center-right Croatian Democratic Union won Croatia's
elections. The Communist leaders of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest
republic, accuse the party of being too nationalistic.
   Abiding divisions lend heat to the debate.
   Croats, ruled by the Hapsburgs for centuries, are Roman Catholic
and write in Latin script. Serbs, dominated by Ottoman Turks for
more than 500 years, are Orthodox and use Cyrillic script.
   Media in the two republics argue everything from who killed who
in the estimated 1 million deaths from fratricidal fighting during
World War II to how to divide economic spoils, redraw borders or
develop democracy.
   ``We have to solve several problems at once,'' said Stjepo
Martinovic, executive editor of Fnesnik, Croatia's main daily
newspaper.
   ``As in, say, Czechoslovakia, there are the questions of
culture, parliamentary democracy and a market economy.
   ``But here we have two other big questions: the position of the
republics and the national question, which hasn't been solved.
During the Socialist period . . . it officially didn't exist.''
   In Beli Manastir, a Serbian town down the road from Branjin Vrh,
Judge Tihomir Stojanovic said: ``There is no democracy; there is
only nationalism.''
   Nationalist feeling, rising throughout the old Soviet bloc, is
particularly dangerous in Yugoslavia, where pockets of one
nationality, like Croatia's half- million Serbs, are scattered
through the feuding republics.
   The idea of Yugoslavia as a federation uniting the scattered
southern Slavic groups gave Stojanovic and other Serbs in Croatia a
feeling of security. They could be Yugoslavs first, then Serbs.
   For Croatians like Neven Jurica, a leader of the Croatian
Democratic Union, Yugoslavia was an institution that denied Croats
full sovereignty over their affairs and money.
   He confidently outlined plans for a new Croatian constitution to
be presented in October. He has no doubt it will pass the Croation
parliament, which his party dominates.
   ``It's a complete change of Yugoslavia as it currently exists,''
Jurica said. ``The Yugoslav idea is only based on ideological
theses. It is definitely dead.''
   A new Yugoslavia can be based only on a new agreement of common
interests, he said, echoing the views of the new center-right
government in neighboring Slovenia.
   To protect themselves from what they see as rising Croatian
nationalism, many Serbs living in Croatia joined a new political
party. Slobodan Milosevic, the Communist leader of Serbia, even
talks of demanding a border change to protect Croatia's Serbs.
   Milosevic and the Slovenes have quarreled for two years over
democracy and Serbia's repressive treatment of the ethnic Albanian
majority in its province of Kosovo, the ancient Serb heartland.
   Most political observers say the newer conflict between the
Serbian Communist leaders and the new Croatian government will
decide Yugoslavia's fate.
   In Branjin Vrh, 17-year-old Dalibor Hosovic, a Croat, said he
wished there were no differences, but that weddings always make
them clear:
   ``When they sing a Croatian song, you see who is Croat and who
is Serb. It's the expression on their faces.''

   Wolfram Grimm was 20 when he
signed on at the big potassium mine outside this grimy industrial
city. At 46, he's out of work, like hundreds of thousands of other
East Germans.
   ``I really don't know what I'm going to do now,'' he said,
standing in a long line at the Bitterfeld employment office. ``I
don't deserve this kind of treatment after 26 years of sweat and
hard work.''
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany promised no East German
would be made worse off by the July 1 economic merger of the two
countries.
   Whatever the promises, there are people like Grimm all over the
formerly communist East, hard workers who have been demoralized by
losing their jobs and seeing prices of nearly everything zoom
upward.
   East German officials say more than 1.2 million people, about 10
percent of the working population, are either out of work or on
drastically reduced hours.
   Experts say East Germany will climb out of its economic morass
as inefficient plants close and capitalism takes hold. That's
little comfort to those being forced to make the first sacrifices
in return for a promise of prosperity that could be years in coming.
   Social problems are growing in tandem with the hard times.
   Jobless youths loiter or lean against store fronts, drinking
vodka or beer.
   Crime was rare under the Stalinists, partly because of the
fearsome secret police, since abolished. Now, regular police have
trouble keeping up with theft alone.
   ``It's everything from pickpocketing to thieves cutting the
straps of ladies' pocketbooks,'' said said Dietmar Kiehne, police
spokesman in Bitterfeld, 60 miles south of Berlin. ``These are not
things we are accustomed to.''
   While old, inefficient plants fail, many East Germans rise to
the challenge of unification. Shops and businesses are springing up
all over the country. Craftsmen who worked for state-owned
enterprises now work for themselves.
   Budding capitalists face many obstacles, however.
   Ingo Jung helps run a used car lot in Bitterfeld, offering
Volkswagens, BMWs and other cars bought in West Germany.
   Business was brisk in the first few days of economic union, when
his fellow East Germans had wallets stuffed with West German marks,
but caution soon prevailed.
   ``A lot of people are really afraid they're going to lose their
jobs, so they're cutting way back on what they spend,'' Jung said.
   The economic woes are many.
   Western investors, wary of antiquated, heavily indebted
operations, are not rushing to help rescue East German companies as
Bonn had predicted.
   Industrial production is plummeting. According to the West
German central bank, East German output in the second quarter of
this year fell 9.5 percent from the same period a year ago.
   Coffee and electronic goods are cheaper since July 1, but prices
of many basic goods have increased enormously. West Germany's
Economics Ministry said East German bread prices rose 122 percent
in a month and postal rates went up 230 percent.
   Workers are striking for job security and East Germany's
economic problems are beginning to burden West Germany.
   West Germany already provides huge amounts of financial aid, but
more is needed. Bonn will have to provide an extra $4.5 billion to
cover programs for the ever-growing number of jobless East Germans.
   Initial West German predictions were that unemployment in the
East would reach 440,000 by the end of 1990. It now appears the
number will surpass 1 million, not including people on reduced
hours.
   Highly industrialized cities like Bitterfeld suffer most.
Thousands of workers have been laid off or given short hours in its
soft coal and potassium mines, film-making factory and giant Chemie
AG chemical complex.
   Many big industries, like Chemie AG, are in economic limbo along
with their employees. Of its 16,000 workers, 5,000 are on short
hours.
   The company has ecological as well as economic problems. The
Bitterfeld complex, formerly known as CKB, has been one of Europe's
worst polluters, dumping raw chemical waste into streams that feed
the Elbe River.
   It would cost a fortune to raise Chemie AG to Western
environmental standards. Several of the complex's operations
already have closed and others probably will follow.
   Company officials say staff will have to be cut drastically if
it is to attract investors who can turn Chemie AG into a
profitable, ecologically safe operation.
   Asked to assess the firm's future, company officer Wolfgang
Koppehel said: ``We think it will survive, but certainly not
without pain.''

   There is a small village north of
Albuquerque where people wait all summer to hear a siren's wail.
   It is a call to action for the Indians of Pueblo Jemez, renowned
for their ability to fight wildfires. Somewhere, there is a fire,
and the first ones to reach the town's community center will be
hired to fight it.
   ``Everybody, whether they're naked or eating or whatever, has to
run. That's when the physical training comes in handy,'' said
Lawrence Tosa, who coordinates the Jemez crews.
   Similar crews from Navajo, Hopi, Apache, Zuni and smaller tribes
are called upon each year as fires flare across the country.
Wildfires that closed Yosemite Park for the first time in its
history were battled by crews that included Apaches from eastern
Arizona.
   Other recent California fires have been fought by Northern
Cheyenne, Acoma, Santo Domingo, Taos, Mescalero and Navajo crews,
said Dennis Orrick, fire intelligence officer for the state
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
   The Indians do everything from digging fire lines to lugging
water pumps.
   ``They're invaluable to us. If they were not available, we'd
have real difficulty finding other people to fill that void,'' said
Lee Singer, public affairs officer for the Cibola National Forest.
   ``They're really known for their ability to work, their
endurance,'' said Ray Kirgan, a fire management officer for the
Bureau of Indian Affairs.
   ``They come from the mountain region. They are hunters, they do
woodcutting, they've fought bears in the woods. They know how to do
the work without being told. It's almost automatic,'' he said.
   Kirgan, 51, should know. An Apache firefighter for 30 years, he
still can pass the strenuous step test, a physical fitness
requirement.
   Indians always have been firefighters on their own land, but it
wasn't until after World War II that they turned to firefighting
for the U.S. government as a source of income.
   ``People were back from the war and employment was down,'' said
Kirgan. ``They were living off the land and they were trying to get
some income. So they started organizing.''
   The Mescaleros Apaches of southern New Mexico were the first
Indian firefighters to be exported when they were sent to help
battle a California fire in 1948, Kirgan said. The Bureau of Indian
Affairs trained them, gave them hard hats and sent them to work
alongside the Forest Service crews.
   They were so good that ``other states just started calling,''
Kirgan said. In New Mexico each spring, 150 to 200 Mescalero
Apaches apply for firefighting jobs. About 50 are hired and go
through three days of training; they then are on call 24 hours a
day. If called to a fire, they may work 12- to 16-hour shifts for
14 days without a break. Base pay is $7.98 an hour.
   It's seasonal, undependable and dangerous work, but for Indians
like Clemente Toledo, summer firefighting is an important source of
income.
   ``You make more money in fewer hours, at a faster pace,'' said
Toledo, 32, who grows corn and chili on his farm and works at odd
construction jobs. Like most Indian reservations and pueblos, Jemez
suffers high unemployment.
   Toledo, slim and muscular, is a crew boss responsible for
coordinating about 15 men at a fire. In five years, he has been
sent to fires in Northern California, Tennessee, West Virginia and
elsewhere.
   He spent 29 days in Oregon in 1988: ``There was a lot of work, a
lot of hours, and the food was great. We were there for 29 days. On
my two days of R&amp;R, I toured the coastline, ate pizza and got
T-shirts made for the crew.''
   The Jemez crews, known as the Eagles, achieved national fame in
the 1950s and 1960s when they were recognized as the top
firefighters in the country.
   There has been one major change since that time: In Jemez and
elsewhere, women began joining the firefighting ranks in the late
1970s.
   Reyes Panana, 29, a mother of three who has been separated from
her husband for more than a year, joined the Jemez roster this fire
season after waiting for several years. She's one of 15 women
firefighters.
   The issue of women's rights didn't influence her decision to try
her hand at firefighting, she said. She just needed a job.
   And the men don't treat the women firefighters any differently,
she said.
   ``We enjoy ourselves when we get back to camp. We talk to each
other. We share. We work together,'' she said.
   When her grandfather died in 1982, Panana, a ninth-grade
dropout, looked for a way to feed and clothe her children. She took
up pottery, which she sells to tourists. But pottery doesn't bring
in much money; firefighting does.
   ``At first, my kids were scared for me to go to a fire. . . .
They started crying that first fire,'' she said.
   They had heard about the deaths of four Jemez firefighters in a
1986 car accident at an Idaho forest fire, and ``They thought I
wasn't going to come back,'' she said.
   ``Now they're excited because of the money I've been bringing
home and the things I've been buying them. I bought them bunkbeds,
clothes and shoes.''
   Tosa said his firefighters don't get hazard pay or benefits, and
he wishes they did. But, he's quick to add, ``If they went out
there for the money, they would sit around all day doing nothing
and get the same money.
   ``They are professionals. They have pride in what they're doing.
It's a family sort of attitude. They all put in the same effort,''
he said.
   ``The only reward I really hope for and pray for is to bring all
my people home standing on their own two feet. And the faces I see
on payday.''

   All the big kids want to play at Ira's place.
   Ira _ that's Ira Gallen, age 39-and-holding _ collects old
movies, cartoons and commercials for profit. His 2,000 toys are
strictly for fun.
   Visitors gape when they enter his 4{-room apartment-office, a
baby boomer's fantasyland of toys and cartoon collectibles, mostly
from the 1950s and '60s.
   ``I consider myself one of the greatest collectors of garbage in
the country,'' says Gallen, and his foyer alone holds dozens of
cherished pieces of ``garbage'': a Popeye dime bank, Howdy Doody
hat and playing cards, porcelain Tom-and-Jerry figures.
   ``It's memory flashes: of me and my neighbor, Ricky, playing in
the backyard. Baby boomers are all middle-aged, now,'' he says
wistfully.
   ``It was an age of innocence. I grew up with a Donna Reed mother
and a father who was a cross between `Father Knows Best' and `Danny
Thomas.' ''
   Gallen's living-room walls are lined with shelves. But the
hundreds of books _ Charles Dickens volumes, television and movie
history tomes _ are hidden behind the Alvin, Bugs Bunny, Pebbles
and Bozo bubble-bath bottles . . .
   Behind the Casper the Ghost jack-in-the-box, Superman thermos
bottle, Davy Crockett lunchbox and Chatty Cathy doll . . .
   Behind boxes of ``Breakfast With Barbie'' cereal and ``Bing
Crosby Ice Cream''; the Pez Wonder Woman, Sylvester, Bugs Bunny and
Lucy . . .
   ``I had a lot of these as a kid; I broke them all,'' says the
Brooklyn native. ``Now, I'm going after every toy I ever wanted as
a kid. Now, I'm like Mr. Authority, giving lectures on prices.''
   Not that the toys are for sale. ``They're mine,'' he says,
pouting.
   When visitors spot their favorites, ``It's like I'm their father
confessor; they want to talk about their past,'' says Gallen.
   Rona Gallen, Ira's sister and general manager of his company,
Video Resources, says she can accurately guess people's ages by the
toys they gravitate toward.
   Ms. Gallen, who puts her own age at ``Patty Play Pal,'' says her
brother ``used to go with my kids to buy toys, but buy them for
himself.''
   ``My brother just doesn't want to grow up,'' she says fondly.
   ``I just love collecting,'' Gallen says with a shrug. ``Without
a new toy each month, I just panic.''
   He's been that way since he was 16; he collected 16mm films
then. After college, he worked on the crews of such movies as
``Death Wish,'' ``Harry and Tonto'' and ``Three Days of the
Condor.''
   The toys entered his life at age 20. He walked past a store full
of antique toys that was going out of business. He ``bought the
place out'' and has been picking up toys here and there ever since.
   At age 30, he chucked show business and founded Video Resources,
considered one of the industry's top tracers and restorers of lost
and damaged commercials, cartoons and programs from the Golden Age
of Television. He has 10,000 commercials _ most of them,
mercifully, in a warehouse.
   Gallen, who considers himself ``a poor man's Ted Turner,'' also
produces ``Biograph Days, Biograph Nights,'' a public-access cable
program featuring old TV clips, lectures on collectibles, and media
industry leaders _ interviewed in his living room, surrounded by
toys.
   One of his program's sponsors pays him in cash and toys.
   The show has a cult following, and Gallen carries yo-yos to give
to fans who approach him on the street.
   He produces ``Biograph'' and other projects in his apartment.
The video library and editing room is 25 feet long; a shelf
stretches across two walls, lined with toy robots.
   Gallen seems happiest there, watching the old commercials.
Barefoot and in jeans, he sings along with a 1954 RCA Picture Tube
commercial, then launches into a hearty, ``He's feeling his
Cheerios!''
   In the next room, his sister fields phone orders for videos of
old TV clips. It looks like any office: desk, computer, copy
machine . . . Popeye and Olive Oil puppets, framed Pinocchio
picture . . .
   Betty Boop doll and clock . . .
   Steve Canyon jet helmet . . .
   ``Have Gun, Will Travel'' board game . . .

   They consider themselves modern-day
disciples of Jesus Christ, but they wear cloth of a different kind.
   T-shirts, jeans, tattoos and Harley-Davidson motorcycles are
their priestly uniforms and spreading the word of God to outlaw
bikers is their mission.
   Guy Girratono, Robert Kaps and the Rev. Dale Crofford have been
bikers since their youth and each has had his share of trouble.
   Girratono served time for armed bank robbery and assault;
Crofford served time for assault with intent to kill; Kaps rode
aimlessly around Oklahoma, moving from one job to another.
   It wasn't until they reached the lowest point in their lives
that they ``found God,'' they say, through people who cared. In
turn, they seek to bring Jesus into the hearts of motorcycle gangs.
   ``I just have a real heart for these people. I lived that life
in my younger years and I got saved,'' said the bearded Crofford,
dressed in a Harley-Davidson t-shirt, jeans and heavy work boots _
an outfit similar to what he wears when he preaches to his
congregation at the Wellington Holy Christian Fellowship Church in
Wellington, Mo.
   ``I believe that you can be a Christian and be you and this is
what I am,'' said Crofford, 48. When not preaching, Crofford works
in a motorcycle shop in the Kansas City area.
   ``I just believe that these guys and girls out there need to
know that God loves them exactly where they're at,'' he said. ``We
can be Christians, ride motorcycles, love God and still dress this
way.''
   For years, Crofford wore a suit and tie on the pulpit but felt
awkward.
   ``What does a preacher look like, anyway? I don't know,'' he
said.``I believe that if (Saint) Peter would have lived in this day
and age he would have been a biker. That's the kind of man he was.''
   The three men spend many weekends attending bikers rallies
across Missouri. They hold outdoor services, each contributing his
unique talent.
   Crofford, knowledgeable about the Bible, preaches the Gospel.
Kaps, a baritone, sings the hymns. Girratono, a diplomat of sorts,
preaches and uses his contacts with gang leaders to give the three
a safe haven in the biker's camps.
   Girratono, 51, said he has spent years cultivating the leaders
of outlaw bike clubs in Kansas City so the three can move freely
within those circles.
   ``I can move in their rallies, in their groups, in their
festivities without a threat of reprisal of any kind,'' Girratono
said. ``They know me; they respect me and I have their blessing, so
to speak.''
   Some biker gangs treat their ministry with indifference, others
with curiosity.
   ``I've had some who have come to me and cried,'' Crofford said.
``I've had some who have come to me and said `I want to change but
I don't know how.' I've had some who've said `I'm not going to go
to a religious blankety-blank church.'
   ``The important thing is that we're there to help if they have a
need.''
   During many bikers rallies, club members often indulge in drugs
and alcohol, Girratono said. ``We want to introduce them to a
better way of life _ a life free from the bondage of alcohol or
drugs and illicit sex.''
   Once a biker shows an interest in their message, the second part
of their mission begins _ preparing bikers to withstand persecution
and getting mainstream churches to accept them, tattoos and all.
   ``Even if a person comes to Christ from this biking community,
for that man to walk into a church next Sunday morning and sit down
and receive the word of God like anybody else off the street is not
going to happen in most cases,'' Girratono said.
   ``We hope to give them a good enough grounding so they are not
hurt. Their emotions are very delicate.''
   The three also hope to convince mainline churches to receive
these kinds of people. Rejection by the church is a familiar and
painful feeling for Kaps.
   Lonely and down on his luck at the age of 19, Kaps walked into a
Tulsa, Okla., church, looking as he does today _ wearing a ragged
T-shirt, jeans and work boots.
   One of the church members told him to clean up and put on a tie.
He was taken by the elbow and escorted out of the church.
   It was some time before he made his way back to a church.
   When not attending biker's rallies, the three often participate
in community activities to benefit the less fortunate.
   In March, they joined more than 450 bikers on a 100-mile charity
ride to benefit the homeless. The bikers donated more than $23,000
to the City Union Mission in Kansas City, a privately funded
homeless shelter.

<HEAD>Remembering Pitfalls of Iranian Hostage Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush was running for president and vice
president while Jimmy Carter struggled with the hostage stalemate
in Iran. Now, facing an even more perilous hostage crisis, Bush
clearly is mindful of policy pitfalls he saw and criticized a
decade ago.
   While there are parallels, there is a major difference: in
confronting Iraq, the administration has international backing,
Arab allies and United Nations sanctions. Carter didn't.
   This Persian Gulf crisis began over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
and developed into a hostage situation as well. President Bush
dropped the semantic shield on Monday and said that foreigners
detained in Kuwait and Iraq clearly are hostages. Until then, the
administration had avoided using the word.
   ``I will hold the government of Iraq responsible for the safety
and well being of American citizens held against their will,'' Bush
said. The Carter administration had held Iran responsible for the
Tehran hostages, taken when radical students stormed and seized the
U.S. embassy.
   That crisis began exactly one year before the 1980 election that
Carter lost to Ronald Reagan. Iran freed the hostages as President
Reagan and Vice President Bush took office in 1981. The stalemate
dominated Carter's last year in office and became a politically
crippling symbol of impotence. The Carter administration fashioned
the deal that got them out; Reagan got the benefit.
   The Bush administration wants no replay in this Middle East
confrontation.
   Carter stuck close to the White House early in the embassy
hostage crisis. Bush clearly is determined that he will not be
confined to quarters because of the situation in the Persian Gulf.
So he is vacationing aggressively, golfing, fishing, boating at
Kennebunkport, Maine, between crisis conferences and telephone
calls. Bush also is campaigning for Republicans in this fall's
elections.
   ``It's important for the American people to see that he's not
holed up in the White House, as has happened in the past,'' press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, recalling Carter's reaction to the
seizure of the Tehran embassy hostages.
   In 1980, Bush criticized Carter for not acting sternly enough
soon enough against Iran. As a candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, he became a prime critic of the Democratic
White House, breaking out of what had been an informal political
truce on the hostage issue.
   He advocated economic warfare against Iran, a break in
diplomatic relations, and military action. He supported the rescue
mission ordered by Carter, even though it had failed. ``I hope he
takes further action and I hope he takes it today,'' Bush said
after the abortive rescue attempt.
   He favored sanctions, said he would support a blockade.
   Some of the steps Bush urged upon the Democratic White House
then are steps taken now against Iraq for its takeover of Kuwait,
an economic embargo chief among them. Some are not options this
time.
   In this hostage crisis, the regime of Saddam Hussein is
scattering Americans and other westerners at military and
industrial sites that could be targets in an air strike, trying to
use captured civilians as a shield against attack.
   The sheer number of civilians and their dispersal rule out the
kind of rescue mission Carter attempted in the spring of 1980, a
helicopter raid that was supposed to free 53 Americans held at the
U.S. embassy in Tehran, but never got there.
   There are more than 3,000 Americans in Kuwait, about 530 in
Iraq, among some 21,000 westerners.
   So long as the Iraqi hostage crisis remains a crisis, President
Bush is likely to hold his broad public support for the way he's
handling it. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted
Saturday and Sunday put approval at 72 percent.
   But that public backing can erode when today's crisis drags into
tomorrow's long, tormenting standoff.
   And the taking of hostages is a formula for stalemate.
   So it has been in the case of the six Americans still held
hostage by Moslem radicals in Beirut. So it was when the embassy
hostages were taken captive in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979.
   ``President Carter has had a four-month ride on the crest of
public support for whatever he did dealing with the Iranian hostage
crisis,'' candidate Bush said in 1980. ``That period ... is now
coming to an end.''
   In the broader Persian Gulf crisis, Bush could face the same
problem.
   When Carter tried to get action at the United Nations, Bush
noted at the time, it proved impotent. But East-West contention has
eased, the Cold War era is over, and the Bush administration is
working throughh@e|asures to enforce the embargo while seeking
international backing.
   Bush said there are hard choices ahead, and the situation could
get tougher.
   Campaigning as Reagan's vice presidential nominee in 1980, Bush
said the Tehran embassy hostages were still in captivity that fall
because of Carter's failed foreign policy. He did not try to spell
out a way out. ``I have no specific answer, nor am I empowered to
come up with one,'' he said that fall.
   He is now.

   Gary Franks is just the type of person
you would expect to run for Congress: high school basketball star,
Yale graduate, real estate developer and city alderman.
   But he's also black and a Republican _ a combination that hasn't
been seen in the House for more than half a century.
   Franks is one of three black Republicans trying to break the
jinx this year. The others are former Cincinnati Councilman J.
Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio's open 1st District, and Louisville
businessman Al Brown, who is challenging Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli in
Kentucky's 3rd District.
   ``Basically, the whole Republican philosophy is self-help,''
said Franks, 37. It worked for his family, he said, and is far
preferable to dependence on welfare or other government programs.
   Franks is the youngest son of a mill worker who moved from North
Carolina to work in Waterbury's brass factories. His mother is a
lifelong Republican and he speaks often of his family when he
explains how he came to his views on self-sufficiency.
   ``My father came here about 55 years ago from North Carolina,''
Franks said. ``He had a sixth-grade education _ barely could read,
barely could write. And my parents raised six children. I have
three sisters who hold doctorate degrees today.''
   The last black Republican in the House was Oscar de Priest of
Chicago, who was elected in the Hoover landslide of 1928 and served
three terms.
   The predominantly working class district Franks hopes to
represent is only 4 percent black, and he is up against a
well-known Democrat _ former congressman and TV anchor Toby Moffett.
   But no one is discounting the three-term alderman, who has won
respect from Democrats and Republicans alike during his tenure.
   Of the three black Republicans running for Congress this year,
Franks is the only one seeking a seat that has been held by a
Republican during the 1980s. The incumbent, GOP Rep. John Rowland,
is running for governor.
   Rowland's coattails are expected to help Franks, as is Franks'
strong base in Waterbury and an infusion of support from the
national party.
   Voters in Connecticut's 5th district, a mixture of small towns,
suburbs and old industrial cities, couldn't have a clearer choice.
   Franks is a fiscal conservative who preaches the virtues of the
work ethic and the evils of a federal tax increase. He favors a
constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning and supports a woman's
right to choose an abortion.
   ``I believe in less government,'' he said recently. ``I believe
that we don't have to tax and spend constantly to maintain our
society.''
   Moffett, 46, went to Congress as a Nader's Raider with the
Watergate class of 1974 and served four terms before two
unsuccessful bids for statewide office _ U.S. Senate in 1982 and
governor in 1986.
   Moffett took a job as a television anchorman in Hartford after
his 1986 defeat. When he moved into the 5th District to run for
Rowland's seat, he immediately became the front-runner despite
being labeled a carpetbagger by opponents within and outside the
party.
   ``When I see Mr. Moffett, I think of the '70s,'' said Franks.
``You think of Jimmy Carter. You think of interest rates at 21{
percent. You think of an unemployment rate of over 7 percent.''
   Jay Marlin, Moffett's campaign manager, turns the tables by
tying Franks and his fiscal ideas to the Reagan economic record.
   ``If he wants to take credit for the Reagan years, he can take
credit for a tax cut for the wealthy that hurt the middle class,
for the greatest deficits in history, and for the savings and loan
crisis,'' Marlin said.
   That Franks even won the GOP nomination is considered a small
miracle in Waterbury. He needed nine ballots at the party's
convention last month to get its endorsement. On the first six
ballots, he finished dead last.
   But Republican strategists say Franks has a good chance of
beating the better-known Moffett in a district where there are
roughly 97,000 registered Democrats, 83,000 Republicans and 107,000
unaffiliated voters.
   ``From a purely political point of view, he's from the right
place _ Waterbury,'' said John Mastropietro, who is managing
Rowland's campaign for governor. ``It's extraordinarily difficult
for a Democrat to win the district without winning Waterbury.''

<HEAD>Ferris Bueller's Off-Night on NBC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As part of NBC's pre-season ``double pump'' of
six new series, ``Ferris Bueller,'' a high-school sitcom destined
for Mondays, gets its first pump tonight.
   Let us all stand now and say ``Like, wow.''
   True, the newcomer may be overshadowed by tonight's real drama _
how a rerun of Fox's ``The Simpsons'' fares in the show's new
Thursday slot against out-takes and highlights from NBC's reigning
champ, ``The Cosby Show.''
   But ``Ferris,'' based on ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' the 1986
movie that starred Matthew Broderick, probably will do well in the
Nielsens tonight because it's appearing right after Cosby's special.
   A dramatization of the phone book would get high ratings there.
   But NBC might be better off with the phone book, perhaps
starting with the name Mahatma Kane Jeeves.
   This ``Ferris,'' about a high-school junior who uses charm and
wit to glide through life, is a case of no-show.
   It stars Charlie Schlatter, who vaguely resembles a younger
Emilio Estevez. Like George Burns when he had a series, and Gary
Shandling during his, NBC's Ferris talks to the audience before and
after his scenes.
   Well, NBC is trying to avoid the traditional.
   NBC's Ferris starts tonight's preview-debut by acknowledging the
movie that gave birth to this series. ``Matthew Broderick as me?''
he asks with a sly grin, holding up a life-size carboard poster of
the star.
   ``No way. He's too white-bread, too two-dimensional.''
   Armed with a chainsaw, he saws off the poster's head and half of
one shoulder, having sardonically noted, `This is television. This
is real.''
   Well, that sure is a knee-slapper, as are his introductions of
his older sister (Jennifer Aniston), his parents (Cristine Rose and
Sam Freed) and his hypochondriac best friend (Brandon Douglas).
   Ferris is given to sayings like, ``My life consists of two
states of consciousness _ un and sub.''
   But Mom gets off a snappy line now and then, as when she tells
her daughter, ``A little less makeup, Jeannie. You're going to
school, not the mall.''
   You may be surprised to learn this show is set in Southern
California.
   Naturally, he and his sister attend a high school near the
beach. This is so Ferris can cut class to go to the beach and maybe
audition for ``Baywatch'' or something.
   The school, of course, has a mean principal (Richard Riehle). He
is so dim he grimaces whenever Ferris outwits him. But this is
because NBC is trying to avoid the traditional.
   Viewers who stay beyond the first monologue will find tonight's
show revolves around the first day of school and a beautiful
transfer student (Ami Dolenz) for whom Ferris goes bonkers in his
sophisticated teen way.
   They also will find he's one of those kids who is . . . ahead.
   He can computer-hack false attendance records, provide teacher
parking passes to students, change the school lunch menu, swing a
stretch limo, or even send the principal through a trap door with
just the touch of a button.
   And by neddies, he's also glib. But he's not the only one who's
fast upstairs. When the principal tells his sister she's late and
snarls, ``Know that that means?,'' she fires right back with this:
   ``Yeah. I won't go to heaven.''
   All things considered, this show is the Malibu version of
situation comedy _ surf's up, wit's down.
   __
   Elsewhere in television...
   CBS ANNOUNCES...START DATES: CBS has come right out and said
when its new Monday comedy roster will premiere _ on Sept. 17, the
start of the new season, that's when. In addition to the returning
``Major Dad,'' `Murphy Brown'' and ``Designing Women,'' the new
``Uncle Buck'' and ``The Trials of Rosie O'Neill'' will materialize
then.
   But the Fox folks, like NBC, are doing a little pre-season
premiering. Fox will have a Labor Day weekend lineup that includes
a Sunday preview of the interracial romantic sitcom, ``True
Colors,'' and another high school sitcom, ``Parker Lewis Can't
Lose.'' On Sept. 7, Fox will bring on the new ``D.E.A.'' series

   His body is crippled and his voice a whisper,
but Sanford Meisner goes on.
   Meisner turns 85 on Friday (Aug. 31), less than a week after
public television's ``American Masters'' profiles the man regarded
as one of the country's best acting teachers.
   ``The only time I'm enjoying myself is when I'm teaching,'' he
says. And that enjoyment has lasted more than 50 years.
   For some five decades, Meisner has taught acting at the
Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. Not as well known as Lee
Strasberg, Uta Hagen or Stella Adler, he has been called ``the
theater's best-kept secret.''
   But not to his pupils. The list of devoted Meisner disciples is
impressive: Joanne Woodward, Robert Duvall, Gregory Peck, Tony
Randall, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Peter Falk, Gwen Verdon and
more.
   ``What he wanted from you was truthful acting,'' Peck recalls in
the television tribute. ``And the proof of that is the number of
people that have come out of there . . . who set standards of
acting themselves and changed a great deal about American acting.''
   Today, physical ailments have slowed but not stopped Meisner. An
auto accident in 1984 smashed his left leg and hip. Cancer of the
larynx robbed him of his voice more than 10 years ago, but he
learned to speak again by inhaling air into his esophagus and
forcing out sounds.
   Still, Meisner loves to talk about acting, dissecting what it is
and isn't.
   ``I have a definition which I use,'' Meisner said the other day
during an interview. ``Acting is the ability to live truthfully
under imaginary circumstances.''
   The ability to learn lines is not enough, he said. ``Actors have
to make the text come to life.
   ``Only the actor knows how to find the truth inside himself and
out of which comes the reality of the text. My job is to help with
exercises which permit what's going on inside to come to the
surface.''
   Meisner teaches in New York, Los Angeles and on the Caribbean
island of Bequia where he has a home. Each summer he holds two,
four-week sessions in Bequia for 25 older, more professional
students. If they make it through these workshops, the students go
to California for a two-year course that begins in November and
ends in May.
   He has little use for rules about acting and scoffs at
intellectual theorizing about the craft.
   ``Acting is doing, and meaningful acting is doing under
emotional circumstances,'' he says.
   In New York, Meisner heads the acting department at the
Neighborhood Playhouse. He gets all the new students, usually
between 75 and 100, in September. Each day, these green recruits
have to go through a series of exercises, mostly dealing with the
development of spontaneity and concentration. Later, there are
classes on character development. In November, he turns them over
to teachers he has trained himself.
   When Meisner teaches, he uses a microphone to amplify his raspy,
often indistinct voice. But his opinions are as clear and sharp as
ever.
   ``Today's students are somewhat vulgar,'' he said. ``Maybe it's
television. They don't have much grounding in the theater, and what
they do know is superficial. Everyone just wants to make money and
that's in television.''
   Meisner was born in Brooklyn. The son of Hungarian immigrants,
he was groomed to become a furrier like his father. But he
discovered the theater at age 19 and didn't look back. Instead, he
became an actor.
   Meisner was one of the founding members of the influential Group
Theater led by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford
and which was a major force on Broadway in the 1930s. He appeared
in some of the company's biggest hits including ``Men in White,''
``Awake and Sing'' and ``Golden Boy.''
   Meisner began teaching at the Neighborhood Playhouse while a
member of the Group Theater. The company folded in 1941 but Meisner
kept teaching at the playhouse, and only occasionally made
appearances on stage. His screen appearances are also rare. He's
best known for his work in the films ``The Story on Page One'' and
``Tender Is the Night.''
   But he urges his pupils to do all kinds of work, especially
plays if they want to improve at their craft.
   ``Acting is fun,'' he says on the television show. ``Don't let
that get around.''

   For songwriter Oliver Leiber,
something as simple as the title to a cheap novel can inspire a hit
single.
   Stuck once when his car broke down, Leiber killed time at a
secondhand bookstore flipping through the covers of ``horrible,
cheesy, drugstore romance novels.'' Then a title grabbed him:
``Opposites Attract.''
   That was enough to give him the gist of a funky song that
eventually became a No. 1 smash for singer Paula Abdul.
   ``I look at a title as the complete picture, in a way. This is
what I'm building up to. This is the big payoff,'' said Leiber, who
also wrote and produced Abdul's hits ``(It's Just) the Way That You
Love Me'' and ``Forever Your Girl.''
   ``So if this title is the payoff, how did I get there and what
is going to make that feel like a payoff?''
   Titles are not the only things that come to Leiber by accident.
   The son of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame lyricist Jerry Leiber, he
originally wanted to be a session drummer in New York City. But
after coming to Minnesota in 1983 for chemical dependency
treatment, he stayed to play drums and guitar for local bands.
   ``If you had told me that I would go to Minneapolis, Minnesota,
and that's where I would make it in music, that would have been the
most ludicrous idea to me,'' said Leiber, who grew up in Manhattan.
   These days, though, he's not entirely comfortable with his
thoughts of living part of the year in Los Angeles. ``I associate
so much of my success and the good stuff that's happened with being
here,'' he said. ``I get scared that somehow I'm going to lose
whatever it was.''
   In some senses the 29-year-old Leiber is following the lead of
his father, who with composer Mike Stoller wrote such 1950s
classics as ``Jailhouse Rock'' and ``Kansas City.''
   ``I don't think I would have been a writer or a musician if I
wasn't his son,'' he said. ``I think I went into that for that
reason.''
   But the younger Leiber, whose hoop earrings and reddish
dreadlocks give him a bohemian look, never had ``lengthy walks on
the beach'' with his father to discuss the art of songwriting.
   ``There was no sitting on his lap and `this is how you do it,
son.' None of that,'' he said.
   While his father was from the old school of songwriting
(``yellow manila pad, bottle of Hennessy, three packs of Camel
Straights late at night''), Oliver Leiber has a more modern
approach.
   After recording an instrumental track in the basement studio of
his suburban home, Leiber will pop the tape into his car stereo,
cruise around and sing along into a microcassette recorder.
   ``There's something about motion for me, and not being stagnant
and sitting and not being at home and not having the phone ring or
the dog wanting to play, that creates a certain freedom,'' he said.
   Leiber worked with his father and brother, Jed, on ``L.A.
L.A.,'' a song heard in the 1985 movie ``To Live and Die in L.A.''
Three years later, ``Obsessed,'' the first record Leiber wrote and
produced by himself, was featured in the movie ``Bright Lights, Big
City.''
   He then collaborated with Twin Cities singer St. Paul on the
single ``Rich Man.'' Abdul was choreographing the video for ``Rich
Man'' in Los Angeles when she heard a tape of ``(It's Just) the Way
That You Love Me'' and ``flipped over the tune,'' according to
Leiber.
   Dan Brennan, Leiber's manager at the time, got that song and two
others _ ``Forever Your Girl'' (inspired by Leiber's ex-girlfriend
from Fargo, N.D., and originally titled ``Small Town Girl'') and
``Opposites Attract'' _ placed on Abdul's 1988 debut album. Leiber
produced all three songs, which became hit singles. Abdul calls
Leiber ``My hero!'' in her album's liner notes.
   Leiber seeks inspiration from hooks _ short, catchy phrases. A
title can come from something overheard in the studio or from a
dictionary of cliches he consults. He likens songwriting to a
reverse process of connect-the-dots.
   ``I sort of have the picture and I backtrack and I go, `How did
I get here? What are the steps that are going to make this thing
work?' '' he said.
   Simplicity is the key to a good pop song, Leiber said. ``If you
really can't say it in a sentence, you've got too much going on.''
   A big fan of his father's songs, Leiber remembers what his
father told him about success. ``He used to say to me, `When you're
it, you're just it.' The minute you start thinking, `What was it I
did? How can I be it?' the moment has already passed.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You're watching an interesting documentary on
pollution of a Kentucky river, switch channels and come back a few
minutes later to find a yuppie rap video on the same station.
   Don't worry. There's nothing wrong with your set _ it's just Tom
Weinberg testing the limits of television.
   Weinberg is executive producer of ``The 90s,'' an hour-long
showcase of independent videotape makers and producers that zips
through topics such as politics, religion, the environment and
culture at a pace designed to dazzle _ but never bore _ its viewers.
   The weekly collage, now in its second run of 13 shows, is sent
to more than 90 public and cable television stations across the
country. Many of them run it between 10 p.m. and midnight.
   The time slots don't seem to bother Weinberg and his cohorts,
who are having fun with their latest attempt to alter the message
and the medium.
   ``Part of it is we want to change the world in ways that make it
more fun, more humane, more responsive,'' says Weinberg, 46, who
has a 1960s social conscience and a 1990s love for technology.
   ``Part of it is that it's an incredibly absorbing pastime _ the
process of making TV.''
   The television they're making is not like standard commercial
television or the other avant-garde shows on public stations. The
advent of a new generation of inexpensive but sophisticated video
cameras has enabled TV-quality production of unconventional,
low-budget pieces and even amateur contributions.
   One program includes Panamanians speaking out about the U.S.
invasion of their country, a look at the destruction of Brazilian
rain forests and a segment on residents of a Chicago public housing
project.
   Another includes a report on pro-choice and anti-abortion forces
demonstrating outside a Los Angeles abortion clinic, a father's
conversation with his cerebral palsy-stricken daughter, a wacky
piece on three women who call themselves the ``Advice Ladies'' and
offer their wisdom free on the streets of New York City and a
caustic look at Pat Boone and a minister reminiscing about Boone's
``miracle'' rescue from a bad investment.
   Segments can run from 10 seconds to 10 minutes. The material is
cut, spliced and interposed with graphics at the whim of the
producers.
   ``It's very different, rougher,'' says Kevin Harris, program
director for public television stations WGBH and WGBX in Boston.
``The subject matter is really all over the place.''
   Weinberg says viewers are supposed to enjoy the show at whatever
level they can understand and appreciate.
   ``There's a lot of nuance, and you interpret it differently than
I do,'' he says.
   He and his small staff produce ``The 90s'' in a small, downtown
office filled with overnight delivery envelopes and stacks of
videotapes. They sift through 30 to 40 tapes a week.
   The works come from many sources: independent producers looking
for an outlet for their work, unsolicited contributions and
correspondents under contract to produce segments for the program.
   The finished product is presented to the public television
system by sponsoring station KBDI in Denver, the home of Weinberg
colleague John Schwartz, whose screen credit is ``chief
bureaucrat.'' It also is fed via satellite to cable stations.
   The first 13 episodes were fed in November through January, with
a commitment to be run on 25 PBS stations. A $350,000 grant from a
Corporation for Public Broadcasting-Public Broadcasting Service
fund will ensure a third season with at least 13 new shows and a
broader PBS audience, Weinberg says.
   Grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
helped the show get started.
   Weinberg, a Chicago native with a penchant for cigars, greasy
cheeseburgers and the Chicago White Sox, got an MBA from New York
University in the late '60s and worked at the family bakery before
getting involved in video in the early '70s.
   He helped found TVTV, a group of filmmakers and producers who
made their mark with a pair of video documentaries about the 1972
Democratic and Republican national conventions that gained critical
notice.
   Later he helped found the Center for New Television, a
not-for-profit haven in Chicago that provides resources for video
producers.
   Weinberg also created ``Image Union,'' a locally produced,
award-winning PBS program featuring short works by independent
filmmakers and producers.
   Weinberg might be doing something that no one else is, but he
might not be able to reach mass audiences.
   ``There is so little invention and so much convention in
television,'' says J. Fred McDonald, curator of the Museum of
Broadcast Communication in Chicago. ``There is not much room for
artistry in an inventive sort of way.''
   Harris says ``The 90s'' will never capture a large audience,
even on public television.
   ``If it really was broad enough to get a lot of exposure, it
wouldn't be the kind of show it is,'' he said.
   But others believe Weinberg may yet win the influence he wants,
and just might influence what people are doing on television.

<HEAD>New Book Suggests USS Indianapolis Captain Wrongly Tried</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE ELLIOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the
subsequent court-martial of its captain constitute the U.S. Navy's
worst moral disaster as well its worst sea disaster, said the
author of a new book on the affair.
   Journalist Dan Kurzman, author of ``Fatal Voyage,'' contends
Capt. Charles McVay was made a scapegoat to mask mismanagement by
high Navy officials in the tragedy that claimed 880 lives in the
closing days of World War II.
   A Japanese submarine torpedoed the unescorted cruiser in the
western Pacific Ocean on July 30, 1945, after the ship had
delivered components for the Hiroshima atomic bomb to Tinian Island
in the Northern Marianas.
   For five days, survivors clung to a few life rafts or bobbed in
life jackets as dehydration, exposure and swarming sharks killed
hundreds of their companions. Military officials did not know the
ship had gone down, and the survivors were found by chance.
   McVay, a highly decorated admiral's son, became the first
captain ever tried by the U.S. Navy for losing a ship in battle.
   In a highly publicized court-martial, he was found guilty of
gross negligence for failing to maintain his ship on a ``zigzag,''
or antisubmarine, course, even though McVay's orders did not
require him to zigzag.
   ``I think he was railroaded. There's no other word for it. They
simply wanted to protect their own necks,'' Kurzman said in a
telephone interview from New Jersey.
   Forty-five years later, McVay's family is still fighting to
clear his name. Kurzman hopes his book will help them.
   Kurzman conducted more than 100 interviews and reviewed
thousands of Navy documents to write his tale of McVay and the
horrifying days his men spent in the ocean between Guam and the
Philippines. The torpedo hits sank the Indianapolis within 15
minutes and about 800 of the ship's 1,196 crewmen were able to
abandon ship. The cruiser sent an SOS, but its radio apparently had
been knocked out.
   The men initially were confident of rescue, but watched in
frustration as planes passed high overhead without spotting them.
For the most part, they were without food or fresh water.
   Delirium set in after a day, and some men began attacking other
survivors. Others died in agony after drinking sea water. Some,
believing there was a spigot with fresh water several feet down,
tore off life jackets and dove down, never to resurface. Still
others swam toward imaginary islands or dove to underwater hotels.
   At night, sharks would swim off with dozens of the men, leaving
only bloody streaks on the oily water.
   No one thought to check for the Indianapolis when it failed to
arrive at Leyte, and no high-level Navy officer was disciplined for
failing to respond.
   Survivors might never have been found had not a plane on an
anti-submarine patrol spotted an oil streak left by the sunken
ship. Only 316 men survived the ordeal.
   Kurzman said Navy officials, desperate for a scapegoat, quickly
fixed blame on McVay, son of former U.S. Asiatic Fleet commander
Adm. Charles McVay II.
   Against the recommendation of Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander in
chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, who said McVay's ``failure to
order a zigzag course was an error in judgment, but not of such
nature as to constitute gross negligence,'' Secretary of the Navy
James Forrestal ordered that McVay be court-martialed.
   Kurzman said his book contains new information proving that
McVay was wrongly tried. He uncovered a Navy document that admits
the charge of failing to zigzag probably had nothing to do with the
loss of the ship. One memo characterized the charge as
``supertechnical.''
   Testimony by the Japanese sub commander, flown in from Japan by
the prosecution, and an expert witness for the defense suggested
that zigzagging probably would not have saved the Indianapolis.
   The Navy had information that four Japanese submarines were
operating between Guam and the Philippines _ one had sunk the
destroyer USS Underhill six days earlier, Kurzman said. That
information could have alerted McVay to be more cautious, but it
never reached the captain or the routing officers on Guam who sent
the Indianapolis out unescorted.
   The information was kept under wraps for security reasons,
Kurzman said.
   Kurzman said information that might have cleared McVay was
edited out of public documents and the Navy has refused to release
it.
   Found by the Navy to be unfit to ever command a vessel again,
McVay was assigned to a shore job in New Orleans. He was
transferred to the retired list in 1949 with the rank of rear
admiral because of earlier combat citations, but he never escaped
the ghosts of the Indianapolis. He was haunted by letters and
telephone calls from dead crewmen's relatives who blamed him for
their loved ones deaths.
   ``My father hated to open his mail on any given holiday,'' said
his son, Kimo Wilder McVay, a promoter in Honolulu. ``Usually these
cards said something like, `If it weren't for you, my son, brother,
etc., would be with us this Easter, Christmas, Father's Day, etc.'''
   The elder McVay, plagued by a number of personal problems, shot
himself in the head with his service revolver in the front yard of
his Litchfield, Conn., home in 1968.
   A White House assistant told Kimo McVay in 1983 that no
authority exists for the Secretary of the Navy to change the
findings of the court-martial and said presidential pardons are not
awarded posthumously.
   ``Their argument is there's no precedent, but there's no
precedent to the fact that he's the only U.S. captain
court-martialed for losing a ship in battle. That isn't
democracy,'' Kurzman said. ``If there's no machinery, then create
it.''

   Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos has instructed
priests at worship services this Sunday to read an encyclical from
the Ecumenical Patriarch urging protection of the natural
environment.
   ``Unfortunately mankind in our day under the influence of an
extreme rationalism and hedonism has lost the sense of the sanctity
of the created world,'' says Patriarch Dimitrios I of
Constantinople.
   The teaching letter says, ``This violation of nature's laws is
not for the fulfillment of basic human needs, but aims at
satisfying increasing appetites and desires, encouraged by the
dominant philosophy of a consumer society.''
   Dimitrios, considered ``first among equals'' among leaders of
worldwide Eastern Orthodoxy, says the result of continued abuse of
``nature's gifts'' will be ``ultimate self-destruction for
humanity.''
   Setting Sept. 1 as a special day for prayers for the
``deliverance of creation'' from ``harm inflicted by human hands,''
the letter urges protection of ``the natural world which God
created in all its its beauty.''

   East European Baptist church leaders
have appealed for overseas help in responding to a ``spiritual
hunger'' awakened by recent political changes in their countries.
   ``The door is open for evangelism,'' said Soviet Baptist Union
leader Gregory Komendant, who led a 156-member Soviet delegation to
the 16th Baptist World Congress in Seoul.
   Komendant said the political changes initiated by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev have created ``an unbelievable
spiritual hunger.'' But he said evangelism will not be easy in the
Soviet Union, mainly because of a lack of books, facilities and
funds.
   Komendant and other church leaders from East European nations
said religious freedom and civil rights have greatly improved in
their countries, with Western evangelists now allowed to come
freely.
   The six-day Seoul congress drew about 10,000 Baptist church
leaders, including 200 delegates from East Europe. It was sponsored
by the U.S.-based Baptist World Alliance, which claims 36 million
followers in 145 countries.

<HEAD>Churches, Often Critical Of U.S Interventions, Back Mideast Stand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious forces, often critical of U.S. military expeditions,
have indicated general support for America's intervention in the
present Middle East crisis.
   They see the situation as different in this case, although they,
like most others in and out of government, hope for a non-violent
solution.
   Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Jewish
representatives have backed in principle President Bush's stand
against Iraq's invasion of Kurwait, including steps to resist it.
   The National Council of Churches, including most major
Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations, denounced the
``unjustifiable act of aggression by Iraq against Kuwait,'' adding:
   ``The Council supports the demands of the international
community for a speedy and complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces.''
   Those demands have included United Nations sanctions against
Iraq, and sending of multi-national forces, including those of the
U.S., to prevent an Iraqi military drive into Saudi Arabia.
   Although the council and many religious leaders have strongly
criticized some past U.S. military initiatives, such as in Panama,
Granada and military aid in Central America, that hasn't happened
this time.
   ``One reason there hasn't been that kind of criticism is that
the taking of Kuwait was so wrong _ going into that little country
and gobbling it up,'' said Carol Birkland, head of the inter-church
council's Middle East committee.
   Ms. Birkland of Chicago, also secretary for the Middle East of
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, said the churches
sometimes are accused of ``knee-jerk, anti-government'' criticism
of U.S. foreign interventions.
   But that's not true, she said, as the reaction this time
demonstrates. ``We look at each situation on a case-by-case
basis,'' she added, and in this instance, ``we've been generally
supportive'' of the U.S. stance.
   ``The situation is different,'' she said. She added that with
the end of the East-West Cold War and humanity's immense relief at
Soviet-American cooperation, ``we thought we had moved beyond this
kind of thing.
   ``But there still is the old pattern. We can only hope and pray
there will be no further violence.''
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the Iraqi invasion
was ``devoid of provocation or any justification.''
   It ``poses a severe threat to international peace,'' he said,
noting that the international community has responded ``through the
use of multiple sanctions against Iraq.''
   Although not commenting on particular U.S. tactics, as was the
case with the inter-church council, the official Catholic statement
asked prayers ``for the members of the armed forces and their
families.''
   It also urged prayers for ``continued international cooperation
to protect both human rights and peace.''
   The American Jewish Committee commended President Bush for ``the
forceful leadership you have demonstrated'' in the crisis, urged a
``firm and collective response to the naked act of aggression
perpetrated by Iraq'' and added:
   ``American determination to resist Saddam Hussein's bid for
power sends a powerful signal to the world that ruthless tyrants
... cannot violate international law with impunity, nor attempt too
hold the world's oil supply hostage to their will.''
   The Rev. Emilio Castro, general secretary of the World Council
of Churches, said in a statement in Geneva the council ``opposes
strongly'' Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and supports the U.N.'s ``firm
stand and action'' about it.
   Urging the Arab League to ``go further'' in mediating the
conflict, Castro said, ``We call on all nations concerned to
exercise patience and good will by refraining from use of force or
show of force.''
   The Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, a Roman Catholic specialist on
international affairs of Georgetown University, commended the U.N.
call for sanctions, and said deployment of U.S. and other troops
could be regarded a means of preserving peace rather than
aggravating hositlities.
   ``You can argue that the movement of forces is designed to be a
deterrent to further aggression,'' he told Catholic News Service.
``In that sense, I think that's wise.''
   Robert T. Hennemeyer, director for justice and peace of the U.S.
Catholic Conference in Washington, said U.S. church officials
``regard this as a clear case of aggression that thereby would meet
the just war criteria.''
   By that criteria, he noted, ``a nation is justified in helping a
friend attacked unjustly.''
   Evangelist Billy Graham, endorsing Bush's call for prayer, said
the Persian Gulf situation is ``potentially one of the most
dangerous threats to world peace and stability since World War II.''
   ``Upheavals there also could have major spiritual
implications,'' he said. ``These events are happening in that part
of the world where history began, and, the Bible says, where
history as we know it will some day end.''
   ``Let us pray that God will give wisdom to all those leaders
whose decisions can make a difference there...'' he said ``Let us
pray also that God will intervene and bring peace to that troubled
region.''

   The small-is-beautiful fraternity of
ale fanatics had a bitter surprise at the Great British Beer
Festival.
   The grand champion, Burton Ale, was made by one of the six giant
breweries that are the betes noires of the British beer snob.
   Michael Jackson, an Englishman who calls himself the world's
best-known beer writer, declared that Burton Ale ``really is a very
serious English bitter, a classic example of an English bitter.''
   He rhapsodized about the ``beautiful balance of the sweetness of
the malt, and the flowery, floral character, the drier
characteristics, of the hop. I think in the end the hop wins
through.''
   Definitely an exception, in the eyes of the Campaign for Real
Ale, the festival sponsor.
   ``On the whole, we don't think that the national brewers do a
particularly good job,'' said Stephen Cox, spokesman for the
organization.
   ``That doesn't mean that we don't give praise where it's due,
and Burton Ale is actually an example of a national brewer doing
something that we think is right.''
   Another big brewer, Whitbread, was banned from the festival as
punishment for closing two old breweries ormer FBI agent's third espionage
trial. AM-FBI Spy.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In his years of helping care for the homeless,
the Rev. Joe Carroll has decided it's a problem that can never be
solved. Poverty has always been with us, he says, and will never be
eradicated. But thanks to his efforts in the slums of San Diego,
hundreds of homeless men and women have a chance to rejoin
society's mainstream, if they choose to.

   In the color of sandy adobe, it looks more like
a school than a home. It is, in a way, a school for life.
   The Rev. Joe Carroll, who grew up in a two-bedroom Bronx
tenement with his parents and eight brothers and sisters, thought
he knew all there was to know about poverty when he built this home
for the homeless less than five years ago.
   But in the interim the good-humored Roman Catholic priest with
painfully arthritic knees says he has learned as much from the
homeless as he has taught them about adjusting to society.
   Gone is his old notion that homelessness or other ills such as
drug abuse can be wiped out.
   Homelessness is a problem that has been around forever, he says.
Problems can't always be solved, but they can be managed.
   So Father Joe, as he is known in this slum neighborhood on the
edge of downtown San Diego, is working in his pragmatic way not to
eradicate homelessness, just to manage it.
   Our society can't tolerate the idea that some Americans live
poor, he says. ``But we're going to have to come to the realization
that there's an element of every society at the bottom. Yet I keep
hearing that homelessness and homeless kids are a recent
phenomenon. Never had that in the United States before.
   ``Well how did Father Flanagan's Boys Town get started? He must
have found runaway kids somewhere...What did Charles Dickens write
about? Exactly what we've got today. We've always had people living
on the streets, in the sewers, the bridges; kids taken advantage of
by criminals, using drugs. What has changed since Dickens' time?''
   Carroll used to believe, like others, that jobs were the answer.
That, he says, he no longer beieves. Some 60 percent can't work,
most because they are illiterate.
   Carroll's revised methods are built around what the homeless see
as important, and his knowledge of what unrelenting frustration can
do to the human soul.
   Stage One is for the people who come in from the street. It's a
crash pad for the night, a flophouse, a dormitory with a place to
shower and get your laundry done, a warm, clean bed.
   Residents sign in every day for seven days for a bed. Then they
sign up weekly for a bed. Once they pass 30 days the bed is theirs
until they miss seven days in a row without telling the center.
   Carroll says there is no attempt to change behavior patterns,
but a bed unused is a bed denied someone else. ``You go out on a
binge and crash a couple of nights in the park, but you know you're
going to have a bed to come back to.''
   In Stage One residents can earn their way to semi-privacy, then
privacy, by being a good tenant. They can move to double-occupancy
cubicles in another large dormitory. This entails additional
responsibility, keeping the place clean and doing laundry for
newcomers. It can all lead to a job and a room of one's own.
   ``All the way through you can see the goals, they're within
reach, you can taste it, you can see the other guys being more
successful,'' Carroll says. ``Some guys may never, ever, move out
of Stage One. Some, for whatever reason, can't change their basic
mentality. But God bless them, they're still welcome.''
   About twice a year the street people get new clothes donated by
big retailers.
   Adjacent to the shelter for street people is the St. Vincent de
Paul-Joan Kroc Center for homeless families.
   At the center residents are offered job training, schooling in
the English language, assistance in getting welfare or veterans'
benefits, legal services, advice on housing, beauty care and how
best to use food coupons in the newspaper.
   For many of the children, it is the first time they have had an
opportunity to go to school, the first time they have seen a
doctor. Three small rooms are a multigrade school at present, but
new quarters are under construction.
   It has been something over a half dozen years since Father Joe's
bishop, looking at the meager efforts to help the homeless, told
him to get things off the ground. Since then, Carroll, now a
monsignor, has collected millions of dollars in donations. What
started as a thrift shop and soup and sandwiches at the back door
has grown into a small village of hope.
   The current well-equipped but tiny clinic soon will move into a
10,000-square-foot space in a new building. There is one staff
physician but 70 others who volunteer, one staff surgeon backed up
by 34 volunteers.
   One of the medical volunteers bought $30,000 worth of clinic
equipment with his own money. Volunteer dentists are buying the
equipment they need to operate in the new clinic.
   A veterinarian comes in once a month to give shots and care for
residents' pets.
   Almost every part of the shelter serves double duty. The dining
room is a basketball court at night. When there is an overload, it
is covered with cots. Whenever the temperature goes down to 40
degrees, the shelter is open all night. On those nights regular
capacity of 450 beds can be increased by an additional 350.
   The kitchen also supplies the soup kitchen where Carroll began
his operation, less than a mile away. It prepares 2,800 to 3,000
meals a day.
   Six days a week it is manned by volunteers from the Catholic
Workers Movement; on Sunday by volunteers from Temple Beth Israel.
   The alumni of the center are spreading through the city of San
Diego. When Carroll turned his car over to the valet for parking at
Symphony Towers, the valet was a graduate. He said that without the
center's help ``I couldn't have been able to turn my life around.''
   Now he is sharing an apartment and going to college.

<HEAD>Porsche 911: Power, Tradition in This Sports Car Package</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It's difficult to test a Porsche 911 without feeling sentimental.
   This is the car that retained its fluid, round-nosed shape from
the 1960s while the others in the auto world tinkered first with
box-like designs, then aerodynamic forms.
   This is the car that retained its big, round headlights, rear,
air-cooled, six-cylinder engine and little dashboard gauges while
others added pop-up headlights, digital speedometers and overhauled
their engines.
   This is a car that still turns heads and brings out the racer in
people. Pull up to a stoplight and watch the driver in the next
lane give you a glance and rev his Mazda engine. Deep down, he
knows he won't beat the Porsche's 0-60, 5.5-second performance, but
he wants to try anyway.
   The Carrera 2 Tiptronic that I drove included new features as
well as the old, revered ones. There are now airbags for both the
driver and front seat passenger. Anti-lock brakes are standard. So
is power-assist steering.
   But perhaps the most intriguing new feature for 1990 was the
Dual Function Tiptronic transmission, which offers urban drivers
the option of automatic shifting or clutchless manual shifting.
   The driver simply puts the gearshifter on either the automatic
or manual side of the gearbox after shifting out of ``Park'' or
``Neutral.'' In automatic, the car behaves as if it has an
automatic transmission; it shifts itself.
   On the manual side, the car waits for the driver to move through
the four gears. Just push the shifter forward at appropriate times,
and a red light on the dashboard will move from one number to the
next to indicate what gear you're in. The driver downshifts by
pushing the gearshifter toward the back of the car. There's no
clutch.
   I'll admit this took some getting used to. Early on, I kept
putting my left foot down on the floor as if there was a clutch,
and I wasn't always picking the best times to shift.
   But once I got the hang of it, I found how fun this car could
be. In second gear, my head snapped back into the headrest and the
front of the car came up as I accelerated. In manual, I could
manipulate the gears to get the maximum power, and sweep up behind
another car to pass with ease.
   The 3.6-liter, six-cylinder engine was simply superb, and at 247
horsepower, the most muscular ever in a 911. Gas mileage might not
be the greatest _ at 16 miles per gallon in the city _ but you
don't get a $60,000-plus car like this and then count pennies at
the fuel pump.
   There is a back seat, if you want to call it that. But don't
expect it to carry anything more than a briefcase and some clothes.
I was so scrunched sitting back there _ even sideways, sitting
alone, I couldn't stretch out my legs, and my head was nearly in my
lap. It's best to plan on pulling the seat down and using the area
for storage space.
   And be sure to get used to riding low to the ground. The Porsche
911 set me at eye level with the bottom half of the license plate
on a Misubishi Montero in front of me. While this can be somewhat
unnerving in city traffic, the low, squat design of the 911 helps
the car really hug the road and corner beautifully.
   In the test car, the spokes on the steering wheel sometimes
blocked my view of those red, lit numbers on the dashboard that
indicated what gear I was in. I also noticed considerable noise as
the tires worked the roads, and I had to keep pushing a button to
get the rear-window wiper to keep the back window clear in a
downpour. The wiper only takes a couple swipes, then turns itself
off.
   But those mild complaints matter little to the 911's serious
fans, identified by company spokesman Hal Williams as independent,
entrepreneur types with average annual household income of
$140,000. Three-quarters of purchasers are men, average age 42.
   The 1990 model year was the first for the Tiptronic
transmission, and Porsche planned to make just 650 of the 911
Carrera 2 Tiptronics for the U.S. market. Williams said that as the
model year was winding down, nearly all Tiptronics already had
buyers.
   Now, the 1991s are beginning to arrive at Porsche's Charleston,
S.C., port. They are identical to the 1990s except that some new
colors have been added and the base price has climbed 3.8 percent,
from $61,280 for a 1990 model to $63,650 for a 1991. The new colors
include a vivid cobalt blue metallic and a super-bright coral red
metallic.
   Consumer Reports magazine does not list owner complaints on the
Porsche 911.

   The Vietnam War left Cherie Rankin a
legacy of sadness denied and tears delayed.
   As a 24-year-old Red Cross worker confronted every day by death
and suffering, she was unable to cry. ``When you're in a war,'' she
says, ``you have to turn off the feelings in order to do the work.''
   For more than a decade after she came home in September 1971,
just thinking about Vietnam produced headaches, and she'd become
sick to her stomach. At a reunion of Red Cross workers in 1984, she
threw up. Until then, she says, she had no idea how Vietnam had
affected her.
   Now, 20 years later, she is making a sentimental journey back to
help restore some of what the United States destroyed, and to shed
her tears.
   Ms. Rankin is part of a group of nine Americans paying their own
way over to help rebuild a medical clinic near Hanoi destroyed by
U.S. bombers.
   The team, which is leaving in early September, is the third to
return to build badly needed medical facilities under the auspices
of the Veterans Vietnam Restoration Project in Garberville, Calif.
During September and October, they will work with former Vietnamese
enemies who now are comrades in peace.
   Ms. Rankin, now 44, will revisit the fields where the men she
knew died and walk the grounds of the Da Nang-area orphanage where
she fed, clothed and played with the pitifully maimed children of
war.
   ``While I was there, I never felt the sadness, and I carry
around some pain for those children,'' she said. ``Being able to do
the crying on the spot would be helpful _ being near firebases
where many men who died I knew, whose faces I see in my mind, to do
some crying for them.''
   She remembers flying in helicopters to the American firebases to
boost the soldiers' morale. She is in field hospitals holding the
hands of mortally wounded GIs. They clutch her tightly. She is
their last link to life.
   The baby-face of a young GI she met in Da Nang while he was
awaiting his assignment is forever fixed in her mind. He was so new
his boots still were spit-shined. A few days later, she saw him
lying in a field hospital with tubes sticking out of him and the
right side of his face blown away.
   ``I went over to him and held his hand,'' she said. ``I reminded
him I had seen him the other day, and I think I said to him, `I'm
sorry.' He flicked his eyes. He couldn't talk. But he gripped my
hand.''
   Within minutes, he was dead. ``That was my first death
experience. I marked that as the period of time where I numbed out.
When I saw that kid there, I really wanted to run. I wanted to go
home. I wanted my mother.''
   Sometimes, she still can hear the familiar whirring sounds of
the helicopters and her mind drifts back. She now feels the fear
she repressed, and she shakes at the thought of it.
   Dreams of Vietnam invade her sleep. If she doesn't remember
them, there always are the pillows across her body to remind her.
During the war, Red Cross workers pulled mattresses over their
bodies to protect themselves during rocket attacks.
   ``I will wake up startled ... and all of my bed pillows are
lined up the length of the bed,'' she said. ``Even if I don't have
a clear memory of the dream, I'm acting as though I were
experiencing it.''
   Other images are of the children for whom she cared. They are
scorched by napalm, blinded by bombs. Their arms and legs are
missing.
   Among her poignant photos is one of an orphan, an Amerasian boy
born to a Vietnamese mother and American father. He sits forlornly.
A fly rests on his face. One of his legs is missing, blown away by
a mine.
   ``He represents Vietnam to me,'' said Ms. Rankin. ``This is the
child of the war and it says it all to me.''
   But there were rare moments of joy amid the poverty and pain. A
reminder is another photo, this one of three grinning orphan boys
throwing their arms around her. One is blind, one is missing part
of his leg and one is retarded.
   ``I love it,'' Ms. Rankin said. ``Just look at how happy I am to
see those kids and how happy they are to see me, how much physical
touch is being shared.''
   Ms. Rankin, who originally is from West Palm Beach, Fla., went
to Vietnam in September 1970, just out of Florida State University
in Tallahassee. She did not believe in the war but had faith in the
men who were fighting, like her younger brother, Doug, a Marine.
   ``I went to visit my brother,'' she said. ``Even though I had
questions about the war, I really undertstood why the guys were
there and I wanted to do what I could to help them. I also wanted
the adventure and to find out why we were there, see for myself.''
   Despite her reservations, and the sexism and sexual harassment
she sometimes encountered, she didn't question the U.S.
government's morality or motivation.
   ``I was so red, white and blue my blood was lavender,'' Ms.
Rankin said. ``I think we fell into two categories in their mind.
We were either virgins or whores, their favorite girlfriend or
sister, or we were there to be propositioned.
   ``I feel I was a pawn of our government, coercing soldiers to
fight. Red Cross women were held up as home and apple pie. `This is
what you're fighting for.' The way the military used Red Cross
women was sexist. We were there ... to be their decoration. ...
We're flying out in helicopters in dresses.''
   When she returned home a year later, the formerly gregarious
woman withdrew into herself, seeking solace in solitude. ``For many
years, I would be afraid to be in crowds. I did not like going to
social events,'' she said.
   But that has improved through counseling at a veterans center.
   ``I've had therapy off and on for 10 years,'' she said. ``I
figure it's the rest of my life, not necessarily anymore because I
have impairment for any level of functioning, but it's a matter of
growth, knowing yourself, learning about yourself. It's an ongoing
process.''

   She first went into therapy for help with some marital and
childhood issues.
   ``I had no idea Vietnam affected me until around six years
ago,'' she said.
   She and her husband divorced in 1983, partly due to the war.
   ``I closed the book on Vietnam when I got back like everybody
else did,'' she said. ``My husband had been a war protester and we
never talked about Vietnam. He was not comfortable talking about
it. Neither was anybody else in the country.''
   At the Vietnam reunion in New York City six years ago, ``the
whole thing started opening up, everything started coming to the
surface,'' she said. Just after she arrived, she got a throbbing
headache that lasted for a day and a half until she threw up.
   ``I felt better after I did that,'' she said. ``It's taken me a
long time. I would have physical responses to thinking about
Vietnam or talking about Vietnam that would last sometimes for a
couple of weeks. Now I have a little bit of an emotional response
after I talk about Vietnam.''
   Ms. Rankin herself is a psychotherapist. While in Vietnam, she
will do some construction work, but she also will serve as the team
shrink, co-leading a discussion group.
   She is one of hundreds of veterans returning in recent years to
try to sort out the real war, as well as the war in their minds.
   ``It profoundly affected your life, whether you're conscious of
it or not,'' she said. ``I think many of us who make that
pilgrimage back become conscious that it affected our lives and
there's something we haven't resolved, or haven't put to rest. I
think people go back to do that.''

   The state Casino Control Commission voted 5-0 on Tuesday to

answers for Mr. Trump or New Jersey,'' acting commission Chairwoman
Valerie Armstrong said, adding that regulators had no choice but to
approve the plan.

   No sooner did Donald Trump win some
time to restructure his troubled financial empire than the clock
began ticking for his next showdown with gambling regulators in
October.
   The Casino Control Commission voted 5-0 to approve a bailout
plan that pledges Trump's three casinos as collateral for a $65
million loan he received to make a bond payment on the Trump Castle
hotel and casino.
   But the commission decided to call Trump in early for
relicensing hearings on all three of his casinos because of
questions surrounding his finances. Trump wasn't scheduled for the
hearings until the spring, but the commission wants to see him in
October.
   ``We must hold a financial stability hearing as soon as
possible,'' said acting commission Chairwoman Valerie Armstrong.
``The Casino Control Act requires all casino enterprises to
maintain financial stability, integrity and responsibility.
   ``We have approved the pledges without inquiring into whether
the three Trump properties continue to meet these standards, and it
is surely our obligation to conduct that inquiry as quickly as we
can,'' Ms. Armstrong said.
   The October hearing comes one month before Trump must make a $47
million bond payment due Nov. 15 on the Trump Taj Mahal Casino
Resort. The state Division of Gaming Enforcement, which reluctantly
endorsed Trump's bailout, said the developer will not make that
payment under present conditions.
   ``November is just around the corner and that's the immediate
problem we face,'' said Thomas Auriemma, a deputy attorney general
with the division. ``If the money had not been advanced, the whole
Trump Organization would have faced, in our opinion, total
collapse.''
   Trump's attorneys also argued that his empire could have
crumbled without the commission's approval.
   Ms. Armstrong said the commission shared the division's lack of
enthusiasm for the plan, but would approve it as the best immediate
hope for the solvency of Trump's three casinos.
   ``This is obviously a situation in which there are no good
answers for Mr. Trump or New Jersey,'' she said. ``Whether we
approve or disapprove this restructuring, our action will be
fundamentally unsettling. . . . The risk of substantial economic
disruption at the casinos will be less with the restructuring than
it is without it.''
   Trump _ wearing a blue tie, blue suit and blue-striped shirt _
whispered occasionally during the 30-minute hearing to his top
executives, but otherwise stared straight ahead, unsmiling and with
his lips pursed.
   He repeatedly told a throng of reporters and camera crews
afterward that the ruling left him happy. He also restated his
belief that his plight was not unusual because he feels the country
is in a recession. Once the economy improves, his assets will
rebound, he said.
   ``This is a big hurdle and I'm happy,'' Trump told reporters.
``Maybe you can focus on someone else now.''
   Trump said the first task of the financial restructuring would
be to focus on the Taj Mahal.
   Since its opening April 2, the Taj has either fallen short or
just reached the $1.3 million a day in gross gaming revenues that
analysts say it needs to break even.
   The Taj Mahal lost $14.4 million on gross revenue of $126
million in its first three months ended June 30, according to
figures released last week by the Casino Association of New Jersey.
Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had a profit of $876,000 on gross
revenues of $83.4 million, while Trump Castle lost $8.1 million on
gross revenues of $63.4 million.
   In approving the bailout package, the casino commission cited
the benefits of an immediate infusion of $65 million, deferred
interest payments on outstanding loans, and a requirement that
banks holding at least two-thirds of the loan find Trump in default
before action can be taken against him.
   The approval also came with several reservations about the Trump
Organization, which has compiled more than $3.2 billion in debt on
Trump's casinos, Manhattan real estate, Trump Shuttle airline and
yacht. The casinos bear responsibility for roughly $1.3 billion in
debt.
   Ms. Armstrong said the agreement contains destabilizing features
for the casinos, including a link between the three properties that
could prompt foreclosure at two Trump gaming halls if financial
problems arose at a third.
   ``Even more disturbing is the link the restructuring forges
between the fate of the casinos and that of other Trump assets,''
Ms. Armstrong said, using a possible bankruptcy at the Trump
Shuttle as one possible example.
   Trump faces $540.5 million in overdue debts, $240.5 million of
which he has personally guaranteed, Ms. Armstrong said. He will
face an additional $169.5 million in debt by the end of April.
   Commissioners and the division both said Trump's problems stand
out as clear reasons why other casinos should avoid assuming huge
amounts of debt.

   Companies are jamming government phone lines to find out what
benefits they are obligated to provide employees who may be called
to active duty as military reservists.
   Small business operators said Tuesday they would have the most
difficult time filling the gaps created by absent reservists called
to support operations in the Persian Gulf.
   ``It can be hurtful. It's all I've been thinking about,'' said
Ted Thomas, a dentist in solo practice in Clinton, N.C. ``I have no
one to cover for me, and my patients would have to go elsewhere for
treatment. It would almost be like starting over once I return.''
   Thomas and others like him may request exemptions if called. But
they would have to prove ``severe hardship,'' and even then there
are no guarantees, military experts said.
   For big business, the impact is softened by bigger numbers.
   ``We probably have 9,600 employees total; probably 40 to 50 are
involved in the reserves, so that small a ratio in essence wouldn't
have that big of an impact,'' said Disney Reece, director of human
resources for Memorex Telex Corp.'s storage systems group in Tulsa,
Okla.
   Medical personnel as well as people with expertise in
communications and electronics are likely to be in highest demand.
   At the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
Northport, N.Y., on Long Island, hospital officials are making
plans to replace anyone called to duty. Administrative assistant
Marlin Schuh speculated the impact will be minimal, ``unless they
took some of the critical specialists, like a skilled surgeon.''
   Though federal laws were put in place in the 1940s to protect
reservists from losing their jobs, confusion abounds. The number of
businesses seeking information on the law has tripled in the past
few days compared with normal August activity, said Maj. Austin
Smith at the Defense Department's National Committee for Employer
Support of the Guard and Reserves.
   The committee is scrambling to get guidelines out in overnight
mail to district offices that can work with businesses on a local
basis.
   ``The vast majority of employers are perfectly willing to adhere
to the law, but an awful lot of them don't understand what the
provisions are because it is used so seldomly,'' said John Tieso of
the Labor Department's Division of Veterans' Re-employment Rights.
   Under the law, reservists called out of the civilian work force
must be treated like any worker on an unpaid leave of absence. When
they return, businesses large and small must give them their old
jobs back _ or ones of equal stature _ with full seniority.
   In addition, reservists are due any increase in pay or benefits
that other workers received while they were gone. But the law also
gives employers the right to lay off a reservist if it can show the
job was eliminated while he or she was away at duty.
   Though employers aren't required to provide medical benefits,
many allow reservists to continue coverage if they pay their own
premiums.
   ``There's a good possibility that corporate coverage is better
than government coverage,'' said one officer who asked not to be
identified.
   Reservists who serve more than 30 days are covered by the
military's medical plan. A potential problem arises, Tieso said,
for those who serve under one month.
   Many businesses that have called the Labor and Defense
departments to check on the law have indicated they'll continue
medical benefits for reservists during the initial 30-day period.
   ``In a relatively unknown situation where they don't know how
long it's going to be _ it could be five days, 15 days or 150 days
_ some employers are simply saying, `Hey, don't worry about it.
We'll take care of it until you get home,' '' Tieso said.
   So far employers aren't balking over the law, Tieso said. ``Most
of them want to make it easier for these guys to go off to service.
It's a nice way to do business,'' he said.

   A synthetic hormone that can boost milk
production in dairy cows by 10 percent to 25 percent has cleared
all the safety testing it needs and merits approval for commercial
use, doctors say in a medical journal.
   The hormone, bovine somatotropin or BST, has been banned
temporarily in two states. But the doctors wrote in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association that it ``causes no
changes in milk composition of any practical importance to
consumers.''
   ``The minor differences in milk composition shown between
unsupplemented and BST-supplemented cows are well within normal
biological variation in milk composition,'' they wrote.
   The authors, Dr. William H. Daughaday of Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis, and David M. Barbano of the Food
Science Department at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., each have
done consulting or research work under grants from one of its four
manufacturers, Monsanto Co., the journal said.
   However, an editorial by an outside researcher concurred with
their conclusions, saying ``milk produced from cows treated with
bovine somatotropin is no different from the milk of untreated
cows.''
   ``It is both inappropriate and wrong for special-interest groups
to play on the health and safety fears of the public to further
their own ends,'' said the editorial, by Charles H. Grossman, an
immunologist at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Cincinnati.
   Daughaday and Barbano noted that the Food and Drug
Administration pronounced the hormone safe in 1985, and could
approve its commercial use by next year, a possibility that has
raised concerns among groups opposed to genetic engineering.
   The hormone is produced by a method similar to that used to make
synthetic human insulin.
   Critics say not enough research has been done to be sure milk
produced by cows injected with the animal hormone would be safe for
people.
   Grossman said ``hysterical reaction'' produced laws in Wisconsin
and Minnesota temporarily barring the use of bST for at least a
year.
   However, in January, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., called for an investigation
of the FDA's review of the hormone after allegations that the
review had been inadequate.

<HEAD>Judge Caps on Some Lawyers' Fees in Asbestos Litigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge supervising an overhaul of the
Manville trust fund for the first time limited fees to plaintiffs
lawyers for settling claims involving asbestos-related diseases.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who has ordered an
overhaul of the cash-strapped trust, Tuesday limited the amount
lawyers can charge clients to 20 percent of settlements in
emergency cases.
   Weinstein last month froze all payments by the trust pending a
reorganization plan except to victims who can demonstrate financial
or medical hardship. The freeze is in place until Sept. 6, when a
financial restructuring plan is due.
   An estimated one third of more than $1 billion paid to asbestos
victims since the trust was established in 1988 has gone to
attorneys handling the cases. Limits on payment arrangements
between attorneys and their clients was not ordered when the trust
was formed as part of Manville Corp.'s bankruptcy reorganization.
   Weinstein has been highly critical of the amount received by
lawyers, and had promised to reduce the payments so victims could
receive more money in the future.
   ``The matter of fees is now being considered in connection with
a restructuring of the trust's payment program,'' Weinstein wrote
in his order. ``Ongoing discussions with representative plaintiffs
lawyers are continuing.''
   The fee cap applies only to hardship claim settlements, under
which claimants must prove extreme financial need based on number
of dependents, disease prognosis, prior settlements, assets and
liabilities and other income.
   Under Weinstein's ruling, for settlements paid out over time,
the 20 percent fee limit may be collected only as each payment is
received so that victims or their families always receive 80
percent of each check.
   Attorneys were expected to challenge the cap. Many plaintiffs
lawyers have argued they have earned the amount charged by virtue
of more than a decade of work by some attorneys in the asbestos
litigation.
   ``The judge had made it clear that he anticipated some type of
reduction, though I think the reduction is more than is justified
given the amount fo work that goes into these cases,'' said Stanley
Levy, a leading asbestos plaintiffs lawyer.
   ``It also raises the question of whether he really has the
authority to interfere in the contractual relationship between a
client and the attorney,'' Levy said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who presided over the
Manville reorganization, refused to impose a limit on attorneys
fees. No other judge has sought such a limit before.
   The trust to date has settled close to 24,000 claims for more
than $1 billion from people with lung cancer and other respiratory
diseases caused by inhaling asbestos fibers, mostly during
shipbuilding and other construction.
   But the trust faces 130,000 more claims it can't meet and has
paid only two thirds of the money it owes in settled cases. The
reorganization order came after the trust said it was out of money
to pay new claims it said would not be met until well into the 21st
century.
   The trust also is under fire for a decision to hire a public
relations firm on a $10,000 monthly retainer with a $15,000 monthly
cap. The trust has paid the firm, Robinson, Lake, Lerer and
Montgomery, about $30,000 so far.
   It is unclear whether the payments violate Weinstein's freeze on
payments, but the judge has been notified about the public
relations firm's hiring, one of his law clerks said Tuesday.
   The trust eventually is expected to be consolidated with a group
of asbestos-making companies that say they can't meet asbestos
claims into a single class-action lawsuit before Weinstein.

   If you wondered why oil is worth fighting for,
take a look at Fortune magazine's latest ranking of the world's
billionaires.
   The two richest people on the face of the earth are oil barons,
the magazine reported Tuesday.
   Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, oil-rich leader of the tiny
Pacific sultanate of Brunei, retained Fortune's top title for the
fourth straight year with an estimated worth of $25 billion,
unchanged from 1989.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and clan, a focus of the Persian Gulf
crisis, ranked second with assets worth $18 billion, also unchanged
from last year.
   Fortune spokeswoman Emma Dockendorff said those estimates were
based partly on oil prices in mid-July, when one barrel of crude
fetched about $18.
   Prices have since surged to about $28 a barrel following Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the U.S. move to protect neighboring
Saudi Arabia. That price jump would make the sultan and the king
potentially even wealthier.
   The ranks of Fortune's richest _ bankrolled by assets ranging
from oil to sneakers to ball bearings _ swelled by 25 names this
year to 182 individuals and families, controlling a combined empire
worth $471.3 billion.
   That's up about 7 percent from last year and enough to erase the
U.S. budget deficit, trade deficit and a good chunk of the savings
&amp; loan bailout tab.
   Fortune released the fourth annual ranking in its Sept. 10
issue. It said the average entrant's wealth was only slightly
higher compared with last year after adjusting for inflation.
   But the average fortune was still worth about $2.6 billion,
which if invested in 7.5 percent U.S. Treasury bills would earn
$534,000 a day.
   ``True, you shouldn't feel too sorry for folks who have their
own islands and castles, use Reniors for wallpaper and control, in
the aggregate, $471.3 billion,'' Fortune said.
   As competitor Forbes magazine did in its annual list released
last month, Fortune ditched the Sultan of New York, Donald J.
Trump, whose real estate and casino empire is bogged down in debt.
The magazine had estimated his holdings at $1.7 billion last year.
   Fortune placed Trump in a separate category of fallen tycoons,
who also included troubled takeover strategist James Goldsmith and
convicted financier Michael Milken.
   Ranked third on Fortune's list was the reclusive Mars family of
the United States, whose holdings include Mars Inc. candy bars,
Uncle Ben's Rice and Kal-Kan pet food, worth $12.5 billion.
   Fourth was Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the wealthiest woman,
with an untaxed personal fortune of $11.7 billion in riches ranging
from 267,000 acres of Royal real estate to racehorses, crown jewels
and a vast stock portfolio.
   Fifth was the Newhouse family of the United States, owners of a
large media empire, worth $11.5 billion; sixth was the Reichmann
family of Canada, with extensive real estate holdings valued at
$11.1 billion; tied for seventh were Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, Japan's
richest industrialist, and Arkansas retailing mogul Sam Walton,
both valued at $7.3 billion; eighth was John W. Kluge of the United
States, owner of media giant Metromedia Inc., valued at $7.0
billion; ninth was Tsai Wan-lin and family of Taiwan, owners of a
construction and insurance empire worth $6.5 billion; 10th was the
Thomson family, owners of Canada's biggest newspaper chain, at $6.2
billion.
   American newcomers included the Stephens family of Arkansas,
owners of investment banking, energy and real estate holdings worth
$1.7 billion; the Parfet family of Kalamazoo, Mich., owners of a
large stake in the Upjohn Co. drugmaker, worth $1.5 billion; and
Philip Knight, head of the Nike Inc. athletic footwear maker, $1.3
billion.
   Foreign newcomers included Alicia and Esther Koplovitz of Spain,
owners of a $2.2 billion construction and banking fortune; Hiroshi
Termachi, owner of a $1.8 billion Japanese ball bearing business;
and John Spyros Latsis, European head of a Saudi Arabian shipping
and oil-refinery network worth $1.8 billion.
   The magazine based estimates of net worth on what it called
``published information or appraisals of asset values.'' To
qualify, each prospect needed a net worth of $1 billion or more
after subtracting debt.
   Fortune said the United States remained home to the greatest
number of billionaires at 58. Twenty were from the Persian Gulf, 15
from West Germany, nine from Italy, and eight in Japan, down from
12 last year.

$1.3 billion purchase of MGM-UA Communications Co.
   Tuesday's payment brings to $303 million the total of
non-refundable down payments that Parretti has made since March,
when Pathe began making monthly installments of roughly $50 million.
   Another $50 million deposit is due Sept. 20 and the agreement
calls for Parretti, chief of Pathe, to come up with the nearly $950
million balance by Oct. 23.
   ``The company is confident it will complete the deal as
planned,'' said Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons.
   Parretti and Kirk Kerkorian, who controls MGM-UA, agreed to the
monthly installments after Pathe failed to come to terms with its
major backer, Time Warner Inc.
   For the four-month extension granted Pathe, MGM-UA stockholders
will get $21.50 a share from the deal, up from the original $20 a
share.
   Time Warner had agreed to provide a $650 million loan to Pathe
for the deal in return for a lien on the valuable United Artists
film library and extensive distribution rights to Pathe and UA
movies.
   But that part of the deal fell apart, and Time Warner has sued
Pathe for $100 million, accusing Pathe of breaching its contract
by, among other things, double-selling some distribution rights.
   The media conglomerate said Pathe apparently never was able to
meet one of the terms of the deal: that it come up with the other
half up with the $1.3 billion in money that was not borrowed.
   Pathe counter-sued for $500 million, saying Time Warner had
breached its contractual duty to provide the $650 million loan.

   The money to start King Broadcasting Co. came
from timber, and much of the half-billion dollars expected from its
sale will be plowed back into timber.
   The sisters who control the company said Tuesday they are
putting the privately-held media company up for sale and plan to
use the proceeds for preserving the environment.
   ``There are some real environmental crises right now that we
have the opportunity to meet,'' Harriet Stimson Bullitt said.
   ``If we have a chance to contribute to the salmon coming back to
a clean river or to see the sparkle of the water and smell the
freshness of the air and the earth of the forests and to see the
forests continue to grow ... that would be the most exciting
prospect for us,'' she said.
   Bullitt, chairwoman of the executive committee of King, and
Priscilla Collins, chairwoman of the board, said they expected more
than $500 million from the sale.
   They said they wanted to put more money into their Bullitt
Foundation's environmental efforts, and wanted to find a
satisfactory buyer before either of their deaths forced a sale.
   Bullitt is 65 while Collins is 69.
   King owns six television stations in the Northwest and Hawaii,
six radio stations in Seattle, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco,
and 13 cable television systems in Washington, Idaho, California
and Minnesota.
   King was founded by Dorothy Stimson Bullitt, mother of the two
women.
   Dorothy Bullitt, who died last year at age 97, was the daughter
of Seattle lumberman and developer Charles Douglas Bullitt. She
founded King when she bought a struggling Seattle radio station in
1946 and renamed it KING.
   In 1948, she bought KRSC-TV and subsequently renamed it KING-TV.
   Stock owned by Collins and Harriett Bullitt, along with that
left by their late mother and now controlled by them, makes up
about 70 percent of the privately held company's shares.
   Puget Sound Business Journal has estimated King's 1988 annual
revenues at about $150 million and said King has approximately
1,200 employees.
   The company could be worth as much as $650 million, said media
analyst Bishop Cheen of Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel, Calif.
   He said the company may have to be sold in pieces, since credit
has become tighter, and a buyer of the whole operation would have
to obtain several waivers from the Federal Communications
Commission to own radio and TV stations in the same market.
   King's properties include television stations KING, Seattle;
KGW, Portland; KREM, Spokane; KTVB, Boise, Idaho; K38AS, Twin
Falls, Idaho; and KHNL, Honolulu. Its radio stations are KING-AM
and KING-FM in Seattle, KINK-FM and KGW-AM in Portland and KSFO-AM
and KYA-FM in San Francisco.
   The company owns cable systems in Brooklyn Park and St. Croix,
Minn.; Los Angeles, Santa Clarita, Riverside County, Lodi,
Placerville, San Andreas, Mammoth Lakes and Mount Shasta, Calif.;
Twin Falls and American Falls, Idaho; and Ellensburg, Wash. In all,
the systems have more than 200,000 subscribers.
   King also owns Northwest Mobile Television, the nation's largest
mobile production company.

   The stock market edged upward today, mounting
another attempt to rally after its steep summer slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .74 to 2,604.70 in

   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.99 million shares as of 10

situation in the Middle East.
   Prompted by such developments as the sharp rise in oil prices,
Wall Streeters have curtailed their hopes for a recovery any time
soon in U.S. corporate profits.
   Stock markets in other financial centers around the world remain
on the defensive amid fears of increased inflationary pressures and

   Soybean futures prices opened steady to a little
higher this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade. Grains were
mixed in light trading.
   A lack of any overnight developments in grain trade gave the
markets a sluggish tone.
   Traders said the six- to 10-day weather forecast due after the

tends to be bearish for the market. The nation's major soybean and

<HEAD>Hotel Whiz Tries to Save Trump's Empire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years ago, Stephen F. Bollenbach saved
hotel-gaming giant Holiday Corp. from a hostile takeover attempt by
developer Donald J. Trump. Now he's trying to save Trump from
himself.
   Trump recently picked Bollenbach as chief financial officer for
his debt-swamped gambling and real estate holdings to satisfy a key
creditor demand.
   Banks had agreed to loan Trump $65 million this summer on the
condition he appoint a financial officer by Sept. 30, among other
things. The loan was needed to help make a payment on junk bonds
used to finance Trump's three Atlantic City, N.J., casinos, which
were put up as collateral for the loan.
   Bollenbach _ who joined the Trump Organization several days ago
after being CFO for Holiday spinoff Promus Cos. of Memphis, Tenn. _
will serve as a liaison between Trump and the banks. He says he's
confident he can help his old adversary escape the clutches of
borrowed money.
   ``We've got some really terrific assets _ like this hotel,'' the
47-year-old Bollenbach said during an interview at Trump's posh
Plaza Hotel, Bollenbach's home in New York. ``But they draw their
business from the Northeast . . . an area that's in an economic
downturn.''
   Bollenbach said Trump will have to overcome a dwindling pool of
financing sources thanks to the collapse of the high-yield,
high-risk junk bond market and stricter lending policies among
commericial banks.
   ``It's put him in a bind,'' he said in a recent interview. ``We
need to finance our way through the slow times. The solution is to
make sure we keep costs down.''
   But easing the flamboyant developer's $3.3 billion total debt
burden will take some time, Bollenbach conceded.
   Bollenbach has begun by turning his attention to Atlantic City,
which, like the real estate industry, remains in a slump. He said
he's looking for cheaper ways to attract casino customers and
increase gambling revenues.
   ``This is their (customers) selected form of entertainment. But
like all selected forms of entertainment, you've got to make sure
you don't spend more on getting your customers there than it's
worth,'' he said.
   The New Jersey Casino Association said Atlantic City's 12
casinos recorded their first losing second quarter since gambling
began there in 1978. Trump's recently opened Taj Mahal alone lost
$14.1 million.
   Bollenbach, the son of a southern California milkman, is a
personable family man with salt-and-pepper hair and a close-cropped
beard. He and his wife, Barbara, share homes in Memphis and
Greenwich, Conn.
   He said he hadn't meet Trump until this summer. But the two have
known of each other for years.
   Bollenbach is credited with fending off Trump's takeover attempt
of Holiday Corp. in 1987, a year after Bollenbach joined the firm.
   The company, which owned Harrah's casinos and smaller hotel
groups in addition to Holiday Inns, had been considered
undervalued. That prompted some shareholders, including Trump, to
increase their stakes in Holiday.
   Bollenbach was behind a $2.4 billion recapitalization plan that
ultimately raised Holiday's debt and made the company less
attractive as a takeover target.
   ``We borrowed $2.8 billion, paid a $65 dividend to shareholders,
and over the next couple of years, we sold real estate,'' he
explained.
   The plan kept Trump away but it also made him between $18
million to $30 million richer, Bollenbach noted.
   Holiday was sold to British brewing giant Bass PLC last spring.
Promus was spun off after the sale.
   Bollenbach's business career took off in 1968 when he went to
work for Daniel K. Ludwig, a Phoenix, Ariz., shipping magnate and
industrialist who also owned a chain of savings and loans. He
worked his way up through Ludwig's company and was its chief
financial officer when he was hired by Marriott Corp. in 1981.
   Bollenbach said Marriott's then-chairman, Gary Wilson, broadened
the role of CFO to make it more involved in the total business.
   Although there was a certain comfort in working at Promus _ ``a
great job with people I like to work with'' _ Bollenbach says he's
ready for his next challenge, one that is likely to raise his
public profile.
   ``I keep thinking of what Andy Warhol said about everybody being
famous for 15 minutes,'' he said. ``I'd settle for four or five _
maybe even two.''

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with close in Europe, midday quotes in New

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell in European trading Wednesday
amid growing uncertainty over the Gulf crisis.
   Gold recovered some ground lost overnight but prices were still
lower and dealers said trading remained cautious.
   Dealers in London said there were no significant developments in
the Gulf to move the foreign exchanges.
   Anticipation that U.S. interest rates would be eased to prevent
a deep recession was drawing attention to currencies of countries
where interest rates are expected to stay firm, dealers said.
   One of the main beneficiaries was the Swiss franc, dealers said.
The Swiss currency has been seen as a safer investment than the
dollar after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait prompted the U.S. to
send a major force to the region.
   Speculation about U.S. interest rates was heightened by
Wednesday's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market
Committee, a body of monetary officials due to debate the issue of
rate cuts.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.92 Japanese yen, up 0.37 yen
from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar retreated to
145.85 yen, and in New York, the dollar was quoted at 145.905 yen
at midday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9275 from $1.9215 late
Tuesday, and in New York, sterling was quoted at $1.9250.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.5535 German marks, down from 1.5545; 1.2735
Swiss francs, down from 1.2855; 5.2260 French francs, down from
5.2325; 1.7500 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7530; 1,159.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,155.75; and 1.1363 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1437.
   Other midday quotes for the dollar in New York included: 1.5535
German marks, 1.27575 Swiss francs, 1160.625 Italian lire and
1.13645 Canadian dollars.
   Zurich dealers said fluctuations in the gold price showed the
market was nervous as a result of uncertainty over the Gulf.
   ``People are waiting for news,'' said a dealer. ``Until then,
they'll lean toward caution.''
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $410.25 a troy ounce
from $413.25 late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $410.25 from
$414.75 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.24 to close at a bid $408.69.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.15 a
troy ounce from $5.20 late Tuesday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed mixed in choppy trading on the
London Stock Exchange Wednesday after an early surge evaporated in
the wake of Wall Street's downturn.
   Stocks rose throughout the morning in a technical adjustment to
recent sharp drops, dealers said. But once shortages were filled,
demand for shares effectively dried up, they said.
   Wall Street advanced at the opening bell but then did an
about-face and headed into negative territory, taking London shares
lower in late trading, commentators said.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 22.03 points lower at
2,581.93 by the end of the European day.
   ``It was a nothing kind of day,'' said one London trader. ``Once
short positions were covered up, there was really no news to
activate the market.''
   The closely watched Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index closed at 2,104.8, a loss of 3.3 points, or 0.2 percent,
slightly better than the day's 2,104.3 minimum. The peak was
2,127.0.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index stood at 1,622.5, up
6.8 points. The broader 500-share index finished at 1,134.91, down
1.03 points.
   Volume registered 338.0 million issues, lower than the 412.4
million shares changing hands a day ago.

<HEAD>Dalkon Shield Trust Fund Still Contains $2.3 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY O'DELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although more than half of the 195,000 Dalkon
Shield claimants have been paid, more than $2.3 billion is still
available to women who were injured by the birth control device, a
trust fund official said Wednesday.
   The fund contained $2.5 billion when it was established last
year. But a significant portion still remains because of the size
of payments thus far and the fact the fund is drawing $500,000 per
day in interest, said Julie Freeman, the fund's manager of claimant
relations.
   Ms. Freeman said the trust fund would shrink more rapidly as
more large claims are paid.
   The Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, manufactured by the
Richmond-based A.H. Robins Co. in the 1970s, was used by nearly 4
million women around the world, said Linda Hightower of Atlanta,
director of the Dalkon Shield Victims Association.
   Lawsuits filed by women who claimed to be injured by the device
forced Robins to file for bankruptcy reorganization in 1985. Women
who used the product reported a variety of injuries, including
sterility, miscarriages and pelvic inflammatory disease.
   Robins later was acquired by the American Home Products
pharmaceutical company.
   Ms. Freeman said most of the claims paid so far were filed under
an option that limits payments to $725. Under that option,
claimants do not have to document their injuries.
   A second option allows claims of up to $5,500, while a third
provides for ``substantially higher'' payments, Ms. Freeman said.
She said the fund was not releasing a figure on how high those
claims could reach.
   Ms. Hightower said the largest settlement she has heard about
was $195,000.
   ``The trust won't say how many option 3 claims they've paid,''
she said. ``They say they're three months ahead of schedule. I
don't know what their schedule was, but it must have been real
slow.''
   Ms. Freeman said she is satisfied with the progress in settling
the claims. She said about 81,000 claimants still must decide which
of the three options to pursue before payments can be made. Women
have until next July 1 to make a decision. Payments are pending for
about 15,000 claimants who have chosen an option.
   Women who have not yet filed a claim still may do so, Ms.
Freeman said. However, late claims will be the last ones
considered, she said.
   Ralph Pittle, a Seattle lawyer whose firm represents more than
900 claimants, said his company continues to receive calls from
women who were injured by the device but did not know they could
file a claim.
   ``Granted, there was an extensive advertising campaign, but not
everyone watches TV, listens to radio or reads newspapers,'' he
said. ``Some people just have a hard time surviving.''

   Glen Renfrew, managing director and chief
executive of Reuters Holdings PLC, has sold 20 percent of his

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading was mixed and sluggish through much of the session, but
prices firmed on the belief that the Soviet Union is in the market
for cooking oil.
   ``Rumors surfaced late the day that the Russians were buying, or
interested in buying, bottled vegetable oil from South America,''
said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president with Dean

   He said this report was enough to lift prices higher in most

   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3\ cents higher with the

   Stock prices declined broadly again today after
an early attempt to rally fizzled out.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points in
early trading, was down 12.13 at 2,591.83 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   From July 16 through Tuesday's close, the average fell 395.79
points to its lowest level in almost six months.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 480 up,
1,039 down and 438 unchanged.
   Buyers have appeared sporadically in recent days, apparently
acting on hopes that the markets might have gone to extremes in
their appraisal of the potential fallout from Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   But a good many analysts questioned whether stocks had fully
adjusted to the increased recession risks arising from the
situation in the Middle East.
   Prompted by such developments as the sharp rise in oil prices,
Wall Streeters have curtailed their hopes for a recovery any time
soon in U.S. corporate profits.
   Stock markets in other financial centers around the world remain
on the defensive amid fears of increased inflationary pressures and
higher interest rates.

<TEXT>
   Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. hopes to charter
some of its 30 oil and products tankers that have been idled by the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, oil industry sources said Wednesday.
   The tanker company, an affiliate of the state-run Kuwait
Petroleum Corp., wants to offset the losses it's incurred because
of the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Oil industry sources said one chartering deal is already under
discussion and could be completed next month. The tankers have been
on charter to Kuwait Petroleum, and would now be subchartered, said
the sources, who spoke on condition they not be named.
   None of Kuwait's fleet of oil and products tankers was caught in
the country at the time of the invasion. Some are still delivering
crude oil loaded before the invasion to the Kuwait Petroleum
International network in Europe.
   The 30 tankers have a total of 2.56 million tons capacity. But
the cutoff of Kuwaiti oil installations and refineries leaves
Kuwait Petroleum with substantial excess tanker capacity, industry
sources said.
   With the oil installations and refineries in Kuwait cut off by
the Iraqi occupation, KPC is concentrating on the refining and
marketing operations in Europe, which are run by Kuwait Petroleum
International.

<HEAD>Washington Post Co. To Enter Market for Pocket-Sized Phones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Post Co. on Wednesday said it
has joined with American Personal Communications Inc. to develop a
new pocket-sized, wireless telephone service for the Washington
area.
   Maryland-based AMC is the general partner in the limited
partnership, which expects to begin testing an experimental phone
system by the end of the year and be fully operational by the end
of 1991, the companies said.
   Initially, the system would allow only one-way, outbound calling
in Washington and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs, much like pay
phones. Such service already is in use in Great Britain.
   The companies could jointly invest up to $6 million in the
testing phase, Post spokesman Guyon Knight said. He would not
speculate on what the overall development cost would be.
   The system is one of a number of Federal Communications
Commission-sanctioned experiments in ``personal communications
networks'' that proponents hope eventually will replace existing
cellular and wired phone systems, particularly in office buildings.
   These proponents envision that someday all calls will be made
not to locations, but to people, wherever they are, who would carry
tiny phones with them.
   Wayne N. Schelle, AMC's chairman, said these new types of
wireless phones are expected to be smaller, lighter and less
expensive than today's portable cellular phones.
   ``Every member of a family or employee of a business will be
able to carry a phone in their pocket in the same way they
currently carry their keys or wallet,'' Schelle said in a statement.
   The folding phones, which will resemble a travel alarm clock,
may be sold for as little as $75, AMC says.
   Customers would be able to make calls whenever they are in range
of refrigerator-sized transmitting stations that would link callers
with the public phone network or to other users of the wireless
system.
   The system will use digital ``spread spectrum'' technology that
allows a single call to switch back and forth continually to
whatever frequency is available. The low-power radio signals will
have ranges of only a few hundred feet, which means they will have
less tendency to interfere with each other.
   This approach should dramatically increase the capacity _ and
thus lower the costs _ for a personal communications network
compared with today's cellular systems, which use more power to
operate over longer distances on a relatively restricted number of
channels. However, the low-power devices do not work well in moving
automobiles.
   AMC received permission from the FCC earlier this year to test
the new phone service for up to 2,000 users, but the FCC is still
deciding whether to allot precious radio airspace to these new
types of services.
   The companies said that if the FCC approves full development of
the new service, it will consider expanding to other U.S. cities.
   The Washington Post Co., whose holdings include The Washington
Post newspaper, in 1983 won a cellular phone franchise with AMC for
the Washington-Baltimore area. The Post no longer is in that
partnership, Knight said.

<HEAD>Middle East Crisis Is Not The Cause For Low Interest In Gulf Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's sale of oil and gas
leases in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday drew few participants,
but officials said the low turnout had nothing to do with Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Many people might expect the Middle East to affect the sale,
but oftentimes big oil companies have already developed their
bidding strategy,'' said Ed Cassidy, deputy director of the
Minerals Management Service of the Department of Interior.
   One of the oil company representatives, who asked that his name
not be used, said most companies had already budgeted this year's
exploration before the Iraq-Kuwait invasion, which has pushed crude
prices up 70 percent and made exploration for untapped reserves
much more attractive.
   Shell Offshore Inc. offered the high bid of the day, $6.37
million for a tract off Cameron, La.
   Wednesday's high bids totaled $162.4 million. In all, 70
companies put up $240.9 million for the 4,792 tracts offered. Each
tract is about 5,000 acres and most lie off the Texas coast.
   Cassidy said the area has traditionally yielded more natural gas
than oil.
   ``That's another reason why the Middle East crisis is not
directly affecting this sale,'' he said.
   Officials said the area held potential reserves of 100 million
barrels of oil and 1.48 trillion cubic feet of gas.
   ``Today's sale is a bit smaller that we expected, but there's no
direct correlation to the Middle East situation,'' said Charlie
Howell, a Mobil representative. ``It's just a matter of generating
the prospects.''

<HEAD>Trial Begins in Boeing Toxic-Waste Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. has taken its insurance companies
to court in a bid to settle an $80 million dispute over who should
pay to clean up toxic wastes at two Seattle-area sites.
   The insurance companies have refused to pay for cleanup closts.
They contend Boeing knew it was polluting Western Processing in
Kent and Queen City Farms in Maple Valley.
   But during opening statements in court Tuesday, Boeing attorneys
told a U.S. District Court jury that the aircraft manufacturer
never expected its practices would cause widespread pollution at
the sites.
   Boeing ``believes its insurance policies should have been
honored, and they have not been,'' said Robert Sayler, an attorney
for the company.
   Boeing has told its insurers it could be liable for cleanup
costs at 13 sites in six states, which could run into hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   Boeing dumped 24 million gallons of liquid wastes into pits at
Western Processing and Queen City Farms.
   In the 1980s, the company agreed to pay the bulk of the cleanup
costs _ more than $80 million _ at the sites under court-ordered
consent decrees with the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
   Sayler said Boeing began using Queen City Farms in 1957 because
it preferred a ``remote lagoon'' over dumping its wastes in the
Duwamish River or Puget Sound. Boeing had been barging its wastes
to sea for dumping before 1957, said Charles Gordon, another
company attorney.
   In 1964, Gordon said, Boeing began taking its wastes to Western
Processing because that company was recycling. The state also
recommended the move.
   Boeing never anticipated the problems that would occur at the
sites, and the company's decisions must be viewed in the context of
environmental standards that have evolved over the years, Sayler
and Gordon told the jury.
   The insurance companies named as defendants include Aetna
Casualty &amp; Surety Co., Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., Insurance
Co. of North American and Ronald E. Smith &amp; Cos., an association of
syndicates that includes Lloyds of London.

<TEXT>
   Stephen A. Schwartz, president of the
Playskool division of toymaker Hasbro Inc., has stepped down in a
management shakeup that would have moved him down the corporate
chain of command.
   Hasbro's announcement Tuesday said Schwartz, 41, resigned ``to
pursue other business opportunities.''
   Under Schwartz, Playskool was Hasbro's fastest-growing division
during the past two years, taking on the Fisher-Price unit of
Quaker Oats Co.
   Playskool, whose products include Mr. Potato Head and
Tinkertoys, generated about $352 million in domestic sales last
year, or about 25 percent of Hasbro's $1.4 billion in worldwide net
sales.
   Under the new arrangement, Schwartz would have reported to
Alfred J. Verrecchia, who has been made chief operating officer for
Hasbro's domestic toy operations. Schwartz had been reporting
directly to Alan G. Hassenfeld, Hasbro chairman and chief executive.
   Paul H. Valentine, toy industry analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., said Schwartz, who joined Hasbro in 1978, was ``one of the
guiding lights of Hasbro through the 1980s'' when the company grew
rapidly.
   But recently Hasbro's sales have lagged, and Verrecchia may have
been appointed to oversee domestic toy operations because he has
more of a financial background, analysts suggested.
   Hassenfeld did not comment in the statement about Schwartz's
departure and was not available for comment. The management
restructuring cuts in half the number of people reporting to the
chairman and will allow Hassenfeld to concentrate on strategic
plans for the company, Verrecchia said.

   Crude oil futures soared above $30 a barrel for
the first time in nearly five years Wednesday, as traders reacted
to fears of military escalation in the Middle East showdown.
   Nervous trading also pushed unleaded gasoline futures to a
record high closing price.
   Analysts said world supplies were starting to feel the crunch of
4 million barrels of crude lost each day through the boycott of
Iraq and Kuwait. The Saudi Arabians also curtailed some previously
arranged sales of jet fuel and other products to accommodate the
massive military buildup on their soil.
   ``The main factor here in the crude market, apart from a concern
of hostilities, is simply the fact that OPEC continues to drag its
feet in getting higher production,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Indications that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela want to increase
production have not materialized into any more oil.
   The price of October contracts for light, sweet crude shot up
$2.51 per 42-gallon barrel to close at $31.22 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Oil last traded above the $30 threshold on
Nov. 26, 1985.
   Unleaded gasoline prices on the Merc closed at $1.043 per gallon
for September delivery, up 2.99 cents over Tuesday's record close
of $1.013 per gallon. The near-term contract has closed higher for
six straight trading days.
   Those following the industry said consumers will be paying even
more for gasoline at the pump, although analysts said there was no
firm way to translate the rise in futures prices to a predictable
rise in retail prices.
   One analyst said a 1-cent rise in unleaded futures can mean a
1-cent increase at the pump.
   Wall Street traders were generally surprised by the abrupt jump
of crude over the $30 per barrel mark.
   ``As long as this standoff continued, I had expected pretty
volatile markets in the $25 to $30 range,'' said Stephen Smith, an
oil analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
   Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., said markets shot up partially in reaction to news
that Saudi Arabia was cancelling some of its sales contracts in a
move to supply oil products to the international military forces
that have converged on the Persian Gulf.
   ``The concrete news that came into the market this morning was
the cutback in Saudi Arabia's product export availability,'' Hittle
said. ``First, we lost Kuwait: 690,000 barrels a day. Now, the Far
East and some U.S. majors have lost volume from the Saudis on top
of that. There is also a lot of concern that this situation could
get worse.''
   Traders had no firm numbers for the size of the Saudi cutbacks,
Hittle said.
   While markets were still open Wednesday afternoon, President
Bush announced he was ordering military reservists to active duty
in the Persian Gulf, telling a news conference that the United
States will not retreat from the hard line it has taken against
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
   ``The conference was not reassuring to the market,'' Hittle said.
   ``What the market is looking for at this point is a clear sign
that there will not be any military escalation. It's still nervous.
Everybody is still buying. If there's a change in the political or
military situation, then we'll see a change for sure, but I can't
predict that.''
   Inventories of oil available to the world market have declined
by about 80 million barrels, from the 250 million barrel range,
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Smith said.
   ``The Saudis and the Venezuelans and the United Arab Emirates
have been talking about increased production to offset the missing
oil, but so far it's been mostly talk,'' Smith said.
   In other products traded on the Merc, home heating oil rose 7.64
cents per gallon to 91.35 cents for September delivery, while
natural gas moved up from $1.420 to $1.428 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to weaken Wednesday as the
foreign exchange markets remained nervous about events in the
Persian Gulf. Gold prices were mixed.
   Analysts said the dollar fluctuated in a narrow range as traders
awaited new developments from the Middle East.
   Earl Johnson, an assistant vice president at Harris Trust &amp; Co.
in Chicago, said the dollar had some support from fears that war
would break out, but lost ground on continuing concerns about the
slowing U.S. economy.
   ``It's basically a nervous market,'' he said.
   Investors were reluctant to make major moves in any direction,
Johnson said.
   Overseas dealers said traders continued to buy currencies of
nations where interest rates were expected to remain high. The
markets believed U.S. rates would be eased to prevent a recession,
analysts said.
   The British pound, one of the currencies supported by high
rates, continued to climb against the dollar. Sterling rose to
$1.9235 in New York from late Tuesday's $1.9113. In earlier London
trading, the pound rose to $1.9275 from $1.9215.
   The dollar fell to 146.15 Japanese yen in New York from 146.80
yen late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 146.92
yen, up 0.37 yen from Tuesday, and the U.S. currency was quoted at
145.85 yen in late London trading.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5575 German marks, down from 1.5645;
1.2775 Swiss francs, down from 1.2900; 5.2390 French francs, down
from 5.2635; and 1.13535 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13985.
   The dollar did manage to post a slight gain against the Italian
lire, rising to 1,162.25 lire in New York from 1,161.75 late
Tuesday. In Europe earlier, the dollar rose to 1,159.00 lire from
1,155.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.5535 German marks, down from 1.5545; 1.2735
Swiss francs, down from 1.2855; 5.2260 French francs, down from
5.2325; 1.7500 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7530; and 1.1363
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1437.
   Gold prices were higher in New York after falling in Europe.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold rose
$3.60 to $411, while Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of
$412.50, up $5.60 from Tuesday.
   Overseas dealers said fluctuations in the price of gold
reflected the market's nervousness over the Gulf.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $410.25 a troy ounce
from $413.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing
bid of $410.25 from $414.75 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.24 to close at a bid $408.69.
   Silver rose on the Commodity Exchange, picking up 3.8 cents to
close at $5.129 a troy ounce. In London earlier, silver fell to a
late bid price of $5.15 a troy ounce from late Tuesday's $5.20.

<HEAD>Thrift Head Accused of Embezzling Over $1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former savings and loan president has been
charged by federal prosecutors with embezzling more than $1 million
from the thrift.
   Richard Kukielski, who headed West Town Savings &amp; Loan in
suburban Cicero, was accused Tuesday of accepting 212 worthless
checks from a customer between 1982 and 1987 to conceal his
misappropriations of the S&amp;L's money.
   Prosecutors said Kukielski cashed the checks with money from the
vault and hid the processed checks in his desk drawer. Then,
prosecutors said, he juggled the S&amp;L's ledgers to conceal his
activities from auditors.
   If convicted on all three counts he faces, Kukielski could be
imprisoned for 15 years and fined $750,000, prosecutors said.

   Here are selected excerpts from the
New Jersey Casino Control Commission's ruling Tuesday allowing
Donald Trump to use his three casinos as collateral for a $65
million loan:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>THE AGREEMENTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   There are two essential restructuring documents, the credit
agreement and the override agreement.
   Under the credit agreement, seven banks will grant a $65 million
line of credit to Trump. The initial draw will be $40 million, $20
million of which will replace $20 million previously loaned to meet
an interest payment on the Trump Castle bonds. The remainder is to
be used in accordance with a business plan.
   Interest on borrowings under the credit agreement will be
payable currently. Principal repayment will be deferred until the
agreement expires. The agreement is for three years, extendable to
five years at Trump's option if he satisfies various conditions,
including supplying a new business plan acceptable to the seven
banks covering the additional two years.
   The override agreement is between Trump and the nine banks which
hold the $1 billion in restructuring debt, $840 million of which
hold the $1 billion in restructuring debt, $840 million of which
affords potential recourse for Trump because it is guaranteed by
him or is debt of a partnership in which he is a general partner.
   The nine banks include the seven signatories to the credit
agreement. The principal and, in most cases, the interest on the $1
billion will be deferred for five years. In addition, the banks
will observe a five-year moratorium on recourse against Trump.
   For his part, Trump has agreed to pledge all of the equity in
his casino companies.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>DEFAULT PROVISIONS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As long as there is any outstanding loan under the credit
agreement, the seven signatory banks may declare a default, by a
vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding amount of the
loan, upon the occurrence of an ``event of default.''
   Events of default include:
   _ A payment default under the credit agreement.
   _ The breach of any term of the credit agreement.
   _ The failure to keep any loan document in full force and effect.
   _ A payment default on any indebtedness of Trump or his
affiliates, other than the Trump Shuttle, of over $5 million.
   _ A bankruptcy or other judicial declaration of insolvency by
Trump or any of his affiliates.
   _ The failure of Trump or any of his affiliates to make payments
to certain employee benefit plans.
   _ Any judgment of over $5 million against Trump or his
affiliates, other than the Trump Shuttle, which remains unpaid for
80 days.
   _ Any material adverse change in the condition, financial or
otherwise, of Trump or his affiliates.
   _ Any governmental action which materially and adversely affects
the ability of Trump and his affiliates to operate the casinos.
   _ Any restructuring of the equity of any casino company.
   _ Trump's death or incapacity.
   If a default is declared following any event of default, the
seven banks may take any action provided in the credit agreement,
including foreclosing on the equity in the casinos.

<BYLINE>FINANCIAL STABILITY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   If the commission is in fact convinced that the restructuring
will leave the casinos more stable than it found them, petitioners'
contention that we need not conduct a full stability hearing at
this point is persuasive. Whether the record establishes the
salutary effect of the restructuring is, however, a difficult and
troublesome question.
   It is obvious that the restructuring will confer substantial
benefits on the Trump Organization, and on the casinos as assets of
that organization. There will be $65 million in fresh capital and
the debt service on $1 billion in existing loans will be deferred.
There will also be a moratorium on recourse against Mr. Trump,
which will have the effect of protecting his assets, including the
equity in the casinos, from creditors.
   On the other hand, there are features of this restructuring
which could be extremely destabilizing to the casinos.
   Absent the restructuring, if one of the casinos were to default
on its existing debt, it would presumably attempt to reach an
accommodation with its lenders, such as a debt-for-equity exchange.
Failing that, it might suffer a foreclosure of the casino hotel and
a sale to a qualified buyer. ... In the alternative, it might go
into bankruptcy.
   The commission has dealt with all of these alternatives in the
past, and could surely deal with any of them again with respect to
a Trump property. As of today, none of these alternatives with
respect to one Trump casino would necessarily have any effect on
the other two. If the restructuring is effectuated, however, each
of these alternatives will be an event of default ... and could
lead to a foreclosure on the equity of all three properties. Thus,
the restructuring links the fate of the three properties, and
increases the likelihood that financial problems at one would lead
to foreclosure of the others.
   Even more disturbing is the link the restructuring forges
between the fate of the casinos and that of other Trump assets. If,
for example, the Trump Shuttle goes into bankruptcy, or employee
benefit fund payments are not made at the New York Plaza Hotel, or
real estate taxes are not paid on the Penn Railroad Yards, the
credit and override agreement banks could calla default.
   We are thus being asked to tie the fate of the three casinos to
a host of events which have nothing to do with their individual or
collective financial condition.
   We are being told that foreclosure on the casino equity, whether
through judgments or bankruptcy of the Trump Organization, is a
virtual certainty without this restructuring, but may be avoided if
the restructuring is consummated.
   This is obviously a situation in which there is are no good
answers for Mr. Trump or for New Jersey. Whether we approve or
disapprove this restructuring, our action will be fundamentally
unsettling.
   It is clear that, absent some form of restructuring, the casino
equity will be reached by creditors holding liens on the non-casino
assets. Second, in view of the enormous time and effort put into
this proposal, and in view of the absence of non-casino assets in
which the Trump Organization has substantial equity, it is highly
unlikely that rejection of this proposal will lead to another
restructuring which will not include a pledge of the casino equity.
   The risk of substantial economic disruption at the casinos will
be less with the restructuring than it is without it.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Turn Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A growing supply of pork and a break in cash market prices
combined Wednesday to send hog futures prices skidding at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork bellies also were big losers, with the contract for
delivery in August falling the limit 2 cents a pound for the second
straight day.
   On other markets, petroleum futures surged ahead strongly,
grains and soybeans were mostly higher and gold advanced.
   Hog futures were dragged lower by the nearby October contract,
which was down as much as 1.10 cents a pound.
   ``That contract reflected a fairly substantial break in fresh
pork loins this week and in cash hogs,'' said Charles Levitt,
senior livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In addition, there's a seasonal increase in hogs being brought
to market that's causing some supply problems, he said.
   Bellie futures were undercut by two days of sharp declines in
the price of fresh pork bellies.
   An added problem for pork prices may appear Friday when the USDA
issues its monthly cold storage report.
   ``This report could show a very large supply of turkeys in
storage,'' Levitt said. ``If it does, there could be some cheap
turkeys around that could compete with some of the pork products
during the fall and winter holiday seasons.''
   Cattle prices settled higher, rebounding from losses suffered
after a government report last week showed a large increase in
cattle placed on feed lots.
   The big increase was in July, and these animals won't be coming
to market until the end of the year.
   ``We'll still have some tightness this fall,'' said Levitt.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .42 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in October at 78.22 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .35 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August at 89.52
cents a pound; live hogs were .75 cent lower to .02 cent higher
with October at 48.55 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were
.60 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with August at 45.72 cents a
pound.
   Deepening fears on the Middle East crisis sent oil futures
soaring past the $30 mark on the New York Mercantile Exchange for
the first time since Nov. 26, 1985.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil advanced the limit $1 on the
distant contracts to $2.51 on the October delivery, which settled
at $31.22 a barrel; heating oil was 4.31 cents to 7.64 cents higher
with September at 91.35 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was
2.95 cents to 5.66 cents higher with September at $1.0411 a gallon.
   Precious metals futures advanced on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, but lacked the volitility of previous days, despite sharp
movements in oil prices.
   The situation in the Middle East is too uncertain, said John
O'Connell, manager of futures research for Refco Inc. in New York.
   ``Most of the guys (trading in gold) have turned a little
cautious,'' he said. ``Any fall in crude could hurt them as well.''
   Gold futures settled $3.30 to $4 higher with the August contract
at $411 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly a little higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading was mixed and sluggish through much of the session, but
prices improved on the belief that the Soviet Union is in the
market for cooking oil.
   ``Rumors surfaced late the day that the Russians were buying, or
interested in buying, bottled vegetable oil from South America,''
said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat futures were 2 cents to 3\ cents higher with the September
contract at $2.82\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 2 cents
higher with September at $2.53} a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1
cent lower with September at $1.16} a bushel; and soybeans were 3\
cents to 7 cents higher with August at $6.15\ a bushel.

<HEAD>Automakers Handing Over Proposals to UAW</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Each of the nation's Big Three automakers
on Thursday are expected to give the United Auto Workers union
comprehensive proposals for new three-year contracts.
   It's likely that the UAW will not have much immediate reaction
as they compare the documents from General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   The proposals will help the union decide, probably on Tuesday,
which company will be chosen as the union's target in this round of
talks. If tradition holds, the union will use a contract reached
with the target company as a pattern for contracts at the other two
automakers. Most of the speculation about the target company
centers on GM.
   ``What happens here at these tables and at General Motors and
Chrysler in the next few days will have a direct bearing as to who
that target company will be,'' UAW President Owen Bieber said
Wednesday during a visit to Ford.
   ``Since all of them have indicated they would like to be the
target, they have a decision to make of whether they would be the
quarterback or the substitute sitting on the bench.''
   Automakers like to be the target since it gives them an
opportunity to form a pattern agreement to their liking rather than
one meeting the needs of a competitor.
   Chief Ford negotiator Jack Hall declined Wednesday to discuss
the upcoming proposal, saying only: ``We think it is going to be
responsive to the needs the union has expressed to us.''
   Bieber has been making the rounds at each of the Big Three this
week, reminding negotiators that less than four weeks remain in the
lives of the current agreements.
   The three contracts cover more than 450,000 active workers and
expire Sept. 14.
   Bieber on Wednesday visited Ford, where the atmosphere at the
main bargaining table and in subcommittee meetings is less charged
than at GM or Chrysler.
   As he did at GM on Monday and was expected to do Thursday at
Chrysler, Bieber said he was disappointed that Ford had not offered
a comprehensive proposal before now.
   ``If I had my druthers, I would wish that we would be further
along than we are,'' Bieber said. ``However, I would also say that
I'm convinced that there is ample time left to conclude an
agreement provided that the pace picks up considerably now.''
   The UAW has been irritated at Chrysler chief negotiator Anthony
St. John talking about contract proposals with the media before
describing them to the union. St. John said the company was
interested in an employee ownership plan for the company, forming a
multi-employer health-care trust to cut medical care costs and a
new way to figure profit sharing.
   UAW Vice President Stan Marshall, who's in charge of the
Chrysler Department, has said each of the proposals are as good as
dead.
   Tensions rose at GM earlier this month, when members of Local
659 at a Flint parts plant walked off their jobs for six days in a
local contract dispute.
   That strike, which affected production at seven assembly plants
and a variety of component factories, was unopposed by UAW national
leaders. It resulted in a contract guaranteeing the size of the
work force at the plant for years to come.
   The UAW has said job security is its top issue.

<HEAD>Air Fare Increases Slowed By Several Carriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pressure from competitors prompted several airlines Wednesday to
hold off fare increases, even though the price of jet fuel keeps
rising because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and
USAir all said Wednesday they would delay raising fares until Aug.
30.
   American's 5.3 percent fare increase originally was to have gone
into effect Thursday. American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, cited
competitive pressure for its delay, the third since fare hikes were
first announced Aug. 10.
   ``If one airline decides to do something different, they would
gain a competitive market position and other airlines simply cannot
allow that to happen,'' said American spokeswoman Mary O'Neill.
   Delta, based in Atlanta, first planned to raise fares on Aug.
15, and then this Thursday, but delayed the move to Aug. 30 in a
``competitive response'' to other airlines.
   Other major airlines have also responded to the Middle East
standoff by announcing a mixture of fare increases and discount
rates designed to lure more passengers.

<HEAD>Control Data: Export License Approved for Soviet Computer Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Commerce Department has granted
Control Data Corp. an export license to ship the most powerful
computers ever sent to the Soviet Union from the West, the company
said Tuesday.
   Control Data will ship six CYBER 960 mainframe computers worth a
total of $32 million to the Soviet Union beginning in September,
the company said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Control Data
during his June stop in Minnesota and viewed a demonstration of the
CYBER 960 computers. Gorbachev also spoke on the need for greater
technological and commercial cooperation between the United States
and the Soviet Union.
   The computers were ordered by the Soviet Research and
Development Institute of Power Engineering and will be used to
analyze safety factors in the operation of civilian Soviet nuclear
power reactors.
   The company applied for the export license last November and
announced the Soviet order on Dec. 12, 1989.
   Control Data worked with the U.S. Departments of Commerce,
State, Defense and Energy to put in place safeguards that the
computers will be dedicated to safety analysis of civilian nuclear
reactors, the company said.
   The Soviet Union's civilian nuclear power program is one of the
largest in the world with about 50 plants in operation, according
to a Control Data statement. Last year half of the Soviet Union's
nuclear-generated electricity was produced by plants designed by
the institute that has ordered the Control Data computers, the
company said.

who dial the Extra Fax number _ 222-XFAX _ to get more information
over their fax machines.
   It's all free of charge.
   The service had been used only for advertisements and allowed
readers to dial the fax number, put in the advertiser's code and
receive price lists, coupons or sales announcements.
   The new service provides figures for options and index options
traded on the Chicago, American, Philadelphia and Pacific exchanges.
   The service is the newspaper's first effort to expand its daily

information services.
   Jennewein said the system was developed by Marietta-based
