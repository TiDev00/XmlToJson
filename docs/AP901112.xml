   Just a minute, Karlyn Kohrs Campbell.
   Hold on there, Kathleen Hall Jamieson.
   What do you think you're doing?
   You set out to write a serious, scholarly, maybe
just-a-little-dull book about the crucial role that language plays
in the making of a successful presidency.
   You say you want to ``demonstrate rhetoric to be a fundamental,
constitutive element of the presidency.''
   That you've done.
   The University of Chicago Press published it.
   The title is ``Deeds Done in Words: Presidential Rhetoric and
the Genres of Governance.''
   It is full of arcane language and heavy thoughts.
   ``The special character of presidential inaugural addresses is
defined by these general epideictic features and by the nature of
the inauguration ceremony,'' you write.
   Stuff like that.
   You didn't set out to write, one would think, a feminist tract.
   But that you've done, too.
   You've dedicated your book: ``To the women who should have been
president; to the women who tried to be president; to the women who
will be president.''
   In footnote 12 to Chapter 4, you drop your bombshell. You've
read every State of the Union address ever delivered, and
discovered that in these speeches, women are invisible.
   ``Through 1966,'' you write, ``they are mentioned only twice,
once in relation to polygamy, by (Ulysses) Grant; once in relation
to suffrage, by (Woodrow) Wilson. More recently they have been
alluded to indirectly in Ronald Reagan's statements opposing
abortion.''
   And to drive home your point about the maleness of presidential
vision, you turn to a linguistic device. You use ``sic'' to show
that the words quoted are reproduced exactly as they appeared in
the original.
   You use ``sic'' to show that in their most formal rhetoric,
presidents have always talked about (and thought about) ``he'' when
they might have said (and thought about), ``he or she.''
   In this book, sic is a scythe.
   Look:
   -Quoting the Constitution: the president ``shall from time to
time give to the Congress information on the state of the Union and
recommend to their consideration such measures as he (sic) shall
judge necessary and expedient.''
   -Quoting George Washington: ``The magnitude and difficulty of
the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being
sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her
citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his (sic) qualifications,
could not but overwhelm with despondence one who ought to be
peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.''
   -Quoting Theodore Roosevelt: ``Our aim is to recognize what
Lincoln pointed out: The fact that there are some respects in which
men (sic) are obviously not equal ....''
   -Quoting Harry Truman: ``In all that we do we should remember
who we are and what we stand for. We are Americans. Our forefathers
(sic) had far greater obstacles than we have, and much poorer
chances of success.''
   -Quoting Lyndon Johnson: ``For our ultimate goal is a world
without war, a world made safe for diversity, in which all men
(sic), goods and ideas can freely move across every border and
every boundary.''
   What's up?
   In an interview, author Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School
of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, ducks.
   ``That's my co-author,'' says Ms. Jamieson. ``We let the senior
author do the stylistic stuff. If it had been up to me, I'd have
settled for a statement in the introduction. You can make the point
once. Your readers are smart enough.''
   So, senior author Campbell, professor of speech-communication at
the University of Minnesota, what are all these sics here for?
   ``As kind of a reminder to the audience about the very real male
character of political thinking in this country in the past. ... I
don't think of it as a feminist book, but I think of it as a book
that has some feminist sensibility.''
   So take note, Mister (sic) Presidents.

   A roofer fell off a roof onto a live
electrical line Monday, where he hung for 20 minutes until rescuers
could shut off the power and lower him to safety.
   Jack Robinson, a subcontractor for Roof Pro of Newberg near
Portland, accidentally touched a 13,000-volt power line with a
piece of sheet metal he was using to help roof a three-story
apartment building.
   The jolt knocked him from the roof, and he landed on his abdomen
on a 110-volt wire, about 30 feet above a sidewalk. He was
eventually removed by a fire crew using a cherry picker.
   ``By the grace of god I didn't hit the sidewalk,'' Jack Robinson
said from his bed in Emanuel Hospital and Health Center, where he
was being treated for burns to his hands and his thigh.
   ``The first few thoughts that went through my mind were my wife
and kids and my life insurance policy because I figured this was
it,'' he said.
   Portland Fire Bureau crews arrived within minutes, told Robinson
to hang on, and placed mattresses gathered from apartments on the
ground and held a safety net.
   Bureau spokesman Neil Heesacker said firefighters ``were
reluctant to put a ladder up to get him because the minute they
touched him they would ground him and probably electrocute him.''
   Portland General Electric shut off the power and dispatched a
picker, which firefighters used to rescue Robinson.
   Robinson's boss, Max Wright, said Robinson was working on a
ledge on the top of the roof when an 8-foot piece of sheet metal
Robinson was carrying touched the power line.
   ``As he fell, he landed on a wire down below - it kind of caught
him across the middle,'' Wright said. ``His legs were hanging on
one side and his torso was on the other.''
   Wright said Robinson managed to maintain a sense of humor about
the incident, even telling a co-worker, ``This is the way you don't
do it'' as he hung from the wire.

   Joel Chaiken changes diapers, cleans house and
is the chief caretaker of his toddler son. He does everything the
other mothers in his Bronx neighborhood do. His problem is he's not
a mother.
   That's why he was banned from a local mothers-infant group,
which deemed his male persona, non grata.
   Chaiken, 32, tried to join the Riverdale Neighborhood House
support group last October when his son, Benjamin, was 7 months
old.
   ``I thought basically it was a place to go during the day and
meet new people; a place to find out about baby care - to find out
real information, the kind your pediatrician can't give you - a
place for Benjamin to socialize and a place for support, to a
certain extent.''
   Instead, he found a closed door.
   Chaiken is trying to pry it open by filing what is believed to
be a precedent-setting discrimination suit. The state Division on
Human Rights recently decided Chaiken's case has merit and has
ordered a public hearing.
   ``We found enough reason to believe he was treated differently
because he was a man,'' said Felicia Clavell of the state agency.
   Some in Riverdale's upper-middle class neighborhood some 11
miles north of midtown Manhattan say that's the way it should be.
   ``There are mothers and there are dads and he's not a mother,''
said Caryl Malka, 33, boiling the argument down to basics.
   ``I would feel very uncomfortable talking about personal things
in front of him,'' the two-time mother and former group member
said. ``It's not a play group, it's not just about the semantics of
scheduling or diapering ... It's women getting together and talking
about very intimate things and a man joining the group would really
change that.''
   Chaiken agrees, but he doesn't think that's negative.
   ``I think it would change for the better. Once they learn a real
man could be understanding and compassionate, their own
relationships might change.''
   ``Women don't have a monopoly on emotional support and
compassion toward others,'' said Chaiken's wife, Sue Ellen Dodell,
who encouraged her husband to file the complaint.
   Gender equality is important to the couple. That's evident in
the surname they chose for their child. It isn't one name or the
other, or a hyphenated version but an equal combination of the two:
Chaidell.
   It's also evident in the Chaiken-Dodell-Chaidell family's
toy-strewn living room, littered with everything from a diapered
baby doll to pickup trucks.
   Chaiken said they decided ``at conception'' that he would give
up his $37,000-a-year engineering job to care for their child.
Dodell, 35, is a lawyer for the city.
   His wife suggested he join the group after seeing an
advertisement in a local paper inviting ``mothers with babies up to
1 year old'' to come and ``relax with a cup of coffee and enjoy
each other's company while they care for their babies.''
   The ad said topics included ``easing the transition into
parenthood, new routines, infants' sleeping and eating habits,
talking to your pediatrician and choosing child care.''
   Chaiken attended an open house and told social worker Etty
Bar-Shai, who runs the group, that he was interested in joining.
``She said it was full and that I should check again in January,''
Chaiken said.
   The center limits the group to 10 members; there were four in
the group the semester Chaiken applied.
   He said he continued asking questions about the group but ``I
got the feeling she was uncomfortable.''
   The next day, Chaiken's wife called to ask about joining and was
told, ``Sure there's spots open, why don't you come in for an
interview.'' When he confronted Ms. Bar-Shai, she told him the
group was only for mothers.
   As a woman, Dodell said, ``I understand some may feel
uncomfortable at first but I think they should just give him a
chance and see. I really think they could benefit from his
perspective.''
   But that, she said, is the emotional side of the issue.
   Legally, she believes, the center is plain wrong. ``It's a place
of public accommodation and Joel should be permitted in the group,
period.''
   Riverdale Neighborhood House is a nonprofit center that receives
city and state funding for a variety of educational and support
programs.
   The state Human Rights agency agrees and will argue Chaiken's
viewpoint at an as yet unscheduled hearing, Clavell said.
   ``They placed an ad and said, `Come one, come all, join us.' But
when Mr. Chaiken took them up on the offer, they said, `Oh no, you
have to be a woman.' When you invite the public that includes
men,'' Clavell said.
   Donald Cohn, a vice president at the center and an attorney at
the high-powered, Park Avenue law firm of Webster &amp; Sheffield,
insists there was no discrimination.
   ``He took advantage of other programs at Riverdale House and he
was invited to participate in other programs,'' Cohn said. ``This
one was just not appropriate for him.''
   After the hearing, an administrative law judge will make a
recommendation and State Commissioner of Human Rights Douglas White
will issue a final order. The case may take longer than a year to
resolve.
   Chaiken realizes the decision will come too late to benefit
Benjamin, who at 19 months old is already happily ensconced in a
toddlers group, albeit not at Neighborhood House. Chaiken said he
was allowed to join the toddler group at the center but was already
committed to a different program.
   ``So why are we fighting on? We're fighting on because this
issue really has to be resolved,'' said Chaiken. ``It's really to
help future fathers who stay at home so they won't have to go
through this battle,'' Dodell added.
   Besides, they said, the decision may come in time for child No.

<DATELINE>GORANDSI, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight years ago, a folk music group
from neighboring Greece came to this ethnic Greek village in
southern Albania. The audience waited hours in burning heat, but
neither smiled nor applauded.
   A witness said the people turned out to demonstrate ethnic
identity, but dared not show emotion in the Albania of Stalinist
dictator Enver Hoxha.
   Hoxha died in 1985 and, by Oct. 26, 1990, things had changed.
   Foreign Minister Antonis Samaris of Greece was welcomed like a
20th century messiah when he visited Gorandsi and nearby
Derviciani, another ethnic Greek settlement. Thousands of people
surged past uniformed and secret police simply to touch or smile at
him.
   Albania's Communist rulers have given hints of reform and are
gradually losing control of the 3.2 million citizens they repressed
for half a century.
   Startling evidence of the change came in July, when thousands of
Albanians sought refuge at foreign embassies in Tirana, the
capital, and were allowed to emigrate.
   Outside pressure has grown for improvements in human rights,
particularly from the 2 million ethnic Albanians in neighboring
Yugoslavia.
   If it wants to rejoin Europe, as it says, Albania must lift the
ban on religion imposed in 1967, allow free speech and honor its
promise, made before the mass emigration, of passports for all
wishing to travel abroad.
   An illustration of the Communist leadership's dilemma was the
Samaras visit to a minority Albania says numbers 80,000 and Greece,
by including all the Greek Orthodox faithful, puts at more than
400,000.
   Trucks blocked the road to Gorandsi. Samaras stopped his
motorcade and insisted on his scheduled visit to 1,000 people who
awaited him in the dusk.
   Men from the Sigurimi, the Albanian secret police, were
sprinkled liberally through the crowds in both villages.
   In Derviciani, a senior Albanian official threatened to expel a
Greek journalist who was handing out Greek-language books to
children.
   A woman identified by Greeks as Veronika Kallas, emboldened by
the rare presence of foreigners, defied secret police to slip a
visa request to a Greek journalist. She said her husband was in
jail for trying to flee Albania.
   ``It shows you have not forgotten us,'' an excited teen-ager
said as the crowd showed Samaras the former Greek Orthodox church
of Gorandsi, now a dilapidated storehouse with a faded cross etched
in the stone portal. Donkeys grazed in the yard.
   A woman gestured her eagerness to pray. Jars with burned-out wax
on window sills of the warehouse attested to continued reverence
for the church.
   Officials contend religion always was alien to Albanians, that
the Moslem, Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox faiths were imposed
by occupying outsiders over the centuries. Recently, however, the
authorities removed religion from a list of anti-state propaganda.
   After religion was outlawed, many churches and mosques became
storehouses or ruins. Only a few are preserved as historical
monuments.
   Albania was the only European nation not to sign the 1975
Helsinki agreements on European security and cooperation, which
include comprehensive human rights provisions.
   It now wants to join the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which resulted from the Helsinki accords.
   Albania may have little idea of what such membership entails. It
has isolated itself from the West for two generations, broke with
Moscow in 1968 and with China in 1976.
   ``I tell government officials that joining Helsinki means
non-government organizations have the right to come here and ask
`Why is this church or mosque closed?' and to get an answer,'' said
a foreign official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They
simply don't understand what that means.''
   Samaras' criticism of the host country's human rights record,
delivered at a conference of Balkan foreign ministers in Tirana,
was omitted from Albanian media reports.
   Officials were clearly unnerved by having to deal with the 105
foreign journalists allowed in for the conference, and gently urged
the last eight to leave to do so before their visas expired.
   Government secrecy makes it virtually impossible to verify
numerous rumors of human rights violations.
   Reports of border shootings or torture often arise in Greece or
Yugoslavia. Both have an interest in painting Albania darkly, the
Greeks because of their minority in the country and the Yugoslavs
because of the restive ethnic Albanian majority in Serbia's Kosovo
province.
   Kosovo's Albanians are far freer than citizens of Albania,
despite being stripped of provincial autonomy by Serbia. Hunger for
cross-border contacts is increasing, and hundreds of people a day
apply for visas at the Yugoslav consulate in Tirana.
   In May, acknowledging international pressure for the first time,
the Albanian leadership published figures indicating only 35
political prisoners were held.
   Aleks Lasuari, a Tirana University legal expert, told reporters
the death sentence is reserved only for severe crimes, and that
only three or four people are executed each year.
   How Deputy Foreign Minister Sokrat Plaka handled the Samaras
trip is an example of the government's quandary.
   First, he insisted to a reporter that those in the enthusiastic
crowd around the visitor were complaining that Greece was not
issuing enough visas. Minutes later, he pointed at the smiling
faces and said: ``You see, people are happy here in Albania.''

   A cruise ship recently embarked on its maiden
voyage with state-of-the-art garbage facilities and a promise by
passengers to be eco-friendly.
   It's all an effort to set a new standard for an industry
dependent on pristine waters.
   Anyone spotted tossing as much as a cigarette butt into the
waters of the South Pacific from the Frontier Spirit will be fined
$50, said Lars Wikander, president of Salen-Lindblad Cruising. The
ship sailed from Guam last week.
   ``Even biodegradable matter, such as food, will not be put
overboard when we're in ecologically delicate regions. We don't
want to disturb the feeding and breeding patterns of animal species
in these areas,'' Wikander said from his headquarters in New York.
   The $50 million, 164-passenger Frontier Spirit will freeze its
food and plastic waste, grind its glass to sand and burn the rest
through specially filtered incinerators, said Wikander, who
contends the ship establishes a new non-polluting standard for the
cruise industry.
   Salen-Lindblad can afford to install this technology - its
passengers tend to be well-off, tree-hugging environmentalists,
willing to pay a little more and follow strict rules in order to
see exotic locales.
   But even mainstream cruise lines pitching more affordable trips
to middle-class tourists on the well-traveled Caribbean circuit are
trying to make the most of the eco-tourism trend.
   ``People who pay for cruises are escaping to the beautiful
beaches and crystal-clear, deep blue waters you advertise in your
brochures. Dumping trash at sea, even though it's within the law,
doesn't fit this image,'' Coast Guard Cmdr. Darryle Waldron told an
international conference of cruise line officials in Miami last
week.
   International regulations forbid dumping of plastics anywhere in
the ocean, but glass, paper, metal and other garbage can legally be
tossed overboard 25 nautical miles from shore. Violators face up to
$25,000 in fines.
   The Coast Guard has investigated 57 allegations of illegal
dumping since the regulations took effect in May 1989, and many of
the charges are brought by cruise ship passengers, Waldron said.
   Once, 50 passengers signed a letter claiming they saw the crew
of their cruise ship dump bag after plastic bag over the side.
   ``It's very difficult for ship captains to deny that sort of a
complaint,'' said Waldron, who wouldn't identify the ship.
   Cargo vessels and weekend pleasure-boaters are responsible for
most of the ocean debris, Waldron said, but the cruise ships' image
still suffered when volunteers found more than 65 plastic cups and
shampoo bottles bearing their insignia in a Sept. 22 beach cleanup
of Florida beaches.
   Less than 100 items out of the more than 399,666 pounds of
garbage collected in the Center for Marine Conservation cleanup
doesn't seem like much, but the center's Gina Ruiz says cruise ship
trash remains troublesome.
   ``What washes up is only a very small sampling of what's
actually out there. It's a significant amount of garbage,'' Ruiz
said.
   Miami-based Carnival doesn't plan to fine anybody for throwing
trash overboard, but its passengers are encouraged to separate
plastics from glass, cans and paper into deck-side garbage cans.
   And on Royal Caribbean's newer ships, huge sewage treatment
systems and incinerators that burn at 900 degrees fahrenheit take
all the pollutants out of the waste released into the air and sea,
said spokesman Lloyd Axelrod.
   ``We're always looking at better ways to nurture the
ecosystem,'' said Axelrod. ``By the time we're finished with the
stuff, it's extremely clean. We feel that's very important.''

   Roses are red, violets are blue. But in
the Guadalupe Mountains, they can be yellow too.
   Folks in the Lone Star State may sing about the yellow roses,
but Monday they crowed about a small colony of yellow violets
discovered hanging from a cliff by a park ranger who had lost his
way.
   The rare flower, dubbed the Viola guadalupensis, or Guadalupe
Violet, is eligible for listing as a rare or endangered species,
said John Cook, National Park Service Southwest regional director.
   The plant was found March 22, 1987. It was verified as a species
in June and its discovery was announced Monday at a conference on
national parks attended by 350 federal officials, scientists and
wildlife preservationists.
   ``I was hiking up in the mountain alongside of a cliff and it
was very foggy,'' Guadalupe Mountains National Park ranger Brent
Wauer told a press conference at the gathering. ``I was a bit lost
and I noticed on the side of the cliff face a yellow plant that was
really not where it was supposed to be.
   ``There are no cliff plants in the park with yellow flowers,''
he said.
   ``I knew it was something unusual when I regained my balance, so
I went over and looked at it and it was a yellow violet,'' Wauer
said.
   The one small profusion of 35 individual plants with vibrant
yellow flowers grow in crevices on a limestone formation on the
east rim of the mountains.
   The 86,000-acre park is near the Texas-New Mexico line and about
100 miles east of El Paso.
   Wauer said two other species of violet can be found in the park,
but they follow the rhyme and are blue.
   Violets, despite their name, are known to come in hues other
than bluish-purple, including white and yellow.
   But this odd-ball violet appears to be a sturdy survivor of the
area's ancient rain forest. Half an inch in diameter with 6- to
12-inch stems, the flower is distinguished by the shape of its
leaves, its leaf hairs and its habitat in the pores of limestone.
   Wauer and a West Texas botanist believe most of the species
disappeared at least 8,000 years ago.
   These yellow violets aren't going to be sitting on window sills
anytime soon. The chances of increasing its population are slim.
   The violet was found on a steep, shaded cliff face in rugged
country of the wilderness park. The cliff measured 45 feet long and
30 feet high.
   Wauer and another person are the only people who know the
plant's precise location, a measure taken to protect it.
   ``To me this plant reflects a purity of nature that we
desperately need so that we can constantly go back to examine where
we're going,'' Wauer said. ``We seem to be at war with our planet
and if we win that war we'll lose.''

<HEAD>Germany's Sinking Job Market: Women with Children Fired First</HEAD>

   They sit on plastic chairs in a dimly lit
corridor, some cradling children, some reading books, all of them
killing time. Most are waiting for an answer they already know.
   Walk into any employment office in what used to be East Germany
and the women outnumber the men. They are losing their jobs at a
faster rate - and finding new ones far more slowly.
   They are not alone. Foreigners, young people, older people and
the handicapped are also finding it harder to find or keep jobs in
a quickly sinking economy, experts say.
   The former nation's job market has become a Darwinian proving
ground, a battle for survival in which people in the most fragile
financial and social situations are the first to be fired.
   ``A method of dismissals is at work that is distinguished solely
by its mercilessness,'' said Ulrike Peretzki-Leid, a board member
and social expert for Germany's Public Service, Transportation and
Traffic Union.
   Employment experts say former state-run businesses, desperate to
survive the painful transition from a socialist state to a market
economy, are getting rid of the workers they believe are most
likely to hold them back.
   Women of childbearing age - particularly single women with small
children - are the most vulnerable because of traditionally high
rates of absenteeism to care for children.
   ``Women are the first to be given their notice, and the last to
be hired,'' said Peretzki-Leid.
   At Berlin's main jobless office, in the former headquarters of
the Communist secret police, women outnumbered men at least 5-to-1
on a recent day. About 60 people crowded the long corridor, some
waiting four hours for their names to be called.
   ``I've been looking for work since February,'' said Eve-Marie
Schmidt, 35, a former saleswoman at a clothing store.
   Ms. Schmidt, who is divorced, has a 12-year-old son at home and
draws about $400 a month in unemployment.
   ``For women like me, the situation is terrible,'' she said.
   Karin Wernecke, who has a degree in political science from the
old Communist school system, worked as a prison counselor but has
been looking for work since March.
   ``I've tried to get job training for factories, for computers,
even to work as a hairdresser, but I can't even get into a training
program,'' she said. ``My last chance will be to try to get a job
as a cleaning woman in West Berlin.''
   Mrs. Wernecke, 30, said her husband left her this year. She has
an 8-year-old son at home and lives on $330 a month in unemployment
benefits.
   Kirsten Sell, a caseworker at one of several eastern Berlin
social services offices, says she handled 1,227 new welfare cases
alone in October, about half of them single, unemployed women with
children.
   According to government statistics, 90 percent of the women in
what used to be East Germany held jobs, compared to about 50
percent in the former West Germany.
   Although they comprised nearly 49 percent of the 8.4
million-member work force, women made up 54.2 percent of the
537,799 jobless last month.
   Nationwide, another 6 percent of the unemployed were under the
age of 20, 1.9 percent were handicapped and 6.6 percent were
part-time workers, many of them believed to be women.
   That means only 31.3 percent of the jobless were able-bodied
males over the age of 20.
   Klaus Grehn, president of the Unemployment Society, an activist
group representing eastern Germany's jobless, says the
organization's own research shows that only about 25 percent of the
relatively few new hires in the region are being filled by women.
   He also said dismissals are disproportionately high for younger
workers, who are usually the least experienced, and handicapped and
older workers.
   Gabriela Endert-Reinhart, spokeswoman for the central employment
office in Berlin, said jobless information in the former East
Germany is compiled by hand and that no statistical breakdowns are
available to back up those claims.
   But she said the available information does indicate that women
are being laid off at a faster rate.
   ``An enterprise has a male mechanic and women mechanic and one
must be fired. Naturally, a woman with a child is going to be the
one fired,'' she said.
   Even though East Germany was a Communist police state, the high
employment among women was credited to the remarkable social
benefits they were given.
   Women were guaranteed 20 weeks paid maternity leave, single
parents got four weeks paid leave and unlimited unpaid leave to
take care of sickchildren.
   There also have been widespread reports of soaring unemployment
among the former nation's foreign work force.
   Lien Nguyen Phuong, who came to East Germany three years ago,
said she was among the entire 110-member Vietnamese work force
fired on Nov. 1 at a textile factory in Dresden.
   She said she wants to remain in Germany, but has to find work
within a year.
   ``It's difficult enough being Vietnamese, but a Vietnamese and a
woman ...'' she said. ``At least I don't have children.''

<HEAD>Reagan Lists FDR Among His Heroes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan has always said he's a sucker
for heroes. One of the heroes who influenced him the most, he says,
is Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   Reagan, who often made much of his admiration for the
conservative Calvin Coolidge, has much more to say of the
trailblazing Roosevelt in his new autobiography, ``An American
Life.''
   The 40th president, often pictured as an opponent of the kind of
active government that the 32nd president brought to Washington,
argues that he was really aiming at Lyndon Johnson, not FDR.
   He quotes Roosevelt in support of his free trade views, says he
borrowed Roosevelt's idea of ``fireside chats'' to the people, and
agrees with him on the need for compromise in dealing with
legislators.
   He also says he believes Roosevelt never intended for some of
the New Deal programs, such as relief or welfare, to become
permanent.
   Reagan's linking of himself with FDR gets some support, with
reservations, from presidential scholars.
   ``This is not Franklin Delano Reagan, although he would very
much like to be,'' said Roosevelt biographer Frank Freidel.
   Some of Reagan's observations are ``possibly right,'' Freidel
said in a telephone interview, adding, ``I have the feeling that
Roosevelt himself was a good bit more conservative than his enemies
make him out to be.''
   ``I think these are all thoughts of hindsight on the part of
Reagan, however,'' Freidel said. ``Certainly the way he was
campaigning for Goldwater in 1964 was not in the spirit of FDR and
the New Deal.''
   Richard Neustadt, in the new edition of his classic study,
``Presidential Power,'' described Reagan as ``the last Roosevelt
Democrat we shall see as president.''
   ``Reagan's links to Roosevelt were important for his
presidency,'' Neustadt wrote. ``FDR in 1933 had changed the
country's consciousness of what its government should be and do.
Reagan aspired to no less, if in the opposite direction.''
   Reagan wastes no time bringing up Roosevelt in his book. On the
first page of the first chapter, he quotes his words that ``the
country was dying by inches'' in the Depression. By page 66, he is
saying, ``I soon idolized FDR.''
   Altogether, there are 17 entries for Roosevelt in the index. For
Coolidge, whose picture Reagan hung in the White House Cabinet
Room, there are two.
   He writes that when he became governor of California some of his
conservative backers did not want him to compromise with the
Legislature, but he agreed with Roosevelt, who said in 1933, ``I
have no expectations of making a hit every time I come to bat. What
I seek is the highest possible batting average.''
   When the Democratic Legislature balked at his programs, he says,
he decided to appeal over their heads by going on radio and
television. ``Franklin D. Roosevelt gave me the idea with his
Fireside Chats, which made an indelible mark on me during the
Depression ... It worked better than I ever dreamed it would.''
   Later, facing opposition in Congress as president, he writes,
``That meant I had to dip into FDR's bag of tricks and take my case
to the people.''
   The former president says the late Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.
``often told me that his father had said many times his welfare and
relief programs during the Depression were meant only as emergency,
stopgap measures to cope with a crisis, not the seeds of what
others later tried to turn into a permanent welfare state.''
   In a 1982 diary entry that he quotes, Reagan wrote, ``the press
is trying to paint me as now trying to undo the New Deal. I remind
them I voted for FDR four times. I'm trying to undo the `Great
Society.' It was LBJ's war on poverty that led us to our present
mess.''
   Nevertheless, he also says that in the 1930s the Democratic
party ``began to change drastically'' as its leaders began
``creating a government that grew ever larger and increasingly
demanded the right to regulate and plan the social and economic
life of the country and move into areas best left to private
enterprise.''
   One of the links between Reagan and Roosevelt, Neustadt said,
was ``Reagan's image of office.''
   Freidel said, ``It's just that his whole youth was one of
thinking that Roosevelt was quite wonderful and then in later years
turning toward more conservative matters ... and still not wanting
to get rid of this wonderful symbol, this man who meant so much to
him in his youth.''
   But, said Roosevelt's biographer, ``He is not as much like FDR
as he thinks he is. He is like FDR in that he has charm and
persuasiveness in conversation and is full of good anecdotes and
has enormous political skill.
   ``On the other hand, Roosevelt worried frightfully about the
people who were out of work, who were dispossessed and homeless,
and did what he could for them. In areas like this, certainly the
Roosevelt image is rather different from the Reagan image: Years of
prosperity, and his rather lack of concern about those at the
bottom of the pile.''
   Former Speaker of the House Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. seems to have
told Reagan much the same thing.
   After a telephone conversation with O'Neill in 1982, the
president wrote in his diary, ``Tip is truly a New Deal liberal. He
honestly believes that we're promoting welfare for the rich.''

<HEAD>California a `Bigger Enchilada' in Presidential Races; Texas,
Florida, Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next time the nation picks a president,
the ``big enchilada'' of politics - California - will be even
bigger.
   Florida and Texas are gaining more stature too, as U.S. House
seats shift to the Sun Belt and bring with them more of the
electoral votes that decide who wins the White House.
   The seats will shift when new congressional districts are drawn
next year to reflect the population shifts detected in the 1990
Census.
   In 1992, California, Florida and Texas will carry a combined 111
electoral votes - 14 more than they did in 1988. That's 41 percent
of the 270 needed to win the presidency.
   California alone will have gained seven electoral votes, giving
it 54 - 20 percent of the victory threshold.
   ``It's pretty hard to see how you're going to win if you don't
carry California,'' said GOP consultant John Sears, a top official
in the 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan.
``It's as close as you can be to a situation where you've just got
to have it now. We've never had anything this big to contend
with.''
   The new math of the Electoral College means that the 1992
candidates will be spending more time and money in California. And
with Florida and Texas also drawing more interest, smaller states
not vital to a candidate's electoral puzzle likely will get far
less attention.
   ``Obviously it skews it even more from what it used to be, and a
result will be ignoring more states,'' said Lyn Nofziger, who ran
the White House political operation for Reagan. ``You're going to
have to focus heavily on those three states.''
   President Bush won all three in 1988, as did Reagan in both of
his winning campaigns. So the shift bodes well for Republicans,
even more so because the electoral votes going to areas of GOP
strength are coming from the Northeast and Midwest, the Democratic
Party's traditional base.
   New York, for example, was the biggest prize with 45 electoral
votes when John F. Kennedy was elected in 1960; 41 when Jimmy
Carter won in 1976. It was down to 36 for the 1984 and 1988
elections and will drop again to 33 in 1992.
   The 1992 shifts will transfer 19 electoral votes in all, mostly
from the Northeast and Midwest to the Sun Belt. California is
expected to get seven, Florida four and Texas three. New York will
lose three; Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois will each
lose two.
   ``This continuing trend is one of the big reasons Republicans
have been strong at the presidential level,'' said Sears.
   Democratic victories in the Florida and Texas gubernatorial
races and a gain of two House seats in the South in last week's
elections had the party boasting that it had blunted the so-called
Republican realignment in the South.
   ``Realignment is a myth,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas,
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
``Realignment is dead.''
   But the Democratic wins in Florida and Texas had at least as
much to do with the shortcomings of the Republican candidates as
with the popularity of the winners, and don't automatically
translate into a boost for the Democratic presidential nominee in
two years, analysts say.
   ``When the whole Republican trend in the South was developed in
the early '60s there were Democratic governors in these states and
it didn't make any difference,'' said Kevin Phillips, the
Republican analyst who first envisioned a successful Southern
strategy for national GOP candidates. ``The state voting patterns
don't mirror the national patterns.''
   Phillips said Texas and Florida would prove difficult for a
Democratic nominee to win, ``assuming of course a northern liberal
nominee.'' California, on the other hand, ``is probably a shade
more liberal than the rest of the country,'' he said, so it could
be an easier trophy for a Democrat to win.
   Sears concurred.
   ``If I were the Democrats, I'd concentrate on holding the
Northeast and winning the bigger states of the Middle West and then
taking California,'' he said.

   Emperor Akihito formally assumed the Chrysanthemum
Throne on Monday in rites steeped in ancient tradition but
reflecting the U.S.-imposed postwar constitution that denies him
the divine status of his predecessors.
   Despite massive security precautions, leftist extremists opposed
to the monarchy launched attacks on military bases, train stations
and Shinto shrines as the late Emperor Hirohito's son assumed the
throne, which is said to date from 660 B.C.
   Police counted more than 32 guerrilla incidents Monday morning,
most in Tokyo. None of the attacks appeared to cause injuries, but
they disrupted several train lines, and a bomb exploded near a
police dormitory, setting two empty houses on fire, police said.
   Akihito, wearing a red-brown silk kimono of ancient design, sat
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an Imperial Palace
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords.
   He vowed to uphold Japan's modern constitution, which
fundamentally restructures the world's oldest hereditary monarchy.
   ``On this occasion, I pledge anew that I shall observe the
constitution of Japan and discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people,'' Akihito, speaking in
colloquial Japanese, told about 2,500 guests in the heavily guarded
palace.
   Seated on her own throne at Akihito's side was Empress Michiko,
also dressed in full imperial regalia.
   Under the cloudless skies, gong and drum attendants played
haunting court music for royal family, officials and guests.
Dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included Vice
President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles and Princess
Diana.
   Akihito expressed deep ``love and respect'' for his father, who
died in January 1989 after a 62-year reign that encompassed Japan's
crushing defeat in World War II and spectacular rise as the world's
No. 2 economic power.
   Hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war. Under
the new constitution, Akihito becomes the first of Japan's 125
emperors, including those listed only in legend, to take the throne
as a mere mortal and not a priest-king.
   The ceremony ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, wearing a
morning suit instead of traditional garb, leading the Japanese
guests in three cries of ``banzai!'' - a wish for long life.
   He led the cheers from a spot level with the throne to
underscore the constitution's emphasis on popular sovereignty.
   Earlier Monday, Akihito had announced his ascension to the sun
goddess and his ancestors in private prayers at wooden shrines
inside the palace.
   A blimp floated overhead with a huge sign urging Tokyo residents
to call with any information about suspected terrorist activity.
   Following the enthronement, Akihito and Empress Michiko were to
change into Western clothes and travel in an open car to the
Akasaka Palace, three miles away. Officials said nearly 10,000
police would line the route, which passes in front of Japan's
parliament.
   But many Japanese were ignoring the ceremonies, taking advantage
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses
and driving ranges. One poll indicated nearly half of the Japanese
were not interested in the enthronement.
   A record 37,000 police, many dressed in full riot gear and
backed by water cannon, were deployed in Tokyo to guard the
ceremonies but could not stop a series of attacks throughout the
city.
   Radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases
and a fourth in western Tokyo, the Defense Agency reported. Police
reported a similar attack outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi, 25
miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at
three Tokyo train stations that stopped traffic on two major
commuter lines, police reported.
   Fires erupted at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including one
less than a mile from Akihito's residence, destroying two.
   Radicals and other critics say the coronation and its
accompanying rites are based too closely on the traditional
religious rituals used for Akihito's father, whose name was invoked
by the militarists who launched the Pacific War.
   Opponents say state funding of the ceremonies, linked to Japan's
indigenous Shinto religion, violates the constitutional separation
of religion and state.
   Akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father,
but a period of mourning was observed before his enthronement.
   As with Hirohito's funeral, which was attended by
representatives of 164 nations, the enthronement provided
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings. Kaifu was
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials.
   The government is reportedly spending $95 million on the rites,
much of it for security.
   Akihito, 56, was tutored after World War II by an American
pacifist, and is the first emperor in modern Japanese history to
marry a commoner.
   He and the empress also raised their three children themselves,
rather than have them raised separately by aides, as was the
imperial custom.

<HEAD>GAO Study Says Voting Should be Easier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the heels of the lowest election turnout in
50 years comes a study that says it's wrong to blame voter
alienation. Make the process easier, says the report, and more
Americans will cast ballots.
   ``Election procedures in the United States make voting
cumbersome,'' the General Accounting Office tells Congress.
   Its remedies: Set registration deadlines to fall on or close to
Election Day; establish toll-free numbers for absentee ballot
requests; allow voting by mail.
   Last Tuesday's turnout is estimated to have matched that of
1986, which was the lowest in nearly half a century.
   In another report, not connected with the pre-election GAO
study, analyst Curtis Gans said 26 states and the District of
Columbia had increased voter participation but that only 36.4
percent of those eligible to vote nationwide actually did.
   The United States ranks 20th among 21 democracies in turnout for
national elections, with only Switzerland doing worse.
   Italy led the pack with a 94 percent turnout, followed by
Austria with 89.3 percent and Belgium with 89.7 percent.
   In the 1980 general election in the United States, only 52.6
percent voted.
   ``A popular explanation of our low and still declining voter
turnout is that, unlike citizens of other democracies, Americans
have become alienated from the political process,'' the report
says. ``This argument assumes that Americans increasingly believe
that politicians cannot be trusted and that the government is
unresponsive, ineffectual, or even corrupt.''
   Sometimes, too, the alienation is attributed to the Vietnam war
and the Watergate scandal.
   It's a plausible explanation, but not supported by research,
says GAO.
   ``Interest in politics, attention to political affairs in the
media and individual political efficacy is consistently higher in
the United States than in the European democracies,'' the report
says.
   There seems to be no connection between voter turnout and trust
in government.
   Only 14 percent of Italians trust their government, the report
says, but their voter turnout is the highest. The American level of
trust in government is 34 percent, compared with 76 percent of the
Swiss and 55 percent of Austrians.
   Europeans vote in greater numbers because national parties in
some countries are closely linked with specific economic, religious
and other demographic categories, in contrast to more diffuse,
crosscutting linkages in the United States. That allows political
parties to develop platforms representing the specific interests of
groups.
   Another powerful incentive to voting exists in Austria, Belgium
and Venezuela, which impose fines or other penalties for failure to
vote.
   In Italy, the nonvoter may have his name posted outside the town
hall, GAO says, and his identification papers may be stamped: ``Did
not vote for five years.''
   GAO says automatic voter registration, common elsewhere, might
do wonders in the United States. In some countries, voters register
when they renew their drivers' licenses.
   The Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, directed
by Gans, said the motor-voter registration, adopted in 12 states
since the 1986 election, seems to be a success. In 10 of the 12
states, turnout was higher.
   GAO said as many as 37 states could increase their turnout by
five or more percentage points by adopting Election Day
registration.
   Arizona, which requires registration at least 50 days before
election, could increase turnout by as much as 12.5 percentage
points, the report said.
   As for mail voting, the GAO said it's logical to assume that
would increase turnout without a major increase in fraud.
   ``We found that all-mail-ballot elections in selected elections
led to a 20 to 40 percentage point increase in turnout, with a cost
that was at least 32 percent lower on a per ballot basis than the
cost of conducting conventional polling-place elections,'' GAO
said.

<TEXT>
   Voters in the states of Hidalgo and Mexico
cast ballots Sunday for state assemblies and mayors of more than
200 cities and towns in a key test for the long-governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   The party of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari now controls
all but a few municipalities in the two states.
   Governing party officials told reporters shortly after polls
closed that they appeared to be ahead in nearly all 121 towns in
Mexico state, the country's largest.
   Earlier, they had told reporters privately that they feared
losing in at least a handful of towns.
   Opposition party leaders claimed they would make massive gains,
but turnout was low and that could benefit the governing party.
   In many voting stations, reporters found no one at all waiting
to drop ballots into the transparent boxes. And despite opposition
charges of fraud, most polling stations appeared orderly.
   The most optimistic predictions called for no more than a 35
percent turnout among 4.5 million registered voters in the state of
Mexico, which borders but does not include Mexico City.
   Opposition parties claimed that supporters of the governing
party had stolen voting boxes, organized caravans of multiple
voters and interfered with poll watchers. Charges of fraud are
common in Mexican elections.
   The Mexico state election commission said it had received
complaints about incidents involving 84 voting places, 2.3 percent
of the total. But election commissions in both states reported the
voting was generally peaceful.
   Eight parties fielded candidates in Mexico state and seven in
neighboring Hidalgo. But only the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the conservative National Action Party and the leftist Party
of the Democratic Revolution were given much chance to score
victories.
   The results were not to be verified for a week.
   The state of Mexico is the wealthiest of the country's 31
states. About 80 percent of the 10 million residents live in urban
areas around the sprawling federal district of Mexico City.
   The state includes everything from opulent and middle-class
suburbs to areas such as Chalco and Nezahualcoyotl where millions
of rural newcomers live in unspeakable squalor without water or
electricity.
   The governing party, known as the PRI from its Spanish initials,
hoped to benefit in the election from recent construction of roads,
water systems and other services.
   Hidalgo is a mountainous, rural state with many small villages.
The 914,041 registered voters there were electing officials in 84
municipalities.
   While the governing party retains its 61-year-old control of
nearly all aspects of Mexican politics, its monopoly on power has
eroded gradually in some regions.
   Voters in Mexico City, whose mayor is appointed rather than
elected, voted heavily against Salinas in the 1988 presidential
elections, which he won by the most narrow margin in the PRI's
history.
   National Action was expected to show strength in the large urban
areas around the capital, while Democratic Revolution might win in
some of the small farming areas near Michoacan state, home of its
founder Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
   Cardenas asked for a postponement of the election, saying the
PRI had rigged the voter rolls and was preparing a ``cybernetic
fraud'' with computers.
   Electoral officials dismissed the charges, saying Cardenas had
time to make them earlier through the state electoral board.
   The PRI has been known to resort to fraud and strong-arm tactics
to win elections. Under Salinas, however, the party has instituted
internal reforms and promised to abide by the voters' will.
   The reforms included state primary elections to choose local
candidates, doing away with the appointment of candidates by party
leaders.

   An Agriculture Department toll-free hotline is
doing a brisk business handing out tips on what kind of goodies to
send the troops in the Persian Gulf area.
   Hotline supervisor Sue Templin said it has received more than
350 calls about sending food to American military personnel since
the special service was announced Nov. 1.
   ``We had a day care center call,'' she said. ``The children had
decided they had gotten too much Halloween candy, and they were
going to send some.''
   Just the hard candy and the candy-coated gum should be sent, the
kids were told. Chocolate melts too easily.
   One woman caller had a group of cub scouts in her kitchen,
making those ever-popular crispy squares out of puffed rice,
marshmallows and butter or margarine as gulf munchies.
   Templin said those are less fragile than some items but have a
high moisture content. They're worth the gamble, she said.
   About 230,000 U.S. troops are in the area now, and President
Bush said last week as many as 200,000 more will be going soon as
part of the massive buildup against Iraqi forces.
   Templin expects families and friends of those additional U.S.
troops will help keep hotline operations humming.
   Home folks want to send favorite foods and treats to those in
the gulf but often aren't sure what will survive the long trip and
the temperatures. That's where Templin's crew comes in.
   Calls are answered during regular working hours by a team of
home economists and dietitians. Typically, the callers are ``just
looking for suggestions about what is good to send, and to get an
idea on what not to send,'' Templin said in an interview.
   Sometimes the advice on what not to send is too late.
   ``In fact, we've talked to people who've told us they've sent
things, that their servicemen have already gotten them and eaten
them,'' she said. ``One woman said she sent sausages and cheese
balls. I don't know how she packed them, but he got them and ate
them.''
   The hotline crew worked with USDA food scientists, military
experts and the U.S. Postal Service on a list of do's and don'ts.
   Food items that spoil easily should be avoided, particularly
high-moisture baked goods susceptible to mold. Pork and pork
products are taboo, along with alcohol, because those are banned in
Saudi Arabia for religious reasons.
   ``One person was dismayed that we had said not to send
chocolate, because that's what their person (in the gulf) loved,''
Templin said. But that was after ``the M&amp;Ms made it over in good
condition.''
   Templin said air mail service may be getting some of the
vulnerable items to the gulf quickly enough to prevent meltdown or
other damage.
   ``A number of people have asked about (sending) smoked turkeys
because they think that they would be safe'' to eat, she said.
``But they're not. This is a common misconception people have, even
in mailing turkeys in this country.''
   Canned meats and poultry or tuna are safe from food poisoning
organisms, although recipients should avoid the contents of swollen
or damaged cans. That can be a sign of harmful bacteria.
   ``Mostly, they want to send baked goods,'' Templin said. ``From
talking to people in the military, the troops are being well-fed,
so what they're looking for are treats.''
   Naturally, the young man or woman in the gulf would like a
favorite cake or cookies, brownies and similar home-baked items.
But callers are told to send cakes in tins, and to bake the harder,
drier kind.
   The hotline has been operated for the past five years by the
department's Food Safety and Inspection Service for callers who
want to ask all sorts of questions about what they eat. In the
fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, more than 80,000 calls were logged
electronically.
   Only about half of those were answered personally by hotline
staffers, Templin said. The rest were at night or on weekends when
taped messages were available.
   Many calls relate to USDA announcements of recall actions and
recommendations for consumers who have those products.
   The USDA toll-free hotline number on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. EST is 1-800-535-4555. Residents in the Washington, D.C., area
should call 202 447-3333.

<HEAD>Study: Pay Cuts Boost Pilfering By Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers may well respond to pay cuts by stealing
company property, eroding at least part of the cost savings their
bosses sought, a new study says.
   Employee thefts more than doubled at a manufacturing plant when
a 15 percent pay cut was imposed, and fell back to normal when full
wages were restored, the study found.
   An identical pay cut at a comparable plant caused less of an
increase in pilfering because management explained its reasons
fully and sensitively, researcher Jerald Greenberg said.
   ``You can make people less likely to hurt the company by ...
explaining to them in a socially sensitive anner, and a highly
informative manner, why it was necessary for them to suffer this
inequity,'' said Greenberg, a professor of management and human
resources at Ohio State University.
   The study focused on nonunion factory workers, largely
semiskilled and unskilled. It would take further research to know
if its conclusions apply to other kinds of employees, but ``there's
good theoretical reason to believe that it probably would,''
Greenberg said.
   Another expert in worker psychology said he was skeptical about
its applicability to white collar workers, skilled blue collar
workers and professionals. They might just find jobs elsewhere
instead of stealing, said Kenneth De Meuse of the University of
Wisconsin in Eau Claire.
   Greenberg presents the results of his study in the October issue
of the Journal of Applied Psychology. He said it is not clear
whether the extra pilfering is aimed at making up for lost income
or getting revenge.
   The study included three Midwestern manufacturing plants owned
by the same company. The plants make small mechanical parts, mostly
for the aerospace and automotive industries.
   Greenberg designated them Plants A, B and C. Before the pay cut,
Plant A employed 64 workers, Plant B 53 workers and Plant C 66. The
study lasted for 30 weeks, centered on the 10-week pay cut.
   Employee theft was measured by an accounting formula that
revealed percentage of inventory, such as tools and supplies, that
was missing for no other known reason.
   At Plant A, employees were told by the company president that
pay would be reduced by 15 percent for 10 weeks. During the
90-minute meeting, the decision was fully explained with charts and
graphs, the president expressed serious regret and said everybody
would share in the pay cuts, with no favoritism.
   He spent nearly an hour answering questions.
   At Plant B, the pay cut was explained tersely by a vice
president in a 15-minute meeting. No expressions of apology or
remorse were shared, the reason for the decision was not clearly
described, and the vice president said he could answer only one or
two questions before catching a plane.
   At this plant, the percentage of inventory apparently stolen
jumped from about 3 percent before the pay cut to about 8 percent
during the pay cut. It returned to about 3 percent after wages were
restored.
   Plant A went from about 3 percent to 5 percent, and fell back to
3 percent again.
   At Plant C, which did not have any pay cut, the rate remained at
about 3 percent through the 30 weeks.
   Greenberg said the company did not tell him what was stolen nor
give a dollar value.
   De Meuse noted that at Plant B, at which a poor explanation was
given, also had a large jump in resignations during the pay cut,
while Plant A was unaffected. That shows that good explanations can
also reduce turnover from a pay cut, he said.

<HEAD>Majority Leader Mitchell: Too Soon for Nostalgia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few weeks ago, Senate Democratic leader
George Mitchell feared that those were the halcyon days, that the
voters would cut into the 55-45 majority he commanded for two years
in battle with President Bush.
   He boasted frequently about the accomplishments of the
just-ending Congress. He was almost nostalgic, as if time already
had prematurely dimmed its many shortcomings.
   But after last week's elections, Mitchell had the calm of
someone who'd won the lottery, paid off the mortgage and now could
do what he really wanted to do. He spoke mainly of the future, not
the past.
   ``I think there's a movement our way,'' he said, quietly
chatting in his Capitol office overlooking Washington's monuments
and the White House.
   It's said to be the second-best view in Washington - the best
being the one that looks back from the other end of Pennsylvania
Avenue.
   Mitchell took over as Senate majority leader two years ago after
winning a tough three-way race for the support of his Democratic
colleagues.
   He then had to fight out from the shadow of his predecessor,
Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who stayed on in the Senate
as chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee.
   Mitchell had to fight the president on the minimum wage, on the
capital gains tax, on aid to China, on the civil rights bill, on
clean air, on parental leave.
   He fought in endless hours on the Senate floor, and packed in
more press conferences and television appearances than any of his
predecessors.
   In some cases he managed just a draw, and never did the
Democratic Congress overpower a Bush veto.
   But at the end, after a brutal showdown on taxes, Bush began to
look weak, and the Democrats stronger. Then, in last week's
election, the Democrats managed to snatch a Senate seat away from
the Republicans despite vigorous campaigning around the country by
the president.
   When Mitchell first became majority leader, his reputation was
as a scholarly, judicial (he's a former judge) but partisan
lawmaker. Now, one must add cunning to the list.
   ``I think after feeling his way he ended up with a pretty good
first Congress,'' said Stephen Hess, a scholar at the Brookings
Institution who has written about Congress and how it is portrayed
in the news media. ``He's in about as good a position as he can
be.''
   On Tuesday, Mitchell will be re-elected Senate majority leader,
with no opposition. He now is confident enough in the job that
he'll be delegating some of the work of running the Senate to
others.
   ``I've always worked hard, but I've never been through anything
like the last two years,'' he said. ``I intend obviously to work
hard at it but I don't intend to keep up that pace.''
   For nine years, including the last two, Mitchell's top objective
was passage of a new clean air bill. Now that's done, and he
intends to concentrate his attention on health care issues,
including long-term care for the elderly.
   He's prepared for those issues to take as long as clean air did.
And he doesn't intend to be any more single-minded about health
care than he was about clean air.
   Mitchell scored his biggest points for his handling of the
debate over taxes. Democrats stalled and stalled until the debate
moved from whether to raise taxes at all to which tax increases
were most fair to the middle class. Along the way, Bush got labeled
as the rich man's president.
   The Democrats intend to keep that debate going.
   ``Well, I saw in the paper today the president will renew his
push for a capital gains cut. That raises the issue right there,''
said Mitchell, borrowing one of those ``make my day'' grins that
President Reagan used to wear.
   Despite his expanded majority and consolidated power, including
a firmer grip on the Senate's arcane bureaucracy, Mitchell's life
in the 102nd Congress won't be a cakewalk. First among the
complicating factors will be the several senators of his party who
will be running for president.
   What about Mitchell? How'd he like to trade the second-best view
for the best?
   He laughs, protesting nearly too much. ``No. Thank you for
asking. I'm grateful for those who ask.''

   Ravel's only two operas, ``A Spanish Hour'' and
``The Bewitched Child,'' should delight both adult and child as
performed by the New York City Opera, with sets by children's
author Maurice Sendak.
   The works began a run of 10 shows Saturday at the New York State
Theater, performed in French with English subtitles.
   ``A Spanish Hour'' had its Opera-Comique premiere delayed from
1907 to 1911 because of its risque nature. Now, it looks like
farcical fun.
   The stage features what looks like a moving clock from a
European town square. A rooster nods, a hat bobs, three real people
move mechanically, like clock figures.
   The clockmaker's wife, sung by soprano Kathryn Gamberoni, is
visited by two lovers, a silly poet (Michael Rees Davis) and a
pompous mayor (Jan Opalach). To keep a mule driver, a customer in
the clock shop, from realizing they're there, the woman puts her
lovers into grandfather clocks and has the strong young muleteer
carrying those clocks in and out of her bedroom.
   ``The Bewitched Child'' is based on a short play about a naughty
little girl. Ravel changed it to a boy sung by a soprano, in this
case Robin Tabachnik.
   A garden, looking like something from Sendak's ``Where the Wild
Things Are,'' glides across the stage before the child's room is
seen.
   The child shows his bad temper by proclaiming, ``I want to chop
off the squirrel's tail. I want to growl at everyone,'' and
throwing his book out the window.
   Projected flames dance. Projected numbers enter, jump around and
pile up so cunningly that the audience applauded.
   A princess, sung in a sweet, clear, small soprano by Young Ok
Shin, complains that the child tore up her story, what will happen
to her now?
   The stage becomes a forest, lighted like a dream. Trees move in
and out over steam. Animals and insects appear. At the end, the
child binds a wounded paw and the animals forgive him and let him
go home.
   Frank Corsaro directed the productions.
   Guido Ajmone-Marsan was called in to conduct after conductor
Pierre Dervaux became ill.

   When Wall Street goes bust, they walk on Easy
Street. When recession hits, their business booms.
   They are repossessors and auctioneers, scavengers of bad times
who clean up the fiscal wreckage when the economy breaks down.
   ``This is the boom time for us, definitely,'' said Evan Gabriel,
an auctioneer in Canton. ``It's a real big opportunity.''
   And they have the 1980s to thank for their success. Then,
companies and people borrowed freely from banks to buy and build.
   Then came the crash. In New England, the sore spot of the
nation's economy, scores of banks were left with piles of bad
loans.
   Enter the banks' foot soldiers - repo men and auctioneers.
   The repo men take back cars and boats, among other things, when
their owners no longer can make payments. The auctioneers sell off
houses and other things the banks foreclose on.
   ``I don't like to say there's a lot more business. There's
enough bad news in the economy. We don't need to make it worse, you
know what I mean?'' said Ron Bethel, who repossesses boats in
Mendon. ``But there's more than a moderate increase.''
   The repo man's stock in trade is expensive cars. Sometimes,
though, the booty is bigger.
   Jack Barnes, executive director of National Finance Adjusters,
an association of repossessors, once claimed a herd of 74 horses in
Oklahoma. Another time, he repossessed a helicopter and flew it to
Florida.
   ``We've done oil drilling equipment, all sorts of things,'' said
Barnes, who runs his own repo firm in Tulsa, Okla. ``Right now
we've got a computer to test eyes for glasses that was repossessed
from an optometrist in town.''
   Sometimes disgruntled owners don't let their valuables go
without a fight, but Barnes said repo men don't get rough the way
the character in the 1984 movie ``Repo Man'' did.
   ``The repo guys I know thought the movie was a riot,'' Barnes
said. ``I don't know of any who carry guns. They aren't going to
jeopardize their business with stunts like that.''
   ``We've come a long way from the old image of 300-pound guys who
shake people down for their car keys,'' he said.
   An auctioneer's life is more sedate, though competition is
growing.
   ``Five years ago everybody was doing well, so there weren't as
many auctioneers around,'' said Charles Balyozian, a Boston
auctioneer. ``Now people are rushing to get into this business.''
   He said auctioneers can make $100,000 or more a year.
   Ed Levites of Hingham saw an opportunity to profit from economic
gloom.
   In the mid-1980s he sold new boats. Then that market dried up
and he started hawking used boats. Last year he sold a repossessed
boat for a bank.
   ``Then everybody started calling us,'' Levites. ``We just sort
of fell into the repo business.''
   Now most of Levites' business comes from repossessions. Business
is better than ever, up 30 percent from the peak times of the
1980s.
   Levites usually gets a 10 percent commission to sell boats. The
average boat runs $2,000, and Levites said his company may move
four or five a week.
   ``In the new boat business you have to buy the boat and have it
sit on the showroom floor while you pay interest,'' Levites said.
``In the repo business, the overhead is so much less. You don't
have to buy the boats.''
   Did Levites ever think he'd become a repo man?
   ``Never in a million years.''

   An evangelical Christian and former
Cabinet minister claimed the lead in Guatemala's presidential
election Sunday night and said he hoped to avoid a runoff by
negotiating with the losing parties.
   Jorge Serrano Elias said preliminary returns indicated he would
get at least 40 percent of the vote in the 12-man field.
   ``I'm not sure if there will be a second round,'' the
45-year-old engineer said. It was not immediately clear what sort
of deal he could make to avoid the Jan. 6 runoff required if no
candidate gainst a clear majority.
   If the winner takes office as scheduled, it would be the first
time in Guatemala's troubled, military-dominated history that one
elected civilian had taken office from another.
   As Serrano spoke, firecrackers crackled and flared outside his
campaign headquarters and supporters pressed forward to shake the
hand of the only evangelical Christian left in the race.
   Serrano said he had picked up support from that community, which
includes some 30 percent of the populace, after former dictator
Efrain Rios Montt was forced out of the race by a constitutional
ban on former coup-makers.
   Serrano finished third in 1985 presidential elections. He also
took part in a commission that held talks with leftist guerrillas
aimed at ending the country's 30-year civil war.
   There was gloom in the camp of newspaper publisher Jorge Carpio
Nicolle, who had been favored during early polls, along with
Serrano and former Guatemala City Mayor Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen.
   No voting disruptions were reported, but the violence that has
marred the long campaign continued to the last minute. Carpio's
Union of the National Center said one of its officials in the town
of El Quiche was killed Saturday.
   On election day, however, there were no reports of violence or
interference with the vote, said Ramiro de Leon Carpio, the federal
human rights ombudsman.
   ``My impression is that this is a very open, honest clean
election. I'm impressed,'' said U.S. Ambassador Thomas F. Stroop.
``I hope the vote total is sufficiently big so it cannot be
attacked as being non-representative.''
   Arturo Herbruger Asturias, president of the Supreme Electoral
Tribunal, said the turnout was not expected to be higher than 60
percent of 3.3 million registered voters, compared to 69 percent in
1985.
   Enough returns to indicate a trend in the results were expected
by early Monday.
   The armed forces, who cannot vote, kept a low profile Sunday,
but their armed civil patrols were in evidence in the highlands. In
most places, election-day security was left to the police.
   Guatemala City authorities ordered a special subsidy so that
people could ride buses free of charge. Stores and other businesses
remained closed, and the sale of alcoholic beverages was banned
throughout the day.
   A few streets and avenues were strewn with sharp three-pronged
nails to puncture vehicle tires and snarl traffic, but residents
and municipal workers quickly swept the roads clean. It wasn't
known who left the nails; leftist guerrillas had called for people
to boycott the vote.
   The winner inherits a 30-year-old civil war, a bankrupt
government, 60 percent inflation, and an epidemic of street crime
and human rights abuse.
   He will also have to contend with a nation where more than 70
percent of the people live in dire poverty and where the army and
elite private sector are so powerful that coup rumors are an almost
daily affair.
   The presidential candidates, who range from conservative to far
right, filled their campaigns with vague promises to curb crime and
inflation. Human rights, which implies curbing the army's power,
received scant attention.
   Guatemalans were also electing a vice president, 116 members of
a new congress, 20 delegates to a new Central American Parliament
and 300 mayors.
   It was the second presidential election since Guatemala returned
from military to civilian rule in 1985. But the high hopes that
ushered in democracy have already soured to dismay and cynicism.
   The corruption and ineptitude of President Vinicio Cerezo's
government has discredited his Christian Democrats, Guatemala's
largest and best-organized party, and opened the door to an
electoral free-for-all.
   Cerezo was barred by law from seeking a second term, and Rios
Montt initially emerged as the front-runner with a harsh
law-and-order message.
   But he was ruled ineligible and Serrano, who had served under
Rios Montt, picked up some of the general's support and became a
factor.
   Arzu, 44, is from a wealthy Guatemalan family and was backed by
some of the most conservative elements of the private sector. He
has said he would run this nation of 9 million like a business
enterprise.
   Carpio, 58, who was routed in a 1985 runoff with Cerezo, was
backed by a diverse coalition that ranges from the arch-right to
disaffected socialists.
   The election season brought an outbreak of assassinations,
disappearances and death threats that put Guatemala back on the
international human rights agenda.
   It has been an embarrassment for the United States, which helped
provoke 30 years of brutal dictatorship and civil war with leftist
rebels by backing a military coup against a liberal civilian
government in 1954.
   The United States has poured nearly $1 billion in aid into
Guatemala since civilian rule was restored in 1985, hoping to
create a showcase for free-market democracy.

   Actor Kevin Costner says having his wife,
children and parents on location on the South Dakota prairie while
filming ``Dances with Wolves'' was a distraction, but worth it.
   ``You sometimes find yourself thinking, `I could do this better
if I was by myself,''' he said in the Nov. 19 issue of People

two months with my family.'''
   Costner, 35, stars and debuted as a director in the saga of a
cavalryman who befriends a tribe of Sioux.
   He brought along his wife Cindy, their three children, Annie, 6,
Lily, 4 and Joe, 2 and his parents. He even gave them roles as
pioneers in the movie's opening scene.
   The three-hour epic opened last week. Costner previously starred
in movies including ``Silverado'' and ``Bull Durham.''

   Teacher training, student testing and textbook
selection programs are often so flawed that they hinder efforts to
improve learning, a report says.
   In a mandated congressional report, the chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities sternly condemned basic U.S.
educational practices.
   Lynne V. Cheney said the nation's teaching methods are
``tyrannical machines,'' a phrase coined by philosopher William
James to describe procedures that become both counterproductive and
resistant to change once established on a large scale.
   In addition, Cheney denounced school textbook selection
committees that choose material without reading them, college
education programs in which potential teachers spend little time
studying what they eventually will teach and university systems
that value research more than teaching.
   ``Tyrannical machines dominate American education and have
contributed to its failures,'' Cheney said in the report. ``The
most effective course for dealing with tyrannical machines is to
provide alternative systems and to ensure that people can choose -
and choose wisely - among them.''
   Because of that, Cheney said, allowing students and parents to
decide where to attend school is ``one of the most promising ways
of dismantling tyrannical machines and revitalizing the schools.''
   ``When there are alternative ways to become a teacher or to
choose textbooks or to assess students - and when people know about
them - it is more difficult for outmoded and unsatisfactory methods
to dominate. Healthy competition is anathema to tyrannical
machines,'' she said.
   The report won accolades from Deputy Education Secretary Ted
Sanders, who said, ``We need a revolution in teaching and
learning.''
   But Rod Kelchner, president of Mansfield University in
Mansfield, Pa., said that ``while Cheney makes some valid points,
they are overridden by generalizing and bashing to the point of
absurdity.''
   The Scholastic Aptitude Test, described in the report as the
centerpiece of our educational system, filled an important need
when first devised in the 1920s when officials wanted to detach
college entrance examinations from the high school curriculum. Now,
Cheney said the SAT tries to avoid testing what students have
learned about subjects such as history and literature.
   In the past 10 years, the test has been attacked repeatedly yet
it continues to thrive and to exercise considerable power. She
said, ``not only do institutions of higher education rank students
by their SATs, they in turn are ranked by them, their status going
up or down depending on the average scores of the incoming class.
   ``Secondary schools are judged by SATs: Local housing prices
rise and fall; principals and superintendents are hired and fired;
and the entire nation reaches conclusions about the state of
American education.''
   Cheney said an alternative would be to expand the use of the
National Assessment of Educational Progress, saying it was the sole
assessment tool that is both nationally representative and
comprehensive in calculating what America's students know and can
do in various subject areas.
   College Board President Donald Stewart took issue with Cheney's
assessment of the SAT, saying she ``makes some thought-provoking
and some extremely questionable statements.''
   ``In a nation with over 26,000 secondary schools - with varying
curriculums and teaching and grading standards - the SAT provides
an independent, objective verification of a student's mathematical
and verbal reasoning abilities, skills that are important to
academic success in college,'' he said.
   Stewart also noted the College Board recently agreed to revise
the exam away from mainly multiple choice questions in 1994.
   Among the numerous recommendations, Cheney said:
   -Prospective teachers should be able to choose paths to
certification different from the traditional one. This will bring
diversity to the teaching force, allow comparisons of teacher
training techniques, and encourage schools of education to improve
their programs in order to compete.
   -Teachers in the schools should have abundant opportunities to
study the subjects they teach.
   -Those involved in textbook selection should make use of
textbook reviews done by scholars and teachers in the field to make
informed choices. Schools should be encouraged to use alternatives
to textbooks: stories, speeches, documents, and other authentic
materials.
   -Colleges and universities should develop alternative paths to
recognition and reward, paths that emphasize teaching as well as
research.

their geography exams a year ago. Today, no one is sure of the
answer.
   Lithuania is out, or soon to be. Chuvashia, however, is in.
Latvia, Estonia, Karelia and Georgia are saying goodbye as fast as
they prudently can. Tatarstan, Komi, Mari, Dniester and Gagauz are
ready to take their places.
   ``Sometimes, it's hard to know where you live anymore,'' said
Pyotr Gorbanenko, a legislator in Moldavia, which is simultaneously
seeking independence from the Soviet Union and trying to put down
two internal separatist movements.
   It used to be simple. In 1988, the Soviet Union had 15
republics, each with its own legislature. Scattered among them were
20 smaller ``autonomous republics,'' or homelands for various
ethnic groups.
   The country has been fragmenting since President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev loosened Moscow's grip on power and allowed aggrieved
minorities to speak out.
   That hampers Gorbachev's plans for nationwide economic reform
and getting an agreement among the republics to replace the 1924
treaty of union. It also has led to violence, most recently in
Moldavia.
   Several regions are trying to secede, following the lead of
Lithuania, which declared independence in March.
   In addition to the Baltic republics, there are strong
independence movmements in Karelia, a district of about 140,000
people north of Leningrad that wants to join neighboring Finland;
the western Ukraine, where many people want unification with
Poland, and the southern republics of Armenia, Georgia and
Azerbaijan.
   Regions that don't want to leave the Soviet Union also are
pushing for sovereignty. Several regions are actually trying to
become Soviet republics.
   Some ethnic minorities, such as Moslem Abkhazians in Georgia,
want to break away from larger groups they accuse of
discrimination.
   Others, such as the Tatar, Chuvash, Komi, Mari and Chukchi
peoples in the Russian republic, seek to raise their legal status -
from district to autonomous republic, or from autonomous to
full-fledged republic. Their goals include political power,
cultural preservation and control of natural resources.
   Ethnic and political friction has led repeatedly to violence in
the past two years. In Moldavia last week, the regional government
sent troops to clear roadblocks set up by separatists who had
declared a new republic east of the Dniester River. At least four
people were killed.
   The unrest stemmed from a combination of historical injustices,
ethnic grievances and unfounded rumors, a typical mix that shows
how explosive self-determination can be in a nation whose borders
have changed often in the 20th century.
   Moldavia, which had been a Soviet republic since 1924, more than
doubled in size at the start of World War II, when Stalin annexed
neighboring Bessarabia from Romania under a secret protocol of his
non-aggression treaty with Hitler.
   For the next 45 years, Soviet leaders relentlessly pursued a
policy of Russification. They made Russian the official language,
instead of Romanian, encouraged cultural assimiliation and sent
Russians to run schools, industries and political posts.
   Anatol F. Plugaru, an ethnic Moldavian and former member of the
republic's Communist Party Central Committee, told The Associated
Press he had access in 1987 to a list of the Moldavian
``nomenklatura,'' the top government, business and law enforcement
jobs controlled by the party.
   Although Russians made up only 15 percent of the republic's 4.3
million people, he said, they filled two-thirds of those positions.
   That began changing last year. Thanks to Gorbachev's reforms,
competitive elections gave ethnic Moldavians a parliamentary
majority, including a substantial bloc of delegates aligned with
the pro-independence People's Front.
   The new parliament voted in August 1989 to make Romanian the
official language. While the law said Moldavian citizens retained
the right to speak Russian, it required all people in jobs dealing
with the public, from doctors to hairdressers, to pass tests in
Romanian by 1995.
   Protest strikes were held by Russians and Ukrainians, who are
concentrated within Moldavia's prewar borders east of the Dniester.
They formed Yedinstvo, a group pressing for Moldavia to remain in
the Soviet Union.
   Plugaru claims the Russians were ``were afraid of losing their
privileged positions, which they shouldn't have had to begin
with.''
   Ilya Trombitsky, a legislator who sides with the Russian
minority, said the language law was ``a clear attempt to favor one
ethnic group over another'' and caused widespread fear of Moldavian
nationalism.
   Protests also broke out last year in the Gagauz region, a
southern corner of Moldavia inhabited by about 150,000 descendents
of Christian Turks who fled religious persecution in Bulgaria in
the early 19th century.
   Yuri Roshka, a leader of the Moldavian People's Front, said
Russians from the Dniester area artificially incited discontent in
Gagauz.
   Gagauz leaders say their people were legitimately angry over the
language law and lack of investment in their underdeveloped
agricultural area.
   The conflict boiled over this fall, when the Gagauz and Dniester
regions declared themselves Soviet republics and went ahead with
elections for new legislatures.
   Plugaru says he is confident Moldavia will remain whole and
gradually move toward independence after convincing Gagauz and
Dniester residents they have nothing to fear.
   Trombitsky said he expects the Dniester area to remain part of
the Soviet Union, while western Moldavia eventually reunites with
Romania, possibly taking Gagauz along.
   ``We are all victims of history,'' he said. ``We must learn to
respect each other's rights, because bloodshed is no answer.''

   Stormie Jones' painful journey, which ended
with her sudden death at age 13 six years after her pioneering
heart-liver transplant, blazed the way for other multiple
transplants, doctors say.
   ``We've been able to provide better quality of life and longer
life for many people'' because of Stormie's ordeal, Dr. Jorge
Reyes, staff physician at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said
after Stormie died there Sunday.
   But Stormie didn't like being under a media spotlight,
acquaintances recalled.
   ``She wished everybody would treat her normal instead of like
she had an operation, because she didn't like everybody asking her
how she felt or if she was feeling OK,'' said Crystal Millikan,
Stormie's best friend in her hometown of White Settlement, Texas, a
Fort Worth suburb.
   Stormie endured organ rejection and hepatitis after her historic
double transplant on Valentine's Day 1984 and a second liver
transplant this February.
   ``She went through a lot of pain, you know, as a guinea pig and
as necessity,'' her stepfather, Alan Purcell, said at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport before flying to Pittsburgh.
   ``The pain is over with,'' Purcell said. ``She doesn't hurt any
more.''
   Stormie was rushed from her home to a Texas hospital Saturday
night with a sore throat and fever. She then was flown to the
Pittsburgh hospital.
   Stormie was dehydrated when she arrived, Reyes said. Her
condition didn't appear serious then, but it deteriorated rapidly,
hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon said.
   Her mother at her side, Stormie went into cardiac arrest and
died at 9:52 a.m. Doctors tried for more than an hour to
resuscitate her.
   Preliminary autopsy results were inconclusive, but Reyes said
that if Strmie had a flu virus, it could have caused a rapid or
irregular heartbeat.
   Funeral arrangements were pending, Ms. McMahon said.
   Stormie was 6 when she became the first person to receive a
transplanted heart and liver. Since then, University of Pittsburgh
hospitals have performed at least 10 other transplants involving
the liver and another organ.
   No national statistics are kept on multiple-organ transplants.
Most have been performed at the university's hospitals, the only
ones authorized to use FK-506, an experimental anti-rejection drug
Stormie was taking.
   The nation knew her as a brave teen-ager, but Stormie was famous
around Children's Hospital for her generosity to other patients.
She once bought a book on Chinese so she could communicate with a
3-year-old patient in the toddler's language.
   ``She did that kind of thing all the time,'' McMahon said. ``She
was just so highly regarded by other children. She went to great
lengths to take the time to play with them and talk with them.''
   ``With her strength, she gave strength to other children,''
Reyes said.
   Stormie required the multiple transplant because her own organs
were harmed by familial hypercholesterolemia - blood cholesterol 10
times higher than normal.
   Hepatitis damaged the transplanted liver and Stormie received a
second liver transplant in February.
   The girl returned to Children's in May after her body began
rejecting the liver and again in June because of hepatitis.
   She was released from the hospital after a few weeks, but she
and her mother, Lois ``Susie'' Purcell, stayed in the city until
the infection was controlled.
   Doctors at the time determined Stormie had developed the same
type of hepatitis that damaged her first transplanted liver, but
didn't know why.
   Although any transplant patient is susceptible to infection
because anti-rejection drugs weaken the immune system, ``I wouldn't
particularly focus on the FK-506 as a specific cause,'' Reyes said.
   Doctors, family and friends often had marveled at Stormie's
determination to recover from her many physical setbacks.
   ``I guess it's just hope. There's a thing in the back of your
head that says, `Get up,''' Stormie once told reporters.

   The threat of war in the Persian Gulf shadowed
Veterans Day observances from the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in
Washington to an Army post in Eastern Saudi Arabia.
   ``It looks like many people will be marching in next year's
Veterans Day parades with a banner saying Desert Shield '90-'91,''
2nd Lt. Benjamin Lacy, 23, of Largo, Fla., said at the Mideast post
on Sunday.
   The human cost of any offensive against Iraq to liberate Kuwait
is ``a question that's on everybody's mind,'' Lacy said.
   It was on people's minds here, too.
   It's ``just a matter of time'' until the United States is at war
again, Bob Horsch of Rahway, N.J., a veteran of Army service in
Vietnam, told a reporter at the Vietnam memorial Sunday.
   Horsch said he believes the military buildup in the Persian Gulf
is the right thing to do because ``it is in the interest of the
United States and other countries.''
   Stephen Reuben of Lapwai, Idaho, a member of the Nez Perce tribe
who also served in Vietnam, declined to say whether he believed the
buildup was a good idea, but said he fears the country will go to
war.
   ``I am afraid so, but I pray and hope we don't,'' Reuben said.
   Teresa Swain of Hagerstown, Md., when asked if she supported the
buildup, said, ``We have to protect our interests.'' As to whether
it would mean war, she said, ``I certainly hope not.'' Mrs. Swain
said she has a son-in-law in the Air Force.
   At Arlington National Cemetery, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney
placed a floral wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and told a crowd
of about 5,500, ``Those who have been deployed to the Persian Gulf
and Saudi Arabia are probably the best-trained soldiers we have
ever had.''
   Meanwhile, the jury selecting a design for a memorial to women
who served in Vietnam, to be built adjacent to the Vietnam
Veterans' Memorial, announced that it has selected two finalists
instead of one winner.
   One of the winning designs, by sculptor Eileen Rose Barry of
East Islip, Long Island, is a statue of a woman standing alone with
a helmet in her hand.
   ``She looks like she has been to war and she is going somewhere
else,'' said juror Raquel Ramati, a New York urban desgner. ``She
is dignified and courageous, but she looks like she is part of the
human race. She is not superwoman.''
   The other finalist, by landscape architect Robert Diamond of
Arlington, Mass., consists of 240 jets of water with a large white
marble block at the center. The white will contrast with the black
marble wall, with the names of more than 58,000 Vietnam war dead on
it, that is the central feature of the Vietnam memorial.
   Ms. Ramati said the nine-member jury was divided. Veterans
favored a representational sculpture; designers leaned toward an
abstract design.
   Diane Carlson Evans, director of the project, said the two
finalists would be asked to refine their proposals and the final
design would be a collaboration of the two. The target date for
dedication is 1992.
   At the Vietnam memorial, representatives of military and
patriotic groups placed wreaths in front of the wall as a bagpiper
played ``Abide With Me.''
   The National Park Service estimated the crowd at 5,000. The
weather was bright and sunny, with a crisp wind.
   The ceremonies were held on Sunday, the traditional Veterans
Day, although today is the official national holiday.
   Veterans Day is not a holiday for the 230,000 American troops
deployed in the Persian Gulf, but many remembered their fellow
soldiers who fought in previous wars.
   Lacy said Veterans Day ``means many people before me put their
life on the line. Many died, some are scarred for life. It's time
to honor them.''
   Forty-six soldiers have died so far in Operation Desert Shield,
which was launched in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   The U.S.S. Williamsburg, once Harry S.
Truman's official presidential yacht, is rotting near a sewage
plant on the Potomac River outside Washington and faces demolition.
   The vandalized 243-foot-long hulk has trees growing through its
deck and is covered with broken glass and empty beer bottles, The
Kansas City Star reported Sunday.
   If no one takes the former beauty of black steel, teak trim and
mirror-polished brass, it faces demolition in July 1992, the
newspaper reported.
   Through the years the Williamsburg has had a variety of owners.
It had a brief stint as a floating restaurant in New Jersey in
1969, and before that the National Science Foundation in Norfolk,
Va. used it as a laboratory, the Star said.
   The ship became available about two weeks ago to anyone who
could prove to the District of Columbia that it would be restored,
said Kim Nielsen, chief of photography for the Smithsonian
Institution's Freer and Sackler museums.
   ``People have no conscience about destroying things of historic
value,'' said Nielsen, a nautical history buff.
   ``They want to see George Washington's teeth and Abraham
Lincoln's chair. But here we have President Truman's yacht, where
he spent half of his presidential career, and nobody cares.''
   Nielsen is trying to find a future for the yacht and he
envisions the Midwest as its brightest hope. Independence, Mo., to
be more specific - Truman's home.
   But the idea of moving the Williamsburg to the Midwest is
hopeless, local leaders and entrepreneurs say.
   ``It's one of those cases where the powers that be have turned
their backs on it,'' said Richard Lynn, a Kansas City, Kan.,
riverboat operator who researched the possibilities of the
investment.
   ``It's nothing but a rusting hulk.''
   The ship weighs 2,000 tons and is 36 feet wide with a 14-foot
draft.
   ``The depth did us in,'' Lynn said. ``We don't have that much in
the river.''
   The Williamsburg also isn't seaworthy and probably wouldn't fit
under many river bridges.
   Nielsen estimated that even though the ship would be donated,
the restoration would cost about $7 million - more if the ship is
to ever sail again.
   Nielsen said to build a ship its size from scratch today would
cost somewhere between $12 million and $20 million. And the
Williamsburg could be eligible for federal funds if it were to be
named a national landmark.
   Dan McGraw of Independence looked into bringing the yacht to
Independence about four years ago. When he finally tracked it down,
it was privately owned and scheduled to again become a floating
restaurant in New Jersey. The city of Independence dropped its
queries.
   Then Nielsen called McGraw two weeks ago to say the ship was
available.
   But now, McGraw said, ``I don't think the city's going to get
involved in it. I don't know what the city of Independence would do
with it.''

   In their biggest offensive of the year,
leftist guerrillas attacked two adjacent towns in northern Colombia
and about 40 people were killed, authorities said.
   The army and police drove back some 1,000 members of two
guerrilla groups who together attacked the towns of Taraza and
Caceres in northern Colombia Saturday, the Antioquia state
government said Sunday.
   Nine soldiers and 16 guerrillas died in the five-hour gun and
mortar battle in Taraza, 250 miles north of Bogota. Eight soldiers
were also wounded before the rebels were driven back into the
mountains, the government said in a statement.
   Among the dead was the Taraza army base commander, Lt. Col.
Jaime Farjardo, who fought alongside his men and became one of the
highest ranking casualties of Colombia's 30-year guerrilla
struggle.
   In Caceres, the rebels killed a police officer, destroyed the
city hall and damaged the police station. The retreating guerrillas
carried more than 10 dead and several wounded with them into the
mountains, it said.
   Authorities said Saturday's attacks were carried out by the
country's two active guerrilla groups - the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, and the National Liberation Army.
   Late Saturday, four rebels were killed in another battle between
the army and the Liberation Army, according to a Defense Ministry
statement.
   Just Thursday, the two guerrilla groups had offered to initiate
peace talks with the government, and released 22 police hostages as
a goodwill gesture.
   In a statement released Sunday, President Cesar Gaviria's
administration said ``the possiblity of peace talks is being driven
farther into the distance'' by the rebel attacks.
   About 10,000 people belong to six major rebel groups. More than
75,000 people have died in political violence associated with the
guerrilla war.
   The April 19 Movement, or M19, became the country's first rebel
group to transform itself into a political party when it laid down
its arms last April.
   Commentaries published in the two newspapers, meanwhile,
reflected divisions over how Gaviria should deal with another major
problem - drug traffickers, now believed holding nine kidnapped
journalists.
   ``President Gaviria and his government now more than ever have
the opportunity to exercise their authority,'' said an editorial in
El Espectador newspaper, a leading advocate of tough policy against
drug traffickers.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel is accused of bombing El
Espectador's Bogota offices last year as part of a terrorist
campaign to pressure the government into calling off its anti-drug
crackdown. It also allegedly murdered El Espectador's publisher,
Guillermo Cano, in 1986.
   Juan Gomez Martinez, the publisher of Medellin's El Colombiano
newspaper, offered in a letter published Sunday to allow drug
traffickers to publish their denunciations of government human
rights violations.
   The cartel claims police have tortured and slain its members
since the government launched a crackdown on the cartel in August
1989.

   The legal showdown in the Southeastern mail bombs
case will pit the man who prosecuted New York's ``Pizza
Connection'' drug case against a pair of ponytailed lawyers known
for defending controversial clients.
   Added to that mix is outspoken U.S. District Judge Richard
Freeman and a crime that has held the Southeast's attention for
nearly a year.
   Walter Leroy Moody Jr., of Rex, Ga., is accused of mailing bombs
to a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer last December, killing
both.
   Defending him are Atlanta lawyers Bruce Harvey and Michael
Hauptman, both associated with the American Civil Liberties Union
but acting in this case as court-appointed attorneys.
   Each wears a diamond earring and graying hair pulled back in a
ponytail.
   Hauptman appeared on Geraldo Rivera's television talk show this
year, discussing his marriage to Dolores French, author of
``Working: My Life as a Prostitute.''
   Prosecuting the case is Assistant U.S. Attorney Louis Freeh, who
handled the 1987 ``Pizza Connection'' drug case in New York.
   ``You've got three great lawyers,'' said Robert Fogelnest, a New
York lawyer familiar with all of them.
   Freeh, he said, ``is as tough as they come.'' The defense
lawyers are ``courageous and not afraid to take on unpopular
cases.''
   Moody was named in a 70-count indictment last week after an
11-month investigation of the mail bomb killings of U.S. Circuit
Judge Robert Vance in Alabama and attorney Robert Robinson in
Georgia.
   If convicted on all 70 counts, Moody could be sentenced to seven
life terms plus 385 years in prison and fines of $16.9 million.
   No trial date has been set.
   In the first of a number of expected pretrial motions, Moody's
lawyers last week asked that every federal judge in the United
States be barred from the case, claiming no such judge could be
impartial.
   That motion is pending.
   Each defense lawyer has taken several controversial cases.
   Among Harvey's past clients are convicted Columbus, Ga.,
``stocking strangler'' Carlton Gary and Jerome Bowden, a convicted
murderer whose 1986 execution continued the debate over whether
capital punishment should apply to the mentally retarded.
   Hauptman, president of the Georgia ACLU, recently successfully
challenged the state's mask law on behalf of a member of the Ku
Klux Klan. The law had banned Klan members from wearing masks in
public. He also has represented many capital murder defendants.
   Although deadly serious in the courtroom, they display a wry
sense of humor outside.
   After seeking to bar federal judges from the case, Harvey was
asked where - if the motion succeeds - the case might end up.
``Hopefully, somewhere near a beach,'' he replied.
   Freeh, known as low-key but extremely tough, prosecuted the
17-month-long heroin importing case dubbed the ``Pizza Connection''
because participants allegedly used pizza parlors as fronts.
   In that case, Salvatore Catalano, a reputed former chief of the
Sicilian Mafia, was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in prison.
   Freeman, an outspoken judge who tightly controls his court,
earlier this year criticized the FBI for leaking details of the
investigation, saying Moody's right to a fair trial was risked by
``some loudmouthed agent.''
   However, he may excuse himself from the trial.
   ``The chance of an Atlanta judge trying this case is small,''
said Atlanta attorney James K. Jenkins. ``You have a collegiality
among judges in a circuit that have relationships that would make
any judge look at it (excusing himself) seriously.''

   Emperor Akihito ascended to the world's oldest
hereditary monarchy today, the first in a legendary 2,600-year-old
line of emperors to be enthroned as a national symbol rather than a
living god.
   Leftist extremists, who consider the institution of emperor an
unconstitutional relic of Japan's militarist past, attacked
military bases, train stations and Shinto shrines in protest.
   Police counted at least 34 guerrilla attacks timed to coincide
with the coronation of the late Emperor Hirohito's 56-year-old son.
None appeared to cause any injuries.
   A record 37,000 police had been mobilized to guard the
ceremonies as well as the attending dignitaries from 158 countries,
including Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles
and Princess Diana.
   For his coronation, Akihito wore a red-brown silk kimono and hat
of ancient design and sat on an elaborate lacquered throne in front
of an Imperial Palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying
bows and swords.
   He vowed to ``discharge my duties as symbol of the state and of
the unity of the people'' under Japan's postwar constitution, which
fundamentally restructured the monarchy.
   Hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war, but
Akihito becomes the first of Japan's 125 emperors, including those
listed only in legend, to take the throne as a mere mortal and not
a priest-king.
   He said he would perform his role in the same spirit as his
father, who ``shared joys and sorrows with the people at all
times'' during a 62-year reign that encompassed both the
devastation of World War II and Japan's dramatic recovery.
   Empress Michiko, dressed in a multicolored gown, her face
painted white, sat motionless on her own throne at Akihito's side
throughout the 30-minute ceremony.
   The ritual ended with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu standing
stiffly before Akihito in a morning suit and leading the Japanese
guests in three cries of ``Banzai'' - he traditional wish for long
life.
   He led the cheers from a point level with the base of the
throne, to underscore the constitution's stress on popular
sovereignty.
   A 21-gun salute blasted from an adjacent park.
   The ancient, mystical enthronement rites are said to date back
to 660 B.C.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko later left the palace grounds in an
open Rolls Royce, ringed by dozens of police motorcycles and waving
and smiling to cheering crowds. They had changed to formal Western
clothes.
   Many of the estimated 110,000 people along the three-mile parade
route to Akasaka Palace, the couple's home, yelled ``Banzai'' and
waved national flags as the 44-car parade passed. Nearly 10,000
police lined the route.
   There was one shaky moment, however, when firecrackers popped as
the emperor's car passed by. Police with German shepherds rushed in
and arrested several people, some of whom handed out leaflets
calling Hirohito a war criminal.
   Leftist radicals who want the imperial house abolished made
themselves heard all across the capital. Police said they arrested
about a dozen of the several thousand protesters who held
anti-imperial rallies around Tokyo.
   In one park, hundreds of masked members of the ultra-leftist
Chukakuha, or Middle Core Faction, chanted ``Smash the enthronement
ceremony!''
   One man attempted to commit hara-kiri, or traditional suicide by
disembowelment, in front of the Imperial Palace but was rushed to a
hospital, police said. There were no immediate details on his
condition or motivation.
   Radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases
and a fourth in western Tokyo, the Defense Agency reported. Police
reported another attack outside the U.S. naval base at Atsugi, 24
miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at
three Tokyo train stations that stopped traffic on two major
commuter lines, police reported.
   Fires erupted at four Shinto shrines in Tokyo, including one
less than a mile from Akihito's residence, destroying two.
   Japanese flags lined the main streets in the Ginza shopping
district, where cars and trucks painted with rightist slogans
paraded. Speakers blared ``Long live the emperor,'' as riot police
stood by.
   But many Japanese were ignoring the ceremonies, taking advantage
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses
and driving ranges. Long lines of people queued in front of movie
theaters.
   One poll indicated nearly half of the Japanese were not
interested in the enthronement.
   Akihito became emperor immediately after the death of Hirohito
in January 1989, but his enthronement was delayed until after a
period of mourning.

   The government of Chad says its troops have beaten
back an attack by Libyan-supported mercenaries who crossed the
border from Sudan.
   The invaders were repelled after 24 hours of ``violent combat''
in the Tine region of eastern Chad, said a communique issued late
Sunday by Chad's Embassy in Paris.
   Chad said the offensive was launched Saturday by the Islamic
Legion, which it described as a force of 2,000 mercenaries equipped
with armored vehicles and supported by Libya and Sudan.
   Both those countries subsequently denied any role in the
fighting, saying that only Chadian dissidents were involved.
   The Chadian communique made no mention of casualties, but said
the attackers retreated in disarray toward their base in the
Sudanese province of Darfour.
   Libya and Chad fought a war in the early 1980s and have since
engaged in sporadic negotiations over their disputed border. The
most recent round of talks were held last month.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Akihito has long lived in the shadow of his
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, and the memories of Japan's
headlong march into the Pacific War that Hirohito's name evoked.
   But now that Akihito has assumed the throne left by his father's
death, many Japanese are looking to him as the symbol of a new age
- that of the generation who experienced war as children and
rebuilt the nation in peace.
   Akihito was 11 at the end of World War II, which Japanese
militarists had urged the nation into in the name of his father.
   The impact of surrender and reform under the guidance of
U.S.-led occupation forces deeply affected his youth.
   Before Akihito turned 13, Hirohito made his historic
renunciation of imperial divinity.
   Occupation troops departed Japan in 1952, leaving behind them a
democratic constitution that renounced war and defined Japan's
monarchs as ``symbols,'' not the priest-kings of bygone days.
   That imperial role seems to fit Akihito, who in one of his first
duties after assuming the throne upon the death of Hirohito in
January 1989 promised to uphold the constitution ``along with the
people.''
   Akihito, born Dec. 23, 1933, bears a strong physical resemblance
to Hirohito, and has inherited his father's short, almost frail,
build. He also has his father's passion for science, and is a
respected scholar in the study of gobies, a type of mud-sucking
fish.
   Akihito speaks fluent English and is Japan's most widely
traveled emperor. He has made official visits to 37 countries, his
first to England for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
   Reflecting the circumstances of his upbringing, Akihito is often
described by former schoolmates and palace officials as a more
democratically-minded, warmer person than the quiet, reclusive
Hirohito.
   He has also been far more prone to set his own precedents.
   Just three years after completing his education - Akihito was
the first emperor schooled alongside commoners - the royal heir
chose a commoner for his bride, making another break from the past.
   The woman, Michiko Shoda, was the daughter of one of the
nation's wealthiest businessmen, but their marriage in 1959 sent
shock waves through Japan's former nobility.
   To the rest of the nation, however, the wedding was welcomed as
none before. About 500,000 people lined the streets for a chance to
see Akihito and Michiko in their horse-drawn carriage during a
parade after the ceremony.
   The royal couple again broke with tradition by raising their own
children, a decision prompted in part by Akihito's desire to have
the family life he was denied as a child, according to Minoru
Hamao, a former imperial chamberlain.
   Taken away from his parents at an early age to be raised by
strangers, Akihito at times complained of the loneliness he felt
when his classmates would talk to him about their homes, said
Hamao, who served Akihito for two decades.
   Akihito's first child and heir, Crown Prince Naruhito, was born
Feb. 23, 1960. They have another son, Prince Akishino, and
daughter, Princess Nori.
   Though the crown prince remains single, Prince Akishino earlier
this year wed Kiko Kawashima - who, like the empress, had no royal
lineage.

   Clear skies and warm temperatures prevailed again today
throughout most of the West, Southwest and Southeast, but it was
wintry in the Midwest and Northeast.
   Showers were expected today in western Washington, already
deluged by two days of heavy rains that caused widespread flooding,
damage and evacuations. However, sunshine Sunday gave the soggy
state some time to dry out.
   Snow and cold, windy weather was forecast through at least
tonight across the Great Lakes into Pennsylvania, New York and New
England. Light snow fell in parts of the region Sunday night.
   Temperatures were unseasonably warm Sunday in the West, with
record highs in many cities. Among them was Helena, Mont., which
reached 72 degrees, one degree above the mark in 1894 and 28
degrees warmer than normal for the date.
   The high temperature for the nation Sunday was 93 degrees at

<HEAD>Panic-Buying As Fuel-Saving Plan Takes Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Huge lines formed at gasoline
stations throughout the city today as a government plan went into
effect to limit sales and save fuel in the wake of the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Industry officials warned that the panic-buying was dangerously
depleting gasoline supplies.
   Industry and congressional sources criticized the government
plan and complained that President Corazon Aquino's administration
had failed to consult the private sector. They also criticized the
government for failing to inform the public on details of the
fuel-saving plan.
   The Philippines imports all its oil, and about 85 percent comes
from the Middle East.
   Station owners said panic-buying began Sunday, one day before
the start of government restrictions on hours of operation. Many
stations closed early Sunday, claiming they had run out of
supplies.
   Others limited customers to purchases of $4.50, enough for a
quarter tank in mid-sized cars.
   Last week, the Energy Regulatory Board ordered stations to
operate only between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. during work days and to
close at 5 p.m. on Sundays.
   On Friday, Mrs. Aquino also ordered the three national oil
companies to curb sales by 10 percent as part of the conservation
plan. Under the order, service stations will only receive supplies
every 10 days.
   Pedro Lobos, vice president of the Philippine Petroleum Dealers
Association, said that if panic-buying continues, the 10-day
supplies will be gone in two or three days.
   Lobos urged the government to suspend the 10 percent reduction
order to allow time to devise a workable conservation plan.
   Long lines extended from the stations out into major streets,
clogging traffic during the morning rush hour.
   Presidential Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig said there
was no cause for panic-buying.
   ``I don't know about it, but I will look into it,'' he said.
``Maybe this was brought about by the price increase being
predicted in the media.''
   Mrs. Aquino was out of the country today. She had left Sunday
for Japan to attend the enthronement of Emperor Akihito despite a
self-imposed ban on foreign travel because of the country's
economic and political problems.
   Before leaving, she ordered the Cabinet Security Committee to
meet today to discuss contingency plans for saving fuel.
   ``If we don't discipline ourselves, then we cannot prolong our
present inventory of oil,'' said the committee's chairman, Justice
Secretary Franklin Drilon.
   The country's fuel crisis was brought about by the steep decline
in dollar reserves because of the depreciation of the Philippine
peso.
   That was caused in part by a decline in convertible currency
coming into the country after thousands of Filipinos lost their
jobs in Kuwait after the Aug 2. Iraqi invasion.
   Transportation Secretary Oscar Orbos said the government was
considering other conservation measures, including rationing fuel
and banning private cars during certain hours.
   The Energy Regulatory Board said last month that the country had
enough oil reserves for 59 days. The board said the normal reserve
was 70 days.

   A day of sunshine eased flooding that
caused millions of dollars in damage. Many people returned to their
homes, but two islands remained evacuated today.
   After heavy rain Friday and Saturday, warm, sunny weather on
Sunday lowered flood waters enough that Interstate 5 in Skagit
County and some smaller roads could reopen, said Michael Stewart,
spokesman for the state Division of Emergency Management.
   ``It is receding, but it isn't gone away,'' Stewart said.
   Several roads, including some highways, remained closed. No
injuries were reported and most dikes and levees held.
   The National Weather Service canceled flood warnings for all but
the Skagit and Snohomish rivers. Light, scattered rain was forecast
this afternoon.
   Gov. Booth Gardner declared a state of emergency Sunday in five
counties where flooding of seven northwest Washington rivers forced
more than 600 people from their homes. Damage was expected to reach
more than $10 million.
   About 200 residents of Fir Island, a farming community near the
mouth of the Skagit River, and at least 100 residents of Ebey
Island on the Snohomish River, likely would not be allowed home
before Tuesday, Stewart said.
   The western half of Fir Island was under water and livestock was
rescued. There was a 200-foot break in the island's dike.
   Gardner's proclamation covers Skagit, Snohomish, Whatcom, Grays
Habor and King counties and directs state resources to local
governments.
   Property damages in Whatcom County could approach $10 million,
said Bill Quehrn of the county Department of Emergency Services.
   A damage estimate for Skagit County will not be available until
flood waters recede and residents return, Stewart said.
   Red Cross shelters housed about 100 people and provided more
than 2,000 free meals over the weekend in Skagit and Whatcom
counties.
   Three houses were destroyed in the resort town of Glacier.
   In Vancouver, British Columbia, flooding in Fraser Valley was
receding. Rail lines and highways in the area had been washed out
or blocked.
   The raging Salmon River stranded families in the Sayward Valley
on northeastern Vancouver Island. Rescuers took about 30 people out
by truck and inflatable boat Sunday but 62 others awaited rescue
today by helicopter.

   A kitten survived the hair-raising
experience of being sucked up by the 175 mph force of a vacuum hose
on a leaf-collector truck.
   Instead of being cut by the machinery, the homeless
orange-and-white kitten landed safely in a pile of leaves inside
the collection bin Friday.
   ``Usually anything that goes in there is pretty much history,''
said Robert Taylor of the highway department.
   Workers who realized the machine had sucked up a kitten, and
petrified that they might have killed someone's beloved pet,
decided to see how the animal had fared.
   They dug about 4 feet into the collection bin - and saw nothing.
Then they dumped the leaves out and carefully poked around with a
rake. Expecting to see a ghastly sight, they were relieved to find
the kitten unharmed but visibly shaken.
   ``It looked like one of those Halloween cats with its hair
standing straight up,'' Taylor said. ``It was so scared, but we
couldn't believe he was alive.''
   The kitten's owners couldn't be found, so Charles and Lucia
Klemovich agreed to take it in.
   To distinguish the little one from their three other cats -
Scratch, Itch and Blacky - the Klemovichs gave the kitten what they
believed is a well-earned name - Hoover.

   Typhoon Mike, with winds of up to 150
mph, roared toward the central Philippines today after it left a
trail of devastation in the western Pacific islands of Palau.
   The Manila weather bureau said the storm was located about 190
miles southeast of the town of Borongan on the central island of
Samar early today. Borongan is 230 miles southeast of Manila.
   It was moving west-northwest at 15 mph with strongest sustained
winds of 150 mph and gusts of up to 175 mph. It was expected to
make landfall over the southern tip of Samar at dawn Tuesday and
then hit Masbate island, 155 miles southeast of Manila, in the
afternoon.
   Maximum storm warnings were raised in six provinces southeast of
Manila, where forecasters said seas would be dangerous for all
types of vessels. Lesser storm alerts were raised over most of the
central Visayas islands.
   Authorities advised residents living in coastal areas on Samar
and Leyte islands and the northern region of the southern island of
Mindanao to move to higher ground.
   Classes were also canceled in most of northern Mindanao today.
The state-own Philippine Airlines canceled 10 flights to central
and southern cities today and 13 flights Tuesday to the same areas.
   The typhoon is the 14th to hit the Philippines this year. About
20 typhoons hit the country yearly.
   Over the weekend, the storm toppled trees, devastated crops and
battered buildings in Palau. Electrical power was among the
services knocked out Saturday when the typhoon, which then had
winds of up to 172 mph, swept through Palau's northern islands.
   Only eight of 200 islands in the Palau island chain are
inhabited; the population is about 15,000.
   No serious injuries were reported, but the typhoon dumped nearly
10 inches of rain in the U.S. trust's capital city, Koror, between
Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning.
   Winds leveled up to 90 percent of the major crops of bananas and
coconuts.
   A serious health problem could develop in Koror because sewer
wastes were backing up into some homes, officials said.
   Before hitting Palau, the typhoon swept past Yap, in the
Federated States of Micronesia, with winds gusting to 60 mph,
causing minor damage to crops and homes.

   Seven blacks died in violence
near Johannesburg, and thousands of black workers in the capital,
Pretoria, stayed home today to protest electricity cutoffs in the
townships outside the city.
   Police said five men were killed in Katlehong, a township
southeast of Johannesburg that has been wracked by black factional
fighting for several months.
   A police spokeswoman, Lt. Ida van Zweel, said the battle with
guns and knives was between Xhosa and Zulu tribal members at a
squatter camp on the edge of the township.
   Also, a man was hacked to death and set on fire in Sebokeng,
south of Johannesburg. In Jouberton, southwest of the city, a youth
died when police fired on a group throwing gasoline bombs at a
policeman's house. The police unrest report gave no additional
details.
   Meanwhile, most black workers in Pretoria took part in a one-day
stayaway organized by anti-apartheid groups aligned with the
African National Congress, the leading black opposition group.
   There were few blacks on the streets and shops that employ
blacks had to rely on their white staff.
   The stayaway was called to protest power cuts in the neighboring
townships. Authorities shut off electricity last week because
residents were not paying their bills in a protest against poor
living conditions.
   Residents and police clashed Saturday in the Atteridgeville
township, leaving two dead and 18 injured. The government on Sunday
imposed a 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew and gave police expanded powers
in Atteridgeville and nearby Saulsville.
   Organizers said today's stayaway also was meant to express
opposition to the government in the nearby black homeland of
Bophuthatswana.
   Activists see the tribal territories as part of the apartheid
system of racial segregation and have called for the four homelands
with nominal independence to be reincorporated into South Africa.
   The president of Bophuthatswana, Lucas Mangope, has refused to
consider rejoining South Africa despite mounting opposition to his
rule. Today's stayaway also affected businesses in Bophuthatswana.
   Police in Bophuthatswana said today they had detained an
unspecified number of ANC supporters allegedly plotting to kill
Mangope and overthrow the homeland government.
   ``The arrest and detention of ANC members and other activists
... is but one more example of an unpopular regime trying to
postpone its demise by repression,'' the ANC said in a statement.
   In the three other ``independent'' homelands - Transkei, Ciskei
and Venda - army members have staged coups in recent years and
developed good relations with the ANC.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela told a rally in Venda on Sunday that
the ANC and the homelands should ``forget about past differences
and unite.''
   ``The ANC has decided to call upon homeland leaders to rally
behind it,'' Mandela told some 20,000 blacks at a sports stadium.
He appeared with Venda's military ruler, Brig. Gabriel Ramushwana.

Investigations, and no one was injured in the bombings of the
unoccupied cars early Sunday morning at the base adjoining the
Army's Fort Lewis near Tacoma, said Master Sgt. Gloria Rayford.
   No arrests were made, nor were investigators immediately able to
determine who might be responsible, Rayford said.
   But terrorism was not suspected because no note was left, nor
did anyone call to claim responsibility, Sgt. Randy Mitchell said.
   Investigators would not comment on the type of bombs placed
above the left rear wheel of each of the damaged cars, but said
they did not believe military-type explosives were involved.
   The Office of Special Investigations handles cases involving
security problems and serious crimes. ``They're sort of the FBI for
the Air Force,'' Rayford said.
   Air Force Capt. John L. Litten said he did not know whether the
office was involved in any unusual investigations.
   The McChord base employs about 4,800 people on active duty and
1,300 to 1,00 civilians.

   Vandals decapitated a recently dedicated statue
of a slain Polish priest and scrawled a seemingly pro-Communist
message on it.
   The granite head of the 9-foot statue of Jerzy Popieluszko was
found in a nearby trash can, said Officer Scott Bloch, a police
spokesman. Painted on the base were the Polish words, ``Za Lenina
Za Stalina,'' which means, ``For Lenin For Stalin.''
   The vandalism in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn was
discovered Sunday - Independence Day in Poland.
   Popieluszko, whose sermons bolstered the then-outlawed
Solidarity labor movement, was abducted Oct. 19, 1984. His beaten
and bound body was pulled from a river 11 days later, galvanizing
the anti-Communist movement. Four secret police were convicted of
his slaying.
   The Rev. John Lazar said some parishioners at Our Lady of
Consulation Roman Catholic Church wept when the vandalism was noted
during Mass.
   ``Although the priest has been dead for six years, he stays very
much alive in the hearts and memories of the Polish people,'' Lazar
said.
   The statue, dedicated Oct. 28, is a blocklike structure with the
upper torso of the priest emerging from the top.

<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins told fellow big-city mayors
that urban areas deserve federal funds in exchange for supplying a
labor force and tax revenues.
   Dinkins and 33 other mayors, who met here Sunday to discuss the
survival of their cities, said federal tax revenues generated by in
them help fuel the nation's economic growth.
   ``Cities are our nation's marketplaces, not only for business
but also for ideas,'' Dinkins said. ``If we choke off our cities by
denying them the resources they need to function efficiently, the
marketplaces will disappear.''
   The mayoral summit meeting - which continues through Tuesday -
is focusing on urban issues such as combating drug abuse, improving
education and paying for costly building projects such as bridges
and roads.
   Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said property taxes alone won't
pay the bills for solving such problems.
   Many of the mayors speaking Sunday, most of them Democrats, said
the federal government was neglecting urban areas. For instance, in
1980, federal funds made up 19.4 percent of New York City's budget;
currently that share is 9.7 percent, Dinkins said.
   Dinkins just last week announced that he had to cut 5,400 city
jobs to close a $388 million municipal budget gap.
   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn complained that cities aren't getting
enough federal aid to support drug education.
   The mayors also got a look at a survey prepared for the urban
summit that showed many non-urban Americans support efforts to help
cities.
   The survey found that 74 percent of those living outside cities
would be willing to pay higher taxes to provide housing for the
poor; 71 percent of non-urban residents would be willing to pay
higher taxes for AIDS treatment programs; 66 percent would be
willing to pay higher taxes for better urban public schools; and 63
percent would be willing to pay higher taxes for drug
rehabilitation programs in cities.
   The survey of a random sample of 1,199 Americans, made during
early October, was done by the City University of New York's Office
of Urban Affairs. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent.

<TEXT>
   Books by Soviet leaders, including President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, are no longer guaranteed space on store
shelves and those that don't sell are being shredded, a newspaper
said today.
   However, books by the founder of the Soviet state, Vladimir I.
Lenin, are still considered sacred and cannot be destroyed, the
weekly Sobesednik said.
   The newspaper, aimed at Soviet youth, quoted a bookshop manager
as saying works by Gorbachev, Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov are not selling
and have been written off.
   ``These books sell poorly, and to sell even one brochure is a
victory,'' M. Chuchaikina, director of Bookstore Number 67 in
Moscow, told the newspaper.
   She said a total of 17 books and publications by Gorbachev,
Shevardnadze and Ryzhkov as well as pamphlets on the 28th Communist
Party Congress and the 19th Communist Party Conference have been
sent to the shredders on orders of the Moscow Directorate of
Bookstores.
   The newspaper said it was the first time in Soviet history that
works by active leaders had been written off as non-sellers and
destroyed. ``Previously, such actions were equal to crimes against
the state,'' it said.
   Sobesednik said Politizdat, publishers of works by Soviet
leaders and other political books and pamphlets, used to routinely
produce such works in lots of 200,000 copies. Now, the average
number is between 15,000 and 20,000, it said.
   Chuchaikina was quoted as saying the works of Lenin were still
considered sacrosanct.
   ``We are not allowed to write off Lenin, those books are
sacred,'' she told the newspaper. Instead, she said, they are
stored in basements where ``they rot, they grow moldy and fall
apart.''
   One method of getting rid of the unwanted books, she said, was
making customers purchase several in order to buy popular
bestsellers.

   Boris Yeltsin, the outspoken president of the
Russian Federation, today accused rival Mikhail S. Gorbachev of
trying to pressure his republic into ceding some economic powers to
the central government.
   ``But we couldn't and will not go for that,'' Yeltsin told a
legislative committee.
   Yeltsin and Gorbachev, the two most powerful Soviet politicians
and frequent critics of each other's policies, met in the Kremlin
on Sunday for four hours of what were intended as peacemaking
talks.
   But Yeltsin came out with more criticism of Soviet authorities,
especially over negotiations on a new treaty to group the 15
splintering Soviet republics.
   ``They pressed us yesterday and earlier to first sign a union
treaty and then resolve remaining issues, in the meantime
transferring everything to the authority of the center,'' Yeltsin
told the Russian Federation's constitutional commission. His
remarks were carried by the independent Interfax news agency.
   Yeltsin did not use Gorbachev's name, but the Soviet president
appeared to be his target. In the end, an agreement was reached to
resolve differences this year, before the treaty is signed, Yeltsin
told the commission.
   Soviet authorities and Russian authorities will form parallel
groups to work on issues, Interfax said, included banking, property
and the money supply.
   Yeltsin also listed disputes over control of oil, gas, gold and
other precious metals as among the issues the committees would try
to resolve, the official news agency Tass reported.
   The Russian Federation and most other republics are at odds with
the central Soviet government over who should control what. The
Russian parliament has declared its laws take precedence over
national legislation and has passed a plan for switching to a
market economy in 500 days.
   Earlier today, the prime minister of Russia said he told Soviet
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov his republic wants to help
strengthen the union, but also wants more powers itself.
   ``We understand this mission and intend to implement it,
strengthening the union. But on new principles of economic
cooperation, on principles of political interaction as a sovereign
state in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,'' Russian Prime
Minister Ivan Silaev told defense plant managers, gathered in the
Russian Federation's government headquarters.
   Silaev and Ryzhkov joined in the Kremlin session after Yeltsin
and Gorbachev met alone.
   The popular Yeltsin, whom Gorbachev ousted from the Communist
Party Politburo in 1988, has criticized the Soviet leader for not
moving fast enough on reforms.

<HEAD>Pro-Democracy Party Might Establish Provisional Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANERPLAW, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest guerrilla group fighting the
government has invited the country's principal pro-democracy party
to form a provisional government in rebel-held areas, an insurgent
leader said today.
   Tin Maung Win, general secretary of the Democratic Alliance of
Burma rebel group, spoke on the eve of a meeting between his group
and members of the National League for Democracy, the nation's
leading pro-democracy party.
   There was no immediate response from the League to the offer.
   ``The government has no intention of transferring power and
continues to suppress any moves toward democracy and so we have an
obligation to the Burmese people to take a definite course of
action,'' Tin Maung Win said.
   The League easily won general elections in May, but the ruling
military junta has refused to relinquish power. Instead, the party
has been crippled in recent months by arrests of its leaders and
organizers.
   Last month, the government arrested four of the few remaining
League central committee members and raided the party's offices
nationwide.
   The military also has moved against dissidents among the
Buddhist clergy, raiding monasteries and arresting monks.
   Tin Maung Win said the League had been invited to form a
national coalition government with the Democratic Alliance of
Burma. He spoke at the rebel stronghold of Manerplaw, along the
Thai-Burmese border.
   The Manerplaw-based alliance is the largest rebel group fighting
the Rangoon government. It consists of 22 ethnic minority and
dissident groups and controls about one-third of the country -
mostly areas bordering Thailand, Bangladesh and China.
   Tin Maung Win said there was fear that the ruling State Law and
Order Restoration Council would outlaw the League, and it therefore
was being offered ``sanctuary in the liberated zone.''
   ``The League cannot function in Rangoon any more, let alone form
a government,'' he told reporters.
   Tin Maung Win said the new government would be temporary,
``until the League can stand on its own two feet and declare a
legitimate government in Rangoon,''
   It was not known how many League members had fled to Manerplaw
or other rebel-held areas. But there have been scattered reports of
both party members and monks fleeing the cities to avoid arrest.
   A dozen ethnic minority groups have waged a long, bloody war
against the central government, demanding more autonomy. Since
1988, they have been joined by students and others fleeing
repression in the interior.
   The military violently crushed a nationwide pro-democracy
movement in September 1988. One of the major figures of that
movement and a League leader - Aung San Suu Kyi - has been under
house arrest in Rangoon since July 1989.
   Last week, the London-based Amnesty International said it had
reports of widespread torture of political detainees in Burma. A
team of U.N. human rights investigators left Burma on Sunday, but
Rangoon-based diplomats said the military had severely restricted
activities of the team.

<TEXT>
   Through a long history of revolt and protest,
France has seen nothing like it.
   Day after day, students in the tens of thousands march
arm-in-arm through French cities, praised by teachers and parents,
demanding the government make their schools safer and better.
   In 1968, brigades of leftist university students fought with
riot police in Paris, displaying contempt for all aspects of
authority.
   This fall, teen-agers campaign peacefully for a fair chance to
join the establishment. Their leaders confer with police commanders
to negate the impact of troublemakers exploiting the protests.
   Marches and rallies began more than three weeks ago and
intensified in the past week with daily protests across France.
   Today, in their biggest protest yet, tens of thousands of high
school students, many from distant cities, marched through Paris
with hundreds of supporters.
   The students' goals seem so reasonable that even pillars of the
establishment are helping out. Officials of the national railroad,
persuaded in part by student blockades of railway tracks, offered
60 percent fare discounts on special trains to Paris for today's
protest.
   At least two local politicians - in the distant cities of
Grenoble, on the edge of the Alps, and Pau, near the Spanish border
- arranged travel for protesters from their cities.
   The students assembled at the Place de la Bastille, where
revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison 201 years ago and
marched toward the Champs Elysees.
   Minimal violence has accompanied the protests. Youths described
by student leaders as provocateurs have hurled stones at police and
smashed store windows on a few occasions.
   Many sidewalk cafes along the march route were closed as a
precaution, and police said two youths were arrested after some
street vendors were robbed.
   Pierre Verbrugghe, the Paris police chief, had ordered his
officers to avoid confrontation today, prompting allegations from
police unions that he was turning the force into ``mere
bystanders.''
   Today, scores of off-duty members of a major police union,
wearing civilian clothes, joined student leaders at the head of the
march and offered to assist in any negotiations with uniformed
police.
   Several major associations of teachers and parents have endorsed
the student goals. Teachers' unions plan to send representatives to
the march.
   ``We've accepted an invitation from the students,'' said Yannick
Simbron, secretary-general of the Federation of National Education,
one of the unions. ``The problems they are raising are those we've
been raising for a long time.''
   Surprising unity has developed between the two main student
factions, one led by hard-line leftists and the other aligned with
an anti-racism group. They decided to march together today rather
than form two processions.
   The protests began with student strikes in the gritty northern
suburbs of Paris after the gang rape of a girl in a school lavatory
and assaults on several teachers. Protesters complained of drug
trafficking, theft and extortion at schools.
   ``We're totally left to ourselves; it's the law of the jungle,''
a 16-year-old protester from Versailles told the magazine
L'Evenement.
   Protesters want more government spending to improve security,
replace substandard facilities, modernize curriculums and hire more
teachers. Many high schools have more than 35 students per class.
   In negotiations with Education Minister Lionel Jospin, student
leaders also have demanded greater freedom of expression and
assembly.
   Jospin says the protesters gradually are complying with his
request to be more specific in their demands. On Thursday, he
promised to push for a swift reassessment of high school education
and said: ``The students naturally must be heard and included in
these discussions.''
   Most protesters come from relatively low-income families, and
many are children of immigrants. They view education as the key to
advancement, and resent a seemingly second-class treatment of
schools in the high-rise slums that ring many major cities.
   The government has proposed increasing the education budget by 9
percent in 1991, which would outpace an overall budget rise of 4.3
percent and mark the first time education has been given more money
than defense.
   Students worry that improvements won't come quickly enough to
help them win university admission or decent jobs.
   Their protests have posed a dilemma for the governing Socialist
Party and particularly for President Francois Mitterrand, who has
enjoyed strong support among youth since taking office in 1981.
   Mitterrand has stayed on the sidelines, but faces increasing
pressure to intervene or risk alienating his young supporters.
   ``What have we done, in 10 years, with the immense hope the
election of Francois Mitterrand raised?'' asked Jean Poperen, a
Socialist leader. ``We haven't changed this society enough, and it
is in the process of taking revenge.''

<HEAD>Iraq Sets Conditons For Attending Proposed Peace Summit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Chinese official meeting with

<TEXT>
   Iraq has said it might attend a proposed Arab summit aimed at
avoiding war in the Persian Gulf, but only if the meeting also
deals with the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   King Hassan of Morocco proposed the emergency summit on Sunday
as a ``last chance'' for peace.
   There were new signs, meanwhile, of cracks in the alliance
against Iraq. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak was quoted today as
saying that Egyptian soldiers will not enter Iraq even if U.S. and
other troops attack.
   He said his troops could, however, enter Kuwait as a
peacekeeping force.
   At the same time, the European Community said it would urge
Baghdad to accept a U.N.-brokered solution concerning the hundreds
of Westerners held by Iraq. The EC wants countries negotiating
hostage deals with Iraq to work together and thereby prevent
tensions among nations in the anti-Iraq alliance.
   Meanwhile, an Arab summit attended by Iraq appeared possible.
   On Sunday, Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council said Iraq
would attend the summit under three conditions. Those were that
Baghdad be consulted in advance on the agenda, that the timing and
location be chosen so Saddam could attend, and that the agenda
include not just the gulf crisis but all Middle East issues -
including the Palestinian question.
   The council, led by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, also
suggested it would not allow certain topics to be discussed. It did
not specify which ones.
   ``The proposed summit should not be part of efforts to prepare
the political theater as a cover for American aggression against
Iraq and the Arab nation,'' the statement said.
   In Tunis, the Palestine Liberation Organization issued a
statement saying it agreed with King Hassan's initiaive.
   Saddam has long demanded that a solution to the crisis be linked
to the Palestinian issue. He made the offer shortly after his Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait.
   King Hassan suggested that the summit be held in Rabat, the
Morrocan capital, in a week. But he said he would attend a summit
wherever it might be held.
   Morocco, outspoken among Arab nations in condemning the Iraqi
invasion, has committed more than 1,200 soldiers to the U.S.-led
multinational force based in Saudi Arabia.
   In an interview with British television, Saddam again urged
dialogue on the crisis and said he did not believe the world was
united against him.
   The major powers and ``a number of countries'' are lined up
against Baghdad, Saddam acknowledged. ``But to say that the world
is unified against Iraq is indeed not a correct thing to say.
   ``In the statements of the U.S. and Britain, they themselves are
voicing their concern that the unity - so-called unity against Iraq
- is perhaps ... suffering from a split,'' Saddam said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III received assurances from
key allies last week that they will accept nothing short of an
unconditional Iraqi pullout.
   However, officials said China, France and the Soviet Union
reportedly expressed concern that Washington might attack Iraqi
forces without giving the U.N.-ordered trade embargo enough of a
chance.
   There were also signs of cracks in the Arab alliance against
Iraq. When Baker visited Cairo last week, a senior U.S. official
said the United States is confident that Egypt would fight
alongside U.S. forces if war broke out.
   But asked by his party's newspaper, Mayo, whether Egypt would
send troops to Iraq following a U.S.-led attack, Mubarak said:
   ``No, we have nothing to do with Iraq.'' But if the anti-Iraq
allies invaded Kuwait, he said, ``We do not mind at all entering
Kuwait as peacekeeping forces ... although I do not hope for this
day at all.''
   In Washington, the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee said the Bush administration must have the
support of the American people if the nation is to go to war with
Iraq.
   ``The last thing we need is to have a war over there, a bloody
war, and have American boys being sent and brought back in body
bags and yet not have the American people behind them,'' said Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga. ``We've gone that route one time. We don't need to
do it again.''
   In Brussels, meanwhile, European Community foreign ministers
said they would step up pressure on Iraq to open talks with a U.N.
envoy on the fate of hundreds of Westerners that Baghdad is
holding. They said they would encourage about 40 nations to
pressure Sadam into accepting mediation by such an envoy.
   In other developments:
   -Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China met today with Saddam in
Baghdad. A Chinese diplomat said talks focused on how to achieve a
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.
   -In Tokyo, Foreign leaders gathered for Emperor Akihito's
enthronement were pessimistic about a peaceful solution to the gulf
crisis, an aide to Vice President Dan Quayle said on condition of
anonymity.

   A woman who tracked her husband to a rendezvous
with an alleged paramour was slain when she broke into the wrong
house, officials said.
   Priscilla Brayboy was shot to death by a homeowner early Sunday
when she forced her way into a house where she believed her husband
was having an affair, said Harris County Sheriff's Department Sgt.
Bruce Williams.
   Williams said Mrs. Brayboy, 32, and a friend drove down a
northern Harris County street looking for her husband, Joe Brayboy.
When the women spotted a gray Volvo parked in a driveway on the
street, Mrs. Brayboy thought it belonged to her husband.
   When Mrs. Brayboy knocked on the door, a woman answered,
Williams said. Mrs. Brayboy, believing her husband was inside,
began to force her way into the house.
   A man inside the home heard the commotion and armed himself with
a shotgun, Williams said. As Mrs. Brayboy lunged through the door,
the man shot her, the officer said.
   When Mrs. Brayboy's friend saw what had happened, she ran down
the street screaming and noticed another gray Volvo parked in
another driveway a few houses away. The woman went to that house
and found Joe Brayboy inside, Williams said.
   Mrs. Brayboy was taken by helicopter to Hermann Hospital, where
she was pronounced dead.
   The homeowner who did the shooting was questioned and released,
Williams said. The case will be referred to a grand jury.

   Military investigators have tentatively
determined that the shooting death of a Marine in Saudi Arabia last
Friday was accidental, a Marine Corps spokesman said today.
   The victim, identified as James B. Cunningham, 22, of Glendale,
Ariz., was killed in his sleep by a single bullet fired from
another Marine's M16 rifle at a rear-area tent camp in eastern
Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said.
   Cunningham was a member of the 3rd Marine Regiment deployed from
Hawaii as part of Operation Desert Shield.
   A Marine Corps spokesman, Warrant Officer Randy Gaddo, said a
preliminary investigation found no evidence of foul play. The
investigation is continuing, he said.
   Gaddo said two other Marines were in the tent at the time of the
shooting. He said the rifle of one Marine discharged as he was
leaving the tent, striking the victim as he lay sleeping. It
happened at 3:10 p.m. Saudi time last Friday.
   If the incident is officially declared an accident, it would
bring to 44 the number of accidental deaths during Desert Shield,
which began Aug. 7.

   Trans World Airlines Inc. has offered to buy Pan
Am Corp. if Pan Am's deal to sell key New York-to-London routes to
United Airlines' parent falls through.
   TWA chairman Carl Icahn said late Sunday he had proposed
offering about $150 million in cash plus securities with a face
value of $300 million for struggling Pan Am.
   Icahn said in a telephone interview that Pan Am Chairman Thomas
Plaskett had asked him to make an offer in case Pan Am's talks with
UAL Corp. fail. Pan Am has proposed selling UAL important routes
between New York and London as part of a $400 million deal.
   Although TWA is considered healthier than Pan Am, both have been
hurt by rising fuel prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait
and fewer passengers since the economy started weakening.
   If TWA buys Pan Am, duplicated routes like those to London's
Heathrow airport would be sold, Pan Am said. TWA and Pan Am are the
only two U.S. airlines flying into Heathrow.
   Icahn's proposal, contained in a letter delivered to Plaskett
late Friday, proposed Pan Am shareholders receive $1 per share in
cash and securities with a face value of $2 per share. The
securities, either preferred stock or promissary notes, could bring
different market prices.
   Pan Am's stock closed at $1.62{ Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange; in early trading today, it rose 12{ cents to $1.75.
   Pan Am said in a statement it was still working on the route
sale to United, but the deal could be called off if not completed
by Wednesday.
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins wouldn't comment Sunday on the TWA
proposal.
   Icahn's letter also proposed buying the Pan Am Shuttle, which
flies between Boston, New York and Washington, by the end of the
year. TWA's proposal to buy the rest of the company is open through
Friday.
   The Wall Street Journal reported recently that Pan Am's pilots
might be willing to pay $150 million to $200 million for the
shuttle alone. Subtracting other elements of Pan Am's deal with
United, the London routes would be worth about $290 million.
   TWA last month announced 430 layoffs from its work force of
33,000 to cope with rising jet fuel prices and the economic
downturn. TWA also said it would stop hiring and training new
pilots and flight attendants.
   TWA, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., earned $103.4 million in the
second quarter of the year, but that included one-time gains from
the sales of assets totalling $160.2 million. In the second quarter
of 1989, the airline lost $4.4 million.
   Earlier this month, Pan Am, based in New York, cited blamed
rising jet fuel costs for a loss of $29.1 million, or 19 cents per
share, during the third quarter. In the same period last year the
airline lost $18 million, or 12 cents a share.

   The governing party today claimed
overwhelming victories in two major state elections that tested the
impact of reforms in the country and the long-dominant party
itself.
   But the opposition charged that the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, resorted to old-fashioned fraud during Sunday's vote
for state and local officials in Hidalgo and Mexico states.
   Unofficial results from party poll watchers continued to trickle
in today but official results, by law, will not be released for a
week.
   PRI has been scrambling to renovate itself since the 1988
elections, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari won election
with the narrowest margin in modern Mexican history.
   Salinas has pushed the country to sudden free-market reforms
that have jolted the long-sluggish economy. He has overseen a new
election law and party reforms billed as more democratic.
   The reforms included state primary elections to choose local
candidates, doing away with the appointment of candidates by party
leaders.
   PRI officials said they appeared to be even or ahead in all of
the 121 municipalities of Mexico state. They also claimed victory
in the 22 local Hidalgo races they said were decided.
   But the conservative National Action Party claimed it was
leading in at least some parts of Mexico state.
   The leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution said it had won
at least one victory in Hidalgo and had been robbed of others.
   ``It was a normal election, within the common and ongoing
frauds, but normal,'' said Francisco Ortiz Mendoza, an election
official of the Popular Socialist Party. He was quoted by the
Excelsior news agency.
   The state of Mexico is the country's most populous, with more
than 10 million people and 4.5 million voters. It borders Mexico
City, but does not include it.
   Hidalgo, just northeast of Mexico state, is a mountainous zone
with a few sizable cities and many small villages.
   Reporters touring Mexico state on Sunday found polling places
generally orderly and peaceful, and often empty. Party estimates of
turnout hovered around 30 percent.
   The election commission in Mexico state said it had received
complaints of irregularities in only 84 voting places, 2.3 percent
of the total.
   Javier Paz Zarza, spokesman for the National Action Party in
Mexico state, alleged that armed men also seized ballot boxes in
Chimalhuacan.
   In Hidalgo state, PRI spokesman Marco Antonio Gonzalez said the
party was leading in the 22 results so far available. The state has
84 municipalities.

   Israeli leaders have agreed to hold talks with
a U.N. envoy as a compromise with a Security Council demand for an
investigation into last month's Temple Mount killings, Israel radio
said today.
   The radio quoted Foreign Minister David Levy as announcing the
decision during a closed-door session of Parliament's Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
   The ministry declined official comment on the report, but a
government official confirmed Israel had worked out an
understanding with the United States to accept the compromise. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The proposal called for a special U.N. envoy to visit Israel but
not in connection with two Security Council resolutions censuring
Israel and demanding a probe, the official said.
   The compromise was aimed at hading off threats by the U.N.
Security Council to take further measures against Israel. Earlier,
the Council criticized excessive force by police in the Oct. 8
riots on the Temple Mount.
   Twenty Palestinians were killed and more than 140 wounded when
police opened fire on Arab stone-throwers at the site, which is
holy to both Moslems and Jews.
   The United States, which refused to use its veto to block a
resolution condemning Israel for the shootings, has been pushing
Israel to accept a U.N. investigation into the slayings.
   Israel rejected such a probe, saying it could call into question
its sovereignty over east Jerusalem, which it captured from Jordan
in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed.
   Most Western countries do not recognize Israeli rule of the
eastern sector, where the Temple Mount is located.
   Levy's reported statement came after a possible compromise was
discussed at Sunday's weekly Cabinet meeting, but no decision was
announced.
   The radio quoted Levy as saying today that Israel would accept a
U.N. envoy in a compromise with the United States.
   The official said Israeli leaders would meet with Jean Claude
Aimee, an envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
who visited Israel in June to discuss the Palestinian issue.
   The official stressed that an ``understanding,'' rather than a
formal agreement, was reached with Washington. He said Israel was
still waiting to hear if Perez de Cuellar had accepted the
compromise.
   ``We do hope that on their side the American administration will
now work to remove the subject from the Security Council agenda,''
the official said.
   An Israeli daily newspaper reported, meanwhile, that President
Bush warned American Jewish leaders last week to stop objecting to
weapons sales to Saudi Arabia or he would tell the American people
``who is with us and who is against us.''
   The Yedioth Ahronoth said Bush spoke out of concern that Jewish
opposition to his proposal to sell the Saudis $20 billion worth of
equipment and weapons could harm the multinational alliance in the
Persian Gulf.
   The comments were contained in a report compiled by Israel's
ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval, a copy of which was placed
on Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's desk Sunday, the newspaper said.
   Israel has traditionally been outspoken in opposing American
arms shipments to enemy Arab states, but has kept quiet over the
latest proposed sale because of the gulf crisis.
   Jewish leaders in the United States, however, have quietly tried
to persuade senators and congressmen to veto the deal.
   Bush, speaking in a closed-door meeting with Jewish leaders,
expressed anger at their lobbying against his proposal, Yedioth
Ahronoth said.
   ``The subject on the agenda is the security of American soldiers
in Saudi Arabia,'' Bush reportedly told them. ``If you object to
the weapons deal with Saudi Arabia, I will appeal directly to the
American public and explain who is with us and who is against us.''

   The party of Yugoslavia's reformist
premier, Ante Markovic, held a slight lead over ruling Communists
in unofficial returns from free elections in the Macedonian
republic, officials said today.
   An official of the state electoral commission, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said initial figures put Markovic's party
just ahead of the Communists in Sunday's voting. He said he could
not provide specific figures.
   Stojan Andov, the head of the Alliance of Reformist Forces in
Macedonia, also said the party was doing well. Andov himself won a
seat from the capital, Skopje, an aide said.
   The Alliance advocates market economics and keeping Yugoslavia
united.
   The polling in the southern republic, Yugoslavia's poorest, was
viewed as a crucial test for Markovic, whose party was competing in
an election for the first time.
   A good showing in the ballot in Macedonia would significantly
boost the party's chances in elections in the states of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro and Serbia in the next weeks.
   Markovic's popularity grew steadily after he became federal
premier in March 1989. But his reforms and efforts to keep together
Yugoslavia's fragile federation of six republics have been
undermined by political squabbling and increasing ethnic tensions.
   Official results were not expected until Thursday. Runoff
elections will be held Nov. 25 in districts where no one received
50 percent of the vote.
   Turnout was estimated at 75 percent of the 1.37 million eligible
voters.
   Petar Gosev, the head of the former Communist Party, recently
renamed the Party of Democratic Change, was reported by Skopje
television to have won a majority in his Skopje district.
   Gosev strongly supports Markovic's policies and has said he
would be prepared to form a coalition with Markovic's party.
   A coalition of nationalist, right-wing parties charged that
there had been widespread electoral fraud during Sunday's voting,
and demanded it be declared invalid. Public opinion polls had
indicated that the four parties that make up the coalition were
likely to do poorly in the balloting.
   Another contender in the elections was the mainly ethnic
Albanian Party of Democratic Prosperity. People of Albanian origin
account for more than 20 percent of Macedonia's population of 2.2
million.

   A conservative, born-again Christian
jumped to an early lead in Guatemala's presidential election today,
but it appeared that the contest would have to be decided by a
runoff in January.
   Jorge Serrano Elias, 45, whose resume ranges from close
collaboration with one of Guatemala's last dictators to a stint on
a national commission promoting democracy and peace talks with
leftist rebels, led with 28.09 percent of the vote with about 21
percent of the total counted.
   If none of the 12 candidates gets more than 50 percent of the
vote, there will be a runoff Jan. 6. It would be the first time in
Guatemala's history that one elected civilian has taken office from
another.
   Results broadcast by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal gave
newspaper publisher Jorge Carpio Nicolle 23.17 percent of the vote
and former Guatemala Mayor Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen 22.37 percent.
   The candidate of the incumbent Christian Democrats, Alfonso
Cabrera, had 13.68 percent. The other candidates shared the other
12 percent.
   The winner will inherit a 30-year-old civil war, a bankrupt
government, 60 percent inflation and an epidemic of street crime
and human rights abuse.
   The trend in Sunday's balloting represents a sharp repudiation
of the corrupt and inept Christian Democractic administration of
President Vinicio Cerezo, who was barred by the constitution from
running for re-election.
   Election officials say the turnout appears to be about 60
percent of 3.3 million registered voters.
   That would be less than in 1985 but more than some observers had
predicted.
   Guatemalans also were electing a vice president, 116 members of
a new congress, 20 delegates to a new Central American parliament
and 300 mayors.
   Carpio, who has been campaigning for years, positioned himself
as the centrist and assembled a broad coalition ranging from an
arch-right running mate to disaffected socialists.
   Arzu, 44, campaigned as a no-nonsense pragmatist who would run
Guatemala like a business enterprise.
   He headed the national tourism agency at a time when Guatemala
was facing international censure because of its human rights
record.
   As mayor, he gained high marks for public works projects. He is
from a wealthy old Guatemalan family and had the backing of some of
the most conservative elements of the private sector.
   Serrano, a 45-year-old engineer, came in third in the 1985
presidential election and polls had suggested he would fare no
better this time.
   But his old boss, retired Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, was forced to
withdraw due to laws banning former coup instigators from running
for election. That threw an important chunk of votes from the
religious right into Serrano's lap.
   Rios Montt is an evangelical preacher who presided over some of
the worst human rights abuses in Guatemala's bloody history until
he was deposed in 1983.
   He had stormed to the head of the crowded field this year on a
tough law-and-order platform that hit a hugely responsive chord in
nation bowed by crime and government corruption.
   A televised debate with Cerezo also gave Serrano a boost in
capital, political observers say. Cerezo debated on behalf of his
party; by law, presidents here serve one five-year term.
   Serrano headed Rios Montt's advisory council in 1982 and 1983
and helped draft a set of electoral laws. His campaign literature
says the job showed Serrano's ``faith in democracy.''
   After the Rios Montt years, Serrano went on to carve out his
own, more mainstream niche. He was an important member of the
National Reconciliation Commission, created to work toward
implementing the 1987 Central American accords on regional peace
and democratization.
   The campaign was long and marred by violence and rumors of
coups, but election day was calm.
   The federal human rights ombudsman, who has logged 264 killings
and 176 disappearances this year, said the the country was
``totally normal,'' without violence or significant reports of
electoral problems.
   Five years of democracy has done little to improve everday life
in Guatemala, and the challenges that will face the winner are
immense.
   Seven out of every 10 Guatemalans live in dire poverty and half
cannot read or write.
   The new president also will have to contend with an immensely
powerful military and one of the most conservative private sectors
in the hemisphere.
   On the bright side, peace talks have recently begun in the
30-year-old civil war that has left 100,000 dead and more than
40,000 missing - almost all at the hands of the military or
right-wing death squads.
   The election season brought an outbreak of assassinations,
disappearances and death threats that put Guatemala back on the
international human rights agenda.
   It has been an embarrassment for the United States, which helped
provoke 30 years of brutal dictatorship and civil war with leftist
rebels by backing a military coup against a liberal civilian
government in 1954.
   The United States has poured nearly $1 billion in aid into
Guatemala since civilian rule was restored in 1985, hoping to
create a showcase for free-market democracy.

   A mentally handicapped 11-year-old girl missing
since October returned home safely this weekend, and a teen-ager
living down the block from her home was charged, police said.
   Until April Hall came home Sunday, authorities did not know if
she had run away or had been abducted.
   But police said they now believe she was being held just a block
from her family's North Side home in the apartment of 17-year-old
Francisco Flores. He was arrested Sunday and charged with
kidnapping.
   The child, last seen by her family on Oct. 23, left Flores'
apartment and went home while he was asleep, police said, adding
she appeared to be in good condition.
   ``Her school said earlier they were afraid she would go with
anyone who said, `Come in,' and they were 100 percent correct,''
said Lt. Edmund Beazley.
   The girl, described as having the mentality of a 5-year-old,
provided a sketchy account of how she spent the time, Beazley said.
   The girl's disappearance prompted door-to-door searches and the
distribution of numerous fliers bearing her photograph.

   Hundreds of angry farmers used tractors, bales of
hay and barricades of burning tires to block traffic Monday on
major highways near everal cities in central France.
   One group of farmers intercepted a Belgian truck carrying
imported beef, and seized all of the eight-ton cargo except a
portion destined for charity organizations.
   The protests were the latest in a six-month campaign by farmers
who contend that the government is not protecting them against
low-priced meat imports and the effects of drought. A decision last
week by the European Community to reduce state subsidies to farmers
also has drawn criticism.
   The blockades were mounted for four hours on several roads in
the Limousin, Poitou-Charentes and Auvergne regions of west-central
and central France. An estimated 2,000 farmers were involved.

   The quake registered 4.2 on the Richter scale, and is believed
to have been centered near Bohinjska Bistrica, in the northwest

   It struck late Sunday evening, and was followed by a serious of
minor tremors, Tanjug said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on

   Mount said the Italian Renaissance-style theater, closed in

   Yannis Ritsos, an internationally
acclaimed poet and staunch Communist who had spent years in
detention under right-wing governments, has died, his family said
Monday. He was 81.
   Ritsos died at home late Sunday, a nephew said. No cause of
death was given, but Ritsos had suffered from various ailments
recently.
   Several Athens dailies reported that Ritsos had become
despondent with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe over
the past year and had shut himself off from society.
   Ritsos was one of Greece's most prolific and popular poets. His
work, ranging from long ideological pieces to personal lyricism,
gained a wide following when it was set to music by composers such
as Mikis Theodorakis.
   He was detained or sent into internal exile for many years under
right-wing governments and the 1967-74 military dictatorship. He
refused to compromise his beliefs for the sake of his personal
freedom.
   Harilaos Florakis, president of the Greek Communist Party, of
which Ritsos was a member, said Monday:
   ``We are filled with great sorrow. Yannis Ritsos identified
himself with the best that modern Greece had to offer.''
   Ritsos won the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize in 1978 and
numerous literary awards, many from Eastern bloc countries.
   He was nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature several
times.
   His
   ``But imagine doing that in any other country at that time, or
today in Nepal. The money would be gone in no time.''
   One of Hagen's most treasured possessions is his trekking
permit, a document now issued to tens of thousands of tourists

   But Hagen's slip of paper carries a unique distinguishing mark -

   Thousands of celebrants filled the
streets of this African country on Monday for the crowning of the
new king of Lesotho.
   Formerly known as Prince Mohato, the new king is the 27-year-old
son of exiled King Moshoeshoe II, who was dethroned last week by
the head of the country's ruling military council, Maj. Gen. Justin
Lekhanya.
   Queen Regent Mamohato, the new king's mother, attended Monday's
ceremony, held beneath a statue of King Moshoeshoe I, the new
king's great-great-grandfather.
   No royal name has been given the new king, but he was expected
to be called King Letsie III. He will be the constitutional monarch
and head of state, but with no executive powers.
   Moshoeshoe was forced into exile in March following
disagreements with Lekhanya, who seized power in a 1986 coup.
   Lekhanya gave the king some executive authority. But in
February, he fired most of Moshoeshoe's supporters from the
government and told the king to leave when he refused to approve
replacements.
   Last month, Lekhanya invited Moshoeshoe back from exile in
London. But he said last week the king had set unacceptable
conditions for returning and therefore had been stripped of his
title and powers.
   Lekhanya said one condition set by Moshoeshoe was dissolution of
the government.
   It was not clear if Moshoeshoe would return to Lesotho.
   Lekhanya said the deposed king had been granted amnesty, and a
government news release Monday said none of Moshoeshoe's property
would be confiscated.
   Lesotho is a mountainous, land-locked country of about 1.5
million people completely surrounded by South Africa. Lesotho
gained independence from Britain in 1966.
   Lekhanya has promised to return Lesotho to civilian rule in
1992.

<HEAD>Kermit Will Return, Henson Family Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kermit the Frog, the fuzzy green alter ego of
the late muppeteer Jim Henson, will live on with someone new
supplying his voice.
   Kermit will be among the characters appearing in ``The Muppets
Celebrate Jim Henson'' on CBS Nov. 21.
   The amiable amphibian has been a mainstay of the Muppets for 35
years. Henson, who directed his motions and supplied his voice,
died of pneumonia in May.
   ``When Jim was alive, he said if anything happened to him,
Kermit must go on right away,'' Henson's widow, Jane, told TV
Guide, the magazine reports in its Nov. 17 issue. ``Because of
Kermit's significant place, Jim had essentially chosen who he
thought could do it. But we don't want to say who it is before the
show.
   ``The performer needs time. Kermit won't come back so strong at
first. Then little by little, he will get his whole personality
back.''
   Young viewers ensured Kermit's return.
   ``We found the kids really wanted to keep Kermit going,'' said
Henson's daughter, Cheryl. ``It was a touchy thing. They were sorry
Jim had died and wanted to know if the Muppets could die.
   ``We thought that the Muppets were characters, not people, and
that it was much better to say that they don't die.''

<HEAD>Bishops Voice Reservations About Military Force in Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with bishops calling for limitations of military force
in Gulf. EDITS throughout. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops today
called for sharp limitations on any use of military force by the
United States in the Persian Gulf.
   They said church principles ruled out any tactics that would
target civilian lives, adding that would mean any Gulf conflict
would have to be a ``limited war.''
   The bishops urged that the United States ``stay the course of
persistent, peaceful and determined pressure against Iraq'' for a
non-violent solution.
   The action came in the opening session of the annual fall
meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   After lengthy discussion, they voted 249-15 to endorse a letter
about the Gulf crisis written by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger
Mahony, head of the conference's international affairs committee.
   The letter was sent last week to Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   It said resorting to war would violate principles set down in
the church's ``just war'' theory by jeopardizing many lives,
raising serious moral questions and undermining the international
solidarity against Iraq.
   After affirming the letter's position, the bishops also voted
126-118 to modify their agenda to hold a special closed session
later on the Gulf crisis.
   Earlier today, the president of the conference said the church
is ``in a time of testing'' for the priesthood.
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati told about 300
bishops that the clergy seems to be in a ``period of special
challenge.'' Seminary enrollments, down to about a fourth of their
one-time level, have yet to begin climbing from the slump, he said.
   ``Our priests are fewer and more is being demanded of them than
ever before,'' he said in his address opening the bishops' annual
fall meeting. ``Suspicions have been raised about their
faithfulness to their commitments.
   ``There have been sad lapses, publicly known, touching even our
own bishops' conference. There are consequent morale problems among
some of our priests, perhaps even among some of us.''
   Pilarczyk appeared to be referring to sexual lapses among some
priests, including a resigned Georgia bishop, but he did not cite
specifics.
   He pointed out that a world synod of bishops, which met last
month at the Vatican, strongly affirmed that the priesthood should
go only to those committed to celibacy.
   That has been a church rule since the Middle Ages, but with the
sharpening shortage of priests, many Catholics have pressed for a
priestly option on celibacy.
   Despite studies finding serious morale problems among clergy,
Pilarczyk told fellow prelates:
   ``We may be in a time of testing, a period of challenge, but I
know that, by and large, our priests are happy in their ministry
and are deeply appreciated by the people they serve.''
   As the bishops began their four-day meeting, a demonstration
``celebrating women'' was held outside, pressing for admission of
women to the priesthood. The Women's Ordination Conference said it
and about 200 other groups were cosponsoring the ``block party,''
including dancing, singing, poetry reading and public speaking.
   The bishops' meeting faced a batch of touchy issues. But action
has been postponed on the most volatile item - a proposed pastoral
teaching document on the role of women.
   That was to be discussed Thursday, but no action was planned.
   A draft proposal, drawn up in about six years of work and
hearings, was sharply criticized as contradictory and inconsistent
when it was unveiled earlier this year.
   It advocates equality for women, but would continue their
exclusion from ordination.
   Bishops decided to delay action on the issue after the Vatican
suggested prior consultation with bishops of other countries.

<HEAD>Conservative Urges `Open Criticism' of Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading conservative is urging Reagan
Republicans to ``decide if they will stand against'' President Bush
as Theodore Roosevelt's followers stood against William Howard Taft
in the ``Bull Moose'' campaign of 1912.
   Bush has betrayed former President Reagan's principles just as
Taft strayed from Roosevelt's, says Heritage Foundation Vice
President Burton Yale Pines.
   ``As in 1912, the responsible response to a party leader who
betrays the party cannot be silence; it must be open criticism,
possibly opposition and maybe even rebellion,'' Pines writes in a
forthcoming article in the foundation's magazine, Policy Review.
   Foundation President Edwin Fuelner Jr., in calling attention to
the article, wrote, ``If history truly does repeat itself, then
George Bush could become a general without an army in the fall of
1992.''
   Pines put it this way: ``Bush's very poor showing in this
November's congressional elections is merely the warning tremor of
an approaching political earthquake. ... If Bush and his advisors
keep to their current course, they are asking for the one-term
presidency of William Howard Bush.''
   Just as Reagan left the White House with high approval ratings
in 1989 after two terms in office, Roosevelt enjoyed immense
popularity when he stepped down in 1909 after nearly as long. He
praised Taft lavishly, just as Reagan praised Bush.
   He split with Taft, however, as the new president moved away
from Roosevelt's free trade policies toward protectionism.
   After a 1910 midterm election that was a disaster for the
Republicans, Roosevelt unsuccessfully challenged Taft for the 1912
GOP nomination and then ran against Taft in a campaign that got its
name when he told reporters he felt ``as strong as a bull moose.''
   The split in Republican ranks thrust Democrat Woodrow Wilson
into the White House.
   Pines equates the Taft-Roosevelt split over trade with what he
calls ``the betrayals of the Bush administration'' and ``the
economic and other disasters toward which Bush and his top advisers
are driving the nation.''
   Pines is not specific in his criticisms, but conservatives have
generally lambasted Bush for abandoning his campaign pledge not to
raise taxes.
   Pines concedes there are differences between 1912 and 1992. For
one, even if he wanted to, Reagan is now prohibited by the
Constitution from being elected president a third time. For
another, Roosevelt was a progressive Republican, not a
conservative.
   There are other differences the writer doesn't mention.
   For one, the Democrats picked up just one Senate seat and nine
House seats last week. That was bad for the Republicans, but
nothing like the debacle of 1910, when GOP House seats dropped from
219 to 161.
   For another, Reagan has voiced no criticism of his successor and
recently said Bush ``is doing very well in what is needed.''
   Despite the differences, Pines argues that the question, ``Do we
bolt the party?'' must be faced.
   ``The time is at hand for conservatives to decide if they will
stand against their party's leader,'' he wrote.
   ``Just as the legions of Roosevelt supporters turned on Taft for
betraying Roosevelt's hard-won victories, so are Ronald Reagan's
legions tempted to turn on Bush.''

<HEAD>Former Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne Officially Launches Campaign for
Old Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jane Byrne today officially launched her campaign
for mayor of Chicago, an office she occupied from 1979 until she
was defeated in her 1983 re-election bid by the late Harold
Washington.
   Byrne told reporters she was challenging incumbent Mayor Richard
M. Daley, a Democrat. But she stopped short of saying she was
running for the Democratic nomination.
   Political pundits, including outgoing Republican Gov. James R.
Thompson, insist it will be difficult to unseat Daley whether she
runs as a Democrat or as an independent. The mayor has not
announced whether he'll run again but is expected to.
   Daley was out of town and unvailable for comment, and his
office said no one else there was immediately available to give a
reaction to Byrne's announcement.
   Byrne said she was running because Daley has not been effective
in fighting crime and tackling public health issues.
   Byrne was elected mayor in 1979, defeating Michael Bilandic in a
primary upset stemming in part from voter anger over delays in
cleaning streets after a major snowstorm.
   She was defeated by Washington, the city's first black mayor, in
1983 and lost the nomination to Washington again in 1987. She also
lost a bid to become the Democratic nominee for Cook County Clerk
in 1988.
   Washington died in late 1987. Daley, son of the late mayor
Richard J. Daley, was elected to fill his unexpired term last year.

   Attorneys for Manuel Noriega and Cable News Network
agreed today to cool off their constitutional showdown, at least
until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the issue of tape-recorded
conversations.
   Under the agreement, Noriega will not ask for contempt penalties
as long as CNN continues to refrain from broadcasting tapes between
the deposed Panamanian leader and his lawyers.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler endorsed the deal, but once
again warned CNN, noting that over the weekend the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta had backed his original gag
order.
   ``If you play any tapes in violation of my order, you are
violating not only my order, but also the appeals court order,''
Hoeveler said.
   CNN's attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the
deal, but had the right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they
did not include conversations with his lawyers. The judge agreed.
   In Atlanta, where the network is based, CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said that the network expects to file its appeal to the
Supreme Court later in the week.
   Constitutional law experts said the confrontation could become a
landmark case.
   CNN had defied an order Friday by Hoeveler by broadcasting an
excerpt in which the deposed Panamanian dictator spoke in Spanish
with a secretary for defense lawyer Frank Rubino.
   CNN decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the
excerpt early Saturday, Haworth said. Later Saturday, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's ruling.
   The appeals court also told CNN to give the seven tapes to the
Miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would
endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges. That order was also stayed by today's agreement.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the invasion of Panama in December.
   Rubino asked Hoeveler to find the Atlanta-based network in
direct civil contempt and fine the network $300,000 for each time
it televised the tapes and each time it shows them in the future.
   CNN accused Hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself
from the case.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer who served as
co-counsel for The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, said
the CNN case could set precedent because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
   ``We've almost totally banned prior restraint,'' Abrams said.
``If the Supreme Court were to uphold the prior restraint order on
CNN, this would be the first time in our country's history that any
such court order had been affirmed by the court.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S. Supreme Court said
the government could not bar publication of classified documents
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather than
defy a lower court order.
   George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute of Media
Studies, called the CNN case ``an astonishing illustration of
censorship,'' but said the network was ``playing with blasting
caps'' by defying the judge's order.
   ``It's rare in general that a news organization of any kind -
broadcast, cable or print - would do such a thing,'' said Rahdert,
who represents several newspapers. ``It really falls into the
category of civil disobedience.''
   CNN president Tom Johnson said the case is a classic
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover.
   He said the district court and appeals court construed the case
as a conflict between the Sixth Amendment, which provides a
defendant a right to a fair trial, and the First Amendment, which
provides for freedom of the press.
   ``There's a more fundamental issue here: reporting the news of
possible governmental misconduct,'' Johnson said. ``If CNN can be
restrained from airing news about the Noriega tapes, so can any
news organization.''

<HEAD>U.N. Says Human Rights Abuses Persist In Salvador Since Jesuit
Slayings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Death squad slayings, summary executions
and torture have persisted in El Salvador since the massacre of six
Jesuit priests by soldiers a year ago, a U.N. human rights report
said Monday.
   The report blames both the U.S.-backed conservative government
and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels for the
continuation of violence.
   ``Thus far in 1990, government action against humanitarian,
trade union, peasants and other organizations has continued,'' said
Jose Antonio Pastor, a university professor from Spain who compiled
the annual report.
   Pastor concluded the leftist rebels also executed suspected
collaborators and used civilians as cover for their guerrilla
attacks.
   Summary killings by the rightists decreased since the San Jose
Agreement on Human Rights was signed July 26, Pastor said, and
rebel assassinations of suspected government collaborators ceased
after that date.
   Pastor's sharpest remarks were directed at the government, which
has been criticized for the fatal shootings of six Jesuit priests,
their housekeeper and her daughter by soldiers. They were killed
Nov. 16, 1989, a day after a guerrilla offensive began.
   In that case, he said, ``there seems to be a lack of cooperation
on the part of the armed forces, which has gone so far as the
destruction of important evidence.''
   Since the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero
during Mass in 1980, rightist death squads have seen the clergy as
fair game for attack.
   Right-wing elements of the military and government view the
Roman Catholic Church's advocacy of human rights and social justice
as a legal adjunct to the rebel effort to overthrow the system.
   ``It must be concluded that the practice of summary executions
by elements of the state apparatus, in particular members of the
armed forces, persisted in the first nine months of 1990,'' Pastor
said.
   Pastor counted 40 politically motivated summary executions of
civilians by security forces from January to August of 1990,
compared with 51 in the same time span in 1989, according to
figures from the Archdiocesan Legal Protection Office.
   The office also listed 46 assassinations by death squads in
January through August 1990, compared with only 17 such slayings in
the same months of 1989. The Salvadoran government's Human Rights
Commission counted 42 summary killings by security forces in the
first eight months of 1990, compared with 68 in the same months of
1989. The government did not keep figures on death squad activity.
   The church recorded 12 assassinations by the rebels in the first
eight months of the year, compared with 30 during those months in
1989. The government counted 49 in the first eight months, compared
to 173 from January to August 1989.
   ``Cases of politically motivated disappearances of individuals
continue to be reported,'' he added, and said that rightist death
squads were probably behind some of them, as well as the
guerrillas.
   Torture of prisoners continued, Pastor found, with prisoners who
belong to political organizations or unions receiving the worst
treatment.
   ``Long periods of interrogation while being blindfolded and
without being able to sit down or relieve themselves, extensive
beatings, the occasional use of a hood which impedes breathing and
causes fainting, immersion of the head in tanks of water, electric
shocks, and threats to themselves or their families'' were common,
he said.
   Pastor concluded both the right-wing government of President
Alfredo Cristiani and the leftist rebels want to improve the human
rights situation in the country, but that abuses continue as the
war rages on.
   Rebels launched a civil war in 1979 that has killed at least
72,000 people, most of them civilians, claiming the government
represents an oligarchy of landowners and businesses.

   A scene in ``Rocky V'' between Sylvester
Stallone and his neophyte-actor son, 14-year-old Sage, may be left
on the cutting-room floor because it came too close to real life,
Stallone says.
   Stallone and his first wife, Sasha, divorced in 1985 and Sage
and his brother Seargeoh, 11, remained with their mother.
   ``I'm sure there's a residue of anger in Sage from when my
marriage broke up,'' Stallone told an interviewer in Redbook
magazine.
   In filming the new movie, ``there was one scene in which we both
became totally unglued,'' Stallone said.
   In the scene, Stallone's Rocky character told his son's
character ``that no matter what, I'll never desert him,'' he said.
   ``I really lost it in that scene,'' Stallone said. ``Then Sage
started to lose it because he'd never seen his father cry.
   ``It was all hitting too close to home, and I may take it out of
the movie because it's just too emotional.''

   CHICAGO (AP) - Playwright Arthur Miller says America's artists
are censoring their own works for the sake of government grants.
   Such self-censorship allows freedom to be ``killed without a
trace,'' Miller said Sunday at a daylong humanities festival called
``Expressions of Freedom,'' sponsored by the Illinois Humanities
Council.
   Miller, 75, whose works include the plays ``Death of a
Salesman'' and ``The Crucible,'' said the First Amendment is the
artist's ultimate weapon against censorship.
   ``It simply cuts through all the arguments and prohibits
Congress from infringing on our freedom of expression,'' said
Mille.
   ``Censorship is fear, and fear spreads,'' he said in the keynote
address. ``Censorship is the most futile of governmental
exercises.''

   Actress Shelley Fabares says Alzheimer's disease
stopped her mother from remembering that she would have preferred
suicide to suffering from the affliction that deteriorates the
brain.
   Fabares, currently appearing in the series ``Coach,'' said she
learned of her mother's preoccupation with the disease after she
had to take over her affairs.
   ``In taking over her papers, I discovered that she'd been making
donations to an Alzheimer's association for years,'' Fabares told
an interviewer for Redbook magazine.
   ``Mother once told my sister that if she ever found out she had
Alzheimer's, she would kill herself,'' Fabares said. ``Fortunately,
by the time she was diagnosed, she was too far gone to remember
what she'd said.''
   Her mother had lost the ability to speak lucidly before she
deteriorated to the point where she had to be institutionalized in
February, the actress said.
   ``One thing that was so painful for my sister and me was that
mother would get very close to our faces, scream at the top of her
lungs, then hit her cheeks and point inside her mouth and sob,''
Fabares said. ``You can't get a clearer communication than that of
`Help! I'm trapped and dying inside!'''

   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Best-selling author Tom Clancy, whose ``The
Hunt for Red October'' and other thrillers are noted for their
detail of military technology and combat maneuvers, says an end to
war is desirable and possible.
   ``There's no law of God or nature that says we have to have a
conflict anywhere,'' Clancy said Sunday.
   He is in Omaha through Tuesday to speak at a benefit for the
Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce and the Omaha Public Library
Foundation. He also is scheduled to tour Strategic Air Command
headquarters with Gen. John T. Chain, the SAC commander, as his
guide.
   Known for being publicity-shy, he reportedly consented to the
visit at the urging of Chamber of Commerce President Bob Bell, a
retired Navy vice admiral he met at the Pentagon.
   ``I got hustled very skillfully,'' he said. ``I don't mean to
seem ungracious but I have four kids. I'm just domestic, I'm sorry.
I think there were two weeks in this year I didn't have to leave
home for something.''

   DETROIT (AP) - A teacher once told Bruce Joel Rubin he'd never
cut it as a screenwriter.
   Now, the writer of ``Ghost,'' the year's top box office draw so
far, and ``Jacob's Ladder,'' last week's top draw, is looking
forward to his 30th Mumford High School reunion on Thanksgiving
weekend.
   ``He was always interested in movies and he was always a
storyteller. I think his real thrill will be meeting that teacher
who told him he'd never succeed,'' said Rubin's brother, Gary
Rubin, 44, a Detroit-area contractor.
   ``We are so excited. There's an article about him in our local
paper and one in the LA Times calling him the best writer of the
year, and I'm going broke buying newspapers,'' said his father, Jim
Rubin, 75, who now lives in West Bloomfield Township, north of
Detroit.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Singer-keyboardist Dr. John and the New
Orleans music he treasures are gaining new audiences after their
popularity waned since the 1970s.
   ``It's doing great with the Neville Brothers, Wynton and
Branford Marsalis, Harry Connick Jr. and the Dirty Dozen Band,''
said Dr. John. New Orleans is ``still it's own original place.''
   Although he had two hits in the early 1970s - ``Right Place,
Wrong Time'' and ``Such a Night'' - he decided to lay low after
being dropped by two record companies.
   Dr. John, born Mac Rebennack as the son of a New Orleans record
store owner, saw his ``In a Sentimental Mood'' album snare a Grammy
for a duet with singer Rickie Lee Jones on ``Makin' Whoopee.''
   His distinctive vocals also can be heard on a number of movie
soundtracks, including ``Bull Durham,'' and commercials.

<TEXT>
   The countdown toward this week's
launch of the space shuttle Atlantis proceeded without mishap
Monday after months of delays caused by fuel leaks and last-minute
problems with a spy satellite.
   NASA plans to send up Atlantis sometime between 6:30 p.m. and
10:30 p.m. EST Thursday, its fifth nighttime shuttle launch.
Because the Defense Department flight is secret, the exact time
will not be announced until nine minutes before liftoff.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said the countdown, which began
Sunday night, was proceeding smoothly. ``We don't have any
problems,'' she said.
   Weather forecasts were less favorable. Air Force meteorologists
predicted a 40 percent chance of good weather at launch time.
   As with the six previous Pentagon missions, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration refused to discuss the
shuttle's cargo or provide any flight details. The mission is
expected to last about four days, during which Atlantis' five
astronauts are to deploy a satellite that reportedly will spy on
Iraq and other areas.
   The mission originally was scheduled for July, but was delayed
indefinitely after Atlantis sprang dangerous hydrogen leaks similar
to those afflicting the shuttle Columbia. NASA temporarily grounded
the entire fleet in June.
   NASA tried three times in late August and September to launch
Columbia but it was forced to halt two countdowns because of
leaking hydrogen and another because of problems with the
astronomical observatory it was to carry.
   Fueling tests last month cleared both Columbia and Atlantis for
flight.
   NASA set Nov. 9 as Atlantis' launch date, but on Oct. 31 the Air
Force delayed the mission because of undisclosed trouble with the
spy satellite.
   NASA plans to launch Columbia two to three weeks after Atlantis'
flight. That will enable the space agency to close the year with
six shuttle flights, three fewer than planned.

   An outbreak of violence today forced police to halt
a march through Paris by more than 100,000 high school students,
the largest protest yet in a campaign for better education.
   The main throng of marchers was orderly, but several hundred
youths on the fringes of the crowd smashed windows, set fire to
cars, looted a clothing store, stoned police and attacked
journalists.
   Police made at least 20 arrests and used tear gas and a water
cannon to repel troublemakers, many of them masking their faces
with hoods or scarves.
   In dozens of smaller cities across France, more than 150,000
other students joined marches coinciding with the Paris protest.
Most were peaceful, but a dozen youths were arrested after
vandalism in the eastern city of Montbelaird.
   As the Paris marchers began to disperse at nightfall, Education
Minister Lionel Jospin emerged from talks with student leaders to
announce an ``emergency plan'' to improve France's high schools. He
said details would be worked out in negotiations involving students
and government officials.
   A separate delegation of 20 students met with President Francois
Mitterrand. One of the youths said after the 45-minute meeting that
Mitterrand agreed with their demands.
   Organizers claimed that 200,000 students joined the Paris march.
Other observers estimated the turnout at closer to 100,000.
   About two hours after the march began, Paris Police Chief Pierre
Verbrugghe demanded that student leaders order the protesters to
disperse. He said the throng would not be allowed to cross from the
Left Bank of the Seine River to the planned ending point on the
Champs Elysees.
   Beneath banners demanding more government spending on their
schools, the Paris marchers set out from the Place de la Bastille,
where revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison 201 years ago.
Their destination was the Rond Point, a traffic circle four miles
away on the Champs Elysees.
   Streets and subway stations along much of the route were closed
by police, paralyzing transportation in a large section of central
Paris.
   The dozens of previous student marches and rallies across France
over the past four weeks have been peaceful, except for sporadic
vandalism blamed by student leaders on provocateurs.
   Many sidewalk cafes along the march route were closed as a
precaution, and police said two youths were arrested after some
street vendors were robbed.
   Verbrugghe said he was deploying 5,000 officers to cope with the
march, but they were ordered to avoid force against anyone
demonstrating peacefully.
   Scores of off-duty members of a major police union, wearing
civilian clothes, joined student leaders at the head of the march
and offered to assist in any negotiations with uniformed police.
   Also among the marchers were officials of industrial trade
unions and several national teachers' associations.
   Throughout the morning, hundreds of youths poured out of trains
at Paris railway stations. In most cases, the out-of-town
protesters had either forced their way onto the trains without
paying or had obtained discounts of 60 to 70 percent after
blockading tracks at provincial stations last week.
   In Caen, students were allowed to board a train after being
asked to pay whatever they could afford.
   In Lyon, students rented an entire train with $480 raised
through public donations during recent protests. And in Grenoble, a
regional administrative council provided funds to carry about 1,000
students on a train to Paris.
   Students arriving in Paris found smiling policemen waiting for
them at improvised information booths, telling them where to
assemble for the march.
   The students want more government spending to improve security,
upgrade substandard facilities, modernize curriculums and hire more
teachers. Many high schools have more than 35 students per class.
They have also have demanded greater freedom of expression and
assembly.

   Newspaper carrier Johnny Gosch, missing
for more than eight years, would have been 21 Monday and his mother
says the pain of not knowing what happened to him gets worse with
time.
   Noreen Gosch's son disappeared Sept. 5, 1982, from a street near
his home just as he was about to begin delivering Sunday
newspapers.
   ``Most of the time, I'm really good. I distance myself from the
pain, I put it on the shelf,'' said Mrs. Gosch, of suburban West
Des Moines. ``But every so often, something will sneak in, a
memory, a song. Without realizing it, you're reduced to tears in
seconds, it hits so fast.
   ``I've been through a lot of losses, but it is different when
you don't have an answer.
   ``The longer it goes, you'd think it would be further removed
emotionally, but it kind of works the opposite.''
   ``We've missed all the years of him growing up, it's painful. We
were at a family gathering recently, and a lot of nieces and
nephews were there. There are a lot of them Johnny's age. It's real
hard going to someplace like that, you see everybody else's kid
grew up,'' she said.
   The most devastating news, she said, was when investigators
turned up a false alarm last spring - the body of a man bearing
identification of John Gosch was found in Mexico. But it turned out
the body was that of a man with the same name and age who had
disappeared from Tacoma, Wash., three years earlier.
   ``We came close to an answer, even though it would have been a
bad one. That was real tough. It was hard on us emotionally,'' she
said.
   In the months following Johnny's disappearance, the Gosches
raised tens of thousands of dollars to publicize the case and hire
private investigators.
   Mrs. Gosch also renewed her appeal for a Michigan man, released
from prison last year after serving time for defrauding the
Gosches, to contact the family about possible clues in the case.
   Robert Herman Meier of Bay City, Mich., contacted them several
years ago and asked for money in return for information on the
abduction. The Gosches, convinced that Meier was credible, gave him
$10,000.
   Meier later pleaded guilty to fraud and served about 18 months.
He as released from an Iowa prison about a year and a half ago. No
money was recovered.
   She said the state parole board will not give them information
on Meier's whereabouts, agreeing only to send him a letter inviting
him to contact the family.

   The nation's big cities need to organize their
plea to Washington like a political campaign, a group of mayors
said Monday at the start of Urban Summit 1990.
   ``It seems to us that we need to do a better job of packaging
the nature of our problems,'' said Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley,
one of more than 30 mayors attending the two-day summit in
Manhattan.
   Bradley was joined at a media briefing by San Diego Mayor
Maureen O'Connor and New York Mayor David Dinkins, who organized
the meeting to help find ways to solve the nation's urban problems.
   The summit is focusing on issues such as housing, AIDS
prevention and treatment, combating drug abuse, improving education
and paying for costly projects such as bridges and roads.
   The mayors complained that the federal government has mandated
programs at the local level without providing cities with the money
to pay for them.
   ``Over the last decade, we have lost about 26 percent of the
federal support which we once enjoyed,'' Bradley said. ``In
addition, more programs have been dumped on the cities. More
problems exist in those cities.
   ``So we've been hit with a double whammy.''
   Dinkins just last week announced that he intended to cut 5,400
city jobs to close a $388 million municipal budget gap.
   Bradley said the mayors are working to package their ideas and
present them in such a way that Congress and President Bush can't
ignore them.
   ``We think that we have to run this like a political campaign,''
he said. ``It has to be said over and over again until they finally
get the message.''
   O'Connor said the cities are asking the federal government to
pay their fair share.
   ``What we're all finding together is that one voice in
Washington is not enough,'' she said. ``We need to stand
together.''

<HEAD>Letter Mailed During North Pole Sub Voyage Arrives 32 Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHULA VISTA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A letter sent by a sailor on the
first submarine to sail under the ice of the North Pole arrived at
his brother's home last week, 32 years after the historic voyage.
   Denny Breese, now a 56-year-old treasure hunter living in North
Carolina, was a 25-year-old seaman when he wrote the letter aboard
the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus.
   It was addressed to his younger brother Nick, who lived then at
the family's home in Chula Vista, about 10 miles south of San
Diego.
   The letter said, in part:
   ``This will be short. ... I just found out the mail is leaving
the boat in about 15 minutes. I just want you to get this envelope
that was stamped from the North Pole.''
   Although the letter was sent with a sense of urgency, either
rain, sleet, snow, an iceberg or some other force delayed its
delivery. Neither Nick, now a 50-year-old salesman who lives in
Fort Worth, Texas, nor his brother has lived at the Chula Vista
home in more than 20 years.
   Kathy Atkinson, who lives at the Breese's old address, was
surprised when she looked through the mail Thursday and found an
envelope that was postmarked: ``USS Nautilus. North Pole. 11:15
p.m. Aug. 3, 1958.''
   ``I've heard about this kind of thing happening,'' she said.
``But 32 years later?''
   Atkinson and a roommate contacted Breese's father, who still
leaves in Chula Vista, and the letter eventually found its way to
its intended recipient.
   ``I'm glad (Nick) got the letter,'' Denny Breese said Sunday
from his houseboat in Beaufort, N.C. ``He's certainly going to be
surprised.''
   The letter was sent with a seven-cent stamp depicting President
Woodrow Wilson. It arrived open, but otherwise intact.
   ``It's impossible to tell where it's been,'' said Mike Cannone,
a Postal Service spokesman in San Diego. ``This happens
occasionally.''
   The 323-foot-long Nautilus was launched in January 1955 and had
a crew of more than 100. It made the first transpolar voyage
beneath the North Pole on Aug. 3, 1958.

<TEXT>
   The White House pledged today President Bush
will work closely with Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis but said
he might be forced to order military action on his own in the event
of ``unforeseen kinds of provocations.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, addressing
concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers, said Bush will work with
Congress ``every step of the way. We have no intention of leaving
Congress out.''
   Fitzwater added, ``He will follow the constitutional
requirements, and we would want to consult with the Congress every
step of the way. But there are always those unforeseen kinds of
provocations that might result in having to move first.''
   Congress needs to be involved in any decision to fight, several
congressional Democrats said Sunday, several days after Bush
announced plans to nearly double the 230,000 troops in the Persian
Gulf to provide an ``adequate offensive option.''
   ``The last thing we need is to have a war over there, a bloody
war, and have American boys being sent and brought back in body
bags and yet not have the American people behind them,'' said
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga. ``We've
gone that route one time. We don't need to do it again.''
   Without saying so directly, Fitzwater suggested the Democrats
were overreacting. ``Not a shot's been fired. What are these guys
talking about?'' he said.
   Fitzwater added, ``The Congress wants to be vigilant and on top
of this - urge caution all the way, and that's appropriate.''
   ``It's not for the president by himself to decide whether or not
to go to war,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. said today.
``He has to have the Congress with him, that is the law.''
   ``If George Bush wants his presidency to die in the Arabian
desert, he's going at it very steadily and as if it were a plan,''
Moynihan said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``It's as if that great force that was created to fight the Cold
War is at the president's own disposal for any diversion he may
wish, no matter what it costs. He will wreck our military, he will
wreck his administration and he'll spoil a chance to get a
collective security system working. It breaks the heart,'' Moynihan
said.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said Bush ``ought to have the
broadest possible achievable international consensus'' before
launching an offensive.
   ``The decision to go to war ought to be a shared responsibility,
it ought not to be made by one person, even if that person is the
president of the United States,'' Hamilton, a key House Foreign
Relations Committee member, said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press''
program.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, appearing on
ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' said Congress must vote
before America goes to war. And Senate Foreign Relations Chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said the United Nations ``should have some
input'' before U.S. troops go into combat.
   Nunn said Bush's new offensive posture was at sharp odds with
the original objective of defending Saudi Arabia.
   ``It is something the military were not given to begin with and
were not prepared for,'' Nunn said on the CBS-TV program ``Face the
Nation.'' ``And I think the president has a real obligation here -
perhaps he can do this, he should - to explain why liberating
Kuwait is in our vital interest.''
   Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said Congress should vote on a
declaration of war before any substantial military conflict with
Iraq. And Vietnam-era Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said
lawmakers should not be allowed to claim they were kept ignorant as
the nation became embroiled in war.
   Mitchell, reiterating recent statements, said ``Congress and
only Congress can commit the nation to war. The president has no
legal authority.''
   He and House Armed Service Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
said it was not time yet to call Congress into session for such a
debate. They said it would only be ``hypothetical'' because Bush
has not yet decided to launch combat operations in the gulf.
   Pell, also appearing on ``Meet the Press,'' said that unless
U.S. lives were at stake, America should not launch a combat drive
without congressional approval, ``if not a declaration of war, at
least a resolution of authorization.''
   Nunn renewed an earlier warning against American involvement in
a ground war in the region.
   ``I think getting bogged down in a ground war there is the last
thing we want and plays right into Saddam Hussein's hands and makes
our logistics difficulties, which are already present, much more
difficult,'' he said.

   Political analysts assume the American people
would rally behind President Bush if the United States went to war
against Iraq. But they also predict a prolonged conflict with high
casualties could hurt his chances for a second term.
   ``I think that's going to be the wild card in this next
presidential election,'' said John White, a former Democratic Party
chairman. ``If we have a war, if there are high casualties, it will
be a referendum on George Bush.''
   There was bipartisan agreement that if the president decides to
go to war, he must do a better job telling the American people why
that step is necessary.
   ``We learned from Vietnam that Americans have to be convinced
and sold on a rationale for our involvement,'' said Neil Newhouse,
a pollster with the Republican firm headed by Richard Wirthlin.
   Once involved in a conflict, he said, ``Don't overestimate the
patience of the American people and don't underestimate the
expectations.''
   Newhouse said most Americans expect a war with Iraq would be won
as quickly as the actions against Grenada and Panama, which ended
within days.
   White predicted that in the event of war, the Democrats would
have to nominate for president in 1992 ``someone who warned or
tried to prevent this thing from happening.''
   Democrats who fit that description are beginning to emerge,
among them Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   On Sunday, Nunn said that ``the last thing we need is to have a
war over there, a bloody war, and have American boys being sent and
brought back in body bags and yet not have the American people
behind them.''
   Nunn frequently is mentioned as a likely contender for the 1992
Democratic presidential nomination.
   Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., a decorated veteran of the Vietnam
War, also has been an early critic of the extent of the U.S.
buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   ``There's not a lot of mileage in backing off Saddam Hussein,''
said Peter Teeley, a consultant and long-time adviser to Bush.
``Clearly, nobody wants to see American boys in a shooting war, but
the fact of the matter is that Saddam's going to have to be dealt
with at some point in time, one way or the other.''
   After Bush announced last week that up to 200,000 more U.S.
troops were being dispatched to the region, speculation intensified
that the president was ready to go on the offensive to dislodge
Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.
   Accompanying that was a flurry of discussion of what impact war
would have on the next presidential election. Would the expected
surge of support for American servicemen in combat be transferred
to the president who ordered them there?
   ``We can say here's what we think will happen, or here's how the
American people will react,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
``Nobody can know. You don't know how you would react; I don't know
how I would react.''
   Conservative David Keene said the impact of a war on the 1992
elections would ``depend on how the war goes and how well the
president is able to articulate his reasons for taking that step. I
think the public will support a winning military effort if it isn't
too costly or too long if they undersand the reasons for it.
   ``The problem at this point is that we've gotten ourselves
bogged down over there for a long period of time with the president
issuing conflicting reasons and rationales for our being there.
Sometimes it's to deter aggression; sometimes it's energy;
sometimes it's democratic values.''
   ``Even a victory with high casualties will probably destroy his
presidency,'' said White, who had an insider's view of the
devastating impact of the Middle East on Jimmy Carter's presidency.
   ``He can take some casualties if he's showing that we're winning
and if there's a quick end to it,'' said White. ``But if it's a
stalemate, he can't take casualties and if it's a loss, he can't
take casualties.''
   ``The world is going to hold its breath hoping that Saddam
Hussein backs down,'' said Mike McCurry, a consutant and former
communications director of the Democratic National Committee. ``If
he doesn't, there is going to be a war and there are going to be
U.S. casualties. ... Opposition will rise naturally to military
action unless he's made a good case on why we're going to have make
some supreme sacrifices.''

   A diplomat at the British Embassy in Baghdad has
been expelled and Britain has retalitated by kicking out an Iraqi
diplomat in London, the Foreign Office said Monday.
   The Iraqi government said James Tansley, a second secretary at
the British Embassy used ``inappropriate language'' to
demonstrators at the diplomatic compound in Baghdad.
   Tansley, 28, a second secretary at the embassy, was given 10
days to leave Iraq, the Foreign Office said.
   The Foreign Office said it notified the Iraqi Embassy in London
that an official of comparable rank must leave witin 10 days, and
that second secretary Wajdi Marjan was being expelled.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Tansley, who has been in Baghdad
since early last year, ``said something that for one reason or
another the Iraqis felt was inappropriate''
   Tansley was among diplomats who visited Kuwait in the early days
of the invasion to try to assist British citizens. But the Foreign
Office stressed this seemed to be unconnected with the decision.
   Demonstrations have been taking place regularly outside the
British Embassy since shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
Aug. 2. British diplomats regularly receive petitions from
demonstrators.
   Shortly after the invasion, Britain announced the expulsion of
the Iraqi military attache staff in r. As director of operations at MCA

   Former Contra rebels and supporters on
Monday blocked roads to two more towns in a spreading protest of
President Violeta Chamorro's administration.
   Riot police using tear gas tried to destroy one roadblock but
were forced to withdraw when the people manning the barricades shot
at them, the Roman Catholic Church's radio station Radio Catolica
reported.
   The reported shooting took place near Boaco, 56 miles northeast
of Managua, Protesters also blocked the road leading to San Rafael
del Norte in northern Nicaragua.
   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo said despite the breakdown
of weekend negotiations between Mrs. Chamorro and mayors of 16
towns in southeastern Nicaragua who support the protest, the
government is still willing to negotiate.
   ``Whenever they decide they want to talk, we're here,'' Lacayo
said.
   The mayors had not yet responded to a proposal by Mrs. Chamorro
to hold a meeting Wednesday in the southeastern town of Juigalpa to
discuss their demands, Lacayo said.
   For the last 10 days, former Contra rebels and supporters have
placed barricades along the Rama road, the only overland connection
between the rich southeast agricultural region and the rest of the
nation.
   The negotiations broke down early Sunday after 10 hours, when
the mayors 
   Wyss predicted that fixed-rate mortgages, which stand just above
10 percent nationally, could dip to 9.5 percent in coming weeks.
   Many economists believe that a recessionary economy would also
help to push interest rates lower because of sluggish demand for
loans.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting company, said he
expected the recession to last through most of 1991.
   ``The unemployment rate will keep rising all year long with the
economic downturn lasting for four to five quarters,'' he said.

   Michael Heseltine, a flamboyant former defense
secretary, has two das left to decide whether to attempt the
once-unthinkable: ousting Margaret Thatcher as Conservative Party
leader and thus prime minister.
   The crisis has thrown the party's normally well-disciplined
legislators into turmoil. And suddenly all bets are off.
   With a mixture of behind-the-scenes threats, promises and
cajoling, Thatcher loyalists and Heseltine supporters are taking
soundings, adding up pledges and consulting crystal balls.
   Some Heseltine supporters claim they are within sight of the 159
votes needed to force a second ballot among the 372 Conservative
legislators in the House of Commons who elect the party leader.
   The leader of the party with a majority in the 650-member
Commons is automatically the prime minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher's supporters are seizing on everything from the
Persian Gulf crisis to the sheer dominance of the woman who has led
the party for 15 years and put her stamp on the nation through 11
years in power.
   The nomination deadline is noon Thursday and if there's a
challenger, a secret ballot will be held Nov. 20. Under the rules,
Mrs. Thatcher must get 50 percent of the votes cast and be 15
percent clear of the next placed to avoid a runoff. If not, a
second ballot with more newcomers would be held a week later.
   Whatever happens, it promises to be messy for the party.
   ``The problem is that in effect we have no agreed procedure for
getting rid of the prime minister,'' said Denis Kavanagh, professor
of politics at Nottingham University. ``It is like a presidential
system without presidential elections.''
   Heseltine, 57, has stalked Mrs. Thatcher skillfully since
quitting her Cabinet in January 1986 in a dispute over his plan to
resuce a helicopter-maker, Westland.
   A tall, handsome, self-made millionaire, he has toured the
country addressing party meetings, opening fetes, assiduously
avoiding direct criticism of Mrs. Thatcher - and biding his time
for a challenge.
   The routine has kept him the most instantly recognized
politician in Britain after Mrs. Thatcher - and also, polls
suggest, the favorite to succeed her.
   The party leader is elected annually in November. Since Mrs.
Thatcher ousted Edward Heath when her party was in opposition in
1975, she has been re-elected unopposed apart from a feeble
challenge last year.
   Rebellious murmurs remained as the Conservative continued to
trail the Labor Party for a dangerously long 16 months, mainly
because of economic troubles.
   The latest spark was the Nov. 1 resignation of Deputy Prime
Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe in protest of Mrs. Thatcher's combative
stance with the rest of the 12-nation European Community.
   Then the pro-European Heseltine struck with a well-publicized
letter obliquely criticizing Mrs. Thatcher. But he is wavering
about a challenge.
   ``We have a remarkable leader, she goes through 10 remarkable
years, she has a little bad patch and everyone wants her out of the
way,'' complained best-selling novelist Jeffrey Archer, a former
deputy chairman of the party. ``That, where I come from, is
disloyalty and hypocrisy.''
   Legislator Peter Temple-Morris, in the Heseltine camp, said the
Tories were doomed under Mrs. Thatcher and claimed there were
already 120 anti-Thatcher votes secured.
   ``Anything above 120 and obviously the prime minister's position
becomes extremely difficult, to put it mildly,'' he added.
   Scores of the more discreet legislators are promising support to
both sides or saying nothing, aware of the risk of being seen to
back the wrong leader.
   Many believe that a challenge will merely wound Mrs. Thatcher
and kill the Tories chances of re-election.
   However, there's a potential mine of anti-Thatcher votes. They
include about 60 worried legislators with wafer-thin majorities in
their constituencies and 35 more she has fired from her Cabinets or
other government jobs during her 11 years in power.

<TEXT>
   A California kindergarten teacher who created
a pen pal program to teach her pupils about the states was named
outstanding geography educator Monday.
   Arlene Johnston of Solana Vista Elementary School in Solana
Beach, Calif., was selected from 11 regional winners to receive
$10,000 in cash, an inscribed geophysical plaque and geography
teaching materials for her entire school.
   The Excellence in Geography Teaching Award program, established
this year by Rand McNally and the National Council for Geographic
Education, kicks off American Education Week being observed by
schools across the nation and National Geography Awareness Week.
   Johnston attributed the enthusiasm of the youngsters and their
parents for keeping up the momentum of her program, ``Our Friends
Across America.''
   Her 26 pupils became pen pals with friends or family members
representing all 50 states. They hung their letters on the
appropriate state on a giant map.
   To demonstrate the program's success, Johnston's kindergarteners
challenged local high school seniors that they could identify the
most states on a blank map. The youngsters won, 25 to 21.
   Officials said nearly 500 elementary and secondary teachers
competed for the award.
   The finalists each received $500, a crystal globe award and Rand
McNally teaching materials. They were:
   Virginia Tyler, Sarasota, Fla.; Mike Mower, American Fork, Utah;
E. Harven Tewes, Fort Worth, Texas; William Herman, Noblesville,
Ind.; Linda Poff, Princeton, W.Va.; June Ploen and Janet Kirch,
Glenview, Ill.; Judy Pearce and Charlene Hamaguchi, Honolulu;
Patricia Holmes Finlay, Jamestown, Ohio; June Switzer, Ontario,
Canada; and Richard Fisher, Aviano, Italy.

<HEAD>Bishops Urge Restraints On Any U.S. Military Action In Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops on Monday
urged restraint to minimize civilian casualties in any U.S.
military action in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Citing the church's longtime ``just war'' theory in regard to
the Middle East situation, bishops from across the country
declared:
   ``The military means used must be commensurate with the evil to
be overcome and must be directed at the aggressors, not innocent
people.''
   This rules out tactics that ``could clearly target civilian
lives'' and ``means this war would have to be a limited war,'' the
bishops said.
   They urged that under those circumstances the United States
``stay the course of persistent, peaceful and determined pressure
against Iraq,'' using military force as a last resort.
   The bishops' position was set forth in their affirming of a
letter about the crisis sent last week by Archbishop Roger Mahony
of Los Angeles to Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Mahony, head of the bishops' international policy committee,
later told a news conference that the bishops' stand countenanced
military force ``only after every other avenue has been explored
and tried.''
   ``The situation is fluid and changing daily,'' he said. ``It is
our hope that no use of force will be attempted.''
   As the bishops began their annual fall meeting, the subject
highlighted their discussion and indications were they may have
more to say about it.
   Although affirming the Mahony assessment by a 249 to 15 ballot,
they also decided to modify their agenda to consider the issue
further.
   But this was to be behind doors as moved by Cardinal Bernard Law
of Boston and upheld by a 126 to 118 vote.
   In lengthy debate, several bishops argued for open discussion of
the matter.
   ``It's important that we do more,'' said auxiliary Bishop Thomas
Gumbleton of Detroit, adding that it was critical to Americans who
``need moral guidance.'' about it.
   The bishops' affirmed stand firmly condemns Iraq's aggression,
the taking of civilian hostages and the ``brutal treatment'' of
civilians in Kuwait.
   In church tradition, the ``use of force is not ruled out
absolutely,'' but ``there is a clear presumption against war,'' the
bishops said.
   On other matters at the start of a four-day meeting, the bishops
gave preliminary consideration to policy statements on the
priesthood, inclusive language in the liturgy and sex education in
Catholic schools.
   Indications were that the latter would evoke considerable
controversy. But action on another touchy subject - a proposed
declaration on the role of women - was dropped from the agenda.
   Outside the hotel where the bishops were meeting, a throng of
women demonstrated for the right to be admitted to the priesthood.
   ``Discipleship of Equals'' their black-and-gold banners
proclaimed. ``Women Priests,'' ``New Women-New Church'' and ``Women
Imaging Christ.''
   Such ``imaging'' is what they can't do, says the Vatican in
ruling they can't be priests.

   From minister's son to congressman to prison
inmate, Robert Garcia has followed the advice in one of his
favorite hymns: ``In good times praise his name and in the bad
times do the same.''
   And that's the message he wants to share as he embarks on a new
career in prison ministry, Garcia said.
   ``Nothing guarantees a smooth, easy life,'' the 57-year-old
Garcia said in a recent interview. ``By knowing God, we have the
ability to handle it and that's all we can ask for in life.''
   Five months after an appeals court reversed his conviction in
the Wedtech Corp. scandal, Garcia has joined Prison Fellowship
Ministries, the organization founded by Chuck Colson of Watergate
notoriety.
   ``In terms of their spiritual lives, it's important that inmates
understand our relationships with God are the most important thing
we have,'' he said.
   Garcia says his faith has carried him through since January 197
when several Wedtech officers pleaded guilty to paying bribes to
obtain military contracts and gave prosecutors names of those they
said were involved.
   The Democratic congressman, who represented the South Bronx
neighborhood where Wedtech was located, was among several local
politicians charged in the corruption scheme. Garcia and his wife,
Jane, were accused of demanding payoffs from Wedtech in return for
his influence in Washington.
   A jury convicted them last year of extortion and both were
sentenced to three years in prison with the recommendation they be
released on parole after serving six months. Garcia resigned his
congressional seat on Jan. 19 after his conviction.
   He spent 104 days at the minimum-security federal prison at
Eglin Air Force Base in Florida before the conviction was
overturned in June. The appeals court, which found the jury had not
been properly instructed on the law, left open the possibility of a
new trial for Garcia and his wife, who remained free while their
appeal was being heard.
   Federal prosecutors decided to continue the case and the Garcias
will be retried beginning next month unless a judge accepts their
argument that they can't be tried twice for the same offense.
   Garcia has a wide range of experience with prison life.
   As a young state senator from the Bronx, he was called on to
serve as a negotiator during the bloody uprising at the Attica
state prison in 1971.
   He also served as chairman of the state Senate's Crime and
Correction Committee, which required his visiting many of the
state's facilities.
   ``I've come full circle in this thing,'' Garcia said.
   As a paid consultant with Prison Fellowship, Garcia will help
develop a program to match released inmates with churches in their
communities and lobby his former colleagues on Capitol Hill on
prison reform issues.
   Garcia said he first got the idea of working for Colson's
organization when he attended a Bible study group run by Prison
Fellowship.
   But prison ministry is something he would best like to do from
the outside.
   ``If there was any one time in my life I wanted to yell and
scream about how happy I was, that was it,'' Garcia said.

<HEAD>Security Increased At U.S. Universities Following Threats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities are tightening security at American
university branches in Italy because a purported terrorist group
has threatened to attack the schools if U.S. troops move against
Iraq, officials said Monday.
   ``We have been in touch with the schools and with the Italian
police and are working with them to assure they have the protection
needed,'' said a U.S. Embassy spokesman.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said six
American university branches in Florence and Bologna had recently
received threatening letters from a previously unknown group
calling itself the Secret Popular Revolutionary Movement.
   ``If the imperialist Americans attack Iraqi territory, we will
hit hard American interests'' in the cities, said the letters,
according to Italian news reports.
   The embassy spokesman said he could not release the names of the
universities involved.
   Italian newspapers have identified four of them as Georgetown,
Stanford and Syracuse in Florence and Johns Hopkins in Bologna.
   A Stanford official said its branch in Florence was not among
those affected. Eileen Walsh, acting director of Stanford News
Service, spoke from Palo Alto, Calif.
   Michael Good, director of the Syracuse program in Florence, said
that Syracuse was taking, ``every precaution we would if we were
convinced (of the threat), even though we're not convinced.''
   A police spokesman in Florence said police were investigating
the threats and that surveillance of universities' buildings had
been increased. He declined to specify which facilities.
   The embassy spokesman said it was impossible to judge the
credibility of the threats. ``We take all threats seriously but no
one has ever heard of this group before,' he said.
   The spokesman would not describe how security had been
increased.
   ``Each of them is taking the measures they feel is
appropriate,'' he said. ``They are working with the police so that
whatever can be done is done.''

   When Sgt. George Yakstis came
home from Vietnam nearly 20 years ago, people spit and called him a
``baby killer.'' He said he quickly realized that not all his
enemies were in Southeast Asia.
   Two decades later, Yakstis and other Vietnam veterans in
Operation Desert Shield said the return to active service has been
a healing process of sorts.
   On Monday, they marked Veteran's Day by recalling the animosity
of a former time and savoring a surge of domestic support for their
current mission.
   ``I can remembering flying into San Francisco at the end of my
tour and having to take off my uniform and put on my civilian
clothes because people were asking questions like, `How many babies
did you kill?' Yakstis said.
   The soldier, from Rockaway, N.J. and deployed with the 253rd
Transportation Company of the New Jersey National Guard, said some
people even spit on him.
   ``I think it'll be different when we come back next time,'' he
said. ``I think our parade will be even bigger than when we left.''
   About 15 percent of the National Guardsmen here are Vietnam
veterans, although the total number of vets among the 230,000 U.S.
troops deployed in Saudi Arabia since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait is not known.
   Sgt. 1st Class Jim Calvini, of Norwell, Mass., said he will
never forget the ridicule and hatred he faced upon returning from
Vietnam in 1969.
   ``We were all baby killers,'' he said. ``There was no parade. We
were sent to do a dirty job and people thought that was that. It's
something I'll never forget.''
   But he said the support in Massachusetts for him and the other
members of the 1058 Transport Company of the National Guard has
helped him to forgive.
   ``Those people were amazing,'' he said. ``It was unbelievable
the sendoff we got. Flags were all over town and yellow ribbons and
everything.''
   Yakstis and many other veterans said they were moved by the
parades that many towns organized to bid farewell to troops called
to active duty. For veterans, it was like a late coming-home party.
   ``When I drove away, I was in the truck by myself and I started
to cry,'' said Sgt. Joseph Marchina, also of the 253rd. ``I'm not
afraid to admit I left some tears behind. That parade felt like it
was what should have happened 20 years ago.''
   Marchina, of North Cape May, N.J., said he is confident that
support for their current mission will remain firm at home.
   The Vietam veterans have found themselves boosting the morale
of younger soldiers.
   Although living conditions in the airplane
hangars-turned-dormitories are cramped and unsanitary, the veterans
have seen worse. The filthy latrines, the narrow cots and the
cool-water showers - they've seen them before.
   ``I was complaining about the showers and our Vietnam guys told
me they had to get clean in the creek when they were there,'' said
Spc. Tracey King, 23, of Lewisburg, Tenn. ``They kind of help us
appreciate what we do have.''
   King, of the 251st Transportation Company of the National Guard,
said the veterans get an extra bit of respect in the camps,
regardless of rank.
   ``Everyone knows what they went through and we ain't been
through nothing like they have,'' King said. ``We kind of look up
to them.''

   Lisa Kirk, the brassy Broadway performer who
sang ``The Gentleman Is a Dope'' in ``Allegro'' and ``Why Can't You
Behave?'' in ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' has died of lung cancer at age 64.
   Kirk died Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said
her husband, Robert Wells.
   The singer, born in Brownsville, Pa., made her Broadway debut in
1945 in ``Good Night, Ladies,'' but became a star two years later
when she stopped Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``Allegro'' with her
sassy rendition of ``The Gentleman Is a Dope.''
   In 1948, Kirk originated the role of Bianca in Cole Porter's
``Kiss Me, Kate,'' co-starring with Alfred Drake, Patricia Morison
and Harold Lang in the long-running musical.
   She toured in many shows including ``Show Boat,'' ``Panama
Hattie,'' ``Say, Darling,'' ``Riverwind'' and ``Applause.''
   In 1964, she replaced Janis Paige in the Meredith Willson
musical ``Here's Love'' on Broadway and appeared in the Los Angeles
company. Ten years later, she appeared in Jerry Herman's ``Mack and
Mabel'' which starred Robert Preston and Bernadette Peters.
   She is survived by her husband.

<HEAD>Congressional Worry Grows Over Bush's Gulf Moves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress expressed increasing worry
Monday over President Bush's latest moves in the Persian Gulf,
warning that he is stepping out ahead of his carefully created
international consensus and that Americans as well as allies may
balk at going to war.
   ``If George Bush wants his presidency to die in the Arabian
desert, he's going to get his wish,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an
interview.
   Bush's spokesman quickly retorted, ``Not a shot's been fired.
What are these guys talking about?''
   The spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Bush has no intention of
leaving Congress out of his decisionmaking.
   ``They know what we're doing,'' Fitzwater said. ``They've been
kept informed every step of the way. It's appropriate that they be
cautious, that they express these concerns. There's nothing wrong
with that.''
   Following Bush's announcement last week that the United States
will begin a huge new deployment to gain an offensive capability in
the region, the tone on Capitol Hill has shifted from cautious
support to apprehension.
   Speaking in Albany, Ga., on Monday, Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler
said Congress should come back into session after Thanksgiving to
debate the issue and to better define America's goals: ``What will
constitute victory, how long it might take and, more importantly,
to pursue every economic and diplomatic strategy, so that hopefully
we can eliminate the military option.''
   Moynihan's comment was among the harshest assessments yet of the
president's handling of the crisis, which has enjoyed broad if
nervous support from Congress since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Others, including Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., the senior
GOP member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have voiced concern
over the president's failure to consult broadly with Congress on
the latest deployment.
   But Fitzwater said public support for Bush ``has been very
strong'' and added: ``We don't want to go to war. President Bush
will say the same things these congressmen are saying - be
cautious, follow the policy, support the U.N. resolutions, consult
with Congress.''
   Bush has said he still hopes economic sanctions backed by United
Nations resolutions and supported by most foreign nations will
persuade Iraq to leave Kuwait without fighting.
   One senior congressional aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said lawmakers who have spent time among the voters in
recent weeks are reflecting public unease with the gulf situation.
The aide predicted that Bush would come under heavier fire from the
Democratic-controlled Congress in the coming weeks.
   Senior administration officials, including Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell, are to
brief lawmakers on Tuesday for the first time since Congress
adjourned Oct. 28. And members of the bipartisan leadership were
scheduled to meet with Bush at the White House on Wednesday.
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said
he was not consulted about the latest troop buildup and received a
call only Friday, the day after Bush announced it publicly.
   ``I haven't been told reasons why we have to rush this thing,''
Nunn said in a weekend television interview. ``Why not let the
embargo work? ... War should be the last option.''
   Nunn said Bush has failed to explain, either to Congress or the
American people, why the liberation of Kuwait is ``an interest so
important we're willing to spend thousands of American lives, if
necessary.''
   Moynihan said he was ``stunned'' by last week's developments,
including the announcement that U.S. troops would not be rotated
home from their gulf positions and the administration's conclusion
that the United States is free under the United Nations charter to
take whatever military action it wants.
   ``That's the pattern of a country going to war,'' Moynihan said.
``He's decided, he's gone unilateral.''
   Moynihan hypothetically posed two newspaper headlines: ``U.S.
Invades Third World Country in Dispute Over Access to Raw
Materials,'' and ``World Unites in Support of Tiny Nation Overrun
by Brutal Aggressor.''
   The second is the story the United States wants, he said, but
Bush by going it alone is risking the first headline.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
believed Bush's actions are less ominous, that the White House is
simply seeking to use a heightened threat of war to force Iraq to
capitulate without shots being fired.
   But he also cautioned that the Constitution gives Congress alone
the power to commit U.S. troops to war. He noted that Congress
could be called back into session to debate that question if an act
of war occurs or if the president decides war is necessary.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the New York-based Center for
Constitutional Rights said some members of Congress are likely to
seek legal action in the courts to force Bush to comply with the
War Powers Act.
   ``It's apparent that a lot of Congress people have questions
about the procedural action,'' said David Lerner, a spokesman for
the group. ``A lot of them are worried that while they are out, war
will break out.''
   Center attorneys have previously represented individual
lawmakers on similar attempts to force the White House to consult
Congress before deploying more troops.
   At least one lawmaker, Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., has
contacted the center to discuss the possibility of bringing a new
court case, Lerner said.
   The War Powers Act requires presidential consultation with
Congress and puts limits on troop deployments without direct
congressional authorization if troops are fighting or under
imminent threat of hostilities.
   Such suits in the past have been dismissed on the ground that
the courts cannot enter political debates over foreign policy. But
Lerner said center attorneys feel it is important to raise the
issue in as many forums as possible.

<HEAD>Israel Offers Compromise to U.N. on Temple Mount Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to avoid further U.N. Security
Council criticism, Israeli officials on Monday offered to receive a
U.N. envoy to discuss the treatment of Palestinians under Israeli
occupation.
   The offer was billed as a compromise, and the government made it
clear that its offer did not change Israel's rejection of a
Security Council resolution condemning the Oct. 8 Temple Mount
killings and demanding an investigation.
   Sari Nusseibeh, a pro-PLO Palestinian leader in Jerusalem,
rejected the Israeli proposal as a ``fruitless enterprise.''
   ``What the Palestinians need is tangible, effective
international involvement,'' Nusseibeh said. The Palestine
Liberation Organization has called for a U.N. force to protect the
1.7 million Arabs in the occupied lands.
   An Israeli government official said the compromise proposal was
worked out in negotiations with the United States, which reportedly
refused an earlier Israeli plea to veto any further U.N. criticism.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Israel
had reached ``an understanding'' with Washington, but he did not
make clear if his government had a guarantee that the United States
would veto further criticism.
   ``I cannot guarantee this or another move in the name of the
United States,'' Foreign Minister David Levy said. ``But after
intensive contacts with the most senior levels in the United States
... one can report a good progress.''
   ``We have returned to the basic understanding that is necessary
in the relations between the two countries. I am pleased,'' he
said.
   Israel radio said the United States had agree to work to remove
the Temple Mount killings from the U.N. agenda if Israel received a
U.N. envoy.
   American officials have said they want world attention shifted
from Israel and back to the Persian Gulf crisis, and they have
pressured Israel to accept an investigation into the Temple Mount
killings. Israeli police shot to death 20 Palestinians in rioting
at the holy site.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said in New York that
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``is now considering
sending an emissary.''
   However, she added: ``We do not accept conditions'' on the terms
of the visit.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering,
said of the Israeli proposal: ``I'm not sure that that is
necessarily going to be possible, but we want to take a careful
look at this, and we'll be in touch with people about it.''
   Levy outlined the proposal Monday at a closed-door session of
Parliament's defense and foreign affairs committee.
   He reportedly ordered no official statements be made on the
compromise proposal.
   But the government official who explained the agreement said
Israel's idea was to urge Perez de Cuellar to dispatch his aide,
Jean Claude Aime, ``in continuation of his mission of June 1990.''
   Aime was last in Israel to look into the killings of seven
Palestinians by an Israeli in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Lezion
on May 20 and subsequent riots in the occupied territories in which
15 Palestinians died in army gunfire. His report was never made
public here.
   The Israeli official said the new mission would ``be detached
and have no connection'' with Security Council calls for an
investigation of the Temple Mount but would be aimed at reducing
tensions with the United Nations.
   Israel has argued that accepting a Security Council
investigation of the Temple Mount would threaten the nation's claim
to East Jerusalem. The Jewish state captured the Arab eastern
sector of the city from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and
later annexed it. The annexation is not recognized by most nations.
   After Israel's rejection of two Security Council votes and
refusal to cooperate with a U.N. probe, Perez de Cuellar declared
that Israel had failed to protect Palestinians.
   He suggested a meeting by the 164 nations that signed the 1949
Geneva Conventions, which outline rules on treatment of civilians
in war, to study ways to safeguard Palestinians in captured
territory.

   AIDS activists challenged researchers Monday
to find more effective treatments within the next 18 months for the
infections that most often kill people with AIDS.
   Members of ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, released
a detailed research plan at a news conference and then at a meeting
of AIDS researchers, saying potential therapies still have not been
studied.
   ``This is doable,'' said Garance Franke-Ruta of ACT UP. ``This
is a realistic plan. ... It's about removing the obstacles to
getting science done quickly and saving lives.''
   Coalition members have complained that federal research efforts
have focused too narrowly on deactivating the AIDS virus and not
enough on preventing and treating the infections that prey on the
weakened immune systems of those infected with the virus.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute on Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, called the plan reasonable.
   ``Most of what they're talking about is already in motion,'' he
said. ``Whether these (infections) will be conquered in 18 months,
I can't predict. ... I hope we can.''
   The plan targets the five opportunistic infections that kill 90
percent of people with AIDS: pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma gondii, mycobacterium avium
intracellulare and various fungal infections.
   Though drugs have been developed to combat some of those
infections, not all patients can tolerate the treatments. And, in
some cases, the drugs are too toxic to be used with AZT, the only
FDA-approved drug that fights the AIDS virus directly.
   The coalition also said useful therapies have been delayed in
the red tape of the bureaucracy.
   ``Essentially, nobody's home when it comes to AIDS,''
Franke-Ruta said.

<HEAD>`Heart Attack Maker' Linked to Increased Heart Disease in Blacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A protein that a researcher calls the ``heart
attack maker'' is elevated in black Americans and could explain
their increased rate of heart attacks, says a study released
Monday.
   ``It is helpful in explaining why some individuals have heart
attacks at early ages,'' said Dr. Thomas Pearson of the Mary
Imogene Bassett Research Institute in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   A study of white and black doctors in their 50s revealed that
levels of the protein were more than twice as high in the blacks,
Pearson said at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart
Association.
   The protein, called lipoprotein (a), or Lp(a), is related to and
probably works like LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, Pearson
said.
   ``I call it the heart attack maker,'' he said, because it packs
a double punch. Like LDL, it encourages the clogging of arteries.
But, unlike LDL, it also interferes with an enzyme that helps to
dissolve the resulting clots.
   Last year, Pearson's study of black and white doctors led him to
the finding that the risk of heart disease in the black doctors was
2.4 times that of the risk in the white doctors.
   The discovery of a corresponding difference in Lp(a) levels
``may be a new area to help explain that,'' he said.
   ``We think that Lp(a) is a major, major risk factor - right up
there with hypertension - for coronary heart disease in blacks,''
Pearson said.
   The study was done on 106 white doctors who graduated from the
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore and 92
black graduates of Meharry Medical College in Nashville.
   Pearson and his colleagues looked not only at Lp(a) levels in
the doctors but also at their levels of so-called good cholesterol,
or HDL, which protects against heart disease.
   The researchers found in the whites that the higher their Lp(a)
level, the lower their HDL. In the blacks, the results were the
opposite: the higher the Lp(a) levels, the higher the levels of
protective HDL.
   So why did the black have the increased heart disease risk? ``It
is certainly hard to understand,'' Pearson said, but he speculated
that genetic or other differences between blacks and whites could
affect Lp(a) levels.
   Pearson said the close link between Lp(a) levels and heart
disease risk in blacks means that Lp(a) levels could be used to
identify blacks who are at risk of heart disease, even though their
other measures of heart disease risk might be normal.
   Before that can be done, however, researchers must further
clarify the role of Lp(a) in heart disease and must devise better
means of measuring Lp(a) levels, Pearson said.
   So far, he said, ``this is still very much on the research
front.''

   The USS Williamsburg, President Truman's
official yacht, is for sale to the highest bidder willing to have
the vessel made seaworthy, a spokeswoman for the city government
said Monday.
   Tara Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the District of Columbia's
Public Works Department, said the Williamsburg has been anchored
near a sewage plant for a year as the city searched for a buyer.
   She declined comment on reports that the vessel, which featured
black steel with teak trim and polished brass during its heyday,
had fallen into disrepair and that its 243-foot-hulk had trees
growing through it.
   The Kansas City Star reported Sunday that the ship had been
vandalized and that its deck was covered with broken glass and
empty beer bottles.
   If no one purchases the vessel, which also served a brief stint
as a floating restaurant in New Jersey and before that as a
floating laboratory by The National Science Foundation in Norfolk,
Va., it faces demolition in July 1992, the newspaper said.
   Richard Lynn, the owner of River City U.S.A. in Kansas City,
Kan., once looked into buying the Williamsburg, according to K.C.
Stanley, a spokeswoman for the company.
   She said Lynn had hoped the 2,000-ton ship was salvageable and
could be used as a floating museum of American history.
   ``We were mainly interested in the boat because of its
historical significance,'' said Ms. Stanley, who is also a licensed
riverboat pilot.
   ``But when we learned that the vessel was in such disrepair, we
decided that the investment wasn't worth what it would have cost to
salvage it.''
   The restoration of the 36-foot-wide vessel with a 14-foot-draft
would cost an estimated $7 million - more if the ship is to ever
sail again, according to naval experts.
   The Williamsburg could be eligible for federal funds if it were
ever named a national landmark.

   Church carnival roulette wheels that
used rats and gerbils as game pieces were shut down after
animal-protection activists complained the attraction was cruel.
   ``Pulling a rat out of a cup and throwing him on a board so he
can run into a hole is not a humane act,'' said Mary Ann Klemm of
the St. Petersburg Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
   Police forced operators of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church to
shut down two games Sunday or face charges of animal cruelty.
   The games involve rodents running into one of the colored holes
along the edges of a circular wooden board. The person who bet on
the colored hole the rodent picks wins.
   Fred Thumberg, owner of the amusement company the church hired
to put on the carnival, said rodent games have been in carnivals

   ``It's a difference of opinion. That's all it really amounts
to,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic,
said Monday that Russia would not pull out of the Soviet Union and
that he would try to settle his jurisdictional disputes with
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Yeltsin's remarks came a day after he met behind closed doors
for four hours with Gorbachev, his longtime political rival.
Previous agreements between the leaders have broken down, and
economists said their future cooperation is crucial to solving the
country's economic crisis.
   Speaking to the Russian Parliament's constitutional commission,
Yeltsin emphatically denied that Russia, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics, ``wants to break up the union.''
   ``I'm for a strong union and union treaty,'' the independent
Interfax News Agency quoted him as saying.
   Gorbachev has been pushing the republics to negotiate a new
union treaty to transform the country into a confederation of
sovereign republics. Such a treaty could slow or perhaps even halt
the rapid fragmentation that began with Lithuania's declaration of
independence last March.
   While Yeltsin reiterated his desire for a new treaty, he
insisted Russia and the central government must first decide who
controls the republic's banking system, natural resources, money
supply and foreign currency earnings.
   ``They pressed us, yesterday and earlier, first to sign a union
treaty and then resolve remaining issues, in the meantime
transferring everything to the authority of the center,'' he said.
   ``But we couldn't and will not go for that.''
   Yeltsin said he and Gorbachev agreed to set up two parallel
committees to study how to share control over the economy. Russia
has been trying to wrest control over banks, natural resources and
other key economic factors so that it can take faster steps toward
a market system.
   The Russian Parliament has adopted a 500-day blueprint for
switching from central planning to a market-based economy. Although
it formally voted to begin putting the plan into effect Nov. 1, it
has been unable to take concrete steps because it lacks clear
control of prices, currency, interest rates, land and real estate.
   Gorbachev and the national legislature have approved a slower
reform plan that skirts some fundamental issues, such as whether to
break up collective farms. The president has called for a
referendum to decide whether to allow private ownership of land.
   Two of Gorbachev's top economic advisers, Stanislav Shatalin and
Nikolai Petrakov, joined 11 other economists in an open letter last
week criticizing Gorbachev's tentative reform plan. They predicted
it would increase the budget deficit, cause rapid inflation and
lead to further disintegration of the consumer market, already
marked by shortages of everyday items ranging from gasoline to eggs
and glass bottles.
   Yet another leading Soviet economist, Oleg Bogomolov, criticized
Gorbachev's plan this week as a vague statement of goals, rather
than a map for actual changes.
   In an interview published in the weekly magazine Ogonyok,
Bogomolov said the country's hopes for emerging from its economic
crisis rest on ``cooperation between the center and Russia, or, to
be more specific, between two leaders - Gorbachev and Yeltsin.''
   Ivan Silaev, prime minister of the Russian republic, told a news
conference Monday that recent meetings between the republic's
leaders and central government officials have resulted in partial
agreements on some jurisdictional issues, including control over
foreign currency earnings.
   A commentator for the official Tass news agency, Andrei Orlov,
wrote Monday that Gorbachev and Yeltsin ``seem to be `doomed' to
cooperation, irrespective of their likes and dislikes and their
political rivalry.''
   Orlov said an agreement in August by the two men to coordinate
their reforms had fallen apart, leaving leadership in disarray as
the economy worsened and the country ``approached the brink of an
abyss.''
   ``Yeltsin found out that radical reforms were impracticable in
Russia without Gorbachev's support, as was Gorbachev's radical
transformation of Soviet society without Russia,'' the Tass
commentator wrote.

   Joseph Cicippio Jr., whose father was
kidnapped in Lebanon more than four years ago, died over the
weekend of a heart attack, the third member of the hostage's family
to die during his captivity.
   Cicippio, 35, was taken by ambulance from his home to North Penn
Hospital before dawn Sunday, where efforts to revive him failed,
said Gerard Gribbon, vice president for administration at the
hospital.
   The death came as a shock to a family that has had to deal with
the strain of years of imprisonment of Joseph Cicippio Sr., 60, and
threats by his kidnappers.
   ``This is a very, very difficult time for all of us,'' said
Thomas Cicippio, brother to Joseph Cicippio Sr. ``This is shocking
news. It's hard to say anything in reference to it.''
   In August 1989, the kidnappers sentenced Cicippio to death in
retaliation for Israel's abduction of a Lebanese Shiite cleric.
They released videotapes of Cicippio pleading for his life and
finally announced a reprieve.
   Since then, Thomas Cicippio said, the family has heard nothing.
``We have no idea what's going on at the present time.''
   He said he understands that the Lebanese extremists holding
American hostages do receive news about their captives. ``We have
no way of knowing if they will let Joseph know,'' he said.
   Joseph Cicippio Jr. worked as director of installation for SMS
Co., a computer time-sharing service for medical offices in King of
Prussia in suburban Philadelphia.
   Besides his father, he is survived by his mother, five brothers,
a sister, his wife, and a son and a daughter. His son, Michael, 3,
was born while his grandfather was a hostage.
   Joseph Cicippio Sr., a former resident of Norristown, was taken
hostage in Beirut on Sept. 12, 1986. His sister, Rose Abell, 73,
died of cancer months after his kidnapping. Her husband, Bill, 80,
died last year of a heart attack.
   Cicippio was on his way to work as acting comptroller at the
American University of Beirut when the pro-Iranian Revolutionary
Justice Organization abducted him.
   Thomas Cicippio displays signs on his front lawn listing the
number of days Americans have been held hostage in Lebanon. Monday
was Day No. 1,523 in captivity for his brother.
   The only Americans held in Lebanon longer are Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, and Thomas
Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American University
of Beirut. Anderson's father and elder brother have died since he
was taken hostage March 16, 1985. Sutherland was kidnapped June 9,
1985.

<DATELINE>SKOPJE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voting officials said Monday that the
party of Yugoslavia's reformist premier, Ante Markovic, held a
slight edge over the governing Communists in unofficial returns
from free elections in Macedonia.
   Markovic's Alliance of Reformist Forces advocates market
economics and keeping this fragile Balkan federation of six
republics united.
   Western observer teams expressed general satisfaction with
Sunday's voting. But the state Tanjug news agency reported later
that irregularities led election officials to annul results in some
districts and that 25,000 people gathered near Skopje to protest
alleged attempts to keep them from voting.
   ``Initial counting has indicated that Markovic is just ahead of
the Communists,'' said an official of the state electoral
commission, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He could not provide specific figures.
   ``I have indications that the party is doing excellently,''
Stojan Andov, the chief of the Alliance in Macedonia, said in an
interview. An aide said Andov himself won a seat from the capital,
Skopje, with 73 percent of the vote.
   The polling in the southern republic, Yugoslavia's poorest, was
viewed as a crucial test for Markovic, whose party was competing in
an election for the first time.
   A good showing will boost its chances in elections in the states
of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro and Serbia in the next weeks.
   Tanjug said results were annulled in five districts because of
reported irregularities. More invalidations probably will follow.
New voting was expected in the districts affected.
   The agency quoted Electoral Commission President Velko Paunovski
as saying irregularities included unlisted voters; keeping citizens
from casting ballots; a shortage of ballots, and the like.
   In Tetovo, about 30 miles southwest of Skopje, 25,000
Macedonians rallied, complaining of voting interference by ethnic
Albanians. Tanjug did not report any violence.
   Markovic's personal popularity grew steadily after he became
federal premier in March 1989. But his reforms and efforts to
preserve the federation have been undermined by political
squabbling and increasing ethnic tensions.
   Official results were not expected until Thursday. Runoff
elections will be held Nov. 25 in districts where no one received
50 percent of the vote.
   Turnout was estimated at 75 percent of the 1.37 million eligible
voters among Macedonia's 2.2 million population.
   Skopje TV reported that Petar Gosev, leader of the former
Communist Party, recently renamed the Party of Democratic Change,
won a majority in his Skopje district.
   Gosev supports Markovic's policies and says he would be prepared
to form a coalition with Markovic's party in runoff elections.
   A coalition of four nationalist, right-wing parties charged
there was widespread electoral fraud Sunday and demanded the
election be declared invalid.
   Public opinion polls had indicated the parties probably would
fare poorly in the balloting.
   Another contender was the mainly ethnic Albanian Party of
Democratic Prosperity. People of Albanian origin account for more
than 20 percent of Macedonia's population.
   Western observers said the elections were free and fair.
   ``We were very positively, very favorably impressed by the
fairness of the elections and by the confident manner in which they
were carried out,'' declared David Evans, a senior adviser to a
U.S. congressional commission overseeing human rights and security
in Europe.
   Markovic's reforms, including privatization and the lifting of
import and foreign investment restrictions, have angered the
hard-line leadership of Communist-led Serbia, the largest Yugoslav
state.
   Serbia's state-run press has accused him of being a Western
agent and of wanting to turn Yugoslavia into a ``banana republic.''
   The non-communist governments in Croatia and Slovenia, which
advocate transforming Yugoslavia into a loose association of
near-independent states, are wary of Markovic's insistence on
keeping Yugoslavia a federation.

   Government troops repulsed an attack by
rebel forces in the second clash along Chad's border with Sudan in
three days, the Defense Ministry announced Monday.
   It did not say whether there were casualties, how many were
involved in the fighting or whether the shooting took place on the
Sudanese or Chadian side of the border.
   Chad claims the rebels are supported by Libya and Sudan. Both
countries deny any role in the fighting and maintian that only
Chadian dissidents are involved.
   The ministry reported the fighting broke out near the outpost of
Tine in eastern Chad but was rebuffed by loyalist troops.
   The attack appeared to be near the site of Saturday's fighting
between government forces and 2,000 rebels of the Islamic Legion
based in the Darfur province of Sudan.
   The government said the Legion, reportedly equipped with armored
vehicles, was repelled after 24 hours of fighting.
   Libya and Chad fought a war in the early 1980s and have since
engaged in sporadic negotiations over their disputed border. The
most recent round of talks were last month.

   A special investigator on Monday summoned
former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, leader of the socialist
opposition, to testify before him on Nov. 22, state-owned
television said.
   Papandreou faces three criminal charges of involvement in the
$210 million embezzlement of the privately owned Bank of Crete in
1988.
   The charges carry a minimum five-year prison term.
   It was not immediately known whether Papandreou would accept the
summons. He says the charges are a political conspiracy.
   Two former members of his administration have been jailed
pending trial on like charges after testifying before Appeals Court
investigator Spyros Spyrou.
   Papandreou governed from 1981 to 1989. His administration was
rocked in 1988 by the discovery that George Koskotas, chairman and
owner of the Bank of Crete, had embezzled more than $200 million
from the bank.
   Koskotas fled to the United States and is fighting extradition.
He accused Papandreou and other government members of instigating
the embezzlement, and accepting bribes from the embezzled money.
   Papandreou and four members of his Cabinet were indicted by a
conservative-Communist coalition that succeeded the socialists
after June 1989 elections. No trial date has been set.
   Also on Monday, inmates at maximum-security Korydallos Prison in
Piraeus ended a 28-day rebellion, accepting government promises
hours after some of them escaped in the confusion.
   Police said prisoners made ropes of bedsheets and climbed over
the prison wall early in the morning. Four were immediately
arrested but the revolt made it impossible to tell how many
escaped, an officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   About 20 prisoners left the prison roof late in the afternoon
and returned to their cells after improved conditions were
promised.
   Initially, 700 of the 860 inmates were involved in the revolt.
The number gradually dwindled.
   No serious injuries were reported.

<TEXT>
   A son of a 69-year-old woman facing a
possible death sentence for plotting with her husband to kill five
men testified Monday his father dominated his mother and treated
her ``worse than trash.''
   A defense attorney asked a jury to spare Faye Copeland's life
because of the abuse. A prosecutor said she deserved to die for the
killings, which were part of a cattle swindle.
   The same jury that convicted Mrs. Copeland of five counts of
first-degree murder Saturday was expected to decide Tuesday between
the death penalty and life in prison. The jury heard testimony from
17 witnesses Monday.
   Mrs. Copeland could become the oldest person to get the death
penalty since it was reinstated in Missouri in 1977. She was
accused of plotting the murders of the five transients with her
husband to conceal a cattle-theft scheme.
   Also Tuesday, a psychologist is expected to testify about
battered-wife syndrome. That testimony was not allowed during the
trial.
   Mrs. Copeland's 75-year-old husband, Ray Copeland, faces trial
on similar charges on Jan. 24 but first must be found mentally
competent by the court. His attorneys claim he is senile.
   Prosecutors claim Copeland was the trigger man.
   A daughter-in-law, Bonnie Copeland, who lived nearby, testified
that Copeland never physically struck his wife.
   But another daughter said he dominated Mrs. Copeland and her six
children. ``He told us exactly what to do and when to do it,'' said
Betty Lou Gibson of Richfield, Ky. ``There was no discussion. That
was it.''
   Mrs. Copeland idolized her husband, Mrs. Gibson said. ``She,
like us kids, knew her place. She shut up,'' she said.
   Mrs. Gibson, who said she left home at age 18, said she never
heard her father say he loved her mother.
   A son, Al Copeland of Chillicothe, said he and a brother
approached their father in 1986 when the elder Copelands were on
the verge of bankruptcy. He said they offered financial help but
Ray Copeland responded: ``Stay out of my damned business.''
   He said his father treated his mother ``a lot worse than
trash.''
   ``My father tried to dominate me and my family, in lifestyle and
work,'' Al Copeland said.
   The defense claimed Mrs. Copeland did not take part in the
murders and was unaware of her husband's business dealings.
   But Livingston County prosecutor Doug Roberts called the
Copelands ``20th-century cattle rustlers'' who made $32,000 through
their scheme.
   ``If we don't seek the death penalty after one of the worst - if
not the worst - cases of serial murder in the state's history, when
do we seek it?'' he asked.
   Roberts said the Copelands, who lived on a small farm near
Chillicothe, about 90 miles northeast of Kansas City, had the five
victims write bad checks to buy cattle, then resold the cattle,
kept the proceeds and killed the men before the checks could be
traced.
   The men's bodies were found in October 1989 near farms where
Copeland had done odd jobs, after a tip from another drifter who
had worked for the couple. All had been shot in the head.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Claims Victory, Opposition Cries Fraud in State Elxn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>

   The governing party claimed overwhelming
victories in two major state elections that tested its promise of
electoral reform, but the opposition charged the party resorted
once again to fraud.
   Abstention appeared to be the biggest factor in Sunday's
elections for 121 city hall slates and 34 local congressional
district seats in Mexico state.
   About 70 percent of the voters either stayed home or passed by
the polls on their way to soccer games, movies or drives in the
country. The low turnout favors the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has superior resources to mobilize its
supporters.
   Mexico state, which includes many of this vast capital's suburbs
- rich, poor and middle class - is the country's wealthiest and
most populous state, with more than 10 million people and 4.5
million voters.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was soundly defeated there
during 1988 elections.
   For opposition parties, the election tests Salinas' promises to
reform the ruling party's much-maligned electoral practices.
   The ruling party, known by its Spanish initials PRI, had
controlled all but two of the 121 city halls in the state before
the election.
   Early Monday it claimed to have won in 119 municipalities,
including Naucalpan, the richest in the country. It did not give
the names of the towns it lost.
   The party also claimed victory in 22 of the 84 city hall races
in neighboring Hidalgo state, which has about 1 million voters. The
status of the other towns wasn't immediately known.
   No results were available from the congressional elections.
Mexico's congress has little power.
   Official results in both states will be announced Sunday.
   The voting in Mexico state was characterized by minor clashes
between sympathizers of different parties, late openings at some
polling places and at least one report of a stolen ballot box.
   The conservative National Action Party, or PAN by its Spanish
initials, charged the PRI was using ``terrible fraud'' to take
Naucalpan, a northwest Mexico City suburb with a population of
800,000.
   ``Definitely there was fraud; the elections were not fair,''
said Luis Felipe Bravo, PAN's mayoral candidate.
   The center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party, founded by
dissident PRI leaders, also claimed the PRI used intimidation to
win Naucalpan.
   An exit poll done by the private Public Opinion Studies Center
for the newspaper La Jornada showed the PRI with 36 percent of the
Naucalpan vote and PAN with 35 percent. It said the poll had a 2
percent margin of error.
   About 200 PAN activists blocked the road to the election
commission offices in the city of Cuautitlan, demanding a recount
and refusing to let the ruling party commission chairman leave, the
independent Excelsior news service reported.
   The commission chairman, Jesus Reyes, told Excelsior the PAN's
mayoral candidate had a 450-vote lead over the PRI candidate.
Cuautitlan, a northern suburb, has about 50,000 residents.
   As the ruling party for 61 years, the PRI has become entrenched
in power and invariably faces charges of high-handed maneuvering,
even from its own members, who criticize arbitrary methods of
picking candidates.
   This year, in the face of voter cynicism, the party pledged to
modernize and recognize electoral victories by the opposition.

   Snow was scattered from the Great Lakes into New England on
Monday, while temperatures in parts of Montana, Wyoming and South
Dakota soared to unseasonably warm levels.
   At midday, snow showers extended across central New England,
east-central New York state, western New York state, central and
northwestern Pennsylvania, northeastern Ohio and eastern Upper
Michigan.
   At sunrise, 10 inches of snow had accumulated in upstate New
York at Boonville, about 50 miles east of Lake Ontario, and Barnes
Corners, about 20 miles from the lake. The region gets heavy snow
because storms pick up moisture from the lake. In the same general
area, Lowville got 6 inches.
   Elsewhere in upstate New York, about 3 inches of snow fell
overnight in the western Mohawk Valley, western Catskills and
Susquehanna region, and an additional 6 inches of snow was
possible.
   Snowfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included 2 inches
at Montpelier, Vt.; and 1 inch at Binghamton, N.Y., and Sault Ste.
Marie, Mich.
   The Vermont Highway Department reported extremely hazardous
driving conditions over north-central and northeastern parts of the
state.
   Rain was only scattered over the northern Pacific Coast, after
three days of steady rain last week caused flooding in northwestern
Washington.
   The Snohomish River at Snohomish was about 1\ feet above flood
stage, the Skagit River at Concrete was more than 2 feet above
flood state, and the Skagit River at Mount Vernon was more than 3
feet above flood stage.
   In northwestern Alaska, wind gusted to 40 mph along the coast of
Kotzebue Sound, producing heavy drifting snow and wind chill
temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.
   East of the Continental Divide, temperatures across the upper
Missouri Valley and northern Plains reached nearly 30 degrees
higher than normal for mid-November.
   Cheyenne, Wyo., tied its record of 70; Great Falls, Mont., hit a
record 71; Havre, Mont., warmed to a record 74; and Rapid City,
S.D., hit a record 77. Havre's previous record of 68 had stood
since 1905.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 8 above zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont., west of the Divide.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 20 at
Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 92 at Palm Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>Black Homeland Detains 32 ANC Members; 7 Blacks Die in Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities in the
Bophuthatswana black homeland on Monday detained at least 32
members of the African National Congress in a crackdown that
coincided with a work boycott by ANC-affiliated groups.
   Homeland President Lucas Mangope accused the ANC of plotting to
kill him and overthrow the government, a charge the ANC dismissed
as ``absurd.''
   It said the crackdown was part of a pattern of repression going
on in Bophuthatswana.
   Thousands of blacks stayed home from work Monday in Pretoria,
the South African capital, to protest electricity cuts in nearby
black townships.
   Authorities shut off electricity last week because residents
refused to pay their bills to protest living conditions.
   Police said seven blacks died in scattered violence in
Johannesburg area, including five in a faction fight in Katlehong
township to the southeast.
   Organizers said the one-day work boycott also was designed to
express opposition to the government in Bophuthatswana, near
Pretoria.
   Activists consider South Africa's 10 tribal homelands part of
the apartheid system of racial segregation. They want the four
homelands with nominal independence - Transkei, Ciskei, Venda and
Bophuthatswana - to be reincorporated into South Africa.
   Mangope refuses to consider rejoining South Africa despite
mounting opposition to his rule.
   He claimed over state-run Radio Bophuthatswana he had evidence
of the alleged ANC plot to overthrow the government. Police
Commissioner Maj. Gen. P.J. Seleke said 32 ANC members were
detained Monday in response.
   ``It is surely no coincidence that (Mangope's) absurd claim that
there is an ANC plot to assassinate him comes on the day when
thousands of people have stayed away from work in response to a
call,'' by ANC-affiliated groups, an ANC statement said.
   In Transkei, Ciskei and Venda, army members have staged coups
and developed good relations with the ANC. Only South Africa
recognizes the sovereignty of the so-called independent homelands.
   Most black workers in Pretoria took part in Monday's work
action, forcing shops that employ blacks to rely on white staff.
   Residents and police clashed Saturday in Atteridgeville
township, leaving two people dead and 18 injured. The government
Sunday imposed a 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew and gave police expanded
powers in Atteridgeville and nearby Saulsville.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of ANC deputy president Nelson Mandela, on
Monday visited the homes of the two people killed.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd at one home as she
arrived. The choking gas visibly affected Mrs. Mandela and
journalists gathered there.
   Police spokeswoman Lt. Ida van Zweel said that in Katlehong
township, Xhosa and Zulu tribal members battled with guns and
knives at a squatter camp.
   Also, a man was hacked to death and set afire in Sebokeng, south
of Johannesburg. In Jouberton, southwest of the city, a youth died
when police fired on group throwing gasoline bombs at a policeman's
house.

   Manuel Noriega and Cable News Network declared a
cease-fire Monday, agreeing to postpone their constitutional
showdown over taped conversations until the U.S. Supreme Court
rules on the issue.
   Under the deal is worked out in federal court, CNN must refrain
from playing any tapes between the imprisoned former Panamanian
leader and his attorneys.
   In return, Noriega's defense delayed a request for contempt
penalties of up to $300,000 per broadcast against the network. U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler also delayed his order demanding
that CNN hand over seven disputed tapes to the court.
   ``Our concern is to keep General Noriega from being denied a
fair trial,'' defense attorney Jon May said. ``I'm not here to
squeeze blood out of CNN.''
   He said suspending the contempt proceedings will allow the
Supreme Court to focus on the broader constitutional question
balancing protections of the attorney-client privilege and freedom
of speech.
   Noriega's attorneys Saturday asked the judge to find CNN in
contempt after the network defied his court order and televised a
contested tape.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the deal,
but had the right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they did
not include conversations with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
   The Atlanta-based network is expected to file its appeal to the
Supreme Court later in the week, a CNN spokesman said.
   ``We agreed that CNN would not air, pending Supreme Court
review, any attorney-client conversations that it has in its
possession,'' network attorney Terry Bienstock said. ``We just want
the issues to be narrowly and properly framed before the Supreme
Court.''
   Federal prosecutors have remained on the sidelines during the
CNN-Noriega dispute, but U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Monday
he supports the gag order.
   ``These tapes should not be played under the fair-trial
concept,'' Lehtinen told the judge.
   May said Monday's deal stops the clock on the contempt
penalties, but does not prevent the defense from later asking for
fines against CNN.
   Although attention has focused on the media, May said there are
also other potential parties to the dispute.
   ``There's a whole bunch of people in the U.S. who may have these
tapes, including the State Department and the CIA,'' he said. Lead
Noriega attorney Frank Rubino has said the tapes were leaked to CNN
by a Panamanian official who received them from the State
Department.
   Rubino has said he expects to ask for dismissal of all charges
against Noriega based on government misconduct in recording the
calls made from the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
   Hoeveler endorsed the deal, but took note of CNN's one-day
defiance of his previous gag order. He emphasized that over the
weekend the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta backed
his original ban on broadcasting the conversations.
   ``If you play any tapes in violation of my order, you are
violating not only my order, but also the appeals court order,''
Hoeveler said.
   CNN had defied the order by broadcasting an excerpt Friday night
and Saturday in which the deposed Panamanian ruler spoke in Spanish
with a secretary for Rubino. On the tape, Noriega speculated that
the government would use as witnesses against him two men who
surrendered to U.S. troops in Panama.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held near Miami
since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly after the invasion of
Panama in December.

   The International Committee of the Red
Cross said a cease-fire between warring Moslem militias enabled it
to deliver food and medicine Monday to an embattled region in south
Lebanon.
   Four trucks and 12 ambulances brought 15 tons of food and
medication to the bomb-shattered villages of Gbaa and Ein Qana, in
Iqlim Al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, reporters who traveled with the
convoy said.
   The two hamlets are controlled by the Iranian-backed
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God. The Swiss Red Cross
agency brought 11 wounded Hezbollah fighters from Gbaa to Beirut.
   Hezbollah and the rival pro-Syrian Amal militia signed a peace
accord brokered by Syria and Iran last week to halt a three-year
war for control over Lebanon's 1.2 million-strong Shiite Moslem
community.
   A Syrian army officer and a delegate of the Iranian Embassy in
Beirut traveled with the ICRC convoy to the Apple Province,
southeast of the city of Sidon.

   Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark met
Monday with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who told Clark he hoped
there would be no showdown with the United States, the Iraqi news
agency said.
   Saddam also told Clark: ``We should all work for the sake of
peace,'' the official agency said.
   Clark, who said he came here for three days to learn Iraq's
position and to help win the release of hostages, also met with
senior figures from the ruling Baath Party, including Deputy Prime
Minister Taha Hussein Ramadan.
   His anti-war statements were given extensive coverage on Iraqi
television and in local newspapers. It was the first visit by a
recognized U.S. figure since Jesse Jackson came here in August.
   ``I am here to impress the government that the people who want
to leave should be able to do so. I have a civil rights background
and I think violation of individual rights could create tensions
and difficulties,'' Clark said.
   ``It is an inflammable issue. If you want peace you should value
everyone's rights,'' he said.
   He said the U.S. government was rushing to a military solution
and should try negotiations.
   ``Unwillingness to talk is never acceptable. You must not lose
complete communication with an enemy because ignorance can cause
mistakes,'' he said.
   In 1980, Clark attended a ``Crimes of America'' conference in
Iran while Americans were being held hostage in the U.S. Embassy.
After serving as attorney general under President Johnson, Clark
went to North Vietnam in 1972 to view the effects of American
bombing.

<TEXT>
   A detective said Monday that the
suitcase holding the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 in
December 1988 could not be matched to any of the passengers aboard.
   Det. Constable Derek Henderson said the suitcase probably was on
the flight when it left Frankfurt, Germany.
   The Boeing 747 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270
people on board the craft and in the town.
   Henderson said investigators set about matching passengers to
all the bags in baggage container AVE 4041, which contained the
bomb.
   He testified at a fatal accident inquiry presided over by Lord
Fraser, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, that one item listed was a
bronze Samsonite suitcase that inquiries among relatives failed to
match to any passenger.
   ``The conclusion I would draw is that the suitcase containing
the IED (improvised explosive device) came from the feeder flight
103A from Frankfurt,'' he said.
   Henderson also testified that no drugs were found in the luggage
of passenger Khalid Jaafar, 21, of suburban Detroit, who was
returning from Lebanon.
   Reports on NBC and ABC television last month said terrorists may
have penetrated a Drug Enforcement Administration undercover
investigation to put explosives on the flight.
   The networks said terrorists might have substituted baggage
containing bombs for suitcases loaded with heroin that DEA placed
on U.S.-bound planes to track the routes of Lebanese drug
traffickers smuggling drugs to Detroit.
   Bags belonging to U.S. passengers Charles McKee and Matthew
Gannon, who flew into Frankfurt from Cyprus, were unlikely to have
been switched either, Henderson said.
   It was earlier suggested at the inquiry that McKee and Gannon
may have been CIA agents.

   The way Denys Arcand tells it, his award-winning
films like ``The Decline of the American Empire'' were just a
diversion. This week he debuts in the role he always wanted: stage
director.
   ``The theater has been a sort of secret love of mine -
forever,'' said Arcand, 49, as he dug into his fast-food chicken
lunch in the lobby of Theatre de Quat'Sous, where Les Lettres de la
Religieuse Portugaise (The Portuguese Nun's Letters) was opening
Monday night.
   ``I think I see more plays in a year than movies, really. It's
not that I don't like movies, but good ones are few and far
between,'' he said.
   As a history graduate from the University of Montreal, Denys'
first job was as a researcher at the National Film Board. Later he
began making documentary films about such topics as the textile
industry, municipal politics and life in a strip joint.
   His first dramatic film was released in 1986. ``The Decline of
the American Empire,'' a treatise on the sexual obsessions of
middle-class intellectuals, won numerous awards, as did his 1989
film ``Jesus of Montreal.''
   Most of the cast of ``Jesus'' was drawn from the ranks of the
Montreal theater scene, Arcand said. ``I think theater is the art
form that is most alive in Quebec,'' he said.
   ``Les Lettres de la Religieuse Portugaise'' is shaped around the
apparently genuine letters written by a Portuguese woman to the
French lieutenant who left her. The letters were published
anonymously in 1669.

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister David Lange
said Tuesday that all 16 New Zealand hostages in Iraq and occupied
Kuwait will be released.
   At a news conference at Parliament, Lange, joined by relatives
of some of those held, said the hostages - six in Iraq and 10 in
Kuwait - will assemble in Baghdad and then travel to Amman, Jordan.
He said it would probably take two days.
   ``It was just before I left from Singapore that I heard it from
Baghdad,'' he said.
   Lange had a short stay in Singapore on his return to New
Zealand.
   He said Sunday night before leaving Amman that he was told by
Iraq's first deputy prime minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, to expect
good news on his return to New Zealand.
   In Iraq, Lange held talks with Ramadan, No. 3 in the Iraqi
government, and National Assembly speaker Saadi Mehdi Saleh.
   Lange went to Iraq following a plea by the families of New
Zealanders who were trapped when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   The former Labor prime minister told Radio New Zealand on Monday
that adverse reaction from the United States about his visit was a
great help in his negotiations.
   The United States has complained that the stream of senior
statesmen pleading for the release of their nationals was a
propaganda victory for President Saddam Hussein.
   Asked if he had any qualms about the ``propaganda potential'' of
such visits to Baghdad, Lange responded:
   ``One of the curious things about the United States is that it
criticized my visit, which was a great help in Baghdad.
   ``The other thing is the argument of the United States that the
hostages in Iraq are a potential deterrent to the use of force by
the United States and associated troops. It therefore seems quite
extraordinary that they should protest against the removal of
them.''
   Lange arrived home Tuesday in time for the release of a book he
has written on New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy, which caused a
rift in relations with Washington in 1986.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three strikes doesn't mean you're out to former
Mayor Jane Byrne, who on Monday became the first announced
candidate for mayor next year.
   Byrne, who served as mayor from 1979 to 1983 but lost her last
three political races, likely will challenge first-term Mayor
Richard M. Daley in the city's Democratic primary next Feb. 5.
Daley hasn't announced his intentions but is expected to seek
re-election. Many observers regard him as unbeatable.
   Byrne, 56, told a news conference that Daley ``hides from
responsibility'' while rising crime, a poorly run public health
system and high taxes tarnish Chicago's reputation as an attractive
place to live and do business.
   ``Instead of a leader in City Hall, we have a person who hides
from responsibility, blames others, such as the federal government,
and speaks to us in nothing more than 30-second sound bites in a
carefully controlled and screened setting - as if everything is
rosy,'' she said.
   But experts say the future in running this city of 3 million
people is indeed rosy for the son of Mayor Richard J. Daley.
   The current Mayor Daley, 47, won a two-year term in a 1989
special election to fill the remainder of the late Harold
Washington's term.
   A Chicago Sun-Times poll published Nov. 1 found 58 percent of
Chicagoans rated Daley's job performance as excellent or good. The
poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.
   Republican Gov. James R. Thompson predicted last week that Daley
would be re-elected.
   And political analyst Don Rose, who ran Byrne's winning 1979
campaign, said she lacks the support to win this time.
   ``I think there is a very general sense that Daley is unbeatable
in 1991,'' Rose said.
   Byrne was eliminated in the 1983 mayoral primary, when with
Daley she split the white vote and Washington, the third primary
candidate, went on to become the city's first black mayor. Byrne
lost to Washington in the 1987 primary.
   She also lost a primary bid in 1988 for clerk of theCook County
Circuit Court.

   The government has executed an alleged
CIA spy who was part of a network that provided Washington with
information during the Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic News
Agency said Monday.
   The Tehran news agency, monitored in Nicosia, identified the
alleged agent as Seyyed Mohammad Ali Shahbukhari.
   It quoted Tehran's military prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Mohammad
Niazi, as saying Shahbukhari was ``a citizen of a neighboring
country.'' He did not elaborate, but Shahbukhari is a traditional
Afghan name.
   Shahbukhari and other spies provided military information to the
Central Intelligence Agency during the 1980-88 war, Niazi said.
   Shahbukhari was tried and convicted by a military tribunal and
his death sentence was approved by the Supreme Court, he said.
   There were no details on the dates of the arrest, or on the
status of the unknown number of people arrested with Shahbukhari.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani disclosed in April 1989
that security forces had smashed an alleged CIA ring. The New York
Times later quoted U.S. officials as confirming a CIA network
working in Iran had collapsed.

   A small plane crashed Monday at the Pitkin
County airport, killing all four people on board, authorities said.
   The Cessna 210 plane slammed into a hill just off the runway,
apparently while taking off, said Dee Tatum, spokeswoman for
Sheriff Bob Braudis. It did not catch fire.
   The sheriff confirmed the four deaths shortly after the crash
and authorities worked during the afternoon to remove the bodies,
Tatum said.
   She said no attempt to identify the victims would be made until
the bodies were removed.

   Police and volunteers flying in
glider planes, hang gliders and helicopters tossed millions of tree
and plant seeds into Brazil's Atlantic Forest to reforest Rio's
ravaged wilderness.
   About 92 million seeds were dropped Sunday from 40 helicopters
and 12 glider planes and hang gliders into three of Rio's national
forests to begin the city's ``Dress Rio in Green'' environmental
campaign.
   The $320,000 campaign was planned shortly after Rio was chosen
as the host city of the 1992 United Nations World Environment
Conference.
   The seeds, donated by the Sao Paulo Forestry Institute, are
expected to form a lower brush cover needed for such native
Brazilian trees as the jequitibas and peroba to grow quickly.
   ``We don't know up to what point this will bring practical
results, but it sure is worth the effort,'' said Abelardo Coimbra
Bueno, 26, who flew his hang glider over Rio's mountains to drop
dozens of sacks of seeds into forest clearings.
   Five people in hang gliders soared over Rio's mountaintop Tijuca
Forest, and dumped nearly 1 million seeds into the world's largest
urban park, which sprawls over famed Corcovado Mountain.
   The dense forest, almost completely destroyed a century ago
before being replanted with native trees, was recently named a
national heritage park by President Fernando Collor de Mello.

   Police on Monday arrested 10 Greenpeace activists
for hanging a banner atop Tower Bridge to protest British plans to
conduct nuclear tests in Nevada.
   The activists included five people who held the safety ropes and
five others who were suspended 140 feet above the Thames River to
hang the enormous banner reading ``Stop UK Nuclear Tests.''
Greenpeace expected the group to be charged with disturbing the
peace.
   The British environmental group said it received leaked
information last weekend that the test would be conducted
underground Wednesday.
   The Defense Ministry said only: ``We don't say anything about
testing beforehand.''
   But in Las Vegas, the U.S. Department of Energy on Monday
confirmed plans for the eighth announced test this year.
   DOE spokesman Jim Boyer said the 20-150 kiloton weapon would be
exploded at 9 a.m. Wednesday about 1,900 feet beneath the surface
of Pahute Mesa, about 105 miles northwest of Las Vegas. He would
not say whether Britain was involved in the test.
   In the last British test, in December, xenon and krypton gas and
a small amount of radioactivity leaked into the atmosphere,
according to the Energy Department. The explosion, monitored at the
California Institute of Technology seismology laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., created a shock measuring 5.4 on the Richter
scale.
   The Defense Ministry said Monday there was a ``minor seepage''
about eight days after the explosion. The spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the leak was not unusual and that it
did not constitute a health hazard on or off the test site.
   Nevada Gov. Bob Miller has complained about the Energy
Department's delay in reporting leaks to the people of his state.
The department recently agreed to report all leaks, no matter how
small.
   Britain has conducted 17 nuclear tests in Nevada since signing a
1958 agreement with the United States.
   ``We, obviously, feel that U.S. citizens should not be put
downwind of the British nuclear program,'' said Rebecca Johnson,
the Greenpeace test ban coordinator. ``That is exactly what is
happening as shown by last year's test.''
   Greenpeace also expressed anger at the timing of the British
test weeks before a conference in New York to discuss a worldwide
ban on underground nuclear testing.
   Forty non-aligned nations out of 118 countries that have signed
the partial test ban treaty have called the meeting for Jan. 7-8
under the auspices of the United Nations. The treaty, first signed
in 1963, bans tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in outer
space but permits underground testing.
   The nations gathering in New York hope to convince the United
States, Britain and the Soviet Union to ban underground tests. U.S.
and British officials oppose the ban. The Soviets have said they
will not unilaterally end the testing.

   Hundreds of masked youths battled police and set 30
cars ablaze Monday as police in Paris blocked the route of more
than 100,000 students demanding better conditions at their high
schools.
   It was the worst violence in a month of nationwide student
protests.
   Riot police fired water cannons and hundreds of rounds of tear
gas at demonstrators, who pelted officers with rocks and bottles,
smashed windows and looted stores.
   Police headquarters said 104 officers were hurt, including 18
hospitalized. Police reported 52 arrests in Paris, and a dozen
youths arrested for vandalism during a protest march in
Montbelaird, eastern France.
   In all, about 100 vehicles were damaged in Paris, police said.
   About 150,000 students took part in demonstrations elsewhere in
France.
   President Francois Mitterrand promised steps would be taken to
address student demands. They want more government spending to
improve security, upgrade substandard facilities, modernize
curricula and hire more teachers.
   The main throng of protesters in Paris was orderly, but hundreds
of youths on the fringes ran wild. Many rioters wore masks and
carried clubs.
   Journalists were beaten.
   Mitterrand and Education Minister Lionel Jospin met with a
delegation of student leaders and promised an emergency plan in
response to demands for better education and safety on campus.
   Monday's march began at the Place de la Bastille in eastern
Paris, where 201 years ago rioters stormed the prison to start the
French Revolution. In the Montparnasse neighborhood of southern
Paris, gangs started smashing windows and robbing street vendors
about two hours after the march started.
   Police Chief Pierre Verbrugghe, who deployed 5,000 officers,
told students they would not be allowed to follow their planned
route and finish their march on the Champs Elysees.
   Many students obeyed the orders, but a few hundred youths
squared off against police at the Alma bridge. Police fired water
cannons when they tried to cross, scattering the rioters who hurled
rocks and trash.
   The youths regrouped and repeated attempts to break through
police line. Vandals set fire to trash and dismantled bus stops.
   Jospin promised more discussions with student leaders Tuesday
and throughout the week, and said such talks should be held on the
local level as well.
   Organizers claimed 200,000 students joined the Paris march, but
other observers estimated the turnout at closer to 100,000. It was
the first time students from the provinces were urged to join a
march in the capital.
   Those who couldn't come to Paris staged their own protests in
dozens of smaller cities.
   Dozens of previous student marches and rallies across France
over the past four weeks have been peaceful, except for sporadic
vandalism blamed by student leaders on provocateurs.
   On Nov. 5, an estimated 150,000 students participated in marches
nationwide.
   The protests began with student strikes last month in the tough
northern suburbs of Paris after the gang rape of a girl in a school
lavatory and assaults on teachers. Protesters have complained of
drug trafficking, theft and extortion on campus.
   Most protesters come from relatively low-income families, and
many are children of immigrants. They view education as the key to
advancement, and resent a seemingly second-class treatment of
schools in the high-rise slums that ring many major cities.
   ``I'm from a bourgeois neighborhood, so our problems with
security and infrastructure are not that great,'' said marcher
Fabien Liabastre, 16, of Sceaux. ``But even our school has wire
hanging out of the wall and water leaks throughout the ceiling.''
   The students have broad public support and the government has
proposed increasing the education budget by 9 percent in 1991. But
students worry that improvements won't come quickly enough to help
them win university admission or decent jobs.

   A drug being given to post-menopausal women along
with the hormone estrogen could be undercutting the beneficial
effects of estrogen on the heart, doctors said Monday.
   Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of the University of California,
San Diego, said that uncertainty surrounds the use of progestin in
women receiving estrogen therapy after menopause.
   Progestin is a drug with the same action as the naturally
occurring hormone progesterone.
   Rampratap S. Kushwaha of the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical
Research in San Antonio reported that progestin boosted cholesterol
levels in baboons whose ovaries had been removed.
   Estrogen and progesterone are the two main hormones produced in
the ovaries, and production of both drops almost to zero after
menopause.
   Estrogen is given to help reduce the hot flashes caused by the
loss of the hormone production. Since the 1970s, when it was shown
that giving a woman estrogen could increase her risk of uterine
cancer, progesterone has been used to reduce that cancer risk,
Barrett-Connor said.
   But estrogen also protects women against heart disease. Without
estrogen, their risk of heart disease climbs sharply after
menopause, becoming similar to that of men after a few years.
   Barrett-Connor was one of several researchers who called for
more research on heart disease in women.
   At a news conference during the annual scientific meeting of the
American Heart Association, the researchers said that many
questions, such as how to use estrogen and progesterone in
post-menopausal women, can't be answered without new studies.
   Barrett-Connor said, for example, that older women have higher
blood pressure and cholesterol on average than do men, but they
still have lower risks of heart disease. Researchers do not know
why.
   John LaRosa of George Washington University Medical Center said
the fat that women often carry on their hips may raise their heart
disease risk less than fat carried around the abdomen, as is more
common in men.
   Charles Hennekens of Harvard Medical School cautioned, however,
that ``obesity in women is a major public health problem.''
   A woman who is 10 percent above average weight has an 80 percent
higher risk of heart disease, he said. A woman who is 20 percent
above average weight has a 230 percent higher risk of heart
disease.

   Playboy is not on the list. But Bowling
Digest is. So is Life, Snowmobile, and Football Card Magazine.
   Concerned that some reading material sent to troops in Saudi
Arabia is not making it through Saudi customs, publisher Timothy
Karnes decided to do something about it.
   So Karnes, who publishes Auction Guide magazine, has organized
Operation Desert News, a non-profit effort to get magazines to the
troops.
   Working with the Defense Department and magazine publishers,
he's making plans to ship thousands of magazines directly to forces
in Saudi Arabia late this month.
   The publications have been screened by the military to make sure
the contents are not offensive to the Saudis. References to
alcohol, articles on religious beliefs and photos of women that
show a lot of skin are all considered objectionable.
   ``What to you is a woman in a bathing suit or a man in a bathing
suit is pornography to them,'' said Maj. Lon Oakley, of the public
affairs office of the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force
Base in Tampa, Fla.
   Current issues of 31 magazines have been cleared for shipment.
Some are production overruns, Karnes said.
   The magazines will be given new covers decorated in camouflage
and bearing the names of corporate sponsors who are helping finance
the project. The new covers will prevent the magazines from being
resold on the black market, Karnes said.
   ``I got the idea a couple of months ago that maybe magazines
that were going to be destroyed (by the publishers) could be sent
over there,'' he said.
   Publications approved for shipment include Adventure Comics,
Bowling Digest, Baseball America, Inside Sports, Life, The Nation,
Space Cadet, World Monitor and Snowmobile.
   ``Snowmobile doesn't have a lot of women showing a lot of
skin,'' Karnes said.
   Karnes hopes the first shipment of about 200,000 magazines will
be ready late this month. Some publishers, he said, have even
agreed to make additional production runs to help the effort.
   Auction Guide is a magazine about auctions in the Southeast and
is sold on newsstands in seven states, Karnes said.

   A Vietnam veterans group in Florida
said Monday it has lost patience with federal government efforts to
study the effects of Agent Orange and will conduct its own survey
on exposure to the toxic defoliant.
   ``This state - the Vietnam veterans of Florida - have said
enough is enough,'' said David Kaufman, a veteran from Fort
Lauderdale. ``We're going to take the bull by the horns.''
   Florida, with about 527,000 Vietnam veterans, is the first state
to attempt such a project, according to Kaufman, chairman of the
Agent Orange Committee of the Vietnam Veterans of Florida.
   The survey has the backing of national Vietnam veterans groups
and individual scientists at the Department for Veterans Affairs,
the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease
Control, Kaufman said.
   ``There are scientists and epidemiolgists who work for the VA
and the EPA who are outraged at this latest CDC fiasco,'' Kaufman
told reporters.
   A congressional study released last month charged that the CDC
misspent $6.6 million while conducting a disputed study of the
effects of Agent Orange.
   An estimated 12 million gallons of Agent Orange, composed
primarily of cancer-causing dioxin, was sprayed over Vietnam by
U.S. troops between 1965 and 1970 to destroy the jungle that hid
the enemy.
   Veterans groups say exposure to Agent Orange has been linked to
19 types of cancer and other health problems, including birth
defects. Earlier this year, the VA decided to award compensation to
veterans with two rare cancers, soft-tissue sarcoma and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to Agent Orange.
   Since 1981, some lower-income veterans who believe their health
problems are caused by Agent Orange have received VA care, the VA
said.
   But the veterans are a long way from getting the government to
acknowledge that Agent Orange has caused lingering diseases in
veterans and birth defects in their children, veterans groups say.
   The CDC has said that military records did not identify veterans
who had been exposed to the chemical.
   ``We're going to provide them with information,'' Kaufman said.
   He said there are 116 scientists from the VA, CDC and EPA ``who
have pledged that if we get them the surveys they will go through
them.'' Those scientists, whom Kaufman would not name, also helped
write the 116-question survey, he said.
   The organization has printed only 1,000 surveys thus far. It
wants to get 500,000 distributed and returned within six months.
Kaufman said it will cost about $3 million to conduct the survey,
and that veterans would have to raise money as they go to pay for
the project.
   About 200 surveys were handed out Monday to veterans gathered
for Veterans Day ceremonies at the group's Tallahassee
headquarters, Kaufman said.

   Doctors conducted lab tests Monday to
determine what caused the sudden death of 13-year-old Stormie
Jones, the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient.
   It will take one to two weeks to complete the tests, including
organ tissue cultures to search for viruses or bacteria, said Lynn
McMahon, a spokeswoman at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Stormie went into cardiac arrest and died Sunday morning at the
hospital after rapidly declining during the night.
   She endured organ rejection and hepatitis after her historic
double transplant on Valentine's Day 1984 and a second liver
transplant in February.
   ``We've been able to provide better quality of life and longer
life for many people'' because of Stormie's ordeal, Dr. Jorge
Reyes, staff physician at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said
after she died.
   Preliminary autopsy results were inconclusive, but Reyes said
that if Stormie had a flu virus, her death could have been caused
by a rapid or irregular heartbeat.
   Transplant patients are susceptible to infection because
anti-rejection drugs to protect the transplant weaken the immune
system.
   Stormie was taken from her home in White Settlement, Texas - a
Fort Worth suburb - to a Texas hospital Saturday night with a sore
throat and fever. She then was flown to the Pittsburgh hospital,
which had conducted the transplants.
   Her condition did not appear serious then, but it deteriorated
rapidly, Ms. McMahon said.
   Stormie was known for her generosity to other patients at
Children's Hospital, where Ms. McMahon said it was ``really very
solemn'' Monday.
   ``There's still a great deal of shock,'' Ms. McMahon said.
   ``She went through a lot of pain, you know, as a guinea pig and
as necessity,'' her stepfather, Alan Purcell, said at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport en route to Pittsburgh. ``The pain is
over with. She doesn't hurt any more.''
   Purcell told hospital officials Monday that Stormie's mother,
Lois Purcell, was ``holding up'' despite her grief, said Sue
Cardillo, another hospital spokeswoman.
   Ms. Cardillo said Stormie's body was not being held for further
autopsy, but she did not know whether the body had been returned to
Texas.
   Students at Brewer Middle School in White Settlement mourned
their classmate, who had attended class there a few weeks in the
fall before being forced home by medical problems.
   The students decided to rename the gymnasium the Stormie Jones
Gym and to hang her portrait in the hallway. An oak tree was
planted in front of the school Monday as a living memorial to the
seventh-grader.
   Stormie was 6 when she became the first person to receive a
transplanted heart and liver at the same time. Since then,
University of Pittsburgh hospitals have performed at least 10 other
transplants involving the liver and another organ.
   Most multiple-organ transplants in the United States have been
performed at the university's hospitals, the only ones authorized
to use FK-506, the experimental anti-rejection drug Stormie was
taking.
   Stormie required the first multiple transplant because her own
organs were harmed by familial hypercholesterolemia - a condition
in which her body produced blood cholesterol at a rate 10 times
higher than normal.
   Funeral arrangements were pending. A memorial service will be
held at the hospital Nov. 21, Ms. McMahon said.

   Demands grew Monday to let diplomacy rather than military force
help solve the Persian Gulf crisis, and Arab nations discussed
holding an Arab summit that Saddam Hussein has said he might
attend.
   Oil prices fell $2.02 a barrel, closing in New York at $31.87,
as traders decided that rising supplies posed a greater immediate
threat than war.
   Gold fell $4.10 an ounce in New York, closing at $382.30, and
the Dow Jones industrial average soared 51.74 points to close at
2,540.35.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said Egyptian soldiers would
not enter Iraq, even if U.S. and other troops attacked. But he said
his troops would enter Kuwait as a peacekeeping force.
   In Washington, lawmakers urged the U.S. administration to back
away from its war rhetoric.
   ``If George Bush wants his presidency to die in the Arabian
desert, he's going at it very steadily and as if it were a plan,''
said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater complained, ``Not a
shot's been fired. What are these guys talking about?''
   Fitzwater said President Bush would work closely with Congress
on the crisis, but might be forced to order military action on his
own in case of ``unforeseen kinds of provocations.''
   King Hassan II of Morocco on Sunday proposed he host an Arab
summit within the next week as a ``last chance'' for peace. Some
nations endorsed that call, and Saddam said he might attend if
consulted on the timing and agenda.
   Saddam said the summit should discuss linking the Arab-Israeli
dispute to any decision over Kuwait, which Iraq invaded and
occupied on Aug. 2 in a dispute over land, oil and money.
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, meeting
Monday in Baghdad, backed the call for an Arab summit.
   But several Arab leaders had not responded and prospects for an
early summit seemed dim.
   The last Arab summit in August ended in disarray. Mubarak last
week rejected a proposal by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
for an Arab summit, saying the Arabs were too divided to hold a
productive session.
   Also controversial was Saddam's insistence on tying his
withdrawal from Kuwait to withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. The United States and its allies have said Iraq
must withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait and the issues must be
dealt with separately.
   In Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, Secretary-General Abdullah Bishara of
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council said Morocco's call for an
emergency Arab summit came too late.
   Bishara, a Kuwaiti national, told a news conference war was
inescapable because ``diplomacy alone will never achieve its
objectives.''
   He said war was the only language the Iraqis understood.
   The council groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the
United Arab Emirates and Oman.
   New Zealand's former prime minister, David Lange, said Tuesday
that all 16 New Zealand hostages in Iraq and Kuwait will be
released, probably within two days.
   Lange spoke at a news conference in Wellington after returning
from talks in Baghdad. He told Radio New Zealand on Monday that
U.S. criticism of his trip was a ``great help'' in his negotiations
in the Iraqi capital.
   Washington says the stream of senior statesmen pleading for the
release of their citizens is a propaganda victory for Saddam.
   The United Nations imposed trade sanctions on Iraq to force its
withdrawal from Kuwait, but two Middle East experts in Washington
said it was unlikely sanctions alone would work.
   In a report for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy,
Patrick Clawson said he believed Iraq could survive sanctions
through late 1991.
   James A. Phillips of the Heritage Foundation said that for
Saddam, withdrawal would mean ``a humiliating defeat that will
threaten his personal power and perhaps survival.''
   The United States has deployed 230,000 troops in Saudi Arabia as
part of a more than 300,000-strong multinational force arrayed
against Iraq, and Bush last week announced plans to send about
200,000 more soldiers.
   When Secretary of State James A. Baker III visited Cairo last
week, a senior U.S. official said the United States was confident
Egypt would fight alongside U.S. forces if war broke out.
   But asked by his party's newspaper, Mayo, if Egypt would send
troops to Iraq following a U.S.-led attack, Mubarak said:
   ``No, we have nothing to do with Iraq.'' But if the anti-Iraq
allies invaded Kuwait, he said, ``We do not mind at all entering
Kuwait as peacekeeping forces ... although I do not hope for this
day at all.''
   Following Bush's announcement, the tone in Congress shifted from
cautious support to apprehension.
   Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler said Monday in Albany, Ga., that
Congress should reconvene after Thanksgiving to debate the issue
and to better define America's goals.
   Moynihan warned Bush against any U.S. attack on Iraq without
Congress' sanction.
   ``He will wreck our military, he will wreck his administration
and he'll spoil a chance to get a collective security system
working,'' Moynihan said of Bush.
   America's Roman Catholic bishops, at the opening session of
their annual fall meeting, also called for strong limitations on
any use of military force.

   The strongest typhoon of the year
slammed the central Philippines with winds up to 150 miles per hour
Tuesday. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage,
relief and rescue officers said.
   At 8 a.m. (7 p.m. Monday EST), Typhoon Mike was centered over
the northern tip of Cebu island, about 320 miles southeast of
Manila, the weather bureau said.
   Senior forecaster Daniel Dimagiba said the wind speed weakened
to 125 mph as the storm passed over Leyte island, just east of
Cebu, at about 2 a.m. The storm was moving west-northwest at 20
mph, Dimagiba said.
   Maximum storm alerts had been raised in five islands in the area
and lower warnings in the southern tip of Luzon island, where
Manila is located, he said.
   Seas were dangerous and Philippine Airlines canceled 54 domestic
flights from Manila and Cebu. International flights were
unaffected.
   Authorities advised residents the Samar and Leyte island coasts
and the northern region of Mindanao to move to higher ground.
   Classes were canceled in most of northern Mindanao and the
central Visayas region.
   The typhoon is the 14th and strongest to hit the Philippines
this year. About 20typhoons hit the country yearly.
   Before striking the Philippines, Mike had left a large path of
destruction on Palau island over the weekend.
   It toppled toppled trees, devastated crops and battered
buildings in Palau over the weekend. Electrical power was among the
services knocked out Saturday when winds up to 172 mph swept
through Palau's northern islands.
   The typhoon caused no known serious injuries, but it dumped
nearly 10 inches of rain in Koror between Saturday afternoon and
Sunday morning. The winds leveled as much as 90 percent of the
major crops of bananas and coconuts.
   A serious health problem could develop in Koror because sewers
were backing up into some homes, an official said.
   Before hitting Palau, the typhoon caused minor damage on Yap, in
the Federated States of Micronesia.

   Opponents of a paid Martin Luther King holiday
for state employees promised Monday they would take out recall
petitions against any lawmakers who try to pass a King holiday
without submitting it to voters.
   Two King Day holiday measures were defeated in last week's
election, and the state's pocketbook is already taking the strain.
Tour groups have canceled reservations for conventions or stays at
hotels in protest, and football authorities have recommended moving
the 1993 Super Bowl to another state.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford said through a spokesman that she
would consider calling a special session of the lame-duck
Legislature if lawmakers assure her they will pass the King holiday
by a two-thirds vote and thereby block any chance at another public
referendum.
   ``That is nothing more or less than the mentality of a banana
republic,'' said Tempe architect Julian Sanders, a leading King Day
opponent. ``The American democratic process is ... we go to the
polls and accept the will of the majority.''
   Other King Day opponents, calling themselves the ``No-No
Committee'' said they were willing to support a Civil Rights Day if
voters got the final say but would oppose any holiday with King's
name attached to it.
   ``Anything short of a vote by the people is immoral and
illegal,'' committee chairman Bob Rose said.
   Arizona law gives voters the right to gather signatures and
demand a referendum on most bills that clear the Legislature. The
Legislature can abridge that right if 20 members of the 30-member
Senate and 40 members of the 60-member House agree that it is an
emergency measure.
   Supporters of the paid holiday have never had two-thirds support
for any of their proposals in the past, but Mofford press secretary
Vada Manager said Monday that Mrs. Mofford believes lame duck
lawmakers who have retired or been defeated might be more willing
to vote for the holiday now, knowing that they no longer face the
wrath of voters.
   Mrs. Mofford also believes that some lawmakers may change their
minds and support the holiday because the economic effects of not
having one are expected to be devastating, Manager added.
   ``There is now a domino effect of lost tourism, lost conventions
and a lost Super Bowl,'' he said. ``We're taking a beating
nationally image-wise.''
   National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said
Wednesday he will recommend that the league's owners move the 1993
Super Bowl from Phoenix because of the King vote. The governor has
estimated that losing the Super Bowl would cost Arizona $200
million in lost revenue. Fiesta Bowl officials met Monday to decide
which schools to invite to the Jan. 1 game at Tempe, Ariz., now
that Virginia and Notre Dame have turned down invitations because
of the state's stance on the civil rights leader.
   Arizona already has an unpaid holiday honoring King, but holiday
supporters have said it is not enough.
   When King Day supporters got their first holiday through the
Legislature, trading in the paid Columbus Day for a paid King Day,
opponents gathered enough signatures to suspend the law until a
vote could be taken this fall.
   Lawmakers then approved a second bill, canceling the first one
and creating a paid King holiday while leaving Columbus Day in
place. Opponents gathered enough signatures to place that bill on
the ballot too.
   The King-for-Columbus swap was defeated 75-25 last week and the
King-and-Columbus bill was defeated about 51-49.
   Sanders and Rose said they and other opponents of the holiday
were motivated by specific disagreements with King, not by racial
prejudice.
   Arizonans ``don't want a holiday in his honor,'' said Rose, who
describes himself as Hispanic.
   ``I oppose a lot of the things that Martin Luther King did, but
not concerning civil rights,'' Rose said. ``He was an immoral
man.''
   Rose and Sanders both cited disclosures that King may have
plagiarized school work and longstanding complaints that FBI files
on King remained under seal.
   New Hampshire and Montana are the only states without any kind
of King holiday. Most other states have a paid holiday, although
some don't celebrate it every year or make it one of several
options from which state workers may choose.

<HEAD>`Shadowlands,' Starring Nigel Hawthorne, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Shadowlands,'' a new play by William
Nicholson, is tasteful but not terribly exciting theater, an
evening of intellectual soap opera saved by some superb acting.
   The expensive-looking British import, which opened over the
weekend at Broadway's Brooks Atkinson Theater, started life as a
television drama in England and later was expanded by Nicholson
into a full-length play. Its broadcast roots show, particularly in
its cuddly, almost cute treatment of Oxford dons, cantankerous yet
ultimately lovable.
   The most appealing of all is C.S. Lewis, the shy, incredibly
decent man who wrote the best-selling ``Chronicles of Narnia'' and
``The Screwtape Letters.''
   ``Shadowlands'' tells the story of the tragic love affair
between Lewis and American poet Joy Davidman, a straightforward,
direct woman who was one of his biggest fans and eventually became
his wife.
   They first meet at her request, and the acquaintance blossoms
into friendship and finally, after she ends an unhappy marriage,
romance. Tragedy, specifically bone cancer, strikes Joy just before
the first act curtain. The rest of the play deals with the couple's
attempt to reconcile their love with her pain.
   One of the play's main themes is exactly that - ``If God loves
us, why does He allow us to suffer so much,'' Lewis asks in the
opening scene which takes the form of a lecture by the famous
author.
   Pain, according to Lewis, ``is God's megaphone to rouse a deaf
world.'' Without suffering, there is no need for God, the man says.
   ``We're like blocks of stone, out of which the sculptor carves
the forms of men. The blows of his chisel, which hurt us so much,
are what makes us perfect,'' he adds.
   Pain pretty much fills Act 2 with Joy courageously battling the
disease before finally succumbing. Her struggle gives Lewis a
chance to practice what he preaches, a difficult assignment he
accomplishes with remarkable, if predictable, grace.
   What validates ``Shadowlands'' are the performances of Nigel
Hawthorne as the good-hearted Lewis and Jane Alexander as Joy, his
late-in-life love. Hawthorne, clothed in rumpled corduroy, is a
teddy bear of a man. His portrait of Lewis neatly juxtaposes the
man's towering intellectual genius and his innate shyness. There's
a joy in watching this retiring, almost life-long bachelor finally
admit that he has found love.
   Alexander has an even harder task, but she manages to bring an
edge to a series of dying and death-bed scenes that could be merely
soggy and sentimental.
   Michael Allison gives a beautifully drawn performance as Warnie,
Lewis' brother. It's a second-fiddle role but Allison plays it as
if he were the leader of the band.
   The opulent scenery, designed by Mark Thompson, is annoyingly
busy - a large translucent screen keeps dropping in front of the
settings so scenes can be changed but you still can see the actors
and stagehands working behind it.
   Director Elijah Moshinsky cranks the long play up slowly. The
most cartoonish episodes, particularly Joy's dismissal by Lewis'
skeptical colleagues, flounder, but by the time Joy dies, the play
has achieved a certain amount of poignancy.
   After her death, Lewis finds solace in his belief in God and the
knowledge that there is something beyond the here and now. ``This
world that seems to us so substantial, is no more than the
shadowlands. Real life has not begun yet,'' he says. And when
Hawthorne says it, you really do believe him.

   The second-ranking leader of the Maoist
Shining Path guerrilla group was sentenced Monday night to 20 years
in prison after an 18-month trial.
   Osman Morote, 44, was sentenced in a special tribunal in Lima
for terrorism, murder and crimes against the public order. He also
was ordered to pay about $4,500 in reparations.
   At the time of his capture in June 1988, Morote was considered
Shining Path's top leader after Abimael Guzman, the group's
founder, who has been in hiding since 1979.
   The special tribunal that sentenced Morote began weighing the
evidence in April 1989 and the prosecution completed its case this
month.
   More than 20,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path began its war against the government in 1980. The
group has a messianic vision to transform Peru into a rural-based
communist society.

   Emperor Akihito formally became Japan's new monarch
in all-day enthronement ceremonies that were marred by dozens of
terrorist attacks, and national TV said Tuesday that police fear
more radical violence is likely.
   The rites on Monday marked the beginning of nearly a month of
festivities surrounding Japan's first coronation in 62 years.
   Akihito performs the most controversial ritual, a communion with
the gods of Shinto, on the night of Nov. 22-23. Government-run
television said police will review security measures before then
because their great mobilization on Monday failed to stop numerous
leftist attacks.
   The only police reaction was to note that Monday's ceremonies
went off without disruption or delay. Just one injury was reported.
   The enthronement celebrations, featuring prayers to the sun
goddess and other rituals dating to ancient times, have drawn
criticism from groups that believe government funding for them is
unconstitutional.
   Many Japanese ignored the ceremonies, taking advantage of the
special enthronement day holiday to take weekend trips and crowd
golf courses and driving ranges.
   One poll suggested nearly half of all Japanese were not
interested in the enthronement.
   Foreign dignitaries traveled from 158 countries for the
ceremony, which U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
called an event of ``great sobriety and dignity.''
   The visitors included Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's
Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu led more than 2,000 guests in three
cheers of ``Banzai!'' the traditional wish for longeviy. Kaifu
said the guests were ``filled with a mood of celebration.''
   For the enthronement, the 56-year-old Akihito wore an imperial
silk kimono in a reddish-brown shade only he is allowed to wear,
and a black crown of ancient design.
   He stood under the octagonal canopy of his black-lacquered
throne, facing a palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying
bows and swords. With him inside the palace's Hall of Pines were 12
princesses and princes.
   Empress Michiko, dressed in an multicolored court gown with her
face painted white, stood motionless at her own throne, at
Akihito's side. Crown Prince Naruhito, dressed in bright orange to
indicate his status as royal heir, stood closest to his father's
throne.
   The emperor solemnly held aloft the proclamation of his
coronation and promised to ``discharge my duties as symbol of the
state and of the unity of the people'' under Japan's postwar
constitution. The constitution changed the imperial role to that of
a national symbol, not sacred sovereign.
   Later, the imperial household gave a banquet for about 350
guests, most of them foreign royalty or government dignitaries. The
menu featured Japanese delicacies.
   Critics say the coronation and its accompanying rites are based
too closely on the traditional religious rituals used for Akihito's
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, who presided during Japan's
plunge into militarism and World War II.
   Ultra-leftist radicals on Monday set fires that damaged several
Shinto shrines, stopped two train lines and launched mortar-style
projectiles at five military bases.
   Radicals were suspected of involvement in a total of at least 35
incidents, the most ever recorded in a single day.
   Police said radicals launched 10 projectiles at the palace. All
of them missed, and one instead crashed into a locker room at a
women's university. One woman was injured while being evacuated
from a train.
   About 37,000 police were mobilized for the ceremonies. Nearly
10,000 officers were on hand for a 30-minute, three-mile motorcade
by the imperial couple. About 117,000 Japanese citizens lined the
route.
   During the motorcade's journey, a string of firecrackers went
off. Genshu Hanayagi, a dancer well-known for her anti-monarchist
views, was arrested in a scuffle that followed. She faced charges
of violating traffic laws.
   Shortly before the motorcade trip began, a 27-year-old man
attempted ritual suicide by slitting his belly with a fruit knife
in front of the palace. The man's motives were not known. He was
admitted to a nearby hospital, but officials refused to comment on
his condition.

<TEXT>
   The warbling police officers on ABC's ``Cop
Rock'' will sing their swan song on Dec. 26, the television network
said Monday.
   Cancellation rumors for the highly touted, but little watched,
series circulated for weeks. Until Monday, ABC had steadfastly
denied it planned to ax the innovative program by ``Hill Street
Blues'' and ``L.A. Law'' creator Steven Bochco.
   ABC issued a brief statement announcing the series' demise.
Entertainment president Robert Iger said Bochco ``delivered a
daring and brilliantly produced series, one all of us at ABC are
proud to be associated with.''
   ABC said it will announce a replacement later.
   The new fall show premiered with a bizarre blend of singing
cops, a mayor on the take, an officer who dispensed with a cop
killer by murdering him and a drug addict who sold her baby for a
fix.
   Bochco called it the most brilliant thing he's ever done.
   ``I'm as proud of this as anything I've ever been involved in,''
Bochco said Monday in a telephone interview. ``It's tough to look
at those kind of ratings and not be surprised when they call and
say `Look, we hate this as much as you do, but move over.'''
   Since its Sept. 26 debut, the series dropped to the bottom third
of A.C. Nielsen Co. rankings.
   Asked why viewers did not like his newest show, Bochco said, ``I
don't know. It ain't medicine. If they don't like it, you can't
force them to watch it.''
   The executive producer, who also has the hit comedy series
``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' on ABC, has a development deal with the
network for eight additional shows, including an animated,
prime-time program for next year called ``Critters.''
   ``I've never felt more supported by a network,'' Bochco said.
``The truth is, I'm not going to go off and pout. I'm not mad at
anybody. We work and live in a very commercial and intensely
competitive world.''
   ``Cop Rock,'' with its live singing and ensemble cast, was an
expensive show to produce. At a news conference a few weeks ago
dominated by questions about ``Cop Rock,'' Iger said there were no
imminent cancellation plans.

   Dutch authorities handed an Air
Force sergeant over to U.S. military authorities Monday after they
promised not to execute him for killing and dismembering his wife.
   Staff Sgt. Charles D. Short, 34, of Highwood, Ill., was
delivered to the 32nd Tactical Air Force Squadron in Soesterberg,
said JusticeMinistry spokesman Victor Holtus. That ended a
two-year battle over which country had the right to try Short.
   In 1988, a Dutch court sentenced him to six years in jail for
slaying his Turkish-born wife, dismembering her and dumping the
remains in plastic bags.
   The Dutch High Court ultimately overturned the sentence, saying
authorities here had no jurisdiction over the U.S. serviceman.
   But in a separate ruling in March, the High Court said Short
could not be surrendered to the United States as long as he could
face the death penalty.
   U.S. military authorities issued a written guarantee that Short
would not be sentenced to death, Justice Ministry officials said.
   The Dutch have no capital punishment and refuse to extradite
anyone who could be executed elsewhere.
   Holtus said it wasn't known where Short would ultimately stand
trial.

<HEAD>Daily News Won't Discuss Distribution System, Strikers Hand Out
`Real News'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News intensified its efforts Monday to
get the tabloid to readers while its striking employees
counterattacked with a publication telling their side of the bitter
dispute.
   The strikers created an 8-page paper called Real News using the
out-of-work staff. The publication looks somewhat like the News and
has columns, stories and analyses about the strike.
   Striking driver Don Robertson said 200,000 copies were
distributed Sunday and 250,000 more would be on the streets by
Tuesday morning.
   The unions planned to keep up their public relations blitz
Tuesday with a breakfast with legislative leaders who support their
strike.
   Meanwhile, the Daily News ran ads over the weekend calling for
people willing to distribute the paper to come to the News Building
on Monday.
   A spokeswoman for the paper would not discuss the distribution
system. She also would not provide circulation figures, which
Publisher James Hoge said last week was at 400,000 daily, compared
to pre-strike levels of 1.09 million.
   Street hawkers, some of them hired from among the homeless, were
seen around Manhattan Monday at sites where the paper has had
trouble distributing during the strike. Many vendors have refused
to sell it, while others claim they have received no deliveries.
   The strike began Oct. 25 after a dispute in which some drivers
walked off the job. The News brought in replacement workers that
night and said that 60 union drivers were out of a job.
   The shutdown spread to other unions, which have said the paper
engaged in unfair labor practices, a charge the News denies. There
are about 2,100 striking union employees.
   The paper has continued to be published by management, members
of the Newspaper Guild who crossed the picket lines and replacement
workers.
   Meanwhile, there were reports of violence and intimidation of
news dealers and union charges that the paper has hired ``goons and
thugs'' to attack them. As of Sunday, the police reported 151
incidents related to the strike, with 74 arrests and four police
officers injured.
   While the News says it has held onto its advertisers, the city's
other two daily tabloids have picked up significant amounts of
advertising since the strike began.

   Rain-swollen rivers receded Monday
but some of the hundreds of people chased from their homes by
flooding last week were warned to wait before returning home. A new
storm was on its way.
   Gov. Booth Gardner proclaimed a state of emergency for Whatcom,
Skagit, Snohomish, King and Grays Harbor counties on Sunday. The
proclamation directs state workers, equipment and money to local
governments to help them cope with the flooding.
   Western Washington was drenched between Thursday and Saturday by
a deluge that poured more than a foot of rain in some mountain
places. The rains, riding on a subtropical storm track dubbed the
``Pineapple Express,'' filled and spilled over rivers with
near-record flood levels.
   On Monday, floodwaters receded after two days of clear skies and
warm temperatures.
   No injuries were reported in the floods, but more than 600
people were forced from their homes. Property damage was expected
to reach tens of millions of dollars.
   Many evacuees were home again by Monday. But residents of Fir
Island on the Skagit River delta, about four miles southwest of
here and 40 miles north of Seattle, were warned to stay away a
little longer, said Dave Brookings, Skagit County assistant flood
control engineer.
   The National Weather Service predicted another inch or two of
rain starting Monday night.
   ``We're saying, before you spend a lot of money going through
cleanup operations and that sort of thing, let's ride out this next
little storm,'' Brookings said.
   Crews were already at work sandbagging along the lower Skagit
and Snohomish rivers Monday and repairing levees, said Mark Stewart
of the state Department of Emergency Management.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American choreographer Vic Upshaw, who brought
modern jazz styles to France in the mid-1960s, has died in Paris of
a long illness, his family announced Monday. He was 50.
   Upshaw died of a serious stomach disorder Nov. 5, according to a
spokeswoman for a dance society he worked with.
   Born in Birmingham, Ala., in 1940, Upshaw played minor roles in
the 1958 film version of ``South Pacific'' and in actress Judy
Garland's version of ``A Star is Born'' before moving to France in
1964.
   Upshaw designed new routines for the Blue Bell Girls at the
famed Lido cabaret. His own dance group, the Vic Upshaw Six, was a
staple for years on French television variety shows.
   He taught steps to some of France's best-known show business
personalities, including Catherine Deneuve, Sylvie Vartan, Pierre
Mondy and Jean-Claude Brialy.
   In recent years, Upshaw had brought French cabaret styles to the
other side of the Atlantic, splitting his time between homes in
Paris, Los Angeles and Hawaii.
   Upshaw was buried last week in Les Batignolles, a suburb of
Paris, his family said. No other details about his illness or his
survivors were disclosed.

   Rebel leader Tin Maung Win said Monday
that his guerrilla organization has asked Burma's largest
pro-democracy party - hard hit by arrests - to form a provisional
government in rebel-held territory.
   Tin Maung Win is general secretary of the Democratic Alliance of
Burma, composed of 22 ethnic minority and dissident groups and the
biggest rebel organization fighting the Rangoon government.
   He spoke on the eve of a meeting between his alliance and
members of the National League for Democracy.
   The League won a big victory in general elections in May but the
ruling military junta refused to relinquish power. Last month the
military arrested four of the League's few remaining Central
Committee members and raided League offices throughout the country.
   The military also moved against dissidents among Buddhist
clergy, raiding monasteries and arresting monks.
   The rebel organization controls about one-third of Burma, mostly
areas bordering Thailand, Bangladesh and China.
   Speaking at the major rebel stronghold of Manerplaw, along the
Thai-Burmese border, Tin Maung Win said of his proposal: ``This
government would only be a temporary one, until the NLD can stand
on its own two feet and declare a legitimate government in
Rangoon.''
   A nationwide pro-democracy movement in Burma was bloodily
crushed by the military in September 1988. Aung San Suu Kyi, a
major figure of that movement and a leader of the League, has been
under house arrest in Rangoon since July 1989.
   Amnesty International, the world human rights organization with
headquarters in London, said last week it had reports of widespread
torture of political detainees in Burma. A team of U.N. human
rights investigators left Burma on Sunday, but diplomats stationed
in Rangoon said its activities here were severely restricted by the
military.
   The alliance chief fear exists that the ruling State Law and
Order Restoration Council would totally outlaw the League, and so
it was being offered ``sanctuary in the liberated zone.''
   ``The NLD cannot function in Rangoon any more, let alone form a
government,'' he told reporters.
   ``The ... (state council) has no intention of transferring power
and continues to suppress any moves toward democracy and so we have
an obligation to the Burmese people to take a definite course of
action.''
   How many League members had fled to rebel-held areas was not
known, but scattered reports said both party members and monks had
fled the cities to avoid arrest.
   A dozen ethnic minority groups long have fought the central
government, demanding more autonomy. Since 1988, students and
others fleeing repression have joined them in the interior.

<TEXT>
   The newest member of the Moscow
Circus is being treated by the rest of the troupe as another symbol
of newfound Soviet freedom.
   Katia Stepanov, born Nov. 3 in Houston, is believed to be the
first child born to members of a Soviet circus touring the United
States.
   She has dual citizenship in the Soviet Union and the United
States and has 18 years to decide which one she prefers.
   ``I am proud my daughter gave birth to her daughter in America -
in a free country. I would like to see my granddaughter grow up in
the country where she was born,'' said grandmother Olaih Abakarov,
who first entered the circus ring at age 5 and is still with the
troupe.
   Katia's mother, high-wire performer Malvina Stepanov, and her
father, Sasha Stepanov, a member of the Chernyefskys' tumblers,
married last year while on tour in Texas.
   Stepanov was back in the ring when the circus performed through
Sunday at The Palace of Auburn Hills, north of Detroit, but his
wife and their daughter will rest before rejoining the troupe.
   The Moscow Circus is a collectively owned circus not under
government control and was allowed to leave the Soviet Union to
tour on its own.
   Mrs. Stepanov's father, Akhmed Abakarov, joked through
interpreter Marina Mirnaya that he might need an interpreter one
day to talk to Katia.
   ``I'm very happy to have a granddaughter born here,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas killed five children
and two policemen Monday when they ambushed a police vehicle,
authorities said.
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, ambushed
the police vehicle on a bridge near the southern town of Algeciras,
according to a police statement.
   The rebels apparently thought the vehicle was carrying
policemen. Instead it was being used to transport boys and girls
who were receiving instruction under a youth auxilary police
program. Four children also were wounded.
   On Saturday, the FARC joined another guerrilla group, the
National Liberation Army, or ELN, in carrying out the biggest rebel
offensive so far this year.
   The army announced Monday that the rebel death toll from the
fighting in two northern Colombian towns had risen to 26 after four
more bodies of guerrillas were found in a common grave.
   Rebels retreating Saturday from the towns of Taraza and Caceres
were carrying several more dead and wounded with them, according to
official statements.
   Nine soldiers and a police officer also died in the battle,
which took place days after the two guerrilla groups offered to
enter peace talks with the government of President Cesar Gaviria.
   A government statement said the attack had convinced it that
such talks were impossible until the rebels demonstrated their
desire for peace through action.
   The FARC and the ELN are the country's oldest and most active
guerrilla groups.
   Another rebel group, the National People's Army, has maintained
a cease-fire while talking peace with the government. Leaders of
the group have said it will disarm in December.

<HEAD>Poland, Germany to Sign Border Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Germany and Poland announced they will
sign a treaty Wednesday affirming their border on the Oder and
Neisse rivers, laying to rest one of the most intractable disputes
of the post-World War II epoch.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki met last Thursday on the banks of the Oder and agreed to
settle the issue quickly, to begin forging friendly ties between
Poland and the newly reunited German state.
   Foreign ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany and
Krzysztof Skubiszewski of Poland are to sign the treaty in a
ceremony still being arranged in Warsaw.
   ``This is a historic event, closing a certain chapter,''
government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska told the state news
agency PAP on Monday. ``Only a border which is finally confirmed
can become a border that unites, not divides.''
   She said that ``as of Wednesday, in planning Polish-German
cooperation, we will look only to the future.''
   In the treaty, Germany abandons claim to 40,000 square miles of
its former territory in East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia that
was added to western Poland after the war - making up for a greater
expanse of land in the east ceded by Poland to the Soviet Union.
   Further details were being kept private until after the treaty
is signed, Wladyslaw Klaczynski, spokesman for the Polish Foreign
Ministry, said.
   The acquired lands make up about one-third of today's Poland,
including such major cities as Wroclaw, Szczecin and Gdansk, which
was the German-speaking free city of Dantzig between the world
wars.
   By insisting the Polish border be moved so deeply into former
German territory, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin compensated for his
own seizure of Polish lands, punished Germany for World War II and
helped bind Poland to Moscow as the ultimate guarantor of its
western frontier.

   Vice President Dan Quayle and Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew of Singapore signed an agreement Tuesday under which U.S.
armed forces will have increased use of military bases in
Singapore.
   ``The agreement will permit the U.S. Air Force to send aircraft
to Singapore several times each year on training deployments of
several weeks each,'' a U.S. Embassy statement said.
   More U.S. Navy vessels will also visit. The statement said the
increase will start in three to six months.
   The agreement was signed four days after the latest round of
talks between U.S. and Philippine officials on the future of major
U.S. military facilities in the Philippines.
   Many Philipine politicians have called for phasing out those six
bases, the lease on which expires Sept. 16, 1991. U.S. officials
say they want a ``residual'' U.S. military presence in the
Philippines in the future.
   State Department officials have stressed that the planned
expanded American use of military bases in Singapore is intended to
complement rather than substitute for the continued use of the
Philippine facilities, which are among the oldest and largest U.S.
bases on foreign soil.
   Singapore is a small island-state about 1,450 miles southwest of
Manila, the Philippine capital.
   The U.S.-Singapore agreement was described as ``concrete
evidence of the determination of the United States to retain a
military presence in Southeast Asia for the foreseeable future,''
the embassy statement said.
   About 95 Navy and Air Force personnel will be assigned to
Singapore on a year-round basis and about 75 additional Air Force
personnel will rotate through Singapore with each training
deployment, the statement said.
   Negotiations on increased American use of military facilities
have been under way for more than a year in Washington and
Singapore.
   Quayle and Lee are in Tokyo for the enthronement of Emperor
Akihito.

Fundamentalists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the nation's largest Baptist
university said Monday he's tired of being monitored and
second-guessed by fundamentalist extremists and he's going to fight
to keep the school independent.
   Control of Baylor University will be the focal topic when the
Baptist General Convention of Texas kicks off Tuesday, said
university President Herbert H. Reynolds.
   ``As I understand the Bible, one day I am going to face the
Lord. I'm not going to meet 13 other people standing around to take
authority. Therefore, I don't need them down here,'' Reynolds said.
   ``For the first time in 12 years, as far as I'm concerned, on
Sept. 21, action was taken to thwart the juggernaut that we have
seen in the Southern Baptist Convention,'' Reynolds said.
   On Sept. 21, Baylor's board of trustees voted 30-7 with one
abstention to revise the school's charter, establishing a new board
of regents to govern the school.
   The new board, which evetually will have 24 members, will be
elected primarily by the board members themselves with a quarter of
the members coming from the board of trustees, which would continue
to be elected by the Baptist General Convention.
   At a news conference Monday, Reynolds said the decision came as
a result of continued friction from overzealous conservatives who
were threatening to take control of Baylor, the nation's largest
and oldest Baptist university.
   ``We did not seek in any way whatsoever to remove ourselves from
the lives of Texas Baptists,'' Reynolds said.
   ``We have been disenchanted and unhappy with those in this
extremist movement and we definitely have sought to distance
ourselves from them,'' Reynolds said. ``We simply came to the point
that we thought the danger was too great that we might lose our
opportunity to exercise the kind of religious freedom that we want
as an institution.''
   A 25-member committee reviewing the relationship between the
Baptist General Convention of Texas and Baylor met for several
hours Monday to assemble a report to the convention.
   ``We're simply trying to get our minds together,'' said Robert
Naylor, chairman of the panel and retired president of the
Southwest Seminary in Fort Worth. ``I think we'll come out of this
beyond our crisis.
   ``Baylor and the Convention of Texas have existed for 100 years
in a bilateral relationship,'' he said. ``Our people support Baylor
through the Baptist General Convention of Texas. The relationship
has been as identical as family.''
   Naylor said the school's action in turning its board of trustees
into a self-perpetuating panel, rather than one which had been
controlled by the convention, was done unilaterally.
   ``And that has created much of the chaos,'' he said. ``We were
not notified and it was in direct contradiction to the constitution
of the Texas Convention, which provides specifically that no agency
of the Convention shall change its charter without the prior
approval of the Convention.
   Naylor said the convention over the past 40 years has given the
school some $78 million. He said many of the endowments given to
the school were made under the belief that the convention would
continue to control the school.
   Reynolds said the school was not going to be bullied over
funding to rescind the charter change.
   ``There's about $6 million a year we have been getting from the
Texas Baptists, which is about 5 percent of the money we've been
getting from all sources,'' Reynolds said.
   ``We have been extremely grateful to the Texas Baptist for this
money. But we will not subject ourselves to the kind of focus that
exists today just to save the money,'' he said.

   The threat of chemical warfare in the
Persian Gulf presents special problems for the doctors and nurses
assigned to treat those casualties, surgeons general of the Army,
Air Force and Navy said Monday.
   One concern is the contamination of the medical personnel
treating the wounded soldiers, the military doctors said in an
interview at a meeting of the Association of Military Surgeons of
the United States.
   ``Anytime you treat a patient who is contaminated, more people
run the risk of being exposed,'' said Lt. Gen. Monte B. Miller, the
Air Force surgeon general.
   Miller said medical personnel who will be in the field in the
Persian Gulf are trained to work wearing the same protective
equipment as soldiers in danger of exposure to chemical or
biological weapons.
   Also addressing the convention were Lt. Gen. Frank Ledford Jr.,
the Army surgeon general, and Vice Admiral James A. Zimble, the
Navy surgeon general.
   Military doctors and nurses have trained for the likelihood that
the Iraqis will use germ warfare against Operation Desert Shield
troops, the doctors said.
   ``It isn't something we haven't trained to defend against,''
Miller said. ``It does added a frightening dimension, but we feel
like we are well-prepared to handle it.''
   He refused to provide many details, but said troops have
chemical protective suits and instant injection kits with drugs
that block or reverse the effects of nerve gas.
   For all the dangers faced by the U.S. troops military deployed
in the Persian Gulf, maladies like malaria and scorpion stings have
not taken the toll feared, the doctors said.

   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Military food tastes a lot better with
hot sauce, a soldier told his mother in a call home to thank her
for the care package she'd sent.
   Taking a cue from Army Pfc. Adam Rochelle, the Persian Gulf
Support Group began including several bottles of the Mexican-style
sauce in every Christmas box, Rebecca Rochelle said.
   ``He told me, `Mom, that picante sauce makes those (rations)
taste so much better,'' said Mrs. Rochelle. ``They must be dousing
everything with picante sauce.''
   Twenty packages for soldiers who are miles from major cities
were assembled Sunday by members of the support group for Mideast
troops who have families in Dallas and Tarrant counties, and more
shipments were planned.
   ``We really want them (the packages) to go to the front-line
troops because they don't receive gift boxes unless it is
specifically addressed to them,'' said Mrs. Tinker, whose son Grady
left with the 82nd Airborne Division for Saudi Arabia.
   ---&equals;
   HINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) - Amanda Figueroa's contractions were 12
minutes apart, but she didn't want to miss sending a voice-card
recording to her husband, who is stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   ``Hurry home, honey, I'm in labor,'' she said in the message
recorded Friday at Fort Stewart Army Base at Hinesville.
   On Sunday, with newborn son, Pedro Angel Figueroa Jr., at her
side, she recorded another message to let her husband know they
were doing fine at Winn Army Community Hospital.
   Nearly 3,000 people stood in line at Fort Stewart Saturday to
record brief holiday messages to family members who are in the
Gulf.
   Some 80,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in the Middle East during
the holidays will have the opportunity to hear personal voice
messages from family and friends back home. The voice-chip greeting
cards are being provided by Marlboro at no charge.

   SHERWOOD, Ark. (AP) - Some military wives have created a support
group called Wives Against Saddam Hussein, or WASH, while they
await word of their husbands in the Persian Gulf.
   WASH consists of women whose husbands are Army reservists from
the 321st Material Management Center at El Dorado. The unit
specializes in tracking troop supplies. It was deployed to the gulf
Oct. 7 and is expected to remain at least six months.
   ``It's really amazing the closeness that you feel with each
other during this situation,'' said Sharon Burnett, who organized
WASH. Her husband, Lt. Col. John Burnett, is the commander of the
321st, which includes 200 reservists from Arkansas, eastern Texas
and northern Louisiana.
   WASH meets every two weeks at different locations. About 30
wives attended the most recent meeting at a Camden church, Mrs.
Burnett said.
   The women share the latest news from their husbands and try to
``put the bits and pieces together,'' she said. A potluck meal
follows.

   Claire Tannenbaum's hand-painted yarmulkes
are a big hit with many Jewish youngsters. Some even sport Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles and sports emblems on their skullcaps.
   Ms. Tannenbaum, a retired bookeeper from Tamarac, personalizes
the yarmulkes using acrylic paint and glitter. They sell for $18 in
the gift shop of Temple Beth Am's gift shop in Margate, and are
being offered in catalogs and many Judaica stores.
   ``Nobody's asked for Dick Tracy, but somebody did ask for a Bart
Simpson,'' she said. ``If you give them something they're
interested in, they'll wear it.''
   Jewish males wear skullcaps for worship and prayer although they
can also be worn outside the synagogue. The typical yarmulke is
made of unadorned white or black fabric.
   Yarmulkes with designs and depictions have grown in popularity
in the past five years, said Temple Beth Am's rabbi, Paul Plotkin.
   Plotkin's son wears one, while the temple's youth director often
dons a Ninja Turtle cap or another inscribed with ``Just Do It.''
   ``I'm a big FSU fan,'' said 15-year-old Matt Sandak of Coral
Springs, whose yarmulke sports a Florida State University Seminole.
``One of my friends has the Chicago Bulls. (These yarmulkes) are a
lot better than the plain ones.''
   Ms. Tannenbaum, who began dabbling in yarmulke art almost three
years ago, initially put the Hebrew alphabet on the caps. Holiday
symbols, dancing children and biblical themes soon followed.
   Now the artwork includes everything from Batman to the Miami
Dolphins.
   ``It's like designer jeans,'' Ms. Tannenbaum said. ``When one
person has it, everyone else wants one.''

<HEAD>CNN To Appeal Noriega Tapes Order to Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a
ban on broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's telephone
conversations with his legal team.
   Constitutional law experts said it could become a landmark case.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said Nov. 11 that the appeal was
being prepared, but he didn't know when it would be filed.
   CNN had defied an order Nov. 9 by U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler of Miami by broadcasting an excerpt in which the deposed
Panamanian dictator spoke in Spanish with a secretary for defense
lawyer Frank Rubino.
   CNN decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the
excerpt early Nov. 10, Haworth said. Later that day, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's ruling.
   The appeals court also told CNN to give the seven tapes to the
Miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would
endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the invasion of Panama in December.
   Rubino asked Hoeveler to find CNN in direct civil contempt and
fine the network $300,000 for each time it televised the tapes and
each time it showed them in the future.
   CNN accused Hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself
from the case.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer who served as
co-counsel for The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, said
the CNN case could set precedent because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
   ``We've almost totally banned prior restraint,'' Abrams said.
``If the Supreme Court were to uphold the prior-restraint order on
CNN, this would be the first time in our country's history that any
such court order had been affirmed by the court.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S. Supreme Court said
the government could not bar publication of classified documents
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather than
defy a lower court order.
   George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute of Media
Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., called the CNN case ``an
astonishing illustration of censorship,'' but said the network was
``playing with blasting caps'' by defying the judge's order.
   ``It's rare in general that a news organization of any kind -
broadcast, cable or print - would do such a thing,'' said Rahdert,
who represents several newspapers. ``It really falls into the
category of civil disobedience.''
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the case is a classic
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover.
   He said the district court and appeals court construed the case
as a conflict between the Sixth Amendment, which provides a
defendant a right to a fair trial, and the First Amendment, which
provides for freedom of the press.
   ``There's a more fundamental issue here: reporting the news of
possible governmental misconduct,'' Johnson said. ``If CNN can be
restrained from airing news about the Noriega tapes, so can any
news organization.''
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said U.S. officials wanted
to find out how the tapes were leaked to CNN.
   ``It concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was
made of these tapes,'' he said.
   Hoeveler said he had to weigh Noriega's right to a fair trial
against CNN's right to freedom of the press.
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' he said.
   CNN's broadcast marked the first time the tapes themselves had
been made public, but not the first time their contents were
reported.
   New York Newsday published a story last month based on summaries
of the tapes in which unidentified federal sources said it appeared
the former Panamanian leader was attempting to organize resistance
to the U.S.-supported government of President Guillermo Endara,
which replaced his regime.

<HEAD>Newspapers Ask Appeals Court To Publish Restraint Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rock Hill Herald and The Charlotte
(N.C.) Observer want an appeals court to publish its opinion
overruling a federal judge's prior-restraint order so it can serve
as a legal precedent.
   ``The opinion in this case, if published, will provide
substantial guidance to lower courts in this circuit, in the event
they are requested, or otherwise inclined, to prohibit the news
media from publishing information properly obtained during open
court proceedings,'' papers filed by the newspapers' lawyers said.
   If the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does publish its
opinion, it would mean the case could be cited as a precedent in
future prior-restraint cases, said David Robinson II, a lawyer for
The Herald.
   ``There's nothing published of recent vintage that deals with
open court statements and prior restraint,'' Robinson said Nov. 9.
``We think this would be helpful in the future.''
   Unpublished opinions made by the appeals court cannot be cited
in legal proceedings, Robinson said.
   The case began Oct. 31 when U.S. District Judge Charles E.
Simons Jr. inadvertently said in open court in Columbia, S.C., that
Rock Hill attorney Mitchell K. Byrd was a ``target'' of a drug
investigation.
   When Simons was told that reporters from The Herald and the
Observer were in the courtroom, he ordered them not to print his
remark.
   Both newspapers appealed the order and neither printed the name
the following morning.
   The Herald printed the judge's statement about Byrd on Nov. 2
and was later called to court to defend that action.
   On Nov. 6, the appeals court declared the judge's original order
invalid, and Simons dropped his case against The Herald and
canceled the ordered court appearance.
   John Buchan, a lawyer for the Observer, said federal trial
judges are bound by precedents in their circuits and therefore
would be required to follow this order, if published.
   ``Having such a precedent will resolve such issues before they
reach the appellate court, because the laws will be very clear,''
Buchan said.

<HEAD>Daily News Unions Say They're Willing To Accept Pay Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Daily News workers are ready to take
the same pay cuts that their colleagues at the New York Post
accepted two months ago, the newspaper unions' leader said.
   George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, made the comment Nov. 8 after News Publisher James Hoge
said union negotiators had offered only small concessions during
the 10 months of negotiations that preceded the strike.
   McDonald, head of the 10-union coalition of workers at both the
News and the Post, responded, ``Go back and say to Hoge that
McDonald said at a press conference: `We'll match what we gave the
Post.'''
   News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson said McDonald ``should learn that
the place for negotiations is at the bargaining table, not at a
news conference.''
   In September, nine of the 10 unions agreed to nearly $20 million
in wage cuts at the Post after owner Peter Kalikow said the only
alternative was to close the paper. Many employees agreed to a 20
percent pay cut by switching to a four-day work week.
   The News' executives say that they are trying to regain lost
management control and that the main issues are union overstaffing,
featherbedding and other labor abuses that continue to escalate
operating costs.
   The News, meanwhile, stepped up efforts to create a network of
people across the city to sell the newspaper despite an aggressive
boycott campaign by striking workers.
   The paper ran a full-page ad Nov. 11 saying it had ``immediate
needs for individuals who want to own, operate, and direct their
own work force selling newspapers.'' The ad said in large letters:
``UNLIMITED INCOME.''
   The poor and homeless have been recruited by the News as sales
people. One recruit, Eddy Nadreau, said the News had called the
Brooklyn shelter where he lives, offering $6 an hour and a
percentage of sales.
   Strikers fanned out over the city Nov. 12 to start distributing
what union officials said were a million copies of an eight-page,
free newspaper titled ``Real News.''
   All the stories in ``Real News'' were written by writers who
have been on strike since Oct. 25. The paper is aimed at giving the
strikers' version of the labor dispute.
   The News has published each day during the strike, but
circulation has been a major problem. Some vendors have refused to
sell it and others claim they get no deliveries. Some vendors say
they have been threatened by striking drivers.
   Hoge said last week that 600,000 papers were printed each day.
Pre-strike circulation was about 1.09 million copies daily, making
the News the nation's third-largest metropolitan daily.
   Strikers, in turn, have reported violence by security forces
hired by the News.
   The chairman of the state Assembly's labor committee said Nov. 9
that he would conduct hearings into the allegations of violence.
Assemblyman Frank Barbaro centered his remarks on reports of
violence against strikers and did not mention the allegations of
threats against vendors or the damage done to trucks and other
Daily News property.
   A group of clergymen went to the News Building on Nov. 7 to urge
the paper to return to negotiations with the strikers and to
express concern over the economic and social damage of the strike.
   Speaking for a clerical ``Coalition of Conscience,'' the Rev.
James A. Forbes Jr., senior minister of Riverside Church, said the
tactic of hiring permanent replacements for striking employees
``seriously undercuts management's claim to be bargaining in good
faith.''
   The News' spokeswoman said: ``This company is not anti-union. We
have negotiated for the better part of this year and continue to be
open to the bargaining process.''
   Earlier in the week, the National Association of Black
Journalists canceled an agreement to sell its membership list to
the News after being pressured by the striking unions. The News
wanted to use the list to contact potential replacement workers.
   ``There was a perception that this was seen as furthering
management's position. That was never our intention,'' said Thomas
Morgan, president of the association. ``We still feel our members
have the right to make up their minds about this issue.''
   The News also sought to buy membership lists from the National
Association of Hispanic Journalists and the Asian-American
Journalists Association, but those two groups said they refused.
   A star Daily News columnist, Mike McAlary, bolted to the rival
New York Post on Nov. 10. He said he decided to go ``because of the
way the Daily News treated their employees.''
   The strike began Oct. 25 with a dispute at the paper's Brooklyn
plant. Some deliverers walked off the job; the News responded by
bringing in replacement workers.
   The walkout spread to eight of nine other unions at the paper.
The unions, representing 2,100 workers, had been working without
contracts since March 30.
   Labor leaders have charged that the News' owner, the Tribune
Co., provoked the strike to try to break the unions or, failing
that, close the paper.
   Charles Brumback, president and chief executive officer of
Tribune, denied the parent company is calling the shots in the
News' handling of the strike.
   ``This is a New York situation and it will be solved by the
Daily News management in New York,'' he said.

<HEAD>Murdoch Decries New York Violence and Newspaper Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch says he's horrified by the rising
violence in New York and he partly blames what he calls the
shortcomings of the city's union-controlled newspapers.
   Murdoch said the New York newspaper unions, currently on strike
against the Daily News, have been the ``world's worst'' since his
company broke the British unions in a bitter labor struggle in the
mid-1980s.
   Calling crime in New York ``quite simply horrible'' and
``unprecedented,'' Murdoch said in a speech Nov. 8 that the city's
press was to some extent responsible because ``the media's
inhibitions about reporting the crime wave resulted in a sort of
false consciousness among the public.''
   Murdoch, who has a penthouse overlooking Manhattan's Central
Park, owned the New York Post from 1976 to 1988 and still owns
WNYW-TV, a local Fox channel.
   When Murdoch ran the Post he was regularly denounced for what
critics called overly sensational coverage of brutal crimes that
appealed to the public's ``base passion.''
   ``I don't agree that I took it too far downmarket,'' Murdoch
said. ``I think I didn't take it downmarket far enough.''
   Regarding the city's powerful newspaper unions, Murdoch called
them one of the obstacles to better newspaper operations and
journalism in the city.
   ``As you will know, in 1986 I took on the printing unions in
Britain, the world's worst, and broke them,'' he said. ``The result
has been a silver age for British journalism: newly prosperous
papers and wholly new papers.''
   With the demise of those unions, he said, ``the New York City
unions have succeeded to the distinction of being the world's
worst.''

<HEAD>UPI Says It Will Liquidate If Union Rejects Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 83-year-old news service United Press
International will be liquidated Nov. 16 if members of the Wire
Service Guild reject a 90-day pay cut of 35 percent as the union's
leaders are recommending, UPI says.
   ``At this point we see no real alternative if the vote is
against the proposal,'' UPI spokesman Milt Capps said.
   Pieter VanBennekom, UPI executive vice president, told employees
that without approval of the pay cut, ``we cannot ensure that we
will have enough cash on hand to meet the payroll and other
life-or-death obligations for the next two weeks. Therefore, we
will have to take the once-unthinkable step of putting UPI into
liquidation.''
   Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of the guild, said from the
union's headquarters in New York: ``There is little doubt in our
minds that the company needs a lot of money and it needs a lot of
money fast. We are simply saying that they are coming to the wrong
people to get that kind of money.''
   He said officers of the union were sticking to their
recommendation that the contract be rejected, but would submit it
to the full membership for a vote.
   UPI, which has changed ownership three times in eight years,
announced Nov. 2 that it had cut management salaries by 35 percent
for 90 days and would seek similar concessions from employees
represented by the guild as it seeks a buyer.
   UPI announced in September that it would close bureaus in five
states and said Oct. 12 it was dismissing an unspecified number of
employees. The company said more employees were laid off Nov. 6 but
declined to say how many.
   VanBennekom said several companies had expressed interest in the
news service, which is owned by Infotechnology Inc. along with an
interest in Financial News Network.
   The new heads of Infotechnology said Nov. 7 that they would
recommend selling all the company's principal operations.
   Alan J. Hirschfield and Allan R. Tessler, appointed co-chief
executives in a management shakeup Oct. 24, said they had retained
the investment banking firm Wertheim Schroder and Co. to seek
buyers.

<HEAD>The National Dropping Sunday Edition; Price Relinquishes Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National will drop its Sunday issue next
month and the publisher of the 9-month-old sports daily has been
relieved of day-to-day duties.
   Steve Hammond, a spokesman for the paper, said Nov. 12 that
Peter Price would continue to hold the titles of president and
publisher but would be involved with broader issues such as
entering new markets.
   Hammond said Jaime Davila had been brought in to assume Price's
operating responsibilities. Davila is a top executive at Univisa
Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Mexico's Televisa entertainment and
publishing concern headed by Emilio Azcarraga, the media baron who
is The National's biggest shareholder.
   Hammond also said Diane Morgenthaler, circulation director;
Timothy Lasker, assistant publisher; and Daniel W. Correa, finance
and administration director, had been dismissed. He said none had
yet been replaced but declined to elaborate.
   Price was unavailable for comment.
   The development came three days after Editor in Chief Frank
Deford said The National would end the Sunday edition and publish
five rather than six days a week.
   He said there might be ``a handful'' of jobs cut but that he
hoped the number could be absorbed through attrition to avoid
layoffs.
   ``There is a feeling that as in practically every other business
in America we should tighten our belts,'' Deford saidin a
telephone interview.
   He denied the newspaper was in serious financial trouble as it
tries to become the first national sports daily in America. ``It's
just a matter of belt-tightening,'' he repeated.
   A day earlier, a source familiar with the newspaper who spoke on
condition of anonymity said the Sunday issue was being discontinued
because circulation on Sundays had amounted to only about 80
percent of that on weekdays and it had proven harder to distribute
the paper on Sundays than on weekdays.
   The National has been published six days a week, Sunday through
Friday, since it was launched Jan. 31.
   Deford said the last Sunday issue would be published Nov. 25.
   The newspaper is owned by a partnership led by Mexican media
baron Emilio Azcarraga.
   The paper started with distribution in three markets - New York,
Chicago and Los Angeles. Additional editions have been added in San
Diego, San Francisco, Dallas, Detroit, Boston and Miami and the
paper has announced plans to begin a 10th edition in the
Baltimore-Washington area in early December.

   The San Fernando Valley-based daily employs about 1,200 people.
Four percent of the work force is 48 employees.
   As part of the restructuring, the Daily News has offered a

<HEAD>Oakland Tribune Seeks 20 Percent Cut in Employment Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oakland Tribune wants to reduce
employment costs by 20 percent as part of a plan to restore the
newspaper's financial health.
   The newspaper said in a statement Nov. 9 that the decrease would
be gained ``through a combination of wage and benefit reductions
among the company's 600-plus employees.''
   The Tribune began presenting the proposal to labor negotiators
for 11 bargaining units whose contracts expire on Dec. 31 and to
other affected employees.
   The plan will not affect any workers who earn less than $25,000
a year or earn less than $13 an hour, the statement said.
   ``The newspaper advertising market is in a national downturn,''
said Robert Maynard, editor and publisher. ``It's now even more
critical that we accelerate our plan swiftly and successfully in
order to remain competitive.''
   The proposal is the second part of a restructuring plan. The
first phase, which was announced in June, involved a reduction in
force, streamlining management and operational changes.

<HEAD>Panamanian Journalists Protest Press Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 journalists marched
silently down the city's main street Nov. 8 and picketed the
presidential palace to protest press laws carried over from the
deposed regime of Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   President Guillermo Endara, who sued a newspaper columnist
earlier in the week, met the journalists outside the palace and
angrily defended a law under which slander is heavily penalized.
   ``The president of the republic is a person and is going to
demand reponsibility when there is an attempt to damage his
honor,'' Endara said. ``That is what I will do in each and every
one of the cases, and there is no persecution.''
   Then he turned his back and refused to accept a protest letter
the journalists had signed.
   The next day, Endara told reporters he was shocked by the
behavior of the journalists in the march. ``... The things they
shouted at me were really outrageous.''
   He said he refused to receive the marchers in his office because
``they wanted to enter just because they were reporters, as if they
were the sacred cows of this republic, and they aren't.''
   Endara, installed after the American invasion that overthrew
Noriega, filed a slander and damage complaint against Dagoberto
Franco of the daily El Siglo. Franco was detained for two days and
released on $5,000 bond.
   Franco had written a column titled ``Endara: The Great
Swindle.''
   At least 60 formal complaints have been filed against
journalists this year, mostly by government officials, the
protesters said.
   Journalists are asking that slander be changed from a criminal
to a civil violation. The current penalty is two to five years in
jail.
   In their letter, the journalists said, ``We are here because 21
years of castrated journalism has left us a bitter taste of exiles,
threats, pressures and fears that we never want to repeat.''
   Panama's constitution provides for freedom of expression but
says there are ``legal responsibilities when by any of these media
one attacks the reputation or honor of the persons in violation of
the social security or public order.''

   The 16-page compendium of news and opinion will go on sale Nov.
14 aimed primarily at the 650,000-strong Jewish community of

   Levy said about 85 percent of the new paper's content would be

original material of interest to French-speaking Jews abroad.
   The English-language international edition sells 60,000 copies a

<HEAD>Philippine Radio Program Airs Real-Life Drama: Overseas Calls</HEAD>

   Lita Belga had not heard from her
husband for months. When she learned he died in a car accident in
Saudi Arabia, she wept. Millions of other Filipinos wept, too.
   Mrs. Belga received news of her husband Benjamin's death during
a telephone call to his Saudi employers - paid for and broadcast by
private radio station DZRH.
   The program, called ``Around The World, With Love,'' features
telephone conversations between Filipinos and their relatives
working abroad. The calls are free - on condition they can be used
on the show.
   The highly popular broadcast has become a real-life soap opera,
a daily litany of money troubles, loneliness, death and other
family crises.
   ``The beauty of the program is the spontaneity of it,'' said the
program's host, Rey Langit. ``It is true-to-life drama unfolding
right before you. It is both entertaining and educational.''
   There is no shortage of people wanting to use the program to
contact relatives overseas, even though the price is having
personal conversations broadcast nationwide.
   Most callers are too poor to afford overseas telephone calls.
All but emergency cases wind up on a waiting list, with a backlog
that now runs about two months.
   Langit says the station makes little profit from the program
because calls are expensive. He places an average of six calls
during the two-hour program, which is broadcast six days a week.

It also included satellite hook-ups in which people questioned Vice

<HEAD>CBS Stock Moves on Speculation About Sale of Paley's Holdings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. shares fluctuated after a report that
executors of William S. Paley's estate might decide to sell the
late CBS chairman's 8 percent stake in the media company.
   But CBS executives and media analysts said even if the stock
were sold, chances were slim it could lead to an unfriendly bid for
control of the company, a frequent subject of takeover rumors.
   Laurence A. Tisch, CBS's president and chief executive, controls
Loews Corp. and its 24.9 percent stake in CBS. That stake, combined
with stock held by employees and investors who support Tisch
effectively blocks any unwelcome bids for control of the company,
media analysts say.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Nov. 7 that a sale of the stock
seemed likely, partly because the Paley estate, valued at about
$500 million, must raise $190 million to cover tax obligations.
   Pat Gallagher, executive director of the William S. Paley
Foundation and one of six executors of the estate, said he could
not confirm the tax liability figure but called suggestions the
stock might be sold ``pure speculation.''
   Gallagher noted the estate includes other securities and
investments, including artwork and real estate, that could be used
to satisfy tax obligations.
   Paley, longtime chairman of CBS, died last month. Much of his
estate, including 1.9 million shares of CBS stock valued at nearly
$300 million, is to be divided among his six children.

as a regular correspondent at the end of the season but will stay

   ``It's been a nice ride, but you can't go on forever,'' the
67-year-old Reasoner said Nov. 8.
   He joined CBS in 1956 and went to work at ``60 Minutes'' when it
began in 1968. He left the network in 1970 to anchor the ``ABC
Evening News,'' at one point co-anchoring that show - unhappily -

   Next season, he will be an ``editor emeritus'' of the CBS show

six a year, compared with 20 he now does annually.
   No one will succeed Reasoner, said a spokeswoman for the show,

   At 72, Mike Wallace is the show's senior citizen. Several months

   ``I suddenly realized I'd been working 53 years, about half of

<HEAD>NBC Denies Union's Allegations of Age Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A broadcast union at odds with NBC claims NBC
News is trying to get rid of some older staffers by putting them in
a common labor pool described as ``professional exile.''
   The network denied it.
   ``These people all have jobs and they're not going away,'' Don
Browne, NBC's executive news director, said of about 35 NBC News
writers and producers who will be taken from specific programs and
put in the pool for use as needed.
   The move was done as a cost-cutting measure, with the executive
producers of shows like ``Today'' and ``NBC Nightly News'' deciding
which members of their staff would be shifted to the labor pool.
   John Clark, president of the New York local of the National
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, said Nov. 8
that 12 of 21 NABET members affected are age 50 or over, and ``we
think these are people the company would like to get rid of.''
   He characterized the pool as ``professional exile'' for those
sent there.
   Browne denied that and other allegations by Clark, including his
claim that NBC is apparently retaliating against NABET members who
sued the network for overtime pay by also putting them in the labor
pool.
   Browne said pool members would be put on duty with programs or
work in NBC News bureaus as requirements dictated. ``These people
are going to be very active,'' he said.
   Clark, whose 900-member local is NABET's largest, said the union
will add a claim of age discrimination to a unfair labor practices
complaint it has filed against NBC with the National Labor
Relations Board.
   No action has been taken yet on the complaint, which was filed
after NBC in August put into effect a new three-year contract that
a majority of the union's 2,300 members at NBC previously had
rejected.
   Three years ago, NABET struck NBC in a bitter walkout that
lasted 17 weeks. No strike vote has been called this time, so far,
although no new negotiations are planned, Clark said.

   Pro wrestler Andre the Giant was fined
$100 Nov. 6 for doing to a TV cameraman what he does to opponents
in the ring.
   A judge found Andre Roussimoff guilty of criminal mischief for
scuffling with Ben Hildebrandt last year after losing a match. The
7-foot-4 wrestler also was ordered to pay $233 to KCRG-TV for

   Comedian Bill Cosby says he's been the victim of a media
vendetta in coverage of a dispute over a student-painted mural that
was dropped from the opening credits of his NBC show. ``I'm very,
very upset and I'm not going to take this kind of treatment.
Celebrities are very, very easy to take a shot at,'' Cosby said in
an interview with ``A Current Affair.'' ``In the media,'' he said,
``they talk to 12 people and all they need to do is find one out of
12 to say, `Well, I think he's not such a great person,' and that's
the interview that shows up in the paper.'' ...
   Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, talked to Australian
schoolchildren Nov. 7 about the media attention she attracts. ``You
always have to remember that they're there watching,'' she said in
a radio interview conducted by pupils. ``If you trip up down the
steps, they'll criticize you for tripping down the steps, so you
have to be careful.'' ...
   He may have terrorized Mr. Wilson for four decades, but

in his illustrated autobiography, ``The Merchant of Dennis the
Menace,'' that the strip's characters have been in Wichita since
the strip began in the 1950s. ``I had no idea he lived here, but he
sure is welcome,'' Mayor Bob Knight said.

   ``It looks like many people will be marching in next year's

2nd Lt. Benjamin Lacy, 23, of Largo, Fla., said at the Mideast post

   TOKYO (AP) - Emperor Akihito ascended to the world's oldest
hereditary monarchy today, the first in a legendary 2,600-year-old
line of emperors to be enthroned as a national symbol rather than a
living god.
   Leftist extremists, who consider the institution of emperor an
unconstitutional relic of Japan's militarist past, attacked
military bases, train stations and Shinto shrines in protest.
   Police counted at least 34 guerrilla attacks timed to coincide
with the coronation of the late Emperor Hirohito's 56-year-old son.
None appeared to cause any injuries.
   A record 37,000 police had been mobilized to guard the
ceremonies as well as the attending dignitaries from 158 countries,
including Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles
and Princess Diana.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Savings and loan executives attending their
98th annual convention are confronting a crucial question: Whether
their institutions should hang together as S&amp;Ls or survive
separately as banks.
   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions' position on the issue
marks a change in its thinking. One of its lobbying goals for
thrift bailout legislation enacted last year was to preserve the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board as an independent regulator of S&amp;Ls.
   But it lost on that point. Congress dismantled the bank board,
putting most of its functions into a Treasury Department bureau,
the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Now, there is a growing movement to abolish the thrift office
and let the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a Treasury
bureau that oversees banks, regulate S&amp;Ls as well.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Workers may well respond to pay cuts by stealing
company property, eroding at least part of the cost savings their
bosses sought, a new study says.
   Employee thefts more than doubled at a manufacturing plant when
a 15 percent pay cut was imposed, and fell back to normal when full
wages were restored, the study found.
   An identical pay cut at a comparable plant caused less of an
increase in pilfering because management explained its reasons
fully and sensitively, researcher Jerald Greenberg said.
   ``You can make people less likely to hurt the company by ...
explaining to them in a socially sensitive manner, and a highly
informative manner, why it was necessary for them to suffer this
inequity,'' said Greenberg, a professor of management and human
resources at Ohio State University.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) - Stormie Jones' painful journey, which ended

   ``We've been able to provide better quality of life and longer
life for many people'' because of Stormie's ordeal, Dr. Jorge
Reyes, staff physician at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said
after Stormie died there Sunday.
   But Stormie didn't like being under a media spotlight,
acquaintances recalled.
   ``She wished everybody would treat her normal instead of like
she had an operation, because she didn't like everybody asking her
how she felt or if she was feeling OK,'' said Crystal Millikan,
Stormie's best friend in her hometown of White Settlement, Texas, a
Fort Worth suburb.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The next time the nation picks a president,
the ``big enchilada'' of politics - California - will be even
bigger.
   Florida and Texas are gaining more stature too, as U.S. House
seats shift to the Sun Belt and bring with them more of the
electoral votes that decide who wins the White House.
   The seats will shift when new congressional districts are drawn
next year to reflect the population shifts detected in the 1990
Census.
   In 1992, California, Florida and Texas will carry a combined 111
electoral votes - 14 more than they did in 1988. That's 41 percent
of the 270 needed to win the presidency.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - On the heels of the lowest election turnout in
50 years comes a study that says it's wrong to blame voter
alienation. Make the process easier, says the report, and more
Americans will cast ballots.
   ``Election procedures in the United States make voting
cumbersome,'' the General Accounting Office tells Congress.
   Its remedies: Set registration deadlines to fall on or close to
Election Day; establish toll-free numbers for absentee ballot
requests; allow voting by mail.
   Last Tuesday's turnout is estimated to have matched that of
1986, which was the lowest in nearly half a century.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Ronald Reagan has always said he's a sucker
for heroes. One of the heroes who influenced him the most, he says,
is Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   Reagan, who often made much of his admiration for the
conservative Calvin Coolidge, has much more to say of the
trailblazing Roosevelt in his new autobiography, ``An American
Life.''
   The 40th president, often pictured as an opponent of the kind of
active government that the 32nd president brought to Washington,
argues that he was really aiming at Lyndon Johnson, not FDR.
   He quotes Roosevelt in support of his free trade views, says he
borrowed Roosevelt's idea of ``fireside chats'' to the people, and
agrees with him on the need for compromise in dealing with
legislators.
   ---&equals;
   TOKYO (AP) - Like her American cousin Bart Simpson, the popular
Japanese cartoon character Chibi Marukochan is out to prove it's OK
to be an underachiever.
   Her relentless mediocrity has won over a nation obsessed with
overachieving, making Chibi an unlikely idol and the year's hottest
fad.
   The lazy third-grader of slurred speech and bob-cut hair even
looks a bit like Bart. Both are drawn two-dimensionally, with a
minimum of detail and unsure lines.
   Chibi's self-proclaimed ambition is to get away with doing the
minimum, but her market performance has been phenomenal.

   Members of Congress voiced rising worry Monday
over President Bush's latest moves in the Persian Gulf, warning
that he is stepping out ahead of his carefully created
international consensus and that Americans as well as allies may
balk at going to war.
   ``If George Bush wants his presidency to die in the Arabian
desert, he's going to get his wish,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an
interview.
   Bush's spokesman quickly retorted, ``Not a shot's been fired.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve, responding to increasing
signs of a recession, soon will cut interest rates in a move that
should prompt banks to lower a variety of consumer and business
rates, many private economists predicted Monday.
   The Fed's credit easing is likely to spur a one-half percentage
point cut in the prime lending rate, and home mortgage rates should
decline modestly as well, many analysts said.
   Any reduction in the prime rate, which has been stuck at 10
percent since January, would be seen as a boost to economic
activity because about one-third of all consumer and business loans
are tied to changes in the prime.
   The Fed's top policy-making body, the Federal Open Market
Committee, will meet behind closed doors Tuesday to map interest
rate strategy.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A conservative challenge to the Senate's No. 3
Republican lends an element of uncertainty to Democratic and GOP
caucuses that will return higher-ranking leaders to their posts on
Tuesday.
   Sen. Thad Cochran will try to wrest the chairmanship of the
Senate Republican Conference from Sen. John Chafee when the GOP
holds its organizational meeting.
   Chafee, who for the past six years has held the third-ranking
Senate Republican post under Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and
Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming, has angered conservatives with a
moderate to liberal voting record, said Bob Billings, executive
director of the American Conservative Union.
   ``When it comes down to conservative causes, we're about left
with (Sen.) Jesse Helms,'' Billings said in a telephone interview
Monday.

   PARIS (AP) - Masked vandals stoned police and set cars afire
Monday during a demonstration by 100,000 students seeking better
school conditions. It was the first serious outbreak of violence in
four weeks of protests.
   President Francois Mitterrand promised steps would be taken to
address the students' demands. They want more government spending
to improve security, upgrade substandard facilities, modernize
curriculums and hire more teachers.
   The main throng of protesters in Paris was orderly. But several
hundred youths on the fringes looted a clothing store, hurled rocks
at police, beat journalists, smashed bus stops and torched at least
three parked vehicles.
   Police in Paris made at least 20 arrests, using tear gas and
water cannons to disperse troublemakers. Many of the rioters wore
masks and armed themselves with clubs. At least 40 policemen were
injured, as well as unknown number of protesters.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Eve Arden, the comic actress of scores of
films but best known as the teacher with the sharp tongue and soft
heart on the 1950s television series ``Our Miss Brooks,'' died
Monday of heart failure. She was 82.
   Miss Arden, who had been ill for much of the last year with
cancer and heart problems, died at home at 2:30 a.m. with two of
her four children at her side, said her manager, Glenn Rose.
   The veteran actress of stage, screen, radio and television made
a career out of a role she often said she didn't much like - the
best friend who brightened the dramatics with deadpan humor.
   Though a success on stage and screen, including an Oscar
nomination, she was probably best known as the saucy English
teacher on ``Our Miss Brooks,'' first on radio and then on
television. She starred in ``The Eve Arden'' show followed, which
lasted only a season, then appeared in ``The Mothers-in-Law'' with
Kaye Ballard in 1967-69.

   EL PASO, Texas (AP) - Roses are red, violets are blue. But in
the Guadalupe Mountains, they can be yellow too.
   Folks in the Lone Star State may sing about the yellow roses,
but Monday they crowed about a small colony of yellow violets
discovered hanging from a cliff by a park ranger who had lost his
way.
   The rare flower, dubbed the Viola guadalupensis, or Guadalupe
Violet, is eligible for listing as a rare or endangered species,
said John Cook, National Park Service Southwest regional director.
   The plant was found March 22, 1987. It was verified as a species
in June and its discovery was announced Monday at a conference on
national parks attended by 350 federal officials, scientists and
wildlife preservationists.

days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Nov. 19, 1863, President Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg
Address as he dedicated a national cemetery at the site of the
Civil War battlefield in Pennsylvania.
   ``We here highly resolve,'' said President Lincoln, ``that these
dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the
people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
earth.''
   On this date:
   In 1794, the United States and Britain signed the Jay Treaty,
which resolved some of the issues left over from the Revolutionary
War.
   In 1831, the 20th president of the United States, James

- died in New York at age 38.

   Michael Fuchs, chairman and chief executive
officer of the country's oldest and largest pay cable channel,
answers the door in tennis shorts and a sweater.
   It takes two rings of the doorbell and a series of knocks to
summon the head of Home Box Office to the entrance of bungalow 11
at the posh, pink Beverly Hills Hotel.
   Fuchs' delay in answering the door is indicative of the way he
presents himself and his behemoth company during the next 45
minutes.
   Alternately tugging at his shorts and sprawling across a sofa,
Fuchs smacks loudly on a piece of fruit. To specific questions, he
gives vague answers or aggressively counters with queries of his
own.
   Talking to Michael Fuchs is not easy. But then, the leader of
HBO has never prided himself on congeniality.
   He likes to conduct business with an in-your-face attitude. This
does not make him one of the most well-liked men in the
ever-competitive world of cable.
   Fuchs knows this. He thrives on it.
   ``Screw 'em,'' he said when Paramount unsuccessfully threatened
HBO's parent company, Time Inc., with a hostile takeover last year.
   But the vista from which an arrogant Fuchs once surveyed his
competitors is now eroding.
   With 17.3 million subscribers, HBO's growth is stagnant.
   About 22 percent of cable-equipped homes take HBO, the same
number as in 1983. The Comedy Channel, HBO's latest foray into the
overcrowded market of basic cable stations, has been far from a
success.
   Not to mention that arch-rival Viacom International Inc., owners
of basic cable standards such as MTV, Nickolodeon and pay channel
Showtime, started HA!, its own 24-hour comedy station, five months
after HBO.
   Neither has captured the attention of more than 8 million
viewers each in a market where more than half of America's 93.1
million TV households subscribe to cable.
   When Fuchs launched The Comedy Channel a year ago, he called it
HBO's ``manifest destiny.''
   Now, he has changed his tune.
   ``Going out with a basic cable channel right now is like going
through an Indian gantlet,'' Fuchs says of an industry where cable
subscribers already can chose from an average of 30 stations at no
extra cost to their monthly bill. ``We're not masochists.''
   All talks of merging HA! and The Comedy Channel are off, he
says.
   ``I don't want to put any more marbles in the cable business,''
he says. ``We're a plenty big player.''
   Indeed, HBO is. Besides being the No. 1 pay cable channel, the
network also owns Cinemax, 40 percent of the E! entertainment
network, and a newly formed production company that plans
programming for the Big Three networks and other cable services. It
also has a highly lucrative foreign and domestic video distribution
arm.
   The merger of parent company Time Inc. with Warner
Communications now makes HBO part of the world's largest media
conglomerate.
   Still, pay television has lost its momentum. VCRs and a vast
array of basic cable stations such as Turner Network Television and
the USA Network are responsible for helping to stunt pay TV's
growth.
   If venturing into basic cable channels no longer is the future
for HBO, where does it go in an ever-changing cable world?
   And what will HBO offer subscribers who must pay, on the
average, an additional $12 to receive its programming when basic
cable costs already provide made-for-cable movies, classic films,
specials and sports events?
   Fuchs calls such questions ``naive.''
   Look, he says, taking another bite of plum, ``you bring 'em as
good a television program as you can. What does any other network
... what is NBC going to bring their customers?
   ``I still think we do the best movies in cable,'' he says, his
mouth full of fruit. ``We think we're in a very crowded television
world. It's a hell of a lot more crowded now that it's ever been.
   ``Customers who have lived with HBO see it as a little more
experimental, a little more provocative, a little more honest. A
documentary on HBO has more credibility than anywhere else.''
   Last year's ``Murderers Among Us,'' the story of Nazi hunter
Simon Wiesenthal, won HBO an Emmy for writing in a television
movie.
   This month, the network received a leading 100 Award for Cable
Excellence nominations. Among those noted were the series ``Dream
On,'' ``Not Necessarily the News'' and ``Tales From the Crypt'' and
cable movies ``The Image'' and ``Age-Old Friends.''
   Fuchs sees such accolades as a key part of HBO's survival.
   ACE nominations aside, HBO still has not significantly increased
its subscriber base. Asked again how the pay channel plans to keep
up with a market that has slowed its growth, Fuchs replies:
   ``It gets a hundred and thirty ACE nominations when the next guy
gets 30. It gives the best programming on cable, how's that?
   ``But you know that already, don't ya?''
   Actually, as mentioned earlier, it was 100 nominations. And the
next closest competitors were TNT and Showtime, with 31 nominations
each.

<HEAD>Keating Five Hearings Will Test Senator's Judicial Temperament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ask Howell Heflin how he's going to vote on
the nomination of a federal judge, and the Alabama Democrat's stock
reply is that he's ``leaning straight up.''
   It's a reply that captures Heflin's sense of humor, his
political philosophy and his well-cultivated image as a man of
sober, judicial temperament.
   Heflin, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and
now chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, will need all the
judicial temperament he can muster this week when he opens
politically charged public hearings into the links between five
senators and Charles H. Keating Jr., owner of the failed Lincoln
Savings and Loan.
   The panel is trying to determine if $1.3 million in political
donations the five senators accepted from Keating prompted their
intervention on his behalf with banking regulators.
   ``Heflin throughout his career has portrayed himself as someone
who is very judicious, fair, honest and someone who has a judicial
temperament,'' said Patrick Cotter, a University of Alabama
political scientist.
   That reputation has been smudged in recent weeks by GOP
complaints that the panel was delaying a decision to drop the
investigation of two of the five senators - including the only
Republican - until after the midterm elections.
   When the allegations surfaced on the Senate floor, Heflin
responded with uncharacteristic haste. He dashed off a statement
accusing his critics of partisan motives and blasting the
``organized campaign of leaks'' that prompted their charges.
   ``I do not believe that the ethics committee should be placed in
the position of responding to pressure for the benefit of a friend
or friends or the disadvantage of enemies or for a party
position,'' he said.
   The committee's special counsel recommended in September that
the case against Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat
John Glenn of Ohio be dismissed and that investigations proceed
against Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Donald W. Riegle Jr.
of Michigan and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.
   The committee's failure to act on those recommendations sparked
the pre-election partisan recriminations that preceded the panel's
decision to hold public hearings this week on all five senators.
   Heflin said last week he doesn't know how the hearings will be
affected by Cranston's announcement that he has cancer and will
have to undergo either surgery or radiation treatment. If Cranston
is unavailable, he said, the committee will have to decide whether
to proceed without him.
   Heflin, who was re-elected to a third term last week with 61
percent of the vote, purposely maintains a low profile on ethics
cases. When his GOP opponent tried to make a campaign issue of the
committee's failure to act on the special counsel's report, Heflin
refused to respond.
   ``Just because somebody else breaks an oath, that doesn't mean
that I've got to break mine,'' he said, referring to news leaks
about the report. ``Confidentiality is the rule and you have to
play by the rules.''
   Outside the ethics arena, the hulking Heflin - he stands
6-feet-4 and weighs well over 250 pounds - is rarely reticent.
   He's known as one of the Senate's best storytellers. Long before
he met Heflin, Supreme Court Justice David Souter, a New Hampshire
native, said he had heard of Tieless Hawkins and Shoeless Sam, two
fictional characters Heflin has used for decades to entertain
Alabama audiences.
   First elected in 1978, Heflin's Senate career has been dominated
by his efforts to protect home state aerospace, defense and
agricultural interests.
   A fiscal conservative who's rarely met a tax increase he
couldn't oppose, Heflin has been the most consistent Democratic
vote in the Senate for President Bush and former President Reagan.
   The one area where Heflin has parted most often with GOP
presidents has been civil rights. He supported the civil rights
bill that Bush vetoed this year and has opposed any number of
Republican appointees targeted by civil rights groups.
   On the Judiciary Committee, his is one of three swing votes. He
swung against Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in
1987, and for Edwin Meese' controversial nomination to be attorney
general in 1985.
   The ethics spotlight of the Keating Five hearings will be
nothing new for Heflin. He has been chairman or vice chairman of
the committee during his entire Senate career.
   He led the 1982 prosecution of New Jersey Democrat Harrison
Williams, who resigned before the Senate could expel him for his
role in Abscam. And earlier this year, he led the Senate in
denouncing Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., for financial
improprieties.
   Heflin said he used to enjoy the committee because it ``let me
exercise my judicial tools and skills'' in interpreting ethics laws
and rulings for his colleagues. But not anymore.
   ``Now you're dealing with your fellow senators and their
problems, and before long, they look at you as being a policeman,''
he said. ``... When all of this stuff is over, I'll be seeking
relief.''

   To serve as mayor more than 25 years is
remarkable in the most placid of cities. But in Selma, Ala.? Joe
Smitherman has survived volcanic Selma's racial eruptions to win
election seven times. In retrospect, he says, ``If I were black, I
would have agitated, too.'' Now he says enough's enough. He's
stepping down at the end of his current term.

<TEXT>
   Shortly before a heart attack laid him up a
few weeks ago, Mayor Joe Smitherman was ruminating on the formula
that has kept him in office a quarter century. Could it be the one
had something to do with the other?
   ``You start a project,'' he was saying, ``and before you finish
it, start another, and before you finish that one, start another,
and so on.
   ``Be the busiest person in town, doing things for Selma that the
people can see and touch. It never fails. It keeps your friends
happy and your enemies off balance.''
   Those who know Joe Smitherman, friends and enemies, agree he is
a man of action, all right. They say he seems driven. He runs on
high test and makes decisions more on gut instinct than deep
thought. A hip shooter. On this Sunday morning, though, Smitherman
was in a reflective mood.
   The mayor observes a sort of sabbath ritual. He rises early,
drives downtown, parks behind City Hall, enters through a back
door, plugs in the coffeepot and meditates for an hour or so,
alone. On Sunday morning the city hall, on many occasions in this
town the epicenter of shattering tumult, is as peaceful as a
shrine.
   The upheaval that rocked Selma a generation ago changed the
political landscape of the South and rippled through the entire
nation. It is where black Americans, systematically
disenfranchised, won the right freely to vote, to have a say in
their own governance. From that day to this Joe Smitherman has been
mayor of Selma, experiencing all the predictable aftershocks.
   Coffee in hand, feet on desk, Smitherman was saying the other
day that he intends to leave office when his current four-year
term, his seventh, expires in two years.
   Selmians, as they call themselves, have heard that tune before.
In fact, in 1979 after 15 years in office Smitherman, worn out,
stepped aside for a year and gave his gavel to the president of the
city council. When the next election came around, he was back in
the race; he has never lost an election. This time, though,
Selmians are betting the heart attack may influence the mayor's
resolve, and are wondering what is to become of Selma when ``the
Smitherman reign,'' as one historian calls it in a recent volume,
comes to an end.
   ``Selma will do just fine,'' Smitherman said. ``It will have to
because it's time for me to go. I've walked this tightrope long
enough and I'm getting tired. Do you know how wearing this job can
be?''
   Wearing, yes. According to a researcher at the U.S. Conference
of Mayors, it is rare in this country for anyone to last in that
office for as long as 25 years. That would include mayors of
complacent towns where nothing much happens to cause a happy
citizenry to want to change anything.
   If such places exist, this storied town on the blood-red banks
of the Alabama River surely is not one of them.
   Whatever happens in Selma, good or bad, has for the past 25
years been viewed against the backdrop of its past. A surprising
number of visitors still drop by daily to gawk at the city that
became a symbol, its very name a curse, a rallying cry for passage
of the Voting Rights Act back in 1965.
   The old conjure women on the riverbank used to whisper the
legend that stars once fell on Alabama, a powerful omen the land
was cursed. Some in Selma find reason to believe it.
   A historical marker outside City Hall records the two pivotal
events a hundred years apart that marked their city for all time.
   One side commemorates the day in 1865 when Yankee soldiers
sacked the town and burned its Confederate arsenal.
   The other side commemorates the day in 1965, ``Bloody Sunday,''
when troopers and mounted deputies whipped and tear-gassed black
Americans protesting the blatant scheme that denied them the
ballot.
   That event, and the 10 angry weeks of demonstrations leading up
to it, occurred the year after Joe Smitherman took office. It fell
upon him, then, to preside over what could be called Selma's second
Reconstruction.
   Selma, then and now, is a city of about 27,000 almost equally
divided racially, about 52 percent black. But the differences
between then and now are striking.
   The Selma where Smitherman grew up was a cotton town ravaged by
the boll weevil and the Depression. He was born in 1929, the
youngest of six children of a widowed mother who died when he was
11. He was raised in a shotgun house on a dirt street in East
Selma, the wrong side of the tracks, where scrawny chickens
scratched around outhouses.
   Back then Selma was so rigidly segregated that even the fishing
ponds, side by side, were designated ``colored'' and ``white.'' To
Smitherman it was an unquestioned way of life, like lining up
Saturdays on Water Avenue for government surplus food. Those lines,
though, were for both races.
   ``In retrospect,'' said Smitherman, ``especially after I took
office, I knew good and well we were wrong. If I were black I would
have agitated, too. And if I couldn't vote I'd have been an
activist probably more extreme than some who came here.''
   And Selma today? The mayor likes to take visitors on personal
tours. What they see at first glance could serve as a model of
civic progress and racial harmony in any region of America. Side by
side, blacks and whites work, live, shop, worship, vote, serve on
the city council and the school board, patrol together in police
cars.

   Today's generation of Selma blacks take integration for granted
and view Bloody Sunday as something from long ago that they learn
about during Black History Month, like slavery.
   And yet, not unlike cities of all sizes in every region, Selma
still feels the ache of what has become a national migraine reduced
to a single syllable. Race.
   Black eligible voters in Selma and Dallas County now outnumber
whites, barely. Under Smitherman, Selma has gerrymandered its wards
so that five blacks and five whites sit on the city council. The
council president, elected at-large, is currently white. Council
members have an unwritten agreement that a person of the same race
will be appointed to replace any one of them leaving office in
midterm.
   Very often in Selma, seemingly neutral issues that come before
the council are resolved along racial lines. Many chalk it up to
the city's heritage of confrontation. It seems to have left Selma
as fragile as a house of cards, the whole town hoping nobody will
bump the table.
   Somehow Smitherman has managed to keep the balance, to walk the
tightrope as he says, without losing control.
   ``Joe Smitherman is a man of great cunning,'' says the Rev. Fred
Reese. ``He knows how to manipulate the white people to accept
changes that will benefit the black people - and them, too, really.
He knows just how far to go and still keep white support without
losing black support.''
   Reese is the principal of Selma High School. Back in 1964 he was
the head of the Dallas County Voter's League, the person who lured
Martin Luther King to Selma for the voting rights crusade. He was
also one of the few blacks who managed to register to vote despite
the obstacles of the time. In the 1964 mayor's race he voted for
Smitherman.
   ``Joe and I are the same age. We grew up in the same part of
town in similar circumstances,'' said Reese. ``Blacks can identify
with him.''
   For the 30 years before Smitherman ran there hadn't been a real
race for mayor. Selma's ruling gentry passed the office from one of
their number to the next, like a fiefdom. The only requirement was
to keep things as is.
   Smitherman, then, was a brash upstart. He was a gawky young
appliance salesman with a long neck and big ears and no friends at
the country club. He managed to get elected to the city council,
where he became a royal pain. He wanted to do city business in the
open, for example, instead of in the back room. Brash.
   He ran for mayor pledging to represent ``all the people, not the
favored few,'' and his campaign fliers underlined the word ``all.''
   ``I figured everybody had a favored few they didn't like,'' he
said. ``I was right. When I won, the old guard wouldn't even give
me a key to city hall. I had to get one made.''
   The civil rights demonstrations behind him, Smitherman became
the busiest man in town. He pushed through a penny sales tax and
did things people could see and touch - paved and lighted streets,
new garbage trucks, fire engines, sewer lines.
   He became an expert at wheedling money out of Washington, money
the old guard shunned as ``tainted,'' inviting federal
interference.
   ``Only thing tainted about it is t'aint enough of it,''
Smitherman told them.
   And more visible and touchable things appeared, each new project
overlapping the last, new libraries, new city hall, new housing
projects, schools, museums, fountains, trees and flowers and parks.
   Train crossings were a hazard. He stopped a 180-car freight with
a police car and ticketed the conductor for blocking streets. The
railroad rescheduled.
   He refused to pay the city's electric bill until the power
company explained its ``pass-on charges'' so the people could know
what they were paying for.
   When Ku Klux Klansmen showed up on the city hall steps he called
them ``white trash'' and ran them out of town. Blacks applauded. He
padlocked the anti-poverty office because only 5 percent of the
paid employees were white. Not enough. Whites applauded.
   At the 20th anniversary observance of Bloody Sunday, Smitherman
went to the pulpit of Brown Chapel, where Martin Luther King had
preached, and said: ``My hands are as dirty as the others. We were
wrong. I'm sorry.'' He shared a hymnal with Jesse Jackson and sang
``We Shall Overcome.''
   ``I suppose I've been the most visible person in the state short
of the governor,'' Smitherman said, ``and a lot of people expected
me to run for higher office.
   ``When I was younger I gave some thought to it but after a few
terms I discovered it's hard for mayors to do that.
   ``Mayors can't duck issues or avoid taking sides. For mayors,
the public is as close as the sidewalk. You either get the garbage
picked up or you don't. You either remove the dangerous tree or you
don't. You can't tell an angry citizen that you'll have a committee
look into it, not if you want to get re-elected.
   ``Also, you need what I call the Big Mules, the money boys who
finance your campaign and don't let you forget where you got the
money. I've shifted around so much politically, backing Democrats,
Republicans, whatever, that the Big Mules who know me could never
be sure if I'd stay hitched.
   ``Anyhow, Selma is all I really care about and being mayor of
Selma has been sufficient. Two more years and I'm history.''

   ``Here you know generally what you've been exposed to. I think
there is an effort on the part of these facilities to keep some
control over those discharges.''
   The Energy Department says it has spent more than $1 billion to
clean up the area in the last decade. There was a time when
radioactive and hazardous waste was just buried in shallow
trenches. The cleanup effort involves resurrecting the waste and
packaging it in more stable containers. The agency also has drained
settling ponds and paved over them.
   Not everyone is satisfied with the effort.
   Lawsuits have been filed over mercury contamination in the
watershed, and creeks near the plants are posted to stop fishing or
swimming.
   Environmental scientists still are studying the amount of
hazardous materials in sediment of a lake downstream.
   Health studies of the work force from the 1940s on show no
substantial increases in mortality, says Donna L. Cragle, deputy
program leader for the Center of Epidemiologic Research at Oak
Ridge Associated Universities.
   ``I would say it's not any worse than any other place,'' she
says. ``There are mortality studies related to many industries, and
generally these workers look like most of those. There aren't any
of the real strong mortality relationships you see with some of the
others.''
   But Cragle says there has never been a thorough study of the
impact on the health of the general population around the
reservation.
   Hibbitts says living in Oak Ridge is a matter of ``adjusting to
a perception of risk.''
   ``The sorts of things we talk about as far as the risk of
working or living here are very small compared to the risks I live
with on a daily basis,'' he says.
   ``The amount of radiation exposure I get from working here is a
very tiny part of the radiation exposure I get just for being a
human being. If I want to manage my risk in terms of exposure, I
don't move from Oak Ridge, I ventilate my house to get rid of the
radon.''
   Some of the critics of the plants are opposed to nuclear weapons
on principle. They hold a protest every Aug. 6, the anniversary of
the bombing of Hiroshima, and usually manage to get arrested for
trespassing on government property.
   The Peace Alliance headed by Smith is the most visible critic of
the Energy Department's management.
   ``Even if we pardon the past, they're still experimenting,
putting citizens at risk because they've got such a mess they don't
know what to do with it,'' he argues. ``They have tremendous
problems out there. I'm not trying to just criticize, because I
know they've got some good people out there doing their best. But
it's time for this entire country to reassess its nuclear policy.''
   Smith says the question that should be asked is whether the
plants ``have been protecting us or poisonng us.''
   ``We're just shifting the burden to the next generation, and I
can't go along with that,'' he says. ``The fact that they're still
producing nuclear weapons is not acceptable. The greatest threat to
me and my children is the pollution, not some other country's
nuclear weapons.''
   Smith suggests another mighty national effort may be the only
way to reverse the legacy of an earlier one.
   ``We need a Manhattan Project II to clean it up,'' he says.
   Smith says his group, with a core of about 50 people and a
mailing list of 3,000, faces some enmity in the region.
   ``But we've found there is a lot of support out there for what
we're doing. I think there would be more except for the economics.
... We're constantly being forced to choose between short-term
economic well-being and long-term environmental well-being, and to
me that is blackmail.''
   Hibbitts disagrees. He says the citizens are not shrinking
violets and would, if the evidence convinced them their lives were
in danger, raise as much of a protest as necessary to change it.
   The latest environmental flap to ensue from the government
reservation is the pollution in Watts Bar Lake just downstream on
the Clinch River.
   The Energy Department held two public hearings this summer to
tell citizens about the problem and what is being done, which is
mainly to study the nature and extent of the pollution.
   The department says most of the pollution is buried in the
deepest and most stable sediments of the lake, and is therefore
safely out of the way.
   Bob Humphreys is mayor of Kingston, a small town on Watts Bar
just southwest of Oak Ridge. He attended the first hearing, he
says, ``and felt some assurance after that. I think they're doing
more than people realize to monitor that situation.''
   Humphreys says residents of the area are concerned, but adds,
``We've run every kind of test in the world, and according to those
we have nothing to be alarmed about.''
   In the end, Humphreys says people will likely find little to
worry about and certainly not enough to call down the economic
force that may be putting bread on their table.
   ``Oak Ridge is the livelihood for a big percentage of Kingston.
That makes a difference in the way they think.''

   Salman Rushdie and his ``Satanic Verses'' aside,
literature in India is venturing into new territory, crossing
international boundaries. Here's a look at a group of young Indian
writers attracting a lot of attention with their irreverent style.
   ---
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new generation of Indian writers has
burst forth, winning acclaim at home and abroad for everything from
sonnets to satire.
   Inspired by Salman Rushdie and others, they are irreverently
testing the limits of language and venturing into styles rarely
seen in their homeland.
   While some critics say it smacks of elitism, most write in
English, the language foisted on India by colonial rulers but is
now at least as indigenous to India's upper crust as Hindi,
Bengali, Urdu and Tamil.
   ``I learned to read in English, to curse in English, to make
love in English,'' says Shashi Tharoor, author of ``The Great
Indian Novel,'' which is scheduled for release in the United States
this winter. ``I don't think any of my other languages is good
enough to express the ideas.''
   Some, such as Rushdie and Bharati Mukherjee, have left their
homeland, changed their citizenship, and found audiences in their
adopted lands more receptive than those in India.
   Meenakshi Mukherjee, one of India's leading literary critics,
credits Rushdie with breaking international barriers with
``Midnight's Children,'' which won Britain's Booker Award in 1981.
   Rushdie is now a citizen of Britain, where he went into hiding
in February 1989 because of death threats from Moslems enraged by
what they considered the blasphemy of his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   ``Salman Rushdie showed that you can do anything you want,''
says Ms. Mukherjee, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.
``In `Midnight's Children' he uses Bombay as anybody would use
London or New York. He's the first one who didn't have a glossary
to explain Indian terms. If you don't understand, that's your
problem, not my problem.''
   Tharoor and several others, including Amitav Ghosh, Upamanyu
Chatterjee and I. Allan Sealy, stick to their Indian roots in
themes but transcend national boundaries in their literary
migrations, whether geographical, cultural or psychological.
   A few, such as Vikram Seth, tackle the literary world on
universal terms. Seth, author of ``The Golden Gate,'' a 300-page
sonnet of entangled San Francisco loves and lovers, is known in his
hometown of New Delhi as ``the Indian who wrote the great
California novel.''
   Seth, who also wrote a China-Tibet travel book called ``From
Heaven Lake'' and recently published a volume of poems called ``All
You Who Sleep Tonight,'' travels around the world but spends much
of the year in India.
   ``There is a resurgence in India-ness, people being proud of
being Indian,'' says David Davidar, publisher of Penguin Books
(India) Ltd. ``I think the colonial thing is finally being put to
rest. All the younger writers are under 50.''
   Davidar's publishing house has issued more than 40 books of
fiction by Indian writers since its presses started rolling in
1988. Forty percent of Penguin India is owned by the British-based
Penguin company, which means Indian writers picked up by Penguin at
home get an automatic chance at option by Penguin affiliates in
London and New York.
   Indian books have improved technically in the last few years.
Fewer paperbacks fall apart in a shower of pages the first time you
crack the spine. But it's the content that's so markedly improved.
   Tharoor purloined the names of characters from the epic Hindu
poem ``Mahabharata'' (``Great India'') to irreverently populate the
political landscape of 20th century India in ``The Great Indian
Novel.''
   Tharoor's novel, like 18th century Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan
Swift's ``Gulliver's Travels,'' succeeds on seveal levels. At face
value, ``The Great Indian Novel'' is an amusing bit of fantasy. On
a general political plane, it pokes fun at the ambitions and
foibles of presumably fictitious politicians. But to the reader
armed with knowledge of India's modern and mythical heroes and
anti-heroes, the analogies are devastating.

   Dhritarashtra, the blind and ineffectual king in
``Mahabharata,'' is the name Tharoor chooses for his parody of
Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India.
   ``He had the blind man's gift of seeing the world not as it was,
but as he wanted it to be,'' remarks Ved Vyas, Tharoor's narrator.
``Even better, he was able to convince everyone around him that his
vision was superior to theirs.''
   The fictional Vyas, at the age of 88, is dictating his memoirs,
full of barbs, as future Prime Minister Dhritarashtra embarks on
the path that leads to the bloody partition of India and Pakistan,
their still-unresolved dispute over Kashmir and his own
pre-eminence as a founder of modern India and the Third World
non-aligned movement.
   Tharoor, 33, who works for the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees in Geneva, speaks Hindi, French and ``a bit of
Bengali.'' But he says his novel is ``a book that could only have
been written in English. The kind of people who speak English in my
book would normally speak English.''
   Ms. Mukherjee says the new novelists seem to have ``an idiom
that's almost international - irreverent, playful, you make fun of
serious things.'' But she's troubled by their elitism in a country
where only 44 percent of the 880 million people are literate in any
language and only an estimated 4 percent read English.
   ``All of them come through the conduit of the same small
institution,'' she says, referring to Delhi University's St.
Stephen's College. ``I don't feel all that wonderful about it. It
brings home to you the social reality of the books. They're all
really upper class.''
   India's earlier generations of novelists, such as R.K. Narayan,
whose first books were published in the 1930s, were more
self-conscious about writing in English, Ms. Mukherjee says. And
India's only Nobel Prize winner for literature (1913) was
Rabindranath Tagore, who wrote poetry in Bengali.
   The ``elite'' crowd of young novelists, all in their 30s,
includes:
   -Ghosh, who used his native Bengal as the embarkation point for
his ponderous first novel, ``A Circle of Reason,'' and again for
the more delicately crafted ``The Shadow Lines.''
   -Sealy, whose Anglo-Indian ancestry inspired ``The
Trotter-Nama'' and who uses a crazy quilt of literary devices for a
family saga that starts in the late 18th century with the arrival
of Justin Aloysius Trotter in fictional Nakhlau, which resembles
Lucknow during the British Raj.
   -Chatterjee, whose ``English, August: An Indian Story,'' traces
a young Bengali civil servant's search for identity during his
posting to a remote village.
   Less precocious - and less Indian, at least to Indian readers -
is Bharati Mukherjee, 49, who left India to study at the University
of Iowa nearly three decades ago and married a Canadian. She became
a U.S. citizen in 1980.
   Bharati Mukherjee, whose novels and short stories have been
published in the United States for the past 18 years, won America's
National Book Critics Circle Award in 1988 for ``The Middleman and
Other Stories.''
   The central thread in ``Middleman'' is immigrants, and not just
Indians who come to the United States. Her characters include an
Iraqi Jew involved in Central American intrigues, a second
generation Italian-American with an Afghan refugee lover, a Vietnam
War veteran coming to terms with the child he fathered in Saigon.
   ``I like to think I'm writing from the inside about white
America,'' she says. ``For me, America is an idea, an abstract
entity. America is a frontier that needs constant pushing.''

   The televised images of oil-blackened beaches
and dead wildlife dealt a severe blow to tourism in Alaska, the
state's third-largest industry. But now the tourists are beginning
to return and officials hope to lure them off the cruise ships and
railroad cars and into the countryside.

   To try to lure back tourists lost after
the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the Alaska Visitors Association put out
an ad featuring a close-up of Marilyn Monroe's face.
   Without the mole.
   The famous beauty mark on Marilyn's face was missing. The ad
explained that she was beautiful even without her mole, just as oil
spilled in one part of Alaska did not diminish all of the state's
natural wonders.
   Whether that ad deserves the credit or not, tourism officials
say business is on the upswing again, after a sharp drop following
the oil spill in March 1989.
   Tourism is Alaska's third-biggest industry, behind oil and
fishing. Last summer, 560,000 visitors spent more than $300 million
in Alaska, state officials say.
   Tourism fell off following the oil spill, when pictures of
blackened beaches and dead sea otters were televised worldwide. The
spill took an estimated $20 million bite out of Alaska visitor
spending in 1989, says Eric McDowell, a Juneau consultant.
   But tourism rebounded last summer, except at some fishing
lodges, which still suffer from lingering concerns about tainted
fish, McDowell says.
   Stan Stephens, a Valdez tour-boat operator, says his business
this summer was back to pre-spill levels. While some people may be
avoiding the sound, Stephens says about a third of his customers
ask to see Bligh Reef, the submerged rock that ripped open the
Exxon Valdez's hull.
   Diversifying the tourism industry has been a goal of outgoing
Gov. Steve Cowper and many of the small business owners who cater
to Alaska visitors.
   McDowell and others say that most Alaska visitors still arrive
on cruise ships. Even among visitors classified as ``independent''
travelers, many spend part of their Alaska vacation on packaged
tours.
   ``When a destination first develops, people are cautious and
they tend to go in for packaged tours,'' McDowell says. ``But as
information gets out, through word of mouth, independent travel to
Alaska has grown faster than other segments.''
   Advertisers selling Alaska's scenic splendor to tourists in the
1980s usually appealed to retired-age travelers who could see the
wilderness from comfortable cruise ships or railroad viewing cars.
   This fall, however, a nationwide cable television advertising
campaign targeted the independent travelers.
   ``Adventurers Wanted,'' one commercial proclaims.
   Independent travelers aren't content to watch a glacier from
behind a cruise ship window, says Rod Bradley of Anchorage-based
Bradley Advertising, producer of the new ads.
   ``People want the scenic wonders of Alaska to be the backdrop to
their activities: picnicking on a beach, buying items, going to
dinner, fishing,'' Bradley says.
   ``Everyone thinks of himself as an adventurer and the ads play
on the subjective image people have of themselves as
participants.''
   Independent travelers plan their own itineraries instead of
letting a tour company do it, says Dana Brockway, the state
director of tourism. They take shorter, more frequent trips, spend
more money than other travelers and spread it among a wider range
of businesses.
   Additionally, independents provide the tourism industry with its
best chance to extend tourism into more remote parts of the state
and into the winter months.
   ``Independent travelers are where our real market growth has
been this year,'' says Steve Hites of the White Pass and Yukon
Railroad.
   Tourists riding the narrow-gauge railroad out of Skagway arrive
on cruise ships and the Alaska ferry or drive the Alaska-Canada
Highway in recreation vehicles, he says.
   Increasing the ``rubber-tire traffic'' into Alaska is a big part
of the state's strategy to capitalize on the growth of independent
travel, says Bob Miller, director of the Alaska Tourism Marketing
Council.
   State officials in 1992 will use the 50th anniversary of the
building of the Alaska Highway to promote independent travel to
Alaska.
   ``We need to soften the harsh image of the Alaska Highway,''
Brockway says. ``Few people know it's virtually all paved and
there's more to do along the way.''
   Although independent travelers are being wooed with images of
adventure, they are not coming to Alaska to rough it.
   ``They want rustic charm, they want to sink their teeth into it
and they want a bath at night,'' Hites says.
   Even the cruise ship operators are starting to emphasize
adventure in their marketing of Alaska.
   ``People want to get out and be a little more active. They're
younger. They go on raft trips, ride helicopters,'' says Howard
Clifford of Princess Tours. ``It's a little more daring.''
   Cowper says he's trying attract investment, particularly
Japanese, in winter recreation and tourism facilities, such as a
northern lights viewing center.
   ``We need to increase the tourist season from three months to
seven months,'' he says. ``To do that, we need more facilities.''

   At an age when most of their peers are knitting
sweaters or puttering around in the garden, thousands of older
citizens are trying to catch up with their kids and grandkids on
the keyboards of their computers. Computer training centers for
people 55 and older are springing up across the country.

   At age 69, Joanna Goodblood joined
the revolution, the telecommunications revolution.
   ``I want to know as much about computers as my daughter knows,''
says Mrs. Goodblood, one of the newest recruits in SeniorNet, a
non-profit organization that teaches fundamental computer skills to
people 55 and older.
   SeniorNet, based at the University of San Francisco, runs 35
computer training centers in 17 states and Canada.
   The newest center is at Johnson County Community College in this
Kansas City suburb, where Goodblood and 35 others are enrolled in
three computer classes. Thirty others are on a waiting list.
   ``A lot of time people when they get old are intimidated by
technology,'' Mrs. Goodblood says as her classmates peck away on
their keyboards during their second day of class. ``But this is a
way to get into it without your feeling like a dodo.''
   Since it started in 1986, SeniorNet has trained more than 4,000
older adults to use computers. About 1,100 have signed up for a
SeniorNet network that allows them to send and receive messages to
one another using personal computers linked to a telephone system.
   ``The people in our classes aren't in there for their resumes,''
says Mary Furlong, an education professor at the University of San
Francisco and a founder of SeniorNet. ``The majority want to keep
learning. They want to keep up with their children and
grandchildren.''
   Furlong and a colleague began SeniorNet in 1983 as a research
project. They wanted to find out whether older people would be
willing to learn about computers and use them.
   Industry surveys have found that only 9 percent of adults 60 to
69 years old own computers, and only 3 percent of those older than
70. By contrast, about 20 percent of all U.S. households have
computers.
   ``What we discovered was older adults were very interested and
very capable ... largely because they had more time to learn,''
says Furlong, who co-authored a book titled ``Computers for Kids
over 60.''
   ``Seniors bring patience and expertise to their computer
learning,'' she says. ``They find that using computers can open new
doors for them, once they overcome their initial fear of the
technology.''
   For a $25 fee, members receive a two-month, hands-on training
course and a quarterly newsletter. They also can make a $15
membership payment for access to the network that connects them
with each others' computers. They are charged $5.70 an hour for
their on-line time.
   The computer curriculum includes, among other things, training
on how to write letters, do newsletters and run budgets, Furlong
says.
   On the network, members go on line every Wednesday night to
correspond and debate issues, such as the Persian Gulf situation
and the stock market.
   Many of the students, who have ranged in age from 55 to 95, have
used their computer training for such things as cataloging
collections and tracking investment portfolios.
   ``I'm in a lot of groups and a computer would be a convenient
way of helping me with file-keeping and my records,'' says
65-year-old Lee Fisher, another SeniorNet student.
   The John and Mary R. Markle Foundation of New York is the chief
financial supporter of SeniorNet, which is the first nationwide
effort to help older adults participate in the telecommunications
revolution.
   Computer centers are located in schools, community centers,
nursing homes and eye-care centers.
   The college was chosen as the site because of its willingness to
provide its computer education resources, says Cathie Peterson, a
college spokeswoman. The college has provided the computers,
computer labs and instructor.
   Some critics contend that working on computers will contribute
to the isolation of senior citizens. But those involved with
SeniorNet disagree.
   ``The communication we're trying to establish is like that of a
park in the 1990s,'' Furlong said. ``You may not be able to walk
across town, but if you go on line everybody is right there.''

   She was one of the most celebrated opera singers
of all time. Joan Sutherland retired last month after a career that
spanned almost 40 years, but hers is a voice that won't soon be
forgotten. Her colleagues remember her as a true prima donna who
worked hard at her craft and didn't put on airs.

   When Joan Sutherland made her Italian debut in
1960 in Handel's ``Alcina,'' the tough Venice audience rose and
shouted ``La Stupenda.''
   Fans have been calling the Australian diva that ever since. Dame
Joan, who recently retired after nearly 40 years, has had one of
the most significant careers in the history of opera.
   One of her fans is tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who knows stupendous
singing when he hears it. ``I think to the world of opera she has
meant the greatest coloratura soprano of all time,'' he says. ``We
do not know what Giuditta Pasta (for whom Bellini wrote ``Norma''
in 1831) and others sounded like, but I don't think they can be
vocally better than Joan Sutherland.''
   Lotfi Mansouri, general director of the San Francisco Opera, has
directed Dame Joan in more operas than any other director. ``Joan
is one of the absolutely greatest in the field of opera in the last
30 years,'' he says. ``I had the great fortune of working with her
the first time I directed, in 1963. It was a production of
`Sonnambula' by Bellini.''
   Mansouri's production of ``The Merry Widow'' was Dame Joan's
last American performance. That was a year ago in Dallas, the same
city where she first sang opera in the United States.
   Dame Joan retired, at 63, in October at the Sydney Opera House,
less than half a mile from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music where
she began her career in 1951. Tickets for the final performance,
Mansouri's production of Meyerbeer's ``The Huguenots,'' cost up to
$415.
   ``She was a unique artist,'' Mansouri says. ``She had a very
extreme vocal range. Most of the time coloraturas are smaller,
lighter voices. Joan had a lush middle register. She always had a
very good ear. Her pitch was always accurate.
   ``Maria Callas revived the bel canto and the mantle was passed
to Joan. She had more vocal flexibility than Callas.''
   Dame Joan's colleagues note that she brought unfamiliar operas
into the repertoire, giving operagoers more variety. They talk of
her as a prima donna who didn't put on airs, worked hard and was an
inspiration.
   ``The only thing she would ever argue about,'' Mansouri says,
``is, she would say, `You're overestimating my ability.'
   ``I asked her in the second act of `Die Fledermaus' to dance
part of the czardas. She said, `Are you crazy? Dancing it and
singing it at the same time? You must be joking.' Then she'd go
ahead and do it. She was very game.
   ``The last time I directed her was in Toronto in `Hamlet.' She
said, `I'm a grandmother. You don't want me to do Ophelia.' Finally
I convinced her. She was absolutely wonderful. Her mad scene was
something I'll never forget. It was the last new role she ever
learned.''
   Some critics point out that Dame Joan didn't always articulate
consonants. Her voice was silver, like a flute, while some
preferred warmer sounds, and her acting sometimes seemed detached.
   ``I don't believe that business that she was not a good
actress,'' Mansouri says. ``She was not an intellectual type
actress. She was very honest, sincere. She would bring a lot from
herself.''
   While Dame Joan sang operas that other sopranos sing, such as
``La Traviata,'' she also sang the early 19th-century operas of
Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti that most others couldn't sing.
   The primary interest in those bel canto operas is melody and
voice. The verismo school, where realism and big orchestras reign,
began at the end of the 19th century.
   Tenor Alfredo Kraus, who sang often with Dame Joan, says, ``At
the same time we are artists, we are teachers. It is easy to give
audiences what they know. If you give them what they don't know,
you are giving them education.''

   Dame Joan never tried to hold a throne alone. The reigning Norma
of her day, she suggested to soprano Montserrat Caballe that she
sing ``Norma.'' Caballe was afraid to try but Dame Joan was
persuasive. Then there were two highly successful Normas.
   When Dame Joan sang Norma, the mezzo-soprano was usually Marilyn
Horne. Horne, a one-time soprano, was inspired by Sutherland to
take up the coloratura mezzo and contralto roles in which she had
made her fame.
   ``The world was ready for this stuff again,'' says Horne.
``Along came this unbelievable singer who could do these things.
Joan is really the best.
   ``I think there aren't a lot of singers who do something
original, something that really contributes to the history of the
world of music and Joan is one of those people. She not only sang
gloriously but she has revived all these fabulous things.
   ``And we must also talk about Joan's revivals of French music
and contribution to the Baroque. She has been a major Handel singer
and done Baroque opera. This has been a significant vocal lady.''
   The 1955 premiere of Sir Michael Tippett's ``The Midsummer
Marriage'' also had Sutherland in the cast.
   Maria Callas' career was winding down when Sutherland ``hit'' in
1959. One of Sutherland's first roles at Covent Garden was as
Callas' maid in ``Norma.''
   ``If you study Callas' repertoire, it was not so vast,'' Horne
says. ``Joan did many operas Callas didn't do; she's been in there
slugging it out for many years.''
   Whether bel canto operas will continue to be sung after Dame
Joan depends on whether somebody comes along who can sing them.
   Horne believes that, thanks to Dame Joan's bringing those operas
back into favor, voice students increasingly will study bel canto
technique. ``It has opened up a whole repertoire for young
singers.''
   Dame Joan's husband since 1954 is conductor Richard Bonynge.
``Hand in hand, Rick goes with Joan,'' Horne says. ``She was the
great voice. He was really the guiding light. He has nurtured and
protected that voice. He has been devoted to her and that
instrument.''
   Mansouri says, ``She's fortunate her husband is such a good
musician. She was offered an enormous variety of roles. He advised
her not to accept things not good for her voice. Some singers say
yes to everything and pretty soon the voice is gone.''
   Sutherland took Pavarotti with her on his first major tour,
through Australia, soon after his first American appearance. That
was with her in 1965 in Miami in ``Lucia di Lammermoor.''
   ``She was a great inspiration,'' Pavarotti says. ``She was
always there ready to sing, never late to a performance and always
giving suggestions.''
   Mansouri says, ``A Joan Sutherland doesn't come along every day.
She's once in a lifetime. It was an honor to work with her.''

   Actress Deborah Raffin got the idea for
turning Jack Higgins' World War II thriller ``Night of the Fox''
into a miniseries while producing the story as an audio tape.
   ``After reading it I thought it would make a good miniseries,''
says Raffin, who runs Dove Books on Tape with her husband, Michael
Viner. Dove also publishes books and produces movies and
miniseries.
   Raffin says at first she didn't intend to be in the miniseries
herself.
   ``I thought I'd co-produce, as I've done occasionally in the
past,'' she says. ``But after we developed the script, Michael and
Charles Jarrott, the director, asked me to be in it. I'm glad I
did.''
   ``Night of the Fox,'' also starring George Peppard, Michael
York, David Birney, John Mills and John Standing, will be televised
in national syndication. The two parts will be shown in the coming
week, with the day and time of the broadcasts left to individual
stations.
   Raffin plays a British nurse who is drafted into a mission to
rescue an American colonel seeking refuge on the German-occupied
English Channel island of Jersey after his ship is sunk. The
colonel knows the plans for the D-day invasion and must be rescued
- or silenced - before the Nazis find him.
   Birney is the American colonel, Peppard is a mysterious
intelligence agent and York has a double role as German Field
Marshal Erwin Rommel and his official impostor. It was directed on
location in Yugoslavia by Jarrott, who also directed Raffin in one
of her first films, ``The Dove.''
   ``My character, Sara, is a very practical-minded and good human
being who's recently widowed,'' Raffin says in an interview at her
home. ``Birney is kept hidden at her aunt's house. Peppard
masquerades as a Nazi officer and she as his French mistress.
   ``That means she has to change her looks, demeanor and attitude.
The fun of the piece is that everyone is impersonating someone
else. We're all fakes and making believe.''
   The miniseries also calls for Raffin to play Sara at age 70 and
that led to an accident removing makeup that injured her eyes.
   ``It was a fluke,'' she says. ``We had a wonderful makeup man.
He was using some kind of linseed oil to remove the acrylic makeup
from my face. Some of the oil got into my eyes. The next day by
noon the pain was excruciating.
   ``Dissolved pieces of acrylic in the oil had rubbed off a
protective area of the cornea. I couldn't read or do anything for
five or six days. I was very lucky. I was able to go back to
work.''
   Raffin made her film debut in ``Forty Carats'' in 1973 as Liv
Ullmann's teen-age daughter. Since then she has been in several
movies, including ``The Dove,'' ``Once Is Not Enough,'' and
``Touched By Love,'' and such TV movies as ``Willa'' and
``Haywire.''
   Her most recent miniseries was ``Noble House'' and she just
finished a horror movie called ``Scanners II.''
   She co-produced the miniseries ``Windmills of the Gods'' with
Michael Viner.
   ``When I'm an actress I don't want to have anything to do with
producing,'' she says. ``But I really enjoy the producing end.
Acting's my first choice, but being able to produce is a great
luxury for an actress. I don't have to do scripts I'm not enamored
with. I can develop and produce projects. I'm also very involved
with Dove Books.''
   Raffin and her husband are also developing another Higgins'
World War II thriller, ``Cold Harbor,'' as a miniseries. Her next
acting assignment will be in ``Morning Glory,'' a feature film from
Dove based on a 1940s period novel by LaVeryle Spencer.
   ``I was doing `Social Security' on stage in Florida and Michael
sent me some books to abridge for audio tapes,'' she says.
```Morning Glory' was one of the books and I fell in love with it.
I want to do it as a film.''
   Raffin's large hillside home is filled with Oriental and Hindu
artifacts that reflect her interest in mysticism. She has traveled
frequently in the East and spent a number of months in Hong Kong
while filming ``Noble House.''
   ``I love that part of the world,'' she says. ``I'm attracted to
art, literature, artifacts and handicrafts that have a mystical
quality. Fortunately I'm in a profession where you get to travel
and benefit from many cultures.''
   Her first book, ``Sharing Christmas,'' was edited from
contributions she sought from 100 celebrities. It has just been
published by Dove and Warner Books.
   She said all of the book profits will go to the homeless.
   ``I wrote, called people, stood on my head, whatever I could do
to get people to share their Christmas memories,'' she says. ``The
first people I heard from were Richard Nixon and Margaret Thatcher.
We`re talking about making it into a television special.''

<HEAD>Big Question in Hong Kong: How To Deal With The Communists?</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Kwok was a boy when the Chinese
Communists broke their promise 40 years ago and seized his family's
industrial empire in Shanghai.
   Now he's a leading businessman in Hong Kong and has founded a
pro-China political party. Kwok assures the people of this British
colony that what happened to his family won't happen to them when
Beijing takes over in 1997.
   ``Times have changed,'' said Kwok, 52. ``We can't let history
weigh us down.''
   Tell that to Jimmy McGregor.
   In 1967, the hard-headed Scot, then a top colonial official,
braved nail bombs and death threats to help quell
Communist-inspired riots in which scores of people were killed.
   Today, McGregor leads a party that demands more democracy in
Hong Kong and greater protection from China.
   ``I've seen what the Communists can do,'' the 66-year-old lawyer
said. ``They haven't changed a bit.''
   Differences between McGregor and Kwok cut to the heart of Hong
Kong's big question about the future: How should you deal with the
Communists?
   With great deference, members of Kwok's Liberal Democratic
Foundation believe.
   Party members say they are willing to accept limits on freedom
after 1997 so long as they can maintain Hong Kong's economic might.
A per capita annual gross national product of $9,230 gives the 5.7
million people on this collection of rocks the second highest
living standard in Asia after Japan.
   ``You can't avoid China,'' Kwok said. ``It has to have a say.''
   To men like McGregor, the economy of Hong Kong rests on its
liberties. Restrict the free exchange of ideas, tamper with the
independent judicial system and the economy will tremble, they say.
   Debate will accelerate as 1997 approaches.
   First under the microscope will be China's promise, in a 1984
treaty with Britain, to maintain the laissez-faire economic and
social system for 50 years and allow Hong Kong to govern itself.
   Some analysts fear China will try to manipulate the 1991
election, in which fledgling political parties will have their
first chance at seats on the Legislative Council.
   Eighteen of the 60 seats will be filled by direct vote. The
other members will be chosen as all the seats were in the past -
either by government appointment or through elections by special
interest groups, such as teachers and businessmen.
   China-watching Contemporary magazine recently reported that
Beijing will donate about $50,000 to pro-China candidates. Zhou
Nan, China's highest-ranking representative in Hong Kong, has said
it will give ``moral support'' to friends.
   Zhou expressed support for Kwok's party in September and
encouraged cooperation among the numerous pro-China groups in Hong
Kong.
   An unusual alliance between business and labor resulted. Kwok
and his party cemented ties with the pro-Beijing Hong Kong
Federation of Trade Unions, which instigated the 1967 riots
McGregor helped crush.
   ``You'd be surprised about what we have in common with those
businessmen,'' said Leung Hon Hoi, a trade union boss. ``For one,
we are both very patriotic.''
   McGregor views such alliances with great suspicion. He likens
trusting the Communists in Hong Kong to trusting ``an untrained
mechanic with a Rolex watch.''
   His party, the Hong Kong Democratic Foundation, wants to
insulate the territory from Chinese influence. It says more
legislative seats should be elected by direct vote and laws should
be passed to guarantee basic liberties.
   In McGregor's view, China understands only confrontation.
   During the 1967 crisis, McGregor, then an official in the
Department of Commerce and Industry, violated protocol by closing
the territory's pro-Communist schools. He believed bombs were being
made in chemistry labs.
   What saved him from losing his job, McGregor said, was a
laboratory explosion that blew off a student's arm.
   ``The way to beat these men is to fight them tooth and nail,''
he said.
   Kwok contends McGregor's pugnacious attitude could hurt the
territory.
   ``If you make the Chinese lose face by forcing them into a
corner, they will never forget it,'' he said. ``We must
cooperate.''
   According to Kwok, the territory's relationship to China is like
a bridge game in which Beijing holds the best hand.
   ``We've got one trump card - money,'' he said. ``They hold
everything else. If they get really mad, they can turn off the
water and the lights. Then where would we be?''
   Kwok recalls growing up with stories about Communist authorities
promising his relatives they wouldn't touch the factories,
warehouses and department store in Shanghai.
   In the end, an empire of nine textile mills, one of the biggest
department stores in Shanghai and 20,000 employees disappeared.
   Shrewd business deals in Hong Kong propelled the family back to
prosperity, and their Wing On Co. is worth more than $100 million.
Kwok was educated at Harvard and MIT, where he received a doctorate
in computer science.
   The Shanghai experience did not turn the family against China,
and Kwok noted: ``Hong Kong is different than Shanghai. It's
protected by an international agreement.''
   He and his party colleagues also have their own interests to
protect. Many members are leading businessmen with substantial
stakes in China's development, like the Kwok family's company.
   In early 1988, Wing On completed renovating Shanghai's first
great department store, which opened in September 1918. The Kwok
family once owned it.

   While Hong Kong's politicians argue about the
future, most people in Hong Kong take little interest in politics.
   The educated and well-off are worried about getting out or
getting rich. Laborers and clerks are too busy working seven days a
week, trying to squeak by.
   A government voter-registration drive highlighted the apathy
many people feel about the British colony's fate after it is
returned to China in 1997.
   More than $700,000 was spent on the voter registration campaign,
to pay for television ads, a poster campaign and even a rock
concert. The government has held registration drives before, but
this was by far the biggest.
   Response was so low that the government extended the
registration deadline by one month to Nov. 1. The number
registering totaled 225,000, bringing to just over 1.8 million the
number of people registered, less than half the territory's 3.7
million eligible voters.
   Registering to vote pales before Hong Kong's burning issues:
emigration and whether lottery tickets should be sold in
supermarkets.
   ``Becoming a voter? I don't even know whether I'm qualified,'
said Lam Cho-fai, a 24-year-old university graduate.
   A voter has to be 21 years old and a resident of the territory
for seven years.
   ``I can't see the point in becoming a voter,'' said Danny Yam, a
24-year-old television producer. ``It won't make any difference.
Everybody here knows China is the boss, and it's so pointless to go
the opposite way your boss wants.''
   Britain's last great colony passes to China in 1997. Like Lam,
many in the territory think China already calls the shots in Hong
Kong.
   Many doubt China's promise to maintain the colony's capitalist
economic system for 50 years after it resumes control. Those doubts
increased after the military crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in China last year.
   Instead of registering to vote, many people are voting with
their feet. More than 1,150 emigrate every week. This year, an
estimated 62,000 people will flee Hong Kong, up 47.6 percent from
last year.
   Analysts say Britain's colonial tradition is partly to blame for
the indifference to politics.
   ``After nearly 150 years of colonial rule, people in Hong Kong
know very little about politics because we have been discouraged to
educate students on that subject,'' said Robert Au, vice chairman
of the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union.
   Only recently have high school textbooks mentioned China-Hong
Kong relations, Au said. Teachers say instruction on the issue
still emphasizes memorizing information, not critical thinking.
   Another problem is that Hong Kong's political system gives
little power to elected officials. Most poer lies with the
governor, now appointed by Britain and to be chosen by China after
1997.
   Hosts of radio talk shows, quite popular in Hong Kong, say few
of their listeners bring up politics.
   ``We have a lot more other calls debating whether making lottery
tickets available for sale in supermarkets would encourage gambling
among the younger generation,'' said Lee Luen-fai, who has a
morning call-in program.
   Lau Chi-man, another host, said people tend to care more about
their own futures than the territory's future.
   ``Many people here reckon their future lies somewhere outside
Hong Kong and are trying their best to find ways to emigrate,'' Lau
said.
   Lately, Lau said, his show has been overwhelmed by callers
asking whether they qualify to emigrate.
   In August, the government lined up the territory's leading
singers to encourage people to vote.
   Rock star Anita Mui told a packed house: ``I hope you'll join me
in becoming a voter to demonstrate our support for Hong Kong's
future.''
   One fan's response: ``That's easy for her to say. She can leave
whenever she likes.''

<HEAD>Democracy Means Less Representation for Women in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ranks of women members were a showpiece in
the sham parliaments of Communist regimes. Then democracy came to
Eastern Europe, and most of the women were gone.
   A survey by the Inter-Parliamentary Council in Geneva found that
all parliaments in the former Soviet bloc have fewer women members
than before Communist parties fell from power last year.
   The sharpest decline was in Romania, where women made up 34
percent of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's rubber-stamp assembly.
After the May elections, only 4 percent of the legislators are
women.
   ``While, under Ceausescu, there were quotas for skirts in the
parliament ... that didn't reflect political reality,'' said
Cristina Popescu, a feminist and editor of the newspaper Romania
Libera newspaper. ``Now, what you see is what you've got.''
   New issues may galvanize women - Poland is on the verge of
outlawing abortion, legal since 1956 - but there is virtually no
tradition of real power for them in either the Communist system or
the former opposition movements.
   Strong forces are holding women back.
   To them falls most of the exhausting daily grind of finding a
family's food, clothing and small pleasures in shortage-plagued
economies.
   Social custom causes women to marry early, have children
immediately and dote on them. The Roman Catholic Church,
predominant in Poland and strong elsewhere, encourages a
traditional family model and has considerable political influence.
   Women have virtually no organizations they can use as a basis
for political power.
   The search for equality on which Western women, men and
institutions embarked 25 years ago found no mirror in the Communist
world.
   Communist leaders often dismissed ``women's lib'' as a foible of
indulged, immoral capitalists. Opposition groups did not welcome
women to their leaderships or pursue women's issues in the battle
against communism.
   Little sensitivity to women's equality is evident in the new
democracies.
   Government commissions and public forums usually are men-only,
and assumptions about women are rampant. A Western diplomat recalls
repeatedly explaining that she was not making an error in Polish
when she identified herself as a ``secretarz'' of her embassy, not
a ``secretarka'' on the clerical staff.
   Those few women in the East who would call themselves feminists
are only beginning to look at the way schoolbooks stereotype male
and female roles. Suggestions that advertisements seeking Western
investors should be addressed to ``executives'' and not
``businessmen'' are greeted with blank stares.
   ``The word `feminist' was ridiculed, the media made fun of
Western women and I didn't believe there were other women who
believed as I did,'' said Hanna Jankowska, who helped found
Poland's fledgling ProFemina group after meeting like-minded women
at a small rally against the anti-abortion law.
   Ms. Jankowska and others blame the fake equality of the
Communist system. Now that it has crumbled, women are likely to
retreat rather than jump at new possibilities, they predict.
   ``Women did not fight for emancipation; it was given to them
with the new socialist system,'' she said. ``Many people connect
the two.
   ``For many women, the practical effect of this emancipation is
they have to go to work. They have two shifts, at work and then for
the home. They are very tired and would prefer to stay home.''
   After Bulgaria's elections in June, women made up 3.5 percent of
the parliament, down from 21 percent. The Hungarian parliament is 7
percent female, down from 21 percent before free elections.
   Poland's parliament, chosen partly by democratic elections, is
12 percent women, compared with 20 percent when the Communist Party
picked all candidates.
   ``The situation in most of the post-Communist countries is more
or less the same,'' said Izabela Nowacka of the Polish League of
Women, a Communist-aligned organization now seeking an independent
identity.
   ``A certain number of seats were allotted to women in Parliament
and it was due to this (Communist) system that women were allowed
to enter government institutions, but not the women who had
something to say.''
   The Communists also had quotas for farmers, steel workers and
miners. Their elimination in Poland also reduced working-class
participation in Parliament, where 83 percent of members now have
university educations, compared with 60 percent previously.
   No women have positions of power in Solidarity, which was born
in 1980 during a Gdansk shipyard strike that started over the
firing of a female crane operator. Even in the textile center of
Lodz, where the vast majority of mill workers are women, Solidarity
always has been led by men.
   When Solidarity was banned in 1981 and thousands of members were
interned under martial law, women played important, but supporting,
roles.
   They helped activist husbands, made placards and distributed
literature. Their highest representation was in the underground
press, where many wrote under male pseudonyms.
   Only two women were among the 57 participants in talks between
Solidarity and the Communists that laid the groundwork for the
transfer of power in 1989. Just one woman minister, in charge of
culture, serves in the new government.
   The anti-abortion campaign, a product of Solidarity's close
alignment with the church, conservative nationalism and all things
anti-Communist, has roused some women.
   ``For the first time in postwar Poland, women became aware that
their rights are in danger,'' Ms. Jankowska said. ``We are at the
very beginning of organizing women in this country. It is a
difficult task, but this abortion issue has awakened women.''
   Generally, however, there is little optimism for substantially
increased involvement or professional advancement by this
generation of women in Eastern Europe.
   Winners of Polish parliament seats ``were very much connected
with the church and the traditional model of family,'' said Dr.
Zofia Kuratowska, deputy Senate speaker and one of the few ranking
women in Solidarity.
   She said the spring elections probably will produce an even more
conservative assembly after a battle among fledgling parties in
which women have little place.
   Ms. Kuratowska noted that women comprised only about 10 percent
of candidates in the May local elections. Municipal contests often
are a starting point for political activists.
   Worn down by work, shopping and child care, women appear likely
to succumb to the widespread Eastern European attitude that the
authorities will do whatever they want in the end.
   Activists say many women already have retreated into their
private lives, tuning out the political system.
   ``A woman can only influence public life after she has done the
shopping, the laundry, put the children to bed,'' Eva Uhrova said.
   ``In the meantime, men, who have this time to themselves, can
devote it to politics,'' said Ms. Uhrova, editor of a women's
magazine in Czechoslovakia, where women hold 6 percent of the
parliament seats, compared with 29 percent under the Communists.
   Women who were asked whether they wanted to advance
professionally were ``terrified'' of taking on another obligation,
according to a Polish survey.
   ``Due to exhaustion, women are reluctant to learn something new,
such as a computer,'' said Ms. Nowacka of the women's league. ``We
want to tell them they should take fate in their own hands, because
now there are great opportunities.''

   Jean Kahn, president of the Representative Council of Jewish
Institutions in France, issued a statement in August saying,
``Manifestations of anti-Semitism in France have sometimes been
over-dramatized in other countries.''
   ``We feel this is not justified, because it does not reflect
French reality,'' the statement added. ``Except for the tragic
period of 1939-45...the Jews of France for the last 200 years have
been completely integrated into the national community.''
   Crozier says, ``The Jewish element is part of the French
identity, as it is part of the American identity. We can accept
anyone, provided he accepts our culture. That's why the Moslems are
such a problem. They have a culture of their own which we do not
recognize.''
   Some sociologists and others say this sense of insecurity
explains the rise of the extreme-right National Front party of
Jean-Marie Le Pen. Le Pen contends that traditional French values
are being corrupted by foreign influences.
   Le Pen, who wants to deport North African immigrants, says
France risks becoming an Arabic-speaking, Moslem nation if
immigration is not stemmed.
   The National Front, the most powerful far-right group in Europe,
consistently holds about 15 percent of the electorate.
   France inherited its Moslem population, mainly North African,
from its disintegrating colonial empire. Thousands were lured
across the Mediterranean from 1960 to 1975 to man the factories
during an economic boom.
   Tin-roofed shantytowns that sprung up around major cities to
house the workers eventually were razed to make way for concrete
apartment buildings. Cut off from city life, ill-managed and
deteriorating, these high-rise complexes remain the principal
source of housing for immigrant families.
   ``This is a basic problem which will weigh for years on our
society,'' said President Francois Mitterrand in response to
October riots in a low-cost housing complex outside Lyon. The
projects ``provoke rejection, despair and make dialogue
difficult.''
   ``At the moment, it's hard to find a real Frenchman,'' said a
35-year-old Algerian. ``They're all rich and removed.''
   The Algerian, who refused to give his name, owns the Cafe Balzac
at the corner of two housing complexes near Vitry, south of Paris.
He has lived in France since he was a baby but refuses to exercise
his right to become a French citizen.
   ``They exploited my parents, they have done nothing for me,'' he
said. ``We are badly viewed, so why accept something they don't
really want to give you? I have my pride.''
   Many Algerians feel they are an unwanted reminder of the
inglorious eight-year war France vainly waged to keep Algeria a
colony.
   France tried early on to rid itself of what clearly was becoming
the immigrant burden, arranging to pay off workers and their
families willing to return to their homeland. The program largely
failed and officials now grope for ways to promote cultural
integration.
   The immigrant question shares the political agenda with the
``new Europe,'' an interloper of another sort.
   France has been a driving force toward unity, challenging the
European Community to go beyond the open frontiers of 1992 toward
political union.
   But the bravado masks worries that are particularly French - how
to remain rigorously independent in an interdependent community of
nations and retain the national identity that is, it often seems,
France's ``raison d'etre.''
   ``France currently is facing its most profound identity crisis
since the advent of the Fifth Republic (in 1958),'' according to
Gregory Flynn, a European affairs specialist with the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
   The French, he wrote in The Wall Street Journal, ``fear for
identity more than security'' and worry about losing all traces of
their status as a world power.
   France appears well-placed to assume a leadership role in a
united Europe, but questions arise about its willingness to
suppress its nationalistic instincts.
   ``Everything is happening as though the French, no longer able
to change the world or protect themselves from it, persuaded
themselves that as a nation they can do nothing at all,'' says the
government-ordered report on the state of the nation.
   The French have long sought to protect their national identity,
politically and culturally, the report says. ``From now on, they
will have to choose other criteria for success.''
   Many experts are optimistic.
   Todd, a member of the government panel, says France has far more
confidence now than a few decades ago, when the folly of grandeur -
``a perverse national obsession'' - bolstered a humiliated nation.
   ``France is one of the European countries changing most
quickly,'' Todd says, ``so it's normal that some people have
doubts, nostalgia, dream of a peaceful and tranquil France.''
   Crozier says, ``You don't redefine what is French. It's not an
intellectual operation. It's something that just happens.''

<HEAD>Saturday School Teaches Youngsters To Think</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When other children across America are sleeping
late, 48 kids from Baltimore and surrounding counties are in
``Saturday School,'' dissecting coconuts and scrutinizing current
events.
   The goal: to teach them how to think.
   Nine-year-old Ayanna Harrison reasoned that the swimming death
of a 15-year-old boy with asthma could have been avoided had he
been honest with his mother.
   ``She might have kept him home or sent a note to school to
excuse him from swimming if she had known there would be a swimming
test that day,'' Ayanna told her classmates as they closely
examined a newspaper article about the accident.
   ``That mother didn't think much about him and made him go,''
said Paul Weinberg, 10, fingering a paragraph saying the youth
``begged his mother to let him stay home but - unaware that he
faced a swimming test - she told him to go to school and get good
grades.''
   The mother, in fact, has said she sent a note to school asking
that the child be excused from swimming that day.
   In two nearby classrooms, teachers Linda McClelland and Sally
Duff used coconuts to guide sixth and seventh graders in the art of
observing. The biggest problem for the youngsters was finding the
patience to completely examine the outside before smashing the
coconut to get the juice and meat. Discussing the best possible way
to open the coconut took time, too.
   And teacher Thomas Payne explored genetic engineering with his
eighth and ninth graders to help them formulate meaningful
questions, identify pertinent data and determine fallacies and
biases.
   These youngsters are participating in the Saturday School
program twice a month at Coppin State College, home of the Maryland
Center for Thinking Studies. Considered the first of its kind in
the country, the program teaches students ``how'' to think in a
variety of ways, not ``what'' to think.
   ``We do not teach math or engineering or science or social
studies,'' said director Toni Worsham. ``We teach children how to
solve problems, how to make decisions, how to become less
impulsive, how not to jump to conclusions and how to be creative
and look for other possibilities. And, we deal with real issues.''
   The national education goals developed by President Bush and the
nation's governors stress the importance that students,
particularly college graduates, ``demonstrate an advanced ability
to think critically, communicate effectively and solve problems.''
   After a year of planning and writing curriculum, the Saturday
School opened in September 1989, with about 43 students from
Baltimore and surrounding counties. Some traveled from as far as 75
miles to participate. This year, 48 students are participating. The
goal is to gradually expand to 200 youngsters from kindergartenthrough
12th grade, grouped into classes of 10 to 12 students.
   Diversity is a priority. There are wealthy students and poor
students, blacks and whites, Hispanics and Asians, kids from both
urban and rural backgrounds. The students are not necessarily
gifted.
   Tuition is $200 a year but scholarships are offered to eligible
students unable to pay. The center has a $100,000 state grant and a
federal grant that varies each year but was approved for $100,000
this year.
   On a recent Saturday, the fourth and fifth graders worked in
teams - ``pairs and squares'' - to solve problems and make
predictions. Teacher Mary Ellen Beaty-O'Ferrall coached the groups
through the frustrating moments that came when each person's
opinion had to be repeated and considered.
   The sixth and seventh graders had to overcome their impatience
to get done with the outside examination of the coconut and to
smash it to get at the insides. They also took a lot of time
discussing how best to open it up.
   ``I will NEVER think of a coconut the same way again,'' declared
12-year-old Tatiana Bareis.
   Worsham said the most critical issue facing educators today is
students' lack of adequate thinking skills to solve problems or
make decisions.
   Although research has shown that nearly all students beyond the
age of 12 should be able to reason at the formal operational level,
less than 40 percent of high school graduates are able to
demonstrate higher-level thinking skills.
   At the center, active, cooperative learning is stressed.
Students are encouraged to reflect on their own thinking and to
learn to manage how they think.
   ``I like being able to teach things that don't necessarily fall
under the category of a particular discipline,'' said Payne, who
works for Howard County public schools. ``I like most being able to
create our own curriculum. To have that flexibility is really a
treat.''
   Duff, an instructional specialist in health and science for
Baltimore City Public Schools, said she also enjoys writing
curriculum and was tickled about the success of the coconut
curriculum she developed.
   ``School ought to be fun and thinking ought to be fun,'' said
Duff. ``It's very exciting to me to think what our kids can do when
they become thoughtful and aware of themselves as thinkers. It
enhances their self-esteem. They feel competent. They're willing to
be critical - politely we hope - but still to think independently.
I've seen it happen with my students. It makes all the difference.'
   Anita Stockton, curriculum director, said parents receive
progress reports twice a year, but the focus is on the progression
and growth of the students.
   ``Nobody can fail,'' explained Stockton, a science specialist
for the Maryland State Department of Education. ``All of our
students make progress. Some make greater progress than others.''
   The students arrive at the Saturday School as early as 9:15 a.m.
to participate in enrichment activities 30 minutes before class.
There is the ``weird facts'' room where youngsters search through
books that describe unusual phenomena, the writing lab or the
computer rooms where 12 machines are available for students
interested in solving logic problems.
   The three-hour class sessions end with a ``debriefing'' period
where students analyze the day's activities while completing
specially designed charts.
   The teachers, part of a part-time staff that work only on
Saturdays, spend 30 minutes after class writing in journals during
a ``structured think time'' before joining together for their own
``debriefing and curriculum review.
   The drawback to the program?
   After a long pause, Sin Kei Yeung, 13, blurted, ``Why do you
have to come here so early? It's Saturday, you like to sleep
late.''

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neither Nadine Gordimer nor J.M. Coetzee spent
much time researching their new novels. They are South Africans,
and the setting of their books - the world of apartheid, police
raids and rebellion - is right in front of them.
   To write in South Africa means to have your subjects chosen for
you, Gordimer notes, the problems are simply too great to avoid.
But she and Coetzee differed greatly in recent interviews on what a
writer could, and should, do about them.
   It's a matter of personalities as well as philosophies, the
contrast between the outgoing, committed Gordimer and the shy, more
skeptical Coetzee, a debate on the power of art for art's sake
between two of South Africa's most acclaimed white writers.
   ``The creative act is not pure,'' Gordimer once wrote. ``History
evidences it. Ideology demands it. Society exacts it. ... One thing
is clear: Ours is a period when few can claim the absolute value of
a writer without reference to a context of responsibilities.''
   Just 5-foot-1, she has high cheekbones, playful eyes and a long,
thin nose. Her voice is small, her diction precise.
   The 67-year-old author works in the tradition of such
politically minded South African writers as Alan Paton and Athol
Fugard. Her characters are adventurers, travelers, participants -
people forced to make difficul choices between political
commitment and personal responsibilties.
   In her new novel, ``My Son's Story'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux,
$19.95), Sonny is a married black man who falls in love with a
fellow activist, a white woman.
   Hillela, the hero of her 1987 novel ``A Sport of Nature,''
leaves family and friends behind as she comes of age emotionally
and politically.``Burger's Daughter,'' banned for three months in
South Africa upon its release in 1979, details the struggles of the
daughter of the late South African Communist party leader.
   ``These are searing experiences,'' Gordimer said, ``and all
sorts of things can happen.
   ``We tend to look down on people who are not like us, especially
in revolutionary situations. I think sometimes you have people,
good people trying to do the right thing but not having the courage
to go far enough. On the other side, we have people who tried to
ignore what's going on.''
   While Gordimer writes of collaboration, Coetzee is obsessed with
solitude. He is quiet, with a gray goatee and soft eyes. He waits
several seconds before answering, his responses coming in full,
well-constructed sentences, as if the delay was necessary for
last-minute editing.
   His books are brief - usually under 200 pages - and intense; the
author knows it takes less time to prepare a meal if you turn up
the heat. In ``The Life and Times of Michael K,'' ``Waiting for the
Barbarians'' and others, he writes of innocents, outcasts and
guilt-ridden government officials, men and women doing their best
to duck under history or simply float above it.
   ``Age of Iron'' (Random House, $18.95) reads like a single,
sustained thought. The book is narrated by Mrs. Curren, a classics
professor dying of cancer. Her husband is dead, her daughter has
moved away and her closest companion is a homeless man she brings
in from the street.
   Tragedy pushes Gordimer's characters into action, but Coetzee's
people become more withdrawn. Mrs. Curren does not initiate events,
she reacts to them. The author writes of Mrs. Curren standing over
the bleeding body of her servant's son, who has been shot by
police:
   ``It was blood, nothing more, blood like yours and mine. Yet
never before had I seen anything so scarlet and so black. Perhaps
it was an effect of the skin, youthful, supple, velvet dark, over
which it ran; but on my hands it seemed both darker and more
glaring than blood ought to be. I stared at it, fascinated, afraid,
drawn into a veritable stupor of staring.''
   Says the 50-year-old Coetzee, ``Our history is such that all of
a sudden ordinary people are confronted with major decisions in a
way that ordinary people are usually not faced by. I think South
Africa in the past 40 years has been a place where people have been
faced with really huge, moral debts.''
   But what is the value of fiction in South Africa, a country
where political responsiblities make introspection seem
self-indulgent, almost treasonous? Gordimer, a member of the
African National Congress, believes fiction has subversive power,
that imagining a revolution can make it more likely to happen.
   In ``A Sport of Nature,'' she concludes with Hillela and others
attending a joyous ceremony proclaiming the birth of a new African
state. The book was written before the release of Nelson Mandela
and many other political prisoners.
   ``It's strange because when all of those prisoners came out in
October of last year, for the first time in many, many years there
was this enormous rally,'' Gordimer said. ``It was somehow a dress
rehearsal for what was in `Sport of Nature.' There were our leaders
parading around in this tremendous surge of exhilaration.''
   Coetzee is more cautious, wary of predicting any post-apartheid
utopia and unsure novels can keep up with current events. He
closely follows politics, but does not see fiction as the ideal way
to write about it.
   ``I don't think the novel is the most effective way to intervene
in the daily processes of political life,'' he said. ``Writing a
novel takes too long. Publishing a novel takes too long. Novels are
read by too few people. They don't have that direct kind of
involvement with political reality that newspapers have.''
   Gordimer sees fiction writers as the best kind of reporters,
combining technical skills with political and psychological
insight, taking an interest in the news of the day and conducting
exhaustive research of their characters' inner lives.
   ``The writers' powers of observation are more acute. The writers
of fiction often see in the behavior of people which way they're
probably going to go,'' she said. ``This applies to all societies.
If you live there all the time you can see what might happen, and
sometimes you're right.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Bathroom Graffiti Inspires K.T. Oslin</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The graffiti was printed neatly in black
ink on a bathroom stall in a cafe in Due West, S.C.
   ``I ain't never gonna love nobody but Cornell Crawford,'' it
declared.
   When K.T. Oslin read it, she chuckled. Then, pondering its
directness and determination, she knew she had a song. The result
is ``Cornell Crawford,'' one of Oslin's songs in her third country
music album, ``Love in a Small Town.''
   Cut after cut, the themes and emotions are from everyday,
ordinary life and hit special chords within the listener.
   It is her first LP in two years, a rather long hiatus for
country music. So this normally gutsy singer-songwriter confesses
to a touch of trepidation.
   ``If you don't put out an album every year, you can be dead
meat,'' the 48-year-old performer said in an interview as she
munched on bread and Brie.
   ``We'll see. But I don't think you become dead meat until you
are doing inferior work. Or mediocre work.''
   Based on her previous records, Oslin has little reason to worry.
Her albums, ``80's Ladies'' and ``This Woman,'' both sold more than
1 million copies.
   She won three Grammy awards during a meteoric rise in country
music. In 1988, she unseated Reba McEntire as the Country Music
Association's female vocalist of the year. McEntire had won the
honor four straight years.
   Now Oslin offers ``Love in a Small Town,'' an album weaving
songs of wry amusement, emotional strength, nostalgia and
loneliness.
   The LP's cut ``Come Next Monday'' is about a woman vowing to end
a relationship. ``Oo-Wee'' is about staying home from work and
frolicking. ``Mary and Willie'' is about two people with no love
interests in their life.
   ``Love Is Strange'' is Oslin's remake of a 1956 rhythm and blues
hit by Mickey &amp; Sylvia. Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton also recently
recorded it.
   Oslin's crooning ``... My sweet babe, you're the one'' has
almost as much feeling as an embrace.
   And ``Cornell Crawford,'' inspired by the writing on a toilet
wall, tells of dedication for the man who makes sparks fly.
   ``We all wish we had a Cornell Crawford,'' Oslin mused about the
song. ``I've been doing it in the live show for two years and it
gets some of the best response of anything. People are intrigued
about someone that emphatic. The sincerity of it struck me.''
   She wrote or co-wrote seven of the nine cuts and plays keyboard
on every song.
   Kay Toinette Oslin was born in Crossitt, Ark., but spent most of
her early years in Mobile, Ala. As a teen-ager, she settled in
Houston. Ending up in New York, she was a chorus girl in theatrical
productions and then turned to work as a studio backup vocalist and
ad jingle singer.
   She also showed a flair for songwriting. An aunt lent her $7,000
to finance a Nashville showcase performance, which caught the
attention of RCA Records. She signed an RCA recording contract in
1986 at a time when most record companies were looking for singers
almost half her age.
   Oslin became one of Nashville's most intriguing personalities,
launching a new career in her mid-40s and writing songs from the
perspective of a strong woman. Her hit singles included ``Do Ya,''
``Two Hearts,'' ``Hey Bobby,'' ``Didn't Expect It to Go Down This
Way'' and ``This Woman.''
   ``I was different,'' she said.
   She also was outspoken. She has said candidly that she hated
country music when she grew up.
   ``When I listened to country music in the '50s, it was almost
all males who seemed very old and sang about drinking and cheating
on their wives or girlfriends. A 15-year-old does not relate to
that,'' Oslin said.
   ``Fortunately, it has changed, and people who say today that
they don't like country music probably haven't listened to it.
   ``Some of it I like today, some of it I don't. I don't like the
real twangy, hard core, straight ahead, old style country music. I
like some of it, but on a steady diet, no.''
   Her current album is not her only new project. She just recorded
a duet with Barry Manilow, ``Baby It's Cold Outside,'' which will
be on his next album.
   Oslin also has received considerable attention for her music
video of ``Come Next Monday.'' In it, she portrays the bride of
Frankenstein.
   ``It has nothing at all to do with the song,'' she explained.
``I thought it was time to show that I had a sense of humor. My
videos have all been great but rather serious. We just went the
crazy route. It's hilarious.''

   ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' will carry the new
NC-17 rating when it is released by RCA-Columbia Pictures Home
Video on Dec. 12.
   The provocative comedy by Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar was
given an X rating by the ratings board of the Motion Picture
Association of America when it was released theatrically earlier
this year because of the film's sexual content. However, the X
rating was replaced by the new NC-17 (no one under 17 admitted) in
September when Philip Kaufman appealed the X-rating for his movie
``Henry &amp; June.''
   Most theaters refused to show movies with X ratings, regardless
of artistic merits, because they were associated with hard-core
pornography.
   Vidmark's ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover'' was the
first video to be released with the new rating when it hit stores
on Oct. 17. It had been slated for an R-rated version and an
unrated version.
   ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,'' Almodovar's seventh film, tells the
story of a former mental patient who kidnaps a pornographic film
star and ex-addict, who eventually falls in love with him.
   His ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' has grossed
nearly $30 million in worldwide sales and is the biggest box-office
hit in Spanish history.
   RCA-Columbia will release the video in VHS and Beta format at a
suggested retail price of $89.95. It will have subtitles.
   In other video news, A-Vision Entertainment, Atlantic Records'
new home video subsidiary, will release ``Mandela in America'' on
Nov. 20.
   The video is a montage of the South African leader's journey
across the United States and has interviews with such celebrities
as Jane Fonda, Spike Lee, Sen. Edward Kennedy and New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo.

   ``Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' (Warner Home Video. $92.95. Rated
PG-13).
   
   A successful sequel usually requires strong and interesting
characters or unique and compelling situations. Or, the sequel
simply has to be better than the original.
   With ``Gremlins 2: The New Batch,'' the most exciting characters
aren't human, and the situation would be compelling and scary if it
weren't so silly. This time around, the mutant Mogwai trash a
computerized office building in New York, gulp down vials of
experimental genetic drugs and leave a trail of green slime,
garbage and confusion.
   Gizmo has been living peacefully with his keeper, Mr. Wing (Keye
Luke), the wise and mysterious man who first introduced the little
critter in ``Gremlins.'' Daniel Clamp, a send-up of Donald Trump,
is a greedy developer who wants Wing's little curiosity shop in
Chinatown so he can build yet another sprawling steel and cement
monstrosity. But Wing won't sell.
   When Wing dies, Clamp sends in the wrecker's ball. Gizmo flees,
only to be scooped up by one of Clamp's reseachers from the
company's genetics lab.
   Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) also works for Clamp. He's the
naive, trusting lad whose father gave him Gizmo as a cute present.
Billy's true love, Kate (Phoebe Cates), is a tour guide in the
building.
   Billy rescues Gizmo just as the deranged Dr. Catheter
(Christopher Lee) is about to dissect him. But Billy, who knows how
Mogwais can dangerously mutate, goes out to dinner with his pushy
boss, Marla, and stupidly leaves Gizmo alone in his desk drawer
telling the creature that someone will pick him up.
   Gizmo, of course, doesn't stay put. He gets splashed by water,
which triggers the birth of mutations who take things a step
further and become those obnoxious and evil little uglies who just
about did in Billy's hometown. This time, they take over Clamp
Center and threaten to take Manhattan.
   Clamp's empire is shredded - from his ``Microwave Marge'' TV
show to the genetics lab. The microwave is a campy allusion to the
original movie in which Billy's mom nuked a bad gremlin.
   There are other campy nuggets as well: Gizmo as Rambo; Clamp and
Marla (as in Marla Maples, Trump's amour); vampire bats and
Christopher Lee, one of cinema's most famous Count Draculas.
   Billy, Kate and their visiting neighbors from Kingston Falls put
an end to a gremlin takeover.
   Don't look for chills and thrills, though. The bad Mogwais are
more comic than evil. There's a hyper, bug-eyed critter, a
ruby-lipped vamp and an intellectual who plans to lead his brethern
to Broadway shows and the best restaurants in towns (gremlins love
to eat).
   ``Gremlins 2'' is big on frenzy and mess. It's also good for a
sincere laugh or two. But the uniqueness of the creatures is gone.
Even Gizmo is no longer precious, but simply ordinary.
   The ``Snow White'' scene in the original movie was priceless. So
was the constant ``yum-yum.'' The sequel has none of those quirky
inventions.
   The creature crew is to be commended for the special effects and
for the Mogwai manipulation. And the support cast adds a much
needed luster, especially Lee, Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph as Mr.
and Mrs. Futterman and Robert Prosky as Grandpa Fred, a TV
personality who is host of a late-night horror movie show.
   Cates and Galligan merely lend a bland sweetness.
   If it's a rainy Saturday, get this one for the kids - they'll
love it.

   The years between his landmark movie, ``Easy
Rider,'' and his recent return to film prominence were a waste,
says Dennis Hopper.
   ``The drugs and alcohol that I was involved with stopped me from
working, stopped me from being creative. The problem with being an
alcoholic and a drug addict is that you don't think it's happening.
You don't know that you're addicted and don't admit that you're
addicted. It's always somebody else's fault that you're not
working,'' he said.
   ``Those were wasted years. I've directed six movies now. I
should have directed 20. It's unfortunate, because all that was
ever important to me was the work. I justified my own addictions
because I was an `artist,' and all the great artists, of course,
were drug addicts and alcoholics. Because of that stupidity, I
don't yet have a body of work that I consider important.''
   Hopper is striving to make up for lost time. His sixth film as a
director, ``The Hot Spot,'' starring Don Johnson, has been released
to hot and cold reviews and so-so business.
   While not in the Scorsese-Spielberg-Pollack range of directors,
he has no trouble finding employment, particularly for
hard-textured works such as his sensation-causing ``Colors'' (which
was blamed for scattered theater violence) and the current film, a
study of sex and crime in a small Texas town.
   ``This is a departure for me,'' he said. ``I actually used a
novel by Charles Williams. You might say we were of like mind. He
wrote the book in 1951, it was published in 1952. Then in 1962, he
wrote a screenplay with Nona Tyson; it was intended for Robert
Mitchum.
   ``I found that script and updated it to now. It's about an
amoral drifter (Johnson) who comes to a small town in Texas and
sells cars. ... It's a throwback to the film-noir dark movie, a
pulp novel. It's fun. I like it.''
   Johnson finds himself caught between two women, an oversexed
schemer (Virginia Madsen) and an innocent young beauty (Jennifer
Connelly) who is also manipulative. He also gets involved in
bankrobbing, blackmail and murder - ``all the good stuff.''
   Hopper considered other stars before deciding on Johnson, late
of ``Miami Vice.''
   ``I edited the movie for a year, and now I can't imagine anyone
else playing the role,'' said the director. ``People should really
look at him as a force to be dealt with in movies. He could be a
major star. There's a place there for him.''
   Hopper found Madsen while watching television via a satellite
dish during the filming of ``Flashback,'' in which he acted but did
not direct. He saw her as a throwback to Lana Turner, perfect for
the femme fatale role. He remembered Connelly from her role as a
12-year-old ballet dancer in ``Once Upon a Time in America.'' He
considers her ``more beautiful than Elizabeth Taylor and a better
actress.''
   Hopper talked about the notices for ``The Hot Spot'' and said:
``It's getting some good stuff and some bad stuff. But I think that
runs with the territory. It's a hot movie. But then, I've always
gotten widely divergent reviews, starting with `Easy Rider.'
`Colors,' `Out of the Blue,' also. It sort of follows me around
like a pet snake.''
   Nothing in Hopper's background provided any hint of his later
notoriety. He was born in Kansas in 1936 and spent much of his
youth on his grandparents' farm five miles from Dodge City. His
parents moved to San Diego, where Hopper won a scholarship to the
Old Globe theater. A taste of Shakespeare emboldened him to try
Hollywood, and he landed a seven-year contract at Warner Bros.
   Hopper appeared in some impressive films: ``Rebel Without a
Cause,'' ``Giant,'' ``True Grit'' and ``The Sons of Katie Elder.''
After a few low-budget biker films with Peter Fonda, the pair
combined their forces in ``Easy Rider.'' The film's gritty realism
revolutionized the industry. Its success also contributed to
Hopper's 15-year tailspin.
   Hopper savors his new life: ``I'm married (to dancer Katherine
LaNasa, 31 years his junior), I have a new son, Henry Lee, born in
September. I have two daughters. The 17-year-old just entered
college; my 28-year-old is involved in film development here. I
couldn't be happier. The work is good, and I just want to keep
working. Those are the important things.''
   Hopper probably will never shed his reputation as a world-class
hellraiser of the '60s and '70s. Just recently a New York tabloid
captioned a photograph ``Bad boy actor-director Dennis Hopper ..
.''
   Is he a bad boy?
   ``No, I don't think so,'' said the filmmaker, who resembled a
stockbroker in his expensively tailored suit. ``Maybe a bad
gentleman.''
   He shrugged off such references to his past: ``I'm not rushing
to get out of it. ... Seems harmless enough, doesn't it?''

   General director Ardis Krainik is steering the
Lyric Opera of Chicago into the 21st century, and she feels the way
to reach the wild blue yonder is to stay in the black.
   Once again this year, the woman who told Luciano Pavarotti his
services were no longer needed in Chicago has come up with an
operatic marvel rarer than a superstar tenor. It's called solvency.
   ``We haven't had a deficit since 1981, and for the second year
in a row our entire season was sold out by opening night,'' Lyric
spokeswoman Susan Mathieson said. ``Our ticket sales will top $11
million. Our fund-raising goal for the year is $7.95 million, and
we're right on target for that, too.''
   The current eight-opera season at Lyric, which began Sept. 14,
is the first of a decade-long initiative Miss Krainik has dubbed
``Toward the 21st Century.'' It's a program meant to showcase
often-overlooked 20th century operatic works, reshape productions
of more traditional operas and - most importantly - point the way
to the future.
   That future, as Miss Krainik sees it, is ``our own, unique
American opera, not just a hashed-over European art form.''
   Chicago's first taste of what such opera might be came Oct. 27,
when Lyric presented its first production of Minnesota composer
Dominick Argento's 1976 work, ``The Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe.''
   Although Argento's hallucinatory opera had been performed
before, both in the United States and Europe, it had never received
a full-scale production in a major house until Miss Krainik hired
Pulitzer Prize-winning director Frank Galati to realize it on the
Lyric stage.
   The opening night audience greeted ``Poe'' with wild applause
and multiple curtain calls - an enthusiastic response for a complex
tale filled with death, madness and suggestions of necrophilia.
   Appropriately, ``Poe'' was still running over Halloween, and the
timing reflects the canny Krainik strategy that has sold out the
3,564-seat Civic Opera House for every performance in recent years.
That strategy mixes innovation, superstar vehicles and old
favorites.
   The 1990 season began with soprano Jessye Norman's Chicago
debut, which came in a work so old it was new - Gluck's 1767
``Alceste.'' The 18th century music was juxtaposed against Robert
Wilson's ultramodern set designs and costumes, the first production
he had done for an American opera house.
   ``Alceste'' caused grumbling among some audience members, who
complained of the lack of English-language supertitles that have
become standard under Miss Krainick's management.
   All other Lyric productions this season have supertitles,
including ``Poe,'' which is sung in English.
   After ``Alceste,'' Lyric's season moved to the mid-19th century
sumptuousness of Tchaikovsky's ``Eugene Onegin'' and on into the
early 20th century with Puccini's ``Girl of The Golden West.'' The
Puccini work gave tenor Placido Domingo a chance to revel in the
spaghetti Western role of ``Johnson di Sacramento'' and to romance
the keeper of the Polka Saloon.
   Then came ``Poe,'' complete with premature burial, a pendulum
and a Masque of the Red Death.
   ``Red's not a color we like around here, financially, but it's
fine for costumes,'' Ms. Mathieson commented.
   The rest of Lyric's 1990-91 season is more traditional fare.
``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' ``Rigoletto'' and ``Carmen'' will span the
Thanksgiving-to-Christmas period, and a reworking of its acclaimed
1985-6 ``The Magic Flute'' will appear in January.
   Miss Krainik has not announced the 1991-2 portion of ``Toward
the 21st Century,'' but she says composer William Bolcom is
preparing ``McTeague,'' an operatic version of Frank Norris' 1899
naturalistic novel as the centerpiece of the 1992-3 season.
``McTeague'' is to be staged by film director Robert Altman, who
will be tackling the same material Erich Von Stroheim used for his
silent movie epic ``Greed.''
   The 1992-3 season also will feature the beginning of an even
more ambitious project, a remounting of Richard Wagner's monumental
``Ring'' cycle. Zubin Mehta is scheduled to conduct one of the four
``Ring'' operas each season until 1996. The entire cycle is to be
performed again in the spring of that year.
   Miss Krainik says world premieres of two other operas will occur
in the 1996-7 and 1999-2000 seasons - and both will be by American
composers.
   It's a major departure from the views of Miss Krainik's late
predecessor, Lyric founder Carol Fox, whose predilection for
European works and singers earned the Chicago company the nickname
of ``La Scala West.''
   Miss Fox's idea of a tribute to the U.S. Bicentennial was to
commission Polish composer Kryzystof Penderecki and British
playwright Christopher Fry to do an operatic version of John
Milton's ``Paradise Lost.'' That work had its premiere two years
late, in 1978, with sets designed to fit the stage of Milan's La
Scala, not Chicago.
   ``Paradise Lost'' cost a reported $2 million and added to the
sea of red ink that threatened to drown Lyric by 1980. In that
year, Lyric's board persuaded the ailing Miss Fox to step down
after 26 years and elevated Miss Krainik, who had been artistic
director since 1975.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Peter Wolf Pushes On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE M. PETERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two decades in the music business both
as a disc jockey and a performer have given Peter Wolf a certain
maturity. Sort of.
   ``I tend to wear longer socks now,'' he jokes. ``And I look both
ways before I cross the street.''
   But seriously, the former J. Geils Band frontman has been
struggling since the 1983 breakup of the group to strike out on his
own.
   His most-recent solo album, ``Up to No Good,'' was a critical
success but did not sell well. Now he's planning a tour to show
people he's still around.
   ``I haven't done it in eight years,'' Wolf said. ``The Beatles
were together and broke up in less time than that. In rock 'n'
roll, it's a millennium.''
   With J. Geils, Wolf's athletic antics onstage became as well
known as some of the band's songs, including ``Love Stinks'' and
``Centerfold.'' Then, at the height of the group's popularity, it
was announced that Wolf was leaving.
   Wolf said he's still bitter about the breakup, but added it
hasn't crushed his spirit.
   ``I became a soloist, really not by choice. But it was the only
way, a necessity, to keep on rock 'n' rollin' - because I loved the
band and I really would have liked to see the band stay together,''
he said.
   ``It was like someone who would have liked to see their marriage
stay together but there just wasn't any reason to hang in there.''
   Still, persistent rumors abound surrounding a J. Geils reunion,
especially every New Year's Eve, when the band used to play its
annual bash in Boston. Wolf is pessimistic about the prospects.
   ``The Geils band - we were a family, sort of like a bunch of
brothers sticking together through thick and thin. It just was hard
to try to keep that collective spirit,'' he said. ``People wonder
if the band is ever going to get back together, I really have no
set plans to do it. The only way I would do it is if I really felt
that kind of spirit could be regained. ''
   Recently, in a posh Boston hotel suite he took to meet the
press, Wolf looked unchanged from years of musical mayhem. The hair
may be shorter, but Wolf, 42, remains painfully thin, adorned with
eyeliner and dressed completely in black. His wit still is sharp.
   Wolf grew up in the Bronx. His father was an entertainer, his
mother a political activist, and the eclectic home life gave him
inspiration to be an artist. So he relocated to Boston in his early
20s to pursue painting.
   But art fell by the wayside when Wolf became the overnight disc
jockey at Boston's WBCN-FM and caught the music bug. It was there
that he met fellow musician Van Morrison.
   ``Van used to live in Cambridge and he used to listen, and
that's how we become friends. He used to come by and we ended up
doing gigs together,'' Wolf said. ``My band opened up for him and
we toured around New England together in station wagons.''
   In 1967, the J. Geils Band was born, taking its name from the
lead guitarist. Along the way there were moderate album sales, a
string of gigs opening for the Rolling Stones and the eventual
success of the 1982 album ``Freeze Frame,'' which sold 5 million
copies.
   But then came the unexpected breakup, with the band citing
``creative differences'' for the split.
   Wolf said he still prefers the group atmosphere, rather than
taking the risky solo route.
   ``I really enjoy being in a band. I enjoy the responsibility. I
enjoy sharing things. I enjoy the collaborative sense of it,'' he
said. ``It's a lot tougher being a soloist. There's a lot more
demands. All the focus is on one individual. I'm still not used to
that.''
   Wolf made two solo LP before ``Up to No Good.'' This time around
he decided to venture into unfamiliar territory for a rock 'n'
roller: Nashville.
   ``Many people think of it as just a country town - but there's a
lot of good rock 'n' rollers down there. And there's a lot of
studios.'' he said. ``So I thought it would be interesting to see
what it would be like to record outside of a big urban city like
New York or L.A. Once I started spending some time there I really
liked it.''
   He says the slogan on ``Up to No Good'' is a quote from a John
Lee Hooker song. ``If it's in you it's got to come out,'' sums up
his feeling about getting older, the business and his own
personality.
   ``To me, rock 'n' roll is infectious in the sense that - you
sometimes can't control it. It's something that's beyond the
senses,'' he said.
   ``You've got to really have that desire. As long as it's there,
you can keep on rocking.''
   Wolf was in Boston in October conducting interviews for
prospective band members. The tour, which does not have a firm
opening date, will likely take on small, intimate clubs. And
despite the years, Wolf said he's confident that on the tour he can
live up to the frantic stage persona he had with J. Geils.
   ``No one questions Frank Sinatra, who started out as a
bobby-socks idol, no one says, `Can he still be singing
``Witchcraft'' when he's 67?' Obviously he can because he's in his
70s and still doing concerts,'' Wolf said.
   But Wolf adds that he doesn't have plans to mellow.
   ``I don't think I'm going to be Perry Como in a sweater, holding
a pipe.''

<HEAD>Renewed Interest in Making Social Security Fairer to Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE SAKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ozzie and Harriet version of the American
family is nearly extinct, but the Social Security system designed
around it is much the same. As a result, women are the losers.
   Married working women usually earn no more Social Security
retirement than if they'd never worked a day. Most divorced women
get only half the benefits earned by their former husbands.
   Women who become widowed in their 50s face up to 10 years
without any death benefit checks.
   These inequities have been acknowledged since the mid-1970s, but
reforms went nowhere because the system went through a financial
crisis. Tax increases passed in the early 1980s have prompted
renewed calls for reform.
   Two House subcommittees are considering legislation. A task
force appointed by Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King is
working on its own bill.
   ``I think we have a responsibility to at least look at whether
we're serving the needs of families in this country in the 21st
century,'' King said in an interview at Social Security
headquarters in Baltimore.
   The Older Women's League, an advocacy group, explains the
problem in dollars.
   The average monthly Social Security retirement benefit for women
in 1989 was roughly three-quarters of that paid to men - $488,
compared to $639, according to the league.
   Compounding the problem, by 2030, only one in three women over
65 will be married, compared with 40 percent today.
   ``More and more women will be living in poverty,'' said Joan
Kurianski, director of the Older Women's League.
   Two factors put working women at a disadvantage. They usually
earn less than men and they often stop working to care for children
or elderly relatives.
   The system gives these women a difficult choice.
   They can base their Social Security check on their own earnings
or they can get a check equal to half their husband's benefits.
Because their earned benefit is usually lower than the 50 percent
spousal benefit, the years they worked and paid taxes go for
naught.
   Divorced women, unless they've earned high incomes themselves,
get only the 50 percent spousal benefit - and then only if they've
been married 10 years.
   Reform advocates also bemoan what they call the widow's gap - a
quirk in the system that can put widows in their 50s in poverty.
   While they are too old to begin most careers, Social Security
won't pay death benefits until age 60 because they don't have young
children. Faced with relatively paltry retirement checks, women
must make do in other ways.
   Lucille Leffall, 65, is a retired beautician in Baltimore who is
twice divorced and now gets $300 per month Social Security. She
works part time at a senior citizens center and depends on her
daughter and son-in-law for help.
   Without that, Leffall said, ``I would get married again, I guess
- if I could find the right person who would go along with my way
of thinking.''
   Mary Gray, 75, also of Baltimore, worked 14 years in a doughnut
shop and became widowed at 57. Her Social Security check now totals
$437. She lives in a rent-subsidized apartment, but still has to
juggle to meet expenses.
   ``I was raised during the Depression and you realized then that
sometimes you just didn't get what you wanted,'' she said.
   One proposal to equalize benefits between men and women is
called earnings sharing. The total lifetime wages of a husband and
wife are combined, then divided to compute each person's retirement
check.
   ``The principle is, marriage is an economic partnership and even
if I'm not in the paid labor force, I'm contributing to the
marriage,'' said Laurel Beeden, a researcher for the American
Association of Retired Persons.
   But earnings sharing cuts benefits to some people, such as
divorced men, so it's never gotten far in Congress. Rep. Mary Rose
Oakar, D-Ohio, has tried to solve these inequities with earnings
sharing legislation that prohibits anyone's benefits from dropping.
   Although this would drastically increase the cost, Oakar says
the Social Security Trust Fund can afford it.
   ``If you did the whole bill in one fell swoop it would cost in
the neighborhood of $30 billion (a year), but remember, as we speak
we have about $90 billion in the trust fund, and by the year 2000,
they say it will be up to about $1 trillion.''
   A less ambitious proposal by Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, would:
   - Allow women to take up to 10 years out of the work force to
care for children or relatives with no loss in retirement benefits.
   - Allow widows who are ineligible to receive benefits until age
60 to get them at 55.
   - Allow divorcing women to negotiate in court for part of their
husband's Social Security benefits.
   King, however, doubts the system can afford either plan. Her
task force is trying to reform the system without new spending or
taxes, a goal she says may be reached at the expense of some
people's benefits.

<HEAD>Red Barber a Highlight of NPR'S Friday Broadcast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENT KALLESTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans tune in weekly to
hear Walter ``Red'' Barber on National Public Radio, 24 years after
he signed off his final broadcast of a New York Yankees game.
   It has meant arising three hours earlier than normal since 1981,
when the live Friday segment became a fixture that includes
glimpses of history or personal insights.
   ``I don't enjoy getting up at 5:45 on Friday mornings, but I
enjoy doing it,'' he said. ``It's something I look forward to.''
   Although Barber usually discusses sports with NPR ``Morning
Edition'' host Bob Edwards, he is comfortable with nearly any
subject.
   ``Listeners like to know what the weather is in Tallahassee and
what's in bloom,'' he said. ``Basically it's what I want to say,
and it gives me pleasure. That goes back to radio in its beginning
days.''
   Barber, 82, also likes to bring listeners up to date on other
old-timers, often noting the death of former players, umpires or
journalists along with a personal comment on his association with
them.
   Barber's relationship with NPR began in December 1980 after the
death of Elston Howard, the Yankees' first black player. Since
Barber had broadcast Yankees games during most of Howard's career,
he was a natural.
   ``They asked for two or three minutes of my thoughts about
Howard,'' Barber said.
   A month later, NPR asked Barber if he was interested in a weekly
taped program. He insisted on a live format and refuses most
interview requests that aren't live.
   ``The thing about the show that is attractive is that it's
completely spontaneous,'' said Barber. ``As I sit there, the
pleasure I get is being myself.''
   The show, Edwards said, has become the most popular on ``Morning
Edition,'' generating thousands of letters from listeners.
   ``The biggest complaint we get about the bit (a 3{-minute
segment) is it's too short; Red can't really tell a long story,''
said Edwards. ``He is the star of the show, the network.''
   Last month, Barber and Edwards broadcast the show together for
the first time in a fund-raiser for the public station at Florida
State University, in Tallahassee.
   ``This will be a little easier for me because I'm a little hard
of hearing, and now I can read your lips,'' Barber told Edwards.
   Their Friday show on ``Morning Edition'' has always been through
a telephone hookup between Edwards at NPR's Washington studios and
Barber's home.
   ``We just fit,'' Barber said. ``He's a great professional
broadcaster. A wonderful interviewer and very sensitive. He doesn't
put his ego first.''
   Barber prepares for his weekly show with the diligence he
approached the thousands of baseball games he broadcast during the
heyday of radio.
   ``I don't want Bob to trip me up,'' said Barber.
   ``Bob makes it easy,'' Barber teased. ``He throws the big fat
pitches to me.''
   The weekly segment is unrehearsed and live.
   ``I have an idea of what I want to ask him,'' said Edwards, 43.
``I have no idea what kind of answers I'm going to get.''
   And Edwards marvels at Barber's wit.
   ``On opening day (baseball) we're doing a call-in show and
someone is on the line from Washington,'' relates Edwards.
   ``Hello, Washington. Washington? I guess they're gone,'' Edwards
said.
   ``You're right, Bob,'' Barber said immediately. ``They moved to
Minnesota in '61.''
   Barber finds television sometimes too enamored with sports,
often at the expense of news.
   He cited a weekend in early September when Soviet Prime Minister
Gorbachev and President Bush met in summit during the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   ``With all of this tremendous news, television only had tennis
and pro football,'' Barber said. ``I want somebody to tell me what
this means about our society.''
   Barber follows the fortunes of protege Vin Scully and Detroit
Tiger announcer Ernie Harwell, who moved into a big league job when
Barber fell ill during the 1947 season.
   Two years later, Barber hired Scully - longtime voice of the
Dodgers - right out of Fordham University. ``He's my boy,'' Barber
said proudly.
   Barber, who turned author, naturalist and homemaker in
retirement, seldom travels anymore so he can spend time with his
wife of 60 years, Lylah.
   ``If I had a so-called career, she made it possible because I'd
be gone six months of the year,'' he said. ``She raised our
daughter, ran the house and was lonely.''
   Daughter Sarah, a college professor, lives in New York City.
   Barber is delighted he and Lylah have enjoyed good health,
maintaining their one-level brick home in a lush, wooded
Tallahassee neighborhood.
   ``She and I have a life to ourselves now,'' said Barber. ``She
had a very lonely existence. It was a miserable existence.''
   Barber, who always disliked traveling, said he loves his
retirement routine.
   ``I like being at home,'' he said. ``And the Friday morning
broadcast is something to look forward to.''

<HEAD>Drug Abuse a Serious Problem Among Elderly People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The elderly and prescription drugs can be a
risky combination, and signs of aging may really be adverse drug
reactions, according to a study.
   If faulty prescribing is added to the catalog of drug abuse,
``then the greatest epidemic of drug abuse in America is among our
older people,'' the study, ``Worst Pills - Best Pills,'' concludes.
   Published two years ago by Public Citizen Health Research Group,
an enterprise organized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, the book
offers a guide to common prescription drugs, gives advice on how to
use them safely and recommends which drugs older people should
avoid.
   ``Some doctors and patients assume that what are actually
adverse drug reactions are simply signs of aging,'' the study says.
``As a result many serious adverse reactions are entirely
overlooked or not recognized until they have caused serious harm.''
   The drugs responsible for the most serious adverse reactions in
older adults are tranquilizers, sleeping pills and other drugs
intended to affect the mind; high blood pressure drugs and drugs
given for abnormal heart rhythms; and drugs used to treat
intestinal problems, the study said.
   More than 9 million adverse drug reactions occur each year in
older Americans, with an estimated 243,000 people 60 or over
hospitalized for such reactions in 1985, the study said.
   It said 32,000 older adults suffer hip fractures each year
``attributable to drug-induced falling,'' and 163,000 suffer from
mental impairment either caused or worsened by drugs.
   The study lists several reasons why older people are more prone
to adverse drug reactions, including lower weight, a smaller amount
of water and a larger proportion of fat than younger people.
   ``Therefore, the amount of drug per pound of body weight or per
pound of body water will often be much higher in an older adult
than it would be if the same amount of the drug were given to a
younger person,'' it said.
   And it said drugs that concentrate in fatty tissue may stay in
the body longer simply because there is more fat.
   Other factors: decreased ability of the liver to process drugs,
decreased ability of the kidneys to clear drugs out of the body and
increased sensitivity to many drugs.
   Taking over-the-counter drugs in addition to prescription drugs
also boosts the odds of an adverse reaction, it said.
   The study asserts that up to two-thirds of the prescriptions
filled by older adults each year fall into three categories:
   - Not needed because the problem is not one for which the drug
is a proper solution.
   - Needlessly dangerous because a less dangerous drug would give
the same benefit.
   - The right drug, but with a dose that is unnecessarily high,
causing extra risks without extra benefits.
   The study contends a host of illnesses, often attributed to old
age, actually can be drug induced.
   Its list includes: depression, hallucinations or psychoses,
involuntary twitches of the face, arms or legs, dizziness on
standing, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain,
bleeding or ulcers, constipation, diarrhea, difficulty urinating or
urinary incontinence.
   The study's advice: Take an inventory of the drugs you or your
elderly parents have taken over the last month, put samples in a
bag and take them to your doctor for analysis.
   The study includes a list, with detailed descriptions of
possible side effects, of 104 prescription drugs older adults
should not use.
   It also offers descriptions of 183 drugs it says are safer
alternatives.

<HEAD>`Mr. Potato': Nickname Grew From Early Seed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY JAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The potato disease that caused Europe's Great
Potato Famine in the 19th century was killing potatoes in Mexico in
1947, and the man who has become ``Mr. Potato'' went to seek a
solution.
   John Niederhauser, a plant pathologist who lives in Tucson,
recently received the $200,000 World Food Prize for helping develop
a blight-resistant potato.
   The award recognizes the achievements of individuals who improve
the world's food system, said founder Norman Borlaug, a 1970 Noble
Peace Prize winner. And Niederhauser's achievements ``have affected
countries from Mexico to Bangladesh,'' Borlaug said.
   Although he spent the first eight years of his life in
Washington state on his family's farm, Niederhauser, 73, said he
first became interested in potatoes while a student at Cornell
University. He said he used to select the best potatoes for farmers
while working summers as a potato inspector for the New York State
Seed Inspection Service.
   But it was not until he had gone to Mexico that he earned his
nickname, when a former president of the Rockefeller Foundation,
George Harrar, introduced ``Mr. Potato'' at a meeting, Niederhauser
said. ``It's kind of hung around since then,'' Niederhauser said.
   Nowadays he's ``retired,'' but his agenda remains full. ``I've
retired four times,'' he said.
   Niederhauser said he began developing a blight-resistant potato
after accepting a position with the Mexico-Rockefeller Foundation
Agricultural Program in 1947.
   He said he thought twice about leaving his teaching position at
Cornell, but ``I was attracted by the opportunity to work in a
country in the undeveloped world and help them produce more basic
food. It was different, but I felt we were doing something,'' he
said.
   Late-blight disease occurs when the late-blight fungus,
scientifically termed phythophthora incestans, destroys the
potato's foilage and eventually the potato itself, Niederhauser
said.
   The fungus originally is from Mexico, and is the main reason
U.S. farmers spray potatoes, a practice farmers in developing
countries can't afford, he said.
   The blight-resistant potato was 15 years in the making,
Niederhauser said. Mexico is the only place where blight-resistant,
wild potatoes can grow, and they were crossed with cultivated
potatoes to form an edible, blight-resistant potato that didn't
require spraying, he said.
   Niederhauser was one of four foundation members who worked with
the Mexican government, scientists and farmers. They were paid by
the foundation but worked as members of Mexico's Ministry of
Agriculture.
   ``My interest in potatoes gradually increased as I saw problems
we could help on together,'' he said.
   In Mexico, Niederhauser and colleagues helped raise annual
potato production from 134,000 metric tons when they arrived to
more than 1 million metric tons by 1982.
   Niederhauser's impact, however, is not limited to Mexico. He has
worked in Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Pakistan and Turkey with
scientists and farmers.
   Though he worked in Mexico for 35 years and raised four children
there with his wife, he has traveled around the world.
   ``I spent two years in the Soviet Union between high school and
college and worked on farms there,'' he said. He studied at the
agricultural academy in the Soviet Union in 1935-36.
   He travels around the world - recently he returned to Mexico to
help with an international potato project. Other interested
countries include Poland, the Netherlands and Peru.
   When he's not visiting other countries, he gives seminars and
assists with the Biosphere II project in Oracle, northeast of
Tucson.
   Biosphere II is a self-sufficient, enclosed miniature model of
Earth. Beginning in December, eight people will spend two years
studying ways to address pollution and mismanagement of natural
resources. The project also will be a prototype for living space.
The biospherians will be producing their own food, including
potatoes.

<HEAD>Company Prepares Families for an Older America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHIP BROWN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company has produced four videos to help
aging Americans and those who care for them sort through the
bewildering choices about insurance and health care.
   Jeanette Vaughan studied health care in college, but couldn't
think of a way to market her research. After seeing ``L.A. Law''
character Arnold Becker peddle a video of himself giving advice on
divorce, Ms. Vaughn plunged in.
   She made the videos ``All About Aging'' and created AgeView
Inc., which distributes them. The series sells for $195, and is
marketed to hospitals, nursing homes and health care agencies.
While the public can buy the series, Ms. Vaughan hopes agencies
will buy it to show consumers for free.
   By 2030, 21 percent of Amercans will be over 65. But Ms. Vaughan
said most of the country hasn't considered the idea of an older
America.
   ``The first ones feeling the impact are the women over 40 who
are working and also trying to take care of aging parents,'' said
Ms. Vaughan, 28
   Among the topics on the tapes are how to obtain Medicare,
Medicaid, private insurance and home health care; the psycho-social
views of aging and how to relate to older relatives; and details on
nutrition, safety and equipment use for elderly patients cared for
at home.
   Delores Moyer, executive director of Alverno Health Care Corp.,
based in Memphis, Tenn., is one of the agencies in 275 U.S. cities
that uses the tapes.
   ``We plan to start broadcasting the tapes across our
closed-circuit TV network in the hospitals so patients and families
can view the tapes while they are in the waiting room,'' said Ms.
Moyer, whose company operates nine hospitals.
   Ms. Vaughan said she plans to develop additional tapes. ``It's
not the answer to everything, but it points people in the right
direction,'' she said.

<HEAD>Do You Know How To Prepare a Will?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although estate planning involves more than
writing a will, it is one of the first - and most important - steps
in planning for the distribution of your estate.
   Still, 70 percent of Americans die without leaving a will,
allowing a state statute to make decisions on what is left to whom.
   To test your understanding of wills, complete the following
quiz, prepared by Emmertt G. McBroom, academic associate with the
College for Financial Planning. Select one answer for each
question.
   1. A will is a validly executed document that a) once executed,
cannot be changed by you during your lifetime without permission of
the court, b) conveys a present interest in property to your
beneficiaries at the time that it is executed, c) informs the court
and your heirs how you would like to have your property distributed
when you die, d) only b and c.
   2. To be legally valid in Colorado (laws vary from state to
state), your will must a) be a combination of printed material and
your handwriting, b) be witnessed by at least three relatives, c)
be acknowledged and signed by you in front of at least two
witnesses and a notary, d) be filed and recorded with the court.
   3. Your will legally can accomplish all except a) specify the
rules to be applied if you and your spouse die in a common accident
where the order of death cannot be determined, b) establish trusts
for your spouse or children, c) name the person that you want to
receive your interests in your joint tenancy with right of
survivorship property, d) direct which assets will be used to pay
taxes and administrative expenses.
   4. The person named in your will to administer the affairs of
your estate is called a a) beneficiary, b) trustee, c) guardian, d)
personal representative.
   5. In selecting the person to name as administrator of your
estate, all of the following are important considerations except a)
fairness and impartiality, b) low, or no, administrative fees, c)
sufficient time and willingness to serve as administrator, d) good
business judgment and experience.
   6. Your will should be reviewed and revised if a) there have
been major tax law changes, b) you no longer wish to include a
particular beneficiary, c) you marry, divorce, or have a child, d)
all of the above.
   7. In Colorado, the law requires that a decedent's will must be
lodged with the probate court or probate division of the district
court a) within 10 days of death, b) within 30 days of death, c)
within 90 days of death, d) never; there is no requirement to lodge
a will.
   8. Only the assets specifically described in your will must be
probated (distributed from the deceased to one or more
beneficiaries) through the courts. a) True b) False.
   9. To avoid having certain assets probated upon your death, you
could a) create and transfer the assets to a trust prior to your
death, b) place some other person on the title as a ``tenant in
common,'' c) have a will provision that transfers the assets to a
trust, d) retitle those assets held in ``joint tenancy with the
right of survivorship'' to name you as the sole owner.
   10. Only assets that must be probated are subject to federal
estate tax. a) True b) False.
   ---
   ANSWERS: 1. c; 2. c; 3. c; 4. d; 5. b; 6. d; 7. a; 8. b; 9. a;
10. b.
   ---
   Some final things to consider:
   - If you don't have a will, consider having one written as soon
as possible, and review it regularly - at least annually.
   - Keep a copy of your will in an easy-to-locate place. This does
not necessarily mean a safe deposit box, which may be sealed at
your death and access by beneficiaries denied. Send a copy to the
personal representative (executor or executrix).
   - In addition to your will, leave a letter of intent that
outlines specific, final arrangements, such as medical care or
funeral instructions. It can expedite the distribution of your
personal effects instead of waiting for the lengthy probate
process.

<HEAD>Your Vegetables Have a History, If You Only Look</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BRIA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A garden abounds in fascinating lore.
Each plant has a story, some highly dramatic or amusing, and
getting to know them adds a satisfying dimension to gardening.
   Take arugula, the salad green. The name suggests a recent
Mediterranean arrival. But digging in old books, I found that under
the name ``rocket'' it was a favorite of Queen Elizabeth I and came
to America with the Puritans.
   At various times, this herb was celebrated as a digestive aid, a
pain-killer, a deoderant, a freckle remover, a cough medicine, a
flavoring for preserved meats and, like many other innocent
edibles, an aphrodisiac.
   Over the years I've put together a modest little shelf of
histories containing such tidbits. I found one of my best books by
chance. Browsing in a bookstore, I glimpsed the title of a thick
paperback that was gathering dust near the floor. It was
``Sturtevant's Edible Plants of the World.''
   This 685-page volume (Dover Publications Inc., New York) turned
out to be a gold mine on the origins of vegetables and their
legends or superstitions. Boston-born Edward Lewis Sturtevant, a
19th century agriculturist, touches on 2,897 species, with comments
from 560 sources.
   He tells astonishing tales, like that of a group of ancient
Greek soldiers choosing slaughter in battle rather than escaping
through a field of fava beans they believed evil.
   Some books may be out of print, but you can get them at your
library or through inter-library loans. With luck you may find some
in second-hand bookstores to add to your collection.
   The National Geographic Society steered me to a store that had
one of the few remaining copies of ``The World in Your Garden,''
published by the society in 1957. This is a superb volume
containing instructive and entertaining essays on where our plants
come from.
   One writer in the book, Victor R. Boswell, says he looked at a
friend's garden and told him, to his surprise, that the only truly
American vegetables he was growing were tomatoes, snap beans,
peppers, limas and potatoes.
   All the others in his garden were of foreign origin - onions,
radishes, lettuce, spinach, beets, chard, cabbage, broccoli,
collards, carrots, parsley, turnips, peas, asparagus, soybeans,
mustard and eggplant.
   What the colonists found in North America and what they brought
with them is beautifully told in Ann Leighton's ``Early American
Gardens'' (Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 1970), still available in
paperback from the University of Massachusetts Press.
   A captivating item in this book is the bill of sale listing the
seeds John Winthrop Jr. carried on a 1631 voyage to New England.
   Leighton's book profiles the culinary and medical uses of
individual plants in that era and contains rich quotations from
herbalists of antiquity, like the Greeks Galen and Dioscorides and
the Roman Pliny the Elder, and such early English writers as
Nicholas Culpepper, John Evelyn, John Josselyn, John Gerard and
John Parkinson.
   ``The Secrets of the Seed'' by Barbara Friedlander (Grossett and
Dunlap, New York, 1974) sparkles with references to quaint customs
of the past, such as a girl giving a turnip to a suitor to signify
the cold shoulder. And historical bits, like an 1893 ruling of the
U.S. Supreme Court that the tomato was a dinner table vegetable
rather than a fruit. An importer who wanted to avoid paying duty
argued it was a fruit, which biologically it is.
   A British writer, Alice M. Coats, does a good job profiling
flowers in ``Flowers and Their Histories'' (McGraw-Hill Book Co.,
1971). Want to know about petunias? Coats tells us, ``The first
recorded petunia was P. nyctaginiflora, a white, sweet-scented,
night-blooming flower which was discovered in Brazil in 1823 by a
French commission.'' It was named ``petunia'' because of its
resemblence to the tobacco plant known to the natives as ``petun.''
   A book I like to browse in is Harold McGee's ``On Food and
Cooking'' (Charles Scribner's and Sons, New York, 1984). McGee's
684-page volume ranges far and wide in history and science. On
fruits and vegetables, he deals, among many other things, with
tantalizing questions, such as why onions make us cry.
   Delving into the background of food can absorb one completely,
as witness Margaret Visser's 351-page ``Much Depends on Dinner''
(Grove Press, New York, 1984). If you want the lowdown on the
lettuce you're growing, look it up here. She has 37 pages on it.

<HEAD>Doctors Seek New Ways To Care for Elderly in Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors are trying to find out why some older
patients in hospitals get well physically but never seem to recover
emotionally.
   ``The illness gets better, but the patient gets worse,'' said
Robert M. Palmer, a geriatrician at University Hospitals of
Cleveland.
   Palmer and Dr. C. Seth Landefeld recently received a $485,000
grant from the John A. Hartford Foundation to study elderly
patients affected by ``dysfunctional syndrome.''
   The doctors said some patients who are hospitalized can no
longer perform simple tasks, such as walking, bathing and dressing,
when there seems to be no physical reason.
   Landefeld said up to 30 percent of patients over 75 lose some
ability.
   Part of the grant was used to remodel a hospital unit to
determine whether a change in atmosphere can reduce the incidence
of the syndrome. The 15-bed unit, which opened in July, represents
a departure in the way such patients are cared for, the doctors
said.
   Greater emphasis is placed on how well a patient is eating,
walking, sleeping and using the bathroom and on signs of
depression.
   The doctors plan to compare how well patients do in the new unit
with results from other hospital units.

<HEAD>At 65, He's Newest Prosecutor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sol Weinberg has the enthusiasm of a kid
just out of law school.
   Weinberg is practically just out of law school, but he's no kid.
   The Camp Hill resident, who recently became a Dauphin County
assistant district attorney, is 65.
   He retired as a lieutenant colonel after a 24-year Army career,
including combat in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Weinberg
remembers reading at 15 about Clarence Darrow, the celebrated
attorney of the ``Scopes Monkey Trial.''
   ``The seed was planted years ago and never left the back of my
mind,'' he said. Last year he became what officials at Dickinson
Law School believe is their oldest graduate.
   His new boss, District Attorney Richard A. Lewis, said
Weinberg's age wasn't really a consideration in his hiring for the
$24,000-a-year job.
   ``True, most of our attorneys are right out of law school and in
their mid to late 20s,'' said Lewis. ``There are some exceptions to
that rule, but very few. But in Sol's case, anybody who wants to be
a district attorney that bad deserves it.''
   ``I like it very much,'' Weinberg said. ``I'm just getting my
feet wet.''
   He has about 10 cases assigned to him so far - ``just
run-of-the-mill kinds of court cases.''
   Law school was tough and the hours long, and Weinberg said he
asked himself at times why he didn't just pack it in and go to the
golf course.

<HEAD>Curbs on `Medigap' Will Help Consumers, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Consumer's Union says the impact
of increased Medicare premiums and taxes will be offset by
meaningful new protection for those buying supplemental ``Medigap''
insurance.
   Since 1965, when Medicare was established, ``consumers have
complained bitterly about sharp sales practices, rip-off policies
and skyrocketing rates,'' said Gail Shearer, a Consumer's Union
executive.
   The Medigap private insurance market was intended to help fill
gaps in Medicare health insurance coverage for the elderly. But Ms.
Shearer said it has left consumers ``confused and overwhelmed.''
   ``They waste money on unnecessary coverage, cannot tell a good
policy from a bad one and often have no one to turn to except the
insurance agent for advice,'' she said.
   The Consumers Union said the new curbs on ``Medigap'' include:
   - Requirements that companies package insurance benefits in
similar fashion, allowing older people to compare policies.
   - Establishment of state and local counseling programs to help
the elderly make the best insurance coverage decisions.
   - Requirements that private insurance companies pay more in
benefits. Companies had been encouraged to pay out 60 percent on
premiums collected. Now they will be required to pay out 65
percent.
   - Forbidding the sale of duplicative and unnecessary policies.

<HEAD>New Tests Toward Preventing Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New tests for impaired balance in older people
may help discover a way to anticipate and prevent falls, one of the
chief hazards to the overall health of the elderly, researchers
report.
   The balance tests involve how far one can reach while standing.
   Researchers at Duke University and at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center at Durham, N.C., conclude that the
test may be useful not only for measuring balance but for detecting
change in balance over time and helping in the design of protective
environments for balance-impaired older people.
   Reporting in the November issue of The Journal of Gerontology,
Pamela W. Duncan of Duke's Center for the Study of Aging says using
the act of reaching as a measure is practical and can easily be
performed at home or in nursing homes.

   Trans World Airlines Inc. has proposed buying
Pan Am Corp. for $150 million in cash and $300 million in

   The proposal is contingent on Pan Am calling off its $400
million agreement to sell important U.S.-London routes to United

which also flies into London's Heathrow airport, stipulated that

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - More than half the securities fraud charges
against Charles H. Keating Jr. were jeopardized by a judge who said
they cannot stand as written.
   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito said Friday that in 20 of the 42
counts against the Arizona developer and three co-defendants, the
indictment appeared to be lacking. He said two other counts
violated the defendants' right to due process because they were too
vague.
   Keating, the former head of American Continental Corp., was
jailed for 33 days on a 42-count indictment. He posted a reduced
bond of $300,000 last month.

   Roger Frankel's golf game is deteriorating.
Gerald Munitz had hoped to take it easy and spend ore time with
his wife and six children.
   The economic downturn has breathed new life into what had been a
shunned speciality - bankruptcy law - and Frankel and Munitz are
part of the boom.
   Law schools report that more students are interested in learning
about bankruptcy, though some prefer to call it corporate
restructuring.
   ``Certainly, there is a feeling it's a much more stable part of
the profession right now,'' said June Thompson of Harvard law
school's career services office.
   The newfound interest in bankruptcy law is due, in part, to a
credit crunch among corporations and individuals that took part in
the wheeling and dealing and spend-now, pay-later economics of the
Reagan era.
   The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said the number of
bankruptcy petitions filed annually nationwide has doubled in the
past five years to more than 725,000. Corporate bankruptcies
comprise less than 10 percent of the total.
   Most involve individuals seeking a way out from under a mountain
of debt, often caused by running up credit card charges.
   Frankel, a bankruptcy lawyer for 20 years, said, ``I have never
seen it like this'' in the nation's capital.
   His five-day work week of the past is gone. Since last spring,
he's been on the job 10 hours to 12 hours a day, six days a week.
   ``My golf game is suffering. Seriously, I have young kids I'd
like to see grow up. It's difficult,'' he said.
   Munitz said it is the same in the nation's heartland. His
Chicago practice is taking up more and more of his time ``just at
the point in life when you're hoping to take things easier,'' he
said.
   Munitz, 57, and a father of six children ranging in age from 11
to 27, said he would like to see more of them and his wife than his
work permits.
   The sums of money also have changed since he started practicing.
``As a young lawyer, when someone owed a million dollars, that was
all the money in the world,'' he said. ``It's peanuts these days.
We're accustomed to dealing with a billion dollars in debt. The
numbers are mind-boggling.''
   The competition for bankruptcy experts has law firms scrambling
to hire them.
   ``There are a lot more bankruptcy lawyers, particularly among
young people who five or eight year ago turned their nose up at
this kind of thing,'' said Nathan Feinstein, a bankruptcy expert
here.
   Feinstein, who heads an American Bar Association committee on
bankruptcy law, said that in the early 1980s only a handful of the
nation's 200 largest law firms had a bankruptcy department.
   Today, nearly all of them have teams of bankruptcy attorneys.
Many have acquired bankruptcy ``boutiques,'' small firms of perhaps
a dozen or fewer lawyers who practice the specialty.
   The demand has become so great that bankruptcy attorneys have
been flooded with offers to switch firms, Feinstein said.
   ``You start worrying if you haven't been called by a headhunter
this week,'' he said.
   Job placement firms say the hunt for bankruptcy expertise is not
limited to the traditional financial centers, New York, Los Angeles
and Chicago.
   The nation's capital, for example, is a seller's market for
attorneys - due only in part to the state of the local economy.
   There have been a number of major bankruptcies in the
Washington, D.C., area, and a downturn in what once was considered
a recession-proof real estate market.
   The collapse of the National Bank of Washington alone has
spawned a cottage industry for lawyers.
   More than three-dozen lawyers showed up in a federal courtroom
here recently to handle a spate of cases arising from the bank's
demise.
   ``All I know is the bank lost, I lost and the lawyers won,''
said Luther M. Hodges, former chairman of the bank's parent
company.
   Some businesses go belly up in bankruptcy and sell off their
assets. But in most bankruptcy proceedings, the overextended
borrower engages in what is called restructuring or reorganization.
Creditors are paid a fraction of what they are owed as the debtor
is placed under strict court scrutiny.
   Ironically, bankruptcies do not necessarily jump when a
recession hits. The opposite may be true as lenders decide it's a
bad time to collect when the value of corporate assets is reduced.

   Combining anemic puns with relevant
statistics, Louis Rukeyser grins and winks his way into the homes
of 10 million television viewers every Friday.
   Since 1970, Rukeyser has demystified the jargon and gyrations of
the economy. His irreverant attitude toward the often-stuffy
subject has made his show, Wall Street Week, one of the most
popular half hours on public TV.
   A 20th anniversary program with some of the show's best guests
will air Friday from the popular Tavern On The Green restaurant in
New York. A one-hour retrospective will follow on next Monday.
   The rakish, white-haired Rukeyser is one of the most durable
television personalities on the air, rivaling veteran luminaries
such as Mr. Rogers, Johnny Carson and Julia Child.
   He is known for painful fits of prose. Once while answering a
viewer's letter on investing in a hairpiece manufacturer, Rukeyser
said, ``If all your money seems to be hair today and gone tomorrow,
we'll try to make it grow by giving you the bald facts on how to
get your investments toupee.''
   After a market slump, he considered changing the name of the
show to Wall Street Wake. He often consoles viewers by telling them
to remember that its only their money, not their life.
   ``We have in America a bad tendency that things have to be
either serious or fun,'' he said, before taping the show at
Maryland Public Television in suburban Baltimore. ``Whereas in real
life, this isn't true. The teachers we all remember in high school
and college were not the ones who put us to sleep. I don't think
any of us should apologize for not being dull.
   ``Nobody wants to come home on a Friday to be `educated.' First
you have to pull them into the tent.''
   Along the way, Rukeyser was dubbed by People magazine as the
only sex symbol of the ``dismal science'' of economics. The New
York Daily News identified him as the ``economic guru of the
industry.''
   ``Outside of the Wall Street Journal, Rukeyser has been a
pioneer in demonstrating the popular appeal of quality business
journalism,'' said Thomas Rosenstiel, a media cretic for the Los
Angeles Times. ``He is especially good at proving that this stuff
can be interesting and useful without being deadly dull.''
   Rukeyser, 57, appears each week with three panelists, chosen
from a pool of money managers and financial analysts, who question
the guest of the week, such as the chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or noted economist John Kenneth Galbraith.
   In addition, technical analysts, whom he calls elves, vote on a
weekly ``Elves Index'' that assesses the strength or weakness of
the economy.
   Rukeyser doesn't makes any predictions other than to say he is a
long-term bull. He constantly issues disclaimers on stock tips
offered by guests of the show. Nonetheless, their recommendations
often cause share prices to rise sharply the week after the show
airs.
   Ralph Acampora, head of Prudential-Bache Securities' technical
analysis division and one of Rukeyser's elves, credits him with
starting business coverage on TV.
   ``When I started with Prudential, I told them I wanted a big
chart room and a television,'' Acampora said. ``They asked me why I
wanted a TV, and I told them, `Mrs. O'Brien sitting at home has the
greatest information in the world.'''
   That mythical viewer is watching business news on Cable News
Network and Financial News Network ``and its all because of Lou,''
Acampora said.
   Rukeyser, a former foreign correspondent for ABC and The
(Baltimore) Sun, became the first economic commentator for a
network in 1968 with ABC. He moonlighted on the PBS show for three
years before leaving ABC, complaining about television coverage of
economics.
   He still maintains economics is the most poorly covered area of
American journalism.
   ``The prevailing view is that the subject of economics is too
dull and-or too complicated to hold an audience larger than the
capacity of your average telephone booth,'' he said. ``I think
that's nonsense. I think there is a hunger in the American public
for clear, believable, understandable, usable pocketbook
information.''
   Despite his bullish outlook, he concedes the economy is
currently looking bleak, but he's quick to remind anyone that he
doesn't invest for short-term profit.
   ``Punk, anemic, weak, getting weaker. The outlook for the next
few months is soggy at best,'' Rukeyser said. ``But even with
minimal policy changes we can be on our way again by 1992.''
   Rukeyser, who also writes a syndicated newspaper column,
lectures and has written two books, is known for being tough on his
panelists and guests. He continually pleads with them to speak in
English.
   ``Jargon is a very convenient shield for people not entirely
sure of what they are saying,'' he said.
   Rukeyser says he will continue doing the show as long as it is
fun, which it still is, and as long as his audience still wants
him.
   Or as he might put it: His stock may be maturing, but his
ratings are bullish and the dividends rewarding. So rally 'round
the tube in confidence the guru will keep your interest primed.

   Savings and loan executives gathering in
the luxury hotels atop Nob Hill for their 98th annual convention
represent a smaller, humbler and healthier group of businesses than
in years past.
   Fifteen months after enactment of President Bush's thrift
bailout program, many of the nation's troubled S&amp;Ls are gone -
closed, sold to new owners with government assistance, or placed
under the management of federal regulators.
   This year's convention of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, which began Sunday, will be attended by executives
from the ``healthiest of the healthy'' - about 600 of the remaining
2,900 S&amp;Ls, according James Grohl, senior vice president of the
trade association.
   On average, they hold tangible capital equal to 4.3 percent of
their assets - nearly half again as much as required under the
reforms of last year's S&amp;L law, Grohl said.
   Capital is a key measure of financial health. It is the
investment of an institution's owner, which serves as a cushion to
absorb loss.
   The emphasis on the survivors is evident in the league's
changing leadership. Donald Shackelford, chairman of State Savings
Bank in Columbus, Ohio, will be installed as the group's new
chairman, the top elective office in the organization.
   Shackelford replaces Kenneth D. Seaton, chairman of D&amp;N Savings
Bank, Hancock, Mich., and is vaulting over the head of Robert B.
O'Brien, chairman of Carteret Savings Bank, Morristown, N.J., who
will serve as league vice chairman for a second year.
   State Savings Bank's tangible capital is 6.5 percent of its
assets, placing it among the top 11 percent of institutions,
according to Sheshunoff Information Services, an Austin, Texas,
consulting firm.
   In contrast, D&amp;N has been forced to lay off employees and cut
its dividend. Carteret's holding company, AmBase Corp., is laden
with debt and losing money.
   ``The incoming guy is symbolic. He's Mr. Goodthrift,'' said
Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of America, a trade group representing smaller,
community-based banks.
   ``The leadership has to come from those that are strong, those
that are successful and those that will survive,'' League President
Frederick L. Webber said. ``Catering to the lowest common
denominator ... cannot be the case.''
   The league was once one of the nation's most powerful lobbying
groups. But its power has shrunk along with the industry it
represents. This year, 2,978 S&amp;L executives and their spouses,
league staff members, journalists and others are expected to attend
the convention, down from 3,862 in 1989 and 5,500 in 1988.
   The surviving thrift officials are left pondering how to regain
even a portion of their former clout and their good name.
   ``They're lepers. They know it and they're unhappy about it,''
said financial institution analyst Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va.
   President Reagan visited the convention in 1982; George Bush did
the same in 1985 as vice president. In other years the convention
attracted, at the very least, a Cabinet secretary or congressional
committee chairman.
   This year, not one member of Congress is scheduled to appear.
   At least three House incumbents with ties to the S&amp;L industry
were unseated last week: Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., accused by his
opponent of having a pro-S&amp;L voting record; Rep. Charles Pashayan,
R-Calif., who interceded with regulators on behalf of Lincoln
Savings and Loan owner Charles Keating, and Rep. Denny Smith,
R-Ore., who sat on the board of a local S&amp;L.
   Convention headliners this year are Housing and Urban
Development Undersecretary Alfred DelliBovi and two Treasury
Department officials - Office of Thrift Supervision Director
Timothy Ryan and Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, a bank
regulator.
   The league's record of success in Washington has been mixed this
year. It successfully persuaded the Office of Thrift Supervision to
relax limits on the dividends struggling but solvent thrifts may
pay stockholders and to increase the size of the loans healthy
thrifts may make to one borrower.
   But its drive to get Congress to dilute rules forcing the
industry to concentrate 70 percent of its assets on housing went
nowhere.
   The league also hasn't persuaded the thrift office to allow its
members to convert to state savings banks, which operate with fewer
restrictions on their lending.
   Next year one of the group's goals will be to prevent Congress
from saddling it with more of the S&amp;L bailout cost. Another is to
keep federal deposit insurance from being dramatically scaled back.

<HEAD>After Gulf Crisis, Analysts Envision Oil Glut</HEAD>

   Once the Persian Gulf crisis is over, the world
will find itself flooded with oil as nations start arguing over how
much crude each should pump, experts believe.
   OPEC nations that stepped up production to offset the loss of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude will be caught in a double whammy as prices
come crashing down and the previously boycotted oil pushes its way
into the market. The producers will have a tough time trying to
agree on who should cut back and by how much, analysts say.
   ``That's inevitable, and it may be very difficult for them to
do, because when the crisis ends, the 11 OPEC countries other than
Iraq and Kuwait will already be producing more oil than the world
needs from all of OPEC,'' said Philip Dodge, an oil analyst with
Nomura Securities International Inc.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August, the international
embargo of their oil created a shortfall of about 4 million barrels
of crude a day.
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela immediately began pushing for higher
production levels to erase the deficit. OPEC oil ministers
eventually agreed to temporarily lift the cartel's quotas.
   Within weeks, the combination of more oil and less demand had
virtually erased the shortfall.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest exporter, says it plans to
keep pumping more.
   Since the crisis began, Saudi production has gone up about 57
percent, from around 5.2 million barrels a day to around 8.2
million barrels a day. The Saudis hope to bring production to 8.5
million barrels a day in the near future, and they want to raise
capacity to a potential level of 10 million barrels a day within
the next two years.
   It remains unclear whether a war in the Gulf would damage any
Middle East production facilities or how long it would take to
repair any damage. The Iran-Iraq war showed it is hard to stop the
flow of oil through repeated bombings, although experts agree that
Iraqi troops might be able to cause greater damage to Kuwaiti
facilities by blowing them up with explosives placed right at the
wellhead.
   Regardless of any damage or its longevity, the oil markets will
eventually feel the glut as Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude gets back in.
   Once that happens, the nations that increased their production
during the crisis will probably be reluctant to cut back,
particularly since their oil will bring far less money per barrel.
   ``All the OPEC producers are going to be at higher levels than
they were before the invasion,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior
oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``Other members are
probably going to be reluctant to cut back on production. They'll
have to adjust the quotas and who's going to be able to produce
what, and that sort of thing.''
   It won't be easy, and some in the industry believe the strains
on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will be great.
   Dodge said he thinks Venezuela might even weaken its ties to the
Arab oil producers and try to align itself more closely with
consuming nations.
   ``I would say for all intents and purposes, Venezuela's out of
OPEC,'' Dodge said. ``That's partly because the Arab members of
OPEC were cheating on them so much. I think Venezuela was the most
well-behaved of all the OPEC countries.''
   There have already been some small oversupply problems, as Saudi
Arabia and Iran have had trouble selling all the oil they are
pumping, because buyers are not interested in getting the entire
stock of certain less-desirable grades.
   The same thing happened when the Bush administration decided to
sell 5 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
an effort to bring down spiraling prices. Some 800,000 barrels of
an inferior grade did not have a single bidder, but the war-induced
high price of oil did not budge on such evidence of strong supply.

<TEXT>
   The new owners of Argentina's
dilapidated telephone system face a huge task as they try to reform
a business that has been run down during 42 years of state
ownership.
   The Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones was once one of the
best systems on the continent, but it is now in a state of
disarray.
   When it rains, lines go dead. On sunny days, calls dialed
correctly often ring the wrong number, or get crossed so that
several voices are heard. FAX and computer tramsmissions break off
because of the weak quality of the lines.
   As many as 500,000 lines - one of every seven - may be out of
service at any moment. Repairs can take months.
   Regional circuits are so crowded that during the business day it
is difficult to call the provinces from the capital. Telephone
books are years out of date, except for those in the capital.
Services like call forwarding and speed dialing don't exist.
   ``There is a lot to do,'' said Jan Jacques Damlamian, the
industrial director of France Telecom, which owns France Cables and
Radio and has become a partial owner of the Argentine system, known
as ENTel.
   On Thursday, a group of investors led by the Spanish phone
company Telefonica and New York-based Citibank bought a 60 percent
share of ENTel's southern half, a system of 1.5 million lines that
stretch from Buenos Aires west to the Andes and south through
Patagonia to Tierra del Fuego.
   Another group led by the Italian and French phone companies STET
and Cables and Radio, respectively, and New York-based J.P. Morgan
bank, bought ENTel's northern half - 1.6 million lines from Buenos
Aires west to Chile and north to Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil and
Uruguay.
   The privatization, with a value of about $1.34 billion, is one
of the largest in Latin American history.
   Despite the sorry state of the system, the new owners are
confident they can turn things around and start turning a profit.
   One way to achieve savings will probably be cuts in the ENTel
staff of 43,000, about one person for every 72 lines. Telefonica
manages to get by with one worker for every 186 lines.
   ``We're not the little sisters of the poor. We're here to make
money,'' Telefonica president Candido Velasquez told the newspaper
La Nacion.
   Rates were raised drastically in the months leading up to the
sale. They will be kept high. So will installation charges. A new
phone line for a business may cost $2,500, Telefonica directors
said at a news conference.
   ``Good service costs more than bad service,'' Velasquez said.
   In the past, ENTel employees paid reduced rates for their
phones.
   ``In principle, I'm against that,'' Telefonica's director of
international business, Luis Martin de Bustamante, said.
   Costs will also be brought down by modernizing outdated
equipment. Tens of thousands of lines that are out of service will
be repaired so they can be brought back on-line, and hundreds of
thousands of new lines will be installed.
   Also, the new owners will try to bolster business by getting
several hundred thousand people off of the lengthy waiting lists
for new phones. The penetration level of one phone for every 11
Argentines is relatively low by the standards of developed
countries.
   The new owners stress that change won't come overnight.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
and Japan's NEC Corp. have won a multimillion dollar contract to
install 700,000 new digital telephone lines on Java, Bali, Sulawesi
and Sumatra, a spokesman of the state-owned telecommunications
company said Monday.
   Muhammad Gempita said the government has chosen the American and
Japanese companies over three other bidders.
   The three other companies were Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan, Ericson
Australia Pty. of Australia and Alcatel NV of the Netherlands.
   The government last February put off awarding a contract for a
$300 million telecommunications project as none of the bidders
fully met its requirements with regard to funding and price.
   AT&amp;T and NEC had been the last companies in the contest until
the government's decision for a retendering.
   The announcement came after reports that the U.S. and the
Japanese governments were pressing the Indonesian government to
give the contract to bidders from their countries.
   The spokesman did not give many details on the contracts won by
the two bidders, but informed sources said the scope of the digital
telephone project has been changed extensively from its original
plan.
   The retendered contract originally called for the supply of only
350,000 line units for a price of $300 million.
   The scope of work now seemed to have been enlarged and the two
winners will now each supply 350,000 lines, of which 200,000 lines
will be imported and the other 150,000 lines will be made locally
in a joint venture with a local company.
   The value of the contract is still to be negotiated, the
spokesman said.
   The president director of the state-owned telecommunications
company, Cacu Sudarijanto, said the contracts will be signed with
both companies in January and they will be expected to complete
work in three years.

<HEAD>Union Rejects General Dynamics Contract, Agrees to One-Week
Extension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest labor union at General
Dynamics narrowly rejected the company's offer for a new three-year
contract Sunday, but did not vote to strike.
   Company officials and the 10,000-member International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreed to a
one-week extension of their current contract.
   The existing agreement, which covers an estimated 10,000
production and maintenance workers at GD's Fort Worth Division,
would have expired at 11:59 p.m. Sunday.
   With just hours to spare, union members voted 3,898 to 3,700 to
reject the company's final offer during a tense meeting at the
Tarrant County Convention Center.
   Instead of calling for a vote to strike, union leaders
recommended extending the deadline to midnight Nov. 18. The
extension was approved by a 5-to-1 majority.
   Union president Pat Lane said the IAM asked for the extra time
because GD obtained a temporary restraining order Friday that would
prohibit union members from picketing the company's Fort Worth
plant during rush hours when lines of cars are trying to get in and
out of the plant.
   Union attorney Rod Tanner said he plans to file a motion today
to dissolve the restraining order.
   Three main issues apparently separates the two sides: wage
increases and bonuses, GD's proposal that workers pay a portion of
health care premiums, and the company's practice of sending work
outside the plant to other suppliers.
   GD's best and final offer provided for general wage increases of
5.5 percent the first year and 3 percent the following two years of
the contract. The company also offered a $1,000 bonus payable Nov.
30 if union members ratified the contract.
   Both sides clearly would like to avoid a strike, with union
members facing an uncertain economy and GD pressed to meet Air
Force production schedules for its F-16 Fighting Falcon jet.
   Both sides still carry bitter memories of a 17-day strike in
1984 that led to an outbreak of violence at picket lines outside
the plant's main gate.

   A toughened Clean Air Act and the threat to oil
supplies poised by the Persian Gulf crisis are among the challenges
to be addressed by oil industry experts attending the American
Petroleum Institute's annual meeting here.
   About 1,200 industry executives and analysts are expected at the
three-day meeting that ends Tuesday.
   The passage in October of the new Clean Air Act prompted the
petroleum and auto industries to conduct a joint effort to develop
a new gasoline to meet the stricter standards for gasoline
emissions.
   Industry officials say the act has mandated a product for which
manufacturing technology does not exist, and may not exist when the
cleaner gasoline is required to be on the market.
   The Clean Air Act requires a 15 percent reduction in gas
emissions by 1995, and 25 percent by 2000.
   Because of the new standards, other fuels - such as ethanol -
may become more desirable. But low oil prices in the 1980s helped
weaken the effort to develop alternative fuels.
   Raymond G. Friend, vice president of High Plains Corp. of
Wichita, Kan., which produces ethanol, says ethanol's reputation as
damaging to autos is false and has been challenged in a federal
lawsuit against nine oil companies.
   ``The anti-ethanol campaign has diminished and demand is
building,'' he said.
   A number of oil companies, among them Amoco and Texaco, have
introduced reformulated, less-polluting gasolines.
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf has increased the relationship
between supply and environmental issues. The crisis has increased
oil industry interest in environmentally sensitive areas of the
United States now closed to drilling as possible new sources of
oil. They include the outer continental shelf, federal lands in the
lower 48 states and the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
   But Charles J. DiBona, president of the petroleum institute,
acknowledges that a lack of public trust stemming from the Exxon
Valdez oil spill in March 1989 reduces oil industry options.
   ``There is not a lot of recognition that we ought to address the
question of access to public lands (for oil exploration),'' DiBona
said recently. ``This (Persian Gulf) crisis has not caused people
to reassess opening the arctic refuge or offshore drilling.''
   DiBona says domestic exploration is an answer to U.S. dependence
on foreign oil supplies. The number of drilling rigs in the United
States has increased to 1,100 from about 900 since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But new drilling will be fighting the recent downward trend in
U.S. oil production from 3.7 billion gallons in 1985 to 3.3 billion
gallons in 1989.
   ``There is a real need to rethink the domestic exploration
strategy,'' said James M. Patterson, professor of marketing at
Indiana University in Bloomington. ``About 80 percent of the holes
ever drilled are in the lower 48 states, so there are probably no
great surprises here.''
   Patterson says oil companies must pursue oil in other areas
outside the Middle East if exploration is not allowed in the arctic
refuges. He said Mexico, despite its long history of opposition to
U.S. participation in its oil industry, may be willing to change.
   Venezuela, Canada, Romania and the Soviet Union may also present
opportunities, Patterson said.
   DiBona said the institute faces several legislative issues
including its continuing effort to open the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge to Drilling.
   He said the industry is concerned about congressional
consideration of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act that
would regulate underground reinjection and storage and state-level
attempts to prevent large petroleum companies from operating their
own gasoline stations.

<HEAD>Report Says Saturn Will Add 7 Models by 1994</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary is
planning to produce 10 models by 1994 and possibly expand its
current one-plant operation, a trade journal said today.
   Saturn Corp. sent three models of cars - single- and twin-cam
sedans and a sporty coupe model - to showrooms Oct. 12.
   The Automotive News reported in today's editions that the
company would add a luxury sedan and coupe, a coupe convertible,
two station wagons and two two-door hatchbacks.
   At least two of those vehicles would be added in each of the
next three model years, the publication said.
   Saturn spokesman Mark Tanner refused to comment on the report
Sunday.
   ``We don't talk about future plans,'' he said.
   A Saturn dealership official told The Automotive News that
Saturn has tentative plans for a small pickup and a second plant or
plant expansion.
   The dealership official, who requested anonymity, told the
publication Saturn officials ``said they wanted to give us a
minivan and a small pickup, but they said they couldn't do that
before 1996 because they'd need to build another plant.''
   He also said a minivan is on the drawing board.
   Saturn's $2 billion Spring Hill, Tenn., plant can produce up to
240,000 vehicles annually. The Automotive News said production
there was scheduled to reach 303,000 by the 1993 model year and
360,000 the following model year.
   That likely would force Saturn to build a second plant or expand
the existing facility, it said.

   USX Corp. and the United Steelworkers union
have recessed talks without reaching an early contract settlement.
   USW chief negotiator Andrew ``Lefty'' Palm said Sunday the
company's proposal fell short on wages, on cost-of-living hikes for
retirees and on job security in the event USX sells its steel
division, as some analysts predict.
   ``The company is obviously disappointed that no agreement was
reached, but I remain optimistic that a competitive agreement in
the interests of all concerned parties will be reached before the
Feb. 1 expiration date,'' said Thomas W. Sterling, vice president
of employee relations for USX's steel division.
   Bargainers started talks Oct. 15 on a new contract for 18,000
USW members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Alabama,
Minnesota and California.
   Although the four-year contract runs for 10 more weeks, the
company and union had imposed a settlement deadline of Nov. 10. The
two sides met for four hours Saturday in Coraopolis, Pa., before
deciding to recess. No date was set for talks to resume.
   ``This union tried very hard to get an early agreement,'' Palm
said at a news conference.
   Palm said the company proposal would have restored wages to the
1982 level but did not provide for further increases. Steelworkers
have made wage concessions to USX for the past eight years.
   Complicating the negotiations was USX's recent announcement that
it plans to make its steel division a separate subsidiary,
prompting some analysts to predict the division will be sold.
   The union wants a contract that restores $1.30 an hour in
concessions plus offers compensation for the past 18 months, when
USX steelworkers were paid less than their counterparts at other
domestic steel makers.
   Palm said the company's offer was less generous than terms
accepted by USW members at LTV Steel Inc., Bethlehem Steel Inc.,
National Steel Inc., Armco Inc. and Inland Steel Inc.
   The current contract was reached after a six-month work stoppage
in 1986.

   Trans World Airlines Inc. wants to buy Pan Am
Corp., but only if Pan Am's deal to sell important routes to London
falls through, TWA chairman Carl Icahn said.
   Icahn has proposed offering about $150 million in cash and
securities with a face value of $300 million for the struggling
carrier.
   Although TWA is considered to be in better health than Pan Am,
both have been hurt by rising fuel prices since the Iraqi invasion
and fewer passengers since the economy started weakening.
   In a telephone interview late Sunday, Icahn said Pan Am Chairman
Thomas Plaskett had asked him to make an offer in case Pan Am's
talks with United Airlines parent UAL Corp. fall through.
   As part of a $400 million deal, Pan Am has agreed to sell key
routes between New York and London to UAL.
   Icahn, who sent his proposal in a letter to Plaskett Friday,
said his proposal would only be valid if the Pan Am-UAL route deal
was terminated. The letter emphasizes that TWA does not want to
disturb the arrangement with United, according to a source who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   If TWA buys Pan Am, duplicated routes like those to London's
Heathrow airport, would be sold, Pan Am said.
   Icahn's letter, which was dated and delivered late Friday,
proposed Pan Am shareholders receive $1 per share in cash and
securities with a face value of $2 per share. The securities,
either preferred stock or promissory notes, could bring different
market prices.
   Pan Am's stock was up 12{ cents at $1.75 early today on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Pan Am said in a statement it was still working to complete the
route sale to United, but that the deal could be called off if it
is not completed by Nov. 14.
   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United, would not comment on the
TWA proposal. Icahn's letter also proposed buying the Pan Am
Shuttle, which flies between Boston, New York and Washington, by
the end of the year. TWA's proposal to buy the rest of the company
is open through Nov. 16 and TWA would plan on completing the deal
by the end of March.
   The Wall Street Journal reported recently that Pan Am's pilots
might be willing to pay $150 million to $200 million for the
shuttle alone. Subtracting other elements of Pan Am's deal with
United, the London routes are valued at about $290 million.
   TWA and Pan Am are the only two U.S. airlines flying into
London's Heathrow airport. Other duplications are between the U.S.
and Paris and the U.S. and Rome.
   Pan Am last week announced that if it completed the route sale
to United it would turn much of its attention to Latin America and
bolster its Miami operations.
   Rising fuel prices since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has hurt many
airlines.
   TWA last month announced 430 layoffs from its workforce of
33,000 to cope with the rising jet fuel prices and the economic
downturn.
   TWA also said it would stop hiring and training new pilots and
flight attendants.
   TWA, headquartered in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., earned $103.4 million in
the second quarter of the year, but that included one-time gains
from the sales of assets totalling $160.2 million. In the second
quarter of 1989, the airline lost $4.4 million.
   Earlier this month, Pan Am announced it had lost $29.1 million,
or 19 cents per share, for the third quarter. In the same period a
year earlier the airline lost $18 million, or 12 cents a share.
   The airline cited rising jet fuel costs for the poor
performance.

<TEXT>
   Oklahoma led a list of several major oil
producing states reporting declines in the number of working oil
and gas rigs this past week, a new survey said Monday.
   The overall total of working rigs in the United States dropped
by 20 to 1,124 from the previous week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The decrease, attributed partly to bad weather, followed several
weeks of increases that had taken the total to its highest level
since Dec. 28, 1987. The count a year ago was 1,045, the
Houston-based toolmaker said. Last week, the count improved by 37
to 1,144.
   ``Part of that decline, good part of it, was the weather,'' said
Ike Kerridge, a vice president at Baker Hughes. ``Oklahoma lost 16
rigs and we identified 11 of those that cannot move because of wet
ground. Oklahoma had about four inches of rain last week.''
   Kerridge said some of the losses were offset by a ``good
increase in the offshore drilling rigs.''
   Of the total rigs running as of Monday, 109 were offshore, 26
were in inland waters and 989 were on land, the toolmaker reported.
   Baker Hughes has kept track of the rig count - a widely watched
index of drilling activity - since 1940. The count represents the
number of rigs actively exploring for oil, not those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Besides Oklahoma, other major oil producing states reporting rig
losses for the week include Pennsylvania, which dropped by eight;
Wyoming, down by five; California and Colorado, which each lost
two; and Kansas, New Mexico and Ohio, which each lost one.
   Among states reporting gains for the week are Louisiana, which
added eight; Texas, up by three; and Michigan and North Dakota,
which each increased its count by one rig.

   Grains and soybeans futures dipped at the outset
of trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, but soybeans and
wheat quickly rebounded.
   Soybean futures prices had fallen sharply Friday following an
Agriculture Department report after Thursday's close, which
indicated a larger supply of soybeans than many analysts expected.
   Grains, pressured by weak export business in the face of large
world supplies, followed soybeans' slide.
   But prices rebounded for soybeans and wheat after the opening
amid bargain-hunting and profit-taking.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.66} a bushel; corn
futures were } cent to \ cent lower with December at $2.30} a
bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with December at {1.17\ a
bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 2} cents higher with November
at $5.69{ a bushel.
   Wheat futures prices settled Friday 3{ cents to 2\ cents lower

   In early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle
futures were .05 cent to .32 cent higher with December at 78.62

November at 88.27 cents a pound; hogs were .40 cent to .90 cent

<TEXT>
   The president of the American Federation
of Teachers has resigned from the board of advisers that Whittle
Communications created in connection with its
commercially-sponsored news program for teens in the classroom.
   AFT president Albert Shanker quit the board, contending a breach
of trust with Knoxville-based Whittle and its Channel One
television news program that is beamed to schools across the
country.
   ``When I agreed to serve on the Channel One Council of Advisers,
I made it clear in writing that my decision in no way constituted
an endorsement either of the program or of advertising in the
public schools,'' Shanker wrote Whittle chairman Chris Whittle.
   ``In fact, I explicitly stated my role would be that of a `watch
dog,''' he wrote in the Oct. 12 letter.
   ``I should have realized that being on the council would
inevitably lead to the perception that I endorsed Channel One,'' he
wrote. ``But it was not until I saw my name and picture being used
in Channel One promotional materials that this point was driven
home.''
   Shanker said his resignation was effective immediately and asked
Whittle to stop using his name and picture in promotional
materials.
   The AFT is formally opposed to TV commercials in the classroom
and denounces the lack of funding that compels schools to accept
commercials in return for TV equipment, such as Whittle offers with
Channel One.
   Schools that sign up to show the Channel One news show to their
students are loaned satellite dishes and television monitors for
every classroom. They get to keep the equipmnet only as long as
they show the 12-minutes news show with its ads every school day.
   Whittle spokesman Tom Ingram said Chris Whittle and Shanker had
talked about the resignation.
   ``He was not able to attend any of the meetings, and the reason
he joined was to have input,'' Ingram said. ``Being unable to
attend, he was unable to have input.''
   As for the promotion, Ingram said, ``We are going to go ahead
and continue to use the material, and he understands.''

   Newmont Australia Ltd. has won control

its 54.9 percent stake in the gold mining concern.
   Under terms of the stock swap, BHP will continue to own 23
percent of the new company which will be Australia's largest pure
gold producer.
   BHP said in a statement Monday that the new company would be
among the top 15 gold companies in the world with anticipated 1991
production of about 750,000 ounces.
   ``BHP has undertaken a broad program of due dilligence covering
all major technical, legal and financial matters and is satisfied
that the merger will provide the opportunity to strengthen its
current investment in the Australian gold industry,'' BHP said.
   Newmont launched the bid in September after taking court action
against a similar bid launched on it by Robert Champion de
Crespigny's Poseidon group.
   Poseidon later abandoned its bid for Newmont, but retains a 19.9
percent stake in the company, which would be equivalent to about 12
percent of a merged Newmont-BHP Gold group.

<HEAD>Increased Fuel Costs Force Northwest Airlines Earnings Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines said Monday that higher
fuel costs associated with the Middle East crisis caused a 47
percent drop in its third-quarter earnings and will result in a
fourth-quarter loss.
   The nation's fourth largest airline reported net income of $91
million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from $134 million for
the same period in 1989.
   Operating revenues grew from $1.8 billion during the third
quarter in 1989 to $2 billion to the same quarter this year, the
airline said.
   Northwest said its fuel expense jumped 30.5 percent from last
year's third quarter, from $259 million to $338 million. The
escalation in prices followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We anticipate that continued high fuel expenses for the
remainder of the year will result in a fourth-quarter net loss,''
said John Dasburg, Northwest president and chief executive officer.
   Northwest said it has adopted a number of measures to deal with
its soaring fuel bill, including fare increases, flight schedule
reduction, deferral of non-essential expenses, and a ceiling on the
number of people it employs.
   Northwest said operating expenses increased from $1.6 billion to
$1.9 billion in the third quarter, while operating income decreased
from $181 million to $116 million. Northwest's cash flow from
operations was $195 million, compared with $174 million from the
same quarter a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Northwest posted net earnings
of $111 million, down from $240 million for the first nine months
of 1989.
   Operating revenues for the first nine months were $5.4 billion,
up from $4.9 billion, and operating expenses grew from $4.6 billion
to $5.3 billion. Operating income for the three quarters was $90
million, compared to $297 million in 1989.

<HEAD>Dollar Weakens in Europe, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar ended mostly lower today in thin
European trading. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the dollar moved lower partly because of some
expectation of further cuts in U.S. interest rates, but trading
worldwide was slim due to holidays in Japan and the United States.
   In Tokyo, the dollar traded at 130.50 yen, unchanged from
Friday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 128.80 yen. In New
York at midday, the dollar was quoted at 129.68 yen.
   In London, the British pound traded at $1.9627, compared with
$1.9670 late Friday. In New York at midday, sterling was quoted at
$1.9660.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.4805 German marks, down from 1.4875; 1.2500 Swiss francs, up from
1.2495; 4.9755 French francs, down from 4.9940; 1.6700 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.6775; 1,113.25 Italian lire, down from
1,119.50; 1,1665 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1698.
   Other midday quotes for the dollar in New York included: 1.4875
German marks, 1.2495 Swiss francs, 1.1678 Canadian dollars and
1,121.08 Italian lire.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $382.25 a troy ounce,
from $384.75 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $381.00, down from
$385.80 bid late Friday.
   In Hong Kong, gold dropped 97 cents an ounce to close at $383.61
on Monday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.24 a
troy ounce, down from $4.25 bid late Friday.

   Several competitors are trying to break Intel
Corp.'s lucrative monopoly over a microprocessor that increasingly
is the chip of choice for IBM personal computers and compatible
models.
   Intel's 80386 microprocessor has been a runaway success,
bringing in about a billion dollars a year in revenue and some of
the highest profit margins the semiconductor industry has ever
seen, said Michael Slater, editor of the newsletter Microprocessor
Report.
   Microprocessors are fingernail-sized wafers of silicon
containing circuitry that acts as the brains of personal computers.
   One of the would-be interlopers, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.,
began giving private demonstrations Monday of its 386 clone at the
huge Comdex computer show here. AMD removed Intel's chips from
several personal computers and replaced them with its own version.
   ``There are no compatibility problems with it - it works,'' said
AMD spokesman David Frink. He said about 20 computer makers are
testing the chip or have already evaluated it.
   A public announcement of the AMD microprocessor awaits a
determination of its price and availability date, officials of the
semiconductor company said.
   AMD says it used a process called reverse engineering to devise
a chip that mimics the 386 but uses different circuitry. In fact,
AMD says its chip is better because it uses less power.
   Several other semiconductor companies also are working on 386
clones, industry analysts say.
   But Intel, one of the world's largest semiconductor companies,
is not sitting still while competitors try to chip away at its
blockbuster product. It is involved in a thicket of legal conflicts
with AMD, with which it once enjoyed a cooperative relationship.
   Intel has filed two lawsuits, one contending AMD has no right to
a crucial component of the 386 chip called microcode, and the
second charging that AMD would infringe on Intel's trademark if it
uses the 386 name to market its chip.
   On Friday, a federal judge denied Intel's request for an
injunction to block AMD from using the 386 name. But it was unclear
whether the ruling would give computer makers who use the AMD chip
the right to call them 386 machines.
   The microcode suit stems from a 1976 agreement in which Intel
granted AMD the right to the patents and microcode for Intel
microprocessors. Intel now claims AMD may only copy the microcode
for its own use, not to sell chips containing it.
   Microcode is a set of software instructions contained in a
memory device on each microprocessor. It tells the circuits how to
process data.
   AMD, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., will devise microcode of its
own to mimic Intel's if it loses the suit, Frink said.
   AMD also is involved in another legal battle with Intel that
could result in AMD gaining rights to make a carbon copy of the 386
chip. That dispute, now in abritration, stems from a 1982
technology-sharing agreement between the two companies.
   Intel claims AMD reneged on the agreement. AMD says it met the
terms of the pact and should be given access to the 386 chip, as
well as $500 million in damages.
   An arbitrator ruled last month that Intel did not act in good
faith in the dispute, but he delayed deciding whether AMD should
gain rights to the 386 chip until another phase of the proceeding,
which is scheduled to start this week.
   ``The lawyers are really doing well over Intel and AMD,'' said
Slater, the newsletter editor.
   Intel's 386 chip, introduced in 1985, is becoming the favored
microprocessor for International Business Machines Corp. personal
computers and clones. It is faster than the 286 chip it succeeded
but not as costly as Intel's top-of-the-line 486.
   Four companies, including AMD, make clones of the 286 chip under
license from Intel, said Intel spokeswoman Pam Pollace from the
company's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters.
   But no such licenses are planned for the 386 chip despite the
fact that Intel has been rationing its production to customers,
Pollace said. She said Intel expects to meet demand by year's end.
   Dataquest, a high-tech research firm, says 7.3 million personal
computers with the 386 chip and its lower-cost variant, the 386SX,
will be shipped this year.
   Dataquest projects that shipments of 386-based machines will
grow at a double-digit pace over the next four years, while those
of computers with the 286 will decline about 7 percent.

   The stock market rose sharply today, extending
Friday's rally on the strength of falling oil prices and hopes for
lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 44.80 points Friday,
climbed 41.84 to 2,530.45 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide

   The price of crude oil for December delivery dropped more than
$2 a barrel, to about $31.75 a barrel, in today's trading on the

   Beyond that immediate stimulus, analysts said traders were
encouraged by increasing talk of actions soon by the Federal
Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Recent economic evidence has spotlighted signs of economic
weakness, while providing some indications that inflationary
pressures might be easing.

<HEAD>Skeptical of Government Numbers and Budget Jargon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Should we believe the government when it says
the budget has been cut or the economy is still expanding?
   Private-sector economists, business people and others are
increasingly skeptical of government jargon and statistics.
   Most recently, their eyebrows were raised by the government's
figures for the third-quarter gross national product, which showed
growth running at an annual rate of 1.8 percent, confounding a vast
number of researchers who were convinced the report should have
shown the economy shrinking.
   Walter J. Williams of American Business Econometrics, a
Ridgewood, N.J., advisory firm that counts blue-chip corporations
as clients, declared flatly that the supposed expansion will be
revealed eventually as a contraction.
   Williams estimates that in reality the decline amounted to about
2 percent on an annual basis, and he expressed the personal opinion
that the numbers were manipulated to influence the November
elections.
   Economist E. Erich Heinemann was equally blunt, declaring the
report of accelerated economic growth ``spurious'' and ``phony as a
three-dollar bill.'' Referring to underlying assumptions, he said,
``the illogic is dazzling.''
   Such comments are becoming widespread, and involve not just the
accuracy of numbers but the intent of words as well. Economists and
business people, for example, are upset that Americans believe
Congress actually cut the budget.
   Among those angered by that interpretation are members of the
U.S. Business and Industrial Council, made up of the heads of
mainly small and medium-sized businesses, many of whom have had to
cut their own budgets.
   The council, a conservative group based in Washington, issued a
statement saying ``our member companies are increasingly frsutrated
by the jargon of deficit reduction.''
   The statement explained they ``cannot fathom the `current
services' approach to budgeting, which allows for automatic
increases in spending.'' The ``reduction,'' it says, allows for
$240 billion in new spending.
   It is the statistical communications, however, that seem to
receive the most criticism, and Williams asserts that some of the
distrust arises from the suspicions that economic numbers are
managed.
   For the past four years, Williams has questioned members of the
National Association of Business Economists on the credibility of
economic numbers, which in recent years have become more
prominently displayed in the media.
   The chief complaint that his fellow economists have, he said, is
that government agencies that produce statistics lack adequate
funding and staff. But fears of manipulation, especially in
election years, are growing, he ssaid.
   His survey in 1987 showed 15 percent of economist-respondents
thought the staticstic were doctored. In 1988, an election year,
the percentage rose to 33, dropped back to 15 in 1988 and soared to
39 in 1990, another election year.
   Williams said his surveys are ``blind,'' meaning respondents do
not sign. But in the most recent survey, held in Washington in
September, Williams said several government economists spoke to him
about their own doubts.
   The report of higher gross national product in the third quarter
was especially bewildering, since many economists had forecast in
advance that it would fall. Unconvinced, they now look for downward
revisions.
   Heinemann observes that the alleged pickup in GNP depended on an
assumption that inflation slowed last summer, but that ``anyone who
has gone to a supermarket or a gas station in the last few months
knows that is not true.''
   He points to inconsistencies: Industrial output was said to have
risen, but other statistics fail to coincide. ``What happened to
the goods? Did somebody buy them? Did they go into inventory? Were
they exported?''
   He said, ``The way the government tells the story, the answer is
none of the above.'' But, he added, ``Clearly these figures cannot
all be correct.''

<HEAD>Public Inquiry Accuses Occidental of Safety Lapses in Rig Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public inquiry into the Piper Alpha oil rig
disaster accused Occidental Petroleum Ltd. of unsafe practices in
the July 1988 explosion that killed 167 men.
   The inquiry published Monday also recommended that
responsibility for oil platform safety be transferred from
Britain's Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Executive.
   The report recommends a thorough overhaul of existing safety
practices regarding oil rigs and a tough new regime for oil and gas
companies that own and operate the rigs.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham said he passed the inquiry's
report on to Scotland's senior law officer to determine whether
Occidental, the Piper Alpha operator, should be prosecuted.
   The Piper Alpha disaster was the world's worst oil rig
explosion. The platform burst into flames when gas from ruptured
pipelines caught fire and the emergency systems on the rig failed
to operate.
   The smoke and flames were so intense that rescuing the men on
the rig by helicopter or lifeboat was impossible. The 62 survivors
reached the sea by rope and hoses and by jumping off the platform.
   ``At no stage was there a systematic attempt to lead men to
escape,'' the report said.
   The report was written by Scottish High Court Judge Lord Cullen,
who conducted the year-long inquiry into the disaster.
   ``The government is now acting to implement the recommendation
for a new regulatory system and to ensure that the lessons of this
terrible event are fully learnt and fully put into effect,'''
Wakeham said.
   Cullen said the inquiry found a number of areas ``in which the
laid-down procedure was not adhered to and unsafe practices were
followed.'' He also said Occidental was ``too easily satisfied''
the platform systems were operating correctly the night of the
disaster.
   He criticized Occidental for failing to provide proper emergency
training for its staff and not paying sufficient attention to the
threat of a major hazard.
   He said the energy department conducted inspections on Piper
Alpha that were ``superficial to the point of being of little use
as a test of safety.''
   Glenn Shurtz, president of the Occidental Petroleum Corp. unit,
rejected Cullen's criticisms, but pledged to do anything to ``make
the North Sea a safer place to work.''
   ``Lord Cullen's report and the profound changes it will bring to
the whole oil industry will ensure that these men did not lose
their lives in vain,'' Shurtz said.
   Occidental said it already has implemented many of Cullen's
recommendations after studying the evidence at the inquiry.
   The U.K. Offshore Operators Association, which represents 36 gas
and oil companies working in the North Sea, welcomed the report as
a ``blueprint for the future.''
   Director Harold Hughes said the companies already have spent
$1.5 billion on improving safety.
   He also said giving the Health and Safety Executive
responsibility for offshore safety would provide a strong,
independent framework to reassure people of oil rig safety.
   Under the recommendations, the Health and Safety Executive would
have the power to close down rigs if they do not meet new safety
standards.

   Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates today
outlined his vision of the futuire of personal computers in which
the desktop machines will provide access to almost unlimited
information.
   In the keynote address at the giant Comdex computer show, Gates
described a future in which computers are vastly more useful and
easier to use.
   Gates, whose company developed the most widely used operating
system for personal computers, outlined new technology that will
bring video, voice and handwriting recognition capability to
personal computers.
   ``This is a formidable challenge. No single company is going to
be able to do this,'' he said.
   Gates called for cooperation among computer hardware and
software companies to bring about his vision which he calls
``information at your fingertips.''
   In an amusing series of videos on a giant screen, Gates depicted
how computers containing these new technologies would be used in a
mythical town of Twin Points, a spoof of the TV series ``Twin
Peaks.''
   He showed how a deliveryman used a handheld computer that
recognized handwriting to enter orders, how students at a school
could use a computer much like an encyclopedia today and how a
couple building a house could ``walk through'' their a
three-dimensional model of their proposed home on a computer
screen.
   Gates said these new technologies are not some science fiction
dream but are all under development or are already in use.
   Gates' speech kicked off a weeklong Comdex show that promoters
say attracted about 120,000 computer retailers, distributors and
other industry people.

<HEAD>New Crisis Erupts Over Agriculture in Trade Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The collapse of weekend talks on farm subsidies
jeopardizes next month's meeting to conclude ambitious accords for
liberalizing trade, a top trade official warned Monday.
   Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, told an emergency meeting of senior trade
negotiators that major political hurdles remained. The emergency
meeting was convened after talks on cutting farm subisidies broke
up in disarray.
   Dunkel called for ``basic changes in present positions in the
next hours or, at most the next days.''
   ``It is not an exagggeration to say that the Brussels meeting is
now in jeopardy,'' he told a special session of GATT's Trade
Negotiations Committee which is overseeing the Uruguay Round of
trade talks.
   The talks, launched in 1986, are meant to end by Dec. 7 with
far-reaching agreements to reduce barriers to trade in 15 sectors.
   Hopes of progress in agriculture, the linchpin in the entire
talks, were dashed Saturday when the United States and a group of
farm exporting nations rejected a European Community proposal on
cuts in farm supports. They also said offers from Japan and South
Korea were inadequate.
   ``The EC hasn't yet demonstrated to others that it has the
flexibility to negotiate a package,'' Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Rufus Yerxa said in a telephone interview.
   Yerxa called for ``significant movement in key areas ...
including export subsidies.''
   The 12-nation trading bloc submitted its proposal only last
Thursday after a month's internal wrangling. It offers an overall
30 percent cut in farm supports but does not give commitments in
specific areas. The cuts over 10 years would be back-dated to 1986,
thus giving the EC credit for measures already taken.
   An EC official, who requested anonymity, described the offer as
``substantial.'' He urged Washington to adopt a ``more realistic
approach'' to cuts in farm support.
   The United States and the 14-nation Cairns Group of farm
exporters have proposed reductions of 75 percent in internal
supports and import barriers. They want export subsidies to be
slashed by 90 percent as these are considered the most trade
distorting. The reforms would take place over 10 years, using 1991
as base-year.
   Japan's offer also provides for a 30 percent cut in farm
supports, but makes no provision for reducing import barriers. In
particular, Tokyo has showed no sign of relaxing its ban on rice
imports.
   South Korea, another big food importer, has similarly said it is
ready to negotiate reductions of up to 30 percent in farm supports
while defending its restrictions on rice imports.
   The trade source said no date was set for the resumption of
talks on agriculture as progress was now dependent on new
instructions from capitals. The source spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The ball is in the Community's court,'' Yerxa said.
   The deadlock in the Uruguay Round is expected to be high on the
agenda when U.S. President George Bush meets EC Commission
President Jacques Delors and Italian Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti in Washington on Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, thousands of European farmers are expected to
assemble with their livstock at GATT's Geneva headquarters to
protest at what they see as attempts to cut their living standards.

   The Midwest is thinking about earthquakes.
Survival kits are popping up on store shelves and companies are
hawking everything from anti-shatter window film to portable
chemical toilets.
   ``It's incredible, the response we're getting,'' said Henry
Lawson, vice president of CEPP Corp. of Los Angeles, the nation's
largest emergency preparedness firm. ``We're shipping thousands of
kits. We're getting lots of orders.''
   The sudden upswing in business stems from a projection by New
Mexico climatologist Iben Browning. He says there's a 50 percent
chance of a major earthquake occurring Dec. 3 on the New Madrid
Fault.
   The fault zone runs from Marked Tree, Ark., north to Cairo,
Ill., and touches portions of Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee,
Illinois and Kentucky.
   On Thursday night, a minor earthquake near New Madrid, Mo.,
shook some homes and heightened worry. The tremor was felt in at
least three states, but there were no reports of damage or
injuries.
   Browning's projection has been roundly criticized by earthquake
experts and geologists as nothing more than a random guess, but
that hasn't prevented schools, businesses and residents from
preparing for the big one.
   And companies that specialize in earthquake preparedness are
getting ready for a big surge in business this week because they
expect a two-part NBC mini-series about an temblor in Los Angeles
will stir up more concern. Scientists and emergency officials have
criticized that series, which ends tonight, for exaggerating the
death and devastation a big quake would cause.
   CEPP Corp. is one of at least a dozen companies or groups
selling various emergency kits that range in cost from $15 to $150
and include such items as thermal blankets, pouches of water and
food guaranteed to last five years, flashlights and first-aid
supplies.
   Another California company, The Emergency Lifeline of Santa Ana,
is conducting 16 emergency preparedness seminars in the region at
$50 a person and has mailed 10,000 catalogs to schools and
businesses here.
   The catalog includes such items as:
   - ``QuakeBrace,'' which uses industrial-strength Velcro to
fasten computer equipment or other expensive items to walls or
desktops.
   - a combination radio and flashlight powered by a hand-cranked
generator.
   - shatter-resistant window film that can prevent flying or
falling glass.
   - a portable chemical toilet.
   ``I'm sure all of the companies in the emergency preparedness
business have their eyes on the Midwest,'' said Kathy Gannon, a
native Missourian who founded the Santa Ana company five years ago.
``There's already getting to be a glut of kits on the market.''
   These products are familiar to Californians, rattled by many
quakes over the years. The emergency preparedness industry has been
growing quickly there since the mid-1980s, but the Midwest is
really the first new market.
   Gannon and Lawson said they expect that what's happening in the
Midwest gradually will occur in other parts of the country and
around the world as more people begin preparing for natural
disasters.
   ``The '90s have been named the decade of emergency preparedness
by the United Nations,'' Gannon said.

   Soybeans futures prices rallied in light trading
from sharp weekend losses Monday as commercial buyers began to cash

   Soybean futures prices slipped sharply Friday, to an 8{-month

larger than expected supply of soybeans.
   The USDA monthly crop report, released after Thursday's close,
raised the soybean production estimate 4.4 percent to 1.9 billion
bushels from the October estimate of 1.82 billion. The market had
expected a number near 1.84 billion.
   The Veterans Day holiday kept most traders on the sidelines, but
some commercial buyers snapped up the low-priced commodity, said
John Frazier, director of the agricultural division at Gerald Inc.
   ``Soybeans have been beat down for a long time, so it was
expected they would go up,'' Frazier said. ``We're just biding time
till tomorrow when everybody comes back.''
   Grains, pressured by weak export business in the face of large
world supplies, continued their slide.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were 2\ cents to 1} cents
lower with December at $2.64 a bushel; corn futures were } cent
lower to } cent higher with December at $2.30{ a bushel; oats were
3} cents to 3\ cents lower with December at $1.14\ a bushel;
soybeans were 4\ cents to 3\ cents higher with November at $5.70{ a
bushel.

<HEAD>Shanker Quits Channel One Board, Plans to Host Show on Companion
Channel</HEAD>

   A leading teachers union official has quit as an
advisor to the Whittle Communications' service that provides
commercially-sponsored news programs for classroom viewing.
   Albert Shanker, head of the American Federation of Teachers,
said he was resigning from the Channel One Council of Advisors
because his membership on the panel left the impression he was
endorsing advertising in public schools.
   But even as he stepped down from the 12-member advisory board,
Shanker apparently agreed to serve as host of a program for
teachers that will be carried on a commercial-free companion
service to Channel One.
   William Gubbins, a group editor at Whittle Communications, said
Shanker is scheduled next week to tape the first segment of a
monthly series ``The World of Teaching - An Anthology'' designed
for teachers.
   The program will be carried on a private network that Whittle is
calling The Educators' Channel. That service will be delivered over
the same system that carries Channel One, a daily 12-minute news
show with advertising for teens in the classroom, into an estimated
5,000 schools.
   Shanker could not be reached Monday to comment on his plans. The
AFT offices in Washington, D.C., were closed for the Veterans' Day
holiday.
   But according to an Oct. 12 letter sent to Whittle Chairman
Christopher Whittle, Shanker said he made it clear when he agreed
to be on the Channel One advisory panel that ``my decision in no
way constituted an endorsement either of the programming or of
advertising in the public schools.''
   ``In fact, I explicitly stated my role would be that of a `watch
dog','' Shanker wrote.
   Shanker told Whittle he should have known that being on the
council would ``inevitably lead to the perception that I endorsed
Channel One.''
   But he said that realization was not driven home until he saw
his name and picture being used in Channel One promotional
materials.
   As a result, he said he was resigning the post on the advisory
council immediately and asked that his name and picture no longer
be used on Channel One promotional materials.
   The situation was particularly sensitive for Shanker since the
policymaking arm of the teachers group he heads has gone on record
against showing TV commercials in the classroom.
   He noted the teachers' panel also ``condemned the lack of
resources that put schools and districts in the position of
accepting commercials in return for equipment.''
   Schools that agree to show the Channel One news show with ads to
their students every day are loaned a satellite dish, videocassette
recorder and TV monitors for every classroom for as long as they
show the program.
   The same satellite system is used to transmit the Channel One
news show and the Educators' Channel to the schools.
   Tom Ingram, a spokesman for Whittle Communications in Knoxville,
Tenn., said Shanker also told the company other commitments had
made it impossible for him to attend any of the advisory board's
meetings.
   He said Whittle has agreed to take Shanker's name off any new
promotional materials for Channel One although the company will
continue to use materials already in stock that may include his
name or picture.
   ``While we are sorry he was not able to participate on the
advisory board, we are excited about still having him on the
Educators' Network,'' Ingram said.

   The Federal Reserve, responding to increasing
signs of a recession, soon will cut interest rates in a move that
should prompt banks to lower a variety of consumer and business
rates, many private economists predicted Monday.
   The Fed's credit easing is likely to spur a one-half percentage
point cut in the prime lending rate, and home mortgage rates should
decline modestly as well, many analysts said.
   Any reduction in the prime rate, which has been stuck at 10
percent since January, would be seen as a boost to economic
activity because about one-third of all consumer and business loans
are tied to changes in the prime.
   The Fed's top policy-making body, the Federal Open Market
Committee, will meet behind closed doors Tuesday to map interest
rate strategy.

the very least, vote L-ee brahnt

<HEAD>Price Relinquishes Day-to-Day Control at The National</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president and publisher of The National has
been relieved of day-to-day duties at the sports daily and three
other top executives have been dismissed, a company spokesman
confirmed Monday.
   An executive associated with the Mexican media and entertainment
concern that is the paper's biggest shareholder has been brought in
to take greater control of operations at the 9-month-old newspaper.
   The moves come as the paper continues to absorb heavy losses in
its bid to become the United States' first national sports daily.
   Backers of the newspaper have run into a miserable advertising
climate and skepticism about the potential audience for a daily
publication devoted exclusively to sports.
   Peter O. Price will continue to hold the titles president and
publisher but will be involved with broad, non-operational issues,
a spokesman for the paper, Steve Hammond, said.
   He said Price would be involved, for instance, in planning for
the rollout into new markets. The National is currently available
in nine markets with plans to expand into three more -
Baltimore-Washington, Philadelphia and Atlanta - by early 1991.
   Hammond said the three executives dismissed last week were Diane
Morgenthaler, circulation director; Timothy Lasker, assistant
publisher, and Daniel W. Correa, finance and administration
director.
   He said none of the three has yet been replaced. He described
the changes as a ``business decision,'' but declined to elaborate.
   Price has been unavailable for comment for the past several
days. Calls placed Monday to Price and all three dismissed
executives were not returned.
   Hammond confirmed that Jaime Davila has been brought in to
assume Price's operating responsibilities at the newspaper, whose
biggest shareholder is Emilio Azcarraga, the Mexican media baron.
   Davila is a top executive at Univisa Inc., the U.S. subsidiary
of Mexico's Televisa entertainment and publishing concern that
Azcarraga heads.
   Davila and Azcarraga were also said to be unavailable for
comment.
   It was disclosed last week that The National will cease
publishing a Sunday edition after Nov. 25 and publish only on
weekdays. The paper had been publishing six days a week, Sunday
through Friday, since its launch Jan. 31.
   Editor-in-chief Frank Deford also said last week there will be a
handful of jobs cuts at the paper, which employs about 200 people,
but that he was hopeful the cuts could be made through attrition
rather than layoffs.
   The National was launched in three cities - New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles - and has since begun publishing editions in San
Diego, San Francisco, Detroit, Dallas, Boston and Miami.

   A broadcast company with television
stations in Providence and Columbus, Ohio, said Monday it no longer
will actively seek a buyer.
   Outlet Communications Inc., which has sold most of its broadcast
properties, also reported a third-quarter net loss of $268,000,
better than the $2.2 million loss reported a year ago.
   Revenues were $11.3 million vs. $22.5 million a year ago.
   Outlet said it had discontinued the services of financial
adviser First Boston Corp., which had been exploring a possible
sale, merger or other alternatives.
   David E. Henderson, Outlet's chairman, president and chief
executive, said the slumping economy made a sale unlikely.
   The idea was to find ``a public corporate structure who would
buy the stock of the company,'' he said. ``It doesn't appear in
this climate that we're going to find a buyer. There's nothing in
the wind to suggest our current economy is going to improve.''

<HEAD>Oil Drops $2 As War Seems More Distant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil fell more than $2 per barrel on the futures
market Monday, as traders decided rising supplies posed a greater
immediate threat than war in the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's de-escalation of the war premium, the prospect that war
might be delayed,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst
with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Light sweet crude tumbled $2.02 to $31.87 per barrel for
December contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts
for delivery of crude in later months all dropped. Trading volume
was lighter than usual because of Veterans Day.
   The drop followed a decline of $1.64 per barrel for next month
delivery on Friday, when a wild rumor of an Iraqi coup depressed
prices at the end of the day.
   Traders on Monday said war with Iraq did not seem as likely in
the near future because news stories have indicated President Bush
lacks the domestic and foreign support he needs to try to push
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   ``A lot of people are feeling it's not so close, so they're
liquidating,'' said Christian Gohler, a broker with Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures.
   Gohler said oil futures also fell because world oil supplies
have been on the rise, despite the boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
crude.
   ``At the moment, the market is being extremely well supplied,
because the OPEC nations and others have increased production to
meet demand,'' Gohler said. Traders anticipated the next weekly
statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, which are to be
released Tuesday evening, would show the U.S. crude oil stockpile
has increased.
   Hittle also pointed out that some sour crude is not being
unloaded in Europe because of a lack of immediate demand.
   As oil took its dive Monday, so did most other energy futures
traded on the exchange.
   Home heating oil was off 3.72 cents at 86.52 cents a gallon for
December contracts, with contracts for delivery in later months all
moving down as well.
   Unleaded gasoline fell 4.70 cents to 83.53 per gallon for
December contracts, with later delivery month contracts falling.
   Natural gas futures were mixed, with December contracts down 1.9
cents at $2.41 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Separately, the Mercantile Exchange announced steps Monday that
will enable oil traders to buy futures contracts up to 36 months in
advance, twice the current 18-month limit. The exchange asked
regulators for the extention in August, when Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait threw world oil markets into a state of chaos.
   ``With the growing volume and open interest in the back months
of our existing contract, industry need for a long-term hedging
vehicle became evident,'' the exchange's chairman, Z. Lou Guttman,
said in a statement. The more distant months will become available
beginning Nov. 20.

<HEAD>Dollar Declines in Thin Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>

   The dollar fell broadly in sleepy trading on
world currency markets Monday, largely on anticipation the Federal
Reserve would move this week to lower interest rates. Gold prices
were lower.
   Trading was extremely light with many bank trading floors closed
in observation of Veterans Day. Lack of news indicating increased
volatility in the Middle East kept investors focused on what te
Fed might do after Tuesday's meeting of its policy committee.
   Lower interest rates generally diminish the value of the dollar.
   ``With the war specter off the horizon and with rumors that the
Fed will drop rates by tomorrow, there's nothing positive for the
dollar at the moment,'' said Michael McGuinness, vice president of
Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank.
   Also driving down the dollar's value against foreign currencies
was a slide in oil futures prices. Traders were discouraged by a
$2.02 drop in the December contract for light, sweet crude to
$31.87 per barrel.
   The oil drop added strength to the yen because traders read it
as a favorable sign for Japan's oil-dependent economy.
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at
128.30 yen, down from Friday's 129.70. In overnight trading in
Tokyo, the dollar traded at 130.50 yen, unchanged from Friday's
close, and in London, it fell to 128.80 yen.
   The British pound also strengthened to $1.9660 from $1.9655 late
Friday. In earlier London trading, the British pound traded at
$1.9627, compared with $1.9670 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
rates included: 1.4770 German marks, down from 1.4870; 1.2468 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2499; 4.9700 French francs, down from 4.9940;
1,113.00 Italian lire, down from 1119.00; 1.1664 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1683.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.4805 German marks, down from 1.4875; 1.2500 Swiss francs, up from
1.2495; 4.9755 French francs, down from 4.9940; 1.6700 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.6775; 1,113.25 Italian lire, down from
1,119.50; 1,1665 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1698.
   Gold declined in light domestic trading. It fell $2.50 a troy
ounce to $382.30 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Republic
National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $381.50, down
$2.90.
   In earlier trading, gold fell in London to a late bid price of
$382.25 a troy ounce, from $384.75 bid late Friday.In Zurich, the
metal fell to a closing bid of $381.00, down from $385.80 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped 97 cents an ounce to close
at $383.61 on Monday.
   Silver fell on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.19 a troy
ounce, down 3.1 cents. In London, silver bullion fell to a late bid
price of $4.24 a troy ounce, down from $4.25 bid late Friday.

   Gold and silver futures prices, following the lead of oil
futures, declined Monday on a day of light trading highlighted by a
consensus that war in the Persian Gulf is not imminent.
   On other commodities markets, soybean futures rose; grains fell;
and livestock and meat were mostly higher.
   Gold settled on New York's Commodity Exchange $4.10 to $2.50
lower with the contract for delivery in November at $382.30 a troy
ounce; silver settled 4.4 cents to 3.1 cents lower with November at
$4.19 an ounce.
   The two precious metals slipped during a quiet Veterans Day
holiday session marked by indications that the United States will
not go to war with Iraq anytime soon, said Frederick Demler, a
metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in New York.
   ``The session came in with the Japanese markets closed today
because of the enthronement (of a new emperor) and later dropped
off because nobody thinks we're going to war in the foreseeable
future,'' Demler said.
   ``Oil prices were off a little over $2 and the Dow was up over
60 points, which was a negative for precious metals,'' he said.
   Oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell
after Democratic lawmakers remained adamant that President Bush
must get the support of Congress before attacking Iraq or seeking
to liberate Kuwait.
   Light sweet crude settled $2.02 to 17 cents lower with December
at $31.87 a barrel; heating oil settled 3.83 cents to 1.83 cents
lower with December at 86.52 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
settled 4.70 cents to 3 cents lower with December at 83.53 cents a
gallon.
   Soybeans futures prices rallied from sharp weekend losses on the
Chicago Board of Trade as commercial buyers began to cash in on the
oversold product.
   Soybean futures prices slipped to an 8{-month low on Friday,
following an Agriculture Department report that indicated a larger
than expected supply of soybeans.
   The USDA monthly crop report, released after Thursday's close,
raised the soybean production estimate 4.4 percent to 1.9 billion
bushels from the October estimate of 1.82 billion. The market had
expected a number near 1.84 billion.
   The holiday kept most traders on the sidelines, but some
commercial buyers snapped up the low-priced commodity, said John
Frazier, director of the agricultural division at Gerald Inc. in
Chicago.
   ``Soybeans have been beat down for a long time, so it was
expected they would go up,'' Frazier said.
   Grains, pressured by weak export business in the face of large
world supplies, continued their slide.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were 2\ cents to 1} cents
lower with December at $2.64 a bushel; corn futures were } cent
lower to } cent higher with December at $2.30{ a bushel; oats were
3} cents to 3\ cents lower with December at $1.14\ a bushel;
soybeans were 4\ cents to 3\ cents higher with November at $5.70{ a
bushel.
   Cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange continued
their advance, rising on strength in the cash cattle and beef
markets.
   Hog prices at the Merc were lifted by the perception that cash
prices are near a seasonal bottom and should begin to move higher
later this week as numbers decrease and demands increase. Frozen
pork bellies continued higher because of low supplies of frozen
stocks.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .35 cent higher with
December at 78.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle was unchanged to .27
cent higher with November at 88.15 cents a pound; hogs were .57
cent to 1.17 cents higher with December at 53.52 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with February at
71.85 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Trump Appoints New Head Of Trump City Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump Monday named a new chief for the
Trump City project, a Manhattan office, retail and housing
development that has been stalled for five years.
   Barbara Res, 41, a 10-year veteran of the Trump Organization,
will take over the project.
   She said Trump wanted to signal that ``we are very much going
forward with it and putting it in high gear.''
   Res oversaw the construction of Trump Tower and is directing the
$1 billion redevelopment of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.
   Trump bought the land for the $5 billion project on Manhattan's
West Side in 1985 for $100 million. Trump plans the world's largest
building, luxury apartments and a shopping mall for the 76-acre
parcel, an unused rail yard.
   The plan has been held up, in part, by activists who oppose the
project for environmental reasons.
   Res replaces Anthony B. Giledman, 48, who announced last week he
was leaving Trump to become chief executive of New York-based Amrep
Corp., which builds moderate-priced housing in New Mexico and
Florida.
   Res said in a telephone interview she can't predict when the
project might get started.
   ``Unfortunately, we've had this project around a long time. I
could have given you a date three years ago and we'd be past it
already,'' she said.
   Stephen Bollenbach, Trump Organization's chief financial
officer, said Monday there aren't any payments currently due on the
loan for the property.
   The Trump Organization is supposed to pay $47 million in
interest Nov. 15 on $675 worth of bonds sold to finance the Taj
Mahal hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Last month, Trump unveiled a financial restructuring proposal,
and warned bondholders that the Taj Mahal might be forced into
bankruptcy court if the plan is turned down.
   The restructuring would give bondholders a nearly 20 percent
equity stake in the billion-dollar Taj Mahal in return for changes
in the terms of the junk bonds.
   The plan called for the interest rate on the bonds to be lowered
to 9 percent from their current 14 percent. It also calls for the
Nov. 15 payment to be met by issuing additional bonds.
   Wilbur Ross, a bondholder representative, rejected the plan,
saying the offer was too low.

   Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates unveiled
his grand vision of the future of personal computing Monday, an era
in which desktop and handheld machines will provide a window to
vast amounts of information.
   In the keynote address at the giant Comdex computer show, Gates
described a future in which computers are much more useful and
easier to use.
   Gates, whose company developed the most widely used operating
system for personal computers, outlined new technologies that will
bring video, voice and handwriting recognition capabilities to
personal computers.
   ``This is a formidable challenge. No single company is going to
be able to do this,'' he said.
   Gates called for cooperation among computer hardware and
software companies to bring about his vision, which he calls
``information at your fingertips.''
   In an amusing series of videos on a giant screen, Gates depicted
how computers containing these new technologies would be used in
the mythical town of Twin Points, a spoof of the TV series ``Twin
Peaks.''
   In one example, he showed how a deliveryman for Twin Points
Bakery would use a book-sized handheld computer that recognized
handwriting to enter orders at a grocery store.
   Using a special pen, or stylus, the deliveryman wrote in the
orders for various items on the computer screen. The computer
verified the order by printing the quantity.
   When the grocer balked at ordering a certain amount of one item,
the deliveryman used the screen to display a bar chart showing how
much of that item sold at the store in a certain period.
   When the grocer also ordered a new display rack, the computer
flashed a warning that he was over his credit limit with the
bakery.
   But through a cellular phone device inside the machine, the
computer contacted a central computer at the bakery, which then
authorized the display rack but required the grocer to ``sign'' for
it on the handheld computer screen, using the stylus.
   In another video, Gates showed how a student using a
computerized encyclopedia could do a report on the state of
Washington, where Microsoft is based.
   A ``page'' of the encyclopedia depicting facts about Washington
showed a picture of the state bird. Beside the bird was a small
picture, called an icon, of several musical notes. When the student
moved an on-screen arrow to the icon, and then pushed a button on a
device called a mouse, the computer played a short audio passage of
the bird's song stored in its memory.
   The encyclopedia also gave a chart of the state's leading
industries, software among them. When the arrow was placed on
``Microsoft,'' a small picture of the company's offices came on the
screen. When the arrow was moved to the picture and the mouse
button pushed, the computer played a video of several of the
company's employees.
   Gates also showed a video of a couple designing a house. When
they wanted to visualize various layouts, their architect allowed
them to ``walk through'' a three-dimensional model of their
proposed home on a computer screen. The couple also could see on
the screen how various color schemes would look, and when they
wanted to look at appliances, the architect called up a video
advertisement from an oven manufacturer.
   Gates, 35, said these new technologies are not some science
fiction dream, but are under development or already in use. In
fact, such combinations of text, graphics, sound and videos -
called multimedia computing - are among the hot topics at this
year's Comdex.
   One of the keys to Gates' vision is tying together the
technologies of handwriting recognition, computerized video, fax,
cellular phones, computing networks and vast data bases in one
seamless hardware and software package.
   But, he said, several obstacles need to be removed before his
scheme becomes reality.
   One is that personal computers are too hard to use. Another, he
said, is that ``people have a very narrow view of how the PC should
be used.''
   Gates' speech kicked off a weeklong Comdex show that promoters
say has attracted about 120,000 computer retailers, distributors
and others in the industry.

   Falling oil prices and hopes for lower interest
rates provided the inspiration as the stock market staged a strong
advance Monday, extending the rally it began late last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 44.80 points on
Friday, climbed another 51.74 to 2,540.35.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,163 up, 381 down and 433 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.39 million
shares, against 145.16 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 199.64 million shares.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery dropped more than
$2 a barrel, to about $31.75 a barrel, in Monday's trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Beyond that immediate stimulus, analysts said traders were
encouraged by increasing talk of actions soon by the Federal
Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Recent economic evidence has spotlighted signs of economic
weakness, along with some indications that inflationary pressures
might be easing.
   That trend is widely presumed in the financial world to be
giving the Fed more leeway to loosen credit conditions.
   Bank and other financial issues extended their recent upswing,
which has been spraked by hopes that lower interest rates would
ease financial strains and shore up the real-estate markets.
   In the banking group, J.P. Morgan gained 2 to 42{; BankAmerica
1{ to 23}; Citicorp 1 to 13\; Chase Manhattan | to 11, and Chemical
Banking ~ to 12.
   Elsewhere among financial stocks, Federal National Mortgage rose
1{ to 32; Kemper Corp. 2&rsqb; to 20\; Great Western Financial 1&lsqb; to
11\; Federal Home Loan Mortgage 1| to 39~, and American Express 2

   Point-plus gainers among the blue-chip industrials included
International Business Machines, up 2} at 113; General Electric, up
1| at 55&rsqb;; General Motors, up 1&lsqb; at 38}; McDonald's, up 1{ at 28},
and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1&rsqb; at 82.
   Pan Am Corp. rose \ to 1~ in active trading following the
weekend news of a conditional bid for Pan Am by Carl Icahn,
chairman of Trans World Airlines.
   Other airline issues also fared well. UAL climbed 4| to 100\;
Delta Air Lines 2 to 57&rsqb;, and AMR 1~ to 48&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $52.63 billion, or
1.80 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.90 to 174.07.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.24 to 373.35, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 5.74 at 319.48.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
jumped 9.51 to 351.46. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 294.78, up 3.75.

<HEAD>Investigators: Milken May Have Made $1 Billion More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fallen junk bond king Michael R. Milken may
have made an additional $1 billion during the 1980s from limited
partnerships formed with other Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
employees, congressional investigators claim.
   Confirming earlier published reports, a House staffer said
Monday that information derived from the General Accounting Office,
an investigative arm of Congress, indicates Milken formed some 30
partnerships with other employees of the now-bankrupt securities
firm. Those partnerships paid out as much as $2 billion between
1981 and 1989, the House staffer said.
   There was no indication how much of that amount was actually
profit, however and the amounts attributed to Milken and other
individuals were only estimates.
   The House source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
Monday that convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky testified
behind closed doors to the oversight subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee about his dealings with Milken.
   The oversight subcommittee has been investigating hundreds of
Milken-created Drexel partnerships for several years, but no
evidence of illegal activity has been presented. Drexel ended the
practice shortly after it came to light two years ago, however.
   A spokesman for Milken declined comment on the matter.
   But a source close to the Milken camp noted the information
about the huge payouts was disclosed shortly before the former head
of Drexel's junk bond department is to be sentenced in a massive
Wall Street fraud case.
   Milken pleaded guilty in April to six securities-related felony
charges and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties. He faces up to
28 years in prison when he is sentencd by a federal judge in New
York, who is expected to set a sentencing date soon.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the oversight
subcommittee, wants Milken to testify - after his sentencing -
about trading accounts owned by hundreds of limited partnerships he
formed with Drexel co-workers, family members and friends.
   The partnerships bought up significant percentages of hot junk
bond issues before they were made available to the general public.
   Critics say the activity drove up the price of those issues at
the expense of Drexel customers.
   Federal prosecutors revealed that Drexel paid Milken, mastermind
of the firm's rise to prominence in the high-yield, high-risk junk
bond business, a total of $1.1 billion between 1984 and 1987,
including $550 in the final year. That $550 million paycheck put
him the Guiness Book of World Records.
   The information stemming from the subcommittee probe, while not
proof of illegal activity, suggests the magnitude of the deals and
how lucrative they could be, said the subcommitte source.
   The information consisted of a list of 30 limited partnerships
and the total amount each distributed to investors during the
1980s.
   But the one-page list does not specify individual investors nor
does it indicate how much of the payouts were profit over and above
the initial investment.
   The subcommittee source said investigators knew from court
documents what percentage major players in the Drexel scandal held
in the partnerships. Using that information combined with the
totals generated by the GAO probe ``you worked backwards'' to
estimate amounts received by individuals, said the source.
   ``It gives you a pretty good road map in terms of who was
involved in what,'' he said.
   Milken, who invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination when called to testify before the subcommittee
two years ago, is expected to testify after he is sentenced.
   Boesky, who settled a massive insider trading case by pleading
guilty to one felony count and agreeing to pay $100 million in
penalties, has been interviewed extensively by subcommittee
staffers and testified for about three hours before the
subcommittee in a closed-door hearing in August, the source said.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings and loan regulator Timothy Ryan
told thrift executives Monday that his agency will make it easier
for them to convert their institutions into commercial banks.
   The move, based on a legal opinion by Office of Thrift
Supervision Chief Counsel Harris Weinstein, could hasten the end of
S&amp;Ls as a separate financial industry.
   Ryan, who is director of the thrift office, told the 98th annual
convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions that he
believed financial institutions could still earn a good profit as
housing lenders.
   ``The ranks of the most successful thrifts ... are dominated by
those who stuck to the home mortgage business,'' he said.
   But, he said, S&amp;Ls should also be free, as contemplated under
last year's S&amp;L bailout law, to move into commercial banking if
they desired.
   The government so far has seized more than 500 failed S&amp;Ls,
disposing of 300 of them. Most of the 300 have been turned over to
banks. Also, so far the thrift office has approved 22 applications
from healthy thrifts wanting to become banks. Another 22
applications are pending.
   However, he said he remained ``deeply troubled'' by S&amp;Ls
becoming state savings banks. These institutions are similar to
S&amp;Ls, but have fewer restrictions on how they may invest their
deposits. Last year's law, for instance, requires S&amp;Ls, but not
state savings banks, to devote 70 percent of their assets to home
mortgage loans.
   After delivering a speech to some 1,300 S&amp;L executives, Ryan
told reporters that he was less concerned with the housing
requirement, which also can be circumvented by conversion to either
a commercial bank or a savings bank, and most concerned with S&amp;Ls
using conversion to evade bans on buying junk bonds and investing
directly in speculative real estate development projects.
   ``We're not going to put up with that kind of behavior,'' he
said.
   He noted that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was working on
regulations to extend the reforms of last year's law to savings
banks. In that case, he said he would not oppose S&amp;Ls converting to
savings banks.
   Frederick L. Webber, president of the league, said most S&amp;Ls
want to convert, not to evade reforms, but to shed themselves of
expensive examination fees charged by the thrift office.
   As S&amp;Ls fail or convert to banks, fewer institutions remain
behind to support the regulatory apparatus.
   Ryan drew cheers when he told S&amp;L executives he would cut the
assessments they pay. He said he has already cut spending from a
planned $330 million this year to $280 million and reduced his
staff from 3,500 to 3,000.
   Despite the reductions, he said he would increase the number of
examiners in the field. He said his goal was to examine large
institutions and those in poor or average condition every year and
others every 18 months.
   Ryan also drew cheers when he said he favored simplifying the
regulatory apparatus so that only one agency regulates financial
institutions. Many S&amp;L executives have concluded that they would
rather be supervised by banking regulators.
   On another matter, Ryan said he was discussing with the
Resolution Trust Corp., which dismantles failed thrifts, a plan to
delay seizing some virtually insolvent institutions.
   The RTC has so far taken over more than 500 failed thrifts,
leaving about 2,400 still operating privately. Of those, the agency
considers roughly 170 all but certain to fail.
   But, because Congress adjourned without providing the RTC with
additional rescue money, Ryan said his agency was considering
placing some of the 170 into a supervisory management program
provided they had little or no continuing losses and stable,
competent management.
   When money became available later, these S&amp;Ls will be rescued
without being transferred to the RTC, he said.

<HEAD>Time Warner Loses MCA Records Distribution Deal to German Media
Giant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCA Inc. said Monday that its
music unit will shift its $100 million overseas distribution
business from Time Warner Inc. to Germany's Bertelsmann Music
Group.
   The deal hands a big chunk of business to Bertelsmann at a time
when MCA officials are discussing a buyout for as much as $8
billion by Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   It's another example of how entwined the U.S. entertainment
business has become with overseas companies. As worldwide music
sales approach $20 billion a year, with only a third of that
domestic, four of the nation's six major record concerns are now
foreign-owned.
   Bertelsmann Music Group, part of the giant media company
Bertelsmann AG, operates in 30 countries and owns labels including
RCA, Arista, Zoo and Ariola. The parent company has indicated it
will spend $4 billion on entertainment deals over the next three
years.
   The new three-year deal calls for Bertelsmann to give MCA $37
million a year in promotion, marketing and other support. Officials
of both companies said an important part of the partnership will be
developing new talent.
   MCA and Bertelsmann said their agreement covers the distribution
and licensing of MCA, Geffen and GRP records.
   The licensing agreement is worldwide except for North America,
the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. MCA has its own company in
the UK and recently announced it was forming a new record company
in Japan in a joint venture with Japanese interests.
   MCA said it also intends to establish its own record company in
Germany, the world's third largest record-selling territory behind
North America and Japan with about 9 percent of worldwide record
sales.
   Bertelsmann Music Group will be the distributor for that company
as well as for MCA's existing company in the United Kingdom, MCA
said.
   MCA's distribution agreement with Time Warner's Warner Music
International expires April 1. Geffen Records had its own deal with
Warner Music International, and will be distributed by Bertelsmann
beginning Jan. 1.

<HEAD>TWA Offer For Pan Am Probably Won't Fly, Analysts Say</HEAD>

   Trans World Airlines Inc.'s offer to merge with
Pan Am Corp. raises new questions about troubled Pan Am's immediate
future, but analysts said Monday they doubted the deal would fly.
   ``As far as I can see, it's sort of hazy at the moment,'' said
Thomas Canning, at Standard &amp; Poor's. ``We've got to wait for the
reaction from Pan Am. For their fiduciary duties, they have to
consider it.''
   Analysts said Pan Am will probably proceed with plans to sell
prized London routes to UAL Corp. in a $400 million deal that also
includes a cooperative marketing agreement. The airlines would
coordinate flights and feed passengers to each other.
   Pan Am said that the UAL deal, which is supposed to be completed
by Wednesday, was its current ``focus.'' But Pan Am refused to
comment on the merits or status of TWA's offer, made Friday in a
letter from TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn to Pan Am Chairman Thomas G.
Plaskett.
   ``We are not going to comment on whether or not we have had any
communications with Mr. Icahn since we have received his letter,''
Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.
   She said, however, that Pan Am understood Icahn's offer would
only come into play if the agreement with UAL is not completed
Wednesday.
   ``It is a binding agreement and (the TWA offer) certainly does
not change that agreement,'' Hanlon said. But the UAL deal does not
prevent Pan Am from discussing a merger, she said.
   UAL refused to say whether it believes the TWA offer jeopardizes
its pact with Pan Am. ``Talk to Pan Am,'' spokesman Joe Hopkins
said.
   Icahn proposed offering about $150 million in cash and
securities with a face value of $300 million for Pan Am. Since the
cash value of the securities would vary, analysts were uncertain
whether Pan Am stockholders would gain money or lose money through
the transaction.
   Pan Am stock rose \ to 1~ in active trading Monday.
   Pan Am and TWA are the only U.S. carriers to fly into London's
Heathrow Airport, the most desirable destination in the city that
is considered the gateway to Europe. Analysts predicted a TWA-Pan
AM merger would face regulatory troubles because the government
would not want to see all of those routes fall into the same
corporate hands.
   AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, has said it would
pay in excess of $500 million for the London routes, but Pan Am
said it was not interested in merely selling the routes. Pan Am
said its marketing arrangement with UAL would help build up its
Latin American service with flights connecting through Miami.
   Analysts said a TWA-Pan Am merger would likely benefit both
carriers, considered among the weakest in an industry that has been
hit hard by rising fuel costs and sluggish demand for travel.
   ``It would make for a stronger carrier. They would have the
strength of the Atlantic, with the Pan Am Latin American routes,''
Canning said.
   Even if no serious merger talks are held, the publicity
surrounding Icahn's offer has probably helped both both airlines,
according to an analyst with said Icahn might have other motives.
   ``What you see isn't what you get with this guy,'' said Kevin
Murphy, of Morgan Stanley.
   ``If he can prevent United Airlines from going into London, that
would prevent a more formidable carrier from going into Heathrow,''
Murphy said. ``By creating more market forces for international
assets and routes, that can only come back and help him, should he
also decide to sell assets.''
   Without a merger with Pan Am, TWA will be left in a position
where it either needs to buy assets, such as the Atlanta hub and
Miami overhaul base of Eastern Airlines that it has expressed an
interest in, or sell its own assets, analysts said.
   The head of the TWA branch of the Air Line Pilots Association,
Kent Scott, agreed.
   ``I think this is Icahn's way of stirring up interest in TWA and
saying `Hey, I want to do a deal, whether it's buy, sell or
whatever,''' Scott said.
   Analysts say it was too soon to say whether the TWA offer could
spark any reshuffling that would involve more than two airlines.
They doubted the deal could enable Pan Am to seek better terms from
UAL, because the important aspects of that deal had already been
settled.

   The chairman of AB Volvo Monday promised an
investigation of a phony television advertisement that portrayed a
Volvo withstanding the attempts of a ``monster truck'' to crush it.
   Volvo Chairman Pehr G. Gyllenhammar said in a statement that he
would show customers, suppliers and employees that ``I will never
tolerate any kind of misconduct ... that will damage Volvo's name
and excellent reputation.''
   The investigation would try to clarify how the ad came about and
identify those resonsible, he said.
   Volvo pulled the ads last week after admitting that the car in
the ad had been reinforced. The ads had been challenged by the
Texas attorney general.
   Volvo agreed to make no unproven claims, run corrective
newspaper ads and pay Texas $316,250 in investigative costs.
   The ad, filmed in Austin, appears to show a Volvo as the only
car left relatively intact after the truck runs over a line of
autos.
   ``It represents an insult to our company and what we represent
and an insult against all Volvo owners,'' Gyllenhammr said.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS one graf after 5th graf pvs, to UPDATE with Chevron
comment.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   County supervisors Monday rejected
Chevron USA's bid to carry oil from a rich offshore field by tanker
instead of pipeline.
   Chevron says it is cheaper to send oil by tanker to refineries
in Los Angeles, 150 miles south. A pipeline is considered the more
expensive but environmentally safer alternative.
   Tom Rogers, chairman of the supervisors, said Chevron was only
being held to ``tough'' standards it agreed to follow when a permit
was granted for the offshore project some five years ago.
   ``There is a pipeline available,'' Rogers said. ``The symbolism
is not local government holding up the oil companies. If the oil
companies and local government work something out, what is the
commitment of oil companies to adhere to those agreements?''
   The supervisors voted 4-1 after a daylong hearing.
   Chevron responded angrily, saying Santa Barbara officials are
not interested in reaching a rational solution.
   The 2-year-old dispute has idled a $2.5 billion oil project that
includes three offshore oil rigs capable of producing up to 100,000
barrels of crude oil each day.
   The three rigs, Hidalgo, Harvest and Hermosa, already are in
place 10 miles off of Santa Barbara. A processing plant and other
facilities are nearby at Point Arguello.
   Chevron USA is lead partner on the project.
   The firm sought a temporary, four-year shipping permit. It was
expected Chevron would agree to pursue a pipeline operation if
granted the permit, but Rogers said the issue was not raised.
   Rogers said existing pipelines could handle almost all of the
crude produced by the offshore field, sending the oil down to Los
Angeles and up to Northern California for processing.
   ``They don't own pipelines, they own tankers, and that would
maximize profit,'' Rogers said.
