   The outcome was left
hanging Monday in a presidential election in which incumbent
Joaquin Balaguer was leading by less than 1 percent of the vote.
   Leftist challenger Juan Bosch accused conservative Balaguer of
fraud and said Sunday that Balaguer supporters were paying $40 for
voter-registration cards in strongholds of Bosch's Dominican
Liberation Party.
   But some observers believe that Bosch, 80, a former president
overthrown by a military coup in 1963, may have lost the election
through campaign blunders to his 83-year-old rival and the
country's five-time president.
   After tabulating votes for five days, The Central Electoral
Board said Sunday it was suspending further announcements of the
count on recommendation of former President Jimmy Carter, one of 30
international observers.
   Electoral board president Froilan Tavares made no mention of
possible fraud, saying only that officials found errors by some
polling stations in compiling tally sheets.
   Tavares said the count would be suspended pending a review of
tally sheets in the presence of six international observers _ a
laborious process that could take days.
   The final bulletin issued by the electoral board on Saturday
gave Balaguer an 18,227-vote lead over Bosch, but late Monday his
unofficial lead had grown to 21,970 votes, according to the board,
contacted by The Associated Press.
   With 6,645 of the 6,663 polling stations reporting, or 98
percent, Balaguer had 667,039 votes and Bosch 645,069. Jose
Francisco Pena Gomez, a former socialist mayor of Santo Domingo,
was third with 442,598, according to the board.
   After Bosch lost an early lead, he accused Balaguer of
``colossal fraud'' and threatened street protests, but called off
the protests Friday after the electoral board agreed to review
tally sheets.
   Before the election, Bosch said that Balaguer's Social Christian
Reformist Party prepared 300,000 phony votes to rig the election.
Balaguer denied it.
   The estimated 40 percent turnout from about 3.2 registered
voters was the lowest in more than 25 years.
   Balaguer has remained out of public view since Wednesday's
elections. He was said to be in mourning for his sister, Laita, 85,
who died last week.
   Carter said Friday that no candidate had presented evidence of
fraud, but a review of tally sheets would establish whether ``fraud
or honest errors'' had been committed.
   Balaguer, who is blind with glaucoma, appeared to be in trouble
before the election because of this Caribbean island nation's
economic crisis. A $2 billion construction project was popular
among the poor but fueled 50-percent inflation.
   But Bosch confused many Dominicans two weeks before the election
by saying a 1954 agreement with the Vatican providing that all army
chaplains be Roman Catholic should be shelved in ``history
museums.''
   The statement was widely viewed as anti-church in the
overwhelmingly Catholic nation and seemed to support Balaguer's
characterization of Bosch as a dangerous Marxist.
   Bosch may also have been hurt by saying he would deport back to
Cuba Juan Jose Arteaga, a Cuban exile who is Balaguer's chief
economic adviser.

<HEAD>Milwaukee Archbishop: Church May Reconcile Women Who Have
Abortions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Rembert Weakland says some of the
reasons women choose to have abortions can be reconciled by the
church without jeopardizing strict Roman Catholic teaching against
abortion.
   ``Yes. There are possibilities there. One could reconcile their
stance with a church position. I think that is a possibility.
That's why you have to talk with each one,'' Weakland said in an
interview published Monday by the Milwaukee Sentinel.
   Weakland said there are various definitions of pro-choice
opinion, ranging from abortion on demand to abortion for specific
reasons, and some personal decisions to have abortions might be
reconciled by the church. But that would be on a case-by-case
basis, he emphasized.
   ``I would have to see each one,'' he added. ``I don't know that
I would want to draw a line each time, as if outside this line you
are not in the Catholic Church. I think that is very dangerous.''
   Weakland's comments came just seven months after the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops _ the church's main governing body
in the United States _ issued a statement that ``no Catholic can
responsibly take a `pro-choice stand.'''
   Because he didn't address specific circumstances, it was unclear
how much Weakland's position differed from that of other church
leaders. Many Catholic theologians have said abortions in some
cases may be permitted to save the life of the mother.
   The Milwaukee archbishop's statement drew an immediate angry
response from one anti-abortion group that recommended he be
censured by the Vatican.
   ``I think he should stop dialoging and start teaching the
church's position and why abortion is always wrong and asks his
priests to do the same from their pulpits,'' said Mary Dietrich,
secretary of the Milwaukee chapter of Wisconsin Right to Life Inc.
   But Frances Kissling, national president of the Washington-based
pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice, praised Weakland's
statements as a ``real breakthrough.''
   ``I goes much further in acknowledging the political arena than
any other bishop has done to date,'' Ms. Kissling said. ``It gives
a lot of hope to Catholic politicians who have only been hearing
criticism.''
   Weakland over the weekend issued a 21-page statement on his
findings on women's view of abortions based on several
information-gathering meetings he had at churches in his diocese
earlier this year.
   Greg Bell, communications director for the Milwaukee
archdiocese, said the archbishop was meeting with priests Monday
and couldn't be interviewed. But he said Weakland didn't intend to
work against the church's anti-abortion stand or the statement made
by his U.S. colleagues in November.
   ``He doesn't want to juxtapose himself against the other
bishops,'' he said. ``He's not calling for redefinition of church
teaching.... What he is calling for is for the church to look more
closely at the root causes of why women choose abortions.''
   Bell said their may be instances in which, Weakland believes,
the church could understand why a women would have an abortion,
such as when such a woman's life is jeopardized.
   In the newspaper interview, Weakland acknowledged his position
was ``a bit aggressive'' but added he did not fear any reprimand
from the Vatican.

<TEXT>
   The commander of U.S. forces in the
Pacific said Tuesday he was optimistic U.S. and Philippine
officials would reach a new agreement providing for continued
American military presence in the Philippines.
   Last Friday, American and Philippine negotiators agreed to hold
further talks at an unspecified date on whether to renew a lease on
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations
that expires in September 1991.
   Rafael Alunan, spokesman for the Philippine panel, said the next
round could begin in three to four weeks.
   ``I am very optimistic that we will reach an agreement with
continued presence in the Philippines,'' Adm. Huntington Hardisty
told reporters after meeting Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus,
chief Philippine negotiator in the bases talks.
   Hardisty also said Philippine proposals for joint U.S.-Filipino
use of the bases was ``very feasible.'' The six bases are nominally
under Philippine command but effectively run by the Americans.
   The United States maintains about 40,000 troops, Defense
Department civilians and military dependents in the Philippines.
   Asked whether the United States would accept a reduced presence
under a new agreement, Hardisty said: ``I think we'll have a
reduced presence worldwide because of what's happening in Europe
and what's happening worldwide with our defense budget, but I also
think we'll maintain our forward presence.''
   On Monday, Hardisty met with President Corazon Aquino and
discussed the strategic relationship.
   ``From my personal opinion, I think our government feels very
comfortable with the recent exploratory talks,'' Hardisty said
after the meeting. ``I think both agree that our future depends on
a new relationship, a new strategic relationship.''
   Hardisty was in Manila to attend a regular meeting of the
U.S.-Philippine mutual defense board.
   After five days of talks last week, both sides agreed to
continue discussions despite differences, including Manila's claim
that Washington has failed to honor previous commitments on the
bases.
   Mrs. Aquino refuses to say whether she will support a new
agreement. Opposition to the bases is growing because many
Filipinos view them as an infringement on national sovereignty.
   On May 13, on the eve of the talks, Communist rebels opposed to
the bases killed two U.S. airmen near Clark Air Base.
   On Monday, Philippine police said the rebels also had planned to
assassinate senior U.S. military officers but the plots were foiled
when police began searching suspected rebel hideouts for the
killers of the two servicemen.
   On Friday, the Pentagon announced American diplomats and service
members in the Philippines would receive hazardous duty pay because
of the Communist threat.
   On Tuesday, police defused bombs outside the headquarters of two
banks in the financial district in Manila. Officials said the bombs
could have destroyed both buildings had they exploded.
   In another incident, assailants hurled three grenades at two
branches of the Security Branch and Trust Co., one of the banks
where the bombs were found. There were no injuries and only minor
damage in the attacks, police said.
   Police said they did not know who was responsible for the bombs
but the explosives were the same kind used by military mutineers in
December's coup attempt.

<HEAD>10 Killed in Battles Between Gunmen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HYDERABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen fought pitched battles in a
college campus and a populated neighborhood on Monday and 10 people
were killed and 34 wounded, officials said.
   Authorities clamped an indefinite curfew in two districts where
the clashes broke out and ordered police to shoot violators.
   At least 46 people have been killed and hundreds wounded in
shootings since May 15, authorities said.
   No group has claimed responsibility for the latest wave of
violence in Hyderabad, a city of 3 million in southern Sind
Province. But police blame a renegade faction of a militant Indian
immigrant party, the Mojahir Qami Movement.
   Supporters of the group, which represents Moslem immigrants from
India who entered Pakistan after the 1947 partition of the
subcontinent, are demanding recognition as a fifth nationality
along with the Baluch, Sindis, Pathans and Punjabis.
   In Karachi, capital of Sind and Pakistan's largest city, two
teen-agers were killed and four others injured in a shootout at a
local college that has come to resemble an armed camp, police said.
   The victims of Monday's shooting belonged to the People's
Student Federation, the student wing of Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, police said.
   They said supporters of the rival All Pakistan Mojahir Students
Organization opened fire with automatic weapons.
   In another incident on Monday, supporters of the Mojahir Qami
Movement opened fire on police trying to search the house of a
member of the group. Supporters of the group opened fire from their
houses and rooftops and the battle lasted for nearly two hours,
police said.
   It was unclear if Monday's eight other casualties were all from
that incident or if there were additional scattered clashes.
   In the capital of Islamabad, opposition parties said Bhutto's
17-month-old government has failed to restore law-and-order to her
home province and asked President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to declare a
state of emergency.
   Thousands of riot police, paramilitary troops and soldiers have
been patrolling the streets of Hyderabad on foot and in jeeps with
mounted machine guns but have failed to stop the shootings.
   Hyderabad and the port city of Karachi have been rocked in
recent years by ethnic violence that has claimed more than 2,000
lives.

<TEXT>
   In the heart of America, a team of book experts is on a special
mission, sifting through millions of dollars of treasures, trying
to write the final chapter in a mystery some feared never would be
solved.
   Their task is painstaking, their work daunting: to pore over
about 28,000 books and papers _ some rare and priceless, others
ordinary and worthless _ determine which are stolen, then match
them with their owners.
   Their work stems from the FBI's largest-ever seizure of stolen
rare books and manuscripts, a cache valued at up to $40 million,
all recovered this spring from one man's house in Iowa.
   While these library experts are figuring out what belongs to
whom, a bigger question looms: How?
   ``It would be interesting to know how somebody like this can go
into library after library, amassing so many books and it took so
long to put an end to this,'' said William Moffett, president of
the Association of College and Research Libraries.
   Stephen Carrie Blumberg, 41, who is undergoing psychiatric tests
at a Missouri prison hospital after being charged with theft, has a
long history of emotional problems and scrapes with the law. Over
the years, authorities have nabbed him with piles of books, found
him snooping in libraries, tracked and arrested him.
   But this is more than the tale of a troubled man.
   It's the story of how difficult it is to protect some of
America's cultural heritage, how hard-nosed cops know little about
the cloistered work of rare books, and how someone purportedly took
advantage of both weaknesses.
   ``This man apparently was quite brilliant,'' said Gary Menges,
head of the University of Washington's special collections and
preservation and chairman of the library association's rare books
security committee.
   ``He knows the system. He knows the way things work,'' said
Peter Briscoe, collection development officer at the University of
California-Riverside, where Blumberg was arrested in 1988.
``Libraries have done more and more to make things secure. Blumberg
seemed to be one step ahead.''
   An attorney who has known Blumberg and his family for years
disagrees.
   ``He's being portrayed as a master thief,'' said John Daubney, a
St. Paul, Minn., lawyer representing Blumberg in a case in that
state. ``This kid is totally incapable of doing this, physically,
mentally or otherwise. There's no question he apparently had some
books improperly taken ... (but) the great bulk of them were
purchased through legitimate means.
   ``He was more of a buyer than a seller. He was a collector,''
said Daubney, noting that Blumberg had an annual income of more
than $70,000 from family trusts.
   Blumberg, who has spent time in psychiatric hospitals, is a
soft-spoken loner who travels to flea markets in an old truck and
wears old clothes, Daubney said.
   He's fascinated by stained glass windows and door knobs and once
bought an old Minneapolis mansion, selling it at a $100,000 profit,
the attorney added.
   ``The kid is not stupid by any stretch,'' Daubney said. ``He
just thinks differently than the rest of us.''
   Blumberg's legal troubles date back more than 20 years, said
Steve Huntsberry, a corporal with the Washington State University
police who has tracked him as part of an investigation of rare book
thefts at the school.
   Blumberg's record includes a 1967 charge of stealing antique
doorknobs in Iowa and a 1974 accusation of theft in Colorado after
his car was found stuffed with books, Huntsberry said. The latter
case was dropped.
   In 1988, Blumberg, who used the alias of Matt McGue, was fined
and placed on probation after pleading guilty to trespassing and
possessing burglary tools in the closed rare-books section at
California-Riverside, authorities say.
   ``I knew he would get caught again somewhere,'' Huntsberry said.
``I just thought he would skate through it.''
   But on March 20, authorities raided Blumberg's house in Ottumwa,
Iowa, carting off 19 tons of books and papers in one 40-foot van
and a load of antiques in another.
   Dozens of library experts, including an eight-member team from a
group called Online Computer Library Center, which has a database
of 21 million titles, are helping the FBI identify and catalogue
the books and manuscripts, which are warehoused in an office
building in Omaha, Neb.
   ``This is unprecedented in the book world to get that much
attention from the authorities,'' said Jake Chernofsky, editor and
publisher of AB Bookman's Weekly, a publication for antiquarian
book dealers.
   The inventory should be computerized within four weeks, said W.
Dennis Aiken, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Omaha
office.
   ``When we first got into this, we thought it would be an
overwhelming, impossible task,'' he said. ``Very quickly, through
the outpouring of cooperation from the public and private literary
sector, it's becoming a very manageable task.''
   Aiken said tricks were played to conceal book owners; during the
raid, a trunk of bookplates, library cards and other identification
data was found.
   While some books are worthless, one is valued at $70,000 to
$90,000, Aiken said. The FBI said one expert estimated all the
volumes and papers could be worth up to $40 million.
   Authorities say they have found a Bible from 1480 and three
shelves of priceless materials from 1450-1500, an era known as the
incunabula, a period following the invention of the Gutenberg press.
   ``It was apparent that they had been chosen with great care,''
David Schoonover, University of Iowa rare books curator, said of
the nine rooms of floor-to-ceiling books he surveyed at Blumberg's
home.
   Aiken said that while the books and manuscripts come from 140
universities, the bulk are from about 10 schools. Some libraries,
he added, had no idea materials were missing.
   Other valuables also were seized in Minnesota, where Blumberg
was born and lived. Authorities searched three places in
Minneapolis and St. Paul, taking more than 300 stained glass
windows, gold coins, jewelry, silverware, door knobs, antiques and
other items.
   Police plan to show the public a videotape of them this week for
identification purposes.
   Daubney, however, said he has provided the FBI with more than
5,000 receipts _ often nothing more than little scraps ofpaper _
including some for stained glass windows and gold coins.
   The Blumberg case, some say, illustrates both the problems of
protecting rare books and investigating these thefts.
   Experts say rare book libraries have a delicate balancing act,
making collections accessible, yet secure.
   And police are novices in the area.
   ``It's not the average street creep we're dealing with,'' said
Sgt. Richard Hansen of the Eugene, Ore., police, who investigated
the loss of $662,500 worth of material, including 9,000 to 11,000
manuscripts, believed to have been taken from the University of
Oregon library in 1987.
   ``We don't have a network of contacts. ... It's absolutely fish
out of water,'' Hansen said. ``I had no idea of who's reliable,
who's not.''
   The librarians helping piece together the puzzle will make the
telling difference, Aiken said.
   ``We would not be able to do that without their expertise,'' he
said. ``My career would be over before this got done.''

   Despite a new civility campaign that implores,
``C'mon, New York, Ease Up,'' the inhabitants continue to hog pay
phones, fight over cabs, curse Jersey drivers and bump, elbow, knee
and shove each other.
   ``Courtesy? You got the wrong town, man,'' said Thomas Abato as
he tossed some change in the general direction of a newspaper
vendor.
   In a city where courtesy often seems limited to the ``It's Our
Pleasure to Serve You'' message on the blue and white cardboard
coffee containers, selling people on civility ``is the ultimate
marketing challenge,'' says Ron Burkhardt, whose advertising firm
is trying to do just that.
   The courtesy campaign is directed by a group called New York
Pride, which held a news conference Thursday to unveil an
advertising campaign.
   ``The city is in trouble, in crisis; it's aching now,'' said
co-chairman Herb Rickman, sounding as if maybe he should ease up
himself. ``Government alone can't save this city.''
   ``New York has become a rough, tough place to live in,'' he
added, ``largely because of little incidents, little irritations''
in the subway or on the street. Partly as a result, he said,
tourism is down and residents and corporations are moving out.
   The campaign attracted international attention when it was
announced at another news conference 2{ months ago, but until this
week little had actually been done to promote civility.
   The campaign includes:
   _Television spots showing typical New York scenes _ women
fighting over a taxi cab, men sticking fingers in each others'
chests, a bicyclist brushing past a pedestrian _ as the soundtrack
plays the song ``Try a Little Tenderness.'' At the end, two men
lift a fallen woman from the street.
   _Radio spots in which a grumpy bank teller tells a customer to
get in line. Asked ``Which line?'' he barks, ``See that short one
over there? That's not it.''
   _Print ads featuring a large close up of a cab driver's snarling
face and the message, ``It's about time we changed the face of New
York.''
   _Posters and window stickers with the quasi-trapazoidal ``NEW
YORK PR!DE'' logo, and the promise ``Courtesy Shown Here.''
   _A telephone line, 800-HAPPYNY, for reports of politeness or
courtesy. ``You can call up and find out who's being courteous and
who isn't,'' said Mark Simone of WNEW radio, who is focusing on the
topic on his program.
   A supermarket chain is giving free merchandise to any customer
who is not thanked by a check out cashier, a cab company is
training all its drivers in etiquette and Diamond District
merchants are displaying the courtesy posters in their store
windows.
   On Friday, however, New Yorkers were up to their old habits.
   They grumbled when they arrived at the Central Park tennis house
at 7 a.m. to discover the courts would not open on time because it
had rained the night before.
   They grumbled at dozens of subway stations along the J and M
lines after a shooting on a train halted service during rush hour.
   They grumbled at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 60th Street,
where pedestrian traffic was halted briefly when a blind man hooked
his cane through a woman's shopping bag, prompting some nasty
language by the latter.
   ``New Yorkers are cynical,'' said Emery Jackson, president of We
Care About New York, an agency which coordinates volunteers. ``I
don't blame New York Pride for trying, but I don't think public
service announcements will inspire them to be less curt.''
   Spokesmen for public service agencies were asked if the civility
campaign in having any effect.
   ``How could I possibly gauge such a thing?'' asked a harried Al
O'Leary, spokesman for the Transit Authority, who had a big meeting
Friday morning. ``Get real, babe. I gotta go.''
   ``People have been in a bad mood because of all the rain,'' said
Vito Turso, spokesman for the Sanitation Department. ``Try us next
week.''

<HEAD>Scientists Appeal for Dissident Fang Lizhi's Freedom</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS graf 7: ``Officials who,'' with report of Bush
decision</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   More than 200 scientists asked the Chinese
government Monday to allow dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li
Shuxian, to leave China and threatened to boycott scientific
conferences there until the human rights activists were free to
emigrate.
   The scientists, led by Soviet physicist Yuri Orlov, also urged
the U.S. government to put more pressure on China to permit the
Fangs to leave their refuge at the American Embassy without threat
of arrest.
   The Chinese government accused Fang, an astrophysicist and human
rights activist, of inciting the May 1989 pro-democracy
demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. He and Li, also a
scientist, fled to the U.S. Embassy.
   The two have refused to sign an ``admission of guilt'' for
responsibility for the demonstrations, which ended in a bloody
crackdown and martial law.
   ``We should try to push the opportunistic and insensitive U.S.
administration in the right direction,'' Orlov told a news
conference.
   President Bush must decide by June 3 whether to extend most
favored nation trading status to China. The administration is under
pressure from congressional Democrats and human rights activists to
deny the trading preference because of China's crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrations last year.
   Officials who asked not to be identified said Monday Bush had
decided to extend the favored trade status for another year.
   The appeal includes petitions signed by 224 prominent
scientists, including several Nobel laureates, to the Chinese
government through its Academy of Sciences and to Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, urging freedom for Fang and Li.
   ``As scientists dedicated to the truth and free inquiry, we
cannot remain silent while our colleagues in the People's Republic
of China are held captive because of their pursuit of these
ideals,'' the petitions said.
   The scientists also said they would encourage boycotts of
scientific conferences in China until the Fangs are released. Aryeh
Neier, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said 11 such
conferences were scheduled between May and September in China.
   Robert L. Park, chairman of the American Physical Society, said
discussions for new scientific conferences will not take place ``as
martial law persists and peaceful dissent is suppressed.''
   Fang's son, Fang Ke, a graduate physics student at Wayne State
University, said he has been in touch with his parents by mail.
``They have a good spirit, the kind of spirit Chinese people have,
especially of their generation,'' he said.

child-oriented radio stations, and others say the market is ripe
for such programming.
   ``Radio can be the storyteller that too often is missing from a
child's life. It makes you think,'' said Peggy Charren, president
of Action for Children's Television, a vigorous promoter of
children's radio programming.
   WWTC-AM, or Radio Aahs (pronounced Oz), made its debut May 12
with a broadcast from St. Paul's Como Zoo. So far, WWTC is the only
station in the Children's Radio Network.
   Two other radio networks for children are breaking ground in
Orlando, Fla., and Philadelphia.
   Radio Aahs airs educational songs, school news, fairy tales,
historical stories and re-creations of such old-time radio shows as
the ``Lone Ranger'' around the clock.
   ``It's pretty nice,'' said 5-year-old Gary Petersen. ``I don't
like rock 'n' roll stations. My mom turns it up too loud.''
   His mother, Patricia, is glad Gary and his 3-year-old brother,
Jarrod, feel a part of things. ``Mom has her radio station, Dad has
his radio station, and now they have theirs,'' she said.
   Emily Semsch, 6, likes that the station ``has more kid songs.
There's a song from school I know.''
   William Osewalt, president of Children's Radio Network, believes
that engaging the community is the key to the commercial venture's
success. He's thinking of children as guest DJs, broadcast
performances by school choirs and bands, and radio plays. Junior
journalists could also report on activities in their schools.
   ``There also will be the ones who go out and interview the
Herschel Walkers, other Vikings, the governor and the senators and
find out how legislation will affect them,'' Osewalt said.
   Osewalt formed Children's Radio Network in 1984, selling
programming to six stations around the country before getting out
of the business in 1986 for personal reasons.
   When he was ready to resume, he targeted the Twin Cities. Among
the reasons are its high per-capita spending on education and its
reputation as a traditional family base, he said.
   ``Like they say in show biz, if it doesn't work here, it won't
work anywhere,'' Osewalt said.
   The station has started with about 20 full-time employees, plus
volunteer advisers, such as St. Paul School Superintendent David
Bennett.
   Osewalt would not disclose the network's budget.
   Radio Aahs is a ``very nice alternative in a child's media
diet,'' said Richard Weinberg, director of the University of
Minnesota's Institute of Child Development in the College of
Education. ``Our kids live so much in a visual world. Returning to
an auditory world allows them to enhance their own imaginations.''
   In Florida, Kids' Choice Broadcasting Network has begun
marketing its network of satellite-delivered programs. Orlando
station WPRD-AM is the flagship station for the network, having
launched the children's format March 31.
   Kidwaves Radio Network of Philadelphia plans to launch its
all-children's programming June 1 at KIDZ-AM in Kansas City, Mo.,
said network President Mel Diamond.
   ``I think for the first time radio people are just waking up to
this segment,'' Diamond said. ``Our goal here at this network is to
raise their imagination levels, their creativity, and to ensure we
have a literate America.''
   The notion of an all-children's format on radio tantalizes L.
Roger Casty, executive vice president of CPM Inc., a Chicago media
management company that finds media for advertisers and agencies.
   ``It sounds like a wonderful idea. If I were the advertiser, I
would certainly look into it. It may be a very efficient way to
go,'' Casty said.

   A 29-year-old Eritrean battle for independence
from Ethiopia has become the longest war in Africa and one of the
world's most obscure, fought in a region where travel is difficult
and dangerous. An Associated Press correspondent spent nine days in
Eritrea. This is his report.

<DATELINE>AFABET, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just south of this neat town built of
rock and adobe are towers of sandstone boulders hundreds of feet
high, where the people take cover during daylight in case of
bombing raids.
   ``We cannot stay down there during the day,'' said Mariam
Teglest, 32, a soldier's widow with three children. ``It is much
too dangerous when the planes fly.''
   She was speaking of Soviet-built MiG fighter-bombers of the
Ethiopian air force, which had bombed the town of about 20,000
people twice in a few months.
   Afabet is one of a dozen or so major towns in Eritrea,
Ethiopia's northernmost province, where rebels have fought for
independence since 1961. Rebel forces captured the town in
February, early in their biggest offensive of the war.
   The conflict began 29 years ago as a small uprising by scattered
guerrilla bands and has grown into a toe-to-toe slugging match by
armies of thousands of soldiers armed with heavy artillery, tanks
and other modern weapons.
   It is a war the Eritreans appear on the verge of winning,
despite the Ethiopian military's total dominance of the sky and its
vast superiority in manpower. The government has a military force
of about 320,000 men, largest in black Africa.
   The Eritreans do not divulge the size of their army. The
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London says
30,000, but some recent visitors to the region believe the true
strength is double that or more.
   In three decades, the war has touched almost every part of this
barren, mountainous province the size of England.
   Afabet is tucked into a desert valley that evokes the American
Southwest. Here and elsewhere, people hide by day and work by night
in caves or camouflaged stone buildings and under the spreading
branches of the ubiquitous African thorn tree.
   ``We've created the world's largest underground economy,'' said
Haile Menkerios, a Harvard-educated economist, grinning at his play
on words. He is on the Central Committee of the rebel Eritrea
People's Liberation Front.
   ``We've learned not to expose ourselves,'' he said, with a sweep
of the arm that covered hills dotted with cave mouths and stone
huts almost undiscernible from a few yards.
   Eighty miles north of Afabet is Orota, the main rebel base camp.
It sprawls through a deep, narrow valley cross-hatched by canyons
and surrounded by rugged peaks so high the sun reaches in for only
a few hours a day.
   Enemy planes fly into this maze at great peril.
   Orota is a supply and military training base, site of a
detention center for thousands of prisoners of war, a civilian and
an army hospital, schools for children of soldiers, manufacturing
plants and repair shops for trucks, tanks and other military
vehicles.
   The hospitals stretch for three miles down the main valley, to
reduce the threat from bombing. Wards and operating theaters are
hidden in tents under thorn trees, in caves and in nearly invisible
buildings hewn from the same sandstone as the surrounding mountains.
   ``I think Frank Lloyd Wright would be proud of us,'' said
Menkerios, grinning again at his reference to the architect who
believed buildings should harmonize with their natural surroundings.
   A pharmaceutical factory, hidden in caves, makes everything from
saline solutions to malaria pills and sanitary pads for women.
   One in four rebel soldiers is a woman, many of them commanders
in an army with no ranks or sex discrimination.
   Everything in Orota is powered by electrical generators, most of
which are cranked up only after sundown, when the vast camp stirs
to life.
   Soviet-made field telephones captured from the Ethiopians
connect the scattered complex. They look like early Edison models,
but they work.
   Nearly everything is captured, scavenged, donated or handmade by
a people used to getting by on next to nothing. This province on
the Red Sea is one of the poorest in one of the world's poorest
nations.
   Nothing is thrown away. Artillery shell casings filled with sand
and welded together form the supporting pillars of a new school.
Disposable hypodermic syringes become light switches. Old tractor
and truck tires are turned into wash troughs.
   The Eritreans claim that they do not have the support of foreign
governments and that all their military hardware, from tanks to
Kalashnikov assault rifles, has been captured from the Ethiopian
army.
   Officials and some diplomats in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital,
say the Eritreans have received arms and money from several Arab
countries around the Red Sea that oppose the Soviet-supplied
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. Eritrea's population
is split about 50-50 between Moslems and Christians.
   A few reporters allowed behind rebel lines in recent months saw
nothing but old and often battered Soviet-made military equipment.
   Nothing in Orota except the crowded hospitals suggests the huge
battles being waged around Asmara, the Eritrean capital, a 16-hour
drive south over rutted trails even experienced drivers can lose in
the dark.
   On a roughly north-south line running nearly 100 miles betweem
Asmara and the sea, the rebels are fighting more than a third of
Ethiopia's armed forces, mostly conscripted and poorly trained
young men.
   At the beginning of their February offensive, the rebels
surrounded and cut off Asmara, including an estimated 1 million
civilians and the government's 120,000-man 2nd Revolutionary Army.
   Three times since early April, the 2nd Army pushed eastward in
an attempt to recapture its nearest outlet to safety, the Red Sea
port of Massawa. Each time, an Eritrean force no more than half the
size stopped it cold.
   Reporters who visited Massawa in late April could hear the
thunder of artillery and tank barrages day and night at the front
40 miles away. The fierce exchanges often made windows rattle.
   The rebels claim they killed, wounded or captured 30,000
Ethiopian soldiers when they took Massawa in a three-day battle in
early February and have inflicted similar casualties along the
Ghinda front.
   Journalists who have seen the remains of Massawa, been guided
near the front by the rebels and talked with deserters from
Mengistu's army believe the numbers are not greatly exaggerated.
   Whatever the number of dead and wounded on either side, the
Ethiopian 2nd Army's inability to break out of Asmara illustrates
the rebels' military prowess.
   Most of Mengistu's other forces are occupied far to the south in
the neighboring provinces of Tigre, Wollo and Gonder with an
uprising by the smaller Tigre People's Liberation Front.
   The Tigreans, known to coordinate military moves with the
Eritreans, have spent 15 years fighting to overthrow Mengistu and
establish a new national government.
   Eritrean fighters and their leaders predict the long war will
end in a few months.
   ``Come back soon,'' said Asmellash Abraha, who was detached from
other duties to play host to three visting journalists. ``I'll show
you Asmara. I am anxious to see it myself. It's been a long, long
time since I was last there.''

   President Mengistu Haile Mariam,
who built a Marxist regime on the ashes of a feudal empire he
helped bring down in 1974, is a man with many problems and, some
predict, a limited future.
   His army has suffered battlefield setbacks in recent months,
particularly in the northernmost province of Eritrea, where rebels
appear on the verge of winning a 29-year-old war for independence.
   Another insurgent group swept out of its stronghold in Tigre
Province, just south of Eritrea, 10 months ago and has pressed its
fight to overthrow Mengistu's government to within 50 miles of the
capital.
   The Soviet Union, preoccupied with its own economic and
political problems, has threatened to close the tap that has poured
billions of dollars worth of military hardware into Ethiopia since
1977.
   Mengistu spurned the United States and its Western allies when
he achieved power 13 years ago, and they are in no hurry to improve
relations.
   Major elements of Mengistu's own army attempted a coup last
year. He said in a recent speech he had survived nine assassination
attempts.
   With all those problems, and burdened by a collapsing economy
that has never been robust, Mengistu signaled a change of course
two months ago. From now on, Ethiopia will favor free-market
economics and welcome foreign investment, he said.
   Giant posters of Marx and Lenin came down in Addis Ababa, but
those showing Mengistu in various poses as a revered leader remain.
   ``It looks like a deathbed conversion,'' a Western diplomat in
Addis Ababa said, on condition of anonymity. ``If you believe that
Mengistu has had a true change of heart, you probably also believe
in the Easter bunny.''
   Mengistu joined other army officers in 1974, when he was a
major, in overthrowing Emperor Haile Selassie. Three years later,
he reigned supreme.
   He created the Marxist-Leninist Workers Party of Ethiopia in
1984. In 1987, Mengistu established the People's Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia, formally dropping his military rank of
lieutenant colonel to become a civilian president.
   Ethiopia is ruled by a small group agreeable to Mengistu's every
plan, according to the memoirs of Dawit Wolde Giorgis, a former
member of the party Central Committee who defected to the West.
   Dawit, major human rights groups and other critics accuse
Mengistu of ordering or participating in the executions of dozens
of rivals and of imprisoning thousands. Mengistu has denied the
claims.

   Peace talks aimed at ending nearly three
decades of war between Eritrean rebels and the Ethiopian government
are stalled and unlikely to resume.
   Preliminary discussions, with former President Jimmy Carter as
chairman, began in Atlanta last September and moved to Nairobi, the
capital of Kenya, two months later.
   Negotiations in Nairobi ended with the government and rebel
delegations clearly at odds, but agreeing to continue talks under
the joint mediation of Carter and Julius Nyerere, former president
of Tanzania.
   A third round was tentatively scheduled for early March in
Nairobi, but foundered on a dispute over whether the United Nations
should send an observer.
   Eritrean rebels see U.N. participation as de facto recognition
of their movement, which controls 80 percent of the Eritrean
countryside. President Mengistu Haile Mariam's government opposes
it for the same reason.
   Carter invited the United Nations to take part, on behalf of the
rebels, and said his offer was rejected.
   Rebel leaders said the invitation should have been sent jointly
by them and the representatives of Mengistu's government and
accused Carter of double-dealing, which the former president denied.
   ``The issue will ultimately go to the United Nations,'' Ali
Sayed Abdalla, foreign minister of the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front, said in an interview. ``The U.N. must guarantee any accord,
so why not agree to have it represented as an observer at the peace
talks?''
   A Western diplomat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, said: ``I
see absolutely no chance for a resumption. The military situation
has changed radically since September and the government seems to
be reeling. I suspect the EPLF feels it can stand pat on its
demands.''

<TEXT>
   India is moving tens of thousands of
battle-ready soldiers to its border with Pakistan, prompting fear
among Western diplomats of another war over Kashmir.
   Western military experts say India also is seeking to buy large
quantities of movable bridges, troop transport boats and other
equipment that could be used in an attack.
   In addition, the government recently formed a paramilitary unit
called the National Rifles, which could undertake counterinsurgency
operations in the troubled state of Jammu-Kashmir, freeing the army
to go to the border.
   Interviews with military experts from the West and Asia
indicated several countries were seriously considering the
possibility of war between India and Pakistan. One Western officer
said his embassy was discussing contingency plans for withdraal of
embassy personnel and their families.
   A month ago, many of the same officers said war was impossible.
   ``We've changed our assessment,'' a high-ranking Western officer
said. ``We think there now is a 50-50 chance.''
   Experts say the developments are doubly disturbing because both
countries are believed to possess nuclear weapons technology. India
exploded a nuclear device in 1974.
   Both also have medium-range missiles.
   The focus of the problem is Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state
with a Moslem majority.
   Both nations claim the scenic region of valleys and Himalayan
mountains and have fought two wars over it since winning
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Nearly 400 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir since the
Indian government began a crackdown on Moslem separatists Jan. 20.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming the insurgents and training
them in camps across the border. Pakistan claims to provide only
moral support.
   Western military officers said several developments contributed
to their changed attitude about the possibility of war.
   Rhetoric has grown hotter on both sides.
   In April, Prime Minister V.P. Singh of India told his countrymen
to be ``psychologically prepared'' for war. Right-wing groups in
India have called for limited military strikes into Pakistan.
   Pakistan's prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has told the Kashmiri
separatists ``your blood is our blood.''
   Both countries, especially India, appear to be backing up their
words with action.
   India has undertaken a ``slow but steady'' buildup of forces
along its entire border with Pakistan, military experts say.
   In the last month, the 57th and 8th divisions, totaling about
20,000 men, were moved from the northeast frontier with China to
Kashmir, according to two Western experts. Like the others, they
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Military officers said India would not have shifted troops from
one sensitive region to another without an ``express purpose.''
   India lost a war with China in 1962. Although tensions have
eased between the countries, New Delhi still regards Beijing as a
threat.
   Western experts say deployment of the paramilitary National
Rifles, commanded by an army lieutenant general, will allow army
troops in the Kashmir Valley take positions along the border, both
in Kashmir and farther south.
   They say India is strengthening its border forces in Rajasthan
and Punjab states, on the flat plain that stretches into the heart
of Pakistan.
   The Pakistanis appear to have done less actual preparation for
war, but have put border regions on alert. The Western experts say
they found it ``highly disturbing'' that Pakistan had followed
regularly scheduled battlefield exercises with another series.
   During the next few months, the experts said, they believe India
will try to seal the Kashmir front to prevent Moslem militants from
sneaking through the high mountain passes when the snow melts.
   ``They will crack down hard in the valley'' during the hot
summer and the rainy season, one officer said.
   If the separatist struggle continues in September, Western
officers say, India might be tempted to launch an air strike at the
alleged training camps in Pakistan.
   They said India probably would seek to maintain the status quo
in Kashmir against Pakistani retaliation and attack on the ground
from Rajasthan or Punjab.
   India's goal would be to seize as much territory as possible
before negotiations began, they said.
   A government-financed think tank has come out in favor of
limited strikes against Pakistan.
   The Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, citing Western
precedents, said in its latest paper: ``India has every right to
retaliate against the bases of terrorism and the country that
sponsors the terrorism.''
   But one good sign for peace is that many in the Indian military
do not appear to want a war.
   The army has just finished a difficult 30-month peacekeeping
operation in Sri Lanka, where it lost more than 1,100 men to
attacks by Tamil guerrillas. Indian officers have been quoted as
saying their economically strapped nation cannot afford a war,
which would cost an estimated $4.7 million a day.

today after being seriously injured in an auto accident.
   The 47-year-old Durham, who had such hits as ``Georgy Girl'' and
``I Will Never Find Another You,'' was resting comfortably after
surgery for fractures of the leg, arms and collarbone, an Alfred

   Joan Collins was to have starred in a film
version of her 1988 novel ``Prime Time,'' but Ion Pictures say it
has abandoned the project because she tinkered with the script and
ran up huge expenses.
   Co-producer Roy Medawar said Ms. Collins, 57, charged $40,000
worth of clothes to the movie without approval and ``made script
changes without telling the director.''
   Medawar said in the May 20 issue of People magazine that Ms.
Collins also turned down Jacqueline Bisset and Ann-Margret as
potential co-stars ``because she wanted to be the biggest name in
the movie.''
   The actress' agent, Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar, confirmed that the
project has been shelved but told the magazine that ``it wasn't
Joan's fault. She wasn't greedy. The producers defaulted on her
$300,000 salary.''
   ``They're amateurs, and they never came up with the money,''
Lazar added.

   BUCKEYE, La. (AP) _ Kim Marler is honored that Ronald Reagan
wants her 19 scrapbooks for his presidential library, but she's not
sure whether to donate or loan them.
   The high school senior showed Reagan and his wife, Nancy, the
scrapbooks of his presidency when he came to Baton Rouge last week
to give a commencement speech at Louisiana State University.
   ``I was nervous at first, and then I kind of got relaxed,'' she
said. ``They were normal people just like me.''
   She said Reagan told her the scrapbooks would be a valuable
contribution to his library, now under construction in California.
   ``I'd like to have him have them in his library,'' said Miss
Marler. ``But I worked on this for nine years, so I don't want to
just give them up.''
   Miss Marler said Reagan, his interest piqued by the stories and
photographs in the scrapbooks, talked at length about the attempt
on his life in 1981.
   ``He talked about how the bullet entered him. When he got to the
hospital, he could hardly walk. His suit was brand new, and they
had to cut if off him,'' she said.

   Police say they are
investigating allegations that satanic cults sacrificed as many as
11 children in recent years as part of devil-worshiping rituals.
   Several people who identified themselves as former members of
satanic cults told of incidents in which babies were bred for the
purpose of the ritual murders, a police captain was quoted as
telling Sunday newspapers.
   The ex-cultists told Police Capt. Leonard Solms they knew of 11
instances of child sacrifice in the past five years, the newspapers
said.
   They alleged the satanic groups also engaged in sexual acts with
children and killed animals, Solms said.
   Police said Sunday they have been investigating the allegations
for months, but no arrests have been made. They said the alleged
incidents described by the ex-cultists took place in the Cape Town
area.

   In South Florida, money can buy the weaponry of
your choice, whether it's anti-aircraft missiles, plastic
explosives or drone bombers, authorities say.
   The region is considered one of the world's best-equipped
bazaars for black-market weapons of war, a rendezvous where
guerrilla groups, narco-terrorists and other underworld elements
seek ever more sophisticated firepower.
   Colombia's drug cartels, their jungle cocaine labs and
clandestine airstrips under assault from fighter bombers and
helicopter gunships, appear to be the latest big shoppers for
shoulder-borne Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.
   In an undercover operation May 5, a narco-terrorism task force
based in Miami arrested two Colombians allegedly seeking to buy 120
Stingers and 50 automatic rifles for Pablo Escobar Gaviria, kingpin
of the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   The defendants remain jailed without bond. No trial date has
been set.
   It was the first acknowledged coup for the task force, which was
formed in September from 14 federal, state and county law
enforcement agencies.
   The reasons given for the Miami area's role in the arms trade
include its proximity to Latin America's drug network, the vast
amounts of Latin wealth in Miami banks and available for use, and
the region's busy seaports and airports, which make it easier for
criminals to move unnoticed.
   Firearms customers come from all quarters.
   Authorities suspect the Irish Republican Army, not a regular
customer in the region, was in the market for a Stinger in West
Palm Beach in January.
   Authorities here also have investigated purchases of a pilotless
drone bomber, anti-tank TOW missiles, rockets and plastic
explosives.
   ``South Florida is on the national scale and internationally
seen as a tremendous gateway for munitions. That's just an accepted
fact,'' said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   ``Here it's just a matter of money, really. In general, if you
have the money, you can buy pretty much what you want. ... Every
type of evil deed that you want to do you can do here.''
   William Gavin, agent in charge of the FBI in Miami, said it's
difficult to gauge how many such transactions are going on.
   The enforcement response includes Operation Exodus, a Customs
program begun in 1981 to target illegal exports of high-tech
equipment and munitions.
   ``With the activities and the crackdown by the government of
Colombia, certainly the interest in heavy weaponry _ military type
_ has increased,'' said Bob Creighton, head of the Miami office of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``They are interested
in high-quality firepower.''
   Hampshire College professor Michael Klare, an expert on the arms
trade, says that while law enforcement efforts to stem arms dealing
are more vigorous in the United States than in many other
countries, the issue gets low priority.
   ``The main priority for our Customs offices is preventing entry
into the United States of drugs, and understandably this has become
the national priority,'' Klare said. ``But it means there isn't the
resources and personnel to work on watching the egress from this
country of weapons.''
   Since drug smuggling requires a round-trip for the transporters,
the return leg is open for innovation.
   ``Everybody talks about these planes and trucks coming in
because we worry about the contraband,'' Klare said. ``Nobody asks
what they do when they leave. We just assume they leave empty. The
fact is that they are carrying out weapons on many occasions, and
we just don't make it a priority.''

   Help Mr. Wizard, a dripping one-pound
amphibian with a soaring soul, beat back a challenge by a trio of
African Goliath frogs to win the 1990 Jumping Frog Jubilee on
Sunday.
   Wizard, owned by Gregg Jaschek of Concord, Calif., leaped 19
feet, 3 inches, besting 72 other finalists in the 62nd annual event
that drew a capacity crowd of 8,000 to this Calaveras County hamlet.
   ``It was just luck. I've been trying for 19 years and if I knew
the secret of winning I would have won long before this,'' Jaschek
said, kissing his frog as friends poured champagne on him.
   Three African Goliaths, owned by Seattle, Wash., animal
collector Andy Koffman, fizzled in the colorful event _
disqualified because they couldn't fit on the starting pad or
simply couldn't jump far enough. But after the meet, Koffman
declared, ``I'll be back.''
   Jaschek, an automotive parts clerk who took home the $500
first-place prize, said he captured Help Mr. Wizard in the San
Joaquin Valley.
   ``I wasn't afraid of the African frogs,'' he said. ``I saw them
on TV. They weren't so hot.''
   Second place went to an 18-foot, 4-inch leap by a frog named Cho
Cho and third place was won by Jumpin' Jack.
   Two of the huge frogs _ dubbed ``Goliaths'' _ won the right to
compete in the finals, but the best of their leaps in qualifying
rounds fell far short of the world record. Koffman's Goliaths get
as big as 15 pounds, but the contestants Sunday weighed in at an
estimated three pounds each.
   The big frogs' entry has been the focus of the build-up for the
colorful contest, inspired by Mark Twain's gold rush era short
story about a frog that failed to jump because its belly was filled
with shot. Media reports about the giant foreign challengers
swelled attendance.
   Before the meet, Koffman, who keeps the frogs in a 1,500-gallon
tank in his basement, had predicted his frogs would easily shatter
the contest record. That is held by one-pound Rosie the Ribiter,
who in 1985 covered 21 feet, 5} inches in the three hops allowed by
contest rules.
   On Saturday, Koffman said one of his jumpers, Hoppy, leaped a
record 21 feet, 9{ inches, which he videotaped, but it was outside
competition.
   He blamed their lackluster showing on the difficulty of
squeezing them onto the 9-inch-diameter starting pad. ``They just
kind of slip out of my hands and it slows them down,'' he said.
   The big frogs also leaped at an angle and made little stutter
hops after landing, keeping down their distance. Under contest
rules, the distance is measured as the total of three successive
hops.
   In one early qualifying event, an African Goliath frog named
Johnny Carson jumped 12 feet, 4} inches, enough to win the round
for the International Association of Fairs round, but only 4{
inches farther than the runner-up, Ohio Hopper.
   Another Koffman frog named Sue decisively won the Media Jump
with a leap of 13 feet, 5 inches, while a third African frog, Jay
Leno, finished fifth in the Western Association of Fairs jump.
   There was some controversy, with detractors claiming the huge
frogs from Cameroon had an unfair advantage over local amphibians.
Other local frog jump boosters welcomed the burly outsiders _ and
the attention they brought.
   The big frogs are listed on California's ``dangerous animals''
register, and required special exemptions to be allowed into the
state.

<TEXT>
   A Moslem secessionist movement in
India's troubled state of Jammu-Kashmir has become a mixed blessing
for Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of neighboring Pakistan.
   It has enabled her to brighten her image at home and silence a
hostile opposition, but it could backfire after today's legislative
elections in Azad (Free) Kashmir, Pakistan's part of the disputed
territory.
   If Ms. Bhutto's left-of-center Pakistan People's Party wins,
analysts say, she will be faced either with arming the Kashmiris
who cross the border demanding military help or dealing with
opposition protests.
   She ``will have to agree to a limited war to pacify Kashmiris or
have no control over Kashmir,'' said Abdul Shaheen, an official in
the Azad Kashmir government.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
Kashmir, and there are reports of preparations for another.
   The main opponent of Ms. Bhutto's party in Pakistani Kashmir is
the All Azad Kashmir Moslem Conference, a right-wing religious
party that controls the 48-seat state assembly.
   Militant secessionists in Indian-held Kashmir have been waving
the Islamic banner and Moslem fundamentalists in Pakistan have
pressed for the government to act, but the prime minister has
refused. Jammu-Kashmir is the only state with a Moslem majority in
India, which is overwhelmingly Hindu.
   Although Ms. Bhutto has not taken a personal hand in the Azad
Kashmir election, The Pakistan People's Party has gained a rich
Islamic flavor from her current tour of Iran, Syria, Turkey Jordan,
North Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. All are members of the
Organization of Islamic Conference.
   Two weeks ago, political observers in this tranquil mountain
city of 300,000 would not have given her party a chance. Now, one
said, ``they're definitely in the running.''
   The Pakistan People's Party has no seats in the state assembly
because it boycotted the 1985 elections to protest the military
regime of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   Abdul Qayyum, president of Azad Kashmir and leader of the Moslem
Conference party, was a close ally of Zia, who died in a plane
crash in August 1988. Mrs. Bhutto's party won the democratic
election held later that year and she became the first woman to
lead a modern Moslem nation.
   Abroad, Ms. Bhutto appeared a heroine who restored democracy to
her developing nation.
   But many at home saw her as a weak leader paralyzed by
compromise, incompetence and corruption. That perception began
changing in January after India cracked down on Moslem separatists
in Jammu-Kashmir. Nearly 400 people have been killed.
   Ms. Bhutto aimed biting, impassioned rhetoric at India, saying
saying to the Kashmiri separatists at one point: ``Your blood is
our blood.'' Her promises of ``1,000 years of war'' for what she
calls Moslem ``freedom fighters'' pre-empted the political
opposition.
   Pakistan and India fought wars over Kashmir in 1948 and 1965,
and went to war a third time in 1971 over East Pakistan, which
became Bangladesh as a result.
   Kashmir, a former princely state, was divided between the two
countries in 1947, when the subcontinent was partitioned and they
became independent of Britain.
   India has accused Pakistan of arming, training and harboring the
Jammu-Kashmir separatists. Pakistan denies the allegations but says
it supports the right of Kashmiris to self-determination.
   The rhetoric has subsided in recent weeks, but skirmishes occur
periodically along the U.N.-monitored truce line, where soldiers of
the two nations face each other.
   Azad Kashmir has a special status in Pakistan, with its own
constitution, president and prime minister. The central
government's jurisdiction is limited to foreign policy, defense and
currency.
   Today's state election will the third since independence.
   Justice Ashraf Khan, chief election commissioner, said 235
candidates were contesting 40 assembly seats, most as independents.
None are women, although there are no restrictions on female
candidates.
   The remaining eight seats will be filled by the new assembly and
divided among women, refugees and expatriates.

   Queen Elizabeth II, believed to be the world's
richest woman, grumbles about the price she has to pay for her
clothes and is happier wearing a pair of comfortable old shoes,
according to her favorite couturier.
   Sir Hardy Amies says in the May 23 issue of the Woman's Own
weekly that the queen is not a ``clothes person.''
   The designer, who will be 81 in July, is Dressmaker by
Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen, a title granted by Buckingham
Palace.
   ``She grumbles about our prices, drops hints and things, but she
has been told ... that those are the prices,'' Amies said.
   He said the queen often ignores his advice.
   ``She doesn't care, basically. She listens to our advice, then
goes off and wears shabby shoes because they're comfortable.
   ``In my opinion that is perfectly all right. It's only the hoi
polloi who criticize,'' he said.
   Princess Anne, the queen's daughter, ``won't pay our prices and
she's happy with the way she dresses,'' said Amies.

   A fire broke out in a laboratory of Nobel
Prize-winning scientists at a medical school Sunday night, forcing
evacuations and releasing some hazardous material, authorities said.
   Initial reports that radioactive substances were released at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center turned out to be
false, said Chief Mike Zak of the Dallas Fire Department, although
such materials are used in the lab.
   Zak said radioactive materials were used in the lab but weren't
released when the fire began shortly after 8 p.m.
   Twelve firefighters were taken to an adjacent hospital for
observation in a precautionary measure because they may have been
exposed to the hazardous chemical hydrazine.
   Firefighters extinguished the fire on the fifth floor of the
medical center an hour after it started, Zak said. Several people
were evacuated.
   Fire officials said the blaze originated in one of several labs
run by Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein, who won the 1985
Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries related to cholesterol
metabolism and cholesterol-related diseases.
   The blaze released undetermined amounts of hydrazine, a
corrosive and flammable compound that can be fatal if inhaled,
ingested or absorbed through skin, Zak said.

   Few colleges or universities are taking all the steps experts
believe are needed to stamp out campus racism.
   Many schools have established committees to address bigotry.
Others have offered special scholarships and stepped up recruiting
of minority students and faculty. Still others are requiring
students to take courses about racism or minority issues or attend
orientation sessions on race relations.
   But a spot check of schools around the country by The Associated
Press found only a handful taking the comprehensive approach
experts feel is necessary to quell the recent rise in campus
bigotry.
   ``My greatest criticism of these efforts is that, although they
are often genuine, they tend to be piecemeal, not comprehensive. In
many instances, campuses that have racial incidents rush to do
something immediately to fill a gap,'' said Reginald Wilson, senior
scholar at the American Council on Education and an authority on
campus race relations.
   He and others said the fault often lies at the top _ with
college presidents who fail to take the lead in combating racism or
even recognize it as a serious problem.
   ``It has to start from the top with policy statements that
racism and the other `isms' won't be tolerated,'' said Barry
Beckham, a former English professor at Hampton University in
Virginia who started a bi-monthly national newsletter this year,
``The Black Student Advisor.''
   About one-quarter of the nation's college presidents consider
racism a problem on their campus, according to a study published
last month by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching. Too many campuses have ``sought to sidestep rather than
confront the issue,'' that report concluded.
   Administrators at the University of Texas-Austin came in for
criticism last month when two fraternities painted racial epithets
on a car and sold T-shirts with a ``Sambo'' caricature.
   ``I am embarrassed to be associated with an institution that
hasn't addressed the issue more strongly that it has,'' women's
basketball coach Jody Conradt said.
   The University of Oregon in Eugene last year strengthened its
student conduct code prohibiting racial harassment. It also
required students to take a course in race or gender studies.
   But Andy Clark, a black senior who is student body president,
said courses he's taken on black women writers, black power in the
Civil Rights movement, and race, class and ethnic groups in the
United States were all taught by whites.
   Earlier this month, University of Washington President William
Gerberding made remarks at a banquet disparaging to a Mexican-born
student. Gerberding apologized and agreed to take a racial
sensitivity course.
   Black Student Union president Michelle Gordon called the Seattle
campus ``very racist. The tension is real high here.''
   At Indiana Uiversity, assistant dean of students Pamela Freeman
said several committees formed to deal with racism have helped ease
tensions on campus. But last year, the offices of the university's
president, Thomas Ehrlich, who is Jewish, and Michael Gordon, the
dean of student affairs, who is black, were spray-painted with
anti-Semitic and anti-black slogans.
   On the other hand, ACE's Wilson and others praise University of
Michigan president James J. Duderstadt for taking effective and
wide-ranging actions to improve relations at one of the nation's
more racially torn campuses.
   Duderstadt named a vice provost for minority affairs, invested
nearly $4 million in the Center for Afro-American and African
Studies and boosted the budget for attracting minority faculty.
Duderstadt has also developed a ``Michigan Mandate,'' a yearly
blueprint for increasing campus diversity.
   Next fall for the first time, the school will offer an
interdisciplinary course on racism.
   The result: minority enrollment is up 25.6 percent since 1987,
and the school has hired 76 additional minority faculty members.
Applications by black students for next fall's freshman class
increased 26 percent.
   Other colleges battling racism have met resistance.
   University of Wisconsin officials say they have fewer racial
incidents with the help of a 3-year-old plan called ``design for
diversity,'' providing for the recruitment and retention of
minority faculty and students as well as mentor programs for
minorities.
   But the school has run afoul of the American Civil Liberties
Union for adopting a rule prohibiting ``comments, epithets or other
expressive behavior directed at an individual'' if it demeans the
person's race, sex, religion, color, creed, disability, sexual
orientation, national origin, ancestry or age, or creates a hostile
environment on campus.
   Some white students at the University of Texas felt unfairly
targeted at campus demonstrations last month.
   ``As a heterosexual white male, I feel like there's going to be
a rally against me out here, even though I personally have not done
anything,'' said Mark Bunger.
   A columnist for Vanderbilt University's student paper sparked a
war of words in March by calling the school's minority recruitment
efforts reverse discrimination and accusing the campus black
cultural center of perpetuating racism.
   ``While some students may wish that some special programs were
not in place, Vanderbilt has established diversity as a goal,''
Vanderbilt Provost Charles Kiesler said.

   The first photo series from the Hubble
Space Telescope was supposed to be just an engineering test, but it
surprised scientists by revealing an unsuspected double star.
   Hubble's inaugural photo sequence, taken from its orbit 381
miles above the Earth, showed bright, crisp stars against a black
background, with much clearer images than seen in a picture taken
by a ground-based telescope of the same part of the heavens.
   ``Fantastic,'' James Westphal, the principal scientist for the
camera used in the first photo exercise, said Sunday. ``We are just
as pleased as punch at this point. Our image is significantly
better than we were concerned that it might be.''
   Westphal said the Hubble pictures clearly show that an image
which appeared in ground-based photos to be only a single star was,
in fact, a rare binary star. The space telescope pictures showed
two overlapping points of light, instead of a single blob as seen
in a picture taken by a Chilean observatory.
   ``We didn't know it was a double star,'' said Westphal.
   NASA officials had said Hubble's initial images would be only
``an engineering test'' that was being used to meet the ceremonial
requirements for the ``first light'' pictures that are traditional
for a new telescope.
   But a delighted Westphal said the pictures were worthy of
serious study.
   ``Boy, we could get lots of science out of this right now,'' he
said.
   Lennard Fisk, the associate administrator for science at NASA,
said the quality of the pictures proved the design and testing of
the costly telescope.
   ``I'm delighted,'' he said. ``It's two times better than we
thought it would be.''
   The quality of the photos brought cheers from National
Aeronautics and Space Administration engineers who have had to
solve a series of problems with the telescope since it was launched
last month by a space shuttle.
   Hubble's troubles have included a fouled antenna, a computer
program that caused instruments to shut down, another computer
program that contained a math error that affected pointing
accuracy, and a satellite jitter that experts still find
troublesome.
   Jean Olivier, deputy project manager for the Hubble, said that
the first light pictures are only a ``coarse-focused'' image of
what the space telescope eventually will achieve. He said there
still are weeks remaining in an elaborate focusing checkout of the
instruments.
   ``We're only about a fourth of the way through the whole
focusing process,'' he said.
   The planned scientific studies will not start until the
engineers have completed the checkout, which may take months.
   Eventually, Hubble is expected to produce pictures seven times
clearer than the images captured on Sunday.
   Engineers started the ``first light'' sequence before noon
Sunday by sending programmed instructions to Hubble.
   The telescope satellite moved to point directly at the target
stars. Then a wide-angle camera opened its shutter for a one-second
exposure and then for a 30-second exposure. The images from the
camera were recorded on board as 10 million bits of data. At 1:49
p.m., the data were sent through a relay satellite to computers at
the Goddard Space Flight Center.
   While a crowd of engineers, scientists and journalists watched
on television, Hubble engineers processed the data through a
computer that assembled a photo.
   At first, the raw images showed a mass of streaks and white dots
against a field of gray. But the picture became sharper and sharper
as a computer removed stray signals and then brightened the points
of light.
   Eventually, the picture was narrowed to a small segment of the
sky. It showed the bright double star along with eight other bright
stars.
   A photo taken by the Las Capanas Observatory in Chile of the
same area of the sky was able to capture only four bright stars and
the double star was blurred into a single image.
   The target for Hubble's first image was a star cluster called
Theta Carina, a group of objects about 1,260 light-years from
Earth. The target star field is visible from Earth only in the
southern hemisphere.
   Hubble, by working from an orbit above the obscuring effects of
the Earth's atmosphere, is able to look at stars with 10 times the
clarity of the views achieved by ground telescopes.
   NASA engineers believe that eventually the space telescope will
be able to photograph stars that are 25 times fainter than the
dimmest object visible from Earth, and see stars that may be up to
14 billion light-years from Earth.

   After the Kremlin embargoed shipments
of oil and gas to secessionist Lithuania, factory director Jouri
Sivicki had to lay off 60 workers.
   ``Then we found a way to change our energy supply from gas to
electricity and we took (the workers) back,'' Sivicki said, sitting
behind the wide desk in his paneled office at the Zhalgris
machine-tool plant.
   His common-sense response to the Soviet blockade is typical in
this Baltic republic, which declared independence March 11.
   Residents of the capital and its suburbs, interviewed last week,
said they had plenty of food but were running out of gasoline.
   An estimated 12,000 people are unemployed because of the energy
shortage. Vytautas Landsbergis, president of Lithuania, has said
more factories will close soon.
   The city did not meet its payday for teachers last week, said a
teacher who would identify herself only as Natasha.
   Vytautas Morkunas, waiting in line to buy laundry detergent with
ration coupons, said: ``Of course it was easier before, but I
support independence.''
   Other rationed goods include gasoline, flour, macaroni and sugar.
   Motorists have tried crossing into the neighboring republic of
Byelorussia to buy gasoline, but police stationed at the pumps
forbid sales to cars with Lithuanian license plates, except those
driven by Soviet military officers.
   Many Russian residents of Lithuania are angry.
   ``People aren't buying my tomatoes,'' said Olga Avyorka, a
Russian who has a sidewalk stand. ``I'm not for independence.''
   Overall, however, reaction to the embargo has been not to panic,
but rather to learn to cope.
   A talk with Sivicki, the factory manager, suggests why Moscow
finds little support in this nation of 3.6 million people, which
the Soviet Union forcibly annexed in 1940 along with neighboring
Latvia and Estonia.
   On paper, Sivicki should be one of the people Soviet officials
hoped would oppose independence. He is an ethnic Pole, a member of
a 7 percent minority in Lithuania that the Kremlin says will suffer
if the republic secedes.
   Although Sivicki thinks Lithuania has moved too fast, he
supports independence and wants only to make sure Lithuanians do
not form an exclusive national elite.
   About 80 percent of the population is ethnic Lithuanian, a
higher ratio of native population than in the two other Baltic
republics. In Latvia, the figure is 51 percent and in Estonia about
63 percent.
   The Zhalgris factory, one of Lithuania's largest, has 1,300
employees. About 30 percent are ethnic Poles, 30 percent
Byelorussian, 25 percent Russian and 15 percent Lithuanian.
   Sivicki belongs to the Lithuanian Communist Party faction loyal
to Moscow, but he believes in private ownership and thinks the
Soviet-owned factory should be leased, and eventually sold, to its
employees.
   ``Under private ownership, we would produce more,'' he said.
   Many people interviewed said they were fed up with Soviet rule.
Vilnius, where many buildings date from the 16th and 17th
centuries, has the gritty, rundown, unpainted look of many cities
in Eastern Europe.
   ``Things have always been bad,'' said Rolandas Cepulis, a
butcher. ``Of course I support independence. How can you even ask?
We've lived like this for 50 years. How can it get any worse?''
   But his state-owned shop has meat. Summer is approaching and
stores are full of food, more varied and plentiful than in Moscow
and many other Russian cities.
   Vendors crowd the farmer's market. Many travel from the southern
republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia with oranges, tomatoes and
other produce.
   The strains are showing, however, and some residents are taking
unpaid vacations.
   Birute Chekuolene, a heart surgeon, stopped work early in May
because her hospital ran out of oxygen filters, which are purchased
abroad.
   Soviet officials can try to strangle the Lithuanian economy, and
have sent soldiers to occupy some city buildings, but Lithuanians
feel they already have seen the worst of what the Kremlin can offer.
   In the grounds of the 17th century Sts. Peter and Paul Church on
a hill near the city center, Leonore Jonciene knelt in prayer at a
small chapel built last year to honor the thousands of Lithuanians
exiled to Siberia by Josef Stalin in the 1940s.
   Ms. Jonciene, then 27, was exiled with her parents in 1949 to a
fishing village on Lake Baikal. Their crime was owning seven acres
of land, which made them ``big landowners'' and class enemies of
the Soviet government.
   Ten years in Siberia did not embitter her against Russians, who
lived in the same village of Olkhonsky and did the same work.
   It did harden her against Soviet power, however. ``I am ready to
support independence, no matter what, even if I go to prison,'' she
said.

   Los Angeles lagged behind other big cities in
federal narcotics charges when Robert Bonner, now President Bush's
choice to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, was U.S.
attorney there, court records show.
   Although the city regularly was near the top in the nation in
federal drug arrests, it ranked far lower in the percentage of
federal defendants charged with drug offenses during Bonner's
tenure.
   Throughout the period, the most common federal criminal charges
in the nation were drug-related, but in Los Angeles the most common
were fraud and embezzlement, according to a recent analysis of
court records by a Syracuse University research group.
   The study shows that Bonner's office brought a smaller
percentage of drug charges than the national average for U.S.
attorneys. Furthermore, he lagged behind a number of colleagues in
big cities that had fewer drug arrests to begin with.
   From the beginning of 1984 through the first half of 1987, 19
percent of federal criminal defendants in Los Angeles faced
narcotics charges. Federal prosecutors nationwide charged 27
percent of their defendants with drug counts during those years,
the researchers found in response to a request by The Associated
Press last week.
   The percentage of defendants charged with fraud and embezzlement
in Los Angeles in those years ranged from 20 to 29.
   Bonner, who is awaiting Senate action on his nomination,
declined to be interviewed about his work in Los Angeles. He has
been praised by drug agents for pursuing criminal charges in the
1985 kidnapping and murder in Mexico of DEA agent Enrique ``Kiki''
Camarena.
   But by early this year, drug crime was so rampant in Los Angeles
itself that the city was one of five areas designated by national
drug policy chief William Bennett for extra federal aid.
   In 1986, the DEA's Los Angeles office ranked third in the nation
in drug arrests with 452, behind only New York with 1,066 and Miami
with 861, according to DEA spokesman Joe Keefe.
   By 1989, Bennett noted, DEA had 1,033 major drug investigations
under way in Los Angeles, again behind only New York and Miami.
   Bonner, 48, was U.S. attorney in Los Angeles from early 1984
until mid-1989 when he became a U.S. district judge there. Bush
nominated him for the DEA post May 11. Justice Department spokesman
David Runkel praised his ``extraordinary experience'' in drug
investigations.
   The information about Bonner's record as a prosecutor was
contained in a broader study by the nonprofit Transactional Records
Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse, using records from the Federal
Judicial Center, a branch of the U.S. courts.
   This research is among the first made public comparing the work
of U.S. attorneys. The Justice Department also has similar
information but rarely discloses it.
   The Syracuse study was completed and sent to Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh last October, long before Bonner was picked for the
drug post.
   The research originally covered 1980-1987. Last week, at the
request of The Associated Press, co-authors David Burnham and
Margaret Hanus DeFleur calculated the averages for the portion of
those years in which Bonner was chief prosecutor.
   Last year, Bonner's former chief assistant prosecutor, Gary
Fees, said that the office had a heavy caseload of military
purchasing fraud and savings and loan fraud _ both efforts which he
said had high priority from the Justice Department. Neither area,
however, commanded the money, manpower or new legislation that
Justice devoted to the fight against drugs.
   Asked about the study, Justice spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade
said, ``Mr. Bonner is well respected by his peers and did an
outstanding job for the attorney general and the department. We're
certain that he will make an excellent head for DEA once he is
confirmed.'' She said she was not in a position to comment on the
specific numbers.
   The study also looked at the percentage of federal defendants
charged with drug counts in 10 other U.S. attorney offices.
   All 10 had higher percentages of drug defendants during the four
years than Los Angeles, which had 19 percent.
   They were: Baltimore, 36 percent; Boston, 33 percent; Brooklyn,
N.Y., 44 percent; Manhattan, N.Y., 43 percent; Chicago, 20 percent;
Detroit, 34 percent; Hartford, Conn., 40 percent; Newark, N.J., 29
percent; Philadelphia, 33 percent; and San Francisco, 21 percent.
   Asked about the study last October, the Justice Department's
Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys released its own data for 1988,
showing that Los Angeles' percentage that year was 26.
   Justice's 1988 data showed four of the 10 areas ranked ahead of
Los Angeles: Brooklyn with 52 percent; Manhattan, 48; Detroit, 39;
and Baltimore, 37.
   Hartford, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia had 25 percent;
Newark, 23 percent; and San Francisco, 18 percent.
   Bonner, boosted by Thornburgh for a judgeship and now the DEA
post, has pursued some policies reminiscent of Thornburgh's.
   Early on as a prosecutor, Bonner unsuccessfully tried to take
control of the department's independent organized crime strike
force in Los Angeles. Thornburgh lost a similar battle as U.S.
attorney in Pittsburgh in the early 1970s.
   Last year, when Thornburgh renewed that reorganization effort as
attorney general, his aides recruited Bonner to sing the praises of
the idea to reporters.

   People are laughing _ yes, laughing _ at the
sight of a plump, 63-year-old grandmother being mocked night after
night as ``this gross wat'ry pumpkin ... this whale ... a bag of
flax, a puff'd man, old, cold, wither'd and of intolerable
entrails.''
   Don't feel sorry for Pat Carroll. She has only herself to blame
for her humiliation, and she loves every minute of it.
   Miss Carroll, a veteran stage, screen and TV actress and
comedian, is believed to be the first female performer ever to play
Sir John Falstaff, the leering, sack-swilling old windbag in ``The
Merry Wives of Windsor.''
   Eight times a week at the Shakespeare Theater at the Folger,
Miss Carroll spends 45 grueling minutes acquiring jowls, side
whiskers, mustache, beetle brows and wispy gray thatch. Then she
struggles into the baggiest britches this side of Barnum &amp; Bailey.
   Miss Carroll began preparing for Falstaff, ironically, by losing
30 pounds on a liquid diet and opting for extra padding around her
belly.
   ``I knew this would be a very strenuous role, and I suffer from
far too much weight,'' she said, munching on a juicy red apple
during an interview.
   She shuddered at the thought of climbing those stairs and
chasing Mistress Ford around the stage all night. And she
sympathized with the two lackeys who haul Falstaff away in a
laundry basket to help him escape the wrath of a jealous husband.
   ``I simply did not want to be responsible for bad backs and
hernias,'' Miss Carroll said.
   Although she has a naturally low voice, made hoarse by age,
cigarettes and her roaring Irish laughter, Miss Carroll practiced
voice and breathing exercises to achieve a deeper, more masculine
tone.
   She took walking lessons from Kabuki theater director Tadashi
Suzuki, who makes his actors practice in bare feet.
   ``My walk is a combination of bad feet, sore knees, 20 pounds of
costume and thinking of Jackie Gleason,'' she said. ``Because
Jackie, even at his heaviest, had a kind of lightness about him. He
used his hands very delicately, like a surgeon, and his feet were
always twinkling. I used him as my mental image of a male body that
was protuberance-heavy but still able to dance.''
   With the help of the Folger's male actors, Miss Carroll overcame
her feminine impulse to greet them with motherly hugs and learned
instead to express ``male camaraderie'' with pokes, punches and
slaps on the fanny.
   She took the time for some furtive research on facial hair and
what men do with it.
   ``At restaurants I would sit casually and look at gentlemen with
mustaches or beards,'' she said. ``Some are twirlers, some are
fluffers, some are strokers and some are pinchers. I have a
suspicion they're worried about food, crumbs and such, sticking in
that hair.''
   Miss Carroll has been lusting after the Falstaff role since the
early 1960s, when she saw her first ``Merry Wives'' at the Royal
Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, England, but she had a long wait.
   She starred in Broadway shows and films, did TV comedy routines
with Sid Caesar and Danny Thomas, appeared as celebrity guest on
``What's My Line?'' and ``Password'' quiz shows, and won cheers for
her one-woman show as Gertrude Stein. Her last credit was the voice
for the animated squid-witch Ursula in Disney's Oscar-winning ``The
Little Mermaid.''
   She finally made her Shakespeare debut at the Folger in 1986 as
the nurse in ``Romeo and Juliet,'' which won her a Helen Hayes
Award for best supporting actress. Michael Kahn, the Folger's
artistic director, asked what she'd like to do next, and she made
her pitch for Falstaff.
   Kahn laughed, but thought about it. Two years later, when the
Folger called about casting for ``Merry Wives,'' she was dead
serious. After seeing her in fake whiskers, he bought the idea.
   ``It was a divine role that I wanted to play,'' she said, ``and
a brilliant artistic director gave me the rope to hang myself.''
   Not to worry, Miss Carroll. The show, which runs at the Folger
through July 1, opened with rave reviews and the audiences are
howling. Suspended disbelief is epidemic.
   Miss Carroll's only lingering apprehension concerns her
mustache, which must endure Falstaff's frequent quaffs from a
tankard.
   ``I perspire so profusely, and I drink an awful lot of water
onstage,'' she said. ``I have nightmares about losing half my
mustache. I'd look like a very pudgy Hitler.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Appear Headed for Tighter FmHA Loan Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress may be getting a little fed up with a
3-year-old law giving the Farmers Home Administration a free hand
in forgiving some big debts, including about 100 of $1 million or
more.
   Bills in both the House and Senate would clamp a lid on the
amount of bad debt that FmHA could excuse and would tighten some
other loopholes in the agency's farm lending program.
   The free hand was provided by Congress itself in the
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, which was aimed at streamlining
and liberalizing debt-collection policies of FmHA, an Agriculture
Department agency.
   By last Nov. 30, the most recent tabulation available, almost
16,000 delinquent farm loans totaling nearly $2.8 billion had been
forgiven by FmHA under the 1987 law.
   Those include write-downs, write-offs and other settlements of
old debts, some going back a decade or more.
   The forgiveness of all or part of the debt owed to FmHA was
authorized by Congress on grounds that in many cases the assets
currently held by borrowers are worth far less than the face value
of the original loans.
   Land values, a mainstay for farm credit, plummeted in the 1980s,
wiping out much of the previous net worth of borrowers and reducing
loan collateral.
   In many cases, a FmHA borrower could not be expected to regain
enough cash flow to repay the old loans. So a solution has been to
write down the debt to the current value of the collateral.
   Another practice has been to let borrowers ``buy out'' their
loans at current liquidation values.
   By whatever method, the FmHA as of Nov. 30 had written off
nearly one-third of the $8.8 billion in overdue loans.
   Last week the Senate Agriculture Committee approved a 1990 farm
bill provision aimed at FmHA credit policies, including a $350,000
lid on debt forgiveness.
   A similar measure in the House would impose a $250,000 limit on
the FmHA practice.
   The administration wants the credit loopholes plugged, and the
Agriculture Department says it favors a $250,000 lid on FmHA loan
forgiveness.
   Roland R. Vautour, USDA undersecretary for small community and
rural development, told Congress earlier this year that ``huge
amounts are being forgiven because there is no dollar limit in the
law.''
   Vautour, who oversees FmHA operations, said the average of all
loan write-downs was $172,857 and that the average write-off was
$205,674 per loan.
   ``Most borrowers would be unaffected if the maximum amount that
could be forgiven were set at $250,000,'' he said.
   According to FmHA figures as of Nov. 30, more than 4,600 loans
were written down $796.5 million. As Vautour testified, that was an
average reduction of $172,857 each.
   There were more than 5,000 loans completely written off for more
than $1.03 billion, an average of $205,674 each. Also, more than
6,300 old loans totaling more than $933 million were stricken from
FmHA books as uncollectible.
   The FmHA has its roots in the Great Depression of the 1930s and
traditionally has been the government's farm lender of last resort.
Only those who can't get credit elsewhere need apply.
   Even without the write-offs and other forgiveness features, the
agency would be operating at a loss.
   Vautour said FmHA estimated the cost of debt restructuring under
the 1987 law alone will total more than $8 billion.
   ``When you add interest subsidies, write-offs not attributable
to the (1987 law), and other expenses, we are looking at overall
losses in our farm programs of something more than $22 billion over
the next several years,'' he testified.
   Some critics, including Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter,
maintain that FmHA has effectively departed from being a credit
agency and has operated grant programs in recent years.
   When Yeutter announced the Bush administration's proposals for
the 1990 farm bill on Feb. 6, he was asked about FmHA programs.
   ``We've gone a long way from its original purpose of being a
source of credit of last resort for farmers, and you've got a whole
variety of ways that have made it very nearly a grant program in
many of its attributes,'' Yeutter said. ``The result of that is
that it has cost the department and the American taxpayer a great
deal of money.''
   Yeutter said FmHA has had ``immense losses'' through the years,
and ``it just seems to us that in a time of budget austerity ... we
cannot afford to run that program in the same manner anymore.''

   Three giant African frogs touted as
potential record-breakers were big flops at the Jumping Frog
Jubilee, beat out by a puny domestic one-pounder named Help Mr.
Wizard.
   ``I wasn't afraid of the African frogs,'' said Gregg Jaschek,
who took home the $500 first prize Sunday. ``I saw them on TV. They
weren't so hot.''
   Some veterans of the annual Calaveras County competition had
complained the giants from Cameroon had an unfair advantage, but
organizers voted in March to let Seattle animal collector Andy
Koffman bring on his burly outsiders.
   Three of Koffman's Goliaths made it to the finals, but he
couldn't get a decent leap out of the three-pounders. They were too
big to fit on the 9-inch starting pad and were disqualified, or
slipped and slid their way to lackluster hops.
   A dripping Help Mr. Wizard soared 19 feet, 3 inches in three
jumps to best 72 other finalists.
   ``I'll be back,'' declared Koffman, who had claimed his frogs
could leap 30 feet in a single bound.
   The 62nd annual jubilee 150 miles east of San Francisco drew a
capacity crowd of 8,000, thanks to the controversy over Koffman's
frogs. The event was inspired by Mark Twain's short story ``The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,'' about a frog that
couldn't jump because its belly had been filled with lead shot.
   Jaschek, an auto parts clerk from Concord, said he captured Help
Mr. Wizard in the San Joaquin Valley. Its win was just luck, he
said.
   ``I've been trying for 19 years and if I knew the secret of
winning I would have won long before this,'' he said, kissing his
frog as friends poured champagne on him.
   Second place went to an 18-foot, 4-inch leap in three jumps by a
frog named Cho Cho. Third place was won by Jumpin' Jack.
   Koffman brought 27 Goliaths to the frog jump. The big frogs can
weigh up to 15 pounds and range up to three feet in length. His
three finalists _ Johnny Carson, Jay Leno and Sue _ weighed in at
about three pounds each.
   The average domestic frog weighs about a pound and is about
eight inches long.
   Koffman was done in by a rule that frogs must have all four feet
on the pad. The big frogs also leaped at an angle and made little
stutter hops after landing. Under the rules, the distance jumped is
the total of three successive hops.
   ``They just kind of slip out of my hands and it slows them
down,'' Koffman said. ``I'm really disappointed.''
   Before the meet, Koffman, who keeps the frogs in a 1,500-gallon
tank in his basement, predicted they would easily shatter the
record, held by one-pound Rosie the Ribiter, who jumped 21 feet, 5}
inches in three leaps in 1985.
   In one qualifying event, Johnny Carson jumped 12 feet, 4}
inches, enough to win the round. Sue won its round with a leap of
13 feet, 5 inches. Jay Leno finished fifth on its way to the finals.
   The big frogs are on California's dangerous animals list and
needed exemptions to be brought into the state. Koffman had to
promise to keep the sharp-toothed frogs away from domestic animals.
   ``I think Mark Twain is up there right now looking down and
laughing,'' jubilee official Buck King said in March at the height
of the controversy.

<TEXT>
   It was a sight never before seen by the press
corps that follows President Bush _ the president was actually
sitting down during a golf match.
   But there he was _ in the middle of the Doug Sanders celebrity
pro-am golf tournament _ seated on the green, not just once, but on
two different holes.
   Bush, who puts as much emphasis on golfing speed as he does on
precision, was forced to cool his heels while the tournament
leader, Lee Trevino, finished his much more contemplative play just
ahead of Bush's foursome.
   It was definitely a change of pace for the president to play in
a tournament instead of a wide-open course where everyone allows
him to blast through.
   ``It's different, that's for sure,'' Bush said, chatting briefly
with reporters while waiting for Trevino to finish the 13th hole at
the Deerwood country club outside Houston.
   Known for his hyperkinetic energy and pace, Bush generally races
through 18 holes without pausing for longer than it takes to wipe
his brow.
   His record was under two hours at the Cape Arundel Golf Course
last summer near his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   One aide has dubbed his playing style as ``aerobic golf.''
   Sunday's 18 holes in sweltering heat and humidity took him 4{
hours.
   Bush was joined by his oldest son, Texan George W. Bush, who
also is no slouch at fast play.
   But the president didn't seem to mind waiting, especially since
it gave him a chance to savor the adulation of thousands of people
lining the links and cheering him on.
   Bush, whose golfing tends to be a bit uneven, was ebullient when
he hit a good shot, downcast when he flubbed one. At one point, he
used his club to help fish one of his son's errant shots out of the
water.
   At another point, he demonstrated how to pick up his golf cap
from the ground with a club.
   When his son hit an exceptionally accurate drive, Bush
exclaimed, ``That's my lad. That's my fine boy.''
   He scrunched up his face and moaned, ``Oh, oh, oh, oh'' in
disappointment when his tee-off on the same hole veered far to the
side.

   Bush is a familiar visitor to Houston's St. Martin's Episcopal
Church near his sometime residence in the Houstonian
apartment-hotel complex.
   His presence on Sunday was acknowledged by the Rev. Claude E.
Payne. Payne did not mention the president by name, instead telling
the congregation that the church was honored by yet another visit
from ``a commuting parishioner who has been coming here for 30
years and who now resides in Washington D.C.''
   Bush usually sits with his wife Barbara during church services.
But he had different seatmates on Sunday since Mrs. Bush did not
accompany him to Houston.
   The president sat between golf pro Doug Sanders, his partner
from the previous day's tournament, and an old friend, Pete
Roussel, once his congressional press secretary and now a public
relations executive in Houston.

   While Congress and the Bush administration
hold urgent talks on deficit reduction, House members are deluging
constituents with taxpayer-financed mail in an election year.
   The House has been getting its nose tweaked by the Senate over
the stream of newsletters and town meeting notices that are an
incumbent's best friend.
   ``It goes without saying that taxpayers will likely be
outraged'' to learn the House may exceed its $40.7 million mail
budget by $38 million, Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Don Nickles,
R-Okla., wrote to a House committee chairman last month.
   Last week, the cost overrun was projected by lawmakers at $44
million.
   The Senate, meanwhile, ``is expected to have a $6 million
surplus'' in its $23.7 million mail budget, the two senators wrote
to Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill. Reid is chairman and Nickles the
ranking Republican on the Appropriations subcommittee on the
legislative branch. Annunzio is chairman of the House
Administration Committee.
   Why the difference in mail costs? The Senate has imposed rules
on itself to hold down the mail expense. The House agreed to some
changes last year, but didn't go as far.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations
legislative branch subcommittee, said he wouldn't support overall
restrictions in mass mailings, but would listen to suggestions on
setting limits for individual members.
   He accused the Senate of transferring money from other accounts
into the mail account ``in an election year.''
   Fazio's criticism only underscores the bitterness lingering from
the Senate's insistence last year that the House curb its mail
costs.
   The Senate requires each member to disclose his mail costs.
Mailings are prohibited once a senator's money allotment is
exhausted, although the Rules Committee can switch funds from
another senator who failed to use his full amount. Senators are
given allotments based on a state's population.
   During last year's battle over mail costs, the Senate persuaded
the House to agree to separate accounts for each chamber. The
number of House newsletter mailings was reduced from six to three.
   But the House still lacks individual disclosure and can keep on
mailing after the budgeted money is exhausted. The House can pass a
supplemental appropriation to reimburse the Postal Service or make
that agency absorb the costs. Either way, the mail gets delivered.
   Fazio last week won tentative support from senators to let the
House use $25 million in unspent funds to make up a portion of the
postage deficit.
   Reid said he's encouraged by Fazio's willingness to discuss
individual accounting and disclosure for House members.
   ``That's the key, a step in the right direction,'' Reid said.
But he also expressed a willingness to do battle again, adding,
``We're going try to get the mail monster under control.''
   The Postal Service said senators sent out 45.4 million pieces of
mail at a cost of $6.9 million in the first half of fiscal 1990.
Over a year the projections, based on historical trends, are 115.6
million pieces and $17.7 million in cost.
   The Postal Service show the House spent $32 million to send
212.5 million pieces of mail in the first half of fiscal 1990,
which began Oct. 1. Projected over a full year, the figures would
be 532.7 million pieces and $78.9 million in expenditures.
   Two prominent House Republicans, Minority Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois and Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, have introduced bills aimed
at further limiting the number of town meeting and newsletter
mailings, establishing separate accounts for each House member and
public disclosure.
   Both plan to try to add their proposals to the appropriation
bill for running Congress.
   ``At the moment, there has been no sign'' of help from the
majority House Democratic leadership, Frenzel said. ``The frank is
a very powerful influence in elections. I don't think the Democrats
are going to let loose of it without some great pressure being
applied.''
   Frenzel, who is retiring, said the mail cost could be a ``good
political issue'' for Republicans, but quickly added, ``There are a
number of Republicans who regard the franking perk as zealously as
Democrats.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Personal Tragedy Shapes Debate on Two House
Bills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politics, lobbying and public opinion polls
drive Congress' agenda. But sometimes another motivation comes into
play: personal tragedy.
   Such is the case with two House bills debated this month _ one
on family leave policy and the other aimed at expanding the rights
of the disabled.
   Republican Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey has spent a decade
in the House racking up a pro-business voting record. But on the
issue of whether the government should give employees the right to
unpaid leave for family medical emergencies, she and the business
lobby part ways.
   Roukema was the prime Republican sponsor of the bill which
passed the House earlier this month. She scolded those, especially
business groups, who went the other way.
   ``The organized business lobby in Washington is out of step with
the real world and that includes conscientious, no-nonsense,
bottom-line business people at the grass roots,'' she said. ``The
lobbyists have overreacted in a way that no one can explain to me.''
   For Mrs. Roukema, the need to take unpaid leave from work to
care for a new child or a critically ill relative relates directly
to her own suffering.
   ``These are not abstract problems,'' she told the House in an
emotional speech. ``I know. I've been there.''
   She recalled that when she started raising a family, her son was
stricken with fatal leukemia. He ``needed home care, I was free to
remain at home and give him the loving care he needed.'' But today,
many households don't have the luxury of one spouse making enough
money so the other can quit work.
   ``I continually asked myself during this process, `What would I
have done if I not only had the tragedy and the trauma of caring
for my child, but also had to worry about losing a job and a roof
over my head?''' she said.
   Many years later, Mrs. Roukema found an answer in the parental
leave bill.
   This week, the House expected to complete action on the
Americans With Disabilities Act. One of the main forces in getting
that legislation moving is no longer in the House, but he came back
last week for the start of the debate.
   Former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho resigned from the House
last year to avoid an inquiry into his personal finances. But his
support for the bill has nothing to do with money. Coelho has
epilepsy.
   ``If I were not epileptic, I probably wouldn't have the real
passion in disabilities issues that I do,'' Coelho said. ``I know
what it's like to be discriminated against.''
   For most in Congress, ``You don't think about these folks
because you aren't disabled,'' he said. ``They,'' he said,
referring to the people in wheelchairs who sat outside the House
chamber during the debate, ``They don't have a PAC (political
action committee) and they don't understand the political process.''
   When he left Congress last year, Coelho said he told Speaker
Thomas Foley that he didn't intend to come back as a lobbyist as so
many of his colleagues have. ``But I made one exception. For the
rest of my life, I would lobby on disability legislation,'' he said.
   There was plenty of lobbying on both the parental leave bill and
the disabilities act. But the stories behind the legislation added
poignancy missing from debates on the budget or foreign aid.
   They also helped tip the scales toward passage.
   The Roukema and Coelho tragedies, not to mention others recalled
in the debates, make it extraordinarily tough for lawmakers to make
a dispassionate choice. Congress can be a very intimate place, and
the peer pressure can be so enormous that voting ``no'' is not an
acceptable option.
   Of course, much of what Congress does is based to some degree on
personal experiences of the members, such as the former farmer who
might get on the agriculture committee to write farm laws.
   Other lawmakers' experiences may be translated into legislation
of a less magnanimous nature, such as a provision in a tax bill to
help out the family business, or a government project for a
developer friend back home.

<HEAD>Contra Commanders Say They Won't Give Up Their Guns</HEAD>

   Contra commanders say they have
stopped disarming and will not tell their troops to give up their
guns unless the government offers more safety guarantees.
   ``Demobilized fighters are not getting the treatment they
deserve,'' said Oscar Sovalbarro, the second-ranking Contra
commander, in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Sovalbarro, known as ``Commander Ruben,'' said the demobilized
Contras were being harassed by the Sandinistas and weren't getting
enough food, medical care and assistance to establish themselves in
civilian life.
   His statements Saturday followed a meeting with government
disarmament coordinator Roberto Ferrey. According to a presidential
communique, Ferrey told the Contra high command: ``The government
remains steadfast in its commitment to give you all the guarantees
and security measures you require.''
   In the communique, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro called
on the Nicaraguan people to support ``the demobilized and disarmed
that have been integrated into civilian life . . . in order to
contribute to the pacification of the country.''
   The U.S.-backed Contras fought the leftist Sandinistas for nine
years in a civil war that claimed 30,000 lives. When Mrs.
Chamorro's U.S.-supported administration took over from the
Sandinistas after February elections, the rebels agreed to disarm
by June 10.
   But so far, only 1,084 out of an estimated 11,000 fighters have
put aside their weapons, according to the latest government figures.
   Sovalbarro blamed the delay on the Sandinistas, who he said were
subverting Mrs. Chamorro's reconciliation efforts.
   ``The government is sympathetic. But it doesn't have any money,
and the Sandinistas are disobeying orders,'' he said.
   He cited a six-day civil service strike last week, which
virtually paralyzed the government, as an example. The public
employees' union is controlled by the Sandinistas.
   The Sandinistas claim the Contras' stalling is a pretext for
attracting U.S. aid.
   Sovalbarro spoke for the Contra high command gathered at El
Almendro, a village 110 miles southeast of Managua in the center of
one of five security zones where Contra fighters agreed to lay down
their arms.
   High command leaders, from whom rebels take their orders, chose
to hold forth in El Almendro because they feel it is safer than
other security zones where they fear they might be surrounded by
the military.
   El Almendro is set in a sparsely populated ranching area where
support for the rebels is strong. The nearest Sandinista troops
spotted by reporters were 25 miles up a dirt road to the north.
   Sovalbarro said that the June 10 disarmament deadline could
still be met if there was ``an atmosphere of confidence.''
   He said the Sandinistas would have to stop their ``war of
insults'' against the Contras and would also have to stop ``trying
to destabilize the government.''
   He cited what he considered examples of Sandinista harassment _
two demobilized fighters beaten by Sandinista militants in Masaya,
another fighter's body found along a road. He said one former
fighter had returned to camp complaining of harassment.
   Ferrey had said Saturday that the Contras would continue
disarming despite the high command's decision.
   But Sovalbarro said that simply meant individual Contras
wouldn't be stopped if they wanted to leave. He said that had
always been the case _ the Contras are volunteers and anyone can
leave any time.
   ``But as leaders, we cannot tell our fighters to demobilize
until there is a guarantee that they will be left in peace,''
Sovalbarro said.
   Fighters interviewed by the AP said they would not disband
without orders. ``The Sandinistas are doing things that aren't good
for us,'' said a rebel who called himself Bengala, ``The Bengal.''
He said he had been fighting for six years.

<TEXT>
   Other people's smoke is a proven cause of heart
disease in non-smokers, raising their risk of dying from the
disease by up to 30 percent, a study says.
   In a presentation in Boston at the World Conference on Lung
Health, Stanton Glantz of the University of California, San
Francisco, said research is beginning to show exactly how cigarette
smoke alters the heart, blood and arteries. He presented a study in
which he reviewed others' research on the subject.
   In 1986, the Surgeon General concluded in his annual report on
smoking and health that so-called passive smoking causes lung
cancer in non-smokers. At that time, the evidence was insufficient
to link passive smoking with heart disease, the report said.
   Newer studies have changed that, Glantz said Friday in a
telephone interview.
   ``The evidence that passive smoking causes heart disease is
stronger today than the evidence was in 1986 that passive smoking
caused lung cancer,'' Glantz said.
   Glantz's report comes one week after the Environmental
Protection Agency said it will soon declare environmental tobacco
smoke a known carcinogen.
   The EPA concluded that passive smoking causes 3,000 deaths.
Glantz said passive smoking also causes 32,000 heart disease deaths.
   ``The heart disease deaths combined with the cancer deaths make
passive smoking the third leading cause of preventable death,
behind smoking and alcohol,'' he said.
   Glantz is a researcher and statistician who conducts research in
cardiology, has written two textbooks on biostatistics and serves
on the California State Scientific Review Panel on toxic air
contaminants.
   His collaborator in the study was Dr. William Parmley, a
cardiologist, chief of the division of cardiology at University of
California, San Francisco, and a past president of the American
College of Cardiology.
   The Tobacco Institute, which represents cigarette makers,
emphasized that the Surgeon General in 1986 had failed to find
proof that passive smoking causes heart disease.
   ``There have been only three studies since then, and they
continue to support the conclusions,'' Brennan Dawson, a
spokeswoman for the institute, said in a telephone interview Friday.
   But Glantz said there are 11 studies on passive smoking and
heart disease deaths, and ``all but one the tobacco industry funded
show an increased risk.'' The studies showed an increased risk of
between 20 percent and 30 percent, he said.
   Furthermore, he said, ``there's evidence from several areas that
passive smoking reduces the ability of the heart to obtain and
profit from oxygen.''
   Carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke binds with hemoglobin in the
blood, reducing its capacity to carry oxygen, Glantz said. Smoke
also reduces the ability of cells in the heart to covert oxygen to
a chemical called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which provides
energy to the heart, he said.
   ``What you end up with is: The blood doesn't carry oxygen well.
The heart doesn't pump as well. And what oxygen gets to the heart
isn't used as well,'' he said.
   One consequence of that _ which can be measured _ is that people
exposed to second-hand smoke can't exercise as long, he said. That
is true of both healthy non-smokers and non-smokers with heart
disease, he said.
   Cancer-causing agents in the smoke, especially benzo(a)pyrene,
have been found to injure artery linings, he said. Such injuries
are one of the first steps in the development of life-threatening
blood clots in the coronary arteries that nourish the heart, he
said.
   Studies have also shown that blood platelets, which help blood
clot, become ``stickier'' and more likely to clot in non-smokers
exposed to cigarette smoke. In fact, non-smokers are much more
sensitive to this effect than are smokers, he said.
   This ``stickiness'' can increase the risk of clotting in the
coronary arteries, Glantz said.

<HEAD>State Ban on Small Life Insurance Policies Headed for Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state ban on life insurance policies
that regulators consider unfair to the elderly could be the start
of a national trend if it withstands an industry challenge in
court, officials say.
   The policies typically are advertised on television with the
appeal: `You cannot be canceled. Your premium can never go up and
your protection can never go down.''
   The policies offer immediate protection and are intended for the
elderly. But they require high premiums that can amount to more
than the benefits at death.
   Washington Insurance Commissioner Dick Marquardt adopted a
regulation last year that restricts the sale of such policies. Two
insurance companies that specialize in the policies challenged the
regulation in Superior Court and lost. They appealed, and the state
Supreme Court is scheduled to take up the case May 24.
   ``We're a trailblazer with this regulation,'' Marquardt said.
``Other state regulators are inquiring. And the fact that we're in
court points up the fact we're a leader in this type of
regulation.''
   Marquardt said he searched for years for a way to ban the
policies. Since he cannot regulate life insurance policies or
rates, he came up with a regulation against unfair competition or
``deceptive acts or practices.''
   ``We have been concerned because many plans currently on the
market literally trap the insured individual in a no-win
situation,'' said David Rodgers, the state's chief deputy insurance
commissioner.
   Rodgers said elderly holders of the policies would be better off
putting the money in a bank. He gave the following example:
   A 77-year-old woman buys a 10-year policy at a monthly premium
of $21.55. The death benefit starts at $500 and increases to $1,000
after 10 years. If the woman had simply banked the money at 5
percent interest, the return would have been better, Rodgers said.
   He said after the first year, premiums plus interest would have
totaled $266. Had the woman died in the first year, her estate
would have received $500, or $234 more than premiums, Rodgers said.
After that, the estate would lose.
   Premiums and interest after the second year would have totaled
$544, the benefit $540. At the end of 10 years, premiums plus
interest would have totaled $3,340, the benefit $1,000.
   ``Unless the olicyholder dies within a small window of time, the
premium will be more than the benefit,'' Rodgers said. ``Even if
the policyholder dies within the window of time, the gain for the
estate is often so small as to be meaningless even in a modest
estate.''
   The challenge has been mounted by Omega National Insurance Co.,
which has been doing business in Washington since 1979, and Pierce
National Insurance Co. It has been doing business in the state
since 1948.
   Most of the life insurance policies the companies handled in
Washington were banned, their lawyers said in court papers. The
regulation, they said, ``violates a fundamental precept of
insurance, that risk classifications should be equitable.''
   The companies said that forcing them to dump the policies would
force younger, healthier policyholders to subsidize the elderly.
They said Marquardt ``has attacked a perceived but unsubstantiated
problem with a sledge hammer.''

   The House is aiming for a vote this week on
clean air legislation, but first must decide whether to require
automakers to manufacture non-gasoline cars for nine of the most
polluted cities.
   House leaders have said they want a vote on the bill before
Congress begins its Memorial Day recess on Friday. Floor debate was
scheduled to begin today on the measure, which would be the first
revision of federal air pollution laws in 13 years.
   The Senate approved clean air legislation in April after lengthy
private discussions between Senate leaders and the White House.
   The Bush administration has had no such discussions in the
House, where the Energy and Commerce Committee produced a bill by a
41-1 vote in April.
   Both versions would cost the economy about $21 billion a year
when the new controls go fully into effect.
   The House bill, like the Senate version, calls for steep cuts in
acid rain pollutants as well as unprecedented controls on urban
smog, largely from automobiles, and curbs on toxic industrial
emissions.
   ``We're pretty well where we're going to stay,'' Rep. Terry
Bruce, D-Ill., said of most of the major components of the package,
including provisions that will force coal-burning electric
utilities to reduce their annual acid rain emissions by 10 million
tons.
   Key congressmen and their staffs were holding private talks in
hopes of working out agreements on some of the dozen or so
amendments expected to be brought to the floor for votes, probably
Wednesday and Thursday.
   The proposed amendments include one by Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., that would require automakers to manufacture up to 1
million alternative-fuel cars for sale in nine of the most
smog-troubled cities.
   A tentative agreement was reached on a proposal to require use
of a cleaner fuel in dozens of cities to curb the urban smog
problem.
   But no deal was expected on the Waxman amendment or on a
proposal to broaden the phaseout of chemicals that damage the
atmospheric ozone layer. Those issues are likely to be thrashed out
on the House floor, sources said.
   Waxman's amendment calls for manufacturers to build up to 1
million alternative fuel vehicles to be sold in the nine cities.
   The automakers, who oppose the amendment, have a strong ally in
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
   The automakers argue that no one has shown that cars powered by
such fuels as methanol, ethanol natural gas or electricity would be
accepted by the public, especially if there was uncertainty about
the fuel supply.
   ``The fate of alternative fuel vehicles hinges on consumer
acceptance and consumers are flashing a yellow warning light,''
argues Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association. Supporters of Waxman's amendment suggest that by late
in the decade when such cars would have to be produced, the fuel
availability issue will have been resolved.
   Industry also has lobbied vigorously against the amendment that
would broaden the phaseout requirements on ozone-depleting
chemicals, including some that are considered ``bridge''
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC. Manufacturers already
are committed to phasing out CFCs, but have argued they need the
``bridge'' substitutes.

^Ethnic Hungarians and Romanians Put Aside Enmity on Election Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   CLUJ-NAPOCA, Romania (AP) _ Ethnic Hungarians and Romanians put
aside their traditional enmity for at least one day as they flocked
to the polls throughout Transylvania, where bloody ethnic clashes
erupted earlier this year.
   There had been fears that the volatile passions aroused by the
campaign might lead to violence on Election Day. In March, six
people died and some 300 were injured in clashes in the town of
Tirgu Mures.
   But on Sunday, both ethnic Hungarians and Romanians relished the
opportunity to cast votes in the country's first free elections in
53 years.
   ``We found the Romanians genuinely excited about the chance to
vote freely,'' said Eric Koenig, a member of the Washington-based
Human Rights Law Group and among about 500 foreign observers
monitoring the election.
   ``In this area, we didn't see any evidence of an organized
effort to tamper with or influence the voting process,'' said
Koenig, after touring polling places in Cluj-Napoca and nearby
villages Sunday.
   Sandor Balazs, president of the Cluj chapter of the Hungarian
Democratic Union, a group representing Romania's 2-million-strong
Hungarian minority, said members of the rival ethnic communities
even shared horse-drawn carts to get to rural polling places.
   Under ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, ethnic
Hungarians complained of discrimination, saying their language and
cultural traditions were being suppressed.
   The Democratic Union says the Hungarians must continue to fight
for their rights following the bloody December revolution that led
to Ceausescu's execution.
   An exit poll taken by a West German polling firm showed the
ethnic Hungarian party winning 6 percent of the votes nationwide
for seats in the two-chamber parliament.
   In the Cluj region, the only major complaint was the same echoed
elsewhere in the country _ the long lines of people waiting to
vote, due to a heavy turnout and complicated voting procedures.
   ``I've been coming by all day, hoping the crowd diminished,''
complained Tibor Szekely, an 85-year-old ethnic Hungarian, as he
viewed the long line stretching outside a downtown polling station
in a school.
   In Leglia, a sleepy ethnic Hungarian village of 700 peasants
about 20 miles northwest of Cluj, residents complained about having
to travel to a nearby village to vote.
   But fears of a hostile reception by the Romanian residents of
Aghires, one mile down the road, did not materialize.
   There was even a long line of voters outside the Romanian
Embassy in the Hungarian capital of Budapest. At least 15,000
Romanian citizens, most of them ethnic Hungarians, fled to Hungary
to escape the Ceausescu regime.
   Those who still retained their Romanian citizenship seemed eager
to vote. The Hungarian news agency MTI said about 3,500 had voted
at the embassy by early evening, and thousands more were waiting.
   Transylvania was ruled by Hungary for centuries before being
ceded to Romania after World War I. Hungary annexed the province
during World War II, but it was returned to Romania when the war
ended.

   Their father never allowed a free
election during his brutal 24-year rule, but the jailed children of
executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu were not denied their chance to
vote.
   Ceausescu's two sons and daughter were not handcuffed when they
appeared at a Bucharest police station to cast their ballots in
Sunday's elections, the first free vote in Romania in 53 years.
   The dictator's children are awaiting trial on charges of
complicity in his rule. All three have been jailed since December
and, if convicted, face sentences of up to life in prison.
   Nicu, 40, Ceausescu's youngest son and once his heir-apparent,
voted first. He spent several minutes in the booth before emerging
and dropping a large envelope in the ballot box.
   Nicu goes on trial next weekend on charges of complicity in
genocide in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu, 155 miles northwest of
Bucharest. He was regional Communist Party chief there until his
arrest.
   Clad in jeans and a dark sweater, Nicu declined to speak to
reporters at his first public appearance since being shown on
television the night of Dec. 22, just after his capture.
   Ceausescu's oldest son, Valentin, 43, a nuclear physics
engineer, spent comparatively little time in the booth.
   ``I'm treated like everyone else in prison,'' he said, smiling
and looking relaxed in a jogging suit top and jeans. He had long
hair, a beard and mustache.
   Ceausescu's only daughter, Zoia Elena, 38, a mathematician,
looked nervous and came out of the booth after only 20 seconds. She
refused to made a statement.
   Rompres said the young Ceausescus were allowed to vote ``as they
were under investigation and still not sentenced and stripped of
political and civil rights.''
   Members of Ceausescu's ruling Politburo who face trial also were
allowed to vote, the agency said.
   Ceausescu was toppled by a popular uprising Dec. 22. He and his
wife, Elena, were tried in secret and convicted of causing the
deaths of thousands while in power. They were executed by a firing
squad on Dec. 25.

   Simon Feller, 86, was a young man when
he last had a chance to vote in a free election in his country 53
years ago. Through four decades of Communist rule he harbored a
secret wish.
   ``I always hoped to vote in a fair election,'' he said.
   He got his chance Sunday when Romania held free elections for
president and the 506-seat parliament, just five months after a
bloody revolution toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   For 21-year-old Julius Cristea, the election offered a chance to
cast a ballot for a democratic Romania.
   ``I want Romania to become a democratic country and I'd like
communism to be erased from the earth,'' said Cristea, an
architecture student.
   For young and old alike, election memories were of the
rubber-stamp affairs held every four years by Ceausescu, in which
he claimed near unanimous support.
   Ion Moraru, 73, a retired auto mechanic, said he voted in past
years because ``if you didn't, they put you out of your job.''
   Sunday's election offered voters a choice from among 88 parties.
   ``I never thought I could live this long,'' said Stefan Ionescu,
75, a retired plumber.
   An exit poll showed the National Salvation Front, which has
governed the country since the December revolution, and its leader,
Interim President Ion Iliescu, headed for victory in the
presidential and parliamentary races.
   Voters of all ages expressed hope that the election would usher
in a new era of democracy in a country accustomed to authoritarian
rule.
   ``I hope the election will bring liberty, democracy and the
reduction of tension,'' Feller said.
   A 27-year-old engineering student who identified himself only as
Sorin said, ``Freedom makes my heart free. I am very happy to give
my vote in liberty.''
   ``We are hoping for a new life in Romania, a new life with the
rest of Europe, a life where we are the masters,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yehuda Lisky, editor of the last Yiddish newspaper
in Britain, is dead at 90, The Daily Telegraph reported today.
   The newspaper described Lisky as a champion of Yiddish culture
who ``wrote Yiddish, spoke Yiddish, dreamed Yiddish and, as he once
put it, drank Yiddish _ although in fact his favorite (drink) was
Scotch.''
   From his own resources in the 1950s, Lisky launched Dos Yiddishe
Folk (The Jewish People). It was published first weekly, then
biweekly, then monthly and finally whenever he had the money and
energy to produce it. He launched the newspaper in collaboration
with Avron Stencl, the poet of London's East End.
   Yiddish was the common language of East European Jewry. It
largely disappeared following the Nazi persecution of World War II
and the dying out of the older generation of survivors.
   Lisky was born in Oszene, Poland, and joined his brother Abraham
Fuchs, an established Yiddish writer living in Vienna.
   He came to London in 1930 and worked on a Yiddish daily, Die
Zeit. When it folded in 1950, Lisky started his own paper. He also
taught Yiddish at summer and winter schools in Oxford.
   Lisky was short in stature, bespectacled and cheerful. He wore a
black beret pulled low over his right ear and was well-known around
the cafes and bookstores of east and central London. He lost the
sight of one eye when he was attacked by a robber in his London
home in his 90th year.
   The Daily Telegraph said Lisky's wife Sonia died in 1984 and
they are survived by two sons.
   It did not give the date or cause of death.

   Guards at a maximum-security prison shot and
killed two inmates about to attack fellow prisoners with makeshift
knives, authorities say.
   Three other inmates were reported injured, one seriously, in the
melee Sunday night at the Stateville Correctional Center.
   The shootings came after a fight broke out among about 10
inmates from a prison gang, said Illinois Department of Corrections
spokesman Nic Howell.
   ``My understanding is the staff shot the inmates as they were
attempting to do harm to other inmates,'' Howell said. The cause of
the fight, which authorities said was brought under control within
45 minutes, wasn't disclosed.
   Inmates were confined to their cells after the brawl.
   One inmate was reported in fair condition at Silver Cross
Hospital with a gunshot wound to the leg. Another was listed in
serious condition with at least one stab wound.
   An inmate received wounds on the hand and was being treated at
the prison, a hospital spokesman said.
   Stateville is one of two maximum-security state prisons in
Joliet. The prison was built in 1920 to house 1,506 prisoners but
now holds about 2,100.
   Two inmates were stabbed to death in 1988 and 1989. A guard
known for aggressive tactics in confiscating drugs and weapons was
beaten to death last July after being put on a prison hit list
signed ``The Executioner.''

<HEAD>Taiwan's President Calls For Better Ties With China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui marked his
inauguration by calling for an end to hostilities and improved
relations with China's Communist government.
   Lee's remarks during Sunday's presidential inauguration ceremony
marked the first time a Taiwan president publicly indicated a
desire to move away from the 40-year-old policy of the ``three
No's'' toward Beijing _ no official contact, no negotiations and no
compromise.
   In Beijing, there was no mention of Lee's speech in any of the
nationally circulated official dailies, and the government declined
immediate comment.
   An official of the Taiwan Department in the State Council's
Overseas Chinese Office, asked for reaction on Lee's speech,
referred questions to the Foreign Ministry. The ministry, which
usually says Taiwan is part of China and thus not a foreign affairs
matter, had no immediate response.
   At his inauguration, Lee also promised amnesty for political
prisoners. He pledged the restoration of civil rights to previously
jailed political prisoners _ including the chairman of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party _ allowing them to run for
public office.
   Nine people imprisoned on sedition charges were released Sunday,
including Hsu Hsin-liang, 49, who was jailed last year after
returning from self-imposed exile in the United States.
   Taiwan's best-known political prisoner, Shih Ming-teh, was
released early this morning. He had been jailed in 1979 on charges
of instigating an anti-government riot in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung.
   He had originally refused to allow his family to sign for his
release because he maintains he is innocent, his sister said.
   Human rights groups claim Taiwan has roughly a dozen other
political prisoners.
   Meanwhile, Lee's nomination of Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun,
the nation's only four-star general, as premier continued to spark
protests on Sunday. Hau's opponents believe his nomination is a
step backward for democracy and could lead to a resurgence of
military influence.
   About 10,000 people, including students and opposition party
members, staged a noisy march through Taipei, smashing windows and
throwing eggs at offices of the military and the ruling Nationalist
Party.
   Lee heads the Nationalist Chinese government that has been based
on the island of Taiwan ever since losing a civil war to Communist
forces on the Chinese mainland in 1949.
   The Nationalists still claim to be the rightful government of
all China, and Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
   Lee proposed establishing ``channels of communication'' and said
the two countries should ``completely open up academic, cultural,
economic, trade, scientific and technological exchange to lay a
foundation of mutual respect, peace and prosperity.''
   But Lee said before relations could be established, Beijing must
renounce the use of force against Taiwan, end its policy of
isolating Taiwan diplomatically, and promote democracy and a free
economic system in China.
   While Beijing previously has indicated it would not meet
conditions set by Lee, the speech clearly was designed to reflect
Taipei's desire to gradually improve relations with its neighbor
across the Taiwan Straits. Recently, civilian and business contacts
have been growing between the two sides.
   Lee became the first native Taiwanese to lead the government in
January 1988 when he moved up from the vice presidency to succeed
President Chiang Ching-kuo, who died in office.
   Chiang was the eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist
leader who led the retreat to Taiwan four decades ago.

   A high-ranking Chinese Communist
Party official who left Hong Kong for Los Angeles has no plans to
defect and merely wants some rest and relaxation, his host says.
   Master Hsing Yun, a Buddhist monk, held a news conference at Hsi
Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, 20 miles from Los Angeles, to
dispel reports that Xu Jiatun defected.
   Xu, director of the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua News Agency
for nearly seven years, did not appear at the news conference.
Hsing Yun would not disclose his whereabouts or say how long he
planned to stay.
   ``Because we are friends, I do not have the right to ask why he
came or for how long,'' the monk said through an interpreter. ``He
said he did not come here to seek political asylum.''
   ``He told me that after he rests for a while he's planning to
make a broad survey and research on American society. He still
wishes to go back to his country and will not ever seek political
asylum.''
   He has been in seclusion since arriving in California on May 1.
   The Buddhist master said he and Xu have taken several trips
together, including a visit to the Grand Canyon.
   As bureau chief of the Beijing-controlled New China News Agency
in Hong Kong, Xu was China's top representative to the British
colony from 1983 until last year. His assignment was to prepare
Hong Kong for its return to China in 1997.
   Xu reportedly fell out of favor with the government of Premier
Li Peng after revealing his sympathy toward the pro-democracy
movement that was crushed last June in Tiananmen Square.
   Xu, 74, was reported to have left without the approval of his
government. But Hsing Yun said he believed Xu had permission to
visit the United States and that he was carrying a visa good for up
to six months.
   Public confidence in Hong Kong's future under Chinese rule was
shaken by Xu's departure. Many of Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents
have long been suspicious of China's plans for the territory after
the British leave.
   On Thursday the Foreign Ministry in Beijing said Xu was merely
``touring and taking a rest in the United States.''

   Two adults and three children were
found dead in an apartment house where four people reportedly were
overcome by carbon monoxide a day earlier. Authorities awaited
autopsies today for the cause of death.
   Three police officers at the building on an related matter found
the bodies in a first-floor apartment Sunday after smelling a
strong odor and forcing their way in, police said.
   A woman and a boy, about 2{ years old, were in a bedroom; a man
was in the living room; a 15-month-old girl was in the bathroom,
and a 4-year-old boy was in another bedroom, said Capt. Joseph
North.
   Their identities and relationships were not immediately
available.
   WCBS-AM in New York reported that four people, including two
children, were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes at the building on
Saturday. They were treated at a hospital and released.
   North said he was unable to confirm the report.

   Three men sprayed a Harlem bar with gunfire,
killing three patrons, and left behind photos of themselves posing
with their guns, police said.
   Two Polaroid snapshots were found Sunday on the floor of the
International Bar, said Capt. William Roe. In the pictures, three
men are displaying a machine pistol, a rifle and an automatic
pistol.
   Some patrons recognized the gunmen in the photos or knew them by
nicknames, Roe said.
   Witnesses said the three had posed for a street photographer in
the bar early Sunday and were headed for the door when they wheeled
and fired 15 shots into the crowd, the New York Post reported
today. About 40 to 50 people were in the bar.
   Police said they had no motive for the shootings.
   David Solferino, 22, was shot several times, leading police to
believe he may have been the target. Also killed were Randi Thomas,
26, who was shot once in the chest and died at the scene, and Leon
Dean, 22, who died at a hospital.
   Two of the injured were listed in stable condition. A third was
treated for a facial wound and released.
   The bar's owner, Leonard Williams, said there had been no fights
or arguments shortly before the shootings. He said several men near
the dance floor opened fire and yelled, ```Everyone get down! Get
down on the floor!''
   He said that within seconds, the men had fled and many patrons
had run out in panic. He said he did not recognize the men.
   ``If it was robbery, then they changed their minds,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Government officials called today
for a halt to to the violent protests that have rocked this
southern provincial city for the past three days.
   Also today, radical student leaders demanded that police be held
responsible for the death of a student who suffered fatal head
injuries Saturday after jumping from a train in an effort to join
the protesters.
   The students said 21-year-old Shin Jang-ho would be buried as a
martyr and patriot Wednesday after funeral services at Kwangju's
Chonnam University. About 100 militant students armed with metal
pipes guarded the hospital morgue where Shin's body was kept.
   Shin was among thousands of students who tried to avoid police
roadblocks in an effort to reach Kwangju for protest rallies
marking the 10th anniversary of the country's bloodiest civilian
uprising.
   Several thousand riot police who have been deployed in the
vicinity of the provincial government building since protests
erupted Friday stayed mostly out of sight today, apparently to
avoid antagonizing the radicals.
   In the past, the deaths of protesters have triggered massive
demonstrations.
   Kwangju Mayor Choi In-kee issued a statement saying the protests
against the government of President Roh Tae-woo and the presence of
U.S. troops in Korea had been instigated by outsiders.
   ``Violence will no longer be tolerated,'' the statement said.
Other government officials also demanded an end to the protests.
   Radical student leader Lee Ki-hon told a news conference today
that the ruling Democratic Liberal Party was ``a violent group.''
   He demanded that police officials be held accountable for Shin's
death and said those responsible should resign. The student
protesters say that if the police roadblocks had not been in place,
Shin would not have had to jump from the train.
   The District Prosecutor's Office in Kwangju said today that
testimony from train workers and other witnesses indicated Shin
died of injuries suffered when he jumped from the train. The
prosecutor said an autopsy would be performed to confirm the
finding.
   On Sunday, violence erupted for a third straight day when some
10,000 protesters shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' battled riot
police in downtown streets. Protesters tore up sidewalks for
projectiles to hurl at police and built bonfires at a dozen
intersections to light firebombs.
   Police fired 40 warning shots from automatic rifles to stop
about 50 protesters who tried to stage a firebomb attack on a
police station.
   Seoul's Dong-a Ilbo newspaper said 84 police officers and more
than 200 protesters were injured.
   The newspaper said 6,342 people had been arrested nationwide
since May 18, most of them in Kwangju, about 150 miles south of
Seoul. Of those arrested, it said 15 were formally charged with
instigating unrest, 35 sent before a summary court judge, and 130
others remained under investigation. The rest were released with
warnings, it said.
   The protesters are demanding the resignation of Roh, a former
army general who was a key leader of the martial law government
that crushed the 1980 Kwanju pro-democracy uprising. They claim the
January merger of the ruling party with two opposition groups is a
scheme by Roh to prolong his power.
   Kwangju citizens claim U.S. military officials condoned the
military crackdown on the 1980 uprising, which claimed some 200
lives and left more than 1,700 injured.

<HEAD>Exxon Crews Begin Spreading Fertilizer to Clean Alaska Shores</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon has begun applying fertilizer to
the shoreline to speed the breakdown of oil from the Exxon Valdez
spill.
   The company got the go-ahead from the state to use the chemicals
after a debate over whether they would cause even more harm to the
environment.
   ``Our key objective is to achieve the appropriate level of
cleanup with the least amount of stress on the environment,'' said
Bob Mastracchio, Exxon's technical manager for the cleanup.
   This year's cleanup got under way May 1 with crews removing tar
by hand. Exxon expects to complete its work by mid-August under a
cleanup plan approved by the government's cleanup coordinator, said
Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef on March 24, 1989,
spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into the clear
waters of Prince William Sound.
   After the spill, thousands of cleanup workers and hundreds of
boats worked for weeks to clean hundreds of miles of shoreline.
Thousands of birds, mammals and other wildlife were killed in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Late Sunday, workers began spreading nitrogen and phosphorous
fertilizer in liquid and granular form. The chemicals promote the
growth of bacteria that eat oil.
   Three boats and 29 people were deployed to coat about 175 square
yards, Tucker said. Only three three or four workers were actually
applying the fertilizer. Most of the rest were federal, state or
company officials observing the work.
   To protect birds and other wildlife from the potentially harmful
chemicals, crews put out brightly-colored helium balloons and roped
off the treated areas with flags.
   The cleansing action of the tides will reduce the risk after the
first 24 hours, Exxon said.
   The company plans to use the fertilizer on about 400 sites. Last
year, 74 miles of shoreline were treated.
   A multi-agency team will monitor the sites for six weeks to help
judge the effectiveness of the technique, bioremediation, and
decide whether second applications of the fertilizer will be made
during the summer, Exxon said.
   State officials and some environmental groups have expressed
fears that the chemicals might further pollute the water or harm
wildlife.
   After weeks of debate, the state finally agreed with Exxon and
the Coast Guard that the technique should be used despite the risks.

   Rain drenched much of the Northeast today, and thunderstorms cut
a swath through the South.
   Today's forecast called for showers in the Pacific Northwest. A
band of thunderstorms was expected to stretch from central Texas
through North Carolina.
   Rain fell early today from Washington, D.C., to Portland, Maine,
and west to Cleveland. Forecasters said parts of Indiana and
Illinois also could expect rain.
   The National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm warnings
overnight for parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   On Sunday, thunderstorms rattled through parts of Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.
   In Alabama, trees downed by high winds damaged homes in Lamar
and Walker counties, and near Tuscumbia. Storm winds also downed
power lines and damaged cars around Birmingham. Winds gusted to 58
mph at Argo.
   In Georgia, storms felled trees and power lines near Alpharetta,
Cumming and Gainesville. Winds also downed trees at Westminster,
S.C.
   In Mississippi, hail pounded Clarksdale, Grenada Lake and
Greenwood, and winds gusted to 65 mph in Jackson and downed trees
and power lines in Warren County. Storms in central Louisiana
produced dime-size hail at Alexandria.
   In Missouri, a tornado tore through two trailer parks on the
edge of Rogersville, 12 miles east of Springfield, injuring up to
10 people. In southeastern Wyoming, storms spawned a tornado at
Cheyenne.
   The high temperature for the nation was 109 degrees at Laredo,
Texas.

   Jubilant seniors at Mills College brought
yellow balloons to graduation to celebrate their successful fight
to keep undergraduate men out of the women's school.
   Rain delayed the ceremonies for several hours Sunday but didn't
dampen the enthusiasm of the 428 graduating seniors.
   The liberal arts school announced May 3 it would admit men as
undergraduates to boost enrollment and revenue. Students boycotted
class, demonstrated and took over the campus for two weeks, and the
trustees dropped the idea Friday.
   Mills College has 777 students, including men in graduate
programs. Administrators wanted to boost enrollment to 1,000.
   The school's alumnae came up with financial pledges that should
help Mills preserve a $70 million endowment. They also promised to
help recruit more students.
   On Sunday, 178 women received bachelor's degrees. An additional
250 men and women were awarded graduate degrees. Because of the
shutdown, diplomas won't actually be delivered for several weeks,
pending verification of student records.
   During commencement, students held colorful umbrellas and yellow
balloons as ``a memento and a symbol of unity,'' said Shirley
Weishaar, associate director of the school's career center, which
distributed the items.
   Mills is one of three all-women colleges in California and one
of 94 colleges in the nation with all-female undergraduate classes.

   Thousands of people in at least five cities from San Francisco
to the nation's capital marched or lit candles to remember those
stricken with AIDS. Barbara Bush took part by putting lighted
candles in 10 White House windows.
   About 20,000 people marched with candles Sunday to San
Francisco's City Hall for a solemn reading of the names of recent
AIDS victims. As gospel music played through speakers, the crowd
shouted, ``We will not forget!'' after each name.
   Similar activities were held in New York, Washington, Salt Lake
City and Seattle in an annual observance organized by the
Mobilization Against AIDS, based in San Francisco.
   ``It helps to remember,'' said Harvey Maurer, an AIDS activist
at the San Francisco ceremony. He was diagnosed with the disease 1{
years ago.
   ``From an intellectual point of view I still can have hope that
we'll see a cure. But I also know that I keep losing people.''
   Mrs. Bush participated by placing a candle in each of 10 White
House windows facing Pennsylvania Avenue, said spokeswoman Anna
Peres. The candles were in the second-floor, residential portion of
the White House, she said.
   ``I think this is encouraging that the lights are in the White
House windows tonight. It's a wonderful symbolic gesture of
support,'' said Andy Ilves, spokesman for the Mobilization Against
AIDS.
   The Washington group Lifelink estimated 2,000 people lit candles
and walked around the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln
Memorial.
   In New York, about 25,000 people walked 6.2 miles and raised
nearly $4 million for the fight against AIDS, organizers said.
   ``We are here because we care, because we love life, because we
love each other,'' playwright-actor Harvey Fierstein said. The walk
benefited the Gay Men's Health Crisis, an AIDS service organization
in New York.
   Mayor David Dinkins addressed walkers at Lincoln Center,
reiterating his call for an end to prejudice.
   ``As we work together to conquer the health crisis of AIDS we
must also work to promote unity, to denounce discrimination and
division,'' he said.
   Several groups in Seattle also observed the vigil, first
organized in 1983 to draw attention to the toll AIDS was taking on
homosexuals.
   About 250 people gathered for a candlelight ceremony in Salt
Lake City to remember 186 Utah residents killed by the disease and
272 others diagnosed with it.
   ``You can either be living with AIDS or dying with AIDS,'' said
Carolyn Spriggs, whose son has the disease. ``We are raising him as
a child with AIDS who is living.''
   The largest and loudest contingent in San Francisco came from
the largely gay Castro District, where as many as 10,000 joined the
pilgrimage to City Hall, many dressed in black, most holding hands
or linked arm and arm, and some in drag.
   ``This is the 1,000 points of light that Bush hasn't looked
at,'' said Robert George, a member of the Interfaith AIDS
Coalition. ``We need more funding to help the AIDS programs which
are just strapped and overburdened.''

   Former hostage Frank Reed once traveled to
exotic places around the globe. Now he heads home nearly broke,
facing the likelihood of living with his wife and child in his
mother's small apartment.
   Held captive 42 months in the Middle East, Reed returns to this
Boston suburb, this weekend or early next week, from a Maryland
hospital.
   To friends and relatives, Reed, 57, was an almost
larger-than-life figure, an adventurer who studied at Harvard and
trekked to the North Pole, the jungles of Brazil and the Australian
outback before accepting a post at Beirut's International College
in 1977.
   ``He was a fellow who would take risks,'' said Reed's brother,
Edward. ``He stayed in Beirut even though he knew it was
dangerous.''
   In 1986, Reed was seized from his car by gunmen and held by
Moslem extremists for the next 3{ years.
   When he was released last month, a pale, gaunt Reed told of
being beaten when he tried to escape and of being chained and
blindfolded for months at a time.
   Reed's family and friends are preparing, as best they can, for
his return home. Reed has no job, little money and no home of his
own.
   ``A lot of pieces need to be put together,'' said Bob Langston,
his son-in-law. ``Medical care, housing, these all need to be dealt
with. A lot depends on his health.''
   Reed is still weak, and relatives say he has memory lapses,
apparently caused by beatings to the head. ``He remembers the past
very well but had troubles with things that happened the other
day,'' said his mother, Leota Sprague, 91.
   His wife, Fahima, holds a job at an insurance firm. She and her
9-year-old son, Tarek, have lived with Reed's mother in her
two-bedroom apartment for almost a year.
   Reed had money invested in his school in Beirut, Sprague said.
But that was lost when the school was bombed out.
   ``I was blessed, I had a job to come back to,'' said Jeremy
Levin, former Cable News Network bureau chief in Beirut who was
held by kidnappers for 13 months before gaining freedom in 1985.
``But the recovery will be slower for him. He has no job, so the
Reeds may have a problem. It could be a terrible burden on him.''
   Former hostages and psychiatric experts said Reed may also have
to overcome psychological hurdles to readjust to an ordinary life,
after having lived under extraordinary circumstances.
   Freed hostages also find they are sudden celebrities sought by
reporters and talk show hosts.
   ``I couldn't get back into the normal swing of things at
first,'' Levin said in a telephone interview from Washington. ``We
all did a lot of public speaking, and that put off the time of
getting into a normal routine.''
   Once the spotlight turns elsewhere, former hostages are left to
deal with the everyday world.
   ``When you're a hostage, you give up thinking about the future
because you have no future, you could be killed tomorrow,'' said
Brian Schulman, a psychiatrist in Bethesda, Md., who has counseled
Vietnam veterans and concentration camp victims. ``Then you're
released, and suddenly you have to think about mundane things like
getting a job.''
   ``All people know about Frank Reed is that he's been a
hostage,'' Schulman said. ``But hostages eventually become old
news, and that's when they have to re-establish their lives.''

   A single-engine plane missed a
foggy runway at Cuyahoga County Airport and crashed into a house,
killing the pilot, police said.
   Ken Kemper escaped out a window of the home and was not hurt
Sunday night. The crash destroyed his living room, said Fire Chief
William J. Heckler.
   The plane went down less than a half-mile from the airport,
hitting a tree, a pole, the ground and then the house, said Robert
Shea, manager of the airport east of Cleveland.
   The pilot's identity was not immediately released. Officials
said he was from Menton and was returning from South Carolina.
   Kemper said he had just gone into a back bedroom when he heard a
crash and saw a ball of flame. ``I thought the plane came right
down my driveway,'' he said.

   Cuban exiles sailed across the choppy
Florida Straits for a high-seas democracy rally at the edge of
Cuba's waters, where they threw wreaths and bottles carrying
messages overboard.
   Cuban patrol boats looked on but took no action against the
flotilla that left Sunday from Key West.
   Backers of the expedition said it was a demonstration against
Cuba's communist government and a celebration of the anniversary of
Cuba's independence from Spain.
   ``It was a very emotional moment for all the Cubans who
participated in this,'' said Julio Rebull of Miami.
   Some smaller boats among the 34 that started out turned back
because of 8-foot waves. The boats rendezvoused about 20 miles off
Cuba's northern coast, then sailed parallel to the coast for six
miles before heading back to Key West.
   For seven minutes, a Roman Catholic priest read prayers over the
radio to a Cuban radio monitor at a Havana lighthouse, Rebull said.
The operator acknowledged the message but made no further response.
   The current on the straits carried the flowers and bottles
north, away from Cuba.
   Coast Guard cutters monitored the flotilla by radar but provided
no escort. Coast Guard officials earlier warned the exiles to lodge
verbal protests but to go along peacefully if they were intercepted
by Cuban forces.
   At least one boat carrying a TV news crew from Miami had to turn
back in the middle of the windswept Gulf Stream because of
seasickness.

   A tornado tore through two trailer parks
on the edge of town, injuring at least 11 people, including two
children in critical condition, authorities said.
   A 3-year-old boy and his 6-month-old brother were found in the
rubble of a trailer home and were taken to St. John's Regional
Medical Center in nearby Springfield, said Rogersville Police Chief
Mike Crider.
   Several residents were cut by broken glass when the tornado hit
Sunday night, he said. The National Weather Service said nine
people were treated at hospitals in Springfield, 12 miles miles
west of Rogersville, and released.
   About a half dozen mobile homes were reported damaged or
destroyed at one trailer park and nine at another. Authorities had
to contain leaks from the propane lines and tanks that served homes
in one of the parks.
   ``I had just laid down and suddenly there was no warning or
anything, just a loud boom,'' Donna Manning said. ``A tree went
through my 14-year-old son's bedroom window and a limb went into
the hallway.''
   She said her son was not in the bedroom when the storm hit.
   Crider said damage would exceed $2 million. Five businesses were
destroyed or heavily damaged, including a camper shell
manufacturer, a tanker truck repair service and an auction barn, he
said.
   In Rogersville and elsewhere in southwestern Missouri, the
violent weather also brought golf ball-size hail. Winds up to 90
mph blew out windows and downed power lines and tree limbs.

   Stan Stephens has run charter boats out of
this port town for 20 years, but this is the first season Bligh
Reef rated a mention on his tourist brochure.
   A growing number of tourists want a look at the site of the
nation's largest oil spill, even though only a buoy marks the spot
where the Exxon Valdez rammed the reef.
   ``We're including that in our new schedule to make sure we swing
by it because it has become part of the history of the sound,''
Stephens said. ``Everyone last year asked. We had thousands of oil
questions.''
   Inquiries from prospective tourists for the summer were up 30
percent over winter, the Valdez Convention and Visitors Bureau said.
   Marilyn Mitchell of the Valdez Chamber of Commerce chalks up
some of the interest to ``morbid curiosity.''
   ``I think it's human nature,'' she said. ``People want to see
where things happen. There's been a lot of interest in people
wanting to come and just see where the ship went off the reef.''
   It's too soon to know how many people actually will visit, but
bookings at some motels, bed and breakfasts and charter companies
are going strong, said the visitors bureau director, Gary
Kranenberg.
   Indications are that this year's tourist visits may not only
rebound to 1988 levels of about 100,000, the highest on record, but
could surpass that number by up to 15 percent.
   About a dozen travel writers normally come to Valdez before the
tourist season. This year 150 dropped in, Kranenberg said.
   Most visitors come to Valdez for sightseeing and fishing. The
spill, which occurred in March 1989, simply made more people aware
of the town's scenic beauty, tourism officials say.
   Still, this year's tourists want to know where the oil was.
   ``We didn't get down to exactly where the spill happened, but
we're all curious about it,'' said Wilbur Langley, 55, of Lecanto,
Fla., who took a charter tour of the sound last week with his wife
and other tourists.
   ``We were interested and asking the captain about it. He
explained everything to us.''
   Even if tourists get to the reef, it is under water with a
single buoy for a marker. The sound's oil-tainted shores are even
less accessible and some will be bustling with Exxon cleanup crews
this summer.
   ``A lot of people are disappointed there's nothing to see,''
said Howard Clifford, spokesman for Seattle-based Princess Tours,
which runs cruise ships into Prince William Sound.
   Charter plane and helicopter services also get requests to take
tourists to see remnants of the spill.
   ``I tell them it's at least a one-hour round trip at about $548
an hour,'' said Walt Woodrow, manager of ERA Helicopters. ``Not
many of them want to do it after they hear that.''

   The dollar firmed in European trading this
morning, supported by indications that U.S. interest rates will not
be reduced again soon.
   Gold was higher.
   The dollar closed at 153.25 yen, up 0.35 yen from last Friday's
close. In four trading days, the dollar has gained 1.95 yen.
   Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 153.35 yen.
   ``There was no major market-affecting news other than slowdown
of the lowering of U.S. interest rates,'' said a dealer with
Daiichi Kangyo Bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``But I don't expect the dollar's upswing to continue much
further.''
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
   _1.6580 West German marks, up from 1.6478
   _1.4165 Swiss francs, up from 1.4045
   _5.5890 French francs, up from 5.5555
   _1.8605 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8550
   _1219.50 Italian lire, up from 1212.00
   _$1.1765 Canadian, down from $1.1782
   The British pound was quoted at $1.6930 from $1.6910 late Friday.
   Within the European Monetary System the lira was trading
steadily after Italy's discount rate was cut by one point to 12.5
percent.
   Italy lowered its discount rate Saturday, citing the need to
restore stability to the EMS after the lira had strengthened
significantly against the other European currencies this year. The
lira's rise against the French franc had been a particular source
of tension, and the Bank of Italy intervened heavily last week to
support the franc.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $373.40 a
troy ounce this morning, up from $369.75 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, gold was quoted at $373.40 an ounce, up from $370.60
bid late Friday.
   In Hong Kong, gold dropped 22 cents an ounce from Saturday's
level to close Monday at $374.08.
   Silver bullion traded at $5.14 a troy ounce, up from $5.06 late
Friday.

<TEXT>
   A toothy beauty named Petunia captivated
judges for the third time in five years to become the most
beautiful burro in Texas.
   Petunia ``has a fine set of teeth,'' said Henry Wolff Jr., a
newspaper columnist who founded an annual beauty contest for the
pack animals under the auspices of the Better Burro Bureau.
   The judges picked Petunia in 1986, last year and again Sunday.
   Burros were brought to Texas by Spanish settlers in the early
1700s.
   Dictionaries point out that burros and donkeys are asses, but
Wolff, who works for The Victoria Advocate, said he makes it a
point to avoid using that word in reference to the competition he
began in 1983.
   ``We do say, `This is the place where people can come and show
their blank-blank-blank if they've got one.' That's the fun of
it,'' he said.
   Entrants are dressed up in costumes. Nearly 4,000 people
attended the contest at The Texas Zoo.
   One contender this year did not help her cause when she walked
down the runway.
   ``Let's just say she wet down the stage,'' Wolff said. ``I think
she had been saving up for the contest.''

<HEAD>Report: Coast Guardsmen Helped Cocaine Smugglers in Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coast Guardsmen in the Florida Keys have been
jailed for helping cocaine smugglers, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
   But the alleged corruption outlined in the report aired Sunday
on NBC's ``Expose'' program actually was detected and dealt with
two years ago, according to Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Karonis, spokesman for
the Coast Guard's Miami-based southeastern district.
   NBC cited unidentified federal authorities and Tom Cash, chief
of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office in Miami, as
saying the guardsmen disabled patrol boats and sold drug agents'
codes to smugglers.
   Raids by federal authorities on smugglers' homes turned up
records of secret radio frequencies, patrol schedules and codes
used in radio transmissions for every law enforcement agency in the
Florida Keys, NBC reported.
   Federal authorities investigating the relationship between
smugglers and U.S. Coast Guardsmen have named the case ``Operation
Tempest.''
   NBC reported that at least 15 guardsmen assigned to the
Islamorada station worked either for or with the smugglers they
were assigned to catch.
   Four guardsmen stationed at Islamorada, all crew members of a
high-speed boat used to intercept smugglers, are in jail for taking
cocaine from the smugglers, NBC reported.
   ``The Coast Guard people involved were brought to justice and
are in jail right now. The system works and they're paying for
it,'' Karonis said after the broadcast.
   The NBC report did not say when the alleged corruption occurred.
   Karonis, contacted late Sunday by the Associated Press, said the
Coast Guard detected the alleged conspiracy _ and stopped it _ back
in 1988.
   Art Sola, the commander of the crew that stole cocaine from
smugglers for themselves, was convicted on drug charges handed down
in July 1988 by federal prosecutors in North Carolina, Karonis said.
   Karonis said other guardsmen were indicted a short time later.
They were convicted in separate trials later that year, he said. He
added that that few newspapers reported the case at the time.
   Sola told NBC he and his fellow guardsmen decided one afternoon
to steal a kilogram of cocaine from a shipment they found floating
in the Atlantic Ocean 15 miles offshore.
   The cocaine, according to the report, was worth as much as
$16,000 _ about the same as the guardsmen's annual salary at the
time.
   ``It's easy. It's very easy. It's a lifestyle down there.
Everybody knows somebody who's involved in drugs or smuggling. It's
very easy to get hooked on,'' Sola said in a jailhouse interview.
   NBC reported that another guardsman, identified on ``Expose'' as
Bobby Gosnell, also got caught up in drug smuggling. Gosnell, NBC
reported, bought a $500,000 home with an airstrip after leaving the
Coast Guard.
   But Gosnell wound up murdered, shot in the chest in a dispute
over whether he should cooperate with the federal investigation,
NBC said.
   Karonis, contacted at home late Sunday, said he had no further
details on the case, but he expressed confidence that little
corruption remains at the Islamorada office today.
   ``Every agency has bad apples, but we're confident the vast
majority of Coast Guard people are honest and do their job every
day,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Lava from Kilauea Volcano destroyed yet
another house and posed an immediate threat to several more, and a
federal disaster relief team arrived to help the victims of the
seven-year eruption.
   One house was 100 feet in front of the seven-mile-long river of
molten rock, Craig Hindle, a Hawaii County civil defense spokesman,
said late Sunday.
   The house and six others were expected to be destroyed in 24
hours by the flow that was filling up low spots and then oozing
forward, Hindle said.
   Earlier Sunday, the eruption that began Jan. 3, 1983, claimed
its 143rd house. Just 30 homes remain in Kalapana; 67 have been
destroyed since April 4.
   Before traveling to Hawaii Island, members of the federal
disaster relief team met with local officials in Honolulu.
   President Bush issued a disaster declaration Friday for this
region of Hawaii Island.
   Some victims eligible for disaster relief had their homes
destroyed seven years ago, while other homeowners have been unable
to collect insurance because, although rendered useless by
surrounding lava flows, the houses are still standing.

<HEAD>Iraq Invites Syria's Assad to Attend Arab Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Iraqi official met today with
Syrian President Hafez Assad to deliver an invitation to an Arab
League summit.
   It was the first time a senior Iraqi official has visited Syria
since the feuding Arab countries broke diplomatic relations in
1979. Assad and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein are bitter enemies.
   Iraqi Justice Minister Akram Abdul-Qader arrived today aboard a
special Iraqi Airways jet carrying an invitation to the May 28
summit from Saddam.
   Abdul-Qader later met with Assad and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa, according to Assad's presidential spokesman,
Gibrane Kouriem.
   There was no immediate word on Assad's response to the
invitation.
   So far, Assad has resisted appeals from Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and other Arab leaders to attend the summit in Baghdad, the
Iraqi capital, in the interest of Arab unity.
   Saddam has called the summit to discuss Arab concerns about the
expected influx of tens of thousands of Soviet Jewish emigrants to
Israel as well as a perceived ``Israeli and imperialist threat'' to
Iraq.
   Saddam is seeking to rally support after Britain and the United
States accused Iraq of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers.
Iraq denied it is developing nuclear weapons but threatened to use
chemical weapons against Israel if attacked.
   The Iraqis are also seeking to rally support after Iraq-bound
shipments said to contain parts for a ``super gun'' capable of
hitting Israel were seized in Britain, Greece, Turkey and Italy.
   In a related development, Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Baghdad today to meet with Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, who invited him to the summit.
   The PLO announced Friday that Arafat had sent a letter to
Damascus urging Syria to reverse its stand boycotting the meeting.
   Mediation efforts earlier this month by Saudi Arabia, Jordan and
Egypt all failed. Assad has remained adamant that neither he nor
other Syrian officials will attend.
   Assad has insisted that the location and agenda of the summit
must first be discussed at an emergency meeting of foreign
ministers of the 22-member Arab League in Tunisia.
   But Iraq has said the summit will go ahead as planned in
Baghdad, preceded by a foreign ministers meeting on May 22 in the
Iraqi capital to set the agenda.
   Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the Baath Arab
Socialist Party.
   Their feud deepened during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war when
Syria supported the Iranians, while most Arab countries sided with
Iraq.
   Saddam, in turn, has supported Christian factions in Lebanon
that are opposed to Syria, thwarting Assad's efforts to end the
15-year-old Lebanese civil war.

   Radical Jewish activists jeered Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu outside a church after he delivered a
sermon there, prompting the church's officials to cancel an outdoor
reception that was to follow.
   ``Why do you hate Jews?'' members of the militant Jewish Defense
League shouted Sunday at the Nobel laureate.
   ``Tell him to lay off Israel,'' said JDL spokesman Irv Rubin,
apparently referring to Tutu's support of a Palestinian state.
   The Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints Episcopal Church,
said Tutu was not angered by the protesters.
   ``Please let them say what they want to say, because in my
country they are not allowed to do that,'' Regas quoted Tutu as
saying.
   Before the confrontation, Tutu had delivered an hourlong sermon
to an overflow crowd. Worshipers began lining up about 7 a.m. to
hear the 9 a.m. service. Up to 2,000 people were turned away and
watched outside on TV sets.
   The outspoken church leader touched on various subjects,
including world hunger and South Africa, and referred to those
gathered as ``God's collaborators'' and said they could change the
world and bring an end to injustice and oppression.
   Tutu is on a fund-raising and speaking tour of Southern
California.
   On Saturday, he visited Disneyland with his wife, two daughters
and 3-year-old grandson.
   ``I think this was a tremendous inspiration from God to have
this kind of place for people to come and unwind and discover how
human we are when we are childlike,'' he said in praise of the
theme park.

<HEAD>Agents Seize $25 Million in Erroneous Drug Bust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal and local narcotics agents mistakenly
seized $25 million during what they believed was one of the Dallas
area's largest ever drug-tainted cash shipments, the Dallas Times
Herald reported today.
   Agents converged on an American Airlines jetliner arriving at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Wednesday after an
anonymous tip led them to the baggage compartment where they found
eight canvas bags filled with $25 million.
   But the agents later learned that the transfer of cash was
legitimate.
   A commercial New York bank, which authorities declined to name,
was transporting currency from the San Antonio branch of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said Phil Jordan, special agent in
charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office in Dallas.
   The money was loaded at the San Antonio airport; after its
arrival at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, it was to be transferred
by armed, private security guards to a New York-bound jet, West
said.
   Apparently, the courier accompanying the shipment told someone
at the San Antonio airport he was transferring a large amount of
cash. That person called local authorities, who then alerted
airport officials.
   ``Money is transferred in cargo holds all the time,'' said
Robert Boykin of the Federal Reserve in Dallas. ``There's nothing
unusual about that.''
   But DEA officials said they disagree with Boykin and plan to
continue investigating the transfer.
   ``We have never seen it before. It was a strange thing to all of
us,'' said Danny West, a DEA agent in Fort Worth. ``It was unusual
that they would put that kind of money into the belly of an
airplane.''

<HEAD>Mayor Preaches Peace in Face of Heightening Racial Tensions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins preached racial conciliation
after a week of heightening citywide strife, then led a memorial
parade for Martin Luther King Jr. through midtown Manhattan.
   ``Tensions are threatening to plunge New York into a cycle of
fear and frustration that could tear us apart,'' Dinkins said
Sunday at the Salem United Methodist Church in Harlem.
   He urged the city to begin healing recent wounds before the
scheduled visit next month of South African anti-apartheid leader
Nelson Mandela.
   ``When Mandela arrives, I hope he will find a city at peace, not
a city tearing itself apart,'' Dinkins told worshipers.
   In the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, marchers for racial harmony
met pickets chanting for the boycott of two Korean-owned grocery
stores Sunday as a large police riot squad looked on.
   No confrontation occurred, said police who outnumbered opposing
advocates by 3-to-2.
   The store boycotts and the severe beating of a Vietnamese man by
a young black man combined with two jury verdicts in the Brooklyn
racial mob-killing case of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins to inflame
racial tensions.
   Blacks were angered on Friday when a jury acquitted the accused
mob leader, 19-year-old Keith Mondello, of murder and manslaughter
charges. He was convicted on lesser charges. A day earlier, another
jury convicted Joseph Fama, also 19, of second-degree murder in the
Aug. 23 shooting.
   At the church in a burned-out Harlem neighborhood, Dinkins knelt
alone before the altar and buried his face in his hands.
   Then he stepped to the pulpit.
   ``We all come from somewhere else. We came here to escape
prejudice. All of our people share an ancestry of oppression,'' he
said.
   Dinkins praised Erasmus Hall High School students who last week
defied the store boycott and shopped at one of the Korean groceries.
   The boycott was triggered by accusations that a black woman was
attacked in a store in January by Korean-American employees who
suspected her of shoplifting.
   Some in the church crowd punctuated the mayor's words with
outbursts of affirmation and an elderly woman repeated, ``Bless
you! Bless you!''
   Later, Dinkins led a mostly black throng of marchers in the
Martin Luther King Jr. memorial parade up Fifth Avenue.
   ``This year's parade is more important than any other,''
Cardinal John O'Connor said as he greeted the crowd on the steps of

   Silk-costumed Korean schoolchildren joined black students atop

whose name is Dinkins' favorite term for New York's ethnic

   A weekend poll revealed that 75 percent of New York residents
believe race relations have worsened.
   The Daily News-Eyewitness News Poll of 670 people, 213 of whom
are black, found both races agreed that racial tensions are
building. Three percent said relations were better and 20 percent
said they were the same.
   The 75-percent figure was up greatly from August 1985, when a
similar poll found 20 percent felt race relations were worse, 30
percent said they were better, and 43 percent said they were the
same.
   The poll had a margin for error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage
points.

   Israeli soldiers
fatally shot three Palestinians and wounded 94 others today in
violent protests over the massacre of seven Palestinians by an
Israeli gunman.
   The suspect, Ami Popper, appeared in court today with his feet
shackled and under heavy guard.
   Magistrate David Muallem extended Popper's detention for 15 days
and ordered him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Police said
the suspect was suicidal after breaking up with his girlfriend.
   Black flags flew from cars and rooftops in the West Bank and
graffiti called for armed struggle against Israeli rule of the
occupied territories.
   Seven Palestinians were shot and killed by Israeli soldiers and
more than 700 were wounded in rioting after Sunday's massacre in
the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Letzion.
   The Palestinians were killed as a group of Arab laborers from
Gaza waited at the Roses junction. Witnesses said Popper ordered 50
workers to sit in a line, then opened fire with an assault rifle,
killing seven and wounding 11.
   Sunday's rioting was the worst bloodshed in the 29-month-old
uprising since April 15, 1988, when 17 Palestinians died in riots
after PLO military leader Khalil Wazir was slain in Tunis,
reportedly by Israeli commandos. In recent months, the level of
violence had declined.
   Today's dead brought to 705 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers and civilians since the uprising against Israeli
rule began in December 1987. Another 216 have been slain by fellow
Arabs as suspected collaborators. Forty-three Israelis also have
been killed.
   The unrest persisted today in the occupied lands and spilled
over into Arab areas of Israel. The army poured in hundreds of
reinforcements and clamped a curfew on about 1.1 million
Palestiniams in the occupied Gaza Strip and much of the West Bank.
   U.S. State Department officials called on Israel's army to use
restraint and prevent further bloodshed.
   The most intense violence occurred in the Gaza Strip where the
massacre victims lived. Stone-throwing protests broke out in at
least 10 neighborhoods and refugee camps in defiance of the curfew.
   In Gaza City's Sabra quarter, troops shot in the head a
17-year-old girl, Manal Suleiman Mohammed al-Dairy, who died on the
operating table at Shifa Hospital, Arab reports said.
   Safia Suleiman Jarhoon, 55, died in Nasser Hospital after being
struck in the chest by a bullet during a clash in the Khan Yunis
refugee camp, the reports said.
   In Rafah, Arab reporters said 22-year-old Imad Ahmad al-Atamneh,
was fatally wounded in the neck during clashes in the Shabura
refugee camp.
   An additional 94 Palestinians suffered wounds from either live
ammunition or plastic bullets, the reports said.
   The army confirmed there was unrest in Gaza and that several
people were wounded but said it was checking other reports.
   In the northern Israeli city of Nazareth, Israeli Arabs staged a
sympathy strike, and violence also broke out there. Arab witnesses
said 10 youths were wounded by police gunfire and six were arrested.
   A half-dozen firebombs were thrown at police and four officers
were injured by stones and bottles. A pall of black smoke hung over
the city, roads were blocked with garbage carts and burning tires
and Israeli cars were stoned.
   A crew of the British television agency Visnews came under
gunfire from Israeli police during the unrest, according to an
agency employee. No injuries resulted.
   Israel radio said outlawed PLO flags fluttered from electricity
poles in other Israeli-Arab towns. It said Swastikas were painted
on walls in Haifa and stones blocked the streets in the town of
Kfar Kassem.
   In the Jabaliya refugee camp, where the intefadeh _ or uprising
_ began nearly 2{ years ago, roads were covered with stones and
columns of black smoke could be seen from burning tires.
   Youths hurled stones at a convoy of four army vehicles that
brought a press pool into Gaza for the first time since rioting
began on Sunday.
   In Amman, Jordan, police said a Palestinian gunman shot and
wounded 10 people including nine French tourists aboard a tourist
bus today. Police said the man also had a dagger and some people
might have been stabbed. The man said he was taking revenge for the
Palestinian slayings in Israel, according to police.
   And in Nicosia, Cyprus, an Arab caller contacted a Western news
agency and claimed responsibility for the slaying of an Israeli
restaurant owner Sunday night. He also said it was in revenge for
Sunday's massacre.
   Slogans spray-painted on walls in Bethlehem said, ``yes to armed
struggle'' and followed the lead of Palestinian leaders in blaming
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government for creating a climate
of anti-Arab violence.
   Maj. Gen. Natan Vilnai, commander of troops in Gaza, said he was
concerned there would be more revenge attacks.
   ``I believe the other side is going to do its utmost to give new
life to the uprising,'' he said. ``There is no doubt we have a
grave problem here with the growing number of people who have a
personal account to settle with us.''

<HEAD>Increase Of Tuberculosis Due to AIDS Virus Poses New Health Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE SCHOROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again
because it's posing new health threats with its connection to the
AIDS virus.
   A 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in Newark, N.J.,
has caught the attention of health officials, who had been
previously recording with satisfaction a slow, steady decrease in
TB cases over the last few decades.
   They attribute the 5 percent national increase in TB cases in
1989 to the ravages of the AIDS virus, which destroys the body's
immune system and leaves victims open to TB infection, Dr. Philip
C. Hopewell of San Francisco General Hospital said Sunday.
   Hopewell and other health officials discussed the link between
AIDS and TB during the a four-day World Conference on Lung Health
in Boston, which ends Wednesday.
   About 4 percent of Americans identified as having the AIDS virus
also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said
Dr. Dixie E. Snider Jr., director of the division of tuberculosis
control at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The American
Lung Association estimates that 20,000 Americans a year develop TB.
   In parts of Africa, where AIDS is already a health risk,
tuberculosis has become epidemic, said Dr. Annik Rouillon,
executive director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis
and Lung Disease in Paris.
   ``The combination of the two is really catastrophic,'' she said.
   Snider stressed that tuberculosis, unlike AIDS, is a curable
disease and called for TB screenings at drug rehabilitation
programs, prisons or other places where AIDS tests are being
administered.
   Snider also said doctors should administer TB tests to all
persons testing positive for the HIV virus since TB may not be
readily diagnosed in AIDS patients.
   ``It's important we get control of the situation,'' he said.
   In Wyoming, the Centers for Disease Control recorded no new
cases of TB in 1989, demonstrating that it is a condition that can
be controlled and cured, according to Dr. Lee B. Reichman, director
of the pulmonary division of the University of Medicine and
Dentistry in New Jersey.
   ``I have never heard of a rise of the magnitude seen in New
Jersey or, on the other hand, the hope generated by no cases in one
state,'' Reichman said.
   Moreover, unlike AIDS, TB is a highly contagious disease that
can be spread by airborne particles coughed up by a person with
untreated, clinically active pulmonary TB. Untreated, tuberculosis
kills about 50 percent of its victims within two years, according
to the Centers for Disease Control.
   Snider said sustained contact is necessary for TB transmission,
and would not pose new problems for AIDS victims already fighting
discrimination in jobs and housing. However, he noted that there
had been an increase in positive TB tests among AIDS health workers.
   Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium that commonly affects the
lungs but can attack almost any organ. For the last three decades,
it has been preventable and curable through multiple drug therapy,
Snider said.
   Snider said 10 million to 15 million Americans have been
infected with the tuberculosis germ, but only a small percentage of
them develop the disease because their immune system was strong
enough to prevent the disease from developing.
   If, however, a person's immune system is impaired by poor
nutrition or weakened by the HIV virus, people can develop active
TB.
   ``TB is long known as an opportunistic organism,'' Hopewell said.
   The doctors said U.S. minority groups have become increasing
susceptible to TB. Snider said there has been a 150 percent
increased in cases of TB among young blacks in New York City.
   Tuberculosis can be effectively treated, even in AIDS patients,
underscoring efforts to screen persons for the disease, the doctor
said.
   Reichman noted that most American have forgotten about the
problems of TB; from 1981 to 1984, TB cases declined an average of
6 percent per year according to the Centers for disease control.
   But, he said, ``TB is back with a vengeance.''
   While associated with poverty and crowded living conditions, TB
through history has ravaged both the poor and the famous. TB
victims include Henry David Thoreau, Washington Irving, Franz
Kafka, Ring Lardner, Somerset Maugham and Vivien Leigh.
   An estimated 3 million persons a year die worldwide from TB,
according to the American Lung Association.

<HEAD>Attorney General Denies He Protected Aide During Leak
Investigation</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf to remove redundant full reference to Ayer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has denied
that he tried to cover up when a top aide showed deception on a lie
detector test while the Justice Department was investigating news
leaks.
   Thornburgh said Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer, the
agency's departing No. 2 official, was ``sadly misinformed'' in
criticizing how the case was handled.
   Ayer, who has resigned effective Friday, has charged that
Thornburgh mishandled the Justice Department's investigation in an
attempt to protect Robert S. ``Robin'' Ross, a longtime Thornburgh
aide.
   ``The attorney general was participating in an effort to prevent
appropriate disclosure and evaluation through established
procedures of the activities that earlier this week resulted in
Robin Ross' abrupt removal from office,'' Ayer was quoted as saying
in Sunday's Los Angeles Times.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity have told The
Associated Press that Ross and another veteran Thornburgh aide,
David Runkel, showed deception on polygraph tests. The tests were
given as part of the department's attempt to find who leaked
information to reporters about an investigation into alleged
financial irregularities involving Rep. William Gray, D-Pa.
   Thornburgh, appearing Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' program, replied, ``Absolutely not'' when asked if he
tried to conceal Ross's performance on the lie detector test.
   ``We conducted an investigation into leaks. There was no
evidence that tied any person on my staff to the unauthorized
disclosure of that information,'' Thornburgh said.
   The attorney general also said that failing a polygraph test
``isn't evidence of wrongdoing _ not in our courts of law.''
   Thornburgh said he was saddened that Ayer ``feels that he has to
lash out against his former colleagues, but there is no basis in
fact for that kind of story.''
   The Justice Department has had a series of high-level personnel
changes since Ayer announced May 11 that he was leaving.
   Ross resigned three days later as Thornburgh's executive
assistant to head a new international division. He said he plans to
leave the department in two or three months. Runkel was reassigned
from serving as spokesman, taking on the new title of director of
communications.
   In the Los Angeles Times interview, Ayer criticized the way
Thornburgh dealt with the Gray case. Thornburgh had ordered the
investigation into the leaks _ which Democrats charged were
politically motivated _ last spring while Gray was running for the
House majority whip post.
   Ayer said Thornburgh tried to keep the results of the leak
investigation out of the hands of the department's internal
watchdog agency, the Office of Professional Responsibility.
Unsuccessful in that attempt, Thornburgh then refused to follow the
unit's recommendation for further investigation, Ayer told the
newspaper.
   Ayer did not return a telephone call Sunday seeking comment.
   Thornburgh reported to Congress in September that the criminal
investigation of the Gray leak failed to identify the source of the
story.
   The attorney general told Congress the head of OPR had concurred
with the conclusion to drop the investigation. But Ayer said the
internal watchdog agency had never seen the report.
   When Ayer and two other top officials suggested to Thornburgh on
Jan. 30 that he remove himself from the case and turn it over to
the watchdog agency, the attorney general ``rejected our advice out
of hand,'' Ayer said.
   Ultimately the case went to OPR, after prodding by Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   After the OPR review was finished, Thornburgh turned the issue
over to Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, who concurred with the
attorney general's decision not to discipline any department
officials.

<HEAD>Teen-age Mutant Turtles Exist Offscreen, Too Sick to Fight Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARATHON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teen-age mutant turtles exist offscreen,
but they are too sick to fight crime or eat pizza.
   The unhappy green sea turtles suffer from an Elephant Manlike
disease called fibropapilloma that causes tumors internally and on
their eyes, mouths, necks, flippers, jaws and tails.
   ``Some tumors get larger than a softball and often reoccur,''
said Dr. Elliot Jacobson, a professor of wildlife medicine at the
University of Florida. ``They make the turtle grotesque. Teen-age
mutant green turtles are for real.''
   Afflicted turtles have been found off the Florida Keys, in the
Indian River Lagoon on Florida's east coast, the Caribbean and near
the Hawaiian Islands.
   In the Keys, the plague is so widespread that experts say 50
percent of the endangered green sea turtles are sick or dying from
fibropapilloma, which causes them to become blind or drown.
   ``It's an epidemic among green sea turtles comparable to AIDS in
humans,'' said Jacobson, who is heading a yearlong research project.
   Fibropapilloma was first identified by marine biologists in
1938. Its cause is unknown, but the strongest theory blames a virus
possibly aggravated by water pollution, Jacobson said recently.
   Scientists are unsure how many green turtles are left in the
world, but they are considered an endangered species. They feed on
seagrass and marine plants.
   Between 1983 and 1989, 134 green sea turtles were found dead,
Jacobson said. Seventy had fibropapilloma. Hardest hit were turtles
in the teen-age stages of life.
   ``It's hard to find a turtle that is healthy and free of
growths,'' said Tina Brown, a conservationist and Keys charter boat
captain.
   She and Richard Moretti recruited Jacobson to study the disease
at the Hidden Harbor Marine Environmental Project center, Moretti's
state-licensed marine sanctuary on Key Vaca, where Marathon is
located.
   Six healthy turtles on loan to the Cleveland and the Toledo zoos
were returned to Florida this month to participate in the study.
Five others from Clearwater, found to be free of fibropapilloma but
suffering handicaps, round out a study group.
   The 11 turtles are being housed in an 800-gallon fiberglass
tank, where they will be infected and exposed to the disease in
hopes of finding its agent and ultimately the key to a serum.
   Before fibropapilloma, the most serious threat to the species
was its popularity as the main ingredient in soup. In the 1950s, a
federal law was passed prohibiting the sale or import of green sea
turtles.
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are cartoon creations depicting pet
turtles transformed into pizza-eating, martial arts-loving crime
fighters. They were recently introduced in live-action form to the
movies, where they vaulted to box office success.

   Doctors have begun tests on Stormie Jones to
determine whether the 12-year-old is rejecting her second
transplanted liver.
   The world's longest surviving heart-liver transplant patient
returned to Pittsburgh on Sunday from her home in White Settlement,
Texas, after routine tests revealed high liver enzyme levels _ a
sign of possible organ rejection.
   ``They wanted to get it under control before it got to be a big
problem,'' said her mother, Lois ``Suzie'' Purcell, who traveled to
Pittsburgh with Stormie. ``Her numbers had been real good up until
the last couple of weeks.''
   Stormie was listed in fair condition today at Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh. She walked into the hospital and met
briefly with reporters at the behest of staff members who wanted to
assure the public she was not critically ill.
   ``Remember I'm getting paid for this,'' she joked. ``And this is
just for five minutes.''
   Stormie said she felt fine and was not experiencing any symptoms.
   Her evaluation is expected to take several days. In the
meantime, doctors plan to give Stormie an experimental
anti-rejection drug intravenously, hospital spokeswoman Sue
Cardillo said. Stormie usually takes the drug, FK-506, orally and
at a lower dose.
   At age 6, Stormie received a new heart and liver at Children's
in 1984 to control a congenital condition that left her cholesterol
levels 10 times higher than normal.
   Before the operation, Stormie had suffered two heart attacks and
had undergone two triple coronary bypass operations.
   Stormie received another liver Feb. 20 after doctors discovered
hepatitis had damaged her donor liver. Her heart was unaffected.

   Universal Studios Florida opens its doors
to the public today for three weeks of ``sneak previews'' of a
Hollywood-style attraction expected to draw up to 6 million
visitors in its first year.
   Guests will pay slightly more than half-price and take in about
half of the major rides and shows that will be functioning at the
444-acre Orlando complex.
   The $600 million attraction will officially open June 7.
   Universal, owned by California-based MCA Inc. and Rank
Organisation PLC of London, is going up against stiff competition.
   The Disney-MGM Studios theme park, which opened a year ago just
a few miles down the highway, is based on a similar concept. It
reported about 8 million clicks of its turnstiles during that
period.
   Universal, which relied heavily on filmmaker Steven Spielberg's
advice and creativity, will spend $110 million in marketing the
Florida park before the year is out, officials said.
   Not to be outdone, Disney has stepped up its own marketing
campaign for its three Florida attractions: the Magic Kingdom,
Epcot Center and the 135-acre Disney-MGM Studios. Entertainment
analysts say the company is spending at least $50 million this year
on advertising.
   Disney officials underestimated the appeal of their studio park,
and Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner earlier this year announced
a 10-year expansion plan that would double its size.
   In the head-to-head competition with Disney, Universal
executives emphasize the new park's larger size, the greater number
of rides and shows and what they consider more sophisticated
technology.
   ``Across the board, we're going to deliver a more impressive
entertainment experience,'' MCA Vice President Jay Stein said in a
recent interview.
   Universal's major lure is Hollywood's great movies. ``See the
Stars. Ride the Movies,'' is its theme.
   Top shows are based on King Kong, E.T. the Extraterrestrial,
Jaws the killer shark, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and other
spectaculars.
   ``We've made the movie experience something that fans can see,
feel, touch and smell,'' said Spielberg.
   After its grand opening, the theme park segment of the complex
will feature 15 major rides and shows and a ``back lot'' tour with
50 locations, including Hollywood Boulevard, a New England village,
the San Francisco Wharf and New York street sets.
   ``Sneak Preview'' tickets are $15.95 for adults and $12.95 for
children. After June 7, when all rides and shows are operating,
tickets will be almost twice that much.

<TEXT>
   Interim President Ion Iliescu, a
former Communist, appeared headed for a landslide victory today
after Romania's first free elections in 53 years, but opponents
complained of fraud.
   The first official returns showed Iliescu with an overwhelming
lead in the presidential race. His National Salvation Front
appeared to be headed for victory in the parliamentary elections,
which would allow him to govern without forming a coalition with
the opposition.
   With more than 2 million ballots counted from Sunday's election,
Iliescu won 89 percent to 8 percent for the National Liberal
Party's candidate, Radu Campeanu, and 3 percent for Ion Ratiu of
the National Peasant Party.
   A West German exit poll of 14,539 voters showed Iliescu winning
83 percent of the votes nationwide. Campeanu was second with 11
percent, and Ratiu had 6 percent.
   The chief U.S. observer of the elections said Romania had taken
``a very giant step toward democracy,'' but that allegations of
fraud must be assessed before the United States determines whether
the election was free.
   Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers of New Mexico urged the government to
establish a freer press and set up an independent panel or allow
the courts to investigate allegations of campaign and voting
irregularities.
   But others among the 500 foreign observers said that although
there were some irregularities, they were not significant enough to
alter the outcome.
   The two opposition candidates alleged numerous instances of
election fraud. Ratiu said Carruthers' assessment of the election
would mislead the American people and President Bush.
   ``There was no semblance of democracy about it,'' Ratiu said.
   The Front took power during the bloody December revolution in
which Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted and executed
after 24 years of rule.
   One of the main opposition charges against Iliescu and the Front
was their refusal to relinquish control over radio, television and
newsprint. The opposition argued that control of the airwaves gave
the Front an unfair advantage in the campaign.
   The Central Electoral Bureau estimated that at least 85 percent
of Romania's 16.8 million eligible voters cast ballots for
president and 506 representatives to the two-chamber Parliament.
   The Front won a projected 66 percent of vote for seats in
parliament, said the exit poll, conducted by the West German
polling group INFAS at the invitation of the Romanian government.
   In second place was the National Liberal Party with about 10
percent of the votes, the poll said. The party representing the
country's 2 million Hungarian minority had 6 percent, the
Ecological Movement had 5 percent and the Peasant Party had 3.5 to
4 percent, according to the poll. No margin of error was given.
   The projected victory for the front would break a string of
victories by centrist and conservative political parties in free
elections held elsewhere in Eastern Europe following the ouster of
old Communist regimes.
   Communist reformers were overwhelmingly defeated in elections
earlier this year in East Germany and Hungary.
   Iliescu, a 60-year-old former Communist Party secretary who fell
out of favor with Ceausescu, praised citizens for their high
turnout and calm behavior, the state news agency Rompress reported.
   Iliescu appeared to have capitalized on his standing as interim
president. He also gained popular credibility by opposing Ceausescu
in 1971 and then suffering demotion.
   The Front, a loose grouping of former Communists, workers and
technocrats, advocated a more gradual pace of introducing free
market reforms, while the main opposition parties called for a
swift dismantling of the Communist system.
   Ratiu and Campeanu, both exiles who returned from long years
abroad only after the revolution, were vulnerable to charges that
they were not in Romania during the harshest Ceausescu years.
   Voters had 88 parties to choose from, and slow-moving lines of
200 or more people snaked outside polling places. The original
closing time of 11 p.m. was extended when it became clear the
voting was much slower than expected.
   Still, voters relished the chance to cast ballots in their first
free election since 1937.
   In Timisoara, the cradle of the December revolution Vancea
Aurel, 78, a retired civil engineer, was elated as he waited to
cast his ballot for the National Liberal Party.
   ``Until December, I was convinced that neither I nor my children
would ever take part in free elections,'' said Aurel, who voted in
the 1937 elections.
   Up to 3,000 anti-Communist demonstrators gathered in Bucharest's
University Square, where a round-the-clock protest has gone on for
weeks to demand the ouster of Iliescu and other former Communists
from the government.
   ``We hoped (Iliescu) would have a greater opposition,'' said Dan
Trandafirescu, a 33-year-old engineer.
   Opposition parties have called Iliescu a ``neo-Communist'' who
would merely continue the old system under a new name. Iliescu says
he wants to lead the country toward social democracy.
   Although the pre-election campaign occasionally turned violent,
no major incidents were reported Sunday.

   Ted Turner and Jane Fonda stole the show at the
anniversary party for Cable News Network, the Turner brainchild
that turns 10 on June 1.
   The Turner Broadcasting chairman and the actress-aerobics
empress drew crowds wherever they turned during the celebration
Sunday night at CNN Center, headquarters for Turner's media empire.
   But the attention didn't keep them from being openly
affectionate. While a highlight tape of CNN's first 10 years was
shown on a giant monitor, Ms. Fonda wrapped her arms around
Turner's waist and rested her chin on his shoulder and he caressed
her hand.
   ``I have to kind of pinch myself to realize it's gone by so
quickly,'' Turner said in brief remarks about CNN's first decade.
``The next 10 won't be quite as exciting as the first 10, but stay
tuned.''
   The party, which drew about 3,000 guests, was timed to coincide
with the opening of the National Cable Television Association's
annual convention, next door at the Georgia World Congress Center.
   Among other celebrities attending were Maureen Reagan, talk show
host Larry King, CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw and U.S. Rep. Edward
Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House
telecommunications subcommittee.

<HEAD>Court Rules Money Given Mormon Missionaries Not Deductible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monies given directly to Mormon missionaries
by the church's members are not deductible donations under federal
tax law, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
   The court said Congress did not intend to make such direct
contributions tax-deductible.
   Ruling against an Idaho couple who were denied the tax
deductions for subsidizing their two sons' missionary service, the
justices resolved conflicting federal appeals court rulings that
allowed such tax deductions in six states and banned them in nine
states.
   Writing for the court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that
under federal tax law ``a taxpayer may claim a deduction for a
charitable contribution only if the contribution is made to or for
the use of a qualified organization.''
   Giving money directly to a church missionary is ``not a
contribution to or for the use of the church'' under federal tax
law, O'Connor said.
   She said such contributions could qualify as tax-deductible if
held in ``a legally enforceable trust for the qualified
organization or in a similar legal arrangement.''
   The decision is a defeat for Harold and Enid Davis of Idaho
Falls.
   They had been represented before the high court by Rex Lee,
former U.S. solicitor general and now president of Brigham Young
University.
   The couple spent about $7,600 subsidizing their son Benjamin's
missionary work in New York City in 1980-81, and about $1,500 for
their son Cecil's missionary work in New Zealand in 1981.
   Money was deposited into each son's bank account, and the
subsidies for neither son exceeded amounts set by the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   The Davises made the deduction claims belatedly, unsuccessfully
seeking refunds of $1,779.71 and $2,613.10, respectively, for the
two years.
   The Bush administration, although contending that lower court
rulings against the Davises should be upheld, had urged the
justices to review the case.
   Government lawyers noted that 36,000 Mormon missionaries
currently are serving the church.
   The case is Davis vs. U.S., 89-98.

   Pro-Moscow forces in Estonia stopped work today at
several factories to protest the republic's independence drive, but
the strikes were not widespread, spokesmen said.
   ``There are no obvious strikes going on currently in Tallinn,''
Estonian government spokesman Juhan Hindov said from the capital.
   But Artur Kopytyn, a spokesman for the Russian Strike Committee
in Tallinn, said 15 large plants were fully on strike, and limited
work stoppages were reported at dozens of others.
   Journalist Tarmu Tammerk disputed those figures, however. He
said that at an electrical and technological facility Kopytyn said
was on strike the employees voted to continue working.
   ``These plants are not vital for everyday life,'' said Tammerk,
editor of the weekly Estonian Independent. ``They are not
integrated into the Estonian economy. They could be on strike every
day with no effect.''
   The work stoppage made no visible impact on Tallinn, he said.
   Hindov said pressure for the strikes was coming from pro-Moscow
administrators at the factories and from the Russian Strike
Committee, ``but people do not want to strike.''
   Sixty-five percent of the republic's 1.8 million population is
Estonian. Russians comprise 28 percent, with Ukrainians and
Byelorussians making up the rest.
   In the breakaway republic of Lithuania, lawmakers who rejected
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call to suspend their March 11 declaration
of independence met in committees today to consider a counteroffer,
a spokesman for the legislature said.
   The pro-Moscow forces in Estonia and Latvia have stepped up
their activities in the week since Gorbachev branded the secession
campaigns in those republics unconstitutional.
   On Sunday in the Latvian capital of Riga, 1,193 pro-Moscow
delegates representing cities and rural areas gathered to form the
Committee for the Defense of the Constitution and the Rights of
Citizens of the U.S.S.R., the Tass news agency reported.
   The group _ mostly Russians and other ethnic minorities in the
republic _ said the Latvian parliament did not have the legal
authority to declare independence earlier this month, Tass said.
   It also criticized leaders of the pro-independence People's
Front as not living up to their words concerning the equality of
all people. Russians and other minorities in all three Baltic
republics complain that they are discriminated against as a result
of the independence movements.
   ``We have been brought together by our common concern about the
fate of Soviet power in Latvia,'' said Alfred Rubiks, first
secretary of the Communist Party in the republic. He said the
pro-Moscow Communist Party would ``step up its activity'' in the
coming days.
   According to Tass, the committee's aims include ensuring the
operation of the Soviet constitution and the laws of the U.S.S.R.
and Latvia, to ensure social and legal protection of residents, and
to consolidate social and political forces ``recognizing the
people's socialist choice and intending to renew socialism and the
Soviet federation.''
   Gorbachev imposed an economic embargo on Lithuania following its
declaration of independence, and on May 14 he decreed that Latvia's
and Estonia's steps toward independence violated the constitution.
He has not taken any punitive actions against those two republics.
   Last Tuesday, pro-Moscow forces in Latvia and Estonia tried to
enter the parliament buildings of both republics, but they were
turned back by police and pro-independence crowds.
   Gorbachev's embargo on Lithuania, in effect for more than a
month, has cut off all supplies of oil to the republic and nearly
all supplies of natural gas, and has reduced supplies of other key
raw materials. Thousands of people have been laid off as a result.
   Over the weekend, Lithuanian lawmakers agreed to reject
Gorbachev's demand that they suspend their declaration of
independence because it would mean accepting Soviet control over
Lithuania, said legislator Zigmas Vaisvilas.
   Parliament ordered a committee to work out other compromise
proposals to offer Moscow, he said. Lawmakers were following the
advice of Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, who met
with Gorbachev Thursday night in Moscow.
   The Soviet president's meeting with Mrs. Prunskiene ended a
two-month refusal to talk with the Lithuanians, and came after the
republic offered to suspend laws implementing independence in
exchange for negotiations.
   In meeting Mrs. Prunskiene, Gorbachev may have been influenced
by the fact that she planned to meet the following day with U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Baker was in Moscow setting
the agenda for the superpower summit at the end of May.
   ``It's very clear Gorbachev wanted to show President Bush before
the summit that he has started negotiations, and he is not
demanding the same things as in the beginning,'' Vailvilas said.

   Scores of police armed with
semiautomatic weapons and shotguns patrolled the township of
Thabong today after police fired on black protesters, killing seven
and injuring about 40.
   Groups of black protesters angry over the deaths Sunday and
Monday roamed the township outside Welkom in Orange Free State
armed with knives, axes and rocks, witnesses said.
   They said protesters used burned-out vehicles, trees and burning
tires to set up barricades across some streets, and at least one
police vehicle was set ablaze, according to the witnesses.
   Welkom, a gold mining center, has been the scene of repeated
clashes between whites and blacks. Two whites were killed last week
in a clash with blacks.
   ``It's very tense. Buildings have been burned out and it's not
safe to move,'' said one journalist, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Army troops called in to help police Sunday night were not in
sight Monday, witnesses said.
   Police said Monday that officers opened fire on a protest by
blacks returning from a rally. Four people were killed and about 40
people hurt, they said.
   The superintendent of Welkom hospital, Dr. Flip Nel, said three
more people died Monday.
   A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that police
were forced to fire because the blacks had attacked police and
buildings and were trying to march to the white town of Welkom.
   A white man was stabbed and beaten by blacks Sunday night when
he arrived in Welkom on a bus used mostly by blacks, the
independent South African Press Association reported.
   Police said Monday that three people had been killed in separate
incidents in other parts of the country in the previous 24 hours.
The dead included a black man killed in Natal Province when police
opened fire on protesters who stoned a police vehicle, police said.
   In Welkom, right-wing whites have formed ``white defense
groups'' and carry out armed patrols in the town. Blacks have
retaliated with a boycott of white shops and businesses that has
harmed the local economy.
   The government has made repeated efforts to try to ease the
rising racial tension in the town. Whites are angry and fearful
about government plans to end white-minority rule and share power
with blacks.
   Top government officials held talks in Welkom last week to try
to ease the situation. Police and army reinforcements have been
rushed to the town to help maintain order, but clashes have
continued.
   White and black leaders trying to end apartheid fear violent
confrontations could derail political negotiations. The government
and black groups have appealed to people to avoid violence.

attacked its occupants, wounding nine French tourists and a
Jordanian, officials said.
   Amman police chief Fadel Ali said one of the French victims was
seriously wounded and the rest only slightly. However, French
Ambassador Dennis Bouchard said two of the French tourists were in
critical condition. He cited reports from embassy officials at
Amman hospitals.
   Two of the wounded were stabbed, and the rest were shot,
officials said.
   Police immediately arrested the Palestinian and identified him
as Ahmad Badwan, 28, a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip who carries
a temporary Jordanian passport and lives in Amman.
   A witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he heard in
a police report that Badwan reported he acted to avenge the killing
of seven Palestinians by an Israeli near Tel Aviv on Sunday.
   Police did not immediately confirm the witness' report .
   The incident occurred near the Roman amphitheater in downtown
Amman, a popular tourist site.
   The man boarded the bus with 30 tourists aboard near the Roman
amphitheater in downtown Amman and ``threatened to shoot if anybody
moved,'' a police official said.
   ``The tourists were scared and many started shouting, which
pushed the gunman to fire in all directions from a 7mm pistol,''
the official said.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said Badwan fired until he ran
out of ammunition, then continued his attack with a dagger before
surrendering to police.
   Hundreds of bystanders crowded around the tourist bus after the
incident, which took place on a downtown street close to the
amphitheater.
   Ali said French President Francois Mitterrand called Bashir
Hospital to inquire about the condition of the injured. He said
King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan rushed to the hospital to see
the victims.
   Fakri Hussein, manager of the Royal Tours Agency which handled
the French group, said the tourists arrived in Jordan Friday for a
weeklong visit.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Law Requiring Payments to Help Crime Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld a law requiring
people convicted of federal crimes to pay money into a fund to help
crime victims.
   The court unanimously rejected arguments that the law is
unconstitutional because it originated in the Senate, and not in
the House of Representatives.
   The Constitution states that all revenue-raising bills ``shall
originate in the House of Representatives.'' But the court, relying
on an 1897 decision, today said the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 is
not a revenue-raising measure.
   The law is aimed at generating money to offset the costs of
helping crime victims by imposing ``special assessments'' against
convicted criminals.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall invoked the 1897 decision in stating:
``A statute that creates a particular governmental program and that
raises revenue to suppport that program, as opposed to a statute
that raises revenue to support government generally, is not `a bill
for raising revenue' within the meaning of the (Constitution's)
origination clause.''
   The case stemmed from a $50 assessment against a man named
German Munoz-Flores, who was convicted of helping an illegal alien
evade inspection by immigration officials in San Diego County,
Calif., five years ago.
   Munoz-Flores was placed on probation for two years.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the assessment,
agreeing with arguments that the law was a revenue-raising measure
enacted improperly by Congress.
   Today's decision reversed the 9th Circuit court's ruling.
   The ruling is a victory for the Bush administration even though
the justices rejected its argument that the case presented a
``political question'' federal courts should avoid.
   ``The government may be right that a judicial finding that
Congress has passed an unconstitutional law might in some sense be
said to entail a lack of respect for Congress' judgment,'' Marshall
said.
   ``But disrespect, in the sense the government uses the term,
cannot be sufficient to create a political question,'' he said.
``If it were, every judicial resolution of a constitutional
challenge to a congressional enactment would be impermissible.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Munoz-Flores, 88-1932.

   President Bush is vowing to keep pushing
for agreement with Moscow on a treaty to reduce conventional forces
in Europe, while hailing dramatic progress in other arms talks.
   ``In the arms control area, there's been some progress. There
still remain some other problems,'' Bush said after breakthroughs
were announced over the weekend in negotiations to limit chemical
weapons and long-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush said that, despite the current impasse on cutting troops
and tanks in Europe, he still hopes that a 35-nation treaty setting
reduced conventional force levels throughout Europe can be signed
by year's end.
   The president today was completing a four-day speaking tour with
Republican fund-raising appearances in Portland and in Los Angeles.
   At today's Republican fund-raiser for Oregon Attorney General
David Frohnmayer, called for a balancing economic concerns with
environmental priorities.
   His remarks did not appear likely to win praise from
environmentalists, who have been battling timber interests here
over the status of the Spotted Owl.
   His administration must decide by June 23 whether to designate
the owl as an endangered species. To do so would close off vast
tracts of Oregon forest to lumbering activities.
   ``Common sense tells us to find a needed balance,'' Bush said.
``I reject those who would ignore the economic consequences of the
Spotted Owl decision.''
   ``The jobs of many thousands of Oregonians and whole communities
are at stake,'' he said.
   About 150 to 200 people demonstrated outside the hotel where
Bush spoke, burning American flags and newspapers and setting off
smoke bombs. Several were arrested.
   He flew to Portland on Sunday afternoon to speak at a ceremony
dedicating a planned memorial to slain police officers.
   Speaking with reporters on Air Force One, Bush said he was
pleased with the outcome of Secretary of State James A. Baker III's
four-day negotiating session in Moscow.
   Baker brought home an agreement to end chemical weapons
production and reported major progress on a long-sought treaty to
limit strategic nuclear weapons. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev are expected to act on both measures at their May 31-June
3 summit in Washington.
   ``I'm satisfied with the progress made in Moscow that we'll have
a good summit,'' Bush said.
   However, he tempered his remarks by noting a lack of progress on
an agreement to reduce troops, tanks and other non-nuclear arms in
Europe.
   ``We've got to get that done,'' Bush said of the conventional
force reduction treaty. ``Until it's totally finished we've got to
stay in close consultation'' with the Soviets.
   ``This is important not only to us but to all of Europe,'' he
said.
   Bush had predicted a year ago that the agreement would take six
months to a year to complete. The stalemate raised the likelihood
that an agreement would not be ready to be signed, even in a
preliminary form, at the upcoming superpower summit.
   Asked if a conventional arms limitation treaty is still possible
this year, Bush said, ``Oh sure, sure.''
   The Soviets apparently are reluctant to scale back their forces
in Central Europe to 195,000 unless the German army is sharply
reduced as well. Impending prospects of a reunified Germany
apparently are increasing Soviet resistance to the troop cutback.
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters earlier
that the Soviets ``are now stonewalling'' on a conventional arms
treaty.
   Bush said he had talked to Baker on Sunday and that the
secretary of state was ``generally upbeat'' although he added,
``Obviously there are some things we still have to work out.''
   The president said other U.S.-Soviet differences were sure to be
aired at the summit _ including long-festering disputes over Cuba
and Afghanistan.
   Bush also cited differences over German unification. ``Nobody
thought it would be easy. So we're just plugging away on a wide
array of agenda items,'' he said.
   Bush declined to clarify conflicting reports about what Baker
told Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene while in
Moscow. U.S. officials with Baker denied statements by some sources
that he had urged the Lithuanians to suspend their declaration of
independence from the Soviet Union.
   Bush used his speech at the Portland Police Memorial ceremony on
Sunday to accuse the Democratic-led Congress of watering down his
proposed anti-crime package. The legislation is scheduled for
debate in the Senate this week.
   ``For the past year, it's gathered dust in the House and spawned
weak imitations in the Senate,'' Bush said. ``This country deserves
better.''
   His bill calls for expanded use of the death penalty and relaxed
rules on what police can do in gathering evidence. The Senate
version includes a proposed ban on the manufacture of
semi-automatic assault rifles, which the administration opposes.
   Bush also joined the debate over the northern spotted owl,
saying the jobs of timber-related workers must be considered before
forests are cordoned off to protect the owl.
   ``There's a lot of people who's livelihood is threatened out
here. ... We've got to be concerned about the human equation as
well as the environmental equation,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>States May Impose Requirements on Liquor Sold at Military Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States may impose labeling and reporting
requirements on liquor sold at U.S. military bases within their
borders, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court said North Dakota's regulation of liquor sold at two
military bases there does not violate a clause of the Constitution
which generally gives federal policy priority over state
regulations.
   North Dakota requires that all liquor sold in the state be
distributed through a state-controlled system.
   The state said out-of-state liquor distributors must put a label
on each bottle sold at the Grand Forks and Minot Air Force Bases
stating that the liquor is for consumption only at the military
installations.
   The state also said suppliers must report monthly on how much
liquor they shipped into the state.
   The high court upheld the labeling regulation by a 5-4 vote and
the reporting rule, 9-0.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in the court's main opinion, said
both regulations are valid under the 21st Amendment to the
Constitution which repealed Prohibition and gave states sweeping
power over liquor distribution.
   Stevens said the rules serve the state's legitimate interest in
preventing diversion of liquor from military bases into the
civilian market.
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justice Antonin Scalia voted to uphold both regulations, but for
different reasons he expressed in a separate concurring opinion.
   Voting to uphold North Dakota's reporting regulation but strike
down the labeling requirement were Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Federal officials challenged North Dakota's liquor regulation
system on grounds it violates a federal policy aimed at assuring
liquor sold at clubs and stores on military bases would be purchaed
by the government at the lowest possible price. Profits from the
military base sales are used to pay for recreational activities.
   Federal officials said it could cost the government $200,000 to
$250,000 more each year if they are forced to abide by North
Dakota's rules.
   They said the regulations will force them to purchase more
liquor from North Dakota distributors at higher prices.
   Today's ruling overturns a 1988 decision by the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   The National Beer Wholesalers' Association supported North
Dakota's appeal, saying the state has good reason to be concerned
about diversion of liquor from military bases.
   The case is North Dakota vs. U.S., 88-926.

   A science teacher was preparing to
blow up the school when the assistant principal discovered him, so
he shot the administrator to death, according to a published report
today.
   Teacher Donald Givens is charged with fatally shooting Assistant
Principal Ron Wallace, then setting fire to the school, authorities
said. Givens was being held without bond today at the county jail.
   The Nashville Banner, quoting unidentified investigators,
reported today that Givens was planning to set off an explosion at
Hickman County High School when Wallace walked in on him Sunday
morning.
   At the time, Givens was turning on propane gas spigots in the
school science department where candles were burning, investigators
told the Banner.
   Superintendent Wayne Qualls said several student complaints had
been lodged against Givens, 50, and the teacher may have feared he
was about to lose his tenured job.
   Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agent Tom Brown declined to
comment on what Givens was doing at the school except to say ``he
was engaged in an activity that he didn't want public.''
   ``He panicked and reacted without thinking and set the fire to
cover it up,'' Brown said.
   Wallace had gone to the school Sunday morning to put the
finishing touches on the school's auditorium for the afternoon
baccalaureate service, Principal Rick Brewer said.
   Wallace was shot twice, and the body was discovered in the hall
outside the biology laboratory at the burning building, said police
Officer Howard Choate.
   Candles were used to set fire to the science wing, and fires
were also set in two libraries, Choate said. He said the natural
gas in the biology lab had been turned on, but firefighters shut it
off before it ignited.
   Firefighters put out the blazes 20 minutes after the 9 a.m.
call. Damage, estimated at $150,000, was confined to books and
materials.
   Before his arrest Sunday, Givens had come to the school and
acted like one of the bereaved faculty, sitting at a desk and
drinking coffee, Fire Chief Kenneth Thompson said. He would not say
what led authorities to Givens.
   Wallace also was athletic director at the school in this town of
2,800 people 40 miles southwest of Nashville. His daughter, April
is the class president for this year's graduating seniors at the
850-student school.
   Classes were canceled today.
   ``It's a devastating and shocking situation,'' said English
teacher Linda Richardson. ``It's really frightening. This is
something that you just don't expect to happen. This community is
really close knit.''
   Wallace had been named assistant principal last fall and was set
to complete his certification for principal in July, Ms. Richardson
said.

   Security forces fired today on a crowd of
100,000 Moslems carrying the body of a slain Kashmir religious
leader, and at least 30 people were killed and 200 injured,
witnesses and doctors said.
   State government officials in Srinagar could not be reached for
comment, but an official source in New Delhi gave a different
version of the shooting.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said militants
opened fire on paramilitary troops ``and in the cross-fire
approximately 20 people were killed and 40 were wounded.''
   Witnesses and doctors in Srinagar said 30 bodies and at least
200 people with bullet wounds were brought to Soura hospital. Many
of the injured said 40 more bodies still lay on the streets in the
Srinagar neighborhood where the firing occurred.
   The city was under curfew and further details were not available
immediately.
   For five months soldiers and other security forces have been
deployed in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, in a bid to control a
violent campaign by Islamic militants who want the predominantly
Moslem state to secede from mostly Hindu India.

   Two championship caliber golf courses in
Scottsdale, Ariz., produce revenues for the city, local business
and the professional golf tour _ leaving only the landowner without
a dime.
   The landlord is the federal government.
   The Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation had the option
of investing money to help turn a desert into golf courses _ and
cutting itself in on subsequent revenues.
   The bureau chose not to invest, instead simply leasing the land
free to the city.
   Scottsdale then built the courses and hired a subsidiary of the
profit-making PGA Tour to run them. The city gets a percentage of
the course fees and sales. The PGA makes a profit. The U.S.
government, which has the land as a flood control project, gets
nothing.
   The deal doesn't look like a hole in one to Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., whose House Government Operations environment subcommittee
is investigating the arrangement and plans to hold a hearing this
summer.
   ``It begs the question of whether they had any common sense and
whether they had any vision,'' Synar said of the federal lease
negotiators. ``If people in the private sector did these kind of
deals, they'd be fired.''
   Bureau of Reclamation officials said their purpose was to turn
the area into a public recreation project and avoid maintenance
costs.
   ``If we had to do it again, we would look at the revenue issue a
lot more in depth,'' said Bob Michaels, a bureau recreational
resource specialist in Phoenix who helped negotiate the lease.
   City officials had a similar purpose in avoiding maintenance
costs, but still arranged to benefit from course revenues. And
their vision didn't stop with the golf courses.
   Scottsdale allowed a resort, the Princess, to be built next door
on non-federal land. The city's room tax on the resort brings in
additional revenue. The Princess also generates business for the
courses _ 17 percent of the tee times are reserved for its guests.
   Of the two courses, the Stadium Course is site of the Phoenix
Open each January, and everyday players pay $75 in fees to use the
facility during the peak winter season. The adjoining Desert Course
charges $16 in the winter to allow use by players of average
financial means.
   The courses are on 180 acres within the Paradise Valley Flood
Detention Basin of the Central Arizona Project, a canal that brings
Colorado River water to about 60 communities. The property is a
vital holding basin to protect the canal in case of a flood.
   Bureau of Reclamation officials note that they made the land
available for recreation, avoided $300,000 in annual maintenance
costs and still preserved the acreage for flood protection.
   The bureau gave Scottsdale, which adjoins Phoenix, a free
50-year lease in June 1985.
   Carder Hunt, assistant to Scottsdale's city manager, said the
city spent $18 million _ $13 million from bond issues _ to develop
the courses, which opened in 1987.
   The Bureau of Reclamation is allowed to invest up to 50 percent
of the cost of adapting water project land for recreational use.
The bureau can then cut itself into any revenue arrangement from
the recreation facility.
   ``At that time, the issue of revenue generating capacity never
came up to the degree it does today,'' said Michaels, the bureau's
lease negotiator.
   ``We didn't know the resort would come in, and that the Phoenix
Open would come in there. At the time, we knew the thing could
probably carry itself, but we didn't go into an economic
analysis,'' he said. ``I guess we didn't go quite far enough. We
didn't examine the issue of large revenues.''
   Judy Weiss, special projects manager in Scottsdale's Community
Services Department, said city officials made it clear during
negotiations that it needed a package deal that would include two
high-caliber golf courses and a resort.
   Reclamation Bureau spokesman Bob Walsh in Phoenix said the
agency saves its investments for projects that ``draw from a
diverse and large geographical area.''
   The golf courses, he said, ``will get some out-of-state traffic,
but by and large it will be from the local community.''
   But Bill Reid, the general manager of the courses, estimated
half of the more than 130,000 golfers at the facilities each year
are from out of town.
   Hunt said the Phoenix Open drew 350,000 spectators in January,
pumping an estimated $13 million into the Phoenix-Scottsdale
economy. Scottsdale expects that combined revenues it receives from
the courses and the resort will exceed the city's annual bond debt
beginning in 1992.
   The city's cut of sales and fees at the courses generated
$485,000 in 1989. Scottsdale only retained $100,000, however. The
rest went to the Tournament Players Club, under a temporary
arrangement to repay the club for money loaned during construction.

   A magazine Monday berated the British for their
dress and manners, saying European neighbors regard them as the
slobs of the continent.
   ``We go out without combing our hair, wear the same shoes two
days running and throw rubbish out of our car windows,'' complained
``She,'' a monthly women's magazine.
   It said other Europeans consider British men ill-mannered and
chided British women for dressing badly and shouting at their
children in public.
   If the British want to join the ``nouveau European'' elite, the
magazine said, their manners, attitudes, habits and appearance all
need ``a complete overhaul.''
   Tips offered by the magazine include never leaving home unless
groomed immaculately, remembering to wish everyone good morning,
afternoon or evening, and walking with ``dignity and grace.''
   Other guidelines: spending more on personal appearance,
displaying family loyalty, drinking more mineral water and never
eating junk food in the street.

<TEXT>
   Seismographs recorded strong aftershocks to
a major earthquake that shook a refugee-filled area of Sudan, but
there were no reports Monday of significant damage or injuries.
   The aftershocks in southern Sudan followed Sunday morning's
quake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. A quake of that
magnitude is capable of causing widespread destruction.
   The earthquake zone is about 700 miles south of Khartoum,
Sudan's capital, an area of sprawling wetlands and trackless jungle.
   The shock was felt in towns controlled by the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army and in government-held areas.
   Juba, the south's largest urban area, is 60 miles southwest of
the epicenter. It is full of people displaced by the war and living
mainly off supplies from international relief agencies.
   Damage was said to be negligible in government-controlled Juba,
a collection of low-slung British colonial style mortar buildings
and refugee shanties. Because of refugees, its population is
roughly double the normal 125,000.
   Relief workers reported no damage from rebel areas, mostly rural
settlements with few substantial buildings.
   Egyptian geologist Rashad M. Kebeasy said two of the aftershocks
measured about 5 on the Richter scale.
   Kebeasy, president of Egypt's National Research Institute of
Astronomy and Geophysics, said Sunday's quake would have probably
been a disaster in a populated area.
   ``I'm sure that if somebody went into the jungle, he would find
big faults, cracks in the earth,'' said Kebeasy, an expert on
northeastern Africa's earthquake patterns.
   ``But this area is very unpopulated. There's nothing there to
bring down.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Gets Pay Increase, Tass Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's popularity may
not be soaring at home, but the official Tass news agency said
Monday he is in line for a hefty pay raise.
   Tass said the Soviet legislature had set Gorbachev's monthly pay
at 4,000 rubles _ $6,480 _ more than twice what he is currently
reported to be earning.
   The news agency also said lawmakers decided to make presidential
perks part of the public record, replacing traditional ``secret
instructions'' regarding their leaders' compensation.
   They formalized the fact that Gorbachev is entitled to the use
of specially equipped cars, planes and helicopters and to official
residences in the capital and the Crimea, a Black Sea resort area.
   A magazine editor last year disclosed that the Soviet leader's
monthly salary was 1,500 rubles _ $2,430 _ about seven times the
pay of a typical Soviet worker.
   After taxes, his new monthly income will be 2,300 rubles, or
$3,726, Tass said. The news agency did not report details of any
debate on Gorbachev's salary and benefits.
   The pay raise comes at a time of increasing public discontent
over Gorbachev's domestic policies, particularly economic reforms
that have left store shelves bare and millions of Soviets with
insufficient housing.

<HEAD>Prison Population Grows 12 Percent in One Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of inmates in state and federal
prisons grew a record 12 percent last year to 703,687 prisoners,
according to a Justice Department study.
   The inmate population increased 76,099 last year from a 1988
prison population of 627,588 held in state and federal facilities,
said the study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics released Sunday.
   The nation's prison population has more than doubled in the last
decade, from 373,866 inmates in 1980 to 703,687 last year, said the
study.
   The increase in the number of prisoners outstripped the number
of new cells being built by state and federal prison systems, the
study said.
   The study estimated that the capacity of the nation's prisons
increased by 40,000 to 60,000 beds last year and prisons were
overcrowded by 10 percent to 29 percent.
   Overcrowding in facilities operated by 19 states and the
District of Colombia forced authorities to house 18,236 prisoners
in local jails or other facilities, the study said.
   Only three states _ Kansas, North Dakota and Alaska _ reported
decreases in prison populations last year. The biggest proportional
increase occurred in Rhode Island, where the number of inmates
jumped 30.1 percent, followed by Colorado, with a 26.9 percent
increase.
   South Dakota had the third highest percentage increase _ 25.2
percent _ and Utah ranked fourth with a 21.3 percent jump.

<TEXT>
   A laboratory run by Nobel Prize-winning scientists
at a medical school was damaged when a fire broke out, releasing
hazardous material and forcing an evacuation from the building.
   Dallas fire Chief Mike Zak said 12 firefighters and eight people
who were building employees or security officials were taken to
Parkland Memorial Hospital for observation but were later released.
   Investigators today were trying to determine how Sunday night's
fire started in one of several labs run by Michael S. Brown and
Joseph L. Goldstein at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center.
   Initial reports that radioactive substances had been released at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center turned out to
be wrong, Zak saud. Such materials are used at the lab.
   College spokeswoman spokeswoman Tommy Bosler said about a cup of
hydrazine burned, but that the floor has been reopened. The
hydrazine posed no threat, she said.
   Hydrazine, a flammable, corrosive material, is poisonous and may
be fatal if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through the skin. The
compound burns the eyes and skin on contact and its vapors may
cause flash fires and explode.
   The fire began in a ventilator hood, used to store chemicals
that could be hazardous if spilled or inhaled, Ms. Bosler said.
   ``The official results aren't in but the general consensus is
there was an electrical short in this ventilator hood,'' Ms. Bosler
said.
   Brown and Goldstein won the 1985 Nobel Prize in medicine for
discoveries related to cholesterol metabolism and
cholesterol-related diseases.
   The two-alarm blaze on the building's fifth floor forced the
evacuation of several people, Zak said. Authorities also diverted
traffic around the medical center.

<HEAD>Police Try To Seize Body of Dead Student Activist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By J.H. YUN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police firing tear gas stormed a
hospital ground Monday to try to seize the body of a dead student
activist but fled after students fought back with metal pipes and
rocks, students and witnesses said.
   About 100 combat-clad riot police charged into an outdoor area
at Chonnam University Hospital. About 500 students armed with
firebombs and metal pipes were guarding the body of 21-year-old
activist Shin Jang-ho, which was inside the hospital morgue.
   The student suffered fatal head injuries Saturday when he jumped
from a train to try to avoid police checkpoints. Students blamed
police for the death.
   Students had set up a funeral altar with burning incense in the
courtyard, which they said was not disturbed in the clash. There
were no reports of arrests or injuries.
   About 1,000 riot police remained at entrances to the hospital,
checking identities of those who entered. More police watched from
across a major road outside the hospital's main entrance.
   There was no official explanation for the police action. In the
past, police have tried to seize bodies of dead activists to return
them to their families and to deprive radicals of a symbol to
continue anti-government protests.
   Government officials in Kwangju called Monday for a halt to
violent protests that have rocked this southern provincial city for
three days. Radicals vowed more demonstrations.
   Radical student leaders called for a huge street rally Tuesday
``to oppose the U.S., which manipulated from behind the Kwangju
massacre.''
   Thousands of radical students and dissidents gathered in Kwangju
last week for Friday's 10th anniversary of the Kwangju civil
uprising against the government. They have staged violent
anti-government and anti-U.S. protests for three days.
   Protesters claim U.S. military officials condoned the military
crackdown on the 1980 uprising, in which officials say 200 people
died. Dissidents say the death toll was much higher.
   The United States has denied any role in the Kwangju action.
   On Sunday, more than 200 students and citizens and 84 police
were injured in a six-hour rampage in downtown Kwangju after police
blocked 10,000 protesters trying to march to the provincial
government headquarters.
   Radical student leader Lee Ki-hon told a news conference Monday
the police should be held accountable for the death Saturday of
Shin.
   Radicals said Shin would be buried as a martyr Wednesday after
funeral services at Chonnam University. In the past, the deaths of
protesters have triggered huge demonstrations.
   Kwangju Mayor Choi In-kee said the protests against the
government of President Roh Tae-woo and the presence of U.S. troops
in Korea had been instigated by outsiders.
   ``Violence will no longer be tolerated,'' he said in a
statement. Other officials also urged an end to the demonstrations.
   In the central city of Taegu, about 80 students shouting
anti-government slogans attacked a police substation with firebombs
and rocks, the national news agency Yonhap reported.
   Yonhap said the students had left a rally at Kyunbuk National
University commemorating the Kwangju anniversary.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney met Monday
with a West German official before leaving for a NATO meeting in
Brussels.
   The Pentagon said the brief meeting between Cheney and Walter
Wallmann, minister president of the West German state of Hesse, was
a courtesy visit.
   Wallmann's office said the session was the beginning of a round
of meetings dealing with possible reductions in U.S. military
strength in Germany.
   Wallmann's position as minister president of Hesse is similar to
that of governor of an American state. Hesse includes a number of
U.S. military installations, including V Corps headquarters at
Frankfurt and large concentrations at the famous Fulda Gap leading
into East Germany.
   Wallmann planned to discuss the social effects of possible U.S.
troop withdrawal, what happens to German civilians working for the
U.S. military and the future of Wiesbaden-Erbenheim Army airfield,
his office said.
   The United States wants more combat helicopters and other Army
aircraft stationed at the field, but is meeting opposition from
local residents complaining of aircraft noise.
   Frankfurt officials have suggested turning Erbenheim into a
civilian expansion of Rhein-Main Airport, which is shared by
civilian airliners and the U.S. military.
   Cheney was leaving Monday for a two-day meeting of the NATO
Defense Planning Committee in Brussels, Belgium.
   Wallmann also was to meet with National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft. On Tuesday, aides said, he is scheduled to meet with
Lawrence S. Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About one in every four Iowans owns a
pair of bib overalls, which apparently are a hot fashion item among
some younger people.
   Honest.
   This news comes from the wacky folks at the Iowa Poll, who
previously have revealed how many Iowans own lawn ornaments (24
percent), believe there is life on other planets (43 percent) and
believe that it's not the heat, it's the humidity (87 percent).
   The latest finding, published in The Des Moines Register on
Sunday, is that 28 percent of adult Iowans own a pair of bib
overalls. Furthermore, the denim outfits are favored about equally
by young women, male Baby Boomers and farmers.
   Forty percent of the women aged 18 to 24 own a pair, but only 20
percent of the men in that age group. That figure increases to 39
percent for men 25-44, the survey found.
   Forty-one percent of the state's male farmers wear bib overalls
and 45 percent of the male blue-collar workers own a pair,
according to the poll.
   Bib overalls have been around since 1895, and originally were
worn mostly by men. And that remains true among older Iowans. The
poll found that 37 percent of the Iowa men 65 and older have bib
overalls, but only 11 percent of the women in that group.
   Although popular among young Iowans, bibs aren't about to push
Izod and Ralph Lauren off department store clothing racks. The poll
shows bibs remain more popular in rural areas and small towns than
in large cities. And they are least popular with white-collar
workers and college graduates.
   The poll's figures were based on interviews with 811 Iowans
selected at random. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4
percentage points.

   A series of blasts occurred outside an Osaka
apartment house used by government employees Monday, injuring four
people, and police blamed extremists opposed to the visit of South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo.
   The three explosions broke windows in the apartment building and
in nearby homes, according to police in Osaka, 255 miles west of
Tokyo.
   One of the injured was a firefighter, who officials said was in
serious condition. The other injuries, to apartment dwellers or
area residents, were minor, they said.
   The South Korean president arrives in Japan on Thursday. Radical
groups, including the leftist Chukaku-ha, or Middle Core Faction,
say Roh's visit is a step toward re-establishing the Japanese
empire as it existed before and during World War II.
   Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 to 1945.
   Roh has been under pressure in South Korea to cancel the
three-day visit unless there are more agreements involving the
treatment of the estimated 677,000 Korean nationals living in Japan.
   Last month, Japanese and South Korean government officials
reached agreement on the legal status of third-generation Koreans
in Japan, many of them descendants of Koreans brought by force to
Japan as workers before and during World War II.
   Under the new guidelines, Koreans of the third and succeeding
generations may live in Japan permanently and no longer have to
submit to fingerprinting by authorities.

   A gunman shot two people this
morning and took one of his victims hostage in a church, police
said.
   The man shot the people about 8:45 a.m., said Julie Wolinksi, a
police spokeswoman in Melbourne Beach. He then barricaded himself
inside the Episcopal church, Saint Sebastian-By-The-Sea.
   No one else was believed to be inside the church, she said. But
reporters at the scene heard a man and a woman screaming, leading
them to believe two people were being held hostage.
   The gunman's identity was not immediately known, officials said.
   The other shooting victim was taken to the Holmes Regional
Medical Center, Ms. Wolinski said.
   The victim, Diane Conarroe, was in surgery with two gunshot
wounds to the abdomen, said hospital spokeswoman Valerie Davis. The
43-year-old woman was expected to be in surgery for most of the
afternoon, Davis said.
   Police surrounded the church as a hostage negotiator from the
Brevard County Sheriff's Office tried to talk the gunman into
releasing the hostage and surrendering, she said.
   Homes and schools were being evacuated in this town of 2,600
people, 25 miles south of Cape Canaveral, authorities said.

<HEAD>Government Cuts Prices, Farmers Rally Against Western Competition</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE West German opposition saying
it opposes proposed merger treaty; pickup 8th graf pvs, `The
East...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German shops slashed prices on
everything from televisions to sportswear today in a move to
compete with a flood of Western products.
   The government announced the price cuts just six weeks before
East Germany is to implement a free market and merge its economy
with West Germany, a major step toward uniting the nations.
   Parliament met in East Berlin to debate a proposed treaty that
would merge the economies and social institutions of the German
states by July 2. Hundreds of farmers driving tractors and trucks
left nearby Potsdam for a protest during the legislative session.
   East German farmers want protection from West European food
imports, which are better packaged and often cheaper than East
German goods because of European Economic Community subsidies.
   In the West German capital of Bonn, the main opposition party
rejected the economic merger proposal at it now stands and demanded
better terms for East Germany.
   The position of the Social Democrats could mean trouble for the
treaty since the party has control of the West German parliament's
upper house.
   Party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel said the treaty falls short of
helping create ``modern and qualified jobs'' for East Germans and
guarding against the collapse of East German businesses.
   The treaty was signed Friday by the East German and West German
governments but still must be approved by the nations' parliaments.
The Social Democrats control the West German Bundesrat, and they
could delay approval if their demands are not met.
   Vogel said his party's actions will depend on ``answers to our
demands.''
   In East Berlin, lines of consumers formed outside clothing,
furniture and electronic stores as dramatically reduced prices went
into effect.
   The East German Commerce and Tourism Ministry said the price
cuts would average about 60 percent on a variety of consumer goods,
according to a report by the government news agency ADN.
   Television prices dropped from about $1,818 to about $780. The
moves were aimed at competing with the huge influx of Western
products flooding into East Germany.
   Even though economic union is not scheduled until July 2, the
date which Western businesses can legally begin operating
independently in the country, many foreign firms already have begun
``joint ventures'' with East German interests.
   The joint ventures often amount to little more than using an
East German storefront or hotel room.
   Herman Pflaum, head of the East German government commission on
joint ventures, said 1,145 were in effect in East Germany by late
April, 90 percent of them involving West German firms.
   Western food products also are increasingly appearing on East
German store shelves.
   East Germans began buying Western goods in November, when the
former Communist government was forced to open the borders in the
face of a massive revolt.
   The effect has been a steady increase in joblessness and worker
unrest. Shoe industry workers have staged frequent strikes to
protest what they say is the loss of their market to Western
competitors.
   That industry last week was the first to announce drastic price
cuts to compete.
   Although Eastern goods, especially food, often are cheaper than
Western-made goods, quality is often much poorer.
   Many of East Germany's state factories and enterprises are
expected to shut down when they are forced to compete in a free
market. Hundreds of thousands of workers are expected to lose their
jobs.

   Flash flood worries receded today in Hot Springs, Ark., one day
after a 6-foot wall of water caved in shop windows, carried off
bridges and swept up cars and people.
   Residents had to be rescued from their roofs after their homes
were swamped by nearly 13 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending
Sunday morning. Several people rescued from cars were taken to
hospitals with minor injuries.
   ``A wall of water just came in and everything was just floating
around,'' said Bill Goodwin, who owns a souvenir store in the
resort city. ``Even the fixtures _ they just turned over and
floated.''
   Goodwin said he watched a floating compact car crash through a
window. Jerry Chambliss, who runs an art gallery, said a woman was
washed out of a bathhouse and down a street but grabbed a sign at
the end of the block.
   ``We couldn't get to her and we told her to hang on,'' he said.
``She was hollering and screaming. Then this guy came by in a
front-end loader and just scooped her up.''
   A 90-year-old landmark iron bridge in Malvern on the Ouachita
River was washed away. Eight other bridges in the Hot Springs area
were washed out.
   ``It was like the Colorado rapids,'' Chambliss said. ``I
expected a raft to come by. There were these big waves. I've never
seen anything so frightening in my 42 years.''
   The National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm warnings
overnight for parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas, including Hot
Springs, but flash flood warnings were not posted.
   Early today, southeastern Oklahoma was blasted with 50 mph winds
and hail stones nearly as big as golf balls, but flood levels in
two affected rivers were expected to begin dropping by afternoon,
officials said.
   In Indiana, residents in Petersburg and Boonville suffered the
irony of having no fresh water despite the storms because raging
torrents broke water mains.
   Today, only about 60 homes in the Boonville water system
remained without water, but Petersburg residents faced a water
crisis that could last 10 days, officials said.
   Meanwhile, local authorities in southern Indiana were preparing
for inspections this week by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which will determine whether home and business owners are
eligible for low-interest federal loans.
   Elsewhere, farmers in central Louisiana who erected levees to
hold back the bloated Red River were warned to expect even higher
water next month.
   In the southeastern Texas town of Coldspring, Wayne Pady and his
wife, Debbie, turned their hilltop home into a shelter, feeding and
housing about 20 people forced to flee high water from Lake
Livingston.
   ``I had just purchased a house on top of a hill, so we just had
everyone down there come up here,'' Pady said. The 39-year-old is
disabled by back problems from a 1985 car accident, and his only
income is Social Security.
   ``Everybody helps one another down here,'' said Charlie Bell
Wright, 60, whose husband and daughter were staying with the Padys.
``They try to share what they've got. You don't find many people
like this in other places.''
   Flooding in the region along the Arkansas, Trinity and Red
rivers has caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and
killed 13 people in the past three weeks in Texas, Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Louisiana.
   Floods eased in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois and Indiana. At least
two people died in Illinois and authorities searched for a woman
missing in flooding near Jefferson City, Mo., since Thursday.

   About 3,000 students demonstrated outside
Zaire's embassy Monday and then marched to the Zambian Foreign
Ministry to protest alleged slayings of university students by
security forces in Zaire.
   The placard-waving protesters were escorted by heavily armed
riot police. They brought traffic to a halt, but there were no
reports of violence or arrests.
   The students demanded the ouster of Zaire President Mobutu Sese
Seko and urged Zambia to impose trade sanctions on its northern
neighbor.
   At the Foreign Ministry, they were addressed biefly by Foreign
Minister Luke Mwananshiku. He said the government had not received
confirmation of violence in the southern Zaire town of Lubumbashi.
   The demonstrators say an unspecified number of students were
killed by state guardsmen Friday at the university in Lubumbashi.
   Reports of the alleged killings came from travelers reaching
Zambia's central Copperbelt province, about 60 miles from the
Lubumbashi university, students said.
   There has been no independent confirmation of the reports.
   However, the government-owned Times of Zambia said over the
weekend that up to 150 students may have died in clashes with
guardsmen during a week of protests at the Lubumbashi campus.
   The newspaper quoted a Lubumbashi medical student who fled to
the Copperbelt town of Ndola as saying guardsmen stormed the campus
early Friday.
   The student did not give details of the students' grievances.
   Mobuto promised to end two decades of authoritarian one-party
rule in Zaire recently after widespread protests.
   Newly legalized opposition groups, however, have accused the
pro-Western government of violently suppressing their activities.
   Mobutu's U.S.-backed government has also been accused of
large-scale corruption.

   When actor Robby Benson and his wife,
actress-singer Karla DeVito, left Hollywood two years ago, their
friends thought they were crazy.
   But Benson and DeVito, who now lead a quiet life at the campus
of the University of South Carolina, may have the last laugh. With
no agents, no managers, not much money and little fanfare, Benson
has produced a romantic comedy, ``Modern Love.''
   It's playing in selected cities in the Southeast and will be
more broadly distributed this summer.
   Even if the $1.5 million film is not a box-office smash, Benson
said he and DeVito already are a success.
   ``We've already won because of the way Karla and I feel about
each other and what we accomplished,'' he said in the May 28 issue
of People magazine.
   Benson landed at the university after he struck a deal to teach
film making if he could make a film at the school.
   He wrote the screenplay and produced and directed the movie,
which stars himself, DeVito and their 6-year-old daughter, Lyric.
Benson also enlisted pal Burt Reynolds, who acted for scale wages
of $398 a day.
   ``The problem with Robby is he's almost too good to be true,''
Reynolds said. ``He had a great career and then made some films
that didn't work, and he got blamed. That's Hollywood, it eats
people alive.''

   It's probably no surprise, but Ted Turner and
Jane Fonda were the hottest item at the anniversary party for
Turner's Cable News Network, which turns 10 on June 1.
   The couple turned heads throughout the celebration Sunday night
at CNN Center, headquarters for Turner Broadcasting.
   But the spotlight didn't keep them from being openly
affectionate. While a highlight tape of CNN's first 10 years was
shown on a giant monitor, Ms. Fonda wrapped her arms around
Turner's waist and rested her chin on his shoulder and he caressed
her hand.
   ``I have to kind of pinch myself to realize it's gone by so
quickly,'' Turner said in brief remarks about CNN's first decade.
``The next 10 won't be quite as exciting as the first 10, but stay
tuned.''
   The party, which drew about 3,000 guests, was timed to coincide
with the opening of the National Cable Television Association's
annual convention, next door at the Georgia World Congress Center.
   Among other celebrities attending were Maureen Reagan, talk show
host Larry King, CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw and U.S. Rep. Edward
Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House
telecommunications subcommittee.
   Earlier in the day, Turner was the commencement speaker at
Tougaloo College near Jackson, Miss., where he advised graduates to

   Judith Durham, the original golden
voice of the 1960s folk-rock group The Seekers, was in satisfactory
condition Monday after surgery for injuries sustained in a car
crash.
   A spokesman for Melbourne's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital said
the 47-year-old singer was resting comfortably after lengthy
surgery for compound fractures of the left leg and right wrist.
   Durham was injured Sunday night when the car in which she was
traveling collided head-on with another vehicle northwest of
Melbourne. A woman passenger in the other car was killed.
   The accident occurred the day after Durham and her husband,
pianist Ron Edgeworth, had performed before a packed house at the
National Theater.
   Durham left The Seekers in the late '60s to pursue a solo
career. Her voice had given the group its characteristic sound on
songs such as ``Georgy Girl'' and ``I Will Never Find Another You.''
   The Seekers recently reformed and Durham's place was taken by
Australian singer Julie Anthony.

   Tevin Campbell says he doesn't feel like a
superstar. But the 13-year-old still has plenty of time to acquire
the feeling.
   Music critics liken his soulful voice to that of a young Michael
Jackson, and Tevin has been swarmed by the media since he sang on
Quincy Jones' ``Back on the Block'' album.
   Tevin's fan club has also started to grow because of recent
layouts in teen magazines and television performances on programs
such as ``The Arsenio Hall Show.''
   ``People come up and ask me for my autograph, but I don't feel
like a superstar,'' Tevin told the Dallas Times Herald during a
recent interview at his suburban Dallas home. ``I guess it hasn't
caught up with me yet.''
   His ballad ``Tomorrow'' has been climbing the charts since it
was released last month as a single from Jones' album. But Tevi
still acts like a typical teen-ager _ wearing torn blue jeans,
shopping at the mall and teasing his siblings.
   ``The first time I heard it (on the radio), I didn't believe it
was me,'' he said. ``Now it's getting kind of regular to me.''

   Former tennis star Arthur Ashe told 2,200
graduates of the State University College that dealing with a
culturally diverse world would be their greatest challenge.
   ``You'll have to learn how to get along with the rest of the
world,'' said Ashe, a former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion and
author of a book about black athletes.
   ``Cultural diversity is something you'll have to deal with,
whether you like it or not,'' he said at Sunday's commencement.
``There are now several clusters of power in the world, and there
are no longer advantages to being an American.
   ``Cultural diversity is like a marriage: you have to work at
it.''

<HEAD>Acne Medicine Promising Treatment for Throat Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widely used acne drug Accutane appears to
signficantly block the growth of new tumors in people being treated
for smoking-related cancer of the mouth and throat, according to a
study released Monday.
   Although doctors can often initially remove all signs of this
cancer with surgery and radiation, patients face a high risk of
recurring tumors elsewhere in their throat and lungs.
   The new research suggests that Accutane, an artificial form of
vitamin A, can prevent the development of these second tumors,
perhaps by halting the progression of smoking-related injury to the
body.
   ``This is a very promising lead,'' said Dr. Waun K. Hong. ``It
has the potential to prevent second cancers.''
   Hong, now a physician at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston, began the study in 1983 while at the Veterans
Administration Hospital in Boston. He presented his results at the
annual meeting of the American Society Clinical Oncology.
   ``I think this stuff is great,'' said Dr. Bruce Cheson of the
National Cancer Institute. ``If we can do this (prevent second
cancers), it will be a major service.''
   Cancers of the head, neck, esophagus and lungs account for
almost one-third of the 510,000 cancer deaths expected in the
United States this year.
   In his study, Hong gave Accutane to 49 patients in whom doctors
had removed all outward signs of cancer. Another 51 people took
dummy placebos.
   During three years of follow up, two of the Accutane patients,
or 4 percent, developed second cancers, compared with 12 patients,
or 24 percent, in the comparison group.
   Both of the Accutane patients had a single recurring tumor,
while four of the 12 placebo patients had multiple second cancers.
   Patients took high doses of Accutane, and this turned out to be
a drawback, because many suffered unpleasant side effects. These
included dry skin, chapped lips and eye inflammation. The problems
were so severe that 14 of the patients did not finished the
year-long course of treatment.
   ``Some people said, `Doc, I just can't take it. My face is so
red that people think I'm drinking,''' Hong said.
   Because of the side effects, Hong said he does not recommend the
drug for routine use in these cancer patients. He said new studies
will be necessary to see if lower doses will cause fewer problems
yet still prevent recurring cancers.
   Accutane, known technically as 13-cis retinoic acid, can also
cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy.
   Dr. Roger Foster of the University of Vermont said that despite
the drawbacks, ``the interesting thing is that there has been a
demonstration of a preventative agent.''
   Dr. Edith Mitchell of the University of Missouri in Columbia
added, ``It's a big deal, but we need to find the minimal dose that
patients can tolerate.''
   Hong also cautioned that although the drug appears to prevent
the development of second tumors, it does not stop the cancer from
coming back in the site where it was initially treated. The study
was too small to determine whether it helped patients live longer.
   Hong theorized that it works by suppressing pre-cancerous
abnormalities in the body's air passageways.
   He said this approach also raises the possibility that drugs may
someday be able to prevent a first cancer in people who are at high
risk because of a lifetime of exposure to tobacco smoke. But even
if this can be done, it should not be an excuse to keep smoking.
   ``It would be very dangerous for smokers to think they can take
a pill instead of giving up smoking,'' he said.
   Hong said he hopes to study less toxic forms of vitamin A, which
may be more tolerable for long-term use.

<HEAD>ABC's Fall Schedule Renews ``Twin Peaks,'' Despite Ratings Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ABC unveiled its fall schedule today and renewed
David Lynch's surreal, quirky ``Twin Peaks,'' even though the
series has slid sharply in the ratings and had its lowest Nielsens
to date on Thursday.
   NBC planned to announce its fall schedule later today.
   While renewing one of the season's most written-about new
series, ABC dropped six other midseason replacements, including
``Elvis'' and Oprah Winfrey's ``Brewster Place.'' All had low
ratings. The other casualties: ``Capital News,'' ``The Marshall
Chronicles,'' `H.E.L.P.'' and ``Sunset Beat.''
   ABC renewed ``China Beach,'' ``Life Goes On,''
``thirtysomething,'' ``Roseanne'' and ABC News' ``PrimeTime Live''
and ``20-20'' series.
   But the cancellations included ``Anything But Love'' and
Saturday's ``ABC Mystery Movie'' quartet that had new versions of
yesteryear's ``Kojak'' and ``Columbo.''
   ABC put six new series on its fall roster.
   Three are sitcoms _ ``Baby Talk,'' based on the hit movie ``Look
Who's Talking''; ``Going Places,'' about four young adults in Los
Angeles working on their first TV show _ a ``candid videos''
series; and ``Married People,'' about three generations of married
couples sharing the same building.
   Capitalizing on its top-rated ``America's Funniest Home
Videos,'' ABC also will have ``America's Funniest ... Part II.''
   The two one-hour shows are Steven Bochco's ``Cop Rock,'' a blend
of music and police drama, and ``Gabriel's Fire,'' starring James
Earl Jones as a former convict-turned-private investigator.
   Whether ABC would renew ``Twin Peaks,'' a continuing saga of
sex, murder and jelly doughnuts set in a small logging town in the
Pacific Northwest, had caused some suspense _ but not as much as
who killed Laura Palmer.
   She's the high school homecoming queen, whose body was found at
the start of the show's premiere. Although ABC won't give critics
an advance look at the season's eighth and final episode this
month, the segment is expected to resolve her murder.
   The series has been shown on Thursdays, but the final episode
was moved to Wednesday to add its numbers to those ABC will get for
the May ratings ``sweeps,'' which end Wednesday night. The sweeps
period helps determine advertising rates for local stations.
   Preceded by heavy publicity and generally favorable reviews, the
two-hour premiere of ``Twin Peaks'' on April 8 got the highest
ratings of any two-hour movie aired last season, according to ABC.
It averaged a 21.7 rating and a 33 percent share of the audience in
its time period.
   But the show steadily lost viewers during the next six episodes
that ABC aired opposite NBC's top-rated ``Cheers.''
   ABC officials weren't immediately available to discuss why they
renewed the show. But industry observers said the network likely
would pick up the series because it is attracting a female audience
desirable to advertisers and it eventually might get a larger
general audience.
   Although Wednesday's episode could get high ratings because of
the murder mystery involved, last Thursday's show had a viewing
audience 51 percent smaller than for the premiere; the show gave
``Twin Peaks'' its lowest ratings to date _ a 10.6 rating and a 17
percent audience share.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.

<TEXT>
   Urban educators concerned that their students
will be overlooked in a national effort to improve education formed
a task force Monday aimed specifically at problems facing big city
schools.
   ``Over the last five years, numerous reports have been written
about the condition of urban education in this country,'' said
Joseph Fernandez, chancellor of New York City schools.
   ``While many of these reports contain excellent recommendations,
it is critical that the practitioners, those impacted most by the
recommendations, become involved in discussions of our national
education agenda,'' Fernandez said.
   Holmes Braddock, president-elect of the Council of the Great
City Schools, said the task force would develop its plan within
three years.
   Urban schools, he said, have heavy concentrations of minorities
or non-English speaking children as well as low-achievers and
low-income students. Other problems include crumbling facilities
and inadequate teaching materials.
   Fernandez will head the group, which will analyze goals that
include increasing expectations for all urban school students and
adequately staffing urban schools with qualified teachers ``who are
culturally and racially sensitive and who reflect the racial
characteristics of their students.''
   The task force also will review ways to restructure education in
urban areas, and discuss controversial ideas such as eliminating
grading and testing from kindergarten through third grade,
lengthening school days, team teaching and increased federal
financial commitment.
   Fernandez said the task force would seek ``bottom up''
approaches as opposed to the ``top down'' scenario offered by the
nation's governors. A final report on the urban goals will be
completed by Jan. 15, 1991.
   The national education goals, approved by President Bush and the
governors in February, are targeted for 2000.
   Those goals say all children will start school ready to learn,
high school graduation rates will increase to at least 90 percent,
American students will be first in the world in mathematics and
science, students will leave grades four, eight and 12 competent in
basic subjects, every American adult will be literate and every
school free of violence and drugs.
   The Council of the Great City Schools is a coalition of 45 of
the nation's largest urban school districts.

   The Supreme Court today allowed a permanent
ban on demonstrations by an anti-abortion group that blocked access
to abortion clinics in New York. It was th second legal setback in
two weeks for Operation Rescue.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal judge's order
that forbids Operation Rescue members from blocking women trying to
enter New York area abortion clinics.
   Operation Rescue members are under similar injunctions in other
cities.
   Today's action came a week after the high court, by a 5-4 vote,
left intact a similar ban on Operation Rescue blockades at abortion
clinics in Atlanta.
   But today's action is a bigger setback for Operation Rescue.
   The court's order in the Atlanta case was preliminary in nature.
The dispute had reached the justices as a request for emergency
help before Georgia courts had finished studying the controversy.
   The four justices who voted to allow demonstrations in Atlanta
said free-speech restrictions should not have been imposed before
Georgia courts had a chance to rule definitively.
   Today, the high court rejected a formal appeal by Operation
Rescue after lower courts ruled definitively against the group in
the New York case.
   And, in contrast to the Atlanta case, there were no dissenting
votes today.
   Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, said in a statement
about the ruling: ``No court can prohibit us from rescuing babies.
These judges have joined the heritage of Nazi judges who sanctioned
the murder of the innocent. The day of judgment will hold
terrifying consequences for them.''
   In other action, the court:
   _ Upheld a law requiring people convicted of federal crimes to
pay money into a fund to help crime victims.
   The court unanimously rejected arguments that the law is
unconstitutional because it originated in the Senate, and not in
the House of Representatives.
   _ Rejected an appeal by a company accused of illegal bias for
refusing to hire as a truck driver a Navajo Indian who used peyote
in religious ceremonies.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the company
engaged in illegal discrimination even though it offered to hire
the man after he complained to New Mexico officials.
   _ Ruled unanimously that defendants can be required to make
restitution only for specific crimes of which they are convicted,
not related alleged offenses.
   The justices said a former post office worker in Texas is not
required to pay a bank $90,431 he allegedly stole through credit
card fraud.
   _ Bolstered the federal government's power to control water used
by hydroelectric dams.
   Voting 9-0, the court struck down California regulations aimed
at assuring survival of trout in the American River and Rock Creek,
a small tributary of the river.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said the
Federal Power Act preempts California's stream-flow regulations.
   _ Ruled unanimously that monies given directly to Mormon
missionaries by the church's members are not deductible donations
under federal tax law.
   The court said Congress did not intend to make such direct
contributions tax-deductible.
   In the abortion case, the National Organization for Women and
other abortion rights advocates sued Operation Rescue and Terry in
a New York state court in 1988.
   The suit, seeking an end to the group's blockades, alleged
violations of several state laws and one federal law, the Ku Klux
Klan Act.
   Operation Rescue's lawyers had the case transferred to federal
court, where U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in early 1989
permanently enjoined the abortion clinic demonstrations.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Sept. 20 upheld
Ward's injunction, and became the nation's first federal appeals
court to rule that Operation Rescue's tactics violate women's civil
rights and are not a type of protected free speech.
   The group's members ``were trespassers without right,
constitutional or otherwise,'' the appeals court said. ``There is
no constitutional privilege to assault or harass an individual or
to invade another's personal space.''
   Among other things, the appeals court said the Operation Rescue
demonstrators had violated the Ku Klux Klan Act's ban on
conspiracies which violate the rights of a ``class of persons.''
   Acknowledging that the Civil War era law was aimed primarily at
protecting newly freed slaves, the appeals court said the law ``is
necessarily tied to evolving notions of equality and citizenship.''
   ``As conspiracies directed against women are inherently
invidious and repugnant to the notion of equality for all citizens,
they are therefore encompassed under the act,'' the 2nd Circuit
court ruled.
   Rejecting Operation Rescue's free-speech arguments, the appeals
court said, ``Blocking access to public and private buildings has
never been upheld as a proper method of communication in an orderly
society.''
   The appeals court upheld a $50,000 contempt-of-court fine issued
against Operation Rescue and Terry. But it ordered that the fine be
paid to the U.S. Treasury, not to the abortion rights advocates who
filed the lawsuit.
   In the appeal acted on today, Operation Rescue lawyers
contended, among other things, that women who seek abortions are
not among those protected by the federal civil rights law.
   The case is Terry vs. New York State NOW, 89-1408.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ABORTION

   CRIME VICTIMS FUND
   
   The court upheld a law requiring people convicted of federal
crimes to pay money into a fund to help crime vicims.
   The justices unanimously rejected arguments that the law is
unconstitutional because it originated in the Senate, and not in
the House of Representatives.
   The case is U.S. vs. Munoz-Flores, 88-1932.
   
   PEYOTE
   
   The court rejected an appeal by a company accused of illegal
bias for refusing to hire as a truck driver a Navajo Indian who
used peyote in religious ceremonies.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the company
engaged in illegal discrimination even though it offered to hire
the man after he complained to New Mexico officials.
   The case is U.S. vs. Munoz-Flores, 88-1932.
   
   CRIME RESTITUTION
   
   The court ruled unanimously that defendants can be required to
make restitution only for specific crimes of which they are
convicted, not related alleged offenses.
   The justices said a former post office worker in Texas is not
required to pay a bank $90,431 he allegedly stole through credit
card fraud.
   The case is Hughey vs. U.S., 89-5691.
   
   HYDROELECTRIC DAMS
   
   The court bolstered the federal government's power to control
water used by hydroelectric dams.
   Voting 9-0, the court struck down California regulations aimed
at assuring survival of trout in the American River and Rock Creek,
a small tributary of the river.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said the
Federal Power Act preempts California's stream-flow regulations.
   The case is California vs. FERC, 89-333.
   
   MORMONS
   
   The court ruled unanimously that monies given directly to Mormon
missionaries by the church's members are not deductible donations
under federal tax law.
   The court said Congress did not intend to make such direct
contributions tax-deductible.
   The case is Davis vs. U.S., 89-98.
   
   LIQUOR LABELING
   
   The court ruled states may impose labeling and reporting
requirements on liquor sold at U.S. military bases within their
borders, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court said North Dakota's regulation of liquor sold at two
military bases there does not violate a clause of the Constitution
which generally gives federal policy priority over state
regulations.
   The case is North Dakota vs. U.S., 88-926.

   The Supreme Court refused Monday to let an
anti-abortion group block the entrances to abortion clinics in New
York. It was the second high court setback in two weeks for
Operation Rescue.
   The justices' action was praised by abortion-rights advocates
and denounced by Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry. The court
left intact an order in which a federal judge permanently banned
the group's members from interfering with women entering New
York-area abortion clinics.
   Operation Rescue members are under similar injunctions in other
cities.
   ``It's a tremendous victory,'' said Bill Baird, who runs two
Long Island clinics where demonstrations have occurred repeatedly.
``I'd like to see the courts go further and assign federal marshals
to escort women in, just as they escorted blacks into buildings in
the 1960s,'' he said.
   Terry, in a statement released from Operation Rescue's office in
Binghamton, N.Y., said, ``No court can prohibit us from rescuing
babies. These judges have joined the heritage of Nazi judges who
sanctioned the murders of the innocent.''
   The justices took Monday's action _ not a formal ruling but a
denial of Operation Rescue's appeal _ without comment and without
any recorded dissenting vote.
   Just last week, the court voted 5-4 to leave intact a similar
ban on Operation Rescue blockades at abortion clinics in Atlanta.
   But Monday's action was a bigger setback for Operation Rescue.
The court's order in the Atlanta case was preliminary in nature.
The dispute had reached the justices as a request for emergency

said free-speech restrictions should not have been imposed before
the state courts had a chance to rule definitively.
   The high court Monday rejected a formal appeal by Operation
Rescue after lower courts ruled definitively against the group in
the New York case.
   The National Organization for Women and other abortion-rights
advocates sued Operation Rescue and Terry in a New York state court
in 1988.
   ``It's a humdinger ... couldn't be better,'' said NOW President
Molly Yard. ``They were breaking the law,'' she said, adding that
her organization is ready to seek court injunctions anywhere
Operation Rescue members try to bar access to clinics.
   The suit, seeking an end to the group's blockades, alleged
violations of several state laws and one federal law, the Ku Klux
Klan Act.
   Operation Rescue's lawyers had the case transferred to federal
court, where U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in early 1989
permanently enjoined the demonstrators.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Sept. 20 upheld
Ward's injunction and became the nation's first federal appeals
court to rule that Operation Rescue's tactics violate women's civil

   In other matters Monday, the Supreme Court:
   _Ruled unanimously in a case from Idaho that Mormons who
contribute money directly to the church's missionaries may not
deduct those donations from their federal taxes.
   _Enhanced the federal government's power to control water used
by hydroelectric dams, unanimously striking down California's
regulations to protect trout in the American River and its
tributaries.
   _Upheld a law requiring people convicted of federal crimes to
pay money into a fund to help crime victims. The court rejected
arguments in a case from California that the law is
unconstitutional because it originated in the Senate, not the House.

   NASA technicians began refilling
Columbia's cooling system Monday, one of the final steps in a long
series of repairs that grounded the shuttle.
   The space agency is working toward a May 30 liftoff, two weeks
later than planned because a bad cooling valve had to be replaced.
Columbia will carry seven astronauts and an on-board observatory.
   A new valve was installed last week after coolant was drained
from the shuttle, and the system tested favorably over the weekend,
said Lisa Malone, spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. It was the first time the work had been
performed at the launch pad.
   ``Everything's been going real well,'' she said.
   The process of replenishing the system with 29 gallons of the
refrigerant Freon was expected to be completed early Tuesday,
followed by sampling and other tests.
   An official launch date will be confirmed by mission managers on
Thursday. If May 30 stands, NASA estimates it will cost the agency
$250,000 to $500,000 in holiday weekend pay, said NASA spokesman
Bruce Buckingham.

   The army plans to introduce a bullet made of
compressed sand as a new riot deterrent in the occupied
territories, a military spokeswoman said Monday.
   The sand bullet, expected to be introduced in a few months, is
designed to be fired during close-range confrontations, she said.
   ``The aim is to reduce the force of impact. The bullet is not
meant to cause serious injuries, but to deter,'' the spokeswoman
said.
   Israeli soldiers will continue to use plastic bullets,
rubber-coated metal pellets and live ammunition in their battle
against the 29-month Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.
   More than 700 Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire in the
rebellion, and an additional 216 have been killed by other Arabs as
suspected pro-Israeli collaborators. Forty-three Israelis also have
been slain.
   In July 1988, the army introduced plastic bullets to break up
Palestinian demonstrations with a minimum of fatalities. Such
bullets are not supposed to be lethal if fired from a range of 70
yards.
   However, at least 128 Palestinians had been killed by plastic
bullets as of March 2, 1990, according to army figures.
   Neither the army nor Israeli human rights groups could provide
figures on fatalities resulting from the rubber bullets. However,
several Palestinians have been killed by the rubber bullets,
including the so-called ``improved'' round rubber bullets with an
enlarged metal core.

explicit black comedy by American director David Lynch, won the
Golden Palm award tonight as the best film at 43rd annual Cannes
Film Festival.
   Krystyna Janda of Poland won the best actress award for her
portrayal of a dissident who undergoes torture in ``The

   Military officers in El Salvador have risen to
power despite having commanded units linked to human rights abuses,
according to a report issued Monday on the eve of a congressional
battle over cutting U.S. military aid.
   The congressional study said 14 of the country's 15 senior
military commanders have commanded units that are documented to
have killed civilians, tortured prisoners, carried out kidnappings
or covered up such abuses.
   ``The promotion to senior positions of so many officers whose
troops committed repeated abuses of human rights, and the absence
of prosecutions of even junior officers for these abuses, suggest
that at a basic level there is little accountability,'' concluded
the report by the Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus.
   The report, underscoring the already tarnished reputation of the
Salvadoran military, was issued the day before a partisan House
floor battle over U.S. military aid to El Salvador. The aid totals
$85 million this year and the Bush administration wants the same
level for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   But some Democrats claim they will narrowly win a vote to slash
the military aid in half this year and next, and to impose
conditions to pressure the government and leftist rebels to reach a
negotiated peace.moved.

   More than 80 AIDS activists were arrested
at the National Institutes of Health today during a demonstration
calling for more AIDS research by government scientists.
   Nearly a thousand protesters draped red streamers through the
trees outside a number of NIH buildings to symbolize the red tape
of the bureaucracy that they say is slowing down work to find a
cure for AIDS.
   The demonstrators moved from building to building, chanting
slogans and erecting cardboard head stones on the lawns of some of
the buildings.
   Bob Shriver, a spokesman for the National Institutes of Health,
said about 60 people were arrested on trespassing charges at the
main Bethesda campus. He estimated the crowd at about 900. At the
Rockville office of the director of AIDS Research for the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 21 demonstrators were
arrested on loitering charges, Montgomery County police said.
   Police said the demonstrators had the option of paying a $50
fine or requesting a court date. All those arrested were freed,
authorities said.
   Mark Harrington of the New York-based AIDS Coalition To Unleash
Power, ACT UP, said the activists want NIH to put more emphasis on
drugs that fight the opportunistic infections that kill AIDS
patients, whose immune systems are weakened by the disease.
   He said they also want more research into new anti-viral drugs
that work differently from AZT. AZT is currently the only approved
anti-viral drug that fights the AIDS virus directly.
   The demonstrators say government researchers have focused too
much of their work on AZT and have failed to start studies on other
anti-viral drugs. Since AZT was approved, researchers have been
studying its effectiveness on people in different stages of the
disease.
   ``We're just trying to get them to change the rules,''
Harrington said.
   For years AIDS activists had directed their criticism at the
Food and Drug Administration, saying health officials there were
too slow in approving new drugs to fight the disease and the
infections it causes.
   But activists have shifted their focus to NIH, saying the FDA
``can't approve drugs that aren't there.''
   ``Now we're mad because approaches that are promising aren't
being pursued,'' Harrington said.
   The protesters also complained that government-sponsored studies
have enrolled very few women, blacks, Hispanics and drug users. One
group of women in the demonstration held up a banner that said,
``Women are invisible at NIH.''

<HEAD>Soviets Sending Experts Here This Week in Pre-Summit Push for
Accord</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
sending arms experts here later in the week to resume pre-summit
negotiations to cut long-range nuclear weapons, and they will find
the Bush administration in a mood to strike a deal.
   The negotiators will take up a half-dozen issues that were not
resolved by Secretary of State James A. Baker III last week in
Moscow. The aim is to settle as many as they can before Gorbachev
arrives May 30 for summit talks with President Bush.
   The U.S. strategy is to look for a tradeoff, accepting the
position taken by the Soviets on some issues in exchange for their
agreeing to the U.S. stand on others, a senior U.S. official said
Monday. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Bush administration is not tipping its hand about its
priorities before the talks begin, Wednesday or Thursday at the
State Department. But one of the main U.S. objectives is to keep
the Soviets from improving their powerful SS-18 nuclear missiles.
   As part of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the Soviets
already have agreed to reduce their arsenal of 308 of these
land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles by 50 percent _ to
154.
   The Bush administration would like to halt improvements in the
missiles that will remain, but is reluctant to accept curbs on its
own arsenal of deadly multi-warhead ballistic missiles carried
aboard nuclear submarines.
   Other unsettled issues include how many land-based mobile
missiles would be allowed, whether the Soviet Backfire bomber
should be regulated and how to verify compliance with a START
treaty.
   Another tough issue _ restricting nuclear-tipped cruise missiles
_ was resolved during the four days of talks Baker held in Moscow.
   That breakthrough involved a tradeoff. Baker accepted the range
limitations proposed by the Soviets on cruise missiles carried
aboard airplanes while the Soviets agreed to exclude the new U.S.
Tacit Rainbow air-to-surface missile from any restraints.
   Also, the Soviets gave in to the U.S. demand that there be no
inspection of cruise missiles carried aboard submarines.
   Baker's trip also produced what he called a ``trailblazing''
U.S.-Soviet agreement to end the production of chemical weapons.
But with the summit only 10 days away, the two sides are
concentrating on trying to reach agreement on as many strategic
weapons reductions as they can include in a declaration to be
initialed by Bush and Gorbachev.
   The Soviet delegation will be headed by Aleksander Bessmertnykh,
a close adviser to Gorbachev. He is due to present his credentials
to Bush next Monday as the new Soviet ambassador. Under Secretary
of State Reginald Bartholomew will head the U.S. team.
   Meanwhile, U.S. and Soviet negotiators are continuing to work on
the treaty in Geneva. The proposed text runs 400 to 500 pages. Even
if all key issues are settled it will take several months, at
least, to complete it.
   Work in Vienna on another treaty to cut U.S. and Soviet troops,
tanks, artillery, airplanes and helicopters in Europe has slowed
down. Baker was unable to perk up the negotiations during his
meetings in Moscow with Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   The Soviets are reluctant to pull 600,000 soldiers out of
Central Europe until they are assured the German army also will be
sharply reduced.
   Even so, the Bush administration intends to go as far as it can
in completing the START treaty.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said Monday the
administration would not delay completing one accord while the
other lagged. ``START can be a very important agreement,'' he said.
   The treaty would cut U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons
by 30 percent to 35 percent, overall.

   A bomb hidden under a parked car
exploded in a crowded marketplace Monday, seriously injuring eight
people, police said.
   The bomb blew up outside a hotel in the Shoba Bazaar, the city's
busiest shopping area, police said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, which
badly damaged the hotel lobby and the adjacent office of Gulf Air
and destroyed three vehicles.
   Hundreds of bombs have exploded in recent years in the Northwest
Frontier Province and its capital, Peshawar. Agents of the
Soviet-backed government in neighboring Afghanistan are routinely
blamed.
   Pakistan is the base of U.S.-supported guerrillas fighting to
overthrow Afghanistan's communist-style government.
   The blast occurred a day after government officials said two
Afghan warplanes intruded into Pakistani air space and bombed the
border area of Waziristan.
   The officials said the jets dropped two bombs on unpopulated
mountainous areas.

<HEAD>David Wood Dead, Former Political Editor of The Times</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Wood, a journalist who reported life at the
top of British politics with deep knowledge and insight for The
Times of London, has died at 75, his former newspaper reported
Monday.
   Wood died Friday, according to the newspaper. The cause of death
was not disclosed.
   His best-remembered exclusive was his disclosure on June 1,
1959, that Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd had been told by Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan that ``enough was enough'' and he would
be transferred to another Cabinet post in several months' time.
   The report created an international sensation because Lloyd was
then in Geneva attending a pre-summit conference of the prime
ministers of the so-called Big Four nations _ British, French,
Soviet and U.S. - and his position was undermined.
   Lloyd was a controversial figure because he had been foreign
secretary during the Anglo-French secret collusion with Israel and
invasion of Egypt over the Suez crisis in 1956.
   Macmillan and government information officers denied Wood's
report on Lloyd, but it was Macmillan himself who had given Wood
the information. Lloyd was made chancellor of the exchequer the
following year.
   Later, when top officials of the Conservative Party were
discussing who would succeed Macmillan, Wood reported accurately
what was going on and ranking Tories tried to have him thrown out
of his job. They were rebuffed by the late Sir William Haley, who
is remembered as one of the great editors of the 205-year-old
newspaper.
   Wood, a laborer's son, became a reporter in his hometown of
Grantham when he was 14. He was a fast shorthand writer and in
reporting the town council he got to know Alderman Alfred Roberts,
whose daughter Margaret is today Prime Minister Thatcher.
   In World War II, Wood served in tanks in North Africa and was an
intelligence officer in France and Germany. He joined The Times in
1948 and was its political editor for more than 20 years.
   His Monday morning articles on the background of politics were
essential reading for all legislators and notable for the fine
quality of writing and their political insight, The Times obituary
said.
   Wood retired in 1979.
   He is survived by a son and a daughter.

<HEAD>Eagleburger: Latin America Will Be Top Foreign Policy Priority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin America will gain ``a place of first
importance'' in U.S. foreign policy as the Cold War ebbs, Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said Monday.
   Eagleburger's statement, delivered before an audience of
corporate executives, was clearly intended to reassure Latin
American leaders worried that their region will get scant attention
in the growing U.S. fascination with the collapse of communism in
Eastern Europe.
   The focus of U.S. policy will ``increasingly and inevitably be
drawn to our own hemisphere'' as relations with the Soviet Union
improve and democracy becomes rooted in the former Soviet bloc,
Eagleburger said.
   ``We may well be at the edge of removing from the U.S. foreign
policy agenda the tremendous concern with East-West relations that
has, of necessity, dominated the agenda for the last 45 years,'' he
said.
   ``The world is clearly changing,'' Eagleburger said, adding that
the changes ``will clearly redound to the benefit of Latin
America.''
   Eagleburger said it was natural for the United States to expend
considerable energy in Europe because ``the prospect of ending the
Cold War is of overriding stategic importance.''
   But, he said, long-term responsibility for aiding the nations of
Eastern Europe in their struggle to install democratic institutions
and revive prosperity will be borne by their West European
neighbors.
   Success in ending the East-West struggle and fostering stability
and prosperity in Europe will open a new chapter in U.S. foreign
policy, he said.
   ``The ending of the Cold War should bring with it a
demilitarization of foreign policy'' and a new set of economic and
political challenges, especially in Latin America, Eagleburger said.
   As a result of improvements in East-West relations, ``Latin
America is going to occupy a place of first importance in U.S.
foreign policy,'' he said.
   U.S. trade with Latin America ``will be seen as a vital national
interest,'' in part to promote democracy, prosperity and stability
and in part out of sheer self-interest, he said.
   ``But it is an interest that will be increasingly threatened if
the region remains mired in debt and unable to buy our products,''
Eagleburger said.
   It is clear, he said, the United States and Latin America will
have to move to open up trade, to boost U.S. investment and the
flow of technology and to help solve Latin America's crushing debt
problems.
   ``Statist and protectionist policies must be fully rolled
back,'' he said. ``If the door is not opened wide enough,
investment will go elsewhere.''
   Eagleburger also predicted the United States will take a ``a
much more open attitude toward free-trade agreements,'' but
acknowleged that negotiating them country by country will be time
consuming and difficult.

   Ten candles burned in the upstairs windows at
the White House, a signal of Barbara Bush's support for an
international AIDS memorial.
   The candles were placed in the windows of the residence
overlooking Lafayette Park on Sunday night, as 2,000 people rallied
by candlelight at the Lincoln Memorial a mile away to remember
victims of AIDS.
   The gathering was part of the seventh annual International AIDS
Candlelight Memorial in which people around the world held vigils
for those who have died or are afflicted with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The crowd that lined both sides of the Reflecting Pool Sunday
evening cheered when it was announced that Mrs. Bush had placed
candles in the White House windows.
   ``She was asked to participate. That was her participation,''
Anna Perez, Mrs. Bush's press secretary, told reporters Monday.
   Mrs. Bush made no mention of it Monday during brief remarks
following a White House luncheon for Senate and Cabinet wives. A
dance troupe of handicapped youths called the New Visions Dance
Theater performed in the East Room.
   Mrs. Bush herself left afterward for New York and Kennebunkport,
Maine, where she planned to spend the week at the Bushes'
oceanfront home. President Bush will join her there Friday for the
Memorial Day weekend.

<HEAD>Tax Receipts Spur Record Budget Surplus in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A surge in income tax payments helped the
government set a record $42.52 billion budget surplus in April, one
month after a record monthly deficit, the Treasury Department
reported Monday.
   April's receipts reduced the deficit so far for the fiscal year
that started last Oct. 1 to $108.34 billion, down from $150.85
billion in March but still 23.3 percent more than the deficit at
this time last year.
   And the deficit still was more than the $100 billion target set
by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law with five more months
remaining in fiscal 1990.
   The March deficit had been $53.34 billion, topping the previous
record of $39.4 billion in May 1986.
   The Bush administration budget last January estimated the 1990
deficit to be $123.8 billion, although officials admit it will be
revised upward because of the unexpected costs of the savings and
loan bailout, increased interest rates and a less-than-expected
revenue.
   The Congressional Budget Office in March projected the deficit
to be $159 billion.
   Revenues last month were up 8.3 percent from April 1989 to
$139.624 billion, while spending rose 9.9 percent to $97.107
billion.
   The biggest previous monthly surplus was the $40.57 billion of
April 1989.
   Individual income tax receipts totaled $74.38 billion last
month, up from $68.53 billion in April 1989. Corporate income taxes
payments, however, fell from $14.69 billion in April 1989 to $13.38
billion last month.
   Louis Crandall, chief economist for R.H. Wrightson &amp; Associates
in New York, said the unexpectedly large income tax receipts were
due to payments that usually are posted in May being entered in
April's books.
   ``It's setting us up for a very steep May deficit,'' he said.
   Revenues for the first seven months of fiscal 1990 totaled
$597.92 billion, up 4.9 percent from the same period of fiscal
1989. Spending totaled $706.26 billion, a 7.4 percent advance over
the first seven months of the last fiscal year.
   The biggest spending categories, as usual, were the military,
Social Security and other programs for the Department of Health and
Human Services, and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $21.39 billion for the month and
$166.86 billion so far this year. It is projected to total $286.79
billion for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $18.87 billion for the
month and $138.24 billion for the year so far. They are projected
to total $244.59 billion for the year.
   Other HHS programs including Medicare and Medicaid totaled
$16.81 billion during April and $109.46 billion thus far. They are
projected to total $191.17 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $16.57 billion for the
month and $145.84 billion so far this year. It is projected to
total $254.85 billion for the entire year.

<HEAD>Court Bolsters Federal Power to Control Water Use in California
Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS grafs 5-6: ``California's appeal,'' with one graf to
CORRECT that all other 49 states, sted 43, supported California</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today bolstered the federal
government's power to control water used by hydroelectric dams.
   Voting 9-0, the court struck down California regulations aimed
at assuring survival of trout in the American River and Rock Creek,
a small tributary of the river.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said the
Federal Power Act preempts California's stream-flow regulations.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ``has indicated
that the California requirements interfere with its comprehensive
planning authority and we agree that allowing California to impose
the challenged requirements would be contrary to congressional
intent,'' O'Connor said.
   California's appeal was supported by all 49 other states, who
said a victory for the federal government threatened state control
over water resources.
   Leading environmental groups, including American Rivers, the
National Audubon Society and the Sierra Club, had said a victory
for the federal government would shield ill-conceived hydroelectric
development from state regulation.
   FERC in 1983 licensed construction of a hydroelectric power
project on Rock Creek near Placerville, Calif.
   The owner of the dam, Rock Creek Limited Partnership, planned to
generate electric power to be sold to the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. for use by the utility's customers.
   The California Water Resources Control Board sought to limit the
flow of water over the dam by requiring that enough water would
continue to flow in Rock Creek to assure suvival of the trout
population.
   The federal agency in 1987 said it has exclusive control over
how much water should flow over the dam.
   Today's ruling upheld a decision last year by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The justices relied heavily on a 1944 high court ruling that
gave states control over water distribution only for limited
purposes _ for irrigation and city water supplies.
   O'Connor said, ``There has been no sufficient intervening change
in the law or indication that (the 1944 ruling) has proved
unworkable or has fostered confusion and inconsistency in the law
that warrants our departure from established precedent.''
   The case is California vs. FERC, 89-333.

   ``Twin Peaks'' will be back next fall along with
``China Beach'' but there will be no more ``Elvis'' sightings, ABC
said Monday.
   The new schedule, unveiled shortly before the scheduled release
of NBC's fall roster, contains six new series, including Steven
Bocho's hourlong ``Cop Rock,'' a mix of cops and musical production
numbers.
   ``Elvis'' wasn't the only midseason ABC show to get the ax.
``Brewster Place,'' starring talk show star Oprah Winfrey, was
canceled, too. Also out: ``Capital News,'' ``The Marshall
Chronicles,'' `H.E.L.P.'' and ``Sunset Beat.''
   All had low ratings. But so did ``Twin Peaks,'' directed by
David Lynch of ``Blue Velvet'' fame and one of this season's most
written about new series. A dark saga of sex, murder and jelly
doughnuts, it had top ratings of 21.7 for its April 8 premiere, but
has steadily lost viewers, despite even a favorable New York Times
editorial.
   This Wednesday's season-closing episode likely will have high
ratings because it is to resolve the murder of a key character, a
high school beauty named Laura Palmer. The mystery even has touched
off sales of T-shirts marked ``I Killed Laura Palmer'' in
California, an ABC spokesman said.
   But last Thursday's show gave the series its lowest Nielsens to
date _ a 10.6 rating and a 17 percent audience share. Each ratings
point represents 921,000 homes.
   Still, ABC spokesman Tom Mackin said the network expects the
ratings will improve next season when the series follows the
renewed ``China Beach'' in the latter's new time slot on Saturday
nights.
   Other ABC renewals include the high-rated ``Roseanne,'' and
``thirtysomething,'' ``Life Goes On,'' and ABC News' ``PrimeTime
Live'' and ``20-20'' series.
   Three of the five other new series on ABC's roster are sitcoms _
``Baby Talk,'' based on the hit movie ``Look Who's Talking'';
``Going Places,'' about four young adults in Los Angeles working on
their first TV show _ a ``candid videos'' series; and ``Married
People,'' about three generations of married couples sharing the
same brownstone in New York.
   Capitalizing on its top-rated ``America's Funniest Home
Videos,'' ABC also will have ``America's Funniest ... Part II.''
   James Earl Jones, whose ``Paris'' police series on CBS flopped a

   A Shiite Moslem leader who aided in the
recent release of an American hostage said the shooting deaths of
seven Palestinians in Israel meant the time had come to settle
scores with the United States.
   Hussein Musawi, leader of a pro-Syrian wing of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, said the level of violence in the uprising in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip should escalate.
   He also warned that more attacks on Palestinians could be
expected as Israel tries to find room for hundreds of thousands of
Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   On Sunday, an Israeli shot and killed seven Palestinians day
laborers in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Letzion. Violent protests
broke out in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank in
response.
   ``The real retaliation to this massacre is in escalating the
suicide attacks in the occupied territories and outside them, and a
serious settlement of accounts with the Americans,'' he said.
   Musawi, speaking from his Baalbek headquarters, did not specify
how the Americans were involved or what actions would be taken. He
did not mention the 16 Western hostages.
   Musawi urged extremist kidnappers holding American hostages to
release a captive last month as goodwill gesture. After the April
22 freeing of Robert Polhill, he said the kidnappers expected
reciprocity from the United States.
   Musawi was against the release of Frank Herbert Reed on April 30
after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding
resolution recognizing Jerusalem as the united capital of Israel.
   Jerusalem is the third-holiest site in Islam and the eastern
portion was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Israel war.
   The 16 Westerners held include six Americans, four Britons, two
West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman. Longest-held
is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Elsewhere in Lebanon, black flags and Palestinian banners waved
across Palestinian refugee camps to protest the violence in Israel.
Angry Palestinians took to the streets of the camps in separate
demonstrations.
   Shops, schools and businesses in the camps closed Monday in
protest.
   In west Beirut's devastated Bourj el-Barajneh camp, children
carrying stones in their fists and Palestinian guerrillas armed
with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles, led the
demonstrators.
   ``The people of the West Bank and Galilee will not knuckle
under,'' chanted the protestors, estimated at about 2,500.
   A similar demonstration occured in south Lebanon's largest camp
of Ein el-Hilweh, the Palestine Liberation Organization's main
military base. Thousands of people roamed the shantytown chanting
anti-Israeli slogans and calling for armed struggle.

<BYLINE>Mosbacher Calls U.S. Business Too Slow in Eastern Europe
^By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said
Thursday that U.S. business has been too slow to take advantage of
opportunities in an Eastern European nations moving away from
communism.
   Mosbacher recalled that Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national
security adviser to former President Carter, was surprised at the
slow pace of investment compared to the moves into Spain and
Portugal when dictatorships ended in those countries.
   ``I second Dr. Brzezinski's statement,'' Mosbacher said. ``Spain
and Portugal have come a long way in 20 years _ and so have
American businesses who went into those countries early.
   ``In 1990 U.S. business is on the doorstep of another historic
opportunity, and we have a truly unique advantage. Our nation has
long been a symbol of hope in eastern Europe, not only as leader of
the free world for the last 45 years, but in centuries past.''
   Mosbacher appeared at a seminar on business relations between
the United States, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union that
included Stanislav V. Assekritov, deputy chairman of the Soviet
State Commission for Economic Reform.
   The commerce secretary told Assekritov he believed in Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts, but he declined to
answer a question from Assekritov about prospects for a trade
agreement.
   ``I think we better leave (that) to our respective presidents
and to the hopes the Soviet Union will very soon pass their
emigration bill,'' he said.
   The United States has made a trade agreement contingent on a new
Soviet law to allow free emigration. The Supreme Soviet may take
the legislation up at the end of the month. The Soviets had hoped
to sign the trade pact at the May 30-June 3 superpower summit, but
the crackdown in Lithuania may jeopardize that schedule.

<HEAD>Former Diplomat Says He Gave Indonesian Officials Names of
Communists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. diplomat said Monday that he
gave Indonesian military authorities the names of high-ranking
communists who were subsequently killed in a 1965 purge that
terrorized the country.
   Robert J. Martens, who was a political officer at the U.S.
Embassy in Jakarta, said he gleaned the names of thousands of
Partai Kommunis Indonesia, or PKI, activists from the media.
   The same reports were available to Indonesian authorities but
Martens said the officials were disorganized and didn't appear to
have the names.
   PKI, with 3.5 million members and as many as 18 million people
affiliated with it, was the largest communist party in the world
and was active in every level of government and the military.
   Martens, now an adviser to the State Department, said the PKI
was in danger of taking control of Indonesia at a time when
communists were flexing their muscle throughout Asia.
   The purge of the PKI at the end of 1965 coincided with the start
of U.S. activity against the communists in Vietnam.
   Among the names he provided were all the members of the PKI's
central committee, Martens said in an interview.
   ``I thought it was the right thing to do,'' he said. ``I have no
regrets.''
   Martens said he gave names of activists in the cities and within
the party apparatus, and not in the provinces. Martens said he and
other U.S. officials were aware that Indonesia's military leader,
Gen. Suharto, was rounding up PKI cadres and was determined to
annihilate the party.
   Martens said he dealt with Suharto loyalists, who were opposed
to then-President Sukarno and his support for the left wing.
Sukarno opposed the crackdown, but he had lost power to such an
extent that he effectively relinquished his post to Suharto in 1966.
   Suharto has beens president since 1968.
   Martens said he made the decision to provide the names, thinking
it was standard practice to share information with host governments
and that ``it wasn't a big deal.''
   He said he hadn't consulted with his superiors and only told
them about it several years later.
   The former deputy chief of the CIA station in Jakarta, Joseph
Lazarsky, and Martens' boss, Edward Masters, said CIA employees
contributed to the PKI lists, according to a report published
Monday by States News Service, a small Washington-based news
service.
   States News Service reported that U.S. officials used Martens'
list to check off the names of PKI members who were killed. It said
a 1968 CIA report estimated the number of those killed at 250,000.
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield denied that the agency was involved
in the preparation or distribution of a list used to track down PKI
members.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said PKI leaders were
well known to Indonesian authorities.
   ``It's highly unlikely that we could have provided any
information which was not known to the Indonesian government of the
time,'' Boucher said. ``And, of course, we would not have provided
names of people for the purposes'' of having them killed.
   Martens said the government had not put together any names
because it was ``petrified'' by the assassination of six
anti-communist generals. The military blamed the killings on the
PKI and launched the purge that virtually destroyed the party.

   Chrysler Corp. is recalling some 1987-model
Jeep Cherokee, Comanche and Wagoneer models to replace catalytic
converters that overheat and break down, the Environmental
Protection Agency said Monday.
   The recalled vehicles are those built before Oct. 16, 1986 and
equipped with the 2.5-liter fuel-injected engine. Vehicles sold in
California, which has different pollution standards than the other
states, are included in the recall.
   The agency said an insulation layer between the inner and outer
layers of the converter assembly traps too much heat, damaging the
ceramic catalyst support inside and destroying the effectiveness of
the converter.
   The problem was discovered in routine EPA tests that showed the
Jeep models exceeding federal emission standards for all
pollutants, EPA said.
   The agency said 11,056 Jeep models were produced with the
defective catalysts. An unknown number of owners have replaced the
converters under warranty, and they will not receive recall notices.
   The converter sits in the exhaust pipe to turn pollutants into
harmless substances.

<HEAD>Lithuania Mulls Compromise Offer; Latvia, Estonian Leaders to
Moscow</HEAD>

   A strike by pro-Moscow forces in Estonia failed to
win widespread support Monday when many workers ignored a call to
walk off the job in protest of the republic's independence drive.
   In Lithuania, lawmakers put together a new offer aimed at
breaking the republic's deadlock with Moscow. Also Monday, the
presidents of Estonia and Latvia arrived in Moscow for talks with
Kremlin officials, reports said.
   The three Baltic republics _ Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia _
were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union 50 years ago, and all are
in varying stages of efforts to break free of Moscow's control.
   The contents of the proposal drafted by Lithuanian lawmakers _
which must be voted on by the Lithuanian legislature as a whole _
were not revealed, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   But Tass quoted Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera
Prunskiene, as saying it touched on the issue of whether to back
off on Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence.
   Gorbachev has demanded lawmakers suspend the declaration; they
have so far refused to comply, but have offered to consider
rescinding measures aimed at implementing the declaration.
   Lithuania is feeling the squeeze from the cutoff of oil, natural
gas and other raw materials imposed by Moscow more than a month ago.
   Lithuanian parliamentary spokesman Rita Dapkus said Monday that
total industrial, construction and transportation layoffs topped
12,100, not counting taxi and bus drivers idled by the resulting
shortage of gasoline.
   In the agricultural sector, the embargo has forced the shutdown
of 712 enterprises, or 60 percent of the republic's total, Ms.
Dapkus said.
   On May 14, Gorbachev decreed that steps toward independence by
Latvia and Estonia violated the constitution, but he has not taken
any punitive actions against those two republics.
   The presidents of Estonia and Latvia arrived in Moscow on Monday
for talks with Kremlin officials, the Estonian News Service
reported.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel and Latvian President Anatoly
Gorbunov planned to meet Tuesday with members of Gorbachev's
advisory body on the nation's republics and nationalities, the news
service said.
   Ruutel told a news conference a private meeting with Gorbachev
was possible.
   Tuesday's talks would be the second session in less than a week
between Kremlin officials and Baltic leaders. Mrs. Prunskiene met
with Gorbachev on Thursday.
   In Estonia, there were conflicting reports on the success of the
anti-independence forces' strike call, but most accounts suggested
the walkouts were far from crippling.
   Artur Kopytyn of the anti-independence Russian Strike Committee
claimed there were strikes Monday at 18 enterprises.
   But Estonian Radio, together with Estonian journalist Tarmu
Tammerk, said stoppages hit no more than six or seven enterprises
whose work was not vital to everyday life in the republic.
   ``The city is calm, the workday is over and there were no
incidents,'' Tammerk said by telephone from Tallinn, the republic's
capital. ``The strike seems to be a failure for today.''
   Government spokesman Juhan Hindov said pressure for the strikes
was coming from pro-Moscow administrators at the factories and from
the Russian Strike Committee, ``but people do not want to strike.''
   Estonia's prime minister, Edgar Savisaar, told Estonian radio no
more than 10 businesses were on strike and that five or six others
would join Tuesday.
   ``We're too poor to strike,'' one burly, unidentified worker
told the evening Soviet television newscast ``Vremya,'' which noted
there was little support of the call to walk off the job.
   Kopytyn, in a telephone interview, said he could not say how
many workers participated in Monday's strikes. But he said they
would continue Tuesday and support would be ``bigger and bigger and
bigger.''
   He acknowledged, however, that bus drivers and other transport
employees did not take part in the job action.
   ``The agitators ... made all they could to call people to the
strike,'' said Mati Magi, director of the Tallinn Bus Enterprises.
``But our Russian drivers would not join the action.''
   Sixty-five percent of the republic's 1.8 million population is
Estonian. Russians make up 28 percent, with Ukrainians and
Byelorussians making up the rest.
   Russians and other minorities in all three Baltic republics
complain that they are discriminated against as a result of the
independence movements.

<HEAD>Report Outlines Effects of Much Larger Wheat Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dramatic increase in wheat production this
year will help rebuild U.S. stockpiles and probably will mean
stiffer regional competition for some export markets, an
Agriculture Department report said Monday.
   Total wheat output has been projected at more than 2.69 billion
bushels, a rise of more than 650 million bushels from the
weather-reduced 1989 harvest.
   It would be the biggest year-to-year increase on record, besides
resulting in the nation's third-largest wheat harvest, the report
said. Winter wheat alone is forecast at 2.09 billion bushels, up 44
percent from 1989.
   As a result of the larger crop, lean stockpiles are expected to
increase by June 1, 1991, to about 765 million bushels from an
estimated 442 million bushels this June 1.
   Wheat prices received by farmers in 1990-91 are forecast at
$2.90 to $3.30 per bushel, down from an average of $3.71 in 1989-90
and $3.72 in the 1988-89 marketing year.
   ``The 1990-91 price relationships and competition across classes
(kinds) of wheat may change dramatically from 1989-90,'' the report
said. ``Supplies of hard red winter wheat will be up sharply,
resulting in more competition with hard red spring for the hard
wheat market.''
   Hard red winter wheat is concentrated in Kansas and other parts
of the central and southern Great Plains, while hard red spring
wheat is mostly in northern areas. White wheat is grown mainly in
the Pacific Northwest and soft red winter is raised in the eastern
third of the country.
   ``Larger crops and reduced imports are expected in South Asia,''
the report said. ``This will mean that the larger U.S. white wheat
crop will have to compete with soft red winter for export markets
such as Egypt that take both classes of wheat.''

<HEAD>U.S. Sees ``Important Beginning'' With Romanian Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Monday said Romania's
first free elections since 1937 represent ``an important
beginning'' but that the new government will have to improve the
democratic process.
   Richard Boucher, the State Department's deputy spokesman, said
election observers sent to Romania by the Bush administration
reported voting was ``free, peaceful and enthusiastic,'' and that
turn out was heavy with long lines at the polls.
   ``We note that problems with voting and other election day
irregularities appear to have been minimal, although opposition
political party leaders have complained of breaches of election law
procedures,'' Boucher said.
   ``We see this as an important beginning for Romania,'' he said.
   But he said the election campaign itself was flawed by
candidates' lack of access to the news media and the intimidation
of opposition candidates, he said.
   ``Further improving the process of democracy will be a key task
of whatever government emerges in Romania,'' Boucher said.
   Boucher said there were no conclusions about possible U.S.
economic aid to Romania because ``our assessment of the elections
is only now beginning.''
   The first official returns in Romania showed interim President
Ion Iliescu, a former Communist, with an overwhelming lead in the
presidential race. His National Salvation Front appeared to be
headed for victory in the parliamentary elections, which would
allow him to govern without forming a coalition with the opposition.

<HEAD>Le Pen Hometown Says No To Right-Wing Gathering</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TRINITE-SUR-MER, France (AP) _ The hometown of extreme
right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen refused Monday to let him bring
in a gathering of like-minded politicians from around Europe.
   A majority of Trinite-Sur-Mer's 15 municipal legislators voted
to reject the request by the town's most famous son to allow a
meeting of extreme-right European leaders next month.
   His birthplace, a coastal resort of 56,000 people on the
Atlantic coast, joined Vichy, Aurillac, Angouleme, Lorient and
Poitiers in turning away the chief of the anti-immigrant National
Front party.
   Councilors cited public objections to renting a public hall to
Le Pen, who frequently makes anti-Semitic remarks, following a
series of desecrations at Jewish cemeteries around France.
   The council also objected to the likely presence of Franz
Schoenhuber, a former Waffen SS soldier who heads West Germany's
far-right Republican Party.
   ``We have had enough of seeing our town associated with the
image of Le Pen,'' three assistant mayors declared in a joint
statement last week. ``We prefer the image of the sailing capital
of Brittany.''
   About 400 citizens signed a petition asking the council to turn
down the National Front's request to use the public meeting hall
during the meeting planned June 5-8.
   In Paris, the City Council held a moment of silence Monday in
honor of the dead whose graves were found defiled May 10 in the
southern town of Carpentras.
   The desecration of the 34 graves and mutilation of a corpse
touched off a wave of vandalism in France, but also prompted public
demonstrations against a perceived rise in anti-Semitism.

   As early returns indicated a landslide
for the interim government, bitter disappointment set in Monday
among opposition activists in the town where the December
revolution began.
   The National Salvation Front ``did not make the revolution _
they came to power because of it, and now they have finally stolen
it from the people of Timisoara,'' said Gheorghe Serban, of the
Timisoara Society, a civic group formed during the uprising.
   A West German exit poll of 14,539 voters indicated interim
president Ion Iliescu of the Front would win 83 percent of the
votes nationwide. National Liberal Party candidate, Radu Campeanu,
was second with 11 percent, and Ion Ratiu of the National Peasant
Party had 6 percent.
   Early returns appeared to confirm the sweep of the Front, a
party with several former Communists, including Iliescu.
   But with 20 percent of the vote counted in Timisoara, Iliescu
had 77 percent and the Front's share of the parliamentary vote was
54 percent, less than the nationwide average.
   The results reflected Timisoara's proximity to the West, rather
than the Soviet Union, and its ethnic blend of Romanians,
Hungarians and Serbs.
   It was an ethnic Hungarian pastor, now Bishop Laszlo Toekes,
whose threatened deportation prompted the protests that became
Timisoara's, and then the nation's, revolt against longtime
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Also born in the city was the so-called Timisoara Declaration, a
document drawn up by activists and later adopted by Bucharest
demonstrators who wanted all former Communists out of Romanian
politics.
   The civic groups spawned by the revolution campaigned for Radu
Campeanu, head of the centrist National Liberal Party. He was the
younger and less aristocratic of the two former exiles who
challenged Iliescu.
   Campeanu appeared headed for about 17 percent of the vote in
Timisoara, reflecting some success in the campaign.
   Nonetheless, Timisoara's opposition was bitter. They felt
cheated out of recognition they felt was their due.
   Serban said Iliescu mounted a propaganda campaign to convince
Romanians that only 93 people died in the Timisoara uprising,
``when we all know that 20 times as many gave their lives for our
freedom.''
   Final casualty figures for the revolution have never been
released, but observers have said hundreds and perhaps thousands
died in the fighting.
   A sense of shock was tangible in the Liberals' Timisoara
headquarters Monday. Volunteers shuffled among heaps of campaign
literature and returning electoral officials brought further news
of the party's defeat.
   Some of the opposition alleged fraud in the vote in their
attempt to explain what was apparently a stunning loss.
   ``We don't know what, but something is not right in all this,''
said party spokesman Marius Lapugean. He alleged ``numerous
irregularities,'' including inadequate voter registration lists and
a lack of ballot boxes.
   More impartial observers attributed Iliescu's apparent triumph
even in Timisoara in part to what they termed the vehemence of the
anti-Front campaign waged by the Liberals and Peasants.
   ``The opposition in the city went completely overboard with
their mud-slinging campaign against Iliescu,'' said Srboljub
Miskovic, editor of the local magazine.
   ``Unsubstantiated insults'' only provoked the public to rally in
defense of the party that steered the country to its first
multiparty elections in decades.
   ``They did themselves a disservice because the National Liberal
Party's political platform was essentially acceptable and Campeanu
is personally well liked and respected,'' Miskovic said.

   Police arrested 81 AIDS activists who were
demonstrating at the National Institutes of Health on Monday for
more government research on the disease.
   About 1,000 protestors chanted and shouted as they moved from
building to building on the NIH campus, draping red streamers
through the trees to symbolize the bureaucratic red tape they say
is slowing research.
   On the lawns in front of several buildings, they erected
cardboard headstones symbolizing the many lives lost to AIDS.
   ``We're just trying to get them to change the rules,'' said Mark
Harrington of the New York-based Aids Coalition to Unleash Power,
ACT UP, which organized the demonstration.
   Harrington said the activists want NIH to put more emphasis on
testing drugs that fight the opportunistic infections and cancers
that kill most AIDS patients, whose immune systems are weakened.
   They also want more research into anti-viral drugs that work
differently from AZT, currently the only approved drug that fights
the AIDS virus directly.
   The demonstrators say government researchers have focused too
much on AZT and its effectiveness in people with varying stages of
AIDS infection. The result, the activists say, is that studies on
other anti-viral drugs have not begun.
   In a statement to the media during the demonstration, NIH
officials rejected the criticism.
   The National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases,
which does most of the government's AIDS research, ``has conducted
or is preparing to conduct clinical trials of virtually all
promising anti-AIDS drugs and immune-enhancing agents,'' said Dr.
Anthony Fauci, director of the institute.
   William Raub, acting director of NIH, said that largely due to
the institutes' word, ``effective therapies are now slowing the
disease, prolonging lives and making a significant difference in
the quality of life of people with AIDS.''
   About 60 people were arrested on trespassing charges at the main
Bethesda campus, said Bob Schreiber, an NIH spokesman.
   At the nearby Rockville office of the director of AIDS Research
for the NIAID, 21 demonstrators were arrested on loitering charges,
Montgomery County police said.
   Police said the demonstrators had the option of paying a $50
fine or requesting a court date. All those arrested were freed,
authorities said.
   For years, AIDS activists focused their criticism on the Food
and Drug Administration, saying the agency moved too slowly in
approving new drugs to fight the disease.
   But they are shifting their focus to the researchers at NIH.
   ``Initially there was a bottleneck'' at the FDA, said Robert
Garcia of ACT UP. ``But as the epidemic has grown, we have had to
focus on what people are dying from, and those are the
opportunistic infections.''
   Harrington said the FDA ``can't approve drugs that aren't
there.''
   ``Now we're mad because approaches that are promising aren't
being pursued,'' he said.

White, chief assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
New York. She declined to disclose the nature of discussions
between her office and Brooklyn prosecutors.
   ``We're showing them everything we have,'' said a Brooklyn
prosecutor who spoke on condition on anonymity.
   Mondello, accused of leading the white mob that killed the youth
Aug. 23, was acquitted of murder and manslaughter on Friday, but
was convicted of riot and other lesser charges. Another defendant,
Joseph Fama, was convicted Thursday of murder and other charges.
   Meanwhile, the trial judge in the case ordered murder defendant
John Vento to be ready for trial in three weeks, rejecting a plea
by the defense lawyer for a delay. Vento and four other alleged
members of the gang of whites await trial on murder charges;
another man is charged with assault.
   Vento, 21, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder,
first-degree riot, first-degree assault and other crimes in the
slaying of Yusuf Hawkins. Prosecutors allege that Vento was part of
a mob of young whites who surrounded and shot Hawkins after he and
three friends went to the mostly white Bensonhurst neighborhood
shopping for a used car.
   Vento's lawyer, Gerald J. DiChiara, argued he needed additional
time to study more than 700 police reports given to him last week
and to prepare his client's defense.
   After the attack, Vento agreed to cooperate with the district
attorney's office in exchange for immunity from prosecution. He was
indicted in March after backing out of the deal, and is being held
without bail.

   A five-year-old program granting Peace Corps
volunteers scholarships to earn master's degrees in education while
teaching in urban schools will spread to 10 cities next fall, it
was announced Monday.
   Paul Coverdell, director of the Peace Corps, made the
announcement at Teachers College of Columbia University, which has
run the program for the past five years.
   Similar programs will start next fall in Los Angeles, Miami,
Philadelphia, Houston, San Antonio, San Diego and Atlanta,
Coverdell said. Two other cities will be named later.
   Under the plan, returning Peace Corps volunteers work in city
schools while studying for their master's degrees at a local
university. Eighty-five Peace Corps volunteers have taken part in
the program at Teachers College during its five-year history, and
35 more are scheduled to begin studies next fall.
   Volunteers in Los Angeles will be able to study at the
University of Southern California. In Miami, they will work toward
degrees at Florida International University. Planning is still
underway in the other cities.
   In New York, scholarships cover from one-third to three-fourths
of tuition depending on the field of study. The highest amounts go
to those majoring in math and science, while those studying special
education, bilingual education or English as a second language
usually get smaller awards.
   The New York City program operated on grants totaling $150,000
from the New York City Board of Education, Xerox Foundation, Chase
Manhattan Bank, Hebrew Technical Institute and several anonymous
benefactors.

   A member of the Cheyenne-Araphoe tribes has
been named founding director of the National Museum of the American
Indian, the Smithsonian Institution said Monday.
   W. Richard West Jr., an Albuquerque, N.M., lawyer, was chosen by
a search committee that began work in January, Smithsonian
Secretary Robert McC. Adams said at a news conference.
   The museum will be built in the last remaining space on the
Washington Mall, between the National Air and Space Museum and the
U.S. Capitol. Ground is expected to be broken in 1994.
   ``My highest aspiration for the National Museum of the American
Indian is that it will re-analyze, redirect and, in many cases,
reformulate entirely the concepts and presentations of the past
concerning Indian culture,'' West said.
   West, a partner in the Indian-owned law firm of Gover, Steton,
Williams &amp; West, has worked with the Native American Council of
Regents of the Institute of American Indian Arts. He is the son of
Indian artist Walter Richard West Sr.
   West, 47, said he would resign from the law firm. His
appointment is effective June 1 at a yearly salary of $115,000.

<TEXT>
   Students at Florida A&amp;M University, the
only predominantly black university in the state's nine-school
system, will be required to take a course in African-American
history starting next spring.
   The three-hour, one-semester course will be taken by freshmen
and sophomores, Eva Wanton, dean of general studies, said Monday.
   FAMU faculty and students have for several years supported such
a history requirement, and it was adopted this year during an
overall review of the core curriculum, Wanton said. The Faculty
Senate gave its approval May 8.
   Many black educators say humanities have long been taught in a
vacuum, and that a lack of knowledge about black contributions
breeds a lack of respect.
   FAMU professors concede that one course won't ensure a
pluralistic education, but say it's a first step.
   The university plans to hire additional faculty to help teach
the course.
   Eventually, Wanton said, FAMU professors hope to write a new
American history textbook in which black contributions would be
reported, and ``Hispanics and Native Americans would get their
due.''
   Last spring, the last term for which figures were available,
FAMU's student body included 6,424 blacks, 751 whites, 110
Hispanics, one American Indian, 53 Asian or Pacific students, and
130 non-resident immigrants.

<HEAD>Defense Ministers Urge Western Europe Nations to Pay More for
Defense</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West European countries must prepare to
pay more in common defense costs as the United States moves to
substantially reduce its military presence in Europe, defense
ministers said Monday.
   ``It is increasingly incumbent upon us, as Europeans, to assume
a greater responsibility for our defense,'' the ministers said in a
statement at the end of day-long talks at the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The United States' plans for a diminished role in Europe means
``we have to be prepared to take a major responsibility,'' said
Gerhard Stoltenberg, the West German defense minister.
   The United States has increasingly called for the prosperous
nations of Western Europe to pay more of the West's defense costs.
Members of the U.S. Congress have complained that Europeans are not
sharing a fair portion of the defense burden.
   West European officials are now talking about footing more of
the collective security bill because of the possibility of an arms
control accord between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Stoltenberg told reporters West Europeans must realize that the
United States will gain the ``major part of reductions'' in troops
and arms in a conventional arms agreement with the Soviet Union.
   Negotiators for NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact are in
Vienna, bargaining over reductions in tanks, troops, artillery and
other conventional forces in Europe. Western officials want to
reach an accord in the fall.
   An agreement could lead to the United States and the Soviet
Union reducing troop size in central Europe to 195,000 on each
side. The United States would maintain an additional 30,000 in
Britain and southern Europe.
   To meet the new levels, Moscow would have to pare 370,000
soldiers. The United States would have to trim 60,000 in central
Europe and 20,000 outside the region.
   The European officials, known as the Eurogroup, met a day before
a regularly scheduled meeting of NATO defense ministers. U.S.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will attend the meeting at the
alliance headquarters in Brussels.
   In a final statement, the Eurogroup ministers said NATO must
``adapt to the changing security environment,'' prompted by the
political upheavals in Eastern Europe.
   The ministers said the potential military threat from the Warsaw
Pact has been significantly reduced. It would decline further, they
said, with the reductions in soldiers and weapons expected under a
conventional arms treaty.
   But they cautioned that even after an arms accord, the Kremlin
``will retain substantial and modern nuclear and conventional
forces.''
   They said NATO remains vital for the security of Western Europe.
   They also welcomed the prospect of a united Germany and said
membership in NATO of the merged nation would further stabilize
Europe.
   West Germany is a member of NATO, and East Germany belongs to
the Warsaw Pact. Moscow has opposed Western demands for the joined
nation to be part of NATO.
   A dozen West European countries were represented at Monday's
talks. Iceland, which has no armed forces, attended as an observer.
France, which does not belong to NATO's joint military structure,
did not participate.

<HEAD>Last Days of School Year Filled with Shock Instead of Joy</HEAD>

   What should be the happy, hectic last
days before summer at Hickman County High School instead are filled
with shock and sorrow.
   Students' lives have been turned upside down by the killing of a
assistant principal, allegedly at the hands of a science teacher
trying to blow up the school.
   ``We should be crying tears of joy at graduation. We'll be
crying, but there will be no joy,'' senior Carol Wilson said Monday.
   ``We're all really upset,'' said another senior, Jeanine Harlowe.
   The science teacher, Donald Givens, 50, was ordered held without
bond Monday at his arraignment on charges of first-degree murder in
the shooting death of Ron Wallace, 41.
   Givens, described by school officials as troubled and fearful of
not being rehired in the fall, also was charged with aggravated
arson for allegedly setting fire to the school while someone was
inside.
   Investigators allege that Givens shot Wallace after the
assistant principal surprised him as he prepared to blow up the
school Sunday morning.
   Several of the 850 students at the rural school had complained
about Givens, but not about anything serious, said school district
Superintendent Wayne Qualls.
   The complaints ``were that he couldn't get along with the kids.
But not any real serious problems,'' Qualls said.
   Harlowe said Givens was ``very weird. But I would never have
believed he would do something like this.''
   Anthony Pharris, a recent graduate, also described Givens as
``weird. He'd be teaching a class and he'd just get lost.''
   Givens, who has taught in Hickman County for 16 years, may have
feared he was about to lose his tenured job, Qualls said.
   But while the teacher ``probably supposed things were stacked
against him,'' none of the student complaints had been brought
before the school board, Qualls said.
   The superintendent said Givens had personal problems, including
having to care for an invalid brother who was paralyzed in an
automobile accident.
   He also was responsible for taking care of the family farm and
his elderly parents, Qualls said.
   School officials decided Monday to proceed with the graduation
ceremony as scheduled on Friday, and set a rehearsal for Tuesday.
   ``We all agreed that's what Ron would want, for us to go ahead
and proceed in some form,'' said Principal Rick Brewer.
   The rest of the school year _ three days of final exams this
week _ was canceled. Teachers decided to give students grades of
100 for any unfinished work and average final grades from there.
   Wallace was shot in the head and chest with a .38-caliber
revolver. His body was discovered in the hall outside the science
department after firefighters responded to a fire call.
   Wallace had gone to the school, 40 miles southwest of Nashville,
Sunday morning to prepare a conference room for afternoon
baccalaureate services.
   Apparently, investigators said, he walked in on Givens as the
teacher was turning on propane gas taps in the science department,
where candles were burning.
   Givens was accused of setting, after the shooting, three
separate fires that caused approximately $150,000 in damage to the
school library, science department and auditorium, police said.
   Before he was arrested Sunday, Givens was at the school with
other teachers, surveying the damage to their classrooms.
   In addition to his assistant principal duties, Wallace was
girls' softball coach and had previously coached girls' basketball.
   His daughter, April, is one of 187 seniors scheduled to graduate
Friday. Some of her fellow students said the exercises should be
canceled out of respect.
   ``It would be too hard on April, sitting there thinking about
her daddy,'' said Wilson.

<HEAD>Biden Returns Bush Fire on Crime Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden on
Monday denied President Bush's accusations of congressional
foot-dragging on major crime legislation, saying the administration
should stop playing politics on the bill.
   ``If the administration wants to make this issue partisan, then
we will,'' Biden said as the Senate opened debate on a wide-ranging
package dealing with capital punishment and related issues.
   Biden, D-Del., said he was disturbed about recent statements
made by Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle charging that Congress
has given short-shrift to a crime package the president submitted a
year ago.
   ``We have heard ... a lot of rhetoric suggesting that the
president's crime bill has been languishing in the Senate since
last May and I think it's time to set the record straight,'' Biden
said.
   The Democratic and Republican leadership, with the concurrence
of the White House, agreed that the crime bill should be discussed
now, Biden said.
   Some elements of the Bush package already have been passed,
including the 1988 bill allowing the death penalty for murders
committed by drug kingpins, Biden said.
   Bush, in a Sunday speech to a law enforcement audience in
Portland, Ore., accused Congress of spawning ``weak imitations'' of
his proposals to attack crime after allowing them to languish for a
year.
   ``We must reject those who soft-pedal the need to be hard on
crime,'' Bush said.
   He accused lawmakers of sitting on key anti-crime proposals, but
acknowledged that Congress agreed to his request for more federal
law enforcement officers, prosecutors and prisons.
   Biden said in the Senate floor speech that Congress not only
passed key elements of the original Bush package, but that
lawmakers ``strengthened it, made it stronger.''
   On the difficult remaining issues such as capital punishment and
the length of time prisoners have for filing federal appeals, he
said, the administration seems to have no interest in negotiating.
   ``The time to play politics on this kind of issue is over,''
Biden said.
   ``If they don't want to talk, well, so be it. That's their
prerogative,'' he said. ``They are not interested in compromise, at
least it seems to me, and I hope it's not because they see more
political gain in conflict over ... cooperation.''
   Many of the Senate's Republicans are supporting a rival crime
bill introduced by Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina because of
its tougher death penalty provisions.
   Thurmond, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee,
told the Senate on Monday that he was concerned about an amendment
to the Democratic bill, introduced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., which would invalidate use of capital punishment in states
where it is applied disproportionately to blacks.
   Thurmond said no evidence had been produced to show that blacks
or other minorities are discriminated against in the application of
the death penalty.

<TEXT>
   Twelve generals have been executed for
leading an attempted coup against Ethiopian President Mengistu
Haile Mariam, Ethiopia's state radio reported Monday.
   The report said the men were sentenced to death Saturday after
being found guilty of trying to overthrow the government.
   ``The final verdict passed by the Supreme Court has been carried
out,'' said the broadcast monitored in Nairobi, Kenya.
   It did not say whether the men admitted the charges at the
trial, which was held in secret. It also did not say when or how
the men were killed.
   Soldiers found guilty of treason in Ethiopia normally face
firing squads.
   Addis Ababa Radio said a rear admiral also convicted was
sentenced to 15 years in jail and a major general was given 10
years in prison.
   War-weary generals discouraged by a succession of battlefield
defeats against rebels in northern Ethiopia tried to overthrow the
government last May, while Mengistu was on a trip to East Germany
to request arms.
   It is not known how many soldiers died in the fighting around
Addis Ababa, the capital. Those killed included Defense Minister
Maj.-Gen. Haile Giorgis Habte Mariam, who remained loyal to
Mengistu and was shot by mutinous forces.
   Heavy fighting also occurred in Eritrea, where some soldiers
supported the coup attempt.
   Many military leaders wanted Mengistu to negotiate with the
rebels. Since the coup attempt, he has begun talks, but they are
stalled.
   The rebels, like Mengistu, are Marxist-Leninists. Rebels in
Eritrea province want independence, while those in Tigre want
autonomy.
   Mengistu has ruled this Horn of Africa nation, strategically
located at the mouth of the Red Sea, since 1974 when he and a group
of young army officers ousted Emperor Haile Selassie.

<HEAD>New Evidence Casts Doubt on IRA Bomb Factory Convictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New evidence casts doubt on the convictions of
seven people accused of running an Irish Republican Army bomb
factory in the 1970s, the legal counsel for a judicial inquiry said
Monday.
   Tests that found traces of nitroglycerine on the hands of the
seven defendants were insufficient to sustain their convictions,
said David Clarke, in an opening statement to a judicial inquiry.
   The inquiry, conducted by Sir John May, has no power to reverse
the convictions. It may be a year before the inquiry makes its
recommendations to the government.
   British courts in the past 12 months have reversed the
convictions of four people accused of IRA bombings and three others
convicted of plotting to assassinate a British government official.
   Earlier this year, Home Secretary David Waddington ordered a
review of the convictions of six men for IRA bombings in Birmingham
that killed 21 people in 1974. That review has not been completed.
   No explosives were found in the possession of the seven
defendants currently under review, but they were convicted of
possessing explosives.
   Their convictions were based on tests and on statements made by
two men convicted of killing seven people in pub bombings in
Guildford and Woolwich in 1974.
   Those men and two others convicted of the pub bombings were
freed last year after prosecutors admitted that police lied about
statements made by the defendants.
   Following their release, May, a former Appeal Court judge, was
appointed to conduct an inquiry into the Guildford and Woolwich
case, and the related conviction in 1976 of four members of the
Maguire family, two relatives and a friend.
   The test used in the case, known as thin-layer chromatography,
or TLC, is a reliable test for nitroglycerine, Clarke said.
   ``In a nutshell, the results of the TLC tests, viewed now with
the benefit of hindsight, did not of themselves prove that there
had been in the house ... a bulk or quantity of explosive, which
had been handled by all the defendants,'' Clarke said.
   ``But they do suggest that there had been at least a secondary
source, that is to say a person who had been in contact with a
primary source. That person need not have been one of the
defendants.''
   Clarke said one of the defendants may have handled a glass or
towel previously touched by someone who had handled nitroglycerine.
   Convicted in the case were Patrick Maguire, his wife Anne, and
sons Vincent and Patrick; Guiseppe Conlon, husband of Patrick
Maguire's sister; Sean John Smyth, Mrs. Maguire's brother; and
family friend Patrick Joseph O'Neill.
   Conlon, whose son Gerard was convicted in the Guildford case,
died in prison; the others have completed their sentences.
   Police began investigating the Maguires after statements by Paul
Hill and later by Gerard Conlon identifying Anne Maguire as a bomb
maker. Hill and Conlon have said their statements were obtained
under duress.
   Clarke said it was impossible to regard any of the Maguire
convictions as ``safe,'' the standard used by the Court of Appeal
in reversing the Guildford convictions.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran Associated Press foreign
correspondent Spencer Moosa, one of the few journalists to have had
easy access to the late President Chiang Kai-shek, has died, his
family said Monday. He was 85.
   Born in Shanghai, Moosa was a correspondent in China and Taiwan
for 29 years, until his retirement in 1968.
   His daughter, Irene, said he was rushed to a hospital Friday and
died several hours later. Doctors attributed his death Friday to
heart and lung disease.
   A noted raconteur, Moosa worked for the British news agency
Reuters before joining The AP, traveling with Nationalist Chinese
forces to Canton, Nanking, Chengdu and Chungking.
   His friends in the Nationalist Chinese hierarchy included Chiang
Kai-shek, allowing him rare access to the Nationalist leader.
   In 1949, when Chiang and his retinue fled Chengdu to Taiwan to
escape the victorious Communist army, Moosa was on one of the last
planes reserved for Nationalist leaders leaving the Chinese
mainland.
   Earlier that year, Moosa had been taken into custody by
Communist troops in Beijing and accused of ``false reporting,''
although he accurately described a negotiated agreement for joint
Nationalist-Communist administration of Beijing as a ``surrender''
document.
   He and another journalist were vilified by the Communists as
``the claws and fangs of American imperialism,'' and students
threatened to lynch them until an unknown high-ranking official
intervened.
   In Taiwan, Moosa was the AP's chief correspondent until his
retirement, when he joined the Taiwan Tourism Bureau.
   In addition to his daughter Irene, Moosa is survived by another
daughter, Maya, and son, Alexander.
   Funeral services are scheduled Friday in Taipei.

   PLO officials urged Monday that U.N.
troops be sent to the Israeli-occupied territories to protect
residents, and one official vowed the organization ``will not be
silent'' following the murders of seven Palestinians.
   Abdallah Frangi, representative for the Palestine Liberation
Organization in Bonn, released a statement Monday calling for U.N.
troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Frangi also warned of retaliation for the slaying Sunday of
seven Palestinian laborers by an Israeli civilian. ``The whole
world should know _ we will not be silent. We will reply. We have
the power to reply.''
   Farouk Kaddoumi, foreign affairs chief of the PLO, said the
international community has a responsibility to protect
Palestinians in the occupied lands by using U.N. observers.
   ``Statements and verbal commitments are no longer sufficient.
The moment has come for concrete acts,'' said Kaddoumi. He spoke
while passing through Rome airport en route to the Arab summit in
Baghdad, scheduled for May 28.
   Frangi appealed to the European Economic Community to support
the proposals for U.N. deployment.
   He charged that silence by the United States and the EEC had
made Israeli officials ``feel encouraged'' in their current
policies.
   At least one EEC member, Italy, denounced Israel's handling of
the Palestinian protests that erupted after Sunday's slayings.
   The Foreign Ministry released a statement Monday saying the
recent unrest confirms that the situation in the occupied
territories is ``untenable.'' It urged Israel to ``welcome the
offer for a peace dialogue growing from the moderate turn in the
Palestinian movement.''
   Frangi said he fears Israel's continued presence in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip will spark a ``war of annihilation'' in the
Middle East during the next few years.
   ``I am more convinced today that in the near future we will not
be able to experience peace,'' said Frangi.
   ``And I would dare say that in the coming years there will be a
war of annihilation, and those to be held responsible will be
Israeli politicians,'' he said.
   Frangi said the PLO will wait for a decision on how to react to
the recent violence after the summit of Arab states.

   Security forces in Kashmir on Monday
opened fire on a crowd of 100,000 mourners carrying the body of a
slain Moslem leader, killing at least 41 people and wounding 300,
officials said.
   Earlier Monday an official source in New Delhi, speaking on
condition of anonymity, gave a different account of the shooting.
He said militants opened fire on paramilitary troops ``and in the
cross-fire approximately 20 people were killed and 40 were
wounded.''
   Witnesses and doctors in Srinagar said 30 bodies and at least
300 people with bullet wounds were brought to Soura hospital.
Official sources in Srinagar, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said 41 were killed in the firing.
   Witnesses said about 40 bodies were still on the streets of the
Hawal neighborhood of Srinagar where the shooting took place. The
city was under curfew and the reports could not be confirmed
immediately.
   Prior to Monday's killings, nearly 400 people had been killed in
Kashmir in clashes between security forces and Moslem militants.
The militants want the predominantly Moslem state to secede from
mostly Hindu India.
   A high-ranking U.S. government delegation arrived in New Delhi
late Sunday to talk with Indian leaders about the Kashmir crisis
that has inflamed tensions between India and Pakistan.
   Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates and John Kelly,
the assistant U.S. Secretary for Near East and South Asian affairs,
arrived from Pakistan where they met with senior officials.
   Gates and Kelly met Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh and urged
India and Pakistan to settle the issue with dialogue.
   On Monday, Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, was under curfew
following the assassination of Maulvi Mohammad Farooq, Kashmir's
top Islamic religious leader.
   But tens of thousands of mourners defied the curfew and streamed
to Soura hospital where they took Farooq's body and began marching
in a procession to his office, 6 miles away.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said members of
the paramiltary Central Reserve Police Force opened fire without
warning on the procession at about the 5-mile point.
   They said Farooq's coffin was hit with bullets and the body fell
out. Some of the mourners put the body, with fresh bullet wounds,
back into the coffin and ran with it into the narrow alleys to his
office.
   Foarooq's aides said a funeral date has not been set.
   Farooq, 45, was shot and fatally wounded in his office early
Monday by three unidentified gunmen, said his chief aide Mohammad
Maqbool.
   He said the youths were dressed in Western clothes and appeared
to be Kashmiris.
   Farooq suffered 15 bullet wounds to the head and body and later
died in Soura hospital, a doctor said.
   Before dying, Farooq blamed his assassination on the Hindu
fundamentalist group, Shiv Sena, or Shiva's Army, named for the
Hindu god of destruction, Farooq's private secretary Mohammad Yaqub
said.
   State government officials blamed the killing on Kashmiri
militants but several militant groups denied responsibility in
phone calls to local reporters and repeated announcements over
loudspeakers in mosques that the ``freedom fighters'' had no hand
in the slaying.
   Farooq had long urged a political settlement of the Kashmir
dispute but saw his importance in the troubled valley eclipsed by
Moslem militants.
   He denounced the Indian military deployment in the region and
joined the call for independence after the Jan. 20 crackdown.
   The violence in Kashmir has led to a deterioration of relations
between India and Pakistan.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the Moslem
militants. Pakistan denies the charge and accuses India of
violating human rights in a bid to quash what it says is a fight
for self-determination.
   The dispute began in 1947 when British colonial India gained
independence and was divided along religious lines into Pakistan
and India.
   Kashmir's Hindu ruler chose to merge his state with India
despite its Moslem majority. Pakistan objected to the move and the
dispute has led to two wars with India.

<HEAD>Government Approves Bacteria Treatment for Bladder Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday
approved use of a live but weakened bacteria to treat a type of
bladder cancer.
   The product, Bacillus Calmette Guerin Live, or BCG Live, was
approved to treat bladder cancer referred to as ``carcinoma in
situ.'' This type constitutes 20 to 30 percent of the 45,000 cases
of bladder cancer detected in the United States each year, the FDA
said.
   The treatment calls for the bacteria to be administered directly
to the bladder through a catheter to attack the cancer cells on the
lining of the organ. The inflammation that results eliminates many
of the cancer cells.
   Studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute found that 74
percent of patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder responded
to BCG treatment. Of those, the median time for recurrence of the
cancer was four years, the FDA said.
   The most common side effects of the treatment are flu-like
symptoms such as fever, chills and nausea and bladder discomfort.
   However, the FDA-approved labeling also warns physicians to
watch for spread of the BCG organism throughout the body. This, the
FDA said, has been associated with two deaths.
   Treatment with BCG is given once a week for six weeks and then
monthly for six to 12 months.
   The product is made by Connaught Laboratories Ltd. of
Willowdale, Ontario, Canada. It will be marketed under the trade
name Theracys.

<HEAD>Stuffed Animals Recalled Because of Choking Hazard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California company is voluntarily recalling
six models of stuffed animals imported from China because their
eyes can detach, posing a potentially fatal choking hazard, the
government said Monday.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said there have been no
known deaths or injuries caused by the toys, all of which contain
music boxes and are distributed by the San Francisco Music Box Co.
   The six toys have eyes with washers on the back and the company
discovered defective washers that allow the eyes to become
detached, posing the choking hazard, the CSPC said.
   The CSPC, in a statement, said the six toys have wind-up keys
protruding from their backs and a small white tag sewed to the side
or bottom that reads: ``The San Francisco Music Box Company,
Emeryville, Ca., Reg. No. PA-2642 (RC) All New Materials Made In
China.''
   Approximately 2,866 of the stuffed animals were distributed
nationwide from December 1988 through June 1989, the CSPC said.
Consumers should return the animals to the retail outlet from which
they were purchased for a full refund. Additional questions can be
directed to the company by calling the toll free number,
1-800-227-2190.
   The names of the animals, their model numbers and the song
played by the music box are:
   _White Jointed Bear, 55-0046, ``You Are My Sunshine.''
   _Beige Jointed Bear, 55-0061, ``Don't Let Me Go.''
   _Beige Small Jointed Bear, 55-0038, ``It's A Small World.''
   _Pink Bear, 55-0079, ``A Baby's Lullabye.''
   _Pink Monkey, 55-0095, ``Zip-a-dee-doo-daa.''
   _Beige Articulated Santa Bear, 55-0368.

<HEAD>Observers Clash Over Whether Romanian Election Free or Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interim President Ion Iliescu captured
87 percent of the 6.7 million votes counted so far, but foreign
observers clashed Monday over whether Romania's first multiparty
election in 53 years was free of fraud. The main opposition parties
charged results of Sunday's balloting were rigged, called Romania's
first attempt at democratic voting a failure, and said they would
contest the elections in court.
   Ion Ratiu, the National Peasants' Party's presidential
candidate, said he would take legal action to have the election
declared ``null and void.''
   He vowed to fight ``against the renewal of Communism in
Romania,'' which he said Iliescu represents.
   Iliescu, 60, came to power in the December revolution against
Nicolae Ceausescu and was the heavy pre-election favorite. He drew
huge campaign crowds, especially in the countryside where he was
seen as the man who saved Romania from the Communist dictator.
   The campaign occasionally turned violent, but no major incidents
were reported Sunday.
   First official results published by the state news agency
Rompres suggested an overwhelming win for Iliescu.
   Most official results were not expected until Wednesday because
of the heavy turnout, estimated at more than 85 percent of the 16
million eligible voters, and the complicated ballot, which
contained more than 30 pages.
   The dispute among the 500 foreign observers who fanned out
across the country to watch the voting centered on whether a series
of irregularities added up to acceptable or unacceptable election
violations.
   Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers, R-N.M., the official U.S. government
observer, called the poll ``a good election'' and ``a very giant
step toward democracy.''
   Austrian parliamentarian Andreas Khol, general secretary of the
European Democratic Union, disagreed, saying: ``These were a big
step toward free and democratic elections, but they were not free
and not democratic elections.''
   Carruthers asked the Romanian government to set up mechanism to
investigate allegations of fraud and irregularities during the
campaign and voting.
   Prime Minister Petre Roman, a prominent member of Iliescu's
governing National Salvation Front, said later the Central
Electoral Bureau had set up a commission to investigate alleged
improprieties.
   ``Already some fraud was discovered,'' he told The Associated
Press, citing as an example what he said were 25 ballots
pre-stamped for the National Liberals' candidate, Radu Campeanu.
   Rompres said that with 6.7 million votes counted, Iliescu had 87
percent; Campeanu 10 percent, and Ratiu, 3 percent.
   Its vote report also had the Front winning nearly two-thirds of
the seats in Parliament so far.
   A onetime Communist official who opposed Ceausescu in 1971,
Iliescu gained sympathy for being demoted and was far better known
and popular than either Campeanu or Ratiu, who spent decades in
exile.
   Iliescu won wide support from peasants by permitting them to own
large plots of land. Industrial workers, about 40 percent of
Romania's labor force, liked his pledges to move slowly in
transforming Romania's state-controlled economy to a capitalist
free market.
   His apparent triumph and the strong showing for the Front
suggested that anti-Communist demonstrators who blocked a main
square in Bucharest for a 30th day Monday and protesters in other
cities enjoyed little broad popular support.
   Iliescu and the Front look like becoming the first ex-Communists
in Eastern Europe to triumph in the region's current series of
multiparty elections.
   Initial Rompres results for the two-chamber Parliament gave the
Front about 65 percent; Liberals, 7 percent; Peasants, 3 percent;
and ecologists 3 percent.
   The Hungarian Democratic Union, representing Romania's 2 million
Hungarian minority, had about 7 to 8 percent. The other votes went
to tiny parties.
   Ratiu, who attended Carruthers' news conference, said the
governor's upbeat assessment would completely mislead Americans and
President Bush.
   Calling the election a fraud, Ratiu said, ``There was no
semblance of democracy about it.''
   ``We will contest the election if this is the sort of result
that we get,'' he said, pledging to demand new elections.
   The various observer groups reported instances of ballots
pre-stamped for Iliescu, Front members accompanying elderly voters
into the booth, non-registered voters casting ballots, and
individuals voting several times.
   Many observer complaints focused on the campaign rather than the
voting itself. Several alleged that the Front, which dominated the
interim government, unfairly controlled the election apparatus and
the electronic media.
   Carruthers and other observers urged the West and the new
Romanian government to work to create a free press as a guarantee
of future democracy.
   ``The process was flawed. But the very fact that an election has
taken place is itself a remarkable achievement,'' said a 60-member
delegation sponsored by the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties.
   ``One could not say there was organized fraud,'' said Andre
Billardon, vice president of the French National Assembly and a
member of its observer group.
   The United States has said future U.S-Romanian relations, and
U.S. trade concessions important to Romania's shattered economy,
are conditional on whether the elections were ``fully free and
fair.''

<HEAD>House Takes Up Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House began debate Monday over the first
strengthening of clean air laws in 13 years, while closed-door
negotiations appeared unlikely to head off a floor fight over a
tougher smog-control proposal.
   The House was expected to vote on a series of about a half-dozen
amendments to the bill later in the week, with a final vote on the
legislation expected by Thursday.
   The Senate already has approved a clean air bill.
   The legislation before the House won overwhelming approval from
the Energy and Commerce Committee in April. Its major provisions _
including major cuts in acid rain pollutants, reduction in smog
causing auto emissions and controls on toxic industrial releases _
are unlikely to be changed dramatically during floor action.
   The legislation's cost to the economy because of new
pollution-control requirements has been put at about $21 billion a
year when all its provisions go into effect.
   As floor debate began on the bill, key congressmen and staff
aides worked to reach compromise agreements on about a half-dozen
amendments, with an aim toward avoiding as many contentuous floor
battles as possible.
   But parties to the discussions said a floor fight has become
almost unavoidable on a proposed amendment by Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., that calls for the annual production of 1 million
non-gasoline powered automobiles for sale in the nine U.S. cities
with the highest air pollution.
   The cities are Los Angeles, San Diego, Houston, Chicago,
Milwaukee, Baltimore, New York, Philadelphia and Hartford, Conn.
   The measure would make the bill's smog-controlling auto emission
requiring significantly tougher than the Senate version, which has
no production requirement.
   The auto industry has launched an all-out campaign to block the
proposal, arguing that it would require manufacturers to rush such
cars into production without clear evidence there would be a market
for them.
   Waxman, speaking on the House floor, characterized his proposal
as nothing more than what President Bush had sought nearly a year
ago when he included as part of his clean air proposal a
requirement for alternative-fuel vehicles.
   But the White House backed away from imposing a production
requirement after intense lobbying from the auto industry.
   The Senate defeated efforts to impose a similar requirement as
did Waxman's own Energy and Commerce subcommittee. Both
environmentalists and auto industry lobbyists predicted a close
vote on the amendment when it comes to the House floor.
   In opening remarks in the floor debate, Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman who has long
been protective of the auto industry's interests, suggested that
most controversies on the clean air legislation ``have been largely
eliminated.''
   Dingell characterized the remaining issues of disagreement, as
being ``not environmental in character, but rather differences of
views'' among congressmen.
   Meanwhile, compromise agreements were reported Monday to have
been worked out on several amendments, assuring their swift
approval when brought to the floor. These included:
   _A requirement to sell in the nine cities with the worst smog
problem a cleaner gasoline blend that has a specific oxygen
content, allowing it to burn cleaner. The oil industry vigorously
opposed the measure, calling it tilted toward the use of ethenol,
which comes from grain.
   _Require the Environmental Protection Agency within two years to
develop regulations on regional haze near major federal parks and
wilderness areas. Environmentalists have claimed the EPA has been
slow in curbing air pollution in such areas.
   _Streamline some provisions of the permitting and enforcement
section of the bill to ease the paperwork burden to some businesses.
   Other amendments likely to be taken up on the House floor
include a provision broading the required phaseout of a variety of
atmospheric ozone-damaging chemicals in addition to
chloroflurocarbons, or CFCs, and an amendment that would impose
federal air pollution requirements on offshore oil-drilling
platforms.

   One thing distinguishes Regina Liska
from the 11 other candidates for president in the May 27 elections.
She's a witch.
   She also is the only candidate making some alarming predictions.
   The 58-year-old woman says a nuclear accident in Brazil will
kill many people, and a U.S. city will be wiped out.
   Known as Regina 11, she also is the only candidate married to an
American. Her husband is Danny Liska, of Niobrara, Neb., a
motorcycle enthusiast who cruised into town and married her in 1968.
   With Regina's broom, her official symbol, and Liska's
motorcycle, the pair have ridden to fame.
   They operate out of a huge, three-story building where there are
some rather strange goings-on. In one huge room recently, a dozen
people holding hands in a circle swayed and moaned while an elderly
man sat in a chair.
   No one would say what it was all about.
   There is a book store, a shop offering metaphysical
paraphernalia and a shop where disciples' yellow, graduation type
gowns are made on sewing machines.
   Each night, scores of people, sometimes as many as 300, gather
around a large wooden platform to hear Regina 11. She makes
predictions and talks about spirits, curing people, abstaining from
liquor and cigarettes and voting for her next Sunday.
   This is the second time she has run for president. The first
time, in 1986, she received 74,000 votes. She had 860,000 but was
cheated of victory by fraud, she said in an interview at her
headquarters.
   Predictions for the coming year?
   _An earthquake will destroy vast parts of northern Mexico and
southern California.
   _A city in the United States will be wiped out by an illness
that will be caused by an ashlike material falling from the sky.
Ash from a volcano? Radioactive dust from a nuclear bomb? She does
not know.
   _An earthquake in Nicaragua will kill thousands.
   _Nuclear weapons will explode in Brazil. There will be a plague
across the land. An earthquake and fires will devastate a Brazilian
city, perhaps Rio de Janeiro.
   _An earthquake in China will kill 4 million people.
   Regina 11 says she has had the power to cure and to see the
future since she was four years old.
   Her body floated in her room then, and a face appeared in a
vision. A voice said she would ``know the world'' through the
number 11. Hence, she calls herself Regina 11.
   She says she has already predicted to her disciples several
major tragedies and assassinations in Colombia. She said the
visions started seven years ago.
   She has had no visions on whether she will win Sunday's election.
   Regina 11 had enough votes from the last election to warrant the
government treating her as a serious contender this time. She, like
the other candidates, has received free television and radio time.
   Her campaign has only one theme: peace without weapons.

<HEAD>Government Cites Kentucky Mine Operator for 121 Safety Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of a Kentucky mine where 10
workers died in an explosion last year was cited Monday for 121
alleged violations of federal safety laws.
   The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration
said 42 violations against Pyro Mining Co. involved ``reckless
disregard'' of safety, the highest degree of negligence in the
agency's penalty system.
   The number and nature of the violations show ``a lack of concern
about safety on the part of the operator as well as poor safety
management,'' said William Tattersall, assistant secretary of labor
for mine safety and health.
   James Greenlee, executive vice president of Costain Coal, Inc.,
which owns Pyro, said the company was reviewing the alleged
violations to determine whether it will request a conference with
federal investigators to give them more information about safety
procedures.
   Companies are allowed to provide additional information before
the agency proposes fines for alleged safety violations.
Eventually, Pyro Mining could face civil penalties of up to $10,000
for each violation.
   An agency report earlier this month said 10 specific violations
contributed to the Sept. 13 explosion in Wheatcroft, Ky. Most of
the violations identified Monday had nothing to do with the cause
of the blast, but ``we still consider them serious,'' Tattersall
said.
   The agency report released May 8 said an investigation showed
that Pyro Mining managers knew explosive methane gas was
accumulating in the mine four days before the explosion, but they
did not maintain adequate records that would have alerted the
others.
   That report alleged that managers failed to make required checks
for the deadly gas in the hours before the explosion, failed to
keep enough clean air in the mine to clear out methane and made a
series of changes in air pathways that caused a methane buildup the
day of the disaster.
   Federal investigators were unable to determine exactly what
triggered the explosion.
   Monday's announcement said investigators looking for possible
ignition sources found 65 electrical violations in cables and
circuits. One electrical cable had 36 splices, all of which had
been improperly made, Tattersall said.
   Investigators also found 41 violations concerning ventilation
and pre-shift safety examinations. Another 15 citations involved
miscellaneous safety violatings, including blasting caps
haphazardly left in the work area.

   President Bush said Monday the federal
government ought to strike a ``needed balance'' between
environmental priorities and economic concerns.
   Addressing a controversial proposal to protect the northern
spotted owl, the president told a Republican fund-raising breakfast
that he rejects environmentalists who ``ignore the economic
consequences'' of protecting such fragile species.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is to decide June 23 whether
to add the owl to the endangered species list. Such a decision
would require federal agencies to protect the owl's habitat, the
Northwest's old-growth forests.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of
Land Management said such a decision would cut timber harvests from
federal lands nearly in half over the next five years, producing a
net loss of about 13,000 jobs in Oregon, Washington and northern
California.
   Bush said that he is concerned ``about preserving and protecting
our environment'' but that he rejects ``those who would ignore the
economic consequences of the spotted owl decision. The jobs of many
thousands of Oregonians and whole communities are at stake.'
   He told the breakfast, held to raise money for GOP gubernatorial
candidate Dave Frohnmayer, ``Common sense tells us to find a needed
balance.''
   ``It's going to take a lot of work to protect this great planet
and its wildlife without throwing hard-working citizens out of a
job,'' the president said, telling his audience he disagrees with
those ``who do not recognize their obligation to protect our
delicate ecosystem.''
   Referring to other contentious environmental issues, Bush said,
``I want Congress to pass a bill that will sharply cut acid rain,
smog and toxic pollutants. But Congress has got to respect another
kind of delicate ecology _ that of jobs and opportunity.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked after Bush's
speech if the administration was considering proposing changes in
the Endangered Species Act, said, ``There has been no consideration
of it.''
   Earlier this month, however, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
said the law was ``just too tough'' and added, ``We've got to
change it.''
   Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore., said Bush has agreed to schedule a
White House meeting with a group of Oregon residents to discuss a
long-term solution to the Northwest's timber-supply problem.
   ``This meeting will give Oregonians living in rural communities
the chance to tell their side of the story,'' Smith said. ``Their
jobs and way of life are on the line, and yet all we've been
hearing about is how we need to protect the spotted owl.''
   National Wildlife Federation President Jay D. Hair said,
meanwhile, that ``if President Bush is truly committed to
protecting both Oregon jobs and the environment, he should
recognize that the problems of an ailing timber industry predate
concerns over owls or ancient forests. Resorting to scapegoating
the owl for political gain does nothing to achieve balance.''
   Bush also said he wants Congress to move on his proposals to
block drug smugglers, fund more border agents and give them more
enforcement authority, as well as the power to order suspected
drug-smuggling planes to land.
   ``To those who ask if our measures are too harsh, I say that the
threat to many Americans, especially those living in the
inner-city, is too great,'' he said.
   About 150 to 200 people demonstrated outside the hotel where
Bush spoke, burning American flags and newspapers and setting off
smoke bombs. Police arrested 27.
   The demonstrators appeared to be mostly of college age and
represent many groups, including peace activists, pro-choice
demonstrators, environmentalists and gay rights advocates.
   Frohnmayer is seeking to replace Democratic Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt, who is retiring.
   From Portland, Bush travelled to Los Angeles and sat in on a
meeting of anti-drug activists in a private home in the Oakwood
district of Venice.
   He praised the community for banding together to drive out drug
dealers, who had once overrun the neighborhood.
   ``Working with police, they decided to reclaim their streets, to
reclaim their children, to reclaim their future. And they are
succeeding,'' Bush told a gathering outside the house.
   The president delivered a plaque to community leaders naming the
Oakwood Community Beautification Committee as a daily ``point of
light.'' Bush issues the award every day to individuals or
organizations that exemplify his ``thousand points of light'' theme
of volunteerism.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Lawmakers Urges P&amp;G to Reconsider Boston Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four members of the Massachusetts
congressional delegation urged Procter &amp; Gamble on Monday to resume
advertising on two TV stations that aired spots critical of P&amp;G's
purchase of coffee from El Salvador.
   A letter signed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Reps. Edward
Markey, Joseph P. Kennedy II and Joseph Moakley, all Democrats,
said P&amp;G's decision to pull ads from a station in Boston and
another in Worcester, Mass., set a dangerous precedent.
   The company, the nation's largest advertiser of packaged
products, pulled ads in response to a 30-second commercial that
called for a boycott of Folgers Coffee.
   The commercials were produced by Neighbor to Neighbor, a
political advocacy group that favors a boycott of Folgers as a way
of influencing U.S. foreign policy toward El Salvador. A portion of
the coffee that goes into Folgers comes from El Salvador.
   ``We are alarmed that your company's decision to suspend
advertising on the two stations, simply for disagreeing with the
content of another paid advertisement broadcast over those
stations, is an extremely harmful precedent,'' the legislators
wrote.
   ``Our concern is that television stations might fall victim to
intimidation from a large advertiser out of fear of economic
retribution for airing paid commercials from smaller advertisers,''
the letter said. ``Such economic intimidation comes very close to
an effective corporate censorship over advertising content.''
   The letter was addressed to Edwin L. Artzt, chief exectutive
officer of Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble.
   A spokeswoman for Procter &amp; Gamble did not immediately return a
phone call seeking comment.

<HEAD>South and North Yemen Expected to Merge on Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALEM BAALAWI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ADEN, South Yemen (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Yemen's pro-Western parliament on
Monday approved a plan by President Ali Abdullah Saleh to merge
Tuesday with socialist South Yemen, official radio reports in North
Yemen said.
   The reports said the 159-member Shura Council, or parliament,
had ``agreed with a sweeping majority'' to merge the two Yemens,
which are among the world's least developed states. San`a, the
North Yemeni capital, is to serve as capital of the newly named
Yemen Republic.
   South Yemen's parliament, the Supreme People's Council, also
held a special session to approve the unification of the two Red
Sea nations.
   A united Yemen would be the second such union between two Arab
states in this century. In the 1950s, Egypt and Syria joined as the
United Arab Republic, but the merger collapsed after three years
because of internal squabbling.
   The new state would bind together 11 million people _ nine
million from the north and two million from the south.
   South Yemen was the Arab world's only avowedly Marxist state
after it gained independence from Britain in 1971.
   But Yemen began to reform as democratic changes swept through
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   The two Yemens are poor and undeveloped; labor unrest in South
Yemen has been aggravated in recent months as Western goods were
transported from North Yemen to the south.
   Strikes mushroomed in most government offices and factories in
South Yemen.
   The merger bid has been outwardly promoted by oil-rich nations
on the Arabian Peninsula such as Saudi Arabia, which is eager to
snuff out Soviet influence.
   Scores of Cuban and East German military experts are said to
have left Aden, the capital of South Yemen in recent months. A
friendship pact entitles the Soviets to maintain as many as 18,000
troops in the port city, but the extent of their deployment is
unknown.
   The merger was originally planned for Nov. 30, but it was moved
up to May 26. In recent days there had been pressure to speed up
the schedule even more so the two Yemens can attend an emergency
Arab summit on May 28 in Baghdad, Iraq, as one state.
   Shortly after the start of the session of South Yemen's
111-member Supreme People's Council, television announced that
Foreign Minister Abdul-Aziz al-Dali had suggested Tuesday as the
merger date.
   North Yemen's president then said he, too, expected a merger at
noon Tuesday, when the new flag of the Yemen Republic would be
raised.
   The flag is similar to the black, white and red one of North
Yemen, but without the stars.
   North Yemen's lawmakers were to travel to Aden for a joint
parliamentary session to proclaim the merger.
   A draft agreement on unification was agreed to by leaders of
both nations on April 22 in the city of Taiz, halfway between Aden
and North Yemen's capital of San`a.
   A planned transition period of 2{ years coincides with the
remainder of the five-year terms for both legislatures.
   North Yemen's president is expected to be elected as head of a
five-member presidential council.

   ``Wild At Heart,'' a bloody, sexually
explicit black comedy by American director David Lynch, won the
Golden Palm award Monday night as the best film at the 43rd Cannes
Film Festival.
   The host country's favorite, French box-office idol Gerard
Depardieu, was honored as best actor for his title role in ``Cyrano
de Bergerac,'' a lavish costume drama.
   Krystyna Janda of Poland won the best actress award for her
portrayal of an innocent, apolitical woman who accidentally is
sucked into the Kafkaesque prison system because a man she knew was
a suspect in ``The Interrogation,'' by Polish director Ryszard
Bugajski.
   The 1980 movie by Bugajski was banned from Polish theaters until
the pro-democratic reforms last year. The film was a favorite with
the Solidarity underground on videotape.
   The best director award went to Pavel Lunghin of the Soviet
Union for his first film, ``Taxi Blues,'' a look at the seamy side
of glasnost.
   Another Soviet director, Gleb Panfilov, was honored for best
artistic contribution for ``The Mother,'' the story of a woman's
anguish as her son becomes radicalized by the family's harsh life
under czarist rule and is tried for subversion.
   Lynch, 43, became the second American in a row to win the Golden
Palm, following Steven Soderbergh, the 1989 winner for ``sex, lies
and videotape.''
   ``I've been trying to get to the Cannes Film Festival for 20
years,'' Lynch told a celebrity-filled audience. ``It's a dream
come true.''
   Known for the bizarre nature of such films as ``Eraserhead'' and
``Blue Velvet,'' Lynch introduced himself in his movie's program at
Cannes as ``an Eagle Scout from Missoula, Mont.''
   His other work includes the current American television series
``Twin Peaks.''
   ``Wild At Heart'' portrays a love affair between Sailor Ripley,
who commits manslaughter in self-defense, and Lula Pace Fortune.
   The film becomes a chase, as the young couple _ played by
Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern _ is pursued through the deep South
and Texas by a variety of antagonists. There is close-up gore,
explicit love scenes and frequent flashes of humorous fantasy.
   Janda, 38, has worked with several of Poland's top directors but
until Monday was little-known abroad. In ``The Interrogation,'' she
is constantly on screen, moving audiences with a harrowing
portrayal of a victim of repression.
   Depardieu, 41, is a veteran of 60 films and has received
unanimous raves from French critics for his portrayal of Cyrano,
the long-nosed, lovelorn cavalier of Edmond Rostand's famous play.
   The Jury's Grand Prize, traditionally a sort of runner-up award,
went to two films from other continents _ ``Sting of Death'' by
Kohei Oguri of Japan and ``Tilai'' by Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina
Faso.
   The First Jury Prize went to ``Hidden Agenda,'' a controversial
film by Briton Ken Loach depicting British government attempts to
cover up human rights abuses by security forces in Northern Ireland.
   The Grand Prize for technical achievement was awarded to Pierre
Lhomme, director of photography for ``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   Several films not in the running for the Golden Palm were
honored by the 10-member jury. These included ``Don't Move, Die or
Come Back to Life,'' by first-time Soviet director Vitali Kanevski,
and ``The Lunch Date,'' by American Adam Davidson, selected as best
short film.

<HEAD>Stepped-Up Warnings Called For</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panels of medical experts on Monday
recommended stronger efforts to ensure that the acne drug Accutane
is not taken during pregnancy because it can cause birth defects.
   But the two Food and Drug Administration advisory committees
rejected the advice of some within the agency who want Accutane
withheld from all women to eliminate any risk of birth defects from
the drug.
   The manufacturer, Hoffman-LaRoche, said it was pleased with the
recommendations, which it said were close to additional warnings it
announced earlier in the day.
   Accutane, which has been on the market since 1982, is the best
treatment for severe recalcitrant cystic acne, a disfiguring and
debilitating form of acne. But a woman who takes the drug during
pregnancy has a 1-in-4 chance of having a baby with serious birth
defects.
   The committee actions came as other physicians were reporting
that Accutane can significantly block the growth of new tumors in
people being treated for smoking-related cancer of the mouth and
throat.
   In September 1988, Roche Dermatologics, a division of
Hoffman-LaRoche, began a pregnancy prevention program aimed at
emphasizing and educating physicians about the importance of
avoiding pregancy during treatment.
   Roche officials say 86 cases of birth defects have been reported
to the company as being associated with Accutane since the drug was
first marketed.
   But David Graham, an FDA medical epidemiologist, said that
number represents only about 10 percent of the number that actually
occur. He estimated that since 1982, nearly 1,000 babies have been
born with birth defects because their mothers were using Accutane.
   Graham also estimated that about 90 percent of the women using
Accutane do not have the severe form of acne for which the drug is
indicated.
   Accutane was prescribed last year for about 65,000 women of
child-bearing age. But the estimated annual incidence of severe
recalcitrant cystic acne in this group of women is less than 4,000,
Graham said.
   The overprescribing exposes tens of thousands of women to the
possibility of a malformed child if they become pregnant while
being treated, he said. It also increases the likelihood of
abortion, he said.
   Citing a Michigan Medicaid study, he said women using Accutane
had twice as many abortions as women not using the drug.
   He said Roche's pregnancy prevention program ``has failed to
achieve its objective.''
   ``The only way to eliminate exposure is to eliminate use of this
(drug) by women,'' he said.
   Robert Armstrong, director of medical affairs for Roche
Dermatologics, said Graham's estimates were based on shaky
assumptions.
   He also said that no one is sure how many women have the severe
acne. But he said he was sure the number of congenital
malformations that result from Accutane are not as large as Graham
believes.
   ``If there were that many out there, they would be noticed and
reported,'' Armstrong said.
   The FDA's advisory committees on dermatologic drugs and
fertility and maternal health drugs recommended by general
consensus that the company emphasize in its program the importance
of a pregnancy test before a patient starts using Accutane.
   The panels also recommended a program for patients to return any
unused Accutane at the end of treatment and that forms to record
patient consent, now available in English and Spanish, be available
in more languages. Additionally, the panels said physicians should
be encouraged to refer Accutane patients for contraception
counseling.
   Roche announced earlier in the day it was supplementing its
pregnancy prevention program to stress the importance of the first
pregnancy test, which Roche will offer to pay for _ and which must
show no pregnancy before therapy can begin.
   Other new measures include stepped-up advertising aimed at
physicians, possible development of a special prescription pad to
reinforce the warnings, provision of an illustration of a deformed
infant in the package literature and development of a method to
return unused Accutane.

   A Palestinian with a dagger and pistol
boarded a bus carrying French tourists Monday and shot or stabbed
10 people, wounding at least one critically, police said. They said
he acted to avenge a massacre in Israel.
   On Monday night, police fought thousands of demonstrators
marching toward the U.S. Embassy to vent their fury over Sunday's
killings of seven Palestinian laborers in Israel and subsequent
violence on the West Bank and Gaza strip.
   Several police were injured, at least two demonstrators arrested
and dozens of shop windows shattered, but no serious casualties
were reported.
   The slayings set off protests in Jordan's Palestinian refugee
camps.
   Jordanian authorities said nine tourists and a Jordanian tour
photographer were wounded Monday in the bus rampage by Ahmad
Badwan, 28, a Palestinian from the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip who
carried a temporary Jordanian passport and lived in Amman.
   ``The motive behind the Amman shooting incident was to avenge
the killing of Palestinian laborers in a Tel Aviv suburb Sunday,''
a police spokesman said but refused to elaborate.
   Israeli police said the Israeli who shot seven Palestinians to
death and wounded others was deranged. The shootings led to violent
demonstrations in Israel's occupied territories in which more
deaths and injuries occurred.
   On Monday morning, the Palestinian gunman got on the bus with 30
tourists aboard while it was parked near a popular tourist attract,
the Roman amphitheater in downtown Amman. He ``threatened to shoot
if anybody moved,'' said a police official, who cannot be named
under standing regulations.
   ``The tourists were scared and many started shouting, which
pushed the gunman to fire in all directions from a 7mm pistol,'' he
said.
   An Interior Ministry announcement said the man fired until he
ran out of ammunition, then stabbed two tourists with a dagger
before surrendering to police.
   Police arrested the attacker amid pandemonium. Pedestrians and
shopkeepers fled in panic when the gunshots rang out.
   Five tourists were treated at Bashir Hospital and released. Five
other victims were transferred to Hussein Medical Center for
further treatment.
   The hospital said 55-year-old Andre Pierro of Paris was in
critical condition with gunshot wounds in his left arm and right
thigh and a stab wound in the stomach.
   French Ambassador Denis Bauchard said Christian Legendre, 62, of
Paris, was shot in the left side of the chest and also was in
critical condition.
   Jordanian Marwan Al-Baba, 30, was shot in both palms. He was a
photographer for the Jordanian agency that handled the tourist
group.
   French President Francois Mitterrand called the hospital to
inquire about the victims, Jordanian officials said.
   King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan visited the wounded.
   Jordanian police said they were tightening security for foreign
tourists. They said police cars would escort the estimated three
dozen tour buses visiting Jordanian sites.
   Hussein said in a TV address he was surprised that the attack
``took place in our hospitable nation. ... It is probably related
to a feeling of anger ... toward Israel and its crimes, especially
for what happened yesterday.''
   But he said the violence in Israel was ``not an enough excuse at
all for what happened in Amman today.''
   The demonstration was brewing in the streets as the king spoke.
   The protesters appeared a mix of Moslem fundamentalists and
Palestinian nationalists.
   Some waved the the Koran, Islam's holy book, and shouted,
``Allahu akhbar!'' (God is great). Others waved black or
Palestinian flags and yelled ``The U.S. is the head of the snake!''
_ referring to Israel.
   They hurled rocks at police on the roads leading toward the
embassy, wounding several.
   Police used tear gas and billy clubs trying in vain to divert
the demonstrators from the mixed residential and business area
around the embassy.
   The police and army deployed a huge force to seal off the street
outside the U.S. Embassy, where 30 riot police linked arms at each
of 10 roadblocks.
   Frustrated demonstrators broke shop windows and traffic lights
and rolled garbage cans into the street.
   At least 20,000 Palestinian residents of the Baqaa Refugee Camp,
17 miles northwest of Amman, demonstrated on Monday to protest the
killings in Israel.
   They rolled burning tires onto the Amman-to-Damascus highway,
closing it for more than four hours. Police fired tear gas inside
the camp when the demonstrators started to march toward Amman.
   Roughly half of Jordan's 3.1 million people come from
Palestinian families who fled or were forced from their homeland
during the 1948 and the 1967 Arab-Israeli wars.

   Morning thunderstorms continued to drift to the south and east.
By afternoon storms extended from central Louisiana across
Mississippi, central and western Alabama, and parts of Tennessee,
Kentucky, Indiana, Illionis and Missouri, and along the Georgia and
South Carolina coasts.
   Severe thunderstorm watches were issued for parts of central and
southern Mississippi, eastern Louisiana, southern and central

   Hail up to an inch in diameter fell at Montgomery, Ala., and
Brookhaven, Louisville and Philadelphia, Miss. Gusty winds caused
minor damage in Sheffield, Ala., and a half-dozen Mississippi towns.
   Rain wasn't limited to the Southeast. Northwestern New York,
most of New England, Maryland and Delaware, and the northern half
of the Pacific Coast also had thunderstorms.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.35 inches at Columbus, Miss., and .86 inch at Monroe, La.

<HEAD>Aylwin Vows Justice in Rights Cases in State of Nation Address</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALPARAISO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin said Monday
in his first state of the nation address that he will seek ``truth
and justice'' in investigating human rights abuses under the past
military regime.
   ``We know that many cruel and painful things have occurred,
leaving as a result not only suffering but also anger among many of
our compatriots,'' he said.
   ``Ignoring those events would mean worsening that suffering and
allowing that anger to turn into irrational expressions of hatred
and violence,'' the 71-year-old president added.
   Aylwin spoke before a joint session of the two-chamber congress
in this port city 75 miles northwest of Santiago. The nation's top
military and civilian leaders attended the address.
   But Aylwin's predecessor, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, was absent from
the assembly. Pinochet ruled for 16{ years until March 11 and was
condemned by international organizations for widespread rights
abuses.
   Aylwin's two-hour speech restored a tradition in Chile in which
the president delivers his annual state of the nation address
before Congress.
   During Pincohet's rule, congress was suspended and the annual
address was delivered before military commanders, government
officials and supporters.
   The 74-year-old general remains commander of the 60,000-man army.
   He has made clear his deep opposition to Aylwin's efforts to
investigate rights violations.
   Pinochet personally conveyed to Aylwin his concern over the
president's establishment in April of the Commission for Truth and
Reconciliation, which is gathering information on rights cases.
   The commission's work is expected to result in a number of
rights trials, many involving military officers.
   Aylwin insisted Monday that the commission not ``bring the armed
forces to trial.''
   The panel, he said, will not only investigate abuses committed
by security officials of the Pinochet regime, but also terrorist
attacks in which soldiers were the victims.
   After taking power in a 1973 coup, Pinochet launched a harsh
crackdown on the supporters of the ousted leftist government.
Thousands were arrested and many were tortured or killed. Tens of
thousands were forced into exile.
   Aylwin said in his speech that he wants a ``reconciliation among
civilians and military,'' but he admitted this would be difficult.
   ``For decades, the members of the armed forces had good reason
to feel segregated,'' Aylwin said. ``And for the last 16{ years, a
large portion of our population had good reasons to feel mistreated
and humiliated.''
   Aylwin said his government will also try to preserve and
strengthen the newly restored democracy, maintain economic
development, promote social justice and respect human rights.

   Veteran Congressman Larry Craig shook hands
with workers at shift changes Monday, confident of victory in the
GOP primary race to replace U.S. Sen. James McClure.
   ``I think it will be a good win, a strong win,'' said Craig, who
is favored to beat Attorney General Jim Jones in the primary
Tuesday.
   McClure, a Republican who served three terms, will retire at the
end of his current term.
   Jones, who raised just one-tenth of the $400,000 Craig gathered
to bankroll his campaign, also was in Boise Monday, but focused on
his official duties after his populist, shoestring campaign ran its
course.
   Beside voting, his only election-day plans were to take his
12-year-old daughter to lunch.
   ``At this point, the die is pretty much cast, and we'll see how
things come out,'' said Jones, who hoped for a relatively light
turnout that would indicate a failure of Craig's campaign to
energize voters.
   State election officials expected 30 percent to 35 percent of
registered voters to vote after a generally lackluster campaign for
one of only three U.S. Senate races this year without an incumbent
involved.
   Boise businessman Ron Twilegar, the former state Senate
Democratic leader, met with strategists on the eve of his
anticipated primary victory over political newcomer David Steed, an
Idaho Falls businessman.
   Twilegar admitted he faced an uphill battle in the fall for a
seat that has traditionally gone to the GOP.
   All three Republicans fighting for the right to block Democrat
Gov. Cecil Andrus' heavily favored bid for an unprecedented fourth
term this fall put in a final day of campaigning. Polls indicated
GOP voters remained largely undecided.
   State Sen. Rachel Gilbert of Boise, the chairman of the
tax-writing committee, pressed her claim to the front-runner's
spot, and former state Senate Majority Leader Roger Fairchild of
Fruitland admitted a low turnout would hand Ms. Gilbert the
nomination.
   Boise stockbroker Milton Erhart pinned his hopes on being the
only candidate in the field with a pro-choice abortion stand, and
he also needed a relatively high turnout to draw voters beyond the
traditional conservatives who generally dominate Idaho GOP
primaries.

<TEXT>
   Interim President Ion Iliescu captured
87 percent of the 6.7 million votes counted so far, but foreign
observers disagreed Monday whether Romania's first multiparty
election in 53 years was free of fraud.
   The main opposition parties charged results of Sunday's
balloting were rigged, called Romania's first attempt at democratic
voting a failure, and said they would contest the elections in
court.
   Ion Ratiu, the National Peasants' Party's presidential
candidate, said he would take legal action to have the election
declared ``null and void.''
   He vowed to fight ``against the renewal of Communism in
Romania,'' which he said Iliescu represents.
   Iliescu, 60, came to power in the December revolution against
Nicolae Ceausescu and was the heavy pre-election favorite. He drew
huge campaign crowds, especially in the countryside where he was
seen as the man who saved Romania from the Communist dictator.
   The campaign occasionally turned violent, but no major incidents
were reported Sunday.
   First official results published by the state news agency
Rompres suggested an overwhelming win for Iliescu.
   Most official results were not expected until Wednesday because
of the heavy turnout, estimated at more than 85 percent of the 16
million eligible voters, and the complicated ballot, which
contained more than 30 pages.
   The dispute among the 500 foreign observers who fanned out
across the country to watch the voting centered on whether a series
of irregularities added up to acceptable or unacceptable election
violations.
   Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers, R-N.M., the official U.S. government
observer, called the poll ``a good election'' and ``a very giant
step toward democracy.''
   Austrian parliamentarian Andreas Khol, general secretary of the
European Democratic Union, disagreed, saying: ``These were a big
step toward free and democratic elections, but they were not free
and not democratic elections.''
   Carruthers asked the Romanian government to set up mechanism to
investigate allegations of fraud and irregularities during the
campaign and voting.
   Prime Minister Petre Roman, a prominent member of Iliescu's
governing National Salvation Front, said later the Central
Electoral Bureau had set up a commission to investigate alleged
improprieties.
   ``Already some fraud was discovered,'' he told The Associated
Press, citing as an example what he said were 25 ballots
pre-stamped for the National Liberals' candidate, Radu Campeanu.
   In Washington, State Department Deputy Spokesman Richard Boucher
said voter fraud was minimal and hailed the elections as ``an
important beginning for Romania.
   ``We note that problems with voting and other election day
irregularities appear to have been minimal, although opposition
political party leaders have complained of breaches of election law
procedures,'' Boucher said.
   But he said the election campaign was flawed by candidates' lack
of access to the news media and the intimidation of opposition
candidates.
   He said there were no conclusions about possible U.S. economic
aid to Romania because ``our assessment of the elections is only
now beginning.''
   The United States has said future relations and U.S. trade
concessions, important to Romania's shattered economy, are
conditional on whether the elections were ``fully free and fair.''
   Rompres said that with 6.7 million votes counted, Iliescu had 87
percent; Campeanu 10 percent, and Ratiu, 3 percent.
   Its vote report also had the Front winning nearly two-thirds of
the seats in Parliament.
   A onetime Communist official who opposed Ceausescu in 1971,
Iliescu gained sympathy for being demoted and was far better known
and popular than either Campeanu or Ratiu, who spent decades in
exile.
   Iliescu won wide support from peasants by permitting them to own
large plots of land. Industrial workers, about 40 percent of
Romania's labor force, liked his pledges to move slowly in
transforming Romania's state-controlled economy to a capitalist
free market.
   Iliescu and the Front will likely be the first ex-Communists in
Eastern Europe to triumph in the region's current series of
multiparty elections.
   Initial Rompres results for the two-chamber Parliament gave the
Front about 65 percent; Liberals, 7 percent; Peasants, 3 percent;
and ecologists 3 percent.
   The Hungarian Democratic Union, representing Romania's 2 million
Hungarian minority, had about 7 to 8 percent. The other votes went
to tiny parties.
   Ratiu, who attended Carruthers' news conference, said the
governor's upbeat assessment would completely mislead Americans and
President Bush.
   Calling the election a fraud, Ratiu said, ``There was no
semblance of democracy about it.''
   ``We will contest the election if this is the sort of result
that we get,'' he said, pledging to demand new elections.
   The various observer groups reported instances of ballots
pre-stamped for Iliescu, Front members accompanying elderly voters
into the booth, non-registered voters casting ballots, and
individuals voting several times.
   Many observer complaints focused on the campaign rather than the
voting itself. Several alleged that the Front, which dominated the
interim government, unfairly controlled the election apparatus and
the electronic media.
   Carruthers and other observers urged the West and the new
Romanian government to work to create a free press as a guarantee
of future democracy.

<TEXT>
   The flash flood that turned this resort
town's main drag into a river receded as fast as it arrived, but a
new problem emerged from the muck Monday: The weekend flood caused
a drought of the thermal spring water that gave the town its name
and its tourist industry.
   The 13 inches of rain that fell in 24 hours knocked out the
pumps at the end of Bathhouse Row that supply 140-degree
underground water to the spas.
   It will take at least a week to fix them, said Roger Giddings,
superintendent of Hot Springs National Park, which runs the pumps.
   ``It's the lifeblood of Hot Springs,'' Giddings said of the
water that has has attracted the infirm, the health-conscious and
the athletic to this city of 36,000 for nearly a century.
   Elsewhere, waterlogged communities in Louisiana and Texas were
emerging from under floodwaters that have raged through several
states for days.
   Downtown Hot Springs, which lies in a steep valley, was flooded
when rain overwhelmed drainage systems. Nobody was injured, and a
preliminary, partial estimate by the city manager's office put
damage at $5.3 million to businesses and public works. That doesn't
include damage to more than 100 private homes.
   Business leaders were more concerned about a loss of business
than the temporary loss of water, which is pumped from the area's
23 springs to seven bathhouses and three hotels.
   At least 90 percent of the downtown business is linked to
tourism, and the city isn't ready to concede that kind of money to
a flood, especially with Memorial Day looming.
   On Monday, store owners replaced shattered windows and swept
away the mud. An advertising blitz was planned to let potential
tourists know the town is waiting with open arms.
   ``Our town and state have been shown to a national television
audience as being swept by torrents of raging rainfall,'' said Bob
Wheeler, a member of the city board of directors. ``True, here in
Hot Springs we had a bad Saturday night, but that is over and we
will be ready for summer vacationers by this weekend.''
   Elsewhere on Central Avenue, Don Wilson of the Salvation Army
handed out ham and cheese sandwiches from a beat-up food truck. Don
Heath, owner of Craft and Fair, watched as several workers hauled
his carpet out to the street and hosed off the sediment.
   ``I don't want to win any awards, but we were the hardest hit,''
said Imy Marcus, owner of the Toy Chest downtown. He said about
$30,000 worth of stuffed animals and dolls _ about 40 percent of
his inventory _ were swept away by the two flash floods that hit
Saturday and Sunday.
   His store will be open by next week, Marcus said.
   Far worse was the plight of the owners of about 136 homes
destroyed by the flood. Flooding along Lake Catherine, about 20
miles from downtown, appeared to be the worst.
   Phil Phillips, whose house sits about 20 feet from the lake,
picked through his soggy furnishings. ``This fiddle was made in
1814,'' he told a reporter. ``Can't tell you how much it's worth.''
   His wife, Edith, said the water rose to the rooftop but dropped
to puddle-level within a few hours Sunday morning.
   ``It came so quick and did so much,'' she said.
   In Louisiana, the Red River that runs through the Red River
Parish northeast of Alexandria began inching back toward its banks.
   Flood covered at least 140 square miles of farmland and drove
more than 300 people from their homes in the past week. Most were
able to return by Monday, officials said.
   ``We're in better shape now than we've been in a long time,''
said Chief Warren Perkins of the Red River Sheriff's Office.
``We're just worried about more rain. ... I suspect a lot of people
will leave the sand bags in place for a while.''
   In southeast Texas, the Trinity River's rise in Liberty County
appeared to slow Monday.
   The Trinity hit a record of 29.51 feet in Liberty on Monday, and
the National Weather Service said it was expected to crest at 29.6
feet Thursday, 5.6 feet above flood stage. It could be weeks before
the Trinity is back in its banks, officials said.
   An estimated 4,600 homes have been affected by flooding in a
seven-county area, although Red Cross spokesman Bill Barron said he
didn't know whether that many homes actually had been flooded.

<HEAD>Police Strike Threatening Ivory Coast Leader's Grip on Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police went on strike Monday, firing
shots into the air and shooting out the tires of cars and buses,
further threatening this embattled government's grip on power.
   State radio said Ivory Coast President Felix Houphouet-Boigny
met with a delegation of police and promised to review their
demands, and by late afternoon police appeared to have returned to
their regular duties.
   The radio gave no further information. Houphouet-Boigny has met
with various striking groups in recent weeks, including the
military, and each time promised to improve their conditions.
   Although France recently stepped up aid to this former colony,
it was not clear how Houphouet-Boigny would be able to fulfill his
promises. The government has been unable to pay its foreign debt,
and has had difficulty meeting government payrolls.
   The police strike came as no surprise after last week's army
mutiny. Soldiers took over the national broadcast center twice and
on May 16 seized the Abidjan airport for nine hours. They left
after being promised their demands for better pay and working
conditions would be met.
   Many of the mutinous soldiers were conscripts who said despite
difficult conditions they wanted to remain in the military because
they believed they had no hope of finding other jobs.
   France, a strong supporter of Houphouet-Boigny, refused his
request to intervene and dislodge the soldiers from the airport.
But it did send a top paramilitary police official to Abidjan to
advise the president.
   Two days after the airport seizure, the government announced it
had met the soldiers' demands. Several other groups, including bus
drivers, have launched strikes, and have also won their demands.
   The economic difficulties are the result of a sharp fall in
prices for the country's main exports, cocoa and coffee.
   The wave of protests began after the president, under pressure
from foreign creditors, tried to impose austerity measures in March.
   The protests forced the closing of schools for the rest of the
year and the withdrawal of the austerity measures.
Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's longest serving president, also was
forced to ease severe restrictions against opposition parties.
   Houphouet's Democratic Party has ruled the country as a de facto
one-party state since independence from France in 1960.

<HEAD>Federal Standards for Medical Laboratories Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300,000 medical laboratories,
including those in physicians' offices, would have to meet federal
standards, under regulations proposed Monday.
   The regulations written by the Department of Health and Human
Services are aimed at assuring the quality and accuracy of medical
tests, said HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   ``Under our plan, every laboratory, regardless of its location,
must be federally certified as meeting quality standards,'' he
said. ``Labs must prove they can perform their tests correctly.''
   Under the proposal, laboratory tests would be divided into three
categories.
   Tests that are complex and pose a high risk if done incorrectly,
such as Pap smears to test for cervical cancer, and simpler tests
with some risk, like cholesterol screening, would be subject to
federal standards.
   Twenty-eight tests that HHS describes as simple with low-risk,
such as dipstick urinalysis, would be waived from regulation.
   Labs that fail to comply with federal requirements for quality
control, personnel qualifications and proficiency testing could
have their certification revoked, suspended or limited or suffer
other civil penalties.
   The regulation would implement a law passed by Congress in 1988
after reports about inaccuracies in Pap smear tests.

<HEAD>Greece Announces Full Recognition of Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece has granted full diplomatic
recognition to Israel for the first time since the Jewish state was
founded in 1948, Premier Constantine Mitsotakis said Monday.
   He told a Cabinet meeting Greece has also upgraded ties with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Greece is the last member of the 12-nation European Community to
grant Israel full recognition.
   But Mitsotakis said that de jure recognition ``does not
recognize the annexation nor the occupation by Israel of Arab
territories seized in 1967.''
   Greece has often expressed its opposition to Israel's continued
occupation of the West Bank and its policy toward the Palestinians.
   Mitsotakis made a campaign pledge to recognize Israel prior to
the April 8 general election.
   He said Greek ties with the PLO would resemble those now
existing between France and the PLO. France recognizes the missions
of Quebec and the PLO in Paris as general delegations and their
representatives as delegate general. It traditionally recognizes
countries and not governments or movements.
   The PLO's status as a general delegation is the only of its kind
in France. It is less than a full state and does not imply
diplomatic recognition.
   The PLO maintains a diplomatic mission in Athens and its ranking
member is accorded the title of head of mission.
   Israel's diplomatic representative will now have full
ambassadorial recognition.
   A Foreign Ministry announcement said that ``in agreement with
the maintenance of friendly relations between states, the Greek
government and the government of Israel have decided to upgrade the
status of their relative diplomatic representations to the status
of embassies.''
   The announcement said representatives of both governments met
Monday in Brussels and announced their new diplomatic status in a
joint statement.

<HEAD>Wolf Study Sent to Congress; McClure To Call for Wolf Transplants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study on how wolves might act in
Yellowstone National Park was sent to Congress on Monday, but one
senator won't wait for that report to be dissected before
legislating the predator's return.
   As summaries of the study were shipped to Capitol Hill, word
came from Sen. James McClure's office that the Idaho Republican
would call this week for wolves to be transplanted to Yellowstone
as well as the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in
central Idaho.
   In Yellowstone, meanwhile, Superintendent Bob Barbee hailed the
586-page study compiled by the National Park Service and U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service as the most thorough document yet on wolves.
   U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee, however, called it ``poppycock.''
   ``They established where they wanted to get to, and then did
their study and made their evaluations so they could arrive at that
point,'' the Montana Republican said.
   The study, put together with information from wolf experts from
throughout the world and researchers from three universities,
predicts little impact on wildlife or livestock near Yellowstone if
wolves are returned.
   However, it speculates that some wolves would leave
Yellowstone's boundaries and have to be controlled by one means or
another to protect livestock interests.
   While some critics of the recovery plan fear wolves would
decimate Yellowstone's big game herds, the study said the available
prey base was at least five times greater than that which 100
wolves _ the ideal recovery population _ would be expected to
reduce or even limit.
   The study said at least 30 wolves would have to be released
initially to assure the program's success. It also suggested that
wolves returned to Yellowstone be considered a ``nonessential
experimental population'' so biologists would have freer rein in
controlling them than if they were covered by the full Endangered
Species Act.
   It also calls for more studies on the predator, and the Park
Service has budgeted $175,000 for that work this fiscal year.
   Bryce Dustman, press secretary for Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana
Republican who is opposed to the wolf program, said he wasn't
surprised by the report's claim that wolves would have little
effect on wildlife or livestock.
   He said ``it jumped out at him'' that the two leading proponents
of wolf restoration in Yellowstone _ the Park Service and Fish and
Wildlife Service _ wrote a study saying the wolf wouldn't have a
detrimental affect on livestock or big game.

<HEAD>Stormie Not Rejecting Liver, May Return Home Soon</HEAD>

   Doctors on Monday increased Stormie Jones'
doses of an experimental drug and were hopeful the world's longest
surviving heart-liver transplant recipient will not reject her
second donor liver.
   ``We're not alarmed,'' said Dr. Robert D. Gordon of Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh. Gordon operated on Stormie's first
transplant on Feb. 14, 1984.
   ``This is a mild rejection episode. It is not a serious crisis
event. We don't think this liver is in jeopardy or that she's
looking at another transplant. She just needed an adjustment in her
medication,'' he said.
   The 12-year-old girl returned to Pittsburgh Sunday after routine
tests revealed she had high liver enzyme levels _ a sign of
possible organ rejection from the Feb. 20 transplant of the second
donor liver.
   Gordon said doctors found Stormie wasn't receiving adequate
doses of FK-506, an experimental anti-rejection medication approved
by the Food and Drug Administration for use only at two University
of Pittsburgh hospitals.
   Stormie will receive higher doses of FK-506 intravenously until
she is discharged and later will take the drug orally. Doctors said
they hoped she could return to home to the Dallas suburb of White
Settlement, Texas, within a few days.
   That's good news for Stormie, who has been eagerly awaiting a
party for her 13th birthday on May 31, said her mother, Lois
``Suzie'' Purcell.
   ``Thirteen is a very special time in someone's life. So she's
looking forward to that,'' she said. ``She's excited. She's running
around all over the place.''
   National attention has been focused on Stormie since she
received the historic 1984 heart-liver transplant to control a
congenital condition that left her cholesterol levels 10 times
higher than normal.
   She returned to Pittsburgh in November 1989 after hepatitis
damaged her first donor liver. Up until that time, she had been
taking cyclosporine, an anti-rejection medication that lowers the
body's ability to fight infection.

   A heavily armed man who was upset
at renovations to a church wounded two people and barricaded
himself inside the church with a hostage for seven hours Monday
before killing himself.
   Officers fired tear gas and stormed St. Sebastian-By-The Sea
Episcopal Church at 3:15 p.m. to find the body of the man,
identified by police as Douglas Pearson, 47.
   Pearson was a member of a church building committee and church
members said he had been upset about renovations at the church,
including a plan to add trim to the church's new copper steeple,
said committee member Ted Ferris.
   Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for the Brevard County Sheriff's
Department, said the gunman apparently shot himself.
   The hostage, Deacon George Smodell, crawled out as police
stormed the church, Heller said. Smodell was in stable condition at
Holmes Regional Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the leg, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   The gunman also went to the red brick church Saturday night,
armed and upset, Heller said. Police were called, and confiscated
two assault rifles and a pistol then.
   On Monday, he had a .357-caliber Magnum and .45-caliber pistol,
authorities said.
   The attacks began about 8:40 a.m. when Pearson's wife called
police to say: ``He's all upset. He has guns.''
   A short time later, in Melbourne Beach, a 43-year-old woman was
shot twice in the abdomen at point-blank range in her home with a
.45-caliber pistol, Heller said.
   The woman, Diane Conarroe, was the wife of a church official,
said Ted Ferris, a member of the church building committee. Pearson
went to the home looking for John Conarroe, but shot his wife
instead when she answered the door, Ferris said.
   Mrs. Conarroe was in critical condition at Holmes Regional
Medical Center, said Debbie Helton, a hospital spokeswoman.
   A few minutes later, the gunman walked into an office, shot the
deacon, and then ordered painter David Oraboni and a secretary to
leave.
   ``He walked right by me,'' Oraboni said. ``I said `Good morning'
to him and he said `Good morning.' Not more than 10 seconds later
he pulled out a gun and started shooting. At first I didn't think
it was real.''
   While barricaded in the church, the gunman ignored repeated
calls from police negotiators using the telephone and a bullhorn,
said J.D. Wilmer, a sheriff's inspector who was one of the
negotiators.
   Building committee member Ferris said Pearson had been upset for
about a week about restoration work on the 25-year-old church,
including a plan to add trim to the copper steeple. He talked to
Pearson by telephone about 7:30 a.m.
   ``I knew he had some grudges against some people in the
church,'' Ferris said. ``He said on the phone `this was (his) last
hurrah.' '' Ferris added that he thought Pearson meant the last
church remodeling project.
   Ferris said Pearson, who moved to Florida from Toronto about
three years ago, worked in construction and design.
   Melbourne Beach is on the east coast of central Florida.
   The church is just across the Intracoastal Waterway from Palm
Bay, where on April 24, 1987, a gunman killed six people and
wounded 10 in two shopping centers. He then held a supermarket
employee hostage for five hours before being captured by police
officers. William Cruse, a former librarian, was convicted of the
killings and sentenced to death in July 1989.

   Bodyguards for one of President Virgilio
Barco's grandchildren extinguished the burning fuse of a dynamite
bomb set Monday in front of the child's school in Bogota, a
diplomatic source and a teacher said.
   In the cocaine capital of Medellin, meanwhile, two men on a
motorcycle killed federal Sen. Federico Estrada and his chauffeur
in their car Monday. Estrada was a former member of the Supreme
Court and former ambassador to Italy.
   The bomb was in front of the Helvetia school, a spokesman for
the Swiss Embassy told The Associated Press on condition he not be
identified for security reasons. The private school is known as
Bogota's Swiss school. Many upper-class families send their
children there.
   The dynamite was in two large burlap bags on a sidewalk in front
of the school in northern Bogota, Ascal Stoffer, a teacher at the
school, told The AP.
   No one claimed responsibility, but drug traffickers have killed
scores of people with bombs in Colombia the last nine months.
   ``We were saved because bodyguards of the grandchild of the
president were able to put out the fuse in time,'' Stoffer said in
a telephone interview.
   He said bodyguards spotted the burning fuse while bringing the
child to school.
   Barco has two grandchildren, both girls, attending the school in
this city of 6 million people.
   The dynamite bomb was 1{ miles from where a car bomb exploded
Sunday night, wounding 16 people.
   Barco's senior Cabinet minister, Horacio Serpa, called that
bombing an obvious attempt by drug traffickers to scare people away
from the polls in next Sunday's presidential elections.
   In reply to a question, he said he did not know if the bomb at
the school was an attempt to kill one or both of the president's
grandchildren.
   Serpa met with the reporters at the presidential palace after
meeting with Barco. As minister of government, Serpa is in charge
of security in Colombia.
   Five car bombs exploded in Bogota, Cali and Cartagena in the
previous eight days, killing 28 people and wounding more than 300.
   Barco ordered security forces to destroy drug traffickers last
Aug. 18 after presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan was
assassinated by traffickers.
   Traffickers have set off dozens of bombs since then, including
one that killed all 107 passengers aboard a domestic airliner.
Police also blame traffickers for the slaying of two more
presidential candidates.
   National Police headquarters in Medellin said police had no
leads on who shot Estrada and his driver.
   Drug traffickers kidnapped Estrada a month ago and released him
unharmed two days later with no ransom paid. Neither police nor
senator said why he was kidnapped.
   In the previous 12 days in Medellin, 25 police have been killed
and 25 wounded. The police blame all the deaths on drug
traffickers, who have offered about $4,000 for each policeman
killed there.

   Tranquility won over tradition Monday
as a judge ordered that the Hatfield town bell be silenced at
night, ruling in favor of a couple of newcomers who said the
cherished custom kept them awake.
   The ruling was greeted with relief by the couple and with dismay
by townsfolk who had argued that the hourly chiming was a treasured
part of the New England character of their 320-year-old farming
community.
   ``I think it's lousy,'' Selectman Chairman George Zgrodnick Jr.
said after Hampshire Superior Court Judge John F. Murphy ordered
that the 92-year-old bell be turned off after 9 p.m. and before 7
a.m.
   ``A certain part of the heritage of the town has been disrupted
and I think that's very important, Selectman Thomas Hurley said.
   W. Michael Ryan, who represented newcomers Richard and Pamela
Carnall, said the ruling, effective immediately, actually harks
back to an old tradition of ringing the bell at curfew.
   ``We've ended a 20th-century tradition and revived a
colonial-federalist era tradition,'' Ryan said.
   The Carnalls were unavailable for comment Monday, but Ryan said
he had spoken to them.
   ``They're pretty private people. They have not enjoyed being in
the public spotlight over this but they just felt that it was
necessary to endure the publicity in order to obtain a relief,'' he
said.
   Zgrodnick said the ruling would mean turning off the bell all
the time, at least for now, because the town doesn't have the funds
for an automatic timer. Earlier, the Carnalls had offered to pay
for such a device, but Ryan said the offer has been withdrawn.
   The selectmen said it was too soon to tell if townsfolk would
authorize money for an appeal, but that it would be discussed.
   The Carnalls moved from nearby Northampton in August 1988 and
bought a 19th-century house on Main Street across from the First
Congregational Church.
   The bell, housed in the church that once doubled as town hall,
was broken at the time. But six months later it was fixed and is
hourly resonant chiming resumed. The couple complained they and
their young daughter couldn't sleep. After selectmen refused to
stop the chiming, the Carnalls filed a civil suit against the town.
Jurors ruled May 14 that the bell was a nuisance, but decided that
only Mrs. Carnall was injured by its ringing and that neither
plaintiff was entitled to damages.
   Based on the ruling, the Carnalls asked Murphy to grant an
injunction that the bell be silenced after 9 p.m. and before 7 a.m.
   Town Counsel William O'Neil had argued that the injunction
shouldn't be granted because the jury's verdict was mixed. But the
judge agreed with the jurors that the ringing was a nuisance.

<HEAD>Syria Rebuffs Iraqi Invitation to Arab League Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hafez Assad on Monday snubbed
an Iraqi invitation to attend an Arab League summit and reiterated
it should be preceded by preparations in a meeting of foreign
ministers, an official said.
   But Assad made a conciliatory gesture toward Baghdad and said he
would stand by Iraq in the event of an Israeli attack.
   Earlier Monday, Iraqi Justice Minister Akram Abdul-Qader arrived
here carrying an invitation to the May 28 summit in Baghdad from
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Abdul-Qader left for home after his meeting with Assad _ the
first visit by an Iraqi official to Syria since the two countries
broke diplomatic relations in 1979. Assad and Saddam are heads of
rival branches of the socialist Baath party and are bitter enemies.
   The feud deepened during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war in which
Syria supported Iran. After the war ended, Saddam backed Christian
militias in Lebanon against Syrian-supported Moslem militias.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Assad
supported the idea of the summit, but reiterated Syria's initial
stand.
   This was that the summit's location and agenda must first be
discussed at an emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the
22-member Arab League in Tunisia. He also has categorically
rejected Baghdad as a host location.
   The foreign ministers are scheduled to meet Tuesday in Baghdad.
   But the source said Assad's reply also stated that ``it must be
clarified that independently from the issue of the summit, Syria
will stand with all its might next to Iraq or any other Arab
country exposed to Israeli aggression.''
   In a related development Lebanese Premier Salim Hoss, a close
Syrian ally, informed the Arab League that his country will not
attend the Baghdad summit, a source in Beirut said.
   Also Monday, Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat's political and security adviser, Hani al-Hassan, said he
met with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa Sunday night in an
attempt to convince Syria to attend the summit.
   ``Palestine is very keen on Syria's participation in the
forthcoming summit and President Arafat is trying his utmost to
ensure an atmosphere of pan-Arab understanding,'' Hassan told The
Associated Press.
   ``The Syrian-Iraqi reconciliation is for us the cornerstone for
building our confrontation with the Israeli fascist right-wing,''
he added.
   The PLO called for the summit to discuss the immigration of
hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews to Israel, which the PLO views
as a threat.
   Saddam said threats to Iraqi security will also be on the
agenda, an issue Syrian officials said they could not support.
   Saddam is seeking to rally support after Britain and the United
States accused Iraq of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers to
Baghdad. Iraq has denied it is developing nuclear weapons but
threatened to use chemical weapons against Israel if attacked.
   The Iraqis are also seeking to rally support after Iraq-bound
shipments said to contain parts for a ``super gun'' capable of
hitting Israel were seized in Britain, Greece, Turkey and Italy.

   Leftist rebel leaders said
Monday they reserve the right to launch another offensive if
current peace talks with President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist
government fail to produce a cease-fire and agreement to end the
decade-old war.
   The warning was contained in a statement distributed here by the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla
organization also known as FMLN, shortly after representatives from
both sides signed an agenda for peace negotiations in Caracas, the
Venezuelan capital.
   The agenda, signed after five days of talks, commits the two
sides to agree on a cease-fire by mid-September, or earlier if
political accords necessary for its implementation are reached
before then.
   The negotiators, who met under the supervision of a United
Nations official, also agreed to meet again to pursue the talks in
mid-June. But it did not immediately specify the place or exact
date.
   The FMLN's statement accused government troops of leading a
nationwide offensive against guerrilla positions last week. The
director of the armed forces press office was unavailable for
comment on the allegation.
   Fighting continued while the talks were going on in Venezuela,
but daily reports during the past week did not seem to indicate a
sharp increase in the conflict.
   ``The FMLN reiterates that, as long is there is no cease-fire
concerted by means of political accords, and as long as there is no
end to military impunity and no concrete commitments to the
demilitarization of the country, we reserve the legitimate right to
defend ourselves,'' the statement said.
   It said this included ``launching of offensives of any size
whenever they might be necessary anywhere in the country.''
   The FMLN launched a large offensive against the capital and
three other cities in November, the biggest since the civil war
began in October 1979. An estimated 2,000 people were killed in the
month-long fighting.

   Israeli soldiers shot
and killed three Palestinians and wounded up to 112 on Monday in
violence set off by the massacre of seven Palestinian laborers by
an Israeli civilian the day before.
   The suspect in Sunday's killings was identified as Ami Popper, a
21-year-old Israeli discharged from the army as unfit and
characterized by authorities as ``deranged'' and upset by an
unhappy love affair. Police held him in custody, and a judge
ordered psychiatric tests.
   In Amman, Jordan, a 28-year-old Palestinian with a pistol and a
dagger wounded nine French tourists and a Jordanian photographer on
a tour bus. Police there said he was out to avenge Sunday's
killings, but did not elaborate.
   Thousands of Palestinian demonstrators marched in protest toward
the U.S. Embassy in Amman and fought police who got in their way.
At least 20,000 Palestinian residents of Baqaa Refugee Camp
demonstrated, and police used tear gas when the protesters tried to
march to Amman, 17 miles away.
   In Washington, about 75 demonstrators gathered near the State
Deparment and burned an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir. Some waved Palestinian flags and chanted, ``Palestinian
statehood now!''
   Smoke from burning tires rose above towns and refugee camps in
the Gaza Strip, home to the seven men gunned down Sunday while
waiting for day laborers' jobs in a Tel Aviv suburb.
   Youths on rooftops hurled stones at army patrols. Women in
traditional Palestinian dress screamed and chanted as wounded
victims were brought to the U.N. clinic in this refugee camp.
   Arab reports listed 103 Palestinians wounded in the Gaza Strip
and nine shot and wounded in scattered clashes in the occupied West
Bank.
   The army confirmed the three deaths and reported 40 Palestinians
were wounded in Gaza. It said it was checking the other reports.
   Arab leaders said the Sunday massacre was the result of an
anti-Arab atmosphere encouraged by Shamir's hard-line policies.
   At a news conference in Baghdad, Iraq, Yasser Arafat asked
President Bush on Monday to pressure Israel to stop what Arafat
called ``atrocities'' against the Palestinian people.
   Arafat, chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization, rejected
Israeli claims that the lone gunman was mentally unbalanced and
accused Shamir of planning ``a criminal scheme against the
Palestinians and the intefadeh'' _ the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied lands.
   The killings touched off riots in which seven more Palestinians
were killed by Israeli soldiers. On the floor of Parliament on
Monday, Arab Parliament member Abdel Wahab Daroushe called fellow
lawmakers ``murderers.''
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher criticized the
Israeli army for its handling of the riots Sunday.
   ``We are disturbed by the number of casualties inflicted by the
Israeli Army,'' Boucher said in Washington. ``We have repeatedly
called upon the government of Israel to exercise restraint.''
   At least eight soldiers or police and two Israeli civilians were
reported injured by stones Monday in Gaza and Israel, where
protests by Arab citizens erupted in a half-dozen towns.
   In the mixed Arab-Jewish city of Haifa, swastikas were painted
on walls. In the northern town of Nazareth, a group of American
tourists was stranded briefly inside a hotel as youths threw
firebombs and burned tires.
   Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, commander of troops in Gaza, told
reporters he was worried about an upsurge of revenge attacks on
Israelis because of the killings.
   In Jerusalem's Ein Karem neighborhood, 40-year-old Jewish
restaurant owner Yaacov Shalom was slain Sunday night, reportedly
by Arabs.
   Police said it was unclear if the motive was political, but the
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility in an
anonymous phone call in Nicosia, Cyprus, and said it was revenge
for the Sunday slayings.
   Monday's deaths raised to 705 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israelis during the 29-month-old Palestinian uprising against
Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forty-three Israelis
have been slain in the revolt, and 216 Palestinians have been
killed by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators.
   Dan Naveh, the spokesman for Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, said
Palestinian and other Arab leaders were trying to exploit Sunday's
killings by ``a crazed gunman.''
   ``We call on them to be restrained and not cynically use the
tragic incident to fan the flames of violence,'' he said in a
statement.
   Survivors told reporters the gunman ordered a group of 50
workers to sit in a line and then opened fire with an assault rifle.
   The rioting that broke out later was the worst bloodshed in the
uprising since April 15, 1988. On that day, 17 Palestinians died in
riots after PLO military leader Khalil Wazir was slain in Tunis,
reportedly by Israeli commandos.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said the government had no
responsibility for the attack Sunday on the Palestinian laborers.
   ``In the United States, very often similar incidents occur when
a crazy person takes to the street and shoots people,'' he said.
``There is no connection with the government.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Monday he wants to know
``the highest level of authority'' that approved the alleged
kidnapping of a Mexican doctor charged in the murder of U.S. drug
agent Enrique Camarena.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ordered government
prosecutors to disclose the information at a hearing scheduled for
Friday on the manner in which Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was
brought to the United States for trial.
   The alleged kidnapping of the Guadalajara gynecologist April 2
has strained relations between the United States and Mexico.
Mexican officials, including President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
have called the operation a violation of their national sovereignty.
   Rafeedie has demanded to know how Alvarez was brought here from
Mexico. Alvarez's trial has been indefinitely delayed pending the
outcome of the hearing.
   Camarena, 31, an agent for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, was kidnapped off a Guadalajara street in February
1985. Testimony at the trial of three other men in 1988 showed that
he was taken to a house and tortured and interrogated by drug
lords, then slain along with his pilot. Their bodies were found a
month later on a ranch 65 miles outside Guadalajara.
   Prosecutors maintain that Alvarez gave Camarena drugs to revive
him for additional torture before his slaying.
   Three Mexican men and a Honduran currently are on trial for
their alleged roles in the murder of Camarena, the pilot and two
tourists who prosecutors say were mistaken for drug agents and
slain.
   At a status conference to discuss Friday's hearing, Rafeedie,
referring to the alleged abduction, told prosecutors: ``I'd like to
know the highest level of authority who authorized this.''
   Outside court, Alvarez's lawyer, Robert Steinberg, said he would
call four or five witnesses at the hearing. Among them, he said,
would be Antonio Garate Bustamante, a former Mexican police officer
who has said he arranged the doctor's abduction from his
Guadalajara office at the behest of the DEA.
   Steinberg alleged that Garate is wanted in Mexico for a 1986
murder and said, ``The DEA brought a killer here to hunt killers.''
   DEA officials have vowed to capture and prosecute every person
involved in the Camarena murder.
   Steinberg said he would argue that Rafeedie has no jurisdiction
over the Alvarez matter and should send it to the World Court at
The Hague in the Netherlands for resolution. Barring that, he said,
the judge should order Alvarez returned to Mexico.
   ``My basic motion is to send him home,'' the attorney said.
``Give it to the Mexican authorities and let them prosecute it, if
they wish.''

   Gramajo was the only survivor of the original cabinet President
Vinicio Cerezo named when he took office Jan. 14, 1986, for a
5-year term.
   He had been in the army for 36 years and the retirement appeared
to be part of military routine rather than politically based.
   Gen. Juan Jose Marroquin Siliezar replaced Bolanos as military
chief of staff and Gen. Roberto Enrique Mata Galvez moved up to
assistant chief of staff, the job Marroquin had filled.

   A 6-year-old boy worried about his parents
hammered through a barricaded bedroom door to find them shot to
death in an apparent murder-suicide, authorities said Monday.
   Found dead of shotgun blasts were Marie Morgan, 35, and her
husband Anthony Morgan, 34, said Bexar County sheriff's Deputy
Chief Jim DeLesdernier.
   ``It's obvious he shot her and then killed himself,''
DeLesdernier said. ``We looked for a (suicide) note but didn't find
one.''
   The boy and two siblings, ages 3 and 4, discovered the deaths
Sunday afternoon.
   ``They had gotten up yesterday morning and had eaten some
cereal, and tried to wake Mommy and Daddy up, and he had the door
barricaded and they couldn't get into it,'' DeLesdernier said.
   ``Long about yesterday afternoon they got concerned that they
couldn't wake up Mommy and Daddy and got the hammer.''
   The eldest child was able to beat a small hole in the door and
saw his mother on the bed. The children then went to a relative's
house nearby for help.
   Morgan, an electrician, may have been depressed about being
unemployed, but Mrs. Morgan was working and those close to the
family did not think there were serious financial problems.

   Police say a man arrested for trying to
break into a hotel picked the wrong room _ one occupied by a
visiting police chief.
   ``I told him the next time you try to burglarize a place, do it
where there's not a police convention,'' Wrangell Police Chief
Brent Moody said Monday.
   Moody was in Juneau for the convention of the Alaska Police
Officers Association. He and his wife were sleeping in thir
second-floor room at the Westmark Juneau Hotel when a man tried to
break a window about 6 a.m. Sunday.
   The man apparently hit the triple-pane window with a board, but
the glass did not break, Moody said.
   The noise woke the couple up, and Moody grabbed his gun. He
called the front desk to summon police, then waited almost a minute
as the suspect tried to pry open the window with the board.
   ``He had his hand inside the window and was trying to unlatch
the lock,'' Moody said. The chief then tried to grab the man's arm,
but as ``I pointed my gun at him he took off.''
   Juneau police soon grabbed the suspect a few blocks away.
   Ricky S. Sumdum, 31, was arraigned in state District Court on
one count of attempted criminal trespass. If convicted, he faces up
to one year in prison and a $5,000 fine. He was being held Monday
at the Lemon Creek Correctional Center in lieu of $250 bail.
   Juneau Police Capt. Mel Personett said the would-be burglar
apparently climbed atop a first-story roof extension behind the
hotel to reach the second-floor window.

   Gunmen who killed three people in a Harlem bar

   After the gunmen fled from the shooting at the International

   In the pictures, the three men posed gangland-style and
displayed a Mac-9 machine gun, a .30-caliber rifle and a 9mm
automatic pistol.
   ``I'm confident we'll be picking them up soon. It's not too hard

Manhattan detectives.
   ``We have street names of the three but nothing more definite
than that,'' the captain added. Detectives spent hours Monday at
police headquarters going through records in an attempt to trace
the suspects' identities, McKenna said.
   Investigators still have not determined a motive for the
shootings, which occurred Sunday at about 2:50 a.m. EDT.

   The U.S. government Monday agreed to pay Manuel
Noriega's attorneys, saying the ousted Panamanian ruler should be
assured a fair trial on drug charges.
   The defense attorneys agreed to the deal offered by U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, saying Noriega would sign promises to pay
the government back if $20 million in assets are released.
   Noriega's lawyers had threatened to withdraw from the case,
saying they could no longer function without money to pay for the
complex and lengthy legal proceedings. They wanted the government
to release money from 27 Noriega accounts frozen around the world,
assets prosecutors value at about $20 million.
   The attorneys had subpoenaed pay records from the CIA, Drug
Enforcement Administration and other intelligence agencies to show
Noriega had income other than alleged drug bribes from Colombia's
Medellin drug cartel.
   But at Monday's hearing they asked that both the defense motion
to withdraw from the case and the subpoenas be suspended until a
formal fee arrangement was worked out. The motion to withdraw and
the subpoenas would then be dropped, the defense team said.
   Federal prosecutors acknowledged Monday that Noriega received
secret payoffs from U.S. intelligence agencies but disputed defense
figures that put the amount at $11 million. The issue was expected
to be the centerpiece of Monday's hearing until the arrangement for
the attorney fees was disclosed.
   The prosecution ``wanted to avoid litigation that would get into
matters having to do, certainly, with classified information, with
payments by our government and other governments to Noriega,''
defense attorney Jon May said. ``It was in their interests to do
so.''
   Lehtinen told U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler during a
hearing that the federal Criminal Justice Act included provisions
for the fee arrangement.
   ``Some cases are exceedingly complex, some are extremely long,''
said Lehtinen. ``It would be reasonable for counsel to be appointed
by the court, and those fees paid by the government.''
   The judge set at hearing for Thursday to discuss details of the
fees.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino said he was satisfied with the
proposal.
   ``We do concur with them. We think this particular section (of
the law) may solve the problem in extreme cases of this nature,''
he said.
   Rubino said Noriega, who was in court but did not testify,
agreed to sign affidavits declaring he was indigent and that if his
assets were freed he would repay the federal government.
   Rubino has said Noriega received $11 million from the United
States for information about drug smuggling, along with $6 million
or $7 million from as yet unidentified foreign countries.
   Prosecutors acknowledge that the United States paid Noriega, but
dispute the details.
   ``The government believes that the amount is substantially less
than that offered by the defense counsel,'' Diane Cossin,
spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, said Monday. ``I cannot
be more specific because that information is not public.''
   One account alone, in the United Kingdom, has about $10 million
in it, said defense attorney Steven Kollin. Under classified
information rules governing the trial, the attorneys could not say
whose name was on the account, but exchanges in court indicate it
may be the name of Noriega's wife.
   ``There is money in that account, and that's what we're fighting
for,'' Kollin said.
   Hoeveler had urged prosecutors to expedite action on the asset
issue, saying he views the question of attorneys' fees as extremely
important.
   The judge has expressed skepticism of government claims that the
money is all drug-related, saying as a military officer and leader
of a country, Noriega must have had legitimate income.
   Noriega was indicted in February 1988 on charges of accepting
$4.6 million in bribes from the Medellin cartel in exchange for
turning Panama into a safe haven and transit point to support
cocaine smuggling into the United States.
   He turned himself in to U.S. authorities on Jan. 4, two weeks
after the invasion of Panama, and was flown to Florida, where he is
being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center outside
of Miami.

   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard, Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney's chief lieutenant in Quebec, resigned
Monday, dealing what may be a fatal blow to the Meech Lake accord
on keeping Quebec in the federation.
   The 1987 accord, a proposed constitutional amendment, would give
provinces special powers and recognize Quebec as a ``distinct
society'' within Canada. All 10 provinces by law have a June 23
deadline to ratify the accord.
   The constitutional dispute over the accord has revived
independence talk in Quebec, a largely French-speaking province.
   Bouchard and Mulroney agreed that Bouchard would quit after an
hourlong meeting at the prime minister's residence Monday, sources
told the Canadian Press news agency.
   Bouchard, 52, was considered the leader of the nationalists in
the 61-member Quebec Conservative caucus in parliament.
   Other Quebec nationalists are likely to view his resignation as
rejection of a special House of Commons committee report
recommending ratification of the Meech Lake accord and of added
measures contained in a companion resolution.
   Bouchard got in trouble after sending a telegram of
encouragement to the Parti Quebecois, which in 1980 fought for an
independent Quebec.
   Mulroney counts Bouchard among his oldest and closest political
friends.
   In a telegram sent to a Parti Quebecois meeting in Alma, Quebec,
Bouchard praised those who fought for an independent Quebec during
the 1980 referendum.
   He refused to apologize for the telegram Sunday after arriving
from Paris at Mirabel airport outside Montreal. He said he was
proud of having worked for sovereignty-association and praised
former party leader Rene Levesque.
   The telegram outraged opposition lawmakers in Ottawa, but was
greeted with a standing ovation by party workers in Alma after it
was read aloud Saturday by party leader Jacques Parizeau.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Upholds Judge's Age Discrimination Suit</HEAD>

   Vermont Supreme Court Justice Louis Peck
can remain on the bench even though he is past the state's
mandatory retirement age for judges, a federal appeals court ruled
Monday.
   The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes almost
a year after Peck was scheduled to be retired by the state because
he had turned 70.
   The state Constitution calls on all judges to retire at age 70,
but Peck had fought the provision, saying it conflicted with a
federal age discrimination law.
   ``I feel like a condemned man who has had a reprieve,'' said
Peck Monday night after learning of the decision. ``Personally it
is very satisfying.''
   Peck, now 71, said he will now give some thought to stepping
down. ``I may retire anyway,'' he said.
   The ruling by the New York-based federal appeals court settles
the Peck case, but it does not settle the issue. Two other federal
appeals courts, the 8th Circuit and 1st Circuit, have ruled the
other way on the question, which means judges in those
jurisdictions must adhere to their states' mandatory retirement
provisions.
   ``Obviously Congress has not made its intention clear if the
court disagree,'' said William Gray, the lawyer who represented the
state of Vermont in the suit against Peck.
   Gray said it would be several weeks before the state decided
whether it would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``Taking away from states the power to decide when they retire
their judges is a major shift of power from the states,'' said Gray.
   Thomas Lehner, the state court administrator, said he had not
seen the decision and would not comment until he had.
   At issue was whether a federal law _ the federal Age
Discrimination and Employment Act _ applied to appointed state
judges. The law prohibits age discrimination against most employees.
   The state of Vermont argued first that judges fit one of the
exceptions _ ``appointees on the policymaking level'' _ and second
that Congress should not tell states how to set up their courts.
   On the first argument, the appeals court said appointed state
judges do not fall under the exception. ``Congress meant to deny
ADEA protection only to such appointees as would normally work
closely with and be accountable to the official who appointed
them,'' the judges said.
   On the second argument, the judges said Vermont had failed to
show the federal law improperly trampled on the rights of the
states. ``There is no suggestion that Congress surreptitiously
enacted any legislation without notice to the state of Vermont,''
the court said.
   The decision by the New York-based 2nd Circuit counters rulings
by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the St.
Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Those federal
appeals courts upheld state mandatory retirement provisions.
   Peck was appointed to the Vermont Supreme Court in 1981. His
current term expires in 1993. He turned 70 on Dec. 24, 1988,
prompting Lehner to place him on retirement status, effective June
30, 1989, and prompting Peck to file an age discrimination
complaint with the EEOC, which filed suit on his behalf. Last July,
U.S. District Judge Lee Gagliardi sided with Peck, prompting the
appeal by the state to the 2nd Circuit.
   The Vermont Supreme Court has five members. It is the only
appeals court in the state.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Declines Comment on Probe Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coast Guard officials said Monday they knew nothing
about a reported federal probe of drug corruption involving at
least 11 guardsmen.
   An NBC report Monday night said the corruption case was expected
to go to a federal grand jury soon. The report cited unnamed
sources as saying the case focused on a member of President Bush's
Coast Guard protection detail in Maine and an officer stationed in
Islamorada in the Florida Keys.
   ``We are trying to find out if there is such a thing,'' said Jim
Simpson, the press secretary for Admiral Paul Yost, the Coast Guard
commandant. ``All we have right now are NBC's allegations.''
   Federal authorities said the two unnamed guardsmen, along with
at least nine other present and former members of the Coast Guard,
are under investigation for selling classified information to
smugglers, NBC reported.
   Four members of the Coast Guard's Islamorada station were
convicted in 1988 on drug charges involving four kilos of cocaine
they allegedly seized in waters off Florida and sold to an
undercover agent in North Carolina, the Coast Guard said.
   Art Sola, Jeffrey Mey, Steven Vanheuson and James Weiss have
been in prison since then, and Coast Guard officials said the case
was closed, Simpson said.
   ``We knew about the guys who've been convicted, but as far as
any pending cases, Admiral Yost was not aware of them,'' Simpson
said. ``If they have evidence, they should bring an indictment and
put guys in jail instead of leaking it through the press.''
   Sources cited by NBC say the new indictments would be handed up
as part of phase two of ``Operation Tempest.''

<HEAD>McClatchy Newspapers Sees Falling Ad Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Responding to a 51 percent decline in
earnings during the first quarter, McClatchy Newspapers Inc. says
it is braced for more potential bad news this year and is cutting
costs.
   Officials at the company's annual meeting May 16 blamed the
decline on falling ad sales for newspapers across the country.
   Retail ad linage ``softened dramatically in March at most of our
papers as it did throughout most of the country and resulted in a
very disappointing first quarter,'' said Erwin Potts, president and
chief executive officer of the company, which publishes The
Sacramento Bee and 18 other newspapers in four states.
   Treasurer James P. Smith said net first-quarter income fell from
$4.8 million in 1989 to $2.4 million in 1990.
   Smith also attributed the lower profits in part to interest
expense from McClatchy's recent purchase of several South Carolina
papers and on start-up costs for a newsprint mill in Washington
state.
   ``We may yet take some tough hits before 1990 is over,'' said
Potts, if ad linage remains low. ``We expect that things will
rebound, if not later this year, then certainly next year.''
   On the positive side, Potts said circulation has continued to
grow in the past five years at all McClatchy's major papers but
one, which is in an area of Washington state hurt financially by
the shutdown of a nuclear power plant.
   The Sacramento Bee led the circulation growth last year, with
daily circulation up 5.3 percent and Sunday up 5.2 percent.
   For McClatchy Newspapers, revenues totaled $381 million in 1989,
up 7 percent from the previous year, Smith said. Advertising
revenues totaled $303 million and circulation revenues $63 million,
he said.
   Net income totaled $34 million, up from $29 million in 1988 and
representing a 31 percent increase over the past four years, Smith
said.
   The company on Wednesday declared a regular quarterly cash
dividend of 4 cents per share, payable July 3, 1990.

<HEAD>J. Stewart Bryan III Elected Media General Board Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J. Stewart Bryan III, whose family started
in the newspaper business in Richmond 140 years ago, was chosen May
18 to succeed his father as board chairman of Media General Inc.
   The board of directors also elected him president and chief
executive officer, replacing James S. Evans, who was elected vice
chairman. Bryan is also a member of the board of directors of The
Associated Press.
   His father, D. Tennant Bryan, 83, will become chairman of the
Media General board's executive committee.
   Media General is the parent company of Richmond Newspapers Inc.,
which publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News
Leader.
   Media General also owns the Winston-Salem Journal in North
Carolina and the Tampa Tribune in Florida; three television
stations, two cable television companies and a 40 percent stake in
the New Jersey-based Garden State Newspapers.
   Under Evans' direction, the company has trimmed its holdings
under a restructuring plan to focus on its core East Coast media
interests. One of the biggest changes was the sale last year of two
groups of community weekly newspapers in Los Angeles and Orange
counties in California.
   Stewart Bryan said the industry has been in the doldrums but
that earnings would be ``robust'' this year. He would not give an
estimate.
   Bryan also said the company expects near-term growth will be
internal and that no major acquisitions are envisioned.

<HEAD>New Kansas City Newspaper Hits the Streets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sole investor in Kansas City's
new afternoon newspaper says he hopes to buck a national trend and
attract enough readers for a profit. Analysts say that's going to
be tough.
   The first edition of The Kansas City Evening News rolled off the
press May 14.
   Steve Rose, president of a family-owned chain of 18 suburban
weekly papers and owner of the new 50-cent tabloid, said the paper
sold about 22,800 copies its first day.
   Media analysts contend the newspaper will face tough times
because of a general decline in advertising revenues.
   Rose said he can make a profit through low costs, small
circulation and street sales. The newspaper will not be delivered
to homes.
   He said he's not trying to compete directly with The Kansas City
Star, a morning paper with daily circulation of 297,000.
   Rose said he got the idea for a newspaper in March, when the
Kansas City Star Co. stopped publishing an afternoon edition and
merged it with the morning newspaper after years of declining
afternoon circulation.
   ``I don't want and I don't need 50,000 to 100,000 readers,''
Rose said. ``If we start down that path, suddenly all the economies
change. That's exactly where Ralph Ingersoll ended up.''
   Ingersoll started the tabloid St. Louis Sun to compete with The
St. Louis Post-Dispatch for morning readers, but the Sun shut down
last month after only seven months. Ingersoll cited home-delivery
costs and inadequate street sales.
   Rose's newspaper, unlike the much larger St. Louis Sun, has an
editorial staff of four. It will consist mostly of news from wire
services.
   The Monday-through-Friday paper shares a press, building and
other equipment with Rose's weeklies. Startup costs have been under
$1 million, he said.
   Ken Berents, an analyst for Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in New York,
said starting a new newspaper in a town with a monopoly newspaper
like Kansas City is like ``running uphill'' with ankle weights on.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down Judge's Order Restricting Reporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIERRE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court ruled May 17 that a
circuit judge acted illegally when he restricted reporters covering
a trial stemming from an alleged rape at the South Dakota
governor's mansion.
   The high court said in a unanimous decision that Circuit Judge
Marshall Young of Rapid City must rescind his order. Young had
threatened reporters with arrest if they published the names of
people involved in the March trial of two juveniles.
   Gov. George Mickelson has acknowledged that his son, David, was
one of the two.
   Young's order was illegal because he failed to hold a hearing
before issuing it, made it too broad and required law enforcement
officers to enforce possible violations of the order, the Supreme
Court said.
   However, the justices declined to rule on the constitutionality
of the state law on which the circuit judge's order was based.
   The Sioux Falls Argus Leader and The Associated Press had argued
that the law, which prohibits the publication of names of people
involved in juvenile court proceedings, was an unconstitutional
prior restraint on the news media's right to publish lawfully
obtained information.
   Young presided over a closed-door trial of two 17-year-old boys
charged with sex offenses in connection with a Nov. 28 incident at
the governor's mansion. After the two-day trial, the judge
acquitted one boy of non-forcible rape and acquitted the other of
aiding and abetting rape.
   The two boys and a third 17-year-old admitted to charges of
underage drinking and were given probation and ordered to do
community work. Young also ordered that the two boys who had been
charged with sex offenses must each pay one-half the medical
expenses of the alleged rape victim, a 16-year-old girl.

<HEAD>Gannett Foundation Reports Interest in Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gannett Foundation said May 14 it has had
``numerous expressions of interest'' from potential buyers since
announcing it was exploring the sale of its 10 percent stake in
media giant Gannett Co. Inc.
   The foundation has hired the investment banking firm Salomon
Brothers Inc. to negotiate the possible sale of its 15.94 million
shares of Gannett stock.
   The foundation's chairman, retired Gannett Co. Chairman Allen H.
Neuharth, and its chief executive, Charles L. Overby, have said
they prefer to sell the stock to the company or to an employee
stock-option plan.
   ``But we have had numerous expressions of interest from other
potential buyers and Salomon will explore all of those,'' they said
in a statement.
   The foundation is Gannett's largest shareholder. Both are
located in Arlington, Va. The proposed sale of the stake has raised
questions about whether the newspaper, outdoor advertising and
broadcasting company has been put into play as a possible takeover
target.
   The foundation said it was considering selling its stake because
it had to seek higher income than paid by common stock dividends to
meet the obligation imposed on foundations to pay out 5 percent of
their assets annually.
   It had assets of nearly $650 million at the end of last year and
spent $30 million on grants for journalism education, adult
literacy, community projects and other philanthropic programs.
   Gannett Co. earned $397.5 million, or $2.47 share, on revenue of
$3.52 billion in 1989.
   It owns USA Today and 82 other daily newspapers, 52 non-daily
publications, 10 television stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett
News Services and the largest outdoor advertising company in North
America.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Overturns $785,000 Libel Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Supreme Court overturned a
$785,000 damages award to a county attorney, saying a newspaper did
not libel him by publishing statements that were true but implied
wrongdoing.
   The May 11 decision reversed a 1989 state Court of Appeals
ruling against the Duluth News-Tribune.
   At issue were three articles published by the newspaper in 1981
about Carlton County Attorney Carlton Diesen's performance in
prosecuting domestic abuse cases.
   Diesen said the articles ruined his reputation, caused him
extreme embarrassment and cost him re-election. He sued the
newspaper, its executive editor at the time and the reporter who
wrote the articles.
   A St. Louis County District Court jury awarded Diesen $285,000
in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.
   In dismissing the action, the Supreme Court said that Diesen had
not proved actual malice on the part of the newspaper.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Orders Injunction Against Reuters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ordered an injunction
May 17 preventing Reuters from backing out of a photo-exchange
agreement with United Press International.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in reversing a lower
court's decision, said UPI had shown that it would suffer
irreparable harm if the arrangement were discontinued.
   The request for the injunction stemmed from a counterclaim by
UPI to a Reuters lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange.
   In March, U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure denied the order
and UPI appealed.
   Three judges of the appeals court reversed Leisure and directed
him to issue the injunction, which would remain in effect until the
lawsuits are resolved.
   The picture-exchange contract was made in 1984 and called for
UPI to supply Reuters with photographs from the United States and
for Reuters to provide UPI with pictures from other countries. The
agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985.
   Reuters claimed the agreement is not living up to its
expectations. UPI said it would lose clients and possibly go out of
business without foreign photos from Reuters.

<HEAD>Bill Requiring Editorialists To Disclose Finances Appears Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill that would require Florida
editorial writers to disclose their finances appears to be dead,
although the sponsor may make a last-ditch effort to salvage it.
   Some lawmakers thought the measure, sponsored in the House by
Orlando Republican Bruce McEwan, was nothing more than a shot at
the press.
   ``As much as I might want to get in there and make a little jab
at editorial boards, I think the greater freedom of expression is
more important,'' said Rep. John Cosgrove, D-Miami.
   The bill would include newspaper editorial board members in a
current law requiring many state employees to file statements
disclosing their financial interests or face a $5,000 fine. It
would also require all editorials to be signed by the authors.
   The bill drew widespread interest from newspaper executives
across the country who saw it as one of the most blatant attempts
at press-bashing in recent memory, said Dick Shelton, executive
director of the Florida Press Association.
   ``We felt they (legislators) were peeved at the press and wanted
to get the press' attention,'' Shelton said. ``I think the
attention they got was dismay that our legislators would consider
something so obviously unconstitutional.''
   The measure narrowly won approval in early May in a House
subcommittee. But McEwan was unable to convince the Judiciary
Committee to forward it onto the floor.

<HEAD>Public Works Director, 2 Others Lose Libel Suit Against Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAREDO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city public works director and two
other men lost a $1.5 million libel suit against the Laredo Morning
Times on May 11.
   A state District Court jury concluded that the reputation of
public works director Joe Guerra was damaged in the first of four
Times articles about a candidate's claim that city equipment was
used improperly.
   But the jury awarded no damages, holding that the offending
article did not constitute ``actual malice.'' Nor did the newspaper
act ``with reckless disregard for the truth,'' the jury said.
   Guerra, Felix de Leon and Guadalupe F. Gonzalez sued the Times
and one of its editors in connection with articles published Oct.
17-20, 1985.
   The jury found that all four articles were substantially true
and the subject was of public concern.
   The Times contended that the first article merely reported what
occurred at a news conference the previous day, when mayoral
candidate Victor Solis alleged that a road grader was used to grade
the parking lot of a night club as a political favor to the
incumbent mayor and two others.
   De Leon was identified in the first article as the owner of the
property where the improvements were made. Gonzalez actually owned
the property.
   The jury found that three followup articles, in which Guerra and
other city officials denied the allegations, did not libel Guerra
and that none of the articles identified Gonzalez.

<HEAD>Discrimination Claim Settled for $65,000</HEAD>

   The Capital Times newspaper agreed May 11
to pay a former free-lance correspondent $65,000 to settle a
discrimination case shortly before the matter was to be heard by an
administrative law judge.
   Mary Patricia ``Patsy'' McGuire agreed to withdraw her
complaints that The Capital Times refused to hire her for reporting
positions four times because she was a woman and had an arthritic
handicap.
   McGuire filed her complaints in 1986 with the Equal Rights
Division of the state Department of Industry, Labor, and Human
Relations.
   Both sides were scheduled for hearings beginning on May 15
before an administrative law judge, who was to consider three of
the four claims.
   ``We negotiated back and forth and arrived at a settlement of
$65,000 for personal damages,'' said Michael Fox, McGuire's
attorney. ``It is a straight monetary settlement. There is no
admission of right and wrong on either side.''
   Capital Times Editor Dave Zweifel said the newspaper had hired
those it believed to be most qualified.
   ``I'm very disappointed the case was ever brought. Sometimes in
a case like this, it's just better to settle,'' he said.
   McGuire had written freelance articles for the newspaper for
four years. She suffered from a crippling form of arthritis but had
surgery that gave her mobility, Fox said.

<HEAD>Mohawk Editor Charged With Murder in Reservation Violence</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SALABERRY-DE-VALLEYFIELD, Quebec (AP) _ A Mohawk newspaper
editor was charged May 14 with murdering a fellow Indian in a gun
battle over casino gambling on the St. Regis Indian Reservation.
   Doug George, an outspoken, 35-year-old opponent of gambling, was
charged in Quebec Provincial Court in the May 1 slaying of Harold
Edwards, 31.
   The slaying of Edwards and another Mohawk the same day prompted
hundreds of New York and Canadian police to break with their
hands-off policy toward Indian matters and enter the 28,000-acre
reservation to keep the peace.
   George was being held without bail on a charge of second-degree
murder, which carries a life sentence with parole eligibility in 10
years.
   George, managing editor of two newspapers on the St. Regis
Indian Reservation, the Indian Times and Akwesasne Notes, regularly
used the papers to tout his anti-gambling views.

   Vietnam released an American publisher
May 14 after detaining him for three weeks for unknown reasons, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said.
   Mike Morrow arrived in Bangkok from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City,
said Jim Williams, the embassy spokesman. He had no other details,
and Morrow could not be reached immediately.
   Friends said Morrow was in Vietnam looking into investment
possibilities. They said he was arrested April 23 in the central
city of Da Nang, then taken to Ho Chi Minh City. A companion who
was also arrested, French businessman Terry Rodzynk, was released
earlier.
   The Vietnamese government has not revealed the reasons for the
arrests.
   An American who said she was recently detained for five days in
Vietnam said Morrow may have been held because of contacts with
dissidents in the country. The American, who said the reason for
her detention was never made clear, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Morrow started a private news service in Vietnam during the
Vietnam War. He was held briefly by Communist forces during the war.
   A longtime resident of Hong Kong, Morrow is the publisher of
Petroleum News, an industry journal. He also heads Asia 2000 Ltd.,
a publishing house, and a trading company in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
   A judge froze the assets of a former print
shop worker and a stockbroker after they were convicted May 16 on
insider trading charges for scooping tips from Business Week before
the magazine hit the newsstands.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson ordered the assets frozen
after a jury convicted William N. Jackson, 34, of Long Beach and
Brian Callahan, 30, of Anaheim on the charges.
   Jackson, a former quality control analyst at a printing firm,
could be fined up to $80,000 for his part in the insider trading
scheme, prosecutors said. Callahan, a former Prudential-Bache
broker, faces a maximum fine of $110,000.
   The two men traded in 53 stocks between 1987 and 1988 using
information gleaned from Business Week. Jackson made more than
$19,000 for himself and two brothers, and Callahan made the same
amount for himself and his clients plus $8,000 in commissions, the
government alleged.
   Jackson reviewed a freshly printed copy of Business Week each
Wednesday night, then phoned Callahan the next morning to buy
stocks recommended in the ``Inside Wall Street'' column,
prosecutors said.
   The magazine, though printed on Wednesday nights, does not reach
newsstands until Thursday evening.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it would seek all
profits, plus interest, and triple that amount in penalties.
   The men's attorney, Joseph Connolly, argued the SEC was
``stretching the securities laws almost beyond recognition'' and
called the violations marginal.
   ``These are a couple of guys who lost their jobs,' he said.
``They're not wealthy, either of them.''
   Jackson acknowledged he bought stock, but testified he didn't
realize he was breaking the law or confidentiality requirements of
his company, R.R. Donnelley and Sons of Torrance.
   Callahan testified he believed Jackson got his tips from a
computer program.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several of Tokyo's largest newspapers said May 17
they held up ads by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens, who is battling
for control of a Japanese company.
   The ads claim that collusive business practices force higher
prices on Japanese consumers. The papers said they were considering
printing a version that does not name the Japanese companies
Pickens believes to be at fault.
   ``There's no freedom of speech in Japan,'' said Pickens' lawyer,
Kanji Ishizumi. ``Toyota published an ad in a U.S. paper saying
`shut up' to Pickens. They were able to enjoy freedom of speech in
the United States, but Pickens can't do that here.''
   Pickens issued a statement May 16 in Texas claiming Toyota and
its powerful advertising agency, Dentsu, were trying to block him
from publishing the ads.
   Since last year, Boone Co., a U.S. investment firm, has held the
largest equity stake in Koito Manufacturing Co., a major automobile
parts maker closely linked to Toyota, Japan's largest automaker.
   Pickens says his unsuccessful battle to gain a seat on Koito's
board of directors and to exercise leadership in the company
illustrates how investment opportunities are closed to foreigners
in Japan.

<HEAD>Florida's High Court: Reporters Don't Have Privilege in Eyewitness
Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The First Amendment doesn't exempt
reporters from the obligation of testifying about crimes they
witness, Florida's Supreme Court said in rejecting an appeal by The
Miami Herald.
   ``While we are mindful of the importance of a vigorous and
aggressive press, we fail to see how compelling a reporter to
testify concerning his eyewitness observations of a relevant event
in a criminal proceeding in any way `chills' or impinges on the
newsgathering process,'' Justice Parker Lee McDonald wrote for the
majority.
   The Herald, Florida's largest newspaper, hasn't decided if it
will appeal the May 17 decision, said attorney Samuel Terilli Jr.
He said the ruling would have a limited impact because it was
written to cover only a narrow, specific set of circumstances.
   ``It applies only to reporters who have eyewitnessed crimes,
searches and similar events in criminal cases, and that just
doesn't happen too often,'' Terilli said.
   Reporter Joel Achenbach was subpoenaed by an attorney for a New
York man arrested on drug smuggling charges at the Miami
International Airport. Achenbach was accompanying three Metro-Dade
police officers at the time as part of his research for an article.
   Details of the search and arrest in Achenbach's story differed
from police reports.
   A state trial court and Florida's 3rd District Court of Appeal
rejected the Herald's argument that the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution extended to Achenbach a qualified privilege to refuse
to divulge information obtained first-hand as a witness to an event
in a criminal case.

<HEAD>School Disciplines Students on Alternative Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 people staged a protest rally at
Wheaton College May 15 after nine students were disciplined for
alleged obscenity and sexual references in an underground newspaper.
   But J. Richard Chase, president of the evangelical Christian
college, said the school would be guided by biblical principles.
   ``There are limits to what we will have on our campus,'' Chase
said. ``We believe there are biblical standards. We believe in a
civil society.''
   The Icecream Socialist was formed to provide an alternative to
the school's official paper, students said.
   But when the paper published a poem alleged to include sexual
innuendo and a stream-of-consciousness piece that included
obscenities, college officials intervened.
   One student involved in the paper quit rather than be expelled,
two students who worked on the paper were suspended for a semester,
five others have been placed on probation and one student, a
graduating senior, received a warning.
   Some of the nine questioned why they were disciplined, since
they had issued a public apology. Chase said if action hadn't been
taken, others would have gotten the message, ``Do whatever you
want, (then) send an apology.''

<HEAD>Ombudsmen Not Always Popular With Colleagues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reporters and editors at The Orange
County Register in Santa Ana, Calif., tend to avoid Pat Riley. As
the paper's ombudsman, Riley's Sunday column often outlines his
colleagues' mistakes.
   ``Writing a column means you have a less pleasant relationship
with the staff because you have to put someone's name in the
column,'' Riley said May 14 as the Organization of News Ombudsmen's
conference opened.
   Henry McNulty of The Hartford (Conn.) Courant said the group's
intials, ONO, reflect the attitude of colleagues when they see an
ombudsman coming: ``Oh, no. What have I done now?'' said McNulty.
   ``The readers are quite sophisticated about the media and they
are quick to point out errors or biases,'' said Charles Bond of The
Palm Beach Post in West Palm Beach, Fla.
   Kerry Sipe of The Virginian-Pilot said newspapers are following
the trend of responsiveness to the consumer. ``Just as an oil
company is held responsible by the consumer for its oil spills, so
a newspaper is asked to take responsibility for what it does and
clean up after itself when it errs,'' he said.
   Riley said most of the Register's staff treat the matter
professionally. ``We criticize everybody else in the world, and I
think the staff _ though they're not always pleased _ realizes we
have to be subject to the same criticism,'' he said.
   The ombudsmen agreed there are some issues, such as abortion, on
which they have no easy answers. McNulty said he gets about the
same number of complaints from pro-life advocates as from
pro-choice advocates claiming a story was biased against them.
   ``We listen. But at the same time, we don't let those criticisms
dampen or curtail our coverage. We still consider ourselves news
people. We will still cover the stories,'' Riley said.
   ``There are no solutions to some complaints about stories. But
what is important is that there is a two-way communication between
the reader and the newspaper. With that comes the hope that the
paper is hearing what the reader is saying,'' McNulty said.

<HEAD>New Jersey Newspaper Bans Rev. Al Sharpton Quotes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASSAIC, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The North Jersey Herald &amp; News announced
May 15 it would no longer publish comments by the Rev. Al Sharpton,
calling him ``a reverend of racism and a minister of hate.''
   The newspaper's five-member editorial board unanimously agreed
not to print Sharpton comments unless they are newsworthy, said
Thomas Benner, editorial page editor.
   Benner said the editorial board acted partly because of a recent
appeal by New York Mayor David N. Dinkins for racial healing.
   The newspaper also banned using Sharpton statements a couple of
years ago during the newspaper's coverage of Tawana Brawley, a
15-year-old black girl who alleged she was raped by white men in
Wappingers Falls, N.Y. Sharpton became her adviser and a family
spokesman in the case. A grand jury eventually said Brawley's story
was false.
   Sharpton is serving as adviser to the family of Yusuf Hawkins, a
black youth allegedly shot to death by white teen-agers in
Brooklyn, N.Y.
   A jury on May 17 found Joseph Fama of Brooklyn guilty of
second-degree murder and 12 other counts in the killing.

<HEAD>Banned Journalist Free To Return to South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Journalist Donald Woods, whose
book on a South African black activist was made into the movie
``Cry Freedom,'' is free to return to South Africa after being
banned for years, his former newspaper said May 20.
   The East London Daily Dispatch, where Woods was the editor in
the 1970s, said it had received a letter from President F.W. de
Klerk saying there were no restrictions or pending charges against
Woods.
   ``There really does seem to be a new spirit in South Africa, and
I'm greatly looking forward forward to coming back to experience it
for myself,'' Woods told his former newspaper in an interview from
London.
   Woods befriended Steve Biko before the black activist's death in
police custody in September 1977. A month later, Woods was placed
under a banning order that prevented him from working as a
journalist in South Africa.
   It was illegal for the media to quote Woods in South Africa
until February, when de Klerk announced a series of reforms lifting
restrictions on banned people.
   Woods and his family fled South Africa in 1978 and have been
living in London ever since.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Destroy Press Freedom in Medellin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug war has hit close to home at
El Espectador, a daily newspaper in Bogota and outspoken foe of the
cocaine barons.
   Seven Espectador employees have been killed in eight months in
Medellin, the home base of the Colombian drug cartel, and the paper
no longer circulates here.
   The reprisals made many people afraid to be seen seen with
copies of the newspaper. News vendors kept it out of sight and
slipped copies to customers surreptitiously. Newsboys quit selling
it in the streets.
   El Espectador, which means The Spectator, is Colombia's
second-largest newspaper, after El Tiempo of Bogota.
   Medellin's two newspapers, El Mundo and El Colombiano, have
printed less about the drug war since the terrorism campaign began.
   A reporter, who feared to let his name be used, said El
Espectador's fate in Medellin probably would be repeated in other
cities, and ``the traffickers will not quit until they destroy El
Espectador.''
   ``This is the most dramatic and successful attack on press
freedom I have ever heard of,'' he said. ``In other countries, you
might get killed for what you write, but here they murder you just
for working.''
   Police posted a half-dozen officers at the Medellin offices
after the assassinations Oct. 10 of El Espectador's manager in the
city, Martha Luz Lopez, and its chief of distribution, Miguel Soler.
   They told employees to lock themselves in. Telephone callers
gave the staff three days to quit their jobs.
   In November, the employees finally did quit, but El Espectador
continued circulating in Medellin until April, when traffickers
murdered Gustavo Tabera, one of the men in charge of distribution.
   El Espectador announced after the murder that the paper no
longer would circulate in Antioquia state and its capital, Medellin.
   Antioquia state provided 30 percent of El Espectador's
classified advertising, but the economic loss was minor compared to
the loss of prestige.
   Although the paper's main office now is in Bogota, it was
founded in Medellin in 1887 by Fidel Cano. His descendents still
run it. The Medellin cartel has said it will kill members of the
family as part of a campaign of violence against the government of
President Virgilio Barco.

<HEAD>Outdoor Writers Rescue Two Cubans at Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMORADA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four outdoor writers interrupted their
fishing off the Florida Keys on May 14 to rescue two Cuban refugees
on a makeshift raft.
   ``Their hands and feets were like prunes, they were trembling,
but they were really happy to see us,'' said Don Mann, one of 160
writers attending a meeting of the Florida Outdoor Writers
Association this week.
   The Cubans, ages 21 and 22, had been at sea five days, Mann
said. They still had five cans of Russian-labeled food but had run
out of water May 12.
   ``They kept shouting `Estados Unidos, Estados Unidos.' And when
we told them they were near the United States, they were
ecstatic,'' said Mann, a contributing editor for Florida Sportsman
magazine.
   The refugees were picked up 18 miles south of Islamorada. Their
raft comprised three truck innertubes and a couple of wooden
planks, Mann said.
   While the writers waited for instructions from the Coast Guard,
Mann caught a 25-pound dolphin fish.
   The Cubans were turned over to the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.

<HEAD>Study Finds `MacNeil-Lehrer' More Conservative Than `Nightline'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public television's ``The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' features more whites and males and is more
government-oriented and conservative than ABC's ``Nightline,'' says
a group that studied both shows.
   The assertion was made by a liberal media watchdog group,
Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting, in a study released May 20. FAIR
president Jeff Cohen said the PBS show has a ``narrow,
pro-establishment guest list'' that ``mocks the original mandate of
public television'' to provide diversity.
   ``NewsHour'' executive producer Les Crystal said the news
program agrees that diversity is important ``and we clearly feel we
can and should do better in that regard.''
   But he disputed what he called FAIR's contention that the show
doesn't criticize the government much and asks one-sided questions.
   The FAIR study of ``NewsHour'' broadcasts from Feb. 6 to Aug. 4,
1989, was conducted by Boston College sociologists William Hoynes
and David Croteau, who made a study critical of ``Nightline'' last
year.
   The ``Nightline''' report, examining 40 months of the ABC
program from 1985 to 1988, found that 89 percent of its guests were
men, 92 percent were white, and that conservative leaders were the
show's most frequent guests.
   FAIR's new study, entitled ``All the Usual Suspects:
MacNeil-Lehrer and Nightline,'' also compared ABC's program with
``NewsHour'' during the same six-month period the latter was
studied.
   The two professors making the study found that ABC's show has
slightly broadened its guest list since the original study, but
that ``our hopes for significant change were not met.''
   Their ``NewsHour'' study found that of U.S. citizens appearing
as guests, 90 percent of them were white and 87 percent were male.
The figures rose on programs about international politics, it said,
with 94 percent of U.S. citizens appearing to discuss world
politics being both white and male.
   The study offered no racial or gender percentages for guests who
were not U.S. citizens.
   It characterized as ``more representative'' the guests invited
when the show's topic was domestic politics. It said that 26
percent of them were women, but gave no figures on the race of
female guests.
   FAIR's study said the show's guest list was dominated by two
conservative Washington think tanks, with a total of 14 guests
provided by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and
the American Enterprise Institute.

<HEAD>Broadcasters Ask That Cameras Be Allowed in Trial Courts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News organizations asked the Illinois
Supreme Court on May 18 to allow cameras and microphones in the
state's trial courts.
   ``The best way for the public to have confidence in its judicial
system is to see what's going on,'' said Richard Thies, an attorney
for Illinois News Broadcasters Association, one of the petitioners.
   Before 1984, cameras and microphones weren't allowed in any
state courts, but that year the Supreme Court opened the doors of
appellate courts.
   The justices decided to keep cameras and microphones out of the
trial courts because of fears ``that miscarriages of justice will
result from the subtle, insidious effect that televising trials
will have upon the behavior of the participants in court
proceedings,'' former Justice Robert Underwood wrote at the time.
   When that decision was made, 30 states allowed cameras and
microphones in trial courts. Now, 37 states allow cameras and
microphones in trial courts, and Thies said the experience of those
states has shown camera coverage doesn't affect the outcome of
trials.
   ``Electronic coverage of trials would help guarantee due process
by encouraging public scrutiny of trials, thus acting as a direct
check on abuse of the judicial process,'' he wrote in the brief
submitted to the high court.
   Thies said news organizations are hoping the Supreme Court will
adopt a rule similar to New York's test program.
   The New York rule allows microphones and cameras in trial courts
but prohibits taping of rape victims, jurors and undercover
officers. It also prohibits audio coverage of conferences among
attorneys, clients and the judge.
   Thies said he didn't expect the court to rule on his request
before next year.
   Other petitioners are WLS Television Inc., WMAQ-TV, the Illinois
Broadcasters Association, the Illinois Press Photographers
Association and the Illinois Freedom of Information Council.

<HEAD>Suit Over `Non-Competing Station' Clause Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former television anchorman has settled a
lawsuit that he filed against the station for barring him from
joining any competing Milwaukee TV station.
   Mike Miller, formerly employed by WITI-TV, asked in the Circuit
Court suit that the contract provision prohibiting work for a
competing station be ruled void.
   Judge Gary A. Gerlach indicated at an earlier hearing that he
likely would rule the provision was too broad.
   ``I'm just heaving a sigh of relief,'' Miller, 38, said May 15.
``It's unusual for them to want to settle. I guess they could see
the writing on the wall in our case. Now I can get on with things.''
   Miller left the station in mid-March after being asked to accept
a new contract cutting his pay from $75,000 a year to $68,000.
   WITI attorney Franklyn M. Gimbel confirmed the settlement, which
contained no admission of liability by WITI.
   William M. Cannon, Miller's attorney, said part of the
settlement was confidential. He would not disclose whether Miller
will receive any money.
   Miller said he planned to notify other Milwaukee stations he was
available.
   Still pending is a suit filed against WITI over the same issue
by former reporter Scott Feldmeyer.
   That case is before the state Court of Appeals, which has ruled
Feldmeyer is free to work at a competing station until a decision
is issued.

   Yehuda Lisky, editor of the last Yiddish newspaper
in Britain, is dead at 90, The Daily Telegraph reported May 21.
   Lisky was born in Oszene, Poland, and as a young man traveled to
Vienna to live with his brother Abraham Fuchs, an established
Yiddish writer.
   He came to London in 1930 and worked on a Yiddish daily, Die
Zeit. When it folded in 1950, Lisky started his own paper, Dos
Yiddishe Folk (The Jewish People), in collaboration with poet Avron
Stencl.
   It was published first weekly, then biweekly, then monthly and
finally whenever he had the money and energy to produce it.
   Yiddish was the common language of East European Jewry. It
largely disappeared following the Nazi persecution of World War II
and the dying out of the older generation of survivors.
   The Daily Telegraph said Lisky's wife, Sonia, died in 1984. They
are survived by two sons.

Associated Press, has won two 1989 Peter Lisagor Awards for
Exemplary Journalism.
   Her four-day series ``The Changing Heartland'' was recognized in
the reporting category for news bureaus or wire services.
   The stories examined why Japanese auto plants are moving to
small towns in the Midwest, the turnaround in the steel industry
and its impact on Gary, Ind., the growth of a supercomputer
corridor in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and the rebounding of the Iowa
economy.
   The second award, in the business journalism category for news
bureaus or wire services, was for a three-part package, ``Danger at
Work.'' The series looked at the impact of increased productivity
on workplace injuries, five families who turned activist after
their sons were killed in on-the-job accidents, and efforts by
states to pursue criminal charges against corporate officials in
work accidents.
   The annual awards, presented May 10 this year, are presented by
the Chicago Headline Club, a chapter of the Society of Professional
Journalists. They are named after the late Chicago Daily News
correspondent Peter Lisagor.
   Ms. Cohen also won Lisagor awards in 1988 and 1989.

   The first photo series from the Hubble
Space Telescope was supposed to be just an engineering test, but it
surprised scientists by revealing an unsuspected double star.
   Hubble's inaugural photo sequence, taken from its orbit 381
miles above the Earth, showed bright, crisp stars against a black
background, with much clearer images than seen in a picture taken
by a ground-based telescope of the same part of the heavens.
   ``Fantastic,'' James Westphal, the principal scientist for the
camera used in the first photo exercise, said Sunday. ``We are just
as pleased as punch at this point. Our image is significantly
better than we were concerned that it might be.''
   Westphal said the Hubble pictures clearly show that an image
which appeared in ground-based photos to be only a single star was,
in fact, a rare binary star. The space telescope pictures showed
two overlapping points of light, instead of a single blob as seen
in a picture taken by a Chilean observatory.

   Other people's smoke is a proven cause of heart
disease in non-smokers, raising their risk of dying from the
disease by up to 30 percent, a study says.
   In a presentation in Boston at the World Conference on Lung
Health, Stanton Glantz of the University of California, San
Francisco, said research is beginning to show exactly how cigarette
smoke alters the heart, blood and arteries. He presented a study in
which he reviewed others' research on the subject.
   In 1986, the Surgeon General concluded in his annual report on
smoking and health that so-called passive smoking causes lung
cancer in non-smokers. At that time, the evidence was insufficient
to link passive smoking with heart disease, the report said.
   Newer studies have changed that, Glantz said Friday in a
telephone interview.

   Los Angeles lagged behind other big cities in
federal narcotics charges when Robert Bonner, now President Bush's
choice to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, was U.S.
attorney there, court records show.
   Although the city regularly was near the top in the nation in
federal drug arrests, it ranked far lower in the percentage of
federal defendants charged with drug offenses during Bonner's
tenure.
   Throughout the period, the most common federal criminal charges
in the nation were drug-related, but in Los Angeles the most common
were fraud and embezzlement, according to a recent analysis of
court records by a Syracuse University research group.
   The study shows that Bonner's office brought a smaller
percentage of drug charges than the national average for U.S.
attorneys. Furthermore, he lagged behind a number of colleagues in
big cities that had fewer drug arrests to begin with.

<HEAD>Budget Deal Could Be an Asset for Bush</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's budget summit scenario points
up a problem the Democrats could encounter after the negotiations
on debt and taxes _ if and when there is a deal to curb the
deficit, it will bear the presidential seal.
   Despite the clamor over the president's easing of his ban
against new taxes, a settlement could turn out to be an asset for
the White House. Democrats have been arguing all year that
unrealistic assumptions in the administration budget would lead to
a mid-year deficit crunch with a threat of automatic spending cuts
that would cripple federal programs next fall, just before the
elections.
   That, and the soaring, unbudgeted cost of the savings and loan
bailout, led to what Bush now calls an urgent problem, and to the
budget talks he convened. The negotiations resume today.
   It will take weeks, perhaps months, but those talks will produce
some sort of settlement because neither party can afford to led
them fail.
   A top administration official, assessing the prospect on
condition he not be identified by name, said politicians won't want
the issue loose during the fall election campaign, when positions
will harden and congressional challengers will demand to know what
incumbents are going to do about taxes and federal spending
programs.
   When there is a deal, Bush will preside over the announcement
session, sharing the platform with Democratic leaders, offering
thanks and praise, hailing their bipartisanship. For all that, the
president's voice is the one that counts politically.
   In the event that his voice overrules his lips and accepts new
taxes, it will be embarrassing. How embarrassing, and for how long,
will depend on the shape of the whole package. A true, long-term
compromise that really does cut deficits would be a plus for all
parties to the talks.
   There's also the question of what new taxes, what they would
cost, and who would pay. The administration official said that in a
$50 billion settlement that split deficit reduction between
spending cuts and new revenues, less than $5 billion in additional
taxes might be enough. He said the administration budget already
includes $19.4 billion in new revenues. The White House doesn't
call them taxes.
   But the Democrats are determined that he will, before this deal
is done.
   They had hoped to prod Bush into addressing the nation on the
budget crunch, worsened by slipping revenues and rising interest
rates, along with the savings and loan bailout. They argued that it
would be difficult to sell harsh budget measures to the voters
unless Bush made the case for action. At the first session in the
budget talks, last Tuesday, he declined to do so.
   He said later that there will be a time for prime time, but not
now. ``I want to go out when we have a bipartisan answer to the
problem, say here's what the problem is and here's ... the answer.
   ``I'm not going to go out there and try to do something that
might inadvertently suggest crisis and frighten markets,'' he told
a news conference.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on the Budget
Committee, said that in urging a nationally televised presidential
address on the budget problem, the Democrats were trying to push
Bush to do what Jimmy Carter did in what came to be known as his
malaise speech, a catalogue of troubles that dragged him down
politically.
   While Democrats would like hear Bush proposals, and have the
voters hear them, too, the president said that to make
recommendations in public would breach his promise that the
administration would bargain on the budget with no preconditions.
   That makes vagueness a virtue.
   Bush said he wasn't out to trick or blindside anybody. But he
told Democrats who challenged him to go first on proposing answers
to wait one minute _ Congress is responsible for appropriating
money and raising revenues.
   ``So let's not talk about going first _ we got a problem,'' he
said. ``I'm going to try to keep my share of the bargain by not
discussing what we might do or might not do, what my bottom line
is, what my opening wedge is.''
   Then, he said, quoting Lyndon B. Johnson, ``let's ... reason
together and try to get a deal.'' That should keep the Democrats
alert. They know that when LBJ reasoned his way to a deal, it
usually was on his terms.

<HEAD>NBC's ``Last Flight Out'' A Flawed Vietnam Drama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been 15 years since the fall of Saigon, and
still the movies about the war keep coming.
   Most are bad, a few are first-rate and some are well-intended
efforts that just don't hit the mark.
   The last would best describe ``Last Flight Out,'' an NBC movie
based on the real story of the last, refugee-packed Pan American
flight out of Saigon six days before the fall of the city and South
Vietnam to North Vietnamese forces.
   It stars Richard Crenna as Pan Am pilot Dan Hood and James Earl
Jones as Al Topping, the airline's Saigon station manager _ two men
who exist and who defied the rules in a good cause in the panicky
days near the end of the war.
   Their joint efforts got 463 people _ most of them Vietnamese
orphans, Pan Am's Vietnamese employees and endangered Vietnamese
who worked for the U.S. Embassy during the war _ on Pam Am's last
jumbo jet flight out of the country.
   An incredible story. Unfortunately, this filmed-in-Thailand
effort, airing tonight, seems oddly flat.
   Save for a few moments, it doesn't really convey the feeling of
urgency, confusion and panic that preceded the fall of Saigon.
   Even its scenes depicting the city's streets and marketplaces
seem unbelievably calm. You keep wondering if director Larry
Elikann studied news clips of Saigon in its last frenzied days to
see what it was like.
   Another big problem is that Walter Halsey Davis' script tries to
dovetail too many stories into two hours.
   In addition to the stories of Topping and Hood, there's also
that of Jim Eckes (Arliss Howard), a Continental Airlines employee
in Saigon who ran an unofficial evacuation effort.
   There's also Tra Duong (Rosalind Chao), a Vietnamese-born Pan Am
flight attendant trapped in Saigon while trying to get her family
out.
   That's crowded enough, but there's also a fictional U.S. State
Department type, Larry Rose (Eric Bogosian), flying back from
Washington on his own to help Vietnamese friends, low-level
employees of the United States in Saigon.
   The starting point for ``Last Flight Out'' is the flight into
Saigon of Rose and Hood.
   The latter is coming in to help a civilian doctor friend at the
American Hospital cope with a flood of orphans injured in the crash
of an Air Force C-5 jumbo jet during Operation Babylift, an effort
to evacuate 2,000 orphans.
   Amazingly, that crash, which killed more more than 75 orphans
and 50 Americans, is only vaguely mentioned in the movie. Such
vagueness happens elsewhere and is another major flaw of the movie.
   Despite some fine moments, particularly the Americans'
frustration with a Vietnamese bureaucrat who refuses to believe the
war is lost, ``Last Flight Out'' seems strangely disconnected from
the war it's trying to depict.
   And about the only actor who really makes an impression is
Howard, superb as a very compassionate man, albeit one so cynical
he'll say of the South Vietnamese officer corps as that country's
army collapses:
   ``I believe the current penalty for desertion is a life sentence
in Switzerland with a numbered account.''
   But you're never sure of exactly what Eckes does. Is he a pilot?
An executive? A mechanic? It's never made clear, and it seems
strange that no one noticed this before filming began.
   You have to give credit to to NBC and the sponsor, AT&amp;T, for
making the effort that led to ``Last Flight Out.''
   But the film just doesn't work. Too bad. It might have been
memorable had its maker done a little more homework and a whole lot
more plot-pruning.

<HEAD>Smaller Businesses Victimized Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So there really is a credit crunch, after all,
despite the Federal Reserve's earlier comment that it could find
none in its regular data.
   This crunch, however, seems not to be directly managed by the
Fed, whose job it is to regulate the flow of funds to the banks,
and therefore to the economy. It is managed instead by the banks
themselves.
   It is, you might say, a private-sector clampdown, one in which
the banks have funds available to them but aren't making funds
available to businesses, especially small ones and those involved
with commercial real estate.
   The information, from a survey by the Fed itself, tends to
resolve what had seemed to be a contradiction _ small businesses
complaining they couldn't get sufficient credit but the Fed
indicating it wasn't tightening the flow.
   Regardless of the source, business again feels it is victimized.
It makes no difference who is the source of their distress, the
Feds or the bankers, since the impact is the same.
   Operators of small businesses especially say it is an old story,
recalling that just a decade ago the prime lending rate rose to
21.5 percent for the very best corporate customers. For small
businesses it was more like 25 percent.
   That 1981 crunch was Federal Reserve-generated, and many
businesses, ranging from proprietorships to some with sales close
to $50 million a year, succumbed or were bought up. It was one of
the worst recessions ever.
   In fact, by some measures the early 1980s recession was the
deepest since the Great Depression of the 1930s, a debacle some
historians say was worsened when the Fed tightened up early in that
decade and loosened too late.
   Some business people still argue, in fact, that the double-digit
interest rates that developed in the late 1970s were due as much to
Fed miscalculation as to the robustness of business and consumer
spending.
   First, the critics say, the Fed allowed too much credit into the
economy, and then it clamped down with unnecessary harshness. But
inflation was roaring, and that meant higher interest rates were
required, they said.
   You still can't sell that argument to some Fed critics. They
contend that inflation then wasn't a result of consumer and
business demand straining the nation's capacity to produce. They
say it was Eurodollars.
   Eurodollars are U.S. dollars made abroad when Americans import
more than they export. European banks, which hold the dollars, make
dollar-denominated loans based on the dollars they have on deposit.
Dollars flood the world.
   The Fed, the critics say, restrained the U.S. economy by
limiting the ability of business to borrow, but the creation of
dollars by foreign banks was left unregulated. It was those
dollars, they say, that created inflation.
   Now the crackdown seems to be by the banks themselves, according
to the Fed survey. The Fed itself has not tightened up on the money
supply; in fact, it says, it decided not to raise interest rates at
a policy meeting in March.
   Why should the banks be cautious? That answer too is an old one:
Because they are worried, having made bad loans that must be worked
off the books _ foreign loans now essentially uncollectable, and
bad real estate loans.
   And smaller businesses, those not on the Fortune lists and most
of them not likely ever to be there, are feeling the pinch. Nothing
new in that either. Any small-business person can show you the
welts left by earlier crackdowns.
   It matters not whether it is the Federal Reserve or a
private-sector lender who does the whipping, the welts are the same
color.

   Beijing college students, who led the
pro-democracy movement last spring, say June 4 will be a difficult
day.
   For some, the empty bunk in their tiny, concrete dorm room will
remind them again of a roommate who was killed that day, arrested
soon afterward, or has fled the country or gone underground.
   The day will be even harder to get through because they cannot
show outward signs of mourning or hold memorial services for those
the government calls ``counterrevolutionaries.''
   In general, few people speak readily of ``thee
``6-4 incident,'' code words for the democracy movement and the
military crackdown a year ago.
   Most have simply put it behind them, saying they have to
continue with  turmoil'' or ththeir lives.
   ``But even if people don't realize the anniversary is
approaching, they'll know it just by the signs around them, like
all the extra police,'' a young intellectual said.
   Students say the day will not pass unmarked.
   ``We'll have some memorial activity _ individually, whatever
each person is able to do,'' a sophomore at Beijing University said.
   ``The present situation and environment doesn't allow us to take
any kind of action, but as long asgotten so excited about
anything,'' she said. ``Now there's nothing that can make me
excited or happy.''
   Almost no one believes anything will happen June 4.
   ``Students aren't going to make trouble just for the sake of
making trouble,'' a Beijing University senior said, but the
students also say many are ready to join another protest.
   ``Right now, the only thing that's lacking is a leader,'' one
said, ``but who would dare to be a leader?''

<TEXT>
   The sleek elevator at the Exchange Square
office tower begins its ascent with yet another group of people who
hope the short ride up is the start of a journey leading out.
   ``Twelve,'' a disembodied voice announces as the doors slide
open. The passengers step out, turn and stride through the double
glass doors of the consulate, where an inviting sign says: Canada
Welcomes Immigrants.
   ``The main point is 1997; we want some insurance,'' said a
40-year-old mechanical engineer who came with his wife and two
children to pick up an immigration form. That is the year Britain
hands Hong Kong back to China.
   A year after horrified residents of the crown colony watched
their communist rulers-to-be crush the democracy movement in
Beijing with military force, the desire to escape Hong Kong's
uncertain future shows no sign of abating.
   The exodus is the most visible sign that the fabric of Hong Kong
society is unraveling in the aftermath of June 4, 1989, and the
approach of 1997.
   There is a growing feeling that one of the world's great
economic success stories may be nearing its end. Forecasts for this
territory of 5.7 million people have taken a turn for the worse.
   ``After the Fourth of June massacre, China has not done anything
at all to try to restore confidence in Hong Kong,'' said Martin
Lee, a liberal member of the legislature. ``I think what the
Chinese leaders have done has been pretty destructive of any hope
of a bright future here.''
   Those actions include strident denunciations of Hong Kong's
support for the Beijing pro-democracy movement and the arrests in
China of Hong Kong residents accused of smuggling dissidents out.
   China's new constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong also causes
worry. Critics claim an anti-subversion clause and a provision
allowing Beijing to declare a state of emergency in Hong Kong could
be used to muzzle dissent.
   The constitution is supposed to guarantee that Hong Kong can
maintain capitalism for 50 years and enjoy a ``high degree of
autonomy,'' but it does not provide for a popularly elected chief
executive or a fully elected legislature.
   Bickering over Hong Kong between Beijing and London has been
unsettling. China has objected to a British nationality plan under
which 50,000 important Hong Kong residents and their families would
be offered citizenship.
   Beijing has indicated it may not recognize foreign passports
held by Hong Kong Chinese, who make up most of the population.
Analysts say China is trying to scare away anyone who could be
considered a troublemaker.
   Among those leaving are many of the bright, generally apolitical
middle-class who have helped make Hong Kong one of Asia's
economically powerful ``Little Dragons.''
   They include Mr. Poon, 40, who spent two decades reaching the
top in the insurance industry and is giving it up in August to take
his wife and young daughter to Vancouver, Canada.
   ``I think everyone in Hong Kong can be sure our freedom will be
restrained,'' said Poon, who asked to be identified only by his
surname. ``My decision to leave Hong Kong is solely because of
1997.''
   The Poons will be among about 55,000 emigrating this year, up
from an average 20,000 a few years ago.
   ``We expect this to continue right up to 1997,'' said Colin
Robertson of the Canadian consulate, which issued 22,130
immigration visas last year.
   Hong Kong's Immigration Department also issued 1,647 permits
allowing residents to take the remains of deceased relatives with
them, more than double the 1985 figure.
   Some emigrants leave behind aging parents or the mentally
retarded, said Dr. Leonard Lee, a psychiatrist at Queen Mary's
Hospital.
   ``They were using us as a dumping place in some of the cases,''
he said. Some of the abandoned elderly have attempted suicide or
turned to alcohol and drugs.
   A Western analyst, speaking anonymously, said the brain drain
could make Hong Kong ``less efficient in the way it carries out
business, the way it governs itself and the way it maintains
order.''
   That is a chilling prospect for Hong Kong, which sees itself as
the model of efficiency in this part of the world.
   A survey of government doctors last fall found that 40 percent
had applied for emigration and many more were considering it.
   ``Certainly we are very worried,'' said Dr. Ho Shiu-Wei of the
1,100-member overnment Doctors' Association. ``We can see that
there will be a drop in the level of experience.''
   Ho said patients may have to wait longer for care and ``we're
very afraid that, even if we can keep the doctors, there will be no
nurses around. ... It's very easy for them to emigrate.''
   More than half the 49 multinational corporations that responded
to a survey by Business International, a consulting firm, said they
might move their regional offices from Hong Kong.
   Persistent high inflation and a dramatic slowing of economic
growth have exacerbated the political crisis.
   After back-to-back annual growth of 14 and 7 percent, Hong
Kong's gross domestic product rose only 2.5 percent last year and
is not expected to do much better in 1990.
   There are fears that labor relations will deteriorate. Bus
drivers and firemen struck recently. Nurses and civil servants have
threatened to do so.
   Holding the territory together until 1997 is the job of a
colonial administration some observers believe may be forced to
leave early.
   ``The final ebbing of hope, combined with the perception that
Britain is not acting in Hong Kong's interest, may disrupt the
British government's wish to preside until 1997 and depart with
dignity,'' George Hicks, a local businessman, and Alvin Rabushka of
the Hoover Institutution wrote in the Asian Wall Street Journal.
   ``Seven years is too long to expect Hong Kong to remain
quiescent,'' they said. ``A peaceful handover (in 1997) can be
ruled out; an early withdrawal cannot.''
   Others feel Hong Kong will survive and continue doing what it
has done so well for so long: provide a base for doing business
with China and act as a financial center.
   High-rise buildings continue springing up, suggesting investors
feel there still is money to be made.
   William Purves, chairman of the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corp., has said the colony's leading bank will continue investing.
   Residents committed to fighting for more democracy have formed
the colony's first politiical party. They say Beijing must change
its attitude and residents must become politically active if the
territory is to have a bright future.
   Legislator Martin Lee, the party chairman, said the people must
``realize we are all in the same boat'' and ``stay on board to make
it work.''
   One thing is certain, he said: ``The people of Hong Kong will
have a future that they deserve.''

<HEAD>A Year Does Little To Heal the Wounds of Tiananmen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Political oppression at home and a bloodied image
abroad are the legacy of that night, a year ago, when Chinese
soldiers opened fire on pro-democracy students and their supporters.
   China's aging Communist Party leaders regained their slipping
hold on power the night of June 3-4, when they ordered troops to
capture Tiananmen Square and end a seven-week drive for democratic
reform by the students occupying it.
   What they lost by that decision has extended far beyond the
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people killed in the streets of
Beijing.
   The crackdown has cost China billions of dollars in reduced or
suspended foreign investment, credit, aid and tourism.
   It alienated millions of Chinese, perhaps irreversibly. It
brought to power leaders who have halted new economic reform in
favor of the central planning now being discarded elsewhere in the
world.
   A year after Tiananmen, thousands of activists still are
imprisoned without charges or trial. Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi,
China's leading dissident, and his wife are still fugitives in the
U.S. Embassy, branded counterrevolutionaries.
   Zhao Ziyang, the reformist party leader purged for allegedly
supporting the students, remains under house arrest. Martial law
was lifted in January, but paramilitary police and troops are
highly visible reminders that further unrest will be crushed
instantly.
   Premier Li Peng and new Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin say
China is stable and united, and that further demonstrations are not
possible, but diplomatic or political normality remains beyond
their grasp.
   Chinese leaders are surprised that, after a year, the West still
is united in its tough stance. In a recent interview on American
television, Jiang said Western anger over the brutal repression was
``much ado about nothing.''
   Except for two secret, controversial visits to Beijing last year
by Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, the
West has generally held to limited economic sanctions and a ban on
high-level visits.
   The West still is holding up approval of international
development loans, except those for ``human needs.''
   Some smaller commercial loans have been made, but in March the
World Bank rejected $150 million in credit for road building in
eastern China. The Asian Development Bank, under U.S. pressure and
with Japan's assent, has yet to lift a freeze on $490 million in
loans.
   Economic retrenchment and political repression have killed, for
now, China's efforts to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. Bush is likely to face a bruising battle in Congress if he
decides to continue its most-favored-nation trading status.
   Beijing's reaction to foreign criticism has been confused and
defensive. Chinese leaders insist the economic reforms and the open
door policy that senior leader Deng Xiaoping initiated in 1979 are
intact, and foreign investors are welcomed eagerly.
   ``The climate for investment is unprecedentedly better than at
any time in the past, and especially better than the time before
last June,'' Mayor Zhu Rongji of Shanghai said this month in
promoting a local development project.
   The government has made several gestures in recent months,
mainly cosmetic, aimed at improving relations with the West. It
restored the Fulbright and Peace Corps programs with the United
States, lifted martial law in Tibet and, most recently, released
211 political prisoners.
   But Chinese leaders still blame Western influence for the
democratic impulses of last year and are using anti-Western
rhetoric not heard since the xenophobic Cultural Revolution days in
1966-76.
   ``Foreign forces hostile to China that engage in subversive
activities are bound to fail,'' Premier Li told the national
legislature in March. ``Come what may, socialist China will stand
rock firm in the East.''
   China has dredged up the 1840 Opium War with Britain as an
example of Western imperialism, launched an anti-pornography
campaign that includes the banning of foreign books and accused
intellectuals of ``bourgeois liberal'' (Western) bias.
   Its leaders have refused to express regret for the many lives
lost in the assault on Tiananmen Square and insist the campaign for
democratic reform was a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion''
instigated by outside agitators.
   Few foreign businessmen left China and foreign banks again are
granting loans, but new investment remains sluggish.
   ``After June 4, there was a perception of a fundamental shift in
political power,'' said John Frisbie of the United States-China
Business Council.
   ``Certainty was replaced by a question mark about the direction
of Chinese policy, and if there is one thing investors don't like
it is uncertainty.''
   In Hong Kong, uncertainty about the future has led to a flight
of talent. About 1,000 people, mainly professionals, emigrate every
week from the British colony, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   The desire to escape is pervasive among the educated young in
China, but few can do it. The government now limits overseas study
to older scholars with proven ideological credentials, generally
for short-term programs.
   Because of their dim prospects, many of the young fall into
hedonism or political apathy.
   A few students said they would mark the June 4 anniversary by
privately toasting the dead or wearing black, the Western color of
mourning, or white, the Chinese color. But demonstrators face
certain arrest and ``nobody is going to be charging out into the
streets,'' a diplomat said.
   Ideological education, party propaganda and surveillance have
increased dramatically in the past year on campuses and in
factories.
   The entire freshman class at Beijing University, which was a
hotbed of student activism, will be shipped off this fall for a
year of military training, as was the case in 1989. At least two
other major universities are starting similar programs.
   Artists and writers, instructed to advance communist goals, have
stopped producing. Journalists, who had their brief taste of press
freedom during the pro-democracy movement, have returned to
churning out party tracts and praise for model factories and farms.
   Besides thousands of Chinese languishing in prisons, many
thousands more have had to make self-criticisms, face reduced
career opportunities or lost their jobs for participating in or
supporting the democracy movement.
   All 48 million members of the Communist Party have been told to
re-register, as part of an effort to weed out those with
``bourgeois'' tendencies.
   The government has carried out a well-publicized campaign
against official corruption, a key issue in non-student support for
last year's demonstrations, and 20-month-long austerity program has
reduced inflation.
   There have been isolated reports of strikes as a prolonged
economic slump causes layoffs and pay cuts, but the government
appeal for stability has won grudging support in a nation that
traditionally fears internal chaos.
   ``We're not adventurous like Westerners,'' said a young office
worker in Wuhan, central China. ``We want the situation to be
stable.''
   The Communist Party insists China can achieve stability and
prosperity only under its leadership and the communist system, but
has adopted a crisis mentality since Tiananmen and the downfall of
communist governments in Europe.
   Young people joining the party see it mainly as an avenue to
better jobs and more comfort. Cynicism among educated party members
``is up twenty-fold since June,'' the Western diplomat said.
   A party document in March warned of ``the danger of alienation
from the masses'' if the party ``does not use its power properly
and consciously resist the corrosive influence of the decaying
ideologies of the bourgeois and other exploiting classes.''
   The party also faces the uncertainty of what will happen after
the death of Deng Xiaoping, the man responsible for both the 1979
economic reforms and the 1989 political crackdown. Deng is 85 and
thought to be in frail health.
   Premier Li Peng, a hard-liner blamed for last year's bloodshed,
is not popular and Jiang Zemin, party chief since June, lacks a
power base in Beijing. The military, linked to President Yang
Shangkun, has a far greater political role since the army was
ordered into Beijing, and will be an important factor.
   One point of consensus emerges from the factional maneuvering:
Stopping the democracy movement was a matter of survival for the
party.
   ``They had to crush the demonstrations,'' an Asian diplomat
said. ``Otherwise, they were gone.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The days of wine and roses and hostesses with
the mostest have departed the Washington scene. Reading George
Bush's lips, capital social life is Tex-Mex, flicks and popcorn on
the side.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After the Hollywood glitz of the Reagan years,
the Washington social scene under George Bush seems as flat as last
night's champagne and as boring as the last guest to leave the
party.
   Black-tie parties for jet-setting glitterati from Beverly Hills
have given way to folksy barbecues at Camp David and cozy evenings
of popcorn and movies at the White House for a few close friends.
   Jelly beans are out. Tex-Mex junk food is in. Leave the Bill
Blass gown in the closet, and grab a Ralph Lauren sweater for
Kennebunkport. Scratch that candlelit soiree in Georgetown: the
president's heading for the horseshoe pit.
   The social whirl, in short, is gurgling down the drain.
   ``What social scene?'' asks Robin Weir, former hairdresser to
Nancy Reagan and her California friends.
   Bemoaning the decline in star quality of his salon's clientele,
Weir sniffed: ``We've gone from Betsy Bloomingdale to Roseanne
Barr.''
   Jayne Ikard, wife of a former Texas congressman and a fixture on
the local party circuit for 20 years, says her waistline tells the
story.
   ``Let's just say I gained 8 pounds during the first month of the
Reagan administration, and this year I'm staying on an even keel.
I'm not gaining and I'm not losing.''
   No one is complaining about George and Barbara Bush, who are
popular and energetic hosts. But times have changed. The Reagans
are basking in the golden West, and the grande dames of society
have gone the way of dance cards and white gloves. The nights
belong to the nouveau riche whose ideas of fun is throwing a
charity ball.
   When Bush took office, everyone eagerly awaited the emergence of
Georgette Mosbacher, wife of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher,
as Washington's hostess with the mostest.
   But Mrs. Mosbacher, perhaps wary of dipping her toe in the shark
pool, stayed in New York to run her cosmetics business. The other
prime candidate, Penne Korth, a Bush pal from Texas who co-chaired
his inaugural, shipped out as ambassador to Mauritius.
   ``It's as though somebody unplugged the Jacuzzi and we were all
sitting there wet and waiting for the action to start,'' said
society columnist Diana McLellan. ``The whole feeling of the city
has changed enormously.''
   What's different is that the epicenter of the capital's social
life has shifted to the White House, where the gregarious,
fun-loving Bushes are setting the pace with their own parties,
receptions and ``y'all come on over'' evenings with family and old
friends.
   ``The Bushes know everybody,'' said Mrs. McLellan. ``They've
been here a long time, and they know all the players.'' Mrs. Ikard
compares capital society under the Reagans and the Bushes by
saying, ``It's the difference between a flirtation and courtship
and a stable, happy marriage.''
   Says Gretchen Poston, former social secretary under President
Carter: ``This is a very serious White House, and they're not going
out to dinner parties like the Reagans. The Bushes' focus is on the
home.''
   It's a far cry from 1981, when the Reagans came to town with a
galaxy of social luminaries _ the Walter Annenbergs, William French
Smiths, Caspar Weinbergers, Charles Z. Wicks _ to excite the most
jaded partygoers.
   Bush, an old Washington hand, ushered in the '90s with a Cabinet
full of old, familiar faces. His idea of a surprise was John
Sununu, the White House chief of staff and former New Hampshire
governor, who is something less than a party animal.
   John who? Not even the social set's pricey face-lifts could hide
the frowns of dismay.
   ``The Bushes are well-liked and they entertain in a warm,
gracious manner,'' says Barbara Gamarekian of The New York Times.
``But Washington feeds on new faces and personalities, and after
eight years of the Reagans, people got tired of guest lists with
the same names, over and over again.
   ``Everyone was looking for a change, and they didn't get it,''
she said.
   In truth, Washington has grown up. Urban sprawl is rampant.
Traffic is getting impossible. Distant cow pastures have been
bulldozed for million-dollar mansions. Tiffany, the jewel of New
York's Fifth Avenue, has branched into a suburban Virginia shopping
mall.
   Long gone is the sleepy Southern town where the old-money
doyennes of high society entertained a small circle of friends at
lavish dinner parties sprinkled with senators, Cabinet members,
diplomats and Olympian newspaper pundits.
   Nobody has filled the vacuum left by the late Perle Mesta and
Gwendolyn Cafritz, the legendary Washington hostesses who made
headlines by catering to the powerful. Today's career-minded
congressional and Cabinet wives show little interest in playing the
hostess game.
   ``The reason things are so dull is that nobody has come to town
with the ambition to rise above the crowd and fill that role,''
said society watcher Charlotte Hays of The Washington Times.
   The hottest invitation in town these days arrives in a White
House envelope, or in a casual telephone call from George or
Barbara Bush.
   ``Everyone wants to be on the guest list for those very small,
very intimate parties that the Bushes give every month or so,'' he
said. ``They invite about 30 people over for a light buffet supper
and a movie. There's almost a family feeling, with the Bushes
walking around greeting each guest.''
   Those invited represent an eclectic mix of society figures,
corporate executives, political insiders, Bush children, old Texas
friends, a few media types and an occasional celebrity.
   ``The Bush circle seems endlessly expansive. There is no Bush
clique _ it just seems to go on and on,'' said Mrs. Ikard, who was
a guest at Bush's recent state dinner for Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Perez.
   Mrs. Ikard recalls past presidents who shunned outsiders.
   ``The Carters had their inner circle of Georgians. The Reagans
had the Californians, and never invited anyone up to the family
quarters on the third floor. Camelot was strictly for the Kennedy
people. Either you were in or you were out,'' she said.
   Bush doesn't seem to have an ``A list'' of social favorites that
appear regularly on White House guest lists. But his inner circle,
if there is one, probably would include such unfamiliar names as
Russell Train, John E. Chapoton, Fred Zeder and Dean Burch.

   Train is chairman of the World Wildlife Fund. Chapoton is a
Washington lawyer and former chief tax official at the Reagan
Treasury. Zeder is chairman of the Overseas Private Investment
Corp. Burch is director general of Intelsat and a former Republican
speechwriter.
   Bush delights in asking out-of-town guests to spend the night at
the White House if a party is running late. He sometimes takes a
snapshot of them lying on Lincoln's bed.
   Among those who have taken toothbrushes and pajamas upstairs in
the Bush White House are Kentucky horse breeder Will Farish,
Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub and Baine Kerr, executive
committee chairman of Pennzoil.
   Old Bush friend Jack Steele of Houston was so awed during his
sleepover in the Lincoln Bedroom that he stayed up gazing at the
Washington Monument and writing notes at the desk where Lincoln
signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
   Bush also actively courts the friendship of show business
celebrities. Recent guests at the White House or Camp David have
included muscleman and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and entertainer
Michael Jackson.
   A devoted fan of country music and the movies, Bush invited
Jimmy Dean and the Gatlin Brothers to join him as weekend guests
for a screening of ``Coupe de Ville'' at the presidential retreat
in the Catoctin mountains of western Maryland.
   The president's movie fare is as diverse as his choice of
friends. In recent months, while scooping up handfuls of popcorn
from silver bowls, he has seen ``Scandal,'' ``Field of Dreams,''
``The Hunt for Red October,'' ``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' ``Naked
Gun'' and ``Stella,'' as well as Oscar winner ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' and nominees ``Glory,'' and ``My Left Foot.''
   Bush is no stay-at-home, however.
   He likes to dash out of the White House to buy fresh bagels at
Wagshall's, a local delicatessen, or make an impromptu appearance
at the Kennedy Center for some light stage entertainment. For their
45th wedding anniversary on Jan. 6, the Bushes went there to see
``A Tuna Christmas,'' a small-town Texas comedy.
   Bush enjoys gathering family and friends for an evening of gusty
dining at local restaurants, including Galileo's, an Italian
restaurant near Dupont Circle, and the bustling Rio Grande Cafe in
suburban Bethesda, Md., which serves Tex-Mex specialties.
   Intimates say the president also favors the Peking Gourmet Inn
in suburban Fairfax County, Va., where Bush indulges the taste for
Chinese delicacies that he acquired as chief of the U.S. liaison
office in Beijing in the 1970s.
   Among his favorite dining companions is Vic Gold, longtime press
spokesman and speechwriter for Republican biggies and co-author of
Bush's autobiography, ``Looking Forward.'' Gold recently introduced
Bush to i Ricchi, a swank local Tuscan restaurant.
   When the Bushes moved in, says Gold, `they made a rule they
wouldn't be prisoners of the White House, or alter their outgoing,
gregarious style of entertaining.''
   When it's party time around town, Bush administration bigwigs
are simply staying away. Embassy Row has been quiet since the days
when Argentina's Alejandro Orfila and the dashing Iranian
ambassador, Ardeshir Zahedi, were the toast of the town.
   ``These Cabinet people have been here before, and they have
their own friendships,'' said socialite Buffy Cafritz. ``People
like Jack Kemp and Dick Cheney are a very hardworking group, I'll
tell you. They're always at their desks.''
   Mrs. Cafritz sees Washington scaling down in the 1990s to small,
intimate dinner parties. Corporate lobbyists are bankrolling the
big, black-tie blowouts that once were the specialty of the city's
grande dames. And fund-raising benefits _ from AIDS charities to
opera balls _ are proliferating.
   ``My mail is half junk mail and half invitations to benefits,''
sighed Mrs. Ikard.
   ``When Reagan was here, everyone was upscale and L.A. glamour,
or pretending to be,'' says Craig Stoltz, editor of Dossier
magazine, tip sheet of the social set. ``Now people are affecting a
commitment to issues and causes, with a lot of self-congratulating.
You hear more talk about values than at K mart on a Saturday
afternoon.''
   Mrs. Mosbacher's low profile has been a major disappointment,
says Stoltz. ``At the Democratic convention, everyone said, `Where
was George?' Now they're asking, `Where is Georgette?' She's
apparently absorbing the quieter, gentler tone of the Bush years.''
   Said hairdresser Robin Weir: ``Georgette finally gave a party
the other night and her guests had to write a check to a charitable
cause to go. It's all social conscience now. `If you want to come
to my house, you've gotta pay.'''
   Virtually unknown among the new power players on the Washington
social scene is the elitist membership of three highly secretive,
all-male social clubs to which Bush belongs _ the Bohemian Club in
San Francisco and the Alfalfa and Alibi clubs in Washington.
   The Alibi, in fact, is so clandestine that its members won't
even acknowledge that it exists. But it is known that all three
serve primarily to give prominent public figures the chance to shed
their inhibitions and enjoy eating, drinking and swapping funny
stories without fear of disclosure.
   In a recent column for Washingtonian magazine, Diana McLellan
wrote that ``the most precisely calibrated gauge of status in the
city is the seating at opening nights at the National Theater.''
   If that's true, then Alma Viator must be the ultimate authority
on the ins and outs of Bush's Washington. As the theater's public
relations director, she makes seating decisions for opening night.
   Ms. Viator, who also is a free-lance consultant on throwing
successful Washington parties, says nobody beats the president, of
course, as the prize catch of the evening. Ditto for Secretary of
State James A. Baker or Secretary Mosbacher, if Bush sends regrets.
And don't forget House Speaker Tom Foley.
   Other names high on her list include Katharine Graham, chairman
of The Washington Post Co.; Pat Kluge, estranged wife of broadcast
baron John Kluge; media heavyweights like Ted Koppel or Roger Mudd,
and headline-making diplomats like Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin.
   She tries to nab ``sort of sexy senators'' like John Kerry of
Massachusetts, Alan Simpson of Wyoming or Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, plus anyone who's ever run for president _ even if he lost.
   Throw in a couple of movie stars for excitement, she says. For
added spice, include some ``people who've gotten into a little
trouble,'' like former Reagan White House aides Michael J. Deaver
or Robert McFarlane.
   Other big names include public relations honcho Robert Gray,
playwright Larry L. King, actress Lynda Carter and the enduring
Buffy Cafritz. And then there's former House Speaker Thomas P.
O'Neill, who's ``still a huge draw'' at a Washington party even
though he spends his retirement popping out of suitcases on TV
commercials.
   ``Tip has no power, nothing,'' said Ms. Viator, ``but he has
such a great personality. He's still very much loved.''

   Regulars at the Peking Gourmet
Inn know that when Secret Service agents suddenly swarm through the
front door, President Bush is returning for another feast at his
favorite Chinese restaurant.
   Bush, in fact, might be called a regular himself. General
manager Robert Tsui says Bush has visited the Peking Gourmet Inn
about 15 times since his first visit on Sept. 2, 1985, when he was
vice president and a guest of his son, Marvin.
   The next day, Bush sat down at a typewriter and tapped out a
glowing testimonial letter to owner Eddie Tsui _ Robert's father _
that other restaurateurs would kill for.
   ``I just wanted you to know that the food was excellent ...''
Bush wrote. ``Your family swung into action and provided terrific
hospitality and delicious food _ the duck especially was
fantastic.''
   The letter is framed and hangs on a wall surrounded by
autographed photos of Bush, sometimes wearing a blue sports shirt,
enjoying the restaurant's northern Chinese cuisine with his wife,
Barbara, and their guests, who have included Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and British ambassador Sir Antony Acland.
   Bush learned about Chinese food while serving as chief U.S.
liaison officer in Beijing in 1974-75, before diplomatic relations
between the two countries were restored. Robert Tsui says the
president's tastes are well-informed.
   On one visit, Bush held a detailed, 20-minute discussion with
Robert's younger brother, executive chef George Tsui, about the
ingredients of various dishes on the menu. ``I think he knows
Chinese food very well,'' Robert Tsui said.
   The Tsui family says Bush's visits every few months are relaxed,
casual affairs with friends and family that seem to be arranged on
the spur of the moment.
   ``Instead of spending months arranging it, Mr. Bush calls
personally in the afternoon and says he's coming that evening,''
said Robert Tsui. ``Boom, it's done. He takes everyone by surprise,
even some of his guests.''
   It's only a 15-minute drive from the White House south across
the Potomac River to the Peking Gourmet Inn, situated in one of the
older neighborhood shopping centers in suburban Fairfax County, Va.
   Bush usually leaves the choice of dishes to George Tsui, who is
familiar with the president's likes and dislikes. ``We have known
for a long time that no broccoli is to be served,'' Robert Tsui
said.
   George keeps the Secret Service out of his large kitchen. ``It
makes the chefs nervous,'' he says. And he helps longtime waiter
Tak Chung Pang carry each course from the kitchen to the
presidential party's large round table behind a plush red partition
in the dining room.
   Tsui says Bush's favorite is Szechuan Beef Proper, a sweet and
spicy shredded beef served with roasted sesame seeds.
   He says the president also is fond of the Peking duck, a house
specialty, and the Four Seasons String Beans, Szechuan style, a
blend of string beans and tiny morsels of pork seasoned with ginger
and garlic and cooked in chicken stock.
   The president usually pays the bill by writing a personal check
but occasionally autographs the bill and promises to mail payment.
``You know where to send the bill,'' Bush once told his hosts.
   The Tsui children built the restaurant in 1978 as a retirement
gift for their father, Eddie, now 77, a native of Shandong Province
in China who emigrated to the United States 14 years ago after
running a couple of restaurants in Hong Kong.
   Much of the fresh foods used in the Peking Gourmet Inn's kitchen
are grown on the Tsui family's 133-acre farm near rural
Purcellville, Va., 40 miles to the west. Their homegrown produce
includes giant spring onions, Chinese chives or leeks, peppers,
celery, eggplant, garlic and garlic sprouts, a delicacy cultivated
in underground caves.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Prime time television can be sexy. Is it also,
behind the cameras, sexist? A survey reports women TV writers get
63 percent of male salaries. That's an improvement _ for males.
Women used to earn 73 cents for every male buck.

   Take actress Dana Delany. Put her in an olive
drab T-shirt. Let her run around a little, then change into a
minidress or bathing suit. Is the result sexist or one of
television's more feminist programs?
   Behind the scenes, Miss Delany's ``China Beach'' is written,
produced and directed by a staff anchored by women. Yet to stay on
the air, ABC's Vietnam-themed series must attract male viewers
riveted both by the rigors of war ... and by sweaty, comely nurses.
   Does this indicate men still rule the roost _ and the bucks _
behind the cameras of videoland?
   More women than ever before are making key creative decisions in
television. Four of ``China Beach's'' six writers last season were
female. The co-founder of television's hottest production company,
the Carsey-Werner Co., is a woman.
   Before a recent management shakeup, CBS' executive vice
president of prime time programming was Barbara Corday. The creator
and co-executive producer of ``Designing Women'' is a woman. The
producer of ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' is Marla Kell Brown.
   But while women move up television's ladder, trying to influence
program content as they climb, they still find they work for males
in a medium playing to male tastes.
   ``You'll still find a majority of shows are not only male-driven
behind the screen but also male-driven on the screen,'' said
Georgia Jeffries, the supervising producer of ``China Beach.''
   According to recent studies and interviews, women are paid far
less (as much as 50 percent) than men in comparable jobs within the
industry. And several television series have excluded women
completely from their writing staffs.
   A 1989 survey by the Writers Guild of America reported that
women writers earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by white
males. That's an improvement _for men. In 1982 women made 73 cents
for every dollar drawn by white males.
   The survey of the 1986-87 television season found more than a
dozen shows employing no female writers. The programs included
``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``Falcon Crest,'' ``Amen'' and ``21 Jump
Street.'' Almost a third of all network series had ``little or no
representation'' by female writers, concluded the report.
   The study also found that women writers were twice as likely to
be hired for sitcoms than action-adventure series.
   ``I'm sure that if I walked into an office tomorrow with an
action-adventure movie, there might be some resistance ... because
I'm a woman,'' said Diane English, the Emmy-winning creator and
co-executive producer of the CBS comedy ``Murphy Brown.''
   English and Kell Brown said, too, that male executives may
assume women producers don't have the guts to do the job.
   ``The stereotype is young, pliable and not being able to stand
up to the pressure or supervise men,'' said Kell Brown.
   The networks' entertainment divisions all are headed by men _
ABC's Robert Iger, CBS' Jeff Sagansky and NBC's Brandon Tartikoff.
Although nobody's accusing the troika of overt male chauvinism,
some women in the business believe the networks continue to
resemble a frat house grown up.
   ``I do think there's a men's club,'' said Susan Baerwald, the
executive producer of NBC Productions whose credits include ``Fatal
Vision,'' ``The Murder of Mary Phagan'' and ``The Executioner's
Song.''
   ``I do think that the networks are largely male,'' Baerwald
said. ``The people who make the decisions about programming are
largely male. And I think that's a mistake.''
   Has progress been made in the last few years? Yes. Has
discrimination been eliminated? Hardly.

   ``People have the illusion if they see more visible women
working in certain positions that in fact the industry has made
great strides,'' said Jeffries, a former story editor on CBS'
``Cagney &amp; Lacey.''
   ``I think there are strides being made, but I think, relatively,
they are being made slowly. ... There are a lot of (women) vice
presidents who have the power to say no but no power to say yes.
The power structure in this town is still occupied by men.''
   Before some women even walk into a producer's office to pitch a
screenplay or a series, they must show that they deserve to be
there _ regardless of whether their idea is good.
   ``I was one of the first women in television,'' said Susan
Harris, who created the shows ``Soap,'' ``The Golden Girls'' and
``Empty Nest.''
   ``I think initially I had to prove that I was a good writer to
be taken seriously. I don't think I was taken seriously until they
saw the writing. And then they began to treat me like a writer,''
Harris said. That sexist skepticism, she said, is societal.
   ``I've caught myself saying, `I'd rather have a man do surgery
on me than a woman.' And you really have to stop and think about
that one. It's my generation _ it's built in. Men were capable.
Women made the pot roast.''
   Said Baerwald: ``When I finished school, I was a glorified
secretary for many years. ... Now, our options are much more open.''
   Baerwald said as an in-house NBC executive her paychecks were
half that of some male colleagues of equal standing.
   Once a woman has established herself in the television business,
life isn't necessarily easier. There are some people, several
prominent women executives say, who still assume an ascending woman
either must be sleeping with or related to someone higher up.
   The reverse supposition is rarely, if ever, made about men.
   ``If a woman is successful, there must be another reason why
she's successful, as opposed to her work, tenacity and, dare we
even say, talent,'' Jeffries said.
   In the end, of course, a good writer is a good writer and a good
producer is a good producer. The ostensibly male-themed hockey
movie ``Slap Shot'' was written by a woman, Nancy Dowd. Harris is
writing a feature film about male bonding. ``The Cosby Show,''
``Roseanne,'' ``A Different World'' and ``Grand'' were all
co-created by Marcy Carsey with Tom Werner of the Carsey-Werner Co.
   Carsey declined to be interviewed, saying the focus should be on
successful producers regardless of sex.
   English could put a show on any network next week if she wanted.
   Few people would do better producing ``The Arsenio Hall Show''
than Kell Brown. Besides taking the show near the top of the
late-night charts in just a year, Kell Brown brings to the show an
indispensable point of view. She's white, female and suburban. He's
not.
   ``Arsenio and I come from as different backgrounds as
possible,'' she said. ``I come from a very white, sheltered
environment. I grew up in `The Brady Bunch.' ... He'll do a sports
joke and I'll say, `I don't know who that guy is!' In that way, we
complement each other very well.''
   Said Jeffries: ``The essential issue, of course, is talent and
productivity: can the person hired deliver in a qualitative and
quantitative manner. And I believe there are women out there who do
it and do a very good job indeed.''
   Since television influences the nation's attitudes, it's likely
the increased presence of women backstage will give viewers a fresh
point of view.
   ``I think `Murphy' in a way paved the way for a different kind
of woman,'' English said. Normally, you see the wife, the
girlfriend or the two roommates.''
   Brown's character is not married, has no boyfriend, and is a
recovering alcoholic. ``So there was a lot of fear that this woman
wouldn't be accessible and likable.'' The show is now a hit.
   And how does Jeffries feel about helping make Miss Delany a sex
object? She smiled for a moment and said with a laugh, ``I think
Dana Delany looks wonderful in a T-shirt.''

   Most producers make television shows to win
rating points. Marian Rees aims to win hearts and minds.
   Rees' productions include 1985's ``Love is Never Silent,'' the
Emmy-winning story of deaf parents and their hearing daughter, and
this year's ``A Son's Promise,'' the well-received account of a
young man's pledge to raise his orphaned brothers.
   Throughout her career, Rees has fought to deliver programs that
have often run contrary to television's lowest common-denominator
formulas. For her efforts, she is now considered one of the most
successful and acclaimed women in television.
   ``I really quarrel with the assumption that good programming is
bad business,'' Rees said in an interview. ``People are turning
away (from the networks) not because it's bad business. They're
turning away because it's bad programming.''
   At Marian Rees Associates Inc., an independent production
company, Rees has formed an alliance with ``Hallmark Hall of
Fame.'' Collaborations with the greeting card company have yielded
``The Marva Collins Story,'' ``The Room Upstairs,'' ``Resting
Place,'' ``Love is Never Silent,'' ``Foxfire,'' ``Home Fires
Burning'' and ``The Shell Seekers.''
   The company also has production deals with all three networks,
as well as PBS and cable's Home Box Office and TNT. Since the
company was established in 1981, Marian Rees Associates has made 13
movies for television and has nine movies in various stages of
development.
   A volunteer for the Center for Population Options and
Alternative Living for the Aging, Rees said her work reflects
several concerns.
   ``My own personal goals _ and the reason I started the company _
was to be able to do the things I had a strong, strong commitment
to,'' she said. ``Most of our works try to have a spin to them on
an issue. And I've also begun to realize that they all turn around
family.''
   She studied sociology, psychology and religion at the University
of Iowa. Her first job in television was as an NBC receptionist.
   Rees served as the associate producer on the pilots of two of
television's ``Angel Dusted'' with Jean Stapleton.
   Rees knows television still has a lot of room for improvement.
   ``Children's programming is one of the shames of our industry,''
she said. ``The whole issue of selling through children's
programming is abhorrent.''
   Rees said a recent television movie about the Laker Girls was
``outright exploitation,'' and she was glad the show fared poorly
in the ratings.
   Rees is the president of Women in Film, an organization whose
future, she hopes, is not long.
   ``Until there is the evidence of equal opportunity and equal
pay, then our hope is that there will be no need for Women in Film
at all,'' she said. ``The day we celebrate its dissolution is a day
we look forward to.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Might as well be on a train, snorts air pioneer
Jepp Jeppesen of the jet age. He recalls the days when you flew by
the seat of your pants and when the compass failed, checked the
outhouses. They always faced south.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By DENIS M. SEARLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1927 Elrey ``Jepp'' Jeppesen borrowed $500,
bought an old Army surplus JN4 ``Jenny'' biplane, quit high school
and went barnstorming with a flying circus.
   Within two years he had flown the first aerial surveys of then
uncharted Mexico. He went on to survive dangerous night mail routes
over the Rockies and Northwest, and he later became an airline
captain into the 1950s.
   But it was his air navigation charts that won him both a fortune
and a place in the national Aviation Hall of Fame.
   Jack Leffler, who founded the Museum of Flight at Seattle, once
said the museum traces the history of flight from ``Leonardo da
Vinci to E.B. Jeppesen... Jepp's work has saved a lot of lives.
People who didn't use his charts ran into mountains.''
   Now 83, Jeppesen, the shy son of Danish immigrants, looks back
on that Golden Age of aviation from his home in an exclusive Cherry
Hills estate area.
   ``It was magical for me. I can't hardly believe it ever
existed,'' he said. ``Those old open airplanes _ you felt like a
bird, a part of the airplane... It was so damn much fun. You could
feel the wind on your face, the wind on the stick and the rudder.
You were part of it. Today, you just might as well get on a train.''
   A strong sense of survival prompted Jeppesen's first chart book,
a tiny hand-size loose-leaf ring binder.
   ``My motivation was to learn the routes real fast, to try to
remember all these things,'' he said of his days as a night mail
pilot. ``I started writing them down and making sketches. We
followed railroad tracks (called `hugging the UP' or Union Pacific)
and highways. We needed to know the size of the fields, where they
were, obstructions (such as smokestacks, water towers, power lines,
trees, mountains).
   ``All of the outhouses faced south. If your compass went out and
you could find an outhouse, you could find out what direction you
were going.''
   Jeppesen's little black notebook became the granddaddy of the
Jeppesen Airway Manual first published in 1933. It sold for $10 and
included landing approach procedures for 50 airfields between
Chicago and Oakland, Calif.
   Jeppesen confirmed his information by driving the entire
distance by car, climbing mountains and smokestacks and water
towers with altimeters strapped on his back. He obtained additional
information from city and county engineers, surveyors and farmers.
   Today, Jeppesen Airway Manuals are used by all U.S. airlines,
many foreign carriers and two-thirds of all instrument-rated pilots.
   When instrument flying was introduced during the mid-1930s,
Jeppesen updated his black book to show pilots how to follow radio
beacons, mileage reference charts and terrain elevation profiles.
   ``I believed instrument flying was the only way we were going to
be able to'' develop aviation into a reliable form of
transportation, he said.
   ``At the outbreak of World War II, I had the whole United States
covered. I gave 50 of the manuals to the military'' and secured
contracts with both the Navy and Army air arms, he said.
   His aviation navigation chart business began as a moonlighting
business with the help of his wife, Nadine, a United Airline
stewardess he met and married in 1936. They worked from their
basement in homes in Cheyenne, Salt Lake and Denver as United moved
Jeppesen about during his commercial pilot career. College students
were hired as draftsmen and artists.
   Finally, in 1954 in Denver, the stress of two full-time jobs
became too much. Under doctors' orders, Jeppesen retired from
commercial flying at the age of 47.
   When he sold his Denver-based air navigation chart company in
1961, it was grossing $5 million a year and had more than 200
employees. Today it employs 840 staff worldwide and grosses $80
million annually.
   Jeppesen launched his long aviation career as a teen-ager.
   ``I never finished high school. I soloed (with just two hours
and 15 minutes flying time) and bought this Jenny for $500 _
borrowed most of it from people on my paper route (in Odell, Ore.).
I got in the airplane and just never got out of it.
   ``I'd been sleeping in the hangar, gassing engines, going
barnstorming with the older guys, doing a little wing-walking,'' he
recalled.

   ``I used to take this old Jenny up to about 5,000 feet over the
Columbia River and make long slow loops all the way down ...''
   ``The hum of the engine had a lot to do with it, the noise of
the propeller _ it all glued together for a sensation you certainly
can't enjoy today on an airliner,'' Jeppesen said.
   ``I used the Jenny for barnstorming. They called it a flying
circus. Two or three of us would get our planes and go into a town,
do some stunts to attract the people ... then charge them $10-$20
for a 15-minute ride.''
   In 1929 he landed a job with Royal Dutch Shell Oil flying
English aerial photographer Sidney Bonnick on a pictorial survey of
then-uncharted Mexico.
   He was the 27th pilot to be licensed in Oregon, the 31st in
Mexico and his Federation Aeronautique International pilot license
is No.7034, dated Jan. 29, 1929, and signed by Orville Wright.
   In 1930 he began flying the night mail _ it paid twice as much
as flying by day _ for Varney Airlines at Portland, and then joined
Boeing Air Transport. Both companies later merged to become United
Airlines, the carrier Jeppesen flew for until 1954.
   On the mail runs in Wyoming, he remembers the wind so strong
against the puny power of the plane that sometimes he'd be flying
backwards.
   Flying the mail early in the 1930s was flying by the seat of
your pants, said Jeppesen.
   ``We guided mostly on terrain features and dead reckoning. We
flew anywhere from 50 to 300 feet'' above the ground, he said.
   ``I had to start learning fast. Anytime somebody got sick or
killed, they'd say `Send Jepp over there - he's only got a suitcase
and no family.' I got to fly a lot of runs that way.''
   Four of the 18 pilots on the Oakland, Calif. to Cheyenne run
were killed in the winter of 1930.
   Flying the night mail in a cold open cockpit, with ice on the
wings, ``You just staggered along. The prop would throw ice off and
it would crash against the fuselage like a rifle bullet. The ice
would get on the wing wires and vibrate and snap like a gun shot...
   ``The most fun was barnstorming,'' he says.
   His bright blue eyes look far away as that era seems to fly past
his mind in review.
   ``God, I'd love to do it all again.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Nowhere do celebrity stars shine brighter than
along the heavenly California beach named Malibu. But Tuesday they
will pause in their orbits to vote about such earthly matters as
secession _ and sewage.

<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia yearn for
independence from the Soviet Union. Staten Island wants to secede
from New York City. Not all that long ago New York City wanted to
secede from New York State.
   So far nothing. In politics, there is no such thing as no-fault
divorce.
   But Tuesday the 20,000 residents of this spangled coastal
community _ everyone from Andrews (Julie) to Zimbalist (Efrem) _
put their local political future on the line. About half of them,
those who are eligible to go to the polls, can declare their desire
to secede from Los Angeles County and become a city in charge of
its own future.
   Similar independence movements have become a wavelet along the
golden strand from LA to San Diego.
   It's been a 26-year, off-and-on battle, cityhood supporters
thwarted over and over again from gaining self-determination.
   For over two years the County Board of Supervisors has
repeatedly blocked the way to the polls. This year Superior Court
Judge Dzintra Janavs ordered them to stand aside.
   The county wanted to delay the vote a year, pleading bureacratic
adjustments. When that was taken to the same Superior Court Judge,
the county removed her and installed a new judge. But alas that
judge ruled the year delay unnecessary.
   In Malibu they were wearing T-shirts that asked: ``What's the
difference between Malibu and the United States? In the United
States you can vote.''
   Cityhood seems to have a real chance at last.
   It inspired President George Bush in a Beverly Hills speech to
say:
   ``People from Panama to Prague are striving for democracy.
Self-determination is contagious; they even want it in Malibu, I
understand _ leaping over volleyball nets to freedom.''
   Which brings in a third player in the freedom game.
   Pepperdine University, high on a splendiferous hill overlooking
the Pacific and known on national television for fielding
extravagantly talented volleyball teams, has already gone to other
state authorities for permission to be captain of its fate, master
of its sewage.
   Sewage, believe it or not, is the key word.
   Like the Grand Canyon, Malibu must be seen to be appreciated. It
stretches 26 miles along the charmed California coast north of
Santa Monica and the Pacific Palisades, both evidence of what
unencumbered development can do, where houses were built on eroding
sand bluffs in an effort to catch the ocean view.
   Burning red sunsets over the Pacific, the high light catching
the mountains, become so commonplace to residents they barely take
notice. They do notice that on a clear day they can see Santa
Catalina Island, 23 miles out.
   In their book ``Backroom Politics,'' authors Bill and Nancy
Boyarsky wrote of the long sewer battle:
   ``One of the few communities that has learned to understand this
obscure political game is Malibu in Southern California, where the
Santa Monica Mountains reach the sea. There, the canyons widen into
coastal plain and then become part of the beaches.
   ``Malibu is almost 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles, and, even
today, it still has a bit of a rural look. But only a little. Just
a few feet separate houses on the beach, and during rush hour and
on weekends, the Pacific Coast Highway, which runs through Malibu,
is a noisy, smelly tangle of recreational vans, sports cars, camper
trucks and sedans...
   ``...the desire to develop Malibu has not diminished. There is
still vacant land, and the only thing stopping a building boom
along the beach and back into the mountains is the lack of sewers.''

<HEAD>MALIBU, Calif.: of sewers.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   That was written 16 years ago and nothing has changed, save a
few more businesses, including a new hotel, on the ocean side of
the highway. The beach has been developed but empty spaces stretch
inland.
   On the other side of the mountains is the San Fernando Valley
where sewers preceded unprecedented home building, a constant
reminder of what can happen.
   Pepperdine, in the middle of what would become the city of
Malibu, got itself declared exempt from the proposed municipality.
The university does not want anyone else determining its future
plans. Nor does the would-be city want Pepperdine governing its
future.
   ``This is a town with a university,'' says Joan House, one
candidate for city council, ``not a university town.''
   Early cityhood failures in 1964 and 1976 could be blamed on the
fear of higher taxes.
   But at the same time the same voters voted down bond issues that
would have built extensive sewers which meant more homes, more
people.
   The vote for cityhood was meant to be a vote to answer the
question once and for all. But no. Knowledgeable Malibuans point
out that the ballot also has five slots for the first city council.
There are so many candidates against development and so few on the
other side that a unified anti-city, pro-development minority could
easily win the council over a splintered majority.
   A mayor would be elected from a new city council. Currently
actor Martin Sheen is honorary mayor.
   Perhaps because of its celebrity community, perhaps for its
laid-back nature, Malibu, like other suburbs of the movie industry,
gets no respect. After his comments on freedom for Malibu,
President Bush in another speech commented on community support
groups springing up around the country. In Malibu, he said, a new
crisis support group was called ``Mothers for Perrier.''
   But a large proportion of Malibu's population are retired
teachers and engineers and the like who were lucky or farsighted
enough to buy into the beach 20 or more years ago when it was
relatively cheap. Homes that once sold for $20,000 now sell for
$750,000 and homes that sold for $150,000 now sell for over $2
million.
   Homes for most Malibuans are their whole wealth, and they have
defended them against storms that have washed their neighbors out
and fires that have raged down from the hills and landslides that
have left them isolated as surely as if they were living on an
island.
   There are certain constants. Weekend traffic chokes the Pacific
Coast Highway so badly residents don't even venture out to the
movies. The rule is a loaf of bread, a jug of wine and leave the
BMW in the driveway.
   Local politics, however, are never skin-deep. Malibu on the
sands seems to have feet of clay.
   Cozy, almost like an extended family, Malibu is learning some
harsh lessons about ego and monied interests. Cityhood supporters
say developers have already sunk millions into vacant Malibu land,
counting on sewers and more building. But some residents are
alarmed at what they consider the crass behavior of some cityhood
supporters who would pillory old and respected residents who don't
believe in their cause.
   It will all be settled June 5. Or will it?
   ``There's blood in the streets,'' says one resident. ``Come June
6, nobody's going to be talking to anybody else.''

<TEXT>
   
   ``Cadillac Man'' (Orion. Rated R)
   
   Robin Williams may well be in agreement with the Los Angeles
Lakers on the proposition that you can't win them all.
   Coming off Academy Award nominations for ``Good Morning,
Vietnam'' and ``Dead Poets Society,'' it appeared the hyper comic
could do no wrong. Alas, he throws a piston with ``Cadillac Man.''
   Williams is far too inventive a performer to fail completely.
But his protean talents are straitjacketed as Joey O'Brien, a
charmless, sex-crazy car salesman whose redemption comes too late.
   ``Cadillac Man'' begins promisingly. Under the titles, a
helicopter shot focuses on the New York skyline, then across an
endless landscape of gravestones. On the edge of the cemetery, a
funeral procession is stalled by a disabled hearse.
   Enter Joey, who sells cars with the zeal of Michael Milken
peddling junk bonds. He befriends the mortician and presents a
card. When he tries the same with the widow (Elaine Stritch in a
funny bit), she calls him a sleaze.
   That's what he is, all right. Joey will say anything to sell a
car. Meanwhile, he tries to service two mistresses _ one a married
woman (Fran Drescher), the other a ditsy would-be designer
(Annabella Sciorra) _ placate his ex-wife (Pamela Reed) and stay
out of the clutches of a debt-collecting mafia boss (Bill Nelson).
Joey also faces an impossible sales quota or he's fired.
   The tedium of Joey's travails ends with a crash: Tim Robbins
smashes the showroom door with his cycle. He brandishes an
automatic weapon, madly seeking the lover of his wife, who works at
the agency.
   Are hostage situations a likely source of comedy? After watching
the nightly news you might not think so. Williams and Robbins
strive mightily to make it work, and almost succeed. The rangy,
wild-eyed Robbins, impressive as the feckless minor leaguer in
``Bull Durham,'' somehow ingratiates as the reluctant terrorist.
   The two stars and the large supporting cast get little help from
Ken Friedman's lusterless script or from Roger Donaldson's
haphazard direction. The filmmakers seem to believe that loud is
funny. It ain't.
   The Orion Pictures release was produced by Donaldson and Charles
Roven. The rating is R for vulgar dialogue and simulated oral sex.
Running time: 97 minutes.

   ``Fire Birds'' (Touchstone Pictures. Rated PG-13)
   
   A sure sign that a movie is doomed from the start is when it
opens with a printed quote from President Bush's September 1989
so-called ``war'' on Colombian drug lords, and the screening
audience giggles.
   ``Fire Birds'' tumbles to the very depths of lousy filmmaking on
that note.
   With a stilted screenplay by Nick Thiel and Paul F. Edwards
(story by Step Tyner, John K. Swenson and Dale Dye) that never
quite figures out if it's a silly love story or a contrived
adventure, ``Fire Birds'' just might be a poor attempt at Hollywood
patriotism.
   Jake Preston (Nicolas Cage) and Billie Lee Guthrie (Sean Young)
are part of an elite Army helicopter corps being trained for a
secret invasion in South America. Their expert mentor is Brad
Little (Tommy Lee Jones).
   Training is partly through computerized simulators, which make
video games look wimpy, and actual flight maneuvers. The shots,
whether computerized or real, are breathtaking, and provide the
only real excitement in the movie.
   Jake, in Muhammad Ali bravura, reminds anyone who'll listen that
he's ``the greatest.'' And next to Little, he is. Guthrie will
remind anyone who'll listen that she's no longer romantically
interested in Jake, who stalks her like a greedy ivory poacher.
   Love in this movie unfortunately does not take a back seat to
the mission, which is to be a strike against a mercenary named
Stoller (Bert Rhine) who is an ace with fighter helicopters. We
know Stoller is the evil bad guy because the honchos sitting around
the Pentagon conference table tell us so. And in a slide
presentation of Stoller helping drug dealers load their stuff for
transport, the Pentagon biggies show us a close-up of Stoller's
eyes. Bert Rhine must have spent hours staring in a mirror to get
just the right menace to his brow.
   But there is no clear-cut enemy in ``Fire Birds.'' It's hard to
cheer on the boys when we haven't seen the bad guys do anything
bad. That part of the story isn't developed; the filmmakers merely
slap a tag on a few people and we're to accept it. It just doesn't
wash, and makes the mission more of a cartoon than anything else.
   What also works against the movie is the romance subplot. It
slows the pacing and provides nothing in terms of moving the plot
or providing a needed dynamic. Cage, with his basset hound
droopiness and crass manners, and the anorexic-looking Young are
possibly two of the most unappealing actors in the business. Both
are difficult to watch, whether alone or together. There is no
electricity between the two, and their heated moments give off a
chill. Definitely bad casting by Mike Fenton and Judy Taylor.
   Jones, however, is a blessed relief with his rapid-fire
presentation and middle-age vulnerabilities. He's Mr. Military all
the way. He even tells his long-suffering wife at one point that he
could have made her a millionaire if he had peddled his talents in
the private sector. But serving his country was more important, he
says.
   David Green has spent most of his years as a filmmaker directing
and producing television dramas and documentaries, including ``Boy
in the Bubble.'' That small-screen experience shows in ``Fire
Birds'' because there is a limited vision and sweep. Richard T.
Stevens as second-unit director does much better with the action
shots, and Stan McClain's aerial photography is stellar.
   The production notes say producers Keith Barish and Arnold
Kopelson wanted to do for the Army what ``Top Gun'' did for the
Navy. They should be court-martialed.
   The Touchstone Pictures presentation of the Nova International
Films release is rated PG-13 for some intense action, adult
situations and some violence.

   ``Sea of Love'' (MCA Home Entertainment, VHS-Beta. No suggested
retail price. Rated R)
   
   ``Sea of Love'' might better be called ``Ocean of Despair'' or
``Tide of Terror,'' with its dual themes of lonely hearts and
vicious murders.
   Director Harold Becker has crafted a taut suspense based on a
series of murders that have one thing in common _ all the victims
had placed ads in a singles' column of a New York magazine.
   In grisly fashion, the killer has the men lay naked face down on
a bed and pretend to make love before shooting them in the back of
the head.
   Two homicide detectives, Al Pacino and John Goodman, set out to
find the killer by placing an ad of their own, believing the
murderer, a woman, will respond and fal into their trap.
   Enter Ellen Barkin _ mysterious, leggy and too alluring for
Pacino's own good. As one of the ad's respondents, she becomes a
suspect as easily as she becomes Pacino's lover.
   Barkin perfectly plays the role _ it's impossible to tell if
she's a cunning killer or guarded sad heart hurt once too often in
the dating danger zone. And that quirky smile of her's _ one side
sloping downward _ adds a hint of melancholy to even the lightest
moments.
   Pacino, who makes his return to film after a four-year,
self-imposed absence, is perfect as a paunchy, divorced alcoholic.
His puffy, glassy eyes seem to have seen too many dead bodies and
too many bars at closing time.
   The movie gets its gritty realism from the dialogue written by
Richard Price, who befriended New York cops to get little nuggets
such as calling a victim ``a face-down taxpayer,'' and calling the
suspect a ``doer'' and a ``shooter.''
   If there is a flaw in this film, it's the pat ending that seems
to put on a forced happy face. Perhaps Hollywood executives demand
audiences be given a warm, fuzzy finish. But viewers will find this
one ingratiating and disappointing.

   ``King Blank To'' (Beggars Banquet) _ The Ian Lowery Group
   
   Restless singer Ian Lowery's career has taken him from The Wall
to Ski Patrol, Folk Devils and a solo career as King Blank. That's
four bands, no hits.
   Now King Blank has been renamed The Ian Lowery Group for its
second album, ``King Blank To.'' The uninitiated will need to hear
it just once to understand how fame has eluded Lowery.
   Commercial he's not; Lowery's music can be described as
neo-punk. Dueling guitars recall Television, jarring chord
progressions are reminiscent of Richard Hell and nihilistic singing
suggests Johnny Rotten. ``I need nobody or anything. Can you
imagine?'' Lowery snarls in ``Need.''
   The mixture results in a sound that's original and hard to
dismiss. There's a kind of recklessness to rockers such as ``Never
Trust Me'' and ``You're Gonna Pay'' that is bracing. The energy
flags only on the album's slowest songs, ``Wild Times'' and ``The
Party.''
   Best of all are Lowery's lyrics. He comes across like Lou Reed
after an especially bad day at the office. Dark descriptions of
life on the fringe shed new light on such subjects as betrayal,
revenge, sex, drugs and murder.
   The standout cut is ``Jack Dust,'' a banjo-driven folk song with
a violent storyline, a sense of humor and several neat plot twists.
There ought to be a market for work this good.

   Peter and the Wolf, Op. 67, by Sergei Prokofiev; The Carnival of
the Animals (EMI) _ Philharmonia Orchestra, Efrem Kurtz, conductor;
Jonathan Winters, narrator
   
   Welcome to the Jonathan Winters show. The comedian's name looms
larger than the titles of the works on the booklet, and his
breathless bio comes first. He also dominates this disc in just
about every other way, usually not to its advantage.
   First, his voice and the orchestra sound like they are in
differemt rooms, with the orchestra in the back of the house and
Winters close up. In fact, they sound separately recorded. The
orchestra, meanwhile, has a dull, lifeless quality, and the
playing, particularly in Peter and the Wolf, is indifferent.
   Winters, when reading the text, lets a bored note creep into his
voice. He also frequently adds his own comments and imitations of
the characters, which generally don't equal what the music can do.
He follows with little asides identifying what he's imitating.
Younger children might be disturbed to hear Winters comment that
the cat sounds like she'd been run over by a car.
   Saint-Saens' musical bestiary comes off better. Winters sticks
to the text, and shows his brilliance as a mimic by using different
accents for the charming and witty Ogden Nash verse that introduces
each section. Ray Clark's cello solo in ``The Swan'' is long-necked
and eloquent.

   The Whitney Musuem of American Art will present a retrospective
of the entire career of Maurice Prendergast, one of the leading
figures in the development of American modernism in the early 20th
century.
   Prendergast, who was born in Newfoundland in 1858, did not
receive formal art training until 1891 when he spent a brief time
at the Academie Julian in Paris.
   He studied Cezanne, Whistler and the Nabis painters, and was the
first American to return from Europe who assimilated
post-Impressionist styles in his work.
   The Whitney exhibit is grouped: ``La Belle Epoque: Observations
of Modern Life, 1891-1906,'' ``Early Modernism: Studies in Color
and Form, 1907-1913,'' ``Personal Vision: Myth, Fantasy and the
Idyll, 1914-1924.''
   The retrospective opens June 1 and runs through Sept. 2.
   Here is a list of exhibits and shows at other galleries and
museums in the United States.

   Charlton Heston doesn't think he got the part
of Moses all by himself in Cecil B. DeMille's epic ``The Ten
Commandments.''
   ``I think Michaelangelo got me the part,'' he says.
   The 1956 classic is back in the news. As part of its film
preservation program, Paramount Pictures has restored prints in
70mm with six-track stereo sound. ``The Ten Commandments'' was
shown at two Los Angeles theaters on May 16-24, with engagements to
follow across the country.
   At his Coldwater Canyon home, Heston recalled his dealings with
DeMille, the ultimate autocrat of the movie set.
   ``DeMille's casting method was very curious,'' said the actor,
who had starred for the director in ``The Greatest Show on Earth.''
   ``You never got to read the script; nobody did. He would tell
you the story of the film from the point of view of your character.
He would tell you the various scenes, and he already had designs
for the props and sets and costumes. He would show you all these
things, but he never would say, `I am considering you for this
part.'
   ``So you couldn't say, `I'd really like to play that part, and
it would be marvelous to have it.' All you could say was, `It
certainly sounds like it's going to be a marvelous picture, Mr.
DeMille.'
   ``Then two or three months later he would call you in and it
would be essentially the same thing, though he had more things to
show you. Finally, he made a choice. But you were never engaged in
a dialogue on that score,'' Heston said.
   ``I think the thing he could never get out of his mind was that
early in the casting process, someone pointed out that
Michaelangelo's statue of Moses looked very much like me. It really
does. The broken nose is the same, the cheekbones, the long jaw,
the forehead, the deep-set eyes and all that.''
   Paramount's restoration and re-release of its classics (the
first was ``Funny Face'') drew applause from Heston. Long involved
with the American Film Institute, he has been vitally interested in
preservation _ ``the most important thing the AFI does.''
   ``If (restoration) doesn't take place, then the film is gone,''
he said. ``That would be tragic, because film has been described
not only as the art form of the 20th century, but the American art
form.
   ``Paramount is taking a significant lead in the archival
process. Behind what used to be the Paramount tank with the big sky
cyclorama (a curved screen used as background for stage settings)
in back, where many of the scenes for `The Ten Commandments' were
shot, the studio is building an archival facility. It will be used
to store films under controlled conditions of climate and
humidity.''
   Illinois-born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from
Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a
five-picture contract with Hal Wallis. His first movie was ``Dark
City.'' His second film was ``The Greatest Show on Earth,'' which
he says brought his best notice ever.
   DeMille showed him a letter from a moviegoer who complimented
James Stewart, Betty Hutton, Gloria Grahame, Cornel Wilde and the
rest of the cast, adding, ``I thought the circus manager did very
well in there with the real actors.''
   Heston appeared in a few more films until DeMille summoned him
once more. Moses was an immense role for an actor barely in his 30s.
   ``I think in all there were nine different makeups,'' said
Heston. ``Not counting the baby, which my son, Fraser, played at
the age of 3 months. I went from the young prince Moses to the aged
patriarch, the white-haired, long-bearded Moses who watches his
people cross over Jordan and he goes up the mountain not to
immortality, because he wasn't divine. But he disappears from the
ken of man.''
   What was it like working for DeMille?
   ``He was very demanding, and mind you I only worked for him in
his last two pictures. If he was a martinet in his early days, that
had mellowed a bit. He was relentlessly demanding, so was Willy
Wyler, so was George Stevens.
   ``He was extraordinarily courteous with the actors; he had quite
a formal manner. He still came to work in a suit and a tie; on
location, the same suit with britches and puttees for rough country.
   ``He didn't shoot a lot of closeups. In those days they didn't.
Look at `Casablanca' and there are three closeups in the entire
film, two of Bergman and one of Bogart. The proliferation of
closeups has increased as the film definition and color gradation
has improved.''
   Heston added that DeMille often used assistant directors and
prop men as ``whipping boys'' but was always courteous to extras,
addressing them as ``ladies and gentlemen.''
   Chuck Heston at 67 has weathered the years well. He's never
dodged a controversy _ such as his battles with the liberal Ed
Asner over Screen Actors Guild politics, ads for the National Rifle
Association and his support of President Bush and other Republicans
_ and he's kept his hand in the profession. He recently starred in
``Treasure Island,'' written and directed by Fraser and released on
the TNT network. Heston reported proudly that the movie was picked
up by Warner Bros. for theatrical distribution.
   Another new film is ``Solar Crisis,'' a science-fiction tale for
release this summer. He has produced his second book, reporting on
his experience in directing ``The Caine Mutiny Court Martial'' in
China. Most recently, he was promoted to God, playing the diety in
Paul Hogan's new film ``Almost an Angel.''

   In his vintage zoot suit, two-tone wing-tipped
shoes and fashionably tipped straw hat, August Darnell is the very
picture of cool.
   The frontman for Kid Creole and the Coconuts will tell you that
himself, smiling playfully, making words sound as neatly pleated as
a well-pressed pair of slacks. ``We don't want drugs and AIDS. No to the
people of the Well
of the Egg.''
   Ramon de la Mata, urban policy consultant to the government of
the autonomous region of Madrid, which commissioned the project,
recently talked about the 71-year-old Saenz's de Oiza's perspective
in an interview.
   ``Confronted with an aggressive environment _ the adjacent
traffic-clogged M-30 beltway and surrounding faceless apartment
blocks _ Oiza builds a wall around his houses, saying, `I don't
like this city; let's turn this building in on itself.'''
   Pozo del Huevo is one of numerous shantytowns built in the 1950s
on the outskirts of Madrid by rural immigrants drawn to the city by
an industrial boom. Land speculation and inadequate provisions for
public dwellings condemned them and their children to sub-standard
housing in areas that have become breeding grounds for delinquency
and drug trafficking.
   Oiza's rejection of the urban environment through his walled
city is felt as a snub to the residents of the prosperous adjacent
La Estrella neighborhood and the surrounding area of Moratalaz,
where prices for three-bedroom apartments have almost doubled since
1987.
   Their damaged pride surfaced as raw fury when they learned it
would be the inhabitants of the Pozo del Huevo shantytown _ in
their eyes, all Gypsies, drug addicts and carriers of switchblade
knives _ who would be moving into the project.
   ``A lot of people talk about preventive medicine these days,''
said local resident and hospital employee Juan Domingo. ``Well,
what we want to do is prevent a crime wave around here.''
   As Madrid's sensationalist press fueled the fires with such
headlines as ``The Human Cage,'' and ``Prison for the Poor,''
residents of La Estrella and Moratalaz cut traffic on the M-30
every Thursday afternoon, demanding that the Pozo del Huevo people
be housed elsewhere and the Saenz de Oiza apartments be sold to
people such as themselves.
   Some 65 percent of the adult males in the Pozo del Huevo are
seasonal construction workers and, as in most urban areas of Spain,
youth umemployment is more than double the 16 percent overall
national rate.
   But heroin addiction and trafficking, endemic in most of
Madrid's other marginal areas, and the accompanying high crime
levels are negligible.
   ``We drove the dealers out at gunpoint,'' says Tomas Blazquez,
president of the Pozo del Huevo neighborhood association.
   Maria Luisa, who lives with her husband, two children and
parents-in-law in one of the damp, ramshackle shanties in Pozo del
Huevo, says there is concealed homelessness in Madrid.
   ``Nobody dares to build shanty houses anymore. Twenty years ago,
you got married young, and if you didn't have a house, you built a
shanty. Now young people carry on living with their parents in
their shanties.''
   But urban affairs officials say shanty-building on the fringes
of Madrid, however illegal, is still very active.
   Housing Relocation head Rosa Molina says gypsies who live in the
La Veguilla shantytown north of the city are now building shanties
for Moroccans, the most recent of the immigrant arrivals, and
renting them for the equivalent of $100 a month.
   Another housing official, Miguel Angel Pascual, say this
``shanty speculation'' is being fueled by the massive influx into
the Madrid area by families attracted by news of government plans
to build extensive low-cost housing.
   When the government council member for urban policy urged that
the $18.6 million Saenz de Oiza project apartments be sold to
middle-class families to finance other housing for Pozo del Huevo
people somewhere else, they marched on government headquarters,
demanding respect for the 1985 agreement. They also expressed
resentment that the architect and builders failed to solicit their
opinion about their new residence.
   A day later, the Madrid regional government renewed its
commitment to move the people of the Egg Well from their crumbling
shanties into the walled city.

   Here are some facts and figures about the United
Auto Workers union.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MEMBERSHIP: About 1 million active and 400,000 retirees in the
United States now, down from about 1.5 million active and 300,000
retirees in 1979.
   MEMBERSHIP BREAKDOWN: 68 percent in automobile and auto-parts
industries, 7 percent in the aerospace industry, 6 percent in
agricultural implements and about 20 percent in a variety of other
jobs, including some brewery workers, state employees in Michigan
and jai alai players in New England.
   LOCALS: About 1,200, all in the United States except Local 251
in Wallaceburg, Ontario.
   BARGAINING UNITS: About 3,200. Some locals have more than one
bargaining unit.
   CONTRACTS: Current labor agreements with General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. were negotiated and signed in 1987. The
UAW-Chrysler Corp. contract was signed a year later. All expire at
midnight, Sept. 14.
   HEADQUARTERS: Solidarity House in Detroit.
   LEADERSHIP: Owen Bieber, first elected at 1983 constitutional
convention. Vice Presidents Stephen Yokich, Ernie Lofton, Stan
Marshall and Odessa Kommer.
   ORGANIZATION: The union is governed by a 23-member International
Executive Board made up of seven officers and 16 regional directors.
   HISTORY: Chartered by the American Federation of Labor in August
1935, the union grew quickly after a series of sit-down strikes,
starting at GM plants in Flint. In early 1937, UAW members returned
to work after a one-page contract was signed.
   Workers at Chrysler and later Ford voted to be represented by
the union. Since its founding, the UAW has remained free of
widespread scandal and corruption that have plagued other large
labor organizations.

<HEAD>Japanese Official Stands by Criticism of U.S. Attitudes, Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-author of a book criticizing
U.S. attitudes and trade policies toward Japan said his nation is
fighting an uphill economic battle against a ``crazy giant.''
   The United States could rebound as an industrial power _ not by
Japan-bashing or retaliatory trade policies against his country,
but by reviving the spirit that settled the West, Shintaro Ishihara
said.
   ``You should help yourselves,'' he said.
   Ishihara and Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita co-wrote the 1989
book, ``The Japan That Can Say No.'' The book was published only in
Japan but translated copies and excerpts have circulated widely in
this country.
   In the book, Ishihara argues that Japan needs to be more
assertive in standing up to America. He brags about Japan's
technological superiority and suggests that Japan could change the
military balance of power by selling microchips used to target
nuclear missiles to the Soviet Union instead of America.
   Ishihara also says American criticism of Japan is based on
racism. He and Morita blame short-sighted management for America's
declining competitiveness.
   Ishihara, a conservative member of the Japanese Diet or
parliament, spoke to about 300 people Sunday at a public meeting
organized by U.S. Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., at Lawrence
Technological University in this Detroit suburb.
   ``All the Japanese believe in what I say,'' Ishihara said
through an interpreter at a news conference after the meeting
Sunday. ``Detroit is one of the focuses of the U.S.-Japan friction.
I have learned much from this town ... (but) nothing surprised me.
   ``I don't think I have to change my way of thinking.''
   Washington and Tokyo recently negotiated the removal of Japanese
import barriers on trade in satellites, supercomputers and wood
products. As a result, the Bush administration has decided not to
put Japan on this year's ``hit list'' of countries with unfair
trading practices under the ``Super 301'' provision of the 1988
Trade Act.
   Despite the agreement, Ishihara said the trade act is ``a wrong
law'' that will only increase trade tensions.
   U.S. exercise of the Super 301 clause ``is something like a
powerful giant wielding a sword _ a crazy giant, hurting
themselves,'' he said.
   Ishihara also was harshly critical of bootleg translations of
``The Japan That Can Say No'' by, among others, the Pentagon and
Levin himself _ who published portions of it in the Congressional
Record.
   ``I used to believe that freedom of speech was guaranteed in the
United States,'' Ishihara said, ``but what has been done to my book
was a lynch.'' In Washington early this month, he said he was
working on publishing an English version.
   Levin said Americans are rightly concerned about what he said
were the relatively closed markets that have contributed to this
country's $50 billion trade deficit with Japan. But he conceded
that some of Ishihara's criticism of U.S. shortcomings in
education, management and cooperation between government and the
private sector was justified.
   ``Americans feel it just isn't right that what we produce with
the sweat of our hands and the energies of our minds don't have
access to Japan,'' Levin said. ``Americans are impatient; we don't
like it.
   ``But you also heard the applause (during the public meeting)
when you heard someone say, `We've got to shape up, too,''' he
said. ``When there was no $50-billion trade deficit, nobody was
talking about racism.''
   Levin said he planned to visit Japan later this year to meet
with Ishihara and his constituents. More face-to-face meetings
could improve U.S.-Japan relations now defined mainly by government
negotiators and the media, he said.
   ``We really don't know each other very well,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains Against Yen For Fourth Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen for the
fourth consecutive trading day today, and the yen's weakening
sharply pushed down prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 153.25 yen, up 0.35 yen from last Friday's
close of 152.90 yen. After opening at 153.38 yen, it moved in a
range of 153.20 yen to 153.60 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 1.95 yen in the last four trading days.
   Currency dealers said the dollar gained from a widespread
anticipation that the decline of U.S. interest rates would stop.
   ``There was no major market-affecting news other than slowdown
of the lowering of U.S. interest rates,'' said a dealer with
Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But I
don't expect the dollar's upswing to continue much further.''
   Another dealer, at the Bank of Tokyo, said the dollar was
boosted slightly by speculative trading.
   ``Traders sought to buy the dollar up to the upper 153 level,
but could not break the barrier at 153.60 yen today,'' he said.
   In the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which fell 47.88 points last Friday, shed another 248.67
points, or 0.78 percent, closing at 31,765.05.
   Securities dealers attributed the decline to the yen's weakening
against the dollar and falling bond prices.
   ``The market sentiment is bearish because of the declining
Japanese yen,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe of Nikko Securities. ``After
the Nikkei index reached the 32,000 mark last Thursday, investors
began profit-taking, causing lower prices.''
   Dealers said construction and food shares were sold while
pharmaceutical and electronic shares rose moderately.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year

<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp. has dropped its
planned $1.5 billion merger with Novell Inc., saying a last-minute
demand by Novell's chairman for equal board representation nixed
the deal.
   ``We obviously have to question their motives, there's no way we
can deal with that,'' said Jim Manzi, president and chief executive
officer of Lotus.
   Cambridge-based Lotus and Novell announced plans to merge in
early April in an effort to forge a stronger computer software
competitor against rival Microsoft Corp. Under the stock-swap plan,
Novell was to become a subsidiary of Lotus.
   ``We are disappointed that we have had to break off
negotiations; however, in the due diligence process we discovered
that the implementation issues associated with the merger were too
great,'' Manzi said in a statement Saturday.
   In a telephone interview from Florida later, Manzi said Lotus
decided to end negotiations after Provo, Utah-based Novell made its
last-minute request.
   Manzi said he and Lotus board members met with Novell's board
and Ray Noorda, the company's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   ``We agreed to change the name of the (subsidiary) to
Lotus@Novell Corp. and agreed to make Ray chairman,'' Manzi said.
Lotus originally said Noorda would have been vice chairman of
Lotus@Novell. ``And we agreed on things that his board wanted. They
were offers I made to make sure that we were on good footing when
the transaction was completed.''
   Manzi said he had expected to finalize the deal on Friday.
``Then I get a call on Friday saying they had put in a demand for
an equal board,'' he said.
   Richard Eckel, a spokesman for Lotus, said Novell wanted an
equal number of people on the board. ``Under no circumstances would
we set up an equal board, and we said no way because it would
deadlock the board,'' he said.
   In a statement today, Novell said its board felt equal
representation was crucial to the combined company's success.
Novell said it hoped negotiations would be reopened in the future.
   Novell produces software to link computers in networks for
business-related tasks. It approached Lotus with the idea of a
merger in an effort to gain access to Lotus' worldwide market.
   Under the proposed agreement, Lotus was to swap 1.91931 shares
of its common stock for each share of Novell common. Lotus would
have issued about 41.6 million new shares, which valued Novell at
about $1.5 billion based Lotus' share price of $36.25 when the deal
was announced.
   The company's stock weakened after the announcement, though. It
was unchanged Friday at $34.25 in national over-the-counter trading.
   Novel rose 12{ cents Friday to $40.12{. Its stock stood at
$42.87{ before the merger plan was announced last month.
   The merger, which was due to be completed in July, was subject
to approval by the boards of directors and stockholders of both
companies.
   Lotus is a leading producer of business software based primarily
on its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program. It recently expanded that
program, designed for use with International Business Machine
Corp.'s personal computers, to work on computers made by other
manufacturers.
   Lotus was ranked No. 3 among software companies last year with
$556 million in revenue. It trailed No. 2 Microsoft, regarded as
the leader in business software, and Computer Associates
International Inc., according to Software Magazine. Novell had $422
million in revenue.
   ``We're doing just fine in our competition with Microsoft,''
Manzi said. ``We expect our business to be unaffected by this
action,'' he said, adding that Lotus had no plans to seek a merger
with any other companies.
   ``Right now we're back to doing our thing,'' he said.

   Stock prices declined slightly in quiet trading
today, marking time after last week's rise to a record high.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.18 to 2,812.73
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 405 up, 566 down and
501 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.80 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said there was little in the news to encourage buyers
to chase after the market's recently rally.
   Interest rates were mixed to slightly higher in the credit
markets this morning. Yields on long-term government bonds hovered
in the 8.70 percent-8.74 percent range.
   The upsurge in stock prices since the end of April has been
attributed largely to a downturn in interest rates, and
accompanying assurances that the Federal Reserve seemed less and
less likely to tighten credit.
   In the past few days, however, rates have levelled off, and
investors apparently have settled back to await signs of their next
likely move.
   K mart dropped \ to 34. The company reported earnings for the
fiscal quarter ended May 2 of 50 cents a share, against 47 cents in
the comparable period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .11 to 193.44. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .38 at 356.70.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 11.80 to
2,819.91, reducing its gain for the week to 18.33 points.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the NYSE, with
745 up, 716 down and 526 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 162.52 million shares, against 164.77
million in the previous session.

   Gerber Products Co. announced Monday it is
selling its 115 day-care centers, another divestiture aimed at
getting the company back to the basics of baby food.
   Fred Schomer, Gerber's executive vice president and chief
financial officer of Gerber, said an affiliate of KD Equities, a
New York-based private investment partnership, would buy Gerber
Children's Centers Inc. Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
   The subsidiary provides day care and educational programs for
more than 13,000 preschoolers in New York, Illinois, California,
Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia,
Texas and Arizona.
   Marion H. Antonini, chairman of KD Operating Cos., said the
company planned to keep the current staff and continue programs now
in place at the centers.
   In the last two years, Gerber has sold several unprofitable
subsidiaries, including a trucking company and companies that made
children's furniture, infant car seats, plush toys and sleepwear.
   Gerber, as it refocuses on baby food, recently announced it will
begin testing a new line of foods for children ages 18 months to 36
months.
   Analysts have applauded Gerber's decisions to divest itself of
its fringe businesses.
   Gerber reported net income of $94.1 million on sales of $1.14
billion for the year ended March 31.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were moderately
lower in early trading this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade,
pressured in part by forecasts for drier weather in the Midwest and
Southeast.
   Heavy rain during the past two weeks has slowed corn planting
and lowered yield prospects for winter wheat but the gradual
clearing expected this week could allow farmers to get back into
their fields, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president
in the grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Further selling stemmed from an Agriculture Department report
released late Friday that showed lighter-than-expected
participation by farmers in the 1990 acreage set-aside program,
which means farmers may plant more corn than the market had
anticipated.
   Analysts linked additional selling to speculation the Soviet
Union may reduce its grain imports because the cost of importing
grain has become a drain on the Soviet economy, Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1} cents to 3} cents
lower with the contract for delivery in May at $3.82 a bushel; corn
futures were 1} cents to 3\ cents lower with May at $2.82 a bushel;
oats were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with May at $1.48 a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 6{ cents lower with May at $6.07 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .55 cent higher with June at
74.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .30 cent
higher with May at 85.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent to
.37 cent higher with June at 66.95 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .63 cent to 1.63 cents higher with May at 69.85 cents
a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Friday.

   The number of working U.S. oil and natural gas
rigs rose for the third straight week, increasing by 31 to total
972, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   In the past two weeks, the rig count had posted increases of
three and then 11. Previously, the count had declined for several
weeks.
   This week's count also is well ahead of the 737 total posted a
year ago, Baker Hughes said.
   The Houston-based company's rig count is the widely watched
industry index of drilling activity. It reflects the number of
rotary rigs actively exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday,
not the number of producing wells.
   Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that merged with Baker
International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the rig
count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, California posted the largest
increase with 16, followed by Oklahoma and Louisiana, which each
gained nine rigs. Wyoming's count increased by six, Kansas' was up
by four and Pennsylvania and Ohio gained one each.
   Texas lost three rigs, Colorado was down by two and Michigan
lost one.

   K mart Corp. said Monday its first-quarter
profits rose 6.4 percent as sales increased 16.1 percent.
   K mart, the nation's second-largest retailer, reported net
income of $100.1 million, or 50 cents a share, for the quarter
ended April 26, up from $94.1 million, or 47 cents a share, for the
first quarter of fiscal 1989.
   Sales were $7.04 billion, up from $6.07 billion in the
year-earlier period.
   Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief executive officer, said
increased sales and careful monitoring of expenses boosted profits.
   K mart has more than 4,000 retail outlets in the United States,
Puerto Rico and Canada, including 2,321 K mart discount stores. It
also operates PayLess Drug, Builder's Square, Waldenbooks, PACE
membership warehouse and The Sports Authority stores.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French food manufacturer BSN SA put its U.S.
biscuit subsidiaries on the block Monday as part of its plan to
focus on high-growth markets in Eastern Europe and Asia.
   The company said its Mother's and Salerno subsidiaries, with
combined annual revenue of about $200 million, hold only 5.7
percent of the U.S. biscuit market. Further expansion would have
been too costly, BSN said.
   BSN, the second-largest biscuit producer in the world following
the acquisition of the European and Asian units of RJR Nabisco Inc.
in the past year, said new opportunities are opening in Eastern
Europe and Asia.
   The French food group retains U.S. units in other products,
including yogurt-maker Dannon Co. and Lea &amp; Perrins, a producer of
condiments.
   BSN, which posted net profit of 2.698 billion francs, or $458
million, and consolidated revenue of 48.699 billion francs, or
$8.28 billion, in 1989, teamed up with an Indian investor earlier
this year to purchase Nabisco's operations in New Zealand,
Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong for $180 million.
   It was the French company's first foothold on the East Asian
mainland.
   Last year, BSN purchased Nabisco's five European subsidiaries
for $2.5 billion, then sold off two of the units based in Britain
to recoup about half of what it had spent on the original purchase.

   Billboards showing Mikhail S. Gorbachev
touting a Minnesota-made vodka will be changed during the Soviet
president's visit to the Twin Cities next month, a liquor
wholesaler said Monday.
   ``Civically, we feel it's our part to welcome him
respectfully,'' said Mitchell Johnson, president of Johnson
Brothers Wholesale Liquor Co. of St. Paul.
   Johnson Brothers earlier had approved the billboard campaign for
Minnesota-made Karkov vodka. The billboards show a likeness of
Gorbachev holding a bottle of Karkov under the caption ``The
Party's Over,'' a reference to the Communist Party's problems.
   The 38 billboards dot the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and were
scheduled to be up until mid-June. Gorbachev is scheduled to visit
the Twin Cities for six hours on June 3 after attending summit
talks with President Bush in Washington.
   ``We planned this campaign many, many months ago. We did not
know Gorbachev was going to come to the Twin Cities,'' Johnson said.
   The billboard was created by Schmitt &amp; Sloan, a Minneapolis ad
agency. U.S. Distilled Products Co. makes the vodka in Princeton
and markets it in several states.

<HEAD>Motorola To Begin Testing All U.S. Employees For Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STANLEY D. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. said Monday it it will begin
universal drug testing of its 60,000 U.S. employees this year,
apparently becoming the second major corporation to test all
workers for substance abuse.
   The giant electronics company, based in suburban Schaumburg, has
been testing job applicants since 1987, said spokeswoman Margot
Brown. Motorola also has had a policy of testing of workers
involved in accidents or exhibiting dangerous behavior.
   Under the expanded policy, all employees will be tested within
the next three years, Ms. Brown said.
   ``Motorola has experienced problems with drug use, as have most
other major corporations,'' she said.
   Texas Instruments Inc., another electronics manufacturer, began
universal drug testing in November 1989, said spokeswoman Sandy
Christopher.
   Dallas-based Texas Instruments employs about 52,000 people in
the United States. Upper management was tested in the fourth
quarter of 1989, and testing of all employees began Jan. 2.
   ``There's been a very small percentage of employees who've
complained about invasion of their privacy. But surprisingly
enough, the employees are very supportive of the policy,'' Ms.
Christopher said.
   ``It gets into safety. Who wants to be working next to someone
that's on drugs? And to produce quality products, it's very
important to have a drug-free workplace,'' she said.
   After seeking employee opinions, Ms. Brown of Motorola said:
``What we came up with was that a lot of our employees were
concerned about a drug problem and felt that if we were going to do
testing of our employees, the only fair way to do it was to test
all of them.
   ``We feel our approach is balanced. Motorolans who don't abuse
drugs will have a safe workplace, and those who do abuse drugs will
be offered help,'' she added.
   Employees will be tested by urinalysis. If that test is
positive, a second, a more complex test will be used to check the
results. Employees testing positive once will be offered
confidential counseling, and those testing positive twice will be
dismissed.
   Neither company's workers are represented by unions.
   The Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace in Washington praised
Motorola's action.
   ``I think it's an excellent program, and it's one we have found
that employees are increasingly supportive of,'' said Mark A. de
Bernardo, the institute's executive director.
   A Gallup poll in December showed 60 percent of American workers
favor drug testing by their employers. The percentage fell to 51
percent when the 1,007 workers were asked whether companies should
be able to test any employee randomly.
   The poll also showed 29 percent of the workers surveyed thought
drug testing invaded privacy and should be done only under limited
circumstances.
   The poll, with a 3.1 percent margin of error, was commissioned
by the institute, a coalition of 14 large corporations concerned
about employer rights in battling drug abuse. Both Motorola and
Texas Instruments are institute members.
   The American Civil Liberties Union opposes such testing.
   ``Because the test will eventually test all employees makes it
no less an invasion of privacy than a totally random system,'' said
Harvey Grossman, legal director of the Illinois ACLU chapter.
   ``And the willingness of a majority of people to abandon their
privacy rights doesn't in any way invalidate the feelings and the
integrity of those who believe they're entitled to their most basic
and fundamental privacy interests despite someone paying them for
an honest day's work,'' Grossman said.
   ``We're not opposed to companies taking proper measures to
ensure that employees' performance is not impaired on the job,
particularly in safety-related issues,'' said Gene Guerrero,
legislative representative for the ACLU's Washington office.
   ``But if you as an employer are concerned about safety and
productivity, use an impairment test. Don't run around telling
people what they can do on their time off,'' Guerrero said.

   The dollar gained ground Monday in worldwide
foreign exchange as traders speculated that U.S. interest rates
would be holding steady for the time being.
   Gold prices fell after rising in Europe.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $373.30 a troy ounce, off $1.40 from late
Friday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $372.35 an ounce, down 90 cents.
   Currency dealers said the market believes the Federal Reserve
won't ease its credit policies anytime soon, and that should keep
interest rates at their current levels. Higher rates tend to
support a currency.
   Also boosting the dollar, particularly against the West German
mark, were reports of political discord in West Germany over
reunificaiton plans with East Germany, dealers said.
   But Gabriele Schmitt, a corporate dealer for the Bank of New
York, downplayed Monday's dollar advance, saying trading was so
light prior to the Memorial Day holiday that any movement in the
dollar might have been exaggerated.
   ``There really is not any liquidity in the market to have a
reasonable trading pattern,'' she said.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar gained 0.35
yen to 153.25 yen, extending its gain to 1.95 yen in four days. The
dollar traded at 153.45 yen in London, and at 153.73 yen in New
York, up from 153.00 Friday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling rose in
London to $1.6917 from $1.6910, and fell in New York to $1.6875
from $1.6900.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.66245 West German marks, up from 1.6483; 1.4217
Swiss francs, up from 1.4050; 5.6020 French francs, up from 5.5595;
1,222.50 Italian lire, up from 1,212.75; and 1.17715 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.17975.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday, included:
1.6630 West German marks, up from 1.6478; 1.4225 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4045; 5.6060 French francs, up from 5.5555; 1.8692 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8550; 1222.75 Italian lire, up from 1212.00;
and 1.1793 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1782.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $373.25 an ounce from
$369.75 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to $373.50 an ounce
from $370.60.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 22 cents to close at $374.08 an
ounce.
   Silver prices firmed. Silver bullion for current delivery
settled at $5.131 a troy ounce, up from $5.122 late Friday. Silver
rose in London to $5.14 an ounce from $5.06.

<HEAD>Soviet Newspapers Find Tough Going in Effort to Attract U.S.
Advertisers</HEAD>

   Soviet newspapers Izvestia and Pravda are
chasing American advertising pegged to the the upcoming summit
between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But
their ad salesmen are finding it's a tough sell.
   U.S. companies, even those already doing business in the Soviet
Union, are taking a go-slow approach to print advertising for a
Russian audience.
   The government-run newspaper Izvestia disclosed plans in April
to publish a pair of special supplements on the United States
during the summit, which starts next week. The Russian-language
supplements would be tucked inside about 2 million copies of the
newspaper, which has a total circulation of 11 million.
   While several U.S. companies and ad agencies have expressed
interest, none has bought space yet, an official said Monday.
   ``American businessmen are perhaps not as aggressive in terms of
looking at the market possibilities in Russia in this way,'' said
Anthony R. Wight, head of Publicitas Inc., in charge of ad sales
for Izvestia.
   Wight said Izvestia has been peddling space to Western
advertisers since January. Nearly all of the buyers so far have
been European.
   Pravda, the official newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party,
sent out notices to dozens of American companies last week
encouraging them to buy full-page ads during the summit. It claims
circulation of more than 8 million.
   ``Only a couple of years ago the very notion of rebirth of the
stock exchange in Russia or direct participation in the Soviet
enterprise amounted to heresy, but that is not the case anymore,''
Pravda's I.N. Filipov wrote to American business leaders in asking
for their advertising support.
   The message arrived via facsimile machine at some companies, and
some companies said there were skeptical about the authenticity of
the offer.
   Victor Linnik, a Pravda correspondent in New York who is
overseeing the newspaper's ad sales here, said the offer was
genuine and that the first Western advertiser in Pravda was the
German airline Lufthansa in early May.
   ``The country is moving to a new stage in its economic
development. The world has changed, and Pravda simply cannot remain
indifferent to the commercial side of its own business,'' he said.
   But Linnik said late last week no American companies had signed
up although there had been ``some interest expressed.''
   Izvestia is selling a full-page ad in the supplements for
$42,500 for a black-and-white ad; Pravda quoted a price of $50,000
for a full-page ad.
   For comparison, The Wall Street Journal charges $99,385 for a
full-page ad in its national edition; USA Today charges $57,232
during the week for a similar full-page ad in its paper.
   Ad agency executives said the lack of an independent auditing
system for Soviet circulation claims makes some companies wary of
the newspapers.
   They add that Western companies have only limited access to
Soviet markets, many have no presence there at all and some feel
they can spend their money better on other trade-related activities.
   ``It only makes sense for two reasons _ you either anticipate
going into the market or you are already there,'' said Allen Banks,
media director for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Inc. in New York.
   Pepsi-Cola International has bought time on Soviet television
and advertises on Soviet billboards and at its soft drink kiosks in
Russia, but has made no decision on newspaper advertising.
   ``We are certainly looking at it at this point, but we really
haven't come to a decision,'' said Anna Nerbovig, a spokeswoman for
Pepsi-Cola International.
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. sells Marlboro cigarettes in Russia.
``It's something we would consider, but we don't know yet,'' said
company spokeswoman Posie DiSesa.
   William E. Cornelius, director of trade policy for Dow Chemical
Co. in Midland, Mich., said Dow has been in business in the Soviet
Union for 20 years, has a sales office in Moscow and recently
completed a study of the feasibility of setting up a chemical
manufacturing complex in Russia.
   But he said his company is ``basically a supplier of industrial
products, not consumer products, and therefore advertising in those
consumer newspapers would serve no practical purpose for us.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Slide Further As Supply Outlook Grows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, continuing a recent trend linked to weather conditions
and greater availability of South American supplies.
   Grain futures also retreated in Chicago. On other commodity
markets, energy futures tumbled; precious metals were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 10 cents 11} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $6.10{ a bushel.
   Wheat futures ended 2{ cents to 3 cents lower with July at $3.37
a bushel; May corn was 4{ cents to 5\ cents lower with July at
$2.77 a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3\ cents lower with July at
$1.51\ a bushel.
   All contracts for May deliveries of grains and soybeans expired
at noon Monday. The May soybean contract went off the board at
$6.04{ a bushel, May wheat expired at $3.83{, May corn at $2.80 and
May oats at $1.44{.
   July soybeans have dropped by 50 cents a bushel since May 10,
when the Agriculture Department issued a report projecting a
bountiful 1990 harvest of 1.9 billion bushels and an increase in
the U.S. soybean stockpile.
   Analysts said rising South American soybean exports have
bolstered perceptions that Brazil and Argentina can handle current
global demand and at prices that are generally lower than in the
U.S.
   Weather conditions also have undermined soybean prices. The same
rainy weather that has hampered corn planting in the Midwest has
driven speculation that farmers will switch some of their planned
corn acres to soybeans, since soybeans can be planted later with no
loss of yield.
   Monday's forecasts called for relatively little rain this week
in the Midwest.
   ``We should see some acceleration of planting of corn and
soybeans both,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   In a weekly report issued after markets closed, the USDA said
corn planting was 76 percent finished as of Sunday compared with
the norm of 88 percent for that date; soybean planting was 17
percent done compared with the norm of 43 percent.
   Analysts linked additional selling across the board to
speculation the Soviet Union may reduce its grain imports because
the cost of importing grain has become a drain on the Soviet
economy.
   Selling pressure in the wheat market was offset by news that
China was seeking to buy 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   After the close, the USDA announced it had targeted Algeria for
sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat and Zaire for 100,000
metric tons.
   Energy futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid
perceptions of rising U.S. gasoline supplies, said Tom Bentz,
director of trading for United Energy Inc.
   He said traders will be watching Tuesday's weekly American
Petroleum Institute report for an expected increase of about 2
percent in refinery runs, which would verify the market's view that
gasoline supplies are increasing.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 47 cents
lower with June at $18.26 a barrel; heating oil was .04 cent to .58
cent lower with June at 51.44 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.60 cent to 1.08 cents lower with June at 63.35 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures fell modestly while silver futures advanced on New
York's Commodity Exchange. Platinum futures fell sharply on the New
York Merc amid profit-taking after two days of strong gains.
   Gold finished $1.50 lower across the board with June at $374.10
a troy ounce; silver was 0.9 cent to 1.4 cents higher with May at
$5.131 a troy ounce; platinum was $5.90 to $7.30 lower with July at
$501.10 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in line with stronger cash markets; pork futures finished
mostly lower on profit-taking after a three-day rally.
   Live cattle futures finished .15 cent lower to .50 cent higher
with June at 74.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to
.25 cent higher with May at 85.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .30
cent lower to .18 cent higher with June at 67 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .95 cent lower to .03 cent higher with May at
68.25 cents a pound.

   Energy futures prices declined Monday as traders
took profits in the absence of any news developments.
   Gasoline futures, which have led the market in recent sessions,
continued that trend.
   The June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell sharply,
dropping 1.08 cents to 63.35 cents a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The July contract and August contracts also
posted big declines.
   Richard Redoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said traders holding near-term contracts decided to liquidate them
and take their profits.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, fell 47 cents to settle at $18.26 a 42-gallon
barrel, and subsequent months also declined.
   Meanwhile, the June contract for delivery of home heating oil
slipped 0.48 cent to 51.44 cents a gallon, with subsequent months
also dropping.
   Traders said there were no developments to affect the market
Monday, but concerns about oversupply of gasoline and oil persisted.
   In natural gas trading, the June contract rose to $1.557 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.554 on Friday.

<HEAD>Lone Wolf Defense Lawyer Joins a Pack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stanley S. Arkin, one of the nation's best-known
trial attorneys and a leading defense lawyer in Wall Street fraud
cases, has decided to hang his shingle on someone else's door.
   The 52-year-old courtroom veteran, who began his career
defending accused murderers and drug dealers and later expanded to
more complex cases ranging from celebrity divorces to stock
manipulation, said Monday he's joining Chadbourne &amp; Park, a
250-lawyer firm based in New York, on July 1.
   Arkin's decision to vacate his lone-wolf practice after 20 years
surprised some colleagues in Manhattan's elite fraternity of
high-paid lawyers. But others called it a reflection of the growing
power of big multi-service firms that make it increasingly
difficult for smaller practices to compete.
   ``Going back a number of years ago, none of the large firms had
that capability. Most of that work was referred out,'' said Andrew
Lawler, a fellow defense attorney who has maintained his own
practice. ``As more have taken on these matters themselves, there's
fewer referrals.''
   Arkin said the increasingly complicated nature of his work
required expertise in many fields from tax law to bankruptcy, and
his association with Chadbourne ``will enable me to expand the
scope of my practice by offering clients the varied legal resources
of a major law firm.''
   Asked in a telephone interview whether he feared dulling the
allure of his rogue identity by joining a larger practice, he said:
``I'll be Stanley Arkin at Chadbourne Park and be even more
sellable.''
   Arkin is one of the country's leading securities fraud and trial
attorneys, whose client list reads like a who's who of celebrities
both on and off Wall Street. He's also is an aggressive businessman
who reportedly earns more than $1 million in fees a year and has
been known to accept non-cash compensation ranging from African
dolls to Georgia O'Keeffe paintings.
   ``Stanley is undoubtedly one of the top _ if not the top _
business getter in the private practice defense bar. More than
that, he's a remarkable lawyer,'' said attorney John Siffert, an
Arkin friend. Asked why Arkin would abandon his lone-wolf image,
Siffert said, ``a lone wolf sometimes wants to be part of the
pack.''
   Arkin's best-known claim to fame in recent years has been
representing Wall Street professionals implicated in fraud. He is
outspoken in his criticism of what he calls the overzealous
prosecution of insider trading cases, once likening it to
``shooting a black-marketeer in Russia.''
   His clients have included Richard B. Wigton, a Kidder Peabody &amp;
Co. trader who faced insider trading charges later dropped by
federal prosecutors; Salim B. Lewis, a well-known stock speculator
convicted on charges of stock manipulation; and Ronald Yagoda, head
trader at Marcus Schloss &amp; Co., acquitted of insider trading in
what became known as the ``Yuppie Five'' fraud ring.
   One of Arkin's most important clients was a comparative nobody:
Vincent Chiarella, a printer accused of illegally trading stocks
based on secret information he obtained by reading tender-offer
documents he printed.
   Arkin successfully argued an appeal before the Supreme Court in
1980 and the conviction was overturned in what became a landmark
decision about what defined an inside trader.
   He also represents Father Bruce Ritter, former head of Covenant
House, a well-known charitable organization based in New York
tainted by allegations of financial irregularities and sexual
misconduct. His matrimonial clients include Richard Snyder, chief
executive officer of Simon &amp; Schuster, and ``Tonight Show'' host
Johnny Carson.
   Chadbourne &amp; Parke is a wide ranging law firm with offices in
New York, Washington, Los Angeles, the United Arab Emirates and
beginning this summer, Moscow.

<HEAD>Newman's Dressing Goes To Burger Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Paul Newman will play a starring role in
Burger King's salad line, the fast-food chain announced Monday.
   Newman, who sells his own all-natural salad dressing nationally,
has developed five new varieties for Burger King, which will offer
them along with his original ``Newman's Own Oil &amp; Vinegar'' for
salads at its 6,000 restaurants.
   ``This all-natural product will help `shake up' awareness of our
salad line,'' said Gary Langstaff, executive vice president of
marketing for Burger King. ``We were looking for a way to
distinguish our salad offerings to customers.''
   The salad dressings are Light Italian, Bleu Cheese, French,
Thousand Island and Ranch and can be used with Burger King's
prepackaged salads: chunky chicken, chef, garden and side salads.
   Burger King will promote the new salad dressings with a ``shake
it up'' pogo stick competition in Huntington, Calif., May 25-26 and
a national television campaign beginning Tuesday.
   The TV ads feature vignettes of Newman undressing in films
including ``The Sting,'' ``The Prize'' and ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof.'' The TV ads advise viewers: ``For years, you've seen Paul
Newman undressing. Now you can see Paul Newman dressing.''
   Newman says he donates profits from his food company to charity.

<HEAD>Commodity Credit Program for Iraq to Get More Review</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Monday it
would undertake a more searching look at Iraqi credit purchases of
U.S. farm products, including payments above the market price that
may have provided cash rebates.
   Officials said an administrative review so far ``uncovered no
evidence to suggest that there has been diversion of commodities
sold to Iraq'' for illegal purposes.
   Undersecretary Richard Crowder, in releasing a report of the
review, said the U.S. government ``has not incurred any losses'' as
a result of Iraq's use of the program.
   The department's review involved credit guarantees for up to
three years. The department, through its Commodity Credit Corp.,
does not lend the money but stands behind commercial banks who do.
   Iraq has used the guarantees to buy more than $4.5 billion worth
of U.S. commodities since 1983.
   Kelly Shipp, spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter, said about $30 million is left in the first $500 million
worth of guarantees for Iraq this fiscal year. A decision on the
second $500 million will be held up while the additional review is
made.
   Among the potential irregularities checked by the department was
a ``stamp tax'' of an unspecified amount that Iraq had requested of
some exporters. Iraq has agreed to exempt the credit shipments in
the future, officials.
   The report said the administrative review, which included a
visit to Baghdad last month, suggested additional inquiry into two
key areas.
   One question involves the extent and reasons for high prices in
certain transactions, including corn, rice and sugar, during 1985
to 1987. Prices paid by Iraq appeared to be at least $10 per metric
ton higher than typical world prices for rice and corn, and $15 to
$40 higher for sugar.
   ``It appears that these price levels may have resulted in part
from supplier perceptions that Iraq was a very high-risk market due
to wartime conditions (with Iran),'' the report said.
   Other possible reasons may have been ``the limited number of
U.S. suppliers'' who were willing to deal in this high-risk market,
when Iraq was at war with Iran, and Iraq's policy of seeking
freight financing, which only a few suppliers were able or willing
to provide.
   Another uncertainty was the extent of services that may have
been provided in connection with the credit sales and whether the
values of those sales were properly reported.
   The report said these services requested of exporters by Iraq
appear to have been in the form of either additional agricultural
products, non-agricultural products such as truck parts or tires,
cash rebates or discounts or use of designated Iraqi shipping
companies.
   Officials said the review began last fall after the department
learned of allegations that approximately $720 million of
guaranteed loans were part of a loan portfolio under federal
investigation in Atlanta.
   ``Allegedly, the CCC-guaranteed loans were part of a clandestine
loan operation in which officials of the Atlanta branch of the
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro had booked more than $2 billion in
unauthorized and unreported loans to Iraq,'' the report said.
   Federal grand jury proceedings in the Atlanta case have yet to
produce indictments and no details are available, the report said.

   The stock market reached a new high for the
fourth time in the past six sessions Monday, getting still more
mileage out of its spring rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.77 points to
2,844.68, surpassing the previous closing peak of 2,831.71 it
established last Thursday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
997 up, 538 down and 486 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 166.28 million
shares, against 162.52 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 201.14 million shares.
   Interest rates were mixed to slightly lower in the credit
markets Monday. Yields on long-term government bonds hovered in the
8.68 percent-8.72 percent range.
   But analysts said hopes persisted that rates could soon resume a
more emphatic decline.
   The upsurge in stock prices since the end of April has been
attributed largely to falling interest rates, and accompanying
assurances that the Federal Reserve seems less and less likely to
tighten credit.
   Fresh support for that view is expected on Thursday, when the
Commerce Department reports on the gross national product for the
first quarter of the year. Analysts project that the data will show
growth at an annual rate of 1.5 percent to 1.7 percent, down from
an earlier estimate of 2.1 percent.
   Another positive influence was Monday's word that the government
had a larger-than-expected budget surplus of $42.52 billion in
April, against $40.57 billion in April 1989.
   The widened surplus, in a month when Treasury accounts are
typically swollen by peak tax receipts, was seen as a hopeful
development in efforts to narrow the annual government deficit.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1| to 117; Coca-Cola 1 to 43{; Philip Morris } to
44{; General Electric \ to 68&rsqb;, and Merck 2\ to 81{.
   Louisiana General Services jumped 3&lsqb; to 20\. The company agreed
to be acquired by Citizens Utilities Co. through an exchange of
each Louisiana General share for about 0.67 of a Citizens class B
share.
   Harnischfeger fell 1} to 19~. The company reported earnings for
the fiscal quarter ended April 30 of 55 cents a share, against 53
cents in the comparable period last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $31.57 billion, or
0.93 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.73 to 195.28.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.48 to 417.23, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.36 at 358.00.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 4.58 to 452.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 359.36, up 3.04.

<HEAD>Canadian Firm Sells Rubber Business To Bayer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nova Corp., a Canadian energy and chemical firm,
said Monday it was selling its Polysar rubber division to the West
German firm Bayer AG for $1.06 billion.
   Nova will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt, the
company said in a statement from its Calgary, Alberta,
headquarters. The rubber business is part of Polysar Ltd., a firm
acquired by Nova in 1988.
   Bayer said the acquisition would supplement its rubber business,
giving it plants that produce synthetic rubber primarily for tire
and industrial uses.
   The transaction, which must be approved by government officials
in the United States, Canada and Europe, also provides for Bayer to
assume Polysar's outstanding debt.
   Polysar has plants in Texas, Ontario, Belgium and France, and
employes 3,500 people.
   Bayer's interests include chemicals and health care.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has decided to postpone for
seven weeks the planned September shutdown of one of its two plants
in the St. Louis suburb of Fenton, officials said Monday.
   The company said that higher-than-expected fleet orders for
convertibles from the Sun Belt will keep Plant No. 1 running the
extra time.
   The plant, which makes the Dodge Daytona and the Chrysler
LeBaron coupe and convertible, had been scheduled to close
permanently Sept. 21, but will now remain in operation until Nov. 9.
   The decision to move its production to plants in Michigan and
Delaware will put about 2,300 hourly and salaried employees out of
work.
   Chrysler announced plans to close the plant in February, blaming
falling sales for the models made there.
   But on Monday, Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said orders for
1991 models from fleets, such as rental companies, particularly in
the Sun Belt, forced the automaker to change plans.
   Chrysler also plans to temporarily close the Newark, Del.,
plant, which will take over production of the LeBaron models, and
the Sterling Heights, Mich., plant, which will build the Daytona,
to set up assembly lines.
   Monday's decision will delay that retooling until Dec. 21,
Nicoll said.

<HEAD>Northwest Expecting Second Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines expects to make a small
profit in the second quarter after posting a first-quarter
operating loss of almost $90 million, a spokesman for the carrier
said.
   ``We are projecting a modest profit for the second quarter,''
Bob Gibbons said Monday.
   The three-month period ends June 30 and results will be
available Aug. 10.
   In the first quarter, Northwest booked its first operating loss
since the airline was taken over last August by former Marriott
Corp. executive Alfred Checchi and other investors.
   John Dasburg, the airline's finance and administration executive
vice president, attributed the loss to rising fuel costs and
unfavorable currency exchange rates.
   Gibbons said Northwest continues to make progress in reducing
the $3.1 billion debt incurred in the buyout. The debt now stands
at about $2.1 billion and Dasburg has said it will shrink to $1.75
billion by the end of the year, Gibbons said.
   Meanwhile, Gibbons said the airline still is searching for funds
to replace part of an equity investment by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
that was part of the buyout. KLM was forced by the U.S.
Transportation Department to shave its $400 million equity stake to
$175 million.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf to UPDATE with content of Cowboy Channel. Also

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable TV seemed to have something for everyone at
an industry convention: a Cowboy Channel, In Court Television for
law junkies, even a senior citizen network ``for viewers who
weren't born yesterday.''
   The big question at the National Cable Television Association
convention Monday seemed to be how to sell so many choices to
viewers.
   Dozens of displays by huge variety of cable outlets greeted
visitors.
   Alongside the established networks _ such as Turner Broadcasting
System Inc.'s family of channels and familiar faces HBO, MTV and
ESPN _ were a host of new choices.
   Among the many starting or planning to broadcast were the law
channel, Country star Willie Nelson's Cowboy Channel, to carry
Western movies and country music videos, and Golden American
Network for senior citizens.
   The narrow focus of many of these new channels reflects the
industry's growing strategy of targeting ``niche'' channels, cable
officials said.
   Cable executives participating in a panel discussion Monday said
that technology expected to arrive in this decade will greatly
expand the capacity of local cable systems to carry more channels.
That means programming may be sold the way magazines are, targeted
at specific-interest audiences.
   The key will be whether the special interest channels can
succeed with an audience of less than 1 million subscribers, said
Charles Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems Corp. of Woodbury,
N.Y.
   By contrast, the seven largest cable channels all currently are
available to more than 50 million subscribers.
   ``The challenge is to find large enough niches,'' said John
Malone, president of Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver.
   Some executives suggested a package of special-interest stations
could be sold to the viewer. That would be in contrast to today's
broad basic service, which might include programming without
interest for any particular customer.
   Such a limited service might be viable with ``niche
sponsorship,'' if advertisers were willing to pay a higher rate for
commercial time knowing that the audience was a prime target for
their product, Malone said.
   But Robert Miron, president of Newhouse Broadcasting of North
Syracuse, N.Y., cautioned that ``it would be dangerous to destroy''
broad-based basic cable service.
   Such concerns are being debated in the conference rooms during
the three-day meeting, but on the exhibit floor it's all showbiz.
   Nelson, who is the chairman of the board of the Cowboy Channel,
drew a long line of conventioneers seeking his autograph. The only
longer line was the one to meet Renee Tenison, Playboy magazine's
1990 Playmate of the Year, who was signing autographs at the
Playboy at Night network's booth.
   The big shots of the industry appeared to be in a contest for
who could construct the most impressive promotional booth. The
Disney Channel's, for example, was a sprawling white and silver
castle, each side equipped with a trio of TV screens showing Disney
programs.
   Not surprisingly, one of the largest exhibits belonged to
Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting. The gleaming display included
lounge areas and private meeting rooms.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Higher, Share Prices Edge Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar opened higher against the yen Tuesday
morning, helping trigger an early decline in share prices on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar started trading at 153.36 yen, up 0.11 yen from
Monday's 153.25-yen close.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 134.65 points, or 0.42
percent, to hit 31,630.40 within the first 25 minutes of trading.
The index lost 248.67 points on Monday.
   The dollar was moving narrowly in early trading after its higher
opening, which followed overnight gains in New York, said Kimio
Kobori, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dollar closed Monday at 153.73 yen in New York, up from
153.00 yen last Friday.
   The dollar's gain in New York resulted from a market belief that
the Federal Reserve won't ease its credit policies anytime soon,
keeping interest rates at current levels. Higher rates tend to
support a currency.
   Kobori said, ``Trading in Tokyo is hardly moving mainly because
there is no major market-affecting news here now.''
   Traders attributed the Nikkei's early fell to the yen's
continuing weakness agaisnt the dollar, which discouraged stock
investors and sent them to the sidelines.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond inched up to 87.18 from Monday's close of
87.09. That lowered the yield to 7.13 percent from 7.15 percent.

<HEAD>Soviet Ag Official: `Support Us. Help Us Out'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet policymaker said his country's
economic restructuring will be jeopardized without the help of U.S.
farm technology to improve agricultural production.
   ``Support us. Help us out. Share your know-how,'' Ivan Skiba,
chief of the agrarian department of the Central Committee of the
Soviet Communist Party, told an audience of academics, businessmen
and farm leaders Monday.
   A Harvard economist, however, was pessimistic about the
prospects for success in the reforms being pushed by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``Gorbachev has inherited a very sick society. Unfortunately,
he's made it worse,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate director of
the Russian Research Center at Harvard.
   The exchange came at Iowa State University at a symposium on
economic and political reforms in the USSR.
   Skiba said agriculture is a top Soviet priority.
   ``Without it, further movement in perestroika would be vexed,''
he said.
   Skiba said the problem of Soviet food supplies is becoming more
acute despite increased production. He said major investments and
joint ventures are needed.
   Major priorities are improving food storage and processing and
developing an open-market economy, said Alexander Nikonov,
president of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences
and a top advisor to Gorbachev.
   Nikonov said losses from grain and commodity spoilage are valued
at five times Soviet farm imports.
   Skiba predicted radical changes in Soviet grain purchases,
expanding on a shift that began in recent years toward increased
interest in soybeans and soybean products to enhance the protein
content of livestock feed.
   Skiba said Soviet inflation is running at 7.5 percent, peasants
are not accepting programs aimed at moving to private ownership of
land and continued subsidizes to ensure low food prices are no
longer defensible economically.
   In Moscow, a document obtained Monday by The Associated Press
showed that the Kremlin plans to double food prices as part of
desperately needed economic reforms to gradually introduce a market
economy.
   Goldman said the Soviet economy is in more serious trouble, with
inflation running as high as 20 percent and the economy actually
contracting at a real rate of at least 5 percent. Food products are
rationed in almost every large city, he said.
   The Soviet budget deficit has ballooned to 10 percent to 12
percent of gross national product, compared with a U.S. deficit
equivalent to 3 percent to 4 percent of GNP, he said.
   ``I think prospects for reform are dim,'' Goldman said.

<HEAD>American General Wins Proxy Fight in Preliminary Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American General Corp., which surprised
shareholders recently by announcing the company was for sale, said
preliminary results showed it prevailed in a proxy fight with a
suitor, Torchmark Corp.
   American General, the nation's fourth-largest insurance company,
said Monday that results from independent inspectors of the
shareholder vote at the May 2 annual meeting indicated that the
company's slate of six board candidates defeated Torchmark's slate
by a margin of 2-to-1.
   Shareholders also rejected resolutions proposed by Birmingham,
Ala.-based Torchmark calling for American General to hire an
investment bank and appoint a committee of independent directors to
evaluate acquisition proposals, American General said.
   American General said it does not expect a change in the results
but said they remain subject to review and challenge.
   American General announced at the annual meeting that the
company was vulnerable to possible acquisitions and therefore
decided to offer itself for sale to realize the maximum value for
stockholders.
   Torchmark made an unsolicited $6.34 billion cash and stock offer
in March but withdrew the offer when American General turned it
down, opting instead to wage a proxy fight to elect its own
nominees to the 15-member board.
   Houston-based American General, with subsidiaries operating in
50 states and Canada, had been battling with the much smaller
Torchmark, which is best known for its Liberty National Mutual
Insurance subsidiary.

<HEAD>Top Bank Regulator To Visit New England Amid `Credit Crunch'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top bank regulator told New
England governors Monday he will tour the region to help spread the
message that banks should continue making good loans.
   The promised visits by Comptroller of the Currency Robert L.
Clarke come in response to continued complaints that tough federal
regulations are discouraging loans to small businesses throughout
the Northeast.
   Regulators under Clarke's control are winding up several months
of extensive examinations into real estate lending at major New
England banks. But, according to the governors, the repercussions
of their work are still being felt by small and medium-sized
businesses that have been unable to continue lines of credit due to
the tightened lending climate.
   ``The bottom-line conclusion that I want to get across as a
result of this meeting is that we are not telling banks not to lend
money,'' Clarke said at a news conference in his office.
   ``We're telling banks to be careful in the way they lend
money,'' Clarke said. ``But there are still plenty of good loans to
be made.''
   Clarke met with governors Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire and John McKernan of Maine. Howard Brown,
Connecticut's banking commissioner, also attended. The governors
met earlier in the day with Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.
   Clarke said the so-called credit crunch in New England may stem
from an overreaction by banks to the heightened scrutiny by federal
regulators. Allaying the concerns of bankers, he said, would be a
major purpose of his visits.
   ``I have agreed to make several appearances in the Northeast
over the next month and I will be getting that message out,'' said
Clarke, whose office is responsible for examing national banks.
   ``It's almost inevitable that if you have a slowdown in certain
economic sectors that you're going to have a tightening of credit
standards... I don't think that's inappropriate,'' Clarke said.
``What would be inappropriate would be to just have a blanket
shutting off of the faucet.''
   The governors did not blame New England's slumping economy on
the tight credit climate created by banking regulators. But Dukakis
said innocent bystanders are being hurt.
   ``We're concerned about what has happened to the small and
medium-sized companies in New England who are good risks (and) are
the heart and soul of the New England Economy because they create
most of our new jobs and whose credit is being affected because of
what has happened on the real estate side,'' Dukakis said.
   A hotline set up in Massachusetts has heard complaints from some
250 companies haveing difficulty obtaining or continuing credit and
the state is working directly with about 50 of them, Dukakis said.
   Brown, who represented Connecticut Gov. William O'Neill at the
meeting, said federal regulators who look at loans to small
businesses ``may not have a good feel for the asset quality and the
persons behind those loans.''
   Federal examiners have, among other things, ordered banks to
reclassify as ``non-performing'' loans that have been kept current,
Brown said. They have also told banks to increase their reserves
for bad loans, taking out of circulation money that might go out as
loans to creditworthy customers, he said.
   Gregg said the response by Clarke and Greenspan Monday indicated
that the complaints from New England are being heard.
   ``We got out point across,'' Gregg said.

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s new chairman told stock
analysts the company plans to emphasize international sales during
the next year.
   ``If we do it right, it will be our principal engine of
growth,'' Edwin L. Artzt said to about 100 analysts, referring to
overseas sales.
   He also said the company will attempt to cut production and
distribution costs by $1 billion during the next two years.
   Artzt, who became the company's chairman and chief executive
officer in January, was head of P&amp;G's European division from 1975
to 1980. The two-hour meeting was his first with analysts. The
company's new fiscal year begins July 31.
   P&amp;G plans to expand development of such products as Tide laundry
detergent and Pampers diapers, which sell worldwide but are
tailored to meet local market requirements, Artzt said.
   Artzt showed nearly identical television commercials for P&amp;G
shampoo from the United States, Japan and Britain to illustrate the
company's ability to introduce the same product in different
markets.
   ``Our concept of globalization does not mean we plan to run our
business globally. My long experience on the international business
has convinced me that that would not work,'' he said.
   Emphasizing international sales is P&amp;G's most realistic way to
maintain earnings growth in its core businesses of soap and
personal care products, said Hugh Zurkuhlen, an analyst for Salomon
Brothers.
   ``The (domestic) markets for soap and toothpaste don't grow. ...
But discretionary spending is still growing in southeast Asia and
Latin America,'' he said. ``As long as there's world peace, there
is good potential for growth overseas.''
   Artzt said the company expects to maintain sales growth in the
United States through innovations such as diapers designed
especially for boys or girls.
   ``In 23 of our 41 U.S. categories, our company (market) share is
less than 25 percent,'' he said. ``Just getting to a 25 percent
share would add about $300 million after tax to our bottom line ...
in those categories.''
   P&amp;G has reduced proposed uses for its experimental fat
substitute Olestra so it can win faster U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval for the product, Artzt said. He said the
company would propose broader uses later.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Agrees to Abide by the Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp. has agreed to abide by
federal securities laws that regulators said it ignored while
overbilling the government on defense contracts.
   The aerospace contractor, although neither admitting nor denying
charges it violated securities laws, agreed to a permanent
injunction in U.S. District Court Monday barring it from
disregarding accounting and financial reporting rules in the future.
   Sundstrand also agreed to set up a committee of independent
directors to review whether the company's fraud case led to
violations not addressed by the Securities and Exchange Commission
in its complaint.
   The settlement, subject to approval by a judge, would end the
SEC's investigation.
   Sundstrand pleaded guilty in 1988 to overbilling the government
on defense contracts for airplane parts and paid nearly $200
million to settle the case, the biggest penalty ever assessed for
defense fraud.
   The commission charged that by concealing millions of dollars in
cost overruns between 1980 and 1986, Sundstrand misled investors by
underestimating its debts and overstating its profits.
   SEC lawyer Wendy D. Fox said the injunction was necessary to
ensure Sundstrand will comply with security laws in the future.
   ``Sundstrand has settled this matter in order to avoid
protracted and costly litigation over practices long since
discontinued by this company,'' said Harry C. Stonecipher,
president and chief executive officer.
   ``Sundstrand has moved on and the injunction will have no
financial impact on the company. It obliges us to do what we would
do in any event, that is, to comply with the law.''
