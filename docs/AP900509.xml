   The lawyer for a Bensonhurst racial murder
defendant was attacked by a group of demonstrators Wednesday as
jurors deliberated for their first full day without reaching a
verdict.
   Before retiring, the jury asked to review Keith Mondello's
signed statement about his admitted involvement in the shooting.
The panel also asked the trial judge, Justice Thaddeus Owens of
state Supreme Court in Brooklyn, to again explain the elements of
the four homicide charges.
   The Mondello jury, as well as a separate jury weighing evidence
against the accused triggerman in the case, Joseph Fama, retired
Wednesday shortly before 8 p.m. without reaching a verdict. Both
juries were scheduled to resume deliberations at 10 a.m. Thursday.
   Mondello was accused of two counts of second-degree murder,
first- and second-degree manslaughter and several lesser charges.
   In the three-page statement taken by the police and signed by
Mondello on the day after the shooting in the Bensonhurst
neighborhood, he admits organizing the mob, knowing that at least
one person had a gun. He also admited carrying a baseball bat when
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins was shot.
   Defense attorney Stephen Murphy says police tricked his client
into putting his name on the statement.
   Tensions surrounding the case erupted outside the courthouse at
about 2 p.m. when Murphy, on his way to a restaurant, was kicked
and hit in the face.
   Murphy said he was surrounded by a group of 15 to 20 people who
shouted, ``Yusuf! Yusuf! No peace for racists!''
   As he neared the restaurant, he said somebody kicked him in the
buttocks.
   ``I felt the kick and, when I turned around, I was punched in
the face. If I didn't turn, I would have been hit harder,'' Murphy
said.
   Murphy was not hurt and he said he would not file charges.
   He was escorted by plainclothes officers when he returned to the
courthouse.
   The second jury began its second full day of deliberations
listening to lengthy reading of the testimony of two prosecution
witnesses against Fama.
   The two defendants, both white 19-year-olds, would face 25 years
to life in jail if convicted of murdering the black teen-ager.
   Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, has asked the black community to
react with restraint if the two are acquitted.
   Testimony lasted nearly three weeks.

   A Japanese bank will help the state's small
export businesses by offering leveraged loans under an unusual
agreement announced Wednesday.
   ``This kind of innovative approach to stimulating exports is a
significant step in the effort to reduce this country's $100
billion trade deficit, of which almost 50 percent is with Japan,''
said Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey.
   Under the agreement, the state's Job Development Authority will
deposit $250,000 into a Daiwa Bank interest-earning cash collateral
account that leverages or increases the deposit at a four-to-one
ratio.
   The resulting $1 million will be available for loans to small-to
medium- sized New York state export businesses. The program will be
administered by XPORT, the Port Authority's trading company and the
first publicly owned international trading company in the nation.
   The Job Development Authority, which now will have $2.5 million
available for loans, had been running out of money to lend to
exporters who were unable to get the financing from regular banks.
   The director of XPORT, Herbert Ouida, said the program is
significant for the Japanese because it should help alleviate some
of the ill will felt toward Japan because of the trade deficit.
   ``We believe this unique export financing program will make
great progress in addressing the current trade deficit that exists
between the United States and Japan,'' said Nobuyuki Kobayashi,
executive vice president of Daiwa Bank.
   ``As a Japanese bank, we are happy to participate in a program
that may help to reduce the trade imbalance.''
   The increased money will be available to firms employing fewer
than 100 people and having annual sales of $10 million or less.

<HEAD>Bob Hope Takes His Troupe on the Road to Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Hope did his standup comedy routine in front
of the world's biggest microphone _ the heavily bugged U.S. Embassy
in Moscow _ for an appreciative audience unaccustomed to live
entertainment.
   About 300 members of the American community sat on blankets on a
grassy field in the middle of the U.S. Embassy compound on a chilly
Moscow evening Tuesday for the taping of a Hope road show.
   Never mind that the late-setting sun played havoc with the
cameras and delayed the taping, or that an audio glitch forced
Brooke Shields to perform her song twice, or that temperatures had
dipped so low into the 30s that by the time Hope sang ``Thanks for
the Memory,'' his breath was visible.
   The audience of embassy employees, their families, Marines in
dress uniforms and other Americans didn't seem to care: this was
live _ not a month-old videotaped TV show mailed from the States or
last year's hit movie.
   Hope, who turns 87 this month, is only in Moscow briefly as he
takes his troupe to various U.S. installations across Europe.
Today, he was to view the World War II Victory Day parade in Red
Square, visit landmark Novodevichy Cemetery and stop at the new
Moscow McDonald's.
   Standing on a makeshift USO stage near the soon-to-be dismantled
U.S. Embassy office building, Hope drew some of his biggest
applause with jokes about extensive Soviet electronic surveillance
at the site _ a sore subject because of the millions of dollars it
will cost to tear down and build a new embassy building.
   ``What a shame that this new U.S. Embassy has to be destroyed
because of all the listening devices hidden in it,'' he said.
``This place has so many bugs in it, it should be known as the
roach motel.''
   Or: ``I'm not saying this place is bugged, but I looked at
myself in the washroom mirror and said, `Boy, what a handsome guy!'
And the mirror said, `That's funnier than any joke you'll tell
today.'''
   U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock, asked at an embassy reception
later if he had gotten tired of all the quips about the bugged
embassy building, replied: ``It's inevitable.''
   Even the audience couldn't resist. When Miss Shields stopped
during her act and told the director she was hearing a strange
sound, some in the crowd shouted: ``Microwaves!''
   As the sun sank lower and the evening turned brisk, Hope praised
the stalwart crowd for its endurance and ad-libbed, ``I've never
played Siberia before.''
   Matlock, thanking Hope, said: ``Sitting out here in the cold,
you can really see what we're accustomed to.''
   Hope shot back, ``I've never worked to a blue audience.''
   The Moscow segment of the show also featured songs by Rosemary
Clooney and Hope's wife, Delores, and banter with Miss Universe
1990, Mona Grudt of Norway. The NBC special, to be shown on May 19,
will include the troupe's stops at Moscow, Templehof Air Force Base
in Berlin and the Berlin Wall, the Royal Air Force Base at
Mildenhall, England, and Rhein-Main Air Force Base outside
Frankfurt, West Germany.

<HEAD>Audubon Society Criticized For Wetlands Development</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONGWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A battle over development on sensitive
wetlands would be just another environmental dispute _ except that
in this case, the developer is the Florida Audubon Society.
   Homeowners near the 340-acre site in central Florida oppose
plans for a new Audubon headquarters, which is to include 20,000
square feet of office space.
   Residents complain the office would disrupt a forest preserve
between two rivers and bring unwanted traffic and noise.
   Audubon officials defend the headquarters, saying that since the
society cannot pay competitive salaries, it needs something to
attract staff.
   ``You have to make pragmatic decision,'' said state Audubon
Chairman Leah Schad. ``To have a nice place for them to work in
pleasing surroundings ... is certainly not a negative.''
   Other environmentalists said Audubon, which calls itself The
Voice of Conservation since 1900, should practice what it preaches.
   ``We have lost over 50 percent of the wetlands in this
country,'' said Sharon Carveth, who heads the Sierra Club's central
Florida chapter. ``We need to reverse that trend.''
   The homeowners association in the adjacent Sabal Point
subdivision is asking for a vote on the development, said member
Ervin England.
   Another issue clouding the project is how Audubon obtained the
tract.
   The land was set aside as a preserve a decade ago by NTS
Development Co. in exchange for permission to build Sabal Point.
   The property was given to Audubon last year, at the same time
NTS was seeking permission to build another subdivision on
sensitive land. Audubon supported that development.
   Ms. Schad said the land gift was ``absolutely not'' a factor in
the society's support.

<HEAD>Billions at Stake in Battle over Using Raw or `Cooked' Numbers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Political power and billions of dollars are at
stake in a battle over which final census numbers will be better,
the raw or the cooked, the actual count or one adjusted for people
who were probably missed.
   It's an argument that's been obscured by the early problems
plaguing the census count.
   But a year from now, the question of ``adjusting'' the results
of the census could be the center of a crucial and bitter debate
among the states and cities, in Congress and in the courts.
   ``They can't beat us out, so they want to count us out,'' John
D. Rogers, a Republican floor leader in the Kentucky Senate,
charged in a letter to the Commerce Department.
   Democrats and other advocates for minorities see the refusal to
adjust as a method of disenfranchising their voters.
   New York City Mayor David Dinkins charged that the undercount of
minorities will cost cities hundreds of millions of dollars and
many seats in Congress.
   ``They have gotten away with statistical malfeasance for 200
years and figure they can get away with it for another 10,''
Dinkins said.
   ``A decision against adjustment is a decision against a more
accurate census,'' Javier P. Guajardo, an assistant attorney
general in Texas, wrote the Commerce Department.
   ``A decision against a more accurate census is a decision
against fair representation of the American public, in particular
those who need to be counted most _ minorities, the poor and the
homeless.''
   The sides already are staking out their positions in terms of
language, with opponents referring to adjustment as ``fiddling''
with the numbers, while those in favor prefer the term
``correcting'' the count.
   Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, who heads the House subcommittee
that supervises the census, seems to be leaning toward the idea of
adjustment.
   When the billions are spent and the counting is all done, will
we know how many Americans there are, he was asked.
   ``I hope so, when we add in the known error,'' Sawyer said.
``The question is, will we take that into account.''
   The time, he said, may have come when the nation is just too
large for current methods of counting.
   ``We may be seeing the point where we need to consider more
modern statistical methods to bring the basic numbers closer to the
truth.''
   Why adjust the census?
   Because it isn't perfect.
   The bureau has never claimed it could count everyone.
   In 1980, a bureau analysis estimated that 1.4 percent of the
population was missed. But the error wasn't uniform.
   Most white, middle-class folks got counted, while the poor and
minorities were more likely to be missed. Young black men were
undercounted by as much as 6 percent, officials have estimated.
   A decade ago the decision on adjustment was left to the Census
Bureau. Statisticians there decided they weren't confident enough
in their methods to make changes in the final numbers.
   By 1987, many census workers thought an adjustment could _ and
should _ be made in 1990.
   The Commerce Department stepped in and, in late 1987, ruled that
no adjustment would be made in 1990. The ruling cited statistical
questions and contended that adjustment would erode confidence in
the census.
   Barbara Bailar, who headed the census office studying
adjustment, resigned.
   Some politicians and officials charged the decision was
political, because the minorities who are undercounted are more
likely to be Democrats.
   A group of local governments led by New York City filed suit.
   That suit was settled with a promise by the Commerce Department
to reconsider, but was later reinstated.
   The Commerce Department has set a group of criteria that will be
used to make a decision by July 15, 1991 _ several months after the
numbers have to be delivered to state and local governments for
reapportionment.
   Those criteria, opponents argued in reinstating their lawsuit,
are so stringent that they virtually prohibit adjustment.
   If a decision is eventually made to adjust, it will not be until
mid-1991.
   Because the first census reports will come out Dec. 31, that
means there would be two sets of numbers _ providing easily
identifiable winners and losers.
   The fact that there is a limited amount of money and only 435
seats in the House of Representatives means that every gain by one
state requires a loss by another.
   While the 1990 census will likely mean movement of a dozen or so
House seats from one state to another, the difference between raw
and adjusted numbers should affect only two to four seats, Sawyer
said.
   It will also mean a difference of billions of dollars in federal
and state money distributed over the next 10 years based on
population numbers.
   University of Wisconsin historian Margo Anderson, author of a
book on the history of the census, said ``the framers of the
Constitution knew that the orderly transfer of political
representation is always disruptive to some groups or interests in
society.''
   ``The test of the new methods is not whether they are
disruptive, but whether they are fair,'' she said, adding that the
department's guidelines for adjustment ``conjure up an idealized
history, the notion of a 200-year process of enumeration which
cannot be tampered with.''
   In fact, she noted, census methods have changed radically over
the centuries.
   ``The premise that the actual enumeration is the best count
possible has no factual support,'' John W. Tukey of Princeton
University told the department.
   The Census Bureau launched its effort to count the estimated 250
million Americans in late March, a project expected to take the
rest of the year.
   The tally was embroiled in controversy from the start, with
millions of forms misaddressed.
   The public response was less than the bureau had hoped. The
effort has moved to a door-to-door count, but that will cost
considerably more than if people had all received their forms and
mailed them back.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A neglected piece of land next to the
crumbling Berlin Wall has become the focus of controversy over how
to rebuild what once was the center of a vibrant capital.
   It is the spot on Potsdamer Platz, one of Europe's most elegant
squares before World War II, that the giant Daimler-Benz wants to
erect a new headquarters.
   Fears have grown in both West and East Berlin that the shopping
spree for land is about to start and that large, rich Western
companies will determine the city's future landscape.
   ``What Berlin does not need is quick projects thought up in an
illusory and short-lived reunification euphoria,'' East Berlin
architect Bruno Flierl said in an interview.
   One of East Berlin's chief planners has expressed concern about
possible economic ``colonialism'' by the West.
   After much internal bickering, the West Berlin city council has
agreed to take competitive bids in July for a contract to rebuild
the former central district.
   East Berlin will play a role in the decisions only after the
election May 6 of its first democratically chosen city council.
This has caused complaints that East Berliners will have little
time to study documents affecting their part of the city.
   Since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, Potsdamer Platz on one
Western side of it and neighboring Leipziger Platz on the other
have been desolate symbols of a divided country.
   Together, they had been the hub of Berlin and one of Europe's
busiest districts. That ended with the destruction of World War II,
the city's division and the building of the wall.
   Since the wall began falling in November, Potsdamer Platz has
become a major pedestrian crossing point. Motor vehicles use a
newly completed section of four-lane highway linking East Berlin
with streets in the West that were dead ends for a generation.
   Makeshift souvenir stands in Potsdamer Platz sell chunks of the
wall and Soviet military uniforms to tourists. Circus tents and
vans have sprouted on nearby land that is empty most of the year.
   Construction of an apartment block on Leipziger Platz was halted
last fall, when demonstrations and protest ended 40 years of
Stalinist rule.
   An East German border guard said the work stopped when hopes
were aroused that the area might become the center of the city
again, not just another place to build housing complexes.
   He said the West German chain store Wertheim planned to put its
head office on the foundation of the unbuilt apartment house.
   Asked how he felt about Western companies taking choice sites,
he shrugged and said of the planners: ``I just hope they leave us
some green spaces.''
   Other East Germans feel more strongly.
   ``It would be unfair if all the high-tech went to West Berlin
while the East was used for cheap production and storage
facilities,'' said Guenther Stahn, East Berlin's ranking planners.
``That would be a colonialist concept.''
   West Berlin's Social Democratic Party wants to attract
investment to the city as quickly as possible and has welcomed the
Daimler-Benz plan to build a headquarters for 8,000 employees.
   ``We can't afford to keep such an investor waiting,'' Mayor
Walter Momper of West Berlin told his city council recently.
   The Alternative List, coalition partner of the Social Democrats
in the council, does not agree and said in a statement: ``Daimler
is not the star around which Potsdamer Platz plans revolve.''
   Representatives of the Alternative List, the equivalent in West
Berlin of the environmentalist Greens Party, say the Daimler
building would be too dominant in the square. They also argue
against a company that makes armaments occupying such a prime site.
   If construction of the headquarters goes forward as intended in
1992, the Alternative List demands it house a permanent exhibition
on ``the role of the concern during the Nazi years'' and on the
possibility of converting arms production to peaceful uses.
   West Berlin council members agreed in April on the basic outline
of future plans for the city, including priority treatment of
public transport and provision of open, green spaces.
   They did not give Daimler a firm commitment, but said they and
the new East Berlin council elected in May would consider it.

<HEAD>DOE Says Plutonium In Lake Not a Health Risk; Environmentalists
Disagree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presence of plutonium in a lake 40
miles downstream from a government weapons plant shows that the
Department of Energy has been lax in running the facility, an
environmentalist said Tuesday.
   DOE officials at Oak Ridge, where parts for nuclear weapons are
manufactured, described the plutonium pollution in Watts Bar Lake
as ``very small.'' They said it may have come from radioactive
releases decades ago and isn't a health risk.
   Plutonium, one of the deadliest substances known to man, is an
element used in nuclear weapons fuel. Watts Bar Lake is downstream
from both the Tennessee River and the Clinch River, which drains
the Oak Ridge site.
   Clayton Gist of the DOE's environmental protection division in
Oak Ridge said Tuesday that plutonium can be found in sediment
under the lake, and in some instances is suspended in the water.
   He said the level of plutonium is one ten-thousandths the amount
DOE considers a health risk.
   But Ralph Hutchinson of the Center for Global Sustainability, an
environmental group, said any level of plutonium is cause for
concern.
   ``I think there are real questions about how well DOE has
protected the public,'' said.
   The DOE's findings of pollutants in Watts Bar, including cesium
and mercury, were issued earlier this year as part of an on-going
survey of the environmental impact on and around the Oak Ridge
installation, said DOE spokesman Steve Wyatt.
   ``The bottom line on these reports is that this preliminary
analysis indicates no imminent danger to the population,'' Wyatt
said. He said detailed analyses of the environment around Oak Ridge
are done continually.
   ``There are discharges of radioactive material from the site,
there's no question about that,'' Wyatt said. ``These discharges
primarily took place in the early days, in the late 1940s, 50s and
early 60s. Some of the things I've seen make it sound like there
was a leak last Friday. That's not true. ... We aren't talking
about a current practice.''
   The Oak Ridge plant was built as part of the Manhattan Project,
which produced the first atomic bombs during World War II.
   Gist said some of the plutonium may be circulating from the
bottom sediments, and in some cases may been leaching out of old
landfills on the DOE reservation.
   The DOE has been cleaning up those old landfills for several
years, he said.
   Ralph Brooks, manager of the Tennessee Valley Authority's water
resources division, said ``water supplies should not be affected''
by the plutonium.
   He said plutonium has been identified in Watts Bar since at
least 1983. ``We are even more concerned now to find the plutonium
may be more widespread than we thought,'' he said.
   The Oak Ridge site has been placed on the national Superfund
list of hazardous waste sites targeted for cleanup.

   Art dealer Peg Goldberg, who battled
Cyprus over ownership of four 6th-century mosaics, has lost her bid
for re-election as Hamilton County commissioner.
   With 60 of 116 precincts reporting in Tuesday's Republican
primary, challenger William R. Karns had 5,846 votes, or 66
percent, to Goldberg's 3,017, or 34 percent. In heavily Republican
Hamilton County, winning the primary is tantamount to victory.
   Goldberg bought the mosaics for $1.2 million from a Turkish
national living in Switzerland. The church and the Republic of
Cyprus sued her last year, saying the mosaics were national
treasures that were stolen from a church in Turkish-controlled
northern Cyprus.
   She is appealing a federal judge's order to return the Byzantine
mosaics to the Autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus. The
U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago has not yet ruled on
the case.
   Goldberg had said in February she would not run for re-election
until her appeals were exhausted. However, she later changed her
position.
   She ran on a platform calling for a zoning plan for all of the
county, a comprehensive road and drainage program and a new
judicial center.
   Karns is chairman of the board of Karns Inc., a Carmel concrete
company.

   In this dusty town near
the Haitian border, thousands of supporters dance and wave red
flags as the frail, blind president steps from a helicopter for yet
another campaign stop.
   At 82, Joaquin Balaguer is running for a fifth term in the
Dominican Republic's election a week from today. It could be his
last hurrah.
   The conservative leader's chief opponent is Juan Bosch, 80, the
leftist former president who has lost three elections to Balaguer
but this time is favored to win. He has led by 10 points in opinion
polls over the past year.
   They have been political rivals for decades and, once again, the
contest for president is between them.
   Balaguer, a conservative, has served a total of four terms as
president.
   Eight candidates are in the field, but the election has been
seen as a final contest between two men whose names have been
synonymous with politics for half a century in this Caribbean
nation of 7 million people that shares the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti.
   Despite his age, and blindness induced by glaucoma, Balaguer has
whisked around the country by helicopter in an active campaign.
   Thousands of supporters waved red flags of his Social Christian
Reformist Party when Balaguer stopped at Elias Pina during a recent
campaign stop.
   Balaguer is revered in the town as the man who built
pastel-colored apartment houses for the peasants who grow coffee
and cacao in the valley below.
   ``I love him; he is the best president and he must win again,''
said Agripina Diaz Medina, eight months pregnant, who trotted
behind the presidential motorcade.
   For many Dominicans elsewhere, ``Professor Bosch,'' as the
self-educated poet, historian and novelist is known, is the true
spokesman of the people.
   ``Professor Bosch is the only man who cares about the country's
poor, and today we the poor are the majority,'' said Antonio
Gonzalez, a supporter interviewed outside Bosch's Dominican
Liberation Party headquarters in Santo Domingo, the capital.
   After 16 years in office, including three consecutive four-year
terms, Balaguer's popularity has declined with the economy.
   Balaguer began a $2 billion public works program after
re-election in 1986. Critics say he has financed it by printing
money and has neglected public services.
   Among the results are inflation of 50 percent a year, currency
devaluations and electricity blackouts.
   Bosch campaigned as a moderate who would promote a free-market
economy and good relations with the United States, but his
opponents have portrayed him as a dangerous leftist.
   At a recent luncheon of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Santo Domingo, Bosch was asked about his ideology.
   In the process of explaining that he was a Marxist but not a
Communist, Bosch paused for 19 seconds as if trying to gather his
thoughts.
   Video cameras recorded it, and the scene was used in a Balaguer
television commercial, with the announcer saying: ``A man who
thinks like that can't govern the country.'' Then the slogan
``Balaguer, a Road Without Danger'' appeared on the screen.
   Antonio Ocana, an architect and longtime associate, said Bosch
``has memory lapses like everybody, but he has no problems with his
reasoning. We should be worried about having a blind president who
doesn't know what documents he is signing.''
   In 1963, Bosch became the country's first freely elected
president after the assassination of Gen. Rafael Trujillo, a
dictator whose rule spanned 31 years. Bosch spent most of that time
in Cuba and is a close friend of Fidel Castro, who gained power in
1959.
   After seven months in office, Bosch was overthrown and jailed by
leaders of the military, who accused him of being a Communist. A
civil war followed and, in 1965, soldiers supporting Bosch seemed
about to win.
   President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in 23,000 Marines. They stayed
a year, until an election won by Balaguer, a former Trujillo aide.
   Ranked third and fourth in the polls for the May 16 presidential
election are Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a former Santo Domingo
mayor, and former Vice President Jacobo Majluta, who was president
for more than a month in 1982 after President Antonio Guzman
committed suicide.
   Pena Gomez, 52, and Majluta, 55, both belonged to the socialist
Dominican Revolutionary Party until late last year, when fights
over party leadership caused Majluta to leave and form the
Independent Revolutionary Party.
   Majluta ran only 40,000 votes behind Balaguer in 1986.
   About 3.2 million Dominicans are registered to vote for 120
representatives, 30 senators, 104 mayors and 550 councilmen from 18
registered parties. Former President Jimmy Carter is among the
foreign observers.

   The 43rd Cannes Film Festival opening Thursday
offers a world view of the cinema that reflects rapidly changing
events.
   Movies from Eastern Europe, the Far East and Africa are among
the 19 films competing for the Golden Palm award during the 12 days
of competition.
   Saturday will be devoted to ``Europe 90, Cinema Without
Borders'' for meetings and discussions between filmmakers from East
and West, marking new freedoms enjoyed by Eastern Europe's film
industry.
   The prestigious festival also serves as a vast film market and
is expected to draw up to 12,000 industry professionals, 3,000
journalists and hordes of film buffs to the seaside Palais des
Festivals.
   Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci will preside over the jury
of 10, which includes American actress Anjelica Huston, French
actress Fanny Ardant, French director Bertrand Blier and English
screenwriter Christopher Hampton, who adapted ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses'' for the screen.
   The festival will open with an out-of-competition showing of
``Dreams,'' an autobiographical movie by Akiro Kurosawa, the
80-year-old Japanese film master. It closes with another
out-of-competition film, ``Comfort of Strangers,'' by American
director Paul Schrader.
   Three American films are expected to be serious contenders for
the Golden Palm: Clint Eastwood's ``White Hunter, Black Heart,''
David Lynch's ``Wild at Heart'' and ``Come See the Paradise,''
directed by English-born Alan Parker, about a Japanese-American
family interned in a camp during World War II.
   There will be a special out-of-competition showing of ``Cry
Baby,'' starring Patty Hearst and directed by John Waters, the
unconventional director of ``Hairspray.''
   Films by directors from Eastern countries celebrating newly won
freedom are expected to attract attention. These include
``Przesluchanie'' (The Interrogation), by Polish director Ryszard
Bugajski, ``Ucho'' (The Ear) from Czechoslovakia, and an
out-of-competition film from Yugoslavia, ``Umetni Raj,''
(Artificial Paradise) by Karpo Godina.
   The Soviet Union is competing with ``Matj'' (Mother), directed
by Gleb Panfilov, and a French-Soviet co-production of ``Taxi
Blues,'' directed by Pavel Lounguine.
   Competing for France will be Bernard Tavernier's ``Daddy
Nostalgie,'' starring Jane Birkin and Dirk Bogarde, ``La Captive du
Desert,'' (Desert Captive) starring Sandrine Bonnaire and ``Cyrano
de Bergerac,'' starring Gerard Depardieu. Directed by Jean-Paul
Rappeneau, ``Cyrano'' is already a box-office hit in France.
   Also vying for the Golden Palm will be ``New Wave,'' a
Swiss-French co-production directed by the father of new-wave
cinema, Jean-Luc Godard, whose avant garde style was born in the
1960s.
   A Chinese-Japanese entry called ``Ju Dou,'' directed by Chang
Yimou and Yang Fengliang, deals with a troubled marriage of the
1920s.
   The lone British entry is Ken Loach's ``Hidden Agenda,'' a
documentary-style film about troubled Ireland.
   From Burkina Faso, Rasmane Ouedraogo is in competition with a
film called ``Tilai,'' about conflict and love in an African
village.
   Eastwood's ``White Hunter, Black Heart,'' about a director
obsessed with killing an elephant, is expected to attract
attention. Based on a story by Peter Viertel, it was allegedly
inspired by John Huston and the 1952 filming of ``African Queen.''
   Federico Fellini's ``La Voce della Luna'' (The Voice of the
Moon) will be shown out-of-competition.
   Beyond the main competition, the festival also offers an
international selection of films chosen for varying personal
viewpoints grouped under a category called ``Un Certain Regard.''
   The Directors' Fortnight groups 20 films from all over the world
to display the work of new, unknown directors.
   Fans of Fritz Lang and Groucho Marx will be able to enjoy
screenings of their work in special homages commemorating their
100th birth dates.

   Thousands of acres were burning out of
control Tuesday in Michigan's Lower Peninsula, destroying at least
50 houses, prompting evacuations and injuring a firefighter, state
officials said.
   The blaze began about 3:30 p.m., jumped the Au Sable River and
extended northeast to engulf between 1,500 and 2,000 acres, said
John MacGregor, deputy director of the state Department of Natural
Resources office in Crawford County.
   About 250 to 350 people in a 14-square-mile area were evacuated,
including those who lost their homes, as wind gusts of more than 20
mph fanned the flames northeast at nearly 4 mph, authorities said.
   ``We're evacuating the whole area,'' said Lt. Mike Johnson of
the Crawford County Sheriff's Department. ``We've got high wind and
we can't control it. We're calling in everyone we can to help.''
   Bill Mahalak, DNR action regional forest manager, said the
flames destroyed at least 50 homes. Ronald Wilson, DNR chief for
resource protection in Lansing, said at least 2,000 acres are
burning.
   A fire base was set up about seven miles east of Grayling as
firefighters poured in from across the region and from parts of the
Upper Peninsula, said John MacGregor, deputy director of the DNR
office in Crawford County.
   High winds and looming thunderstorms hampered firefighting.
   ``We're waiting for the rain. That's all we can do,'' said DNR
firefighter Doug Pavlovich.
   One firefighter was overcome by smoke and was sent by ambulance
to an area hospital, Johnson said.
   Two others fire were reported covering thousands more acres in
nearby Cheboygan County area.
   Officials in Lansing said the spring fire season is at its worst
as warm winds dry out last year's leaves before this year's growth
has a chance to get started.
   ``I've been terribly nervous,'' said Harry Selleck, manager of
the Muskegon State Park. ``The forest floor is not greening up so
far. It's become a real tinderbox.''

<HEAD>Regulators Trying to Sell S&amp;L Properties Without Disrupting
Markets</HEAD>

   Federal regulators are cutting prices to speed
the sale of property held by failed savings and loans, but they aim
to avoid fire sales that could spook fragile real estate markets.
   ``It's a fine line that has to be walked,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in putting the administration
behind the stepped-up sale of S&amp;L real estate without endorsing the
details of policy changes adopted by regulators Tuesday.
   The board of the Resolution Trust Corp. agreed to allow its
managers to cut prices by 15 percent if a property goes unsold for
six months, or four months for single-family homes.
   A further reduction of 5 percent will be allowed after an
additional three months. A second policy adopted Tuesday authorizes
auction sales, allowing no more than a 30 percent discount from
appraised value.
   The RTC, at the end of February, owned $16.4 billion in real
estate and was expecting its portfolio to mushroom as it
repossessed property posted as collateral for delinquent loans. It
had sold about $2.1 billion worth.
   A Treasury Department-led panel overseeing the RTC's work urged
regulators in a letter to attack the backlog more aggressively.
   ``We would encourage you to allow asset managers to depart from
appraised values more quickly and by greater percentages,'' said
William Taylor, the oversight board's chief staff officer.
   However, at the White House, Fitzwater acknowledged the concerns
of real estate professionals who warn that ``dumping'' properties
may sink shaky markets.
   ``We obviously don't want to wreck the economy,'' he said, but
at the same time, ``We obviously want to get these properties
disposed of.''
   The congressional Joint Economic Committee said Tuesday that the
government's thrift-related spending in 1990 could total $45
billion.
   The faster the repossessed property is sold, the less likely it
is to deteriorate and the lower the government's management costs.
   ``We've become convinced that holding on to property is too
costly both for us and the taxpayer, and what we're adopting is
designed to move properties without disrupting markets,'' RTC
Chairman L. William Seidman said.
   Private economists said real estate investors worried about
dumping may be underestimating the negative effect on prices of the
large backlog of unsold parcels.
   ``Over the last several months, even in depressed markets, there
is less concern about dumping and more recognition of the danger of
overhang,'' said University of Houston professor Paul M. Horvitz.
   The new sales proposal originally came before the RTC board two
weeks ago, but the board delayed action at the urging of
Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, who regulates nationally
chartered banks. Clarke said he feared faster sales could hurt
still-solvent banks and S&amp;Ls struggling with deteriorating real
estate portfolios.
   However, Clarke said an analysis by the RTC's staff convinced
him the new policy would have little effect on solvent institutions.
   ``We've satisfied ourselves that as far as we can tell, and you
can never tell for sure, adoption of this policy would not have an
adverse effect on any of the institutions not in receivership,'' he
said.
   In a related development, the RTC said it has hired a Miami
firm, Auction Company of America, to hold an unprecedented auction
of $200 million to $300 million worth of commercial properties,
each with a value of $1 million. Regulators anticipate holding the
auction in late summer.

   Complaining ``the truth is not coming
out,'' former tennis star Bjorn Borg stormed out of a courtroom
where he is suing a magazine for printing allegations he used
cocaine.
   The weekly Z had published allegations by Borg's former
girlfriend Jannicke Bjorling, who was in a custody dispute with him
over their son. Z's chief editor Jorgen Widsell said three sources
reported Borg had used the drug.
   The five-time Wimbledon champion left the courthouse in a fury
Tuesday after the judge denied his attorney's request to call an
unlisted witness.
   ``This is enough for me. I'm leaving,'' said Borg, who denies he
abused drugs. He rushed past reporters Tuesday and called out, ``I
do not care what you write.''
   The trial continued without him.

   Steven Spielberg, who directed ``E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial,'' has joined the board of directors of The
Planetary Society along with Apollo astronaut Michael Collins.
   Spielberg and Collins ``have helped broaden our perspective
beyond Earth's boundaries to the boundless possibilities of
space,'' said astronomer Carl Sagan, president of the
125,000-member space exploration advocacy group.
   ``In contrast with many earlier films that depicted creatures
from other worlds as invaders bent on destroying or enslaving
mankind, Spielberg debuted warm and wonderful extraterrestrials''
in the 1982 hit ``E.T.'' and the 1977 film ``Close Encounters of
the Third Kind,'' the group said in a statement.
   The producer-director has been involved with The Planetary
Society for years. In the mid-1980s, he donated $100,000 so it
could build a radio receiver in Massachusetts to search for radio
signals from any alien civilizations.
   Collins became the nation's third spacewalker as pilot of Gemini
10. In July 1969 he orbited the moon in the Apollo 11 command
module while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar
surface. He now is an aerospace consultant.

   Harry Truman would be appalled by
presidential politics if he were alive today, co-anchor Jim Lehrer
of ``The MacNeil@Lehrer NewsHour'' says, and he wouldn't be pleased
with journalists, either.
   ``He would be outraged at the way presidents are elected, at the
political campaign process that opens in the mud and closes in the
gutter,'' Lehrer said Tuesday. ``He would be appalled that
candidates are graded on how they handle questions, rather than how
or whether they answer.''
   Lehrer accepted the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award on
behalf of partner Robert MacNeil for the ``NewsHour,'' now in its
14th season on public television.
   The award has been given annually since 1973 on Truman's
birthday. Other recipients have included former President Ford, Dr.
Jonas Salk, Sen. Barry Goldwater and Sen. Howard Baker.
   Lehrer said he believes Truman would be upset about the turns
journalism has taken.
   ``He would be appalled at how somebody named Marla Maples is
made a national celebrity by the press, simply because she had a
relationship with a married millionaire named Donald Trump,'' he
said.

   Former astronaut Alan Shepard and
helicopter pioneer Igor Sikorsky are among six men to be enshrined
Thursday in the National Museum of Naval Aviation's Hall of Honor.
   Shepard, 66, a retired rear admiral, was the first American in
space in 1961. He walked on the moon in 1971.
   Sikorsky, who died in 1972, was an aircraft builder in Russia
and designed commercial seaplanes after emigrating to the United
States. But he is best known as the father of the helicopter
industry.
   The other inductees included Retired Adm. James S. Russell, who
helped develop the Navy's Crusader jet fighter, and George A.
Spangenberg, who headed the Evaluation Division of the Naval Air
Systems Command.
   Two other aviation greats were honored posthumously: Navy Capt.
Henry C. Mustin, who came up with the idea of launching aircraft
from ships with catapults, and Coast Guard Capt. Frank A. Erickson,
a pioneer in helicopter development.

   A jury nearly doubled the amount sought by
singer Tom Waits after finding that Frito-Lay Inc. had used the
soul of his gravelly voice to peddle corn chips.
   The jury Tuesday ordered Frito-Lay to pay Waits almost $2.5
million for imitating his voice in a radio commercial. Waits had
asked for $1.5 million.
   ``Now I have a fence and a gate around my voice,'' said Waits,
40, who has turned down all offers to do commercials.
   ``This was a humiliation to Mr. Waits. They picked on the wrong
guy,'' said Waits attorney Howard King.
   Waits' songs are offbeat paeans to gritty life at the margin,
describing nighthawks at the diner, truck drivers, hard drinkers
and prostitutes in dingy worlds filled with cigarette smoke. He
also has appeared in such films as ``Rumble Fish'' and ``Cotton
Club.''
   Frito-Lay attorney Anthony Liebig had argued Waits wasn't
well-known enough to be imitated.
   ``There is no question he is widely known to extreme insiders in
the rock industry, but that has nothing to do with being known by
the broader segment of the population,'' Liebig said.
   Waits sued Frito-Lay and ad agency Tracy-Locke Inc., which hired
Stephen Carter to sing in ads for Salsa Rio Doritos in 1988.

   Excerpts from Oliver North's notebooks linking
him to George Bush apparently never got to Capitol Hill, and
investigations may be warranted, says the former chairman of the
House Iran-Contra committee.
   Portions of the diaries, released Tuesday, renew questions about
whether then-Vice President Bush was more deeply involved in
assisting the Nicaraguan Contra rebels than he has acknowledged.
   One entry suggests North met with Bush a few hours after the
National Security Council aide lied to the House intelligence
committee on Aug. 6, 1986, by testifying that he wasn't supplying
military aid to the Contras.
   After meeting with the committee, North fielded a complaint
about Felix Rodriguez, a former CIA operative working in North's
resupply network. Rodriguez is a longtime friend of Donald Gregg,
then a national security adviser and now ambassador to South Korea.
   The complaint about Rodriguez is followed by a notebook entry
suggesting that North met with Gregg, according to the newly
released excerpts. Gregg maintains he didn't find out about North's
involvement in the network until Aug. 8, 1986, and that he didn't
tell Bush about it until December 1986 after the Iran-Contra affair
had become public.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who led the House's Iran-Contra
inquiry, said he didn't believe Congress had seen the North
notebook entries referring to Aug. 6 meetings with Bush and Gregg.
   ``It clearly at the very least would raise questions which ought
to have been put at the time to appropriate witnesses,'' Hamilton
said. ``I would have if I had seen them.''
   ``If there is evidence relevant diaries were withheld, redacted
(edited) or blacked out, then I would want'' the House intelligence
or judiciary committees to conduct an investigation, he said.
   ``I would expect the same of the independent counsel,'' he
added, referring to the Iran-Contra prosecutor's office.
   North turned over heavily censored portions of his notebooks in
1987 and the White House released many of those to Congress for its
Iran-Contra probe. But full copies weren't provided to the
government until North was forced to give them to prosecutors at
his trial last year. He retains the original notebooks.
   The 1,400 pages of newly released entries were obtained by a
private research organization, the National Security Archive, as
the result of a lawsuit filed against the government. Intelligence
agencies still are reviewing the remaining 1,200 pages of North's
diaries.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The vice
president's role in the Iran-Contra affair was completely examined
in the congressional inquiry and we have nothing to add.''
   In the newly released notebook entries, North details efforts to
persuade Central American countries to support the Contras.
   A ``3rd Country Solicitation Plan'' lists a planned Central
American trip that Bush, in fact, did take to the inauguration of
Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo.
   The Reagan administration had an elaborate plan to induce third
countries to support the Contras, according to evidence introduced
at North's trial last year. Bush has denied being involved in any
quid pro quo arrangements providing additional economic and
military aid to Honduras in exchange for that country's support of
the Contras.
   Other jottings in North's notebooks:
   _Then-deputy national security adviser John Poindexter said
``deception is required in whatever plan we develop for dealing w
(with) Nicaragua,'' according to North's notebooks for Dec. 5,
1984. Poindexter's comment referred to the Contadora peace process
involving Central American nations.
   _There was ``active surveillance on subject'' near the National
Theater in Washington D.C., according to a June 10, 1986, diary
entry. Peter Kornbluh of the National Security Archive said the
period marked a time of ``paranoia'' at the White House because of
news stories suggesting North's involvement in a Contra resupply
operation during the congressional military aid ban.
   _President Reagan ``does not have enough confidence in''
Secretary of State George Shultz ``to accept his input or to
include him in operational advice,'' North records in a Nov. 17,
1986, meeting, days before the Iran-Contra affair became public.
The meeting was with Alton Keel, deputy director of the National
Security Council.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants See Danger in Radiation, Noise, Beverage Carts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flight attendants are asking federal
authorities to give them more protection against the day-to-day
hazards of working on airliners.
   Cosmic radiation, air pollution, jet engine noise, tobacco
smoke, long working hours and unwieldy beverage carts all pose
hazards to airliner crews, the Association of Flight Attendants
said in a formal petition Tuesday.
   The 30,000-member union asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to adopt the same standards that protect most other
workers under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
   ``They really only care about our safety when it comes to
keeping us alive in a crash so the passengers can be evacuated,''
said Matthew Finucane, the union's director of air safety and
health.
   The union accused the FAA of pre-empting OSHA from protecting
the aviation work place but of failing itself to guard flight
attendants and other crew members against disease and injury in the
sky.
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said the agency had received the
petition and would review it.
   ``We feel our cabin safety program is very successful,'' said
Buckhorn. He said improvements have been made to reduce noise
levels, set flammability standards and install smoke detectors, and
changes are being worked out in duty hour requirements.
   Buckhorn said seminars are planned to assess and deal with the
radiation hazard.
   A Transportation Department study in February estimated that
cosmic radiation could cause one cancer death among 100 crew
members flying for 20 years. Airliner occupants are exposed to
higher radiation from space because there is less atmosphere to
shield them.
   The FAA has drafted a circular warning of possible radiation
danger to crew members who fly long, high-altitude routes
repeatedly over a long period.
   The flight attendants' petition says poorly designed beverage
and food carts weighing 200 pounds or more cause about one injury a
day on U.S. flights.
   It says some flight attendants suffer from ``carpal tunnel
syndrome,'' which spokesman Finucane described as a wrist ailment
caused by repeatedly subjecting the wrist to awkward positions and
stress.
   Finucane said the union has no readily available data on how
many flight attendants have suffered disease or injury.
   ``Crew members are denied certain rights that are guaranteed
workers in other workplaces,'' union President Susan Bianchi-Sand
said in a letter to FAA Administrator James Busey.
   ``It is important not to ignore day-to-day occupational health
and safety issues, since cancer can kill as well as crashes,'' said
Ms. Bianchi-Sand.
   The FAA deals extensively with aviation safety but has no office
to oversee crew health, she said. Buckhorn said both passenger and
crew health issues are handled by cabin safety experts.
   The AFL-CIO has called for broader OSHA protections to include
transportation workers, state and local government employees and
agricultural workers not covered by the 20-year-old act.

<HEAD>House Moves Ahead With Leave Bill Despite Veto Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House Democrats are moving ahead with a bill
guaranteeing unpaid leave to workers for family emergencies despite
a threatened veto by President Bush.
   The White House reaffirmed its opposition to the family and
medical leave act Tuesday as the House scheduled a vote on the bill
for today.
   ``I hope the president will reconsider that,'' said House
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash. ``I believe after the legislation has
been passed ... and the president has a chance to reflect on its
importance to families and preserving the family as an institution,
the president will sign the bill.''
   The bill has Republican and Democratic support. Backers said
they believe they have enough votes to win passage in the House but
are short of the two-thirds necessary to override a veto should it
also pass the Senate.
   Bush's veto threat established a clear division between
congressional Democrats and the president on the second of two
major family-oriented bills before Congress this year. A broader
bill establishing major new spending to help poor and middle-income
families with child care costs awaits resolution of House and
Senate differences and also faces a veto threat.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated a veto threat
made a day earlier by Chief of Staff John Sununu and said the White
House believes the bill would drive up unemployment.
   He said Bush supports companies providing parental leaves
voluntarily but is unwilling to force them to do it.
   At one point in his daily news briefing, Fitzwater suggested
that workers ``look for other jobs'' if they or their unions could
not negotiate parental leave with their employer.
   He later backed off that suggestion. But one of the sponsors,
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., stood on the House floor later to
denounce Fitzwater's comment.
   ``There's a pro-family administration for you,'' she said. ``If
anyone knows where those jobs are, please ring the White House.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she would recommend Bush
veto the bill. She said the bill provides ``no flexibility, no
freedom of choice _ just do it.''
   Foley called it a ``very moderate bill'' because it provides
only for unpaid leave with job protection, with no requirement for
paid benefits.
   Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, the leading Republican
sponsor, said she wanted to meet with Bush about the bill and urged
him not to veto it without hearing from Republican supporters.
   ``Common decency requires that we set up this minimum standard
of job security,'' she said. ``I believe the president will have an
open ear and open heart on this.''
   Roukema blasted ``Washington-based business lobbyists'' as
creating a scare campaign against the bill that she asserted was
out of step with what most businesses were willing to offer their
employees.
   The bill is opposed by business groups including the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
   It would require employers with 50 or more workers to offer
unpaid time off with job and benefit protection for the care of
newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children, as well as to
deal with personal health problems or ill spouses or parents.
   An employee returning from leave would have to be restored to
his or her previous job or an equivalent position. Employers would
have to continue health insurance benefits for those on leave.
   The bill approved by House committees would require leaves of 10
to 15 weeks, depending on circumstances. But sponsors said they
were agreeing to a proposed substitute setting a single category of
leave of up to 12 weeks for care for a new child or sick spouse,
child or parent, or for the employee's own illness. It also would
cover federal workers and congressional staffs.

<HEAD>FEC Says Arizona Companies Allegedly Made Illegal Contributions to
GOP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission is
investigating three related Arizona companies and at least two of
their officers for allegedly making illegal donations to the
Republican Party and Bush presidential campaign.
   The agency's actions were disclosed in documents filed Monday in
U.S. District Court in Phoenix seeking a court order to force the
companies to surrender certain financial records. The agency, as a
rule, refuses to comment on current investigations.
   The FEC's filing said the investigation began late last year and
that a former employee told the agency the two officers were
reimbursed with corporate funds after making donations to the GOP
and Bush campaign. The agency also said corporate letterhead and
postage may have been used to solicit donations on behalf of the
Bush campaign.
   ``Information ... suggests that respondents made corporate
contributions to federal candidates, disguised as contributions
made in other names, and used corporate funds to solicit
contributions to federal candidates,'' the FEC said.
   The companies, all with headquarters at the same address in
Scottsdale, Ariz., are the National Association of Real Estate
Appraisers, the National Association of Review Appraisers and
Mortgage Underwriters and the International Association Managers.
   Individuals named in the complaint are Robert Johnson, executive
director of the groups, and E. Kenneth Twichell, managing director
of the National Association of Real Estate Appraisers.
   Johnson, in a telephone interview, denied any wrongdoing and
said he had provided FEC attorneys all requested documents.
   Johnson said he never reimbursed himself, Twichell or any other
employees for political donations or used corporate letterhead for
fundraising. He said FEC lawyers had refused to provide him with
any evidence of the allegations or name the former employee who
made the allegations.
   ``I believe this investigation is bordering on harassment,'' he
said.
   The FEC, the court papers say, voted unanimously that there was
``reason to believe'' Johnson and Twichell were reimbursed with
corporate funds after making political donations. That would
violate laws prohibiting corporate donations and making
contributions in the name of another.
   The court papers also allege that Twichell sent at least one and
possibly several letters to members of the organizations soliciting
donations for the Bush campaign. Using corporate letterhead and
postage for such a campaign would violate prohibitions against
corporate expenses or donations on behalf of federal candidates.
   Twichell is out of the country, his office said Tuesday.
   The court papers provide few specific details of the alleged
illegal donations.
   FEC records show that Johnson made two donations totaling
$12,000 to the Republican National Committee in June 1988. He also
gave $2,000 to the Bush campaign.
   Twichell, according to FEC records, donated $1,000 to the Bush
campaign in January 1988 and $10,000 in July of that year to the
RNC.

<TEXT>
   Perhaps no one has eaten so well for so long as
Craig Claiborne.
   For three decades as food editor of The New York Times,
Claiborne had access to the best meals being served. Anywhere.
   In Mississippi, during a childhood of grits and beaten biscuits
and black-eyed peas in the kitchen of his mother's boardinghouse.
In Switzerland, as a student at the Professional School of the
Swiss Hotel Keepers Association.
   In China, Hong Kong and countless top restaurants in Europe.
Even in his own kitchen on Long Island, where many great chefs came
to him.
   A turning point was a meal of couscous in Casablanca during
World War II. ``I flipped. I went crazy about couscous,'' he said
in an interview Tuesday at his mid-Manhattan apartment as he peered
characteristically over reading glasses.
   That meal, he said in his autobiography, ``I swear to this day
gave me my initial, unquenchable interest in food and food
preparation.''
   Claiborne, 69, published his first book, ``The New York Times
Cookbook,'' in 1961, four years after he became the newspaper's
first male food editor.
   He expected to sell around 15,000 books. He slept little, always
expecting a call in the middle of the night from an irate cook
trying to make ``the macaroni and cheese on page 152 and it doesn't
work.''
   Eventually, 3 million copies were sold. And the book has become
a dog-eared, authoritative companion to Fannie Farmer or ``Joy of
Cooking'' in many kitchens.
   This time, 20 books later, he has become one of the nation's
most influential food writers and is sleeping nights despite
publication of an extensively revised edition of ``The New York
Times Cookbook'' (Harper &amp; Row, $25).
   ``When I first joined the Times, the ultimate thing in food was
French cooking,'' and the ultimate dish was pike quenelles in
lobster sauce, he said. There was just one Japanese restaurant in
Manhattan.
   The new book was the result of a revolution in food.
   ``Back in those days, no one ever heard of a pesto sauce or
sun-dried tomatoes, and the only mustard was ballpark mustard,'' he
said. ``Americans thought tuna came out of a can and that was it.''
   Balsamic vinegar, ``one of the greatest additions to American
culture where food is concerned,'' arrived from Italy.
   All sorts of salad greens. Regional American, Thai, Vietnamese
food.
   And California cuisine, ``if you could tell me what that is,
thank you,'' he said with a smirk.
   There have been other changes, such as the food processor. It
was a gadget Claiborne in 1972 predicted never would go over with
American consumers.
   One takes up some of the tiny bit of counter space in
Claiborne's Manhattan kitchen, which has just a two-burner gas
stove and a small convection oven. One wall is covered with copper
pots and iron pans and two telephones.
   A head of cabbage, a few red potatoes, two tomatoes and some
onions sat on the counter, but Claiborne said he rarely cooks
there, preferring his 5,000-square-foot home in Easthampton, on
Long Island.
   It was in that professional-quality kitchen where he tested
recipes for his new book.
   Claiborne and his editor, Joan Whitman, attacked the first book,
weeding out the likes of frankfurter goulash, cutting some fats and
salt, and adding more pasta and Asian dishes, fresh tuna and a
black olive puree for pasta. Forty percent of the recipes are new.
   Many old standards _ even some with beef or butter, or both _
remain. At a recent book signing, he said, a rather frantic woman
ran up to ask if herbal meatloaf had made the cut. It had. He was
relieved.
   Claiborne himself, however, has for 10 years, after a diagnosis
of high blood pressure, restricted his fat and salt. ``I follow the
basic guidelines, but I give myself latitude.''
   Breakfast is nearly always juice and yogurt; lunch ``almost
always'' is fresh tomato soup (recipe page 72 of the new book),
toast, Gorgonzola cheese and panforte; and dinner is pasta, a
hamburger or a dish such as Wiener schnitzel.
   His next project, he said, is a book on table manners and
settings for use professionally and in the home. Admittedly
opinionated on the matter, he cites all manner of violations he has
witnessed.
   ``On an airline, it drives me crazy when they say, `Would you
care for wine or champagne?' ... They should say still wine or
champagne.'' Or, table candles with the flame at eye level. Waiters
who touch the rim of a glass. Table settings that are not strictly
uniform.
   ``I have seen educated adults pick their teeth at the table,''
he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Retreats on `No New Taxes'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Budget Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush appears to have concluded that
economy-crippling budget cuts pose a greater political threat to
Republicans than a broken ``no new taxes'' campaign promise.
   Bush has changed positions over the years, or at least shown
``flexibility,'' on a range of topics _ from abortion rights to
arms control to dealing with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to global warming.
   However, few pledges have been etched as keenly in recent
political consciousness as Bush's 1988 ``read my lips _ no new
taxes'' assertion. And, even as recently as last month, Bush was
telling Republican audiences he would resist Democratic efforts to
raise taxes.
   Republican candidates clearly are squirming over the notion of
tax increases in an election year. ``I'm not going to vote for
anything which causes us to lose politically,'' said Assistant
House Republican Leader Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   But White House strategists apparently decided that the economic
fallout from massive budget cuts _ resulting from a failure to
reach a budget compromise _ could be an even bigger political
liability.
   So, having first put Democrats in a box by continually accusing
them of seeking to raise taxes, Bush had little choice but to take
the initiative on tax increases himself.
   He did that this week with his ``no preconditions'' budget talks
overture to Congress, followed by sessions with lawmakers that
included the first serious exploration of tax options in his
presidency.
   At the same time, budget director Richard Darman was dispatched
to Capitol Hill to deliver bad news.
   A sluggish economy and previous underestimates of the cost of
the savings and loan bailout will mean the government may miss
deficit targets by $60 billion to $100 billion this fall, Darman
told lawmakers on Tuesday.
   Although Darman suggested that a $100 billion shortfall was ``an
extreme case,'' the underlying message was clear.
   Few close to the budget process in Washington have any illusions
that $60 billion to $100 billion can be whacked from the budget
through belt-tightening alone.
   And yet, if some mix of spending cuts and higher taxes can't be
assembled and enacted, across-the-board spending cuts in defense
and most domestic programs will take place on Oct. 1. That's the
start of the new fiscal year and just a month before 1990
congressional elections.
   Although some programs would be exempt _ such as Social Security
benefits and interest payments on the national debt _ the impact of
such cuts throughout the government could have a crippling effect
on an already fragile economy.
   Darman has estimated that cuts of over 20 percent could result.
By contrast, when across-the-board cuts took effect last year when
Congress failed to meet deficit targets, the cuts amounted to less
than 5 percent.
   The Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law requires the federal
deficit _ now expected to swell to near $200 billion this year _ to
be reduced to $100 billion during the current fiscal year and to
$64 billion by next year.
   The White House, after opening the door to tax increases, is now
trying to close it just enough to minimize political damage.
   Thus, Darman said that while Bush is open to discuss any
proposal ``there are some ideas we're not prepared to put on the
table.''
   However, Democratic leaders are suggesting that the president
had better spell out just what kind of taxes he can support, if he
expects to win their cooperation in forging a serious bipartisan
compromise.
   Budget summits between the White House and Congress have taken
place before, but they have produced few concrete results.
   This year may be different because of the seriousness with which
Bush is approaching the issue and the magnitude of the deficit
problem, suggests former Rep. Thomas Ashley, D-Ohio.
   ``I think there is a greater prospect of deliverability on both
sides this year,'' Ashley said. ``Last year, I don't think either
the White House or Congress was in a position to attack the
politically sensitive issues.''
   Ashley, a former member of the House Budget Committee who speaks
regularly with Bush, said deficit cuts such as those required this
year cannot be achieved without new taxes.
   Is Bush really ready to abandon his campaign pledge and support
some form of tax increase? Ashley said yes.
   ``One thing is clear, the White House is not saying `everything
is on the table' because it has a ring to it. They have to be
willing to deal,'' he said.

   CBS loves Lucy plenty. She helped it into a
neck-and-neck race for the top-rated network after a 15-month slump.
   CBS' broadcast of ``I Love Lucy, The Very First Show,'' tied
with ABC's ``Roseanne'' as the most watched show on television last
week, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures released Tuesday.
   And for the first time since February of 1989, CBS nearly caught
up with NBC in the race to be the No. 1 network. CBS missed a
first-place tie by only one tenth of a ratings point.
   It was the closest CBS has come to No. 1 since it tied with NBC
during CBS' broadcast of the epic mini-series ``Lonesome Dove.''
   The never-before-televised 39-year-old ``I Love Lucy'' pilot,
made while Lucille Ball was six months pregnant with Lucie Arnaz,
received a 21.2 rating.
   In the overall network battle, NBC finished first with 12.1. CBS
had an even 12, ABC an 11.3. Each ratings point represents 921,000
households.
   There was more for CBS to rejoice about during the May
``sweeps,'' one of four periods during the year whose ratings are
used to determine stations' advertising rates.
   After months of being in last place, the network had four shows
in the top 10: ``60 Minutes'' ranked seventh, the movie ``The
Untouchables'' Sunday night was ninth and ``Designing Women''
finished 10th.
   The sniping families on Fox Broadcasting's ``The Simpsons'' and
``Married ... With Children'' continue to bicker their way up the
ratings, placing 19th and 21st respectively.
   And ``Twin Peaks'' on ABC, despite its standing as one the most
ballyhooed series in TV history, continues to sag in the ratings,
this time finishing 44th.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating:
   ``I Love Lucy, The Very First Show,'' CBS, tie with
``Roseanne,'' ABC, 21.2; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 21.1; ``America's
Funniest Home Videos, ABC, 20.6; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 18.5; ``A
Different World,'' NBC, 18.1; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 18; ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC, 17.5; ``The Untouchables'' Sunday Night Movie,
CBS, 17.1 and ``Designing Women,'' CBS, 17.
   The revival of ``Elvis'' is still dead in the ratings, ranking
82nd, while ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' on Fox maintained its
last-place status.
   In the network news battle, ABC and Peter Jennings came in first
with 9.5. Dan Rather and CBS were second with 8.5. NBC and Tom
Brokaw were last with 8.3.

   Shai Gross vividly recalls those
terrifying moments as a six-year-old hostage, crouching beneath his
mother's dress to hide from armed hijackers who commandeered an Air
France jetliner to Africa.
   A week later, Gross and his parents were among the 102
passengers rescued in a legendary Israeli commando raid at Entebbe
Airport, Uganda, on July 4, 1976. Three hostages and an Israeli
soldier were killed in the raid.
   His story is one of the dramatic accounts told Tuesday night at
a reunion of the more than 100 soldiers and former hostages
involved in Israel's bold rescue of the civilian captives.
   The gathering at a seaside hotel was called to launch a college
scholarship fundraising drive in memory of Lt. Col. Yonatan
Netanyahu, the mission commander killed at age 30 in the raid.
   ``I couldn't even cry,'' said Gross, 20, now an air force
technician, referring to his memories of the eight days he spent at
gunpoint. ``I didn't know what struck me. I had never before seen a
grenade or a gun.''
   Yitzhak Rabin, who was then prime minister, compared the Entebbe
crisis to current efforts to free captives in Lebanon.
   ``My policy has been that when you have a hostage situation,
soldiers or civilians, if there's a military option, you use it. If
not, then enter an exchange deal. For that you have to have the
cards,'' Rabin said.
   Despite U.S. pressures on Israel to free Arab prisoners for
hostages, Israel has conditioned any deal on the release of three
Israeli soldiers believed held captive by pro-Iranian militants in
Lebanon.
   Rabin said planning and executing the Entebbe rescue mission was
a nerve-wracking affair.
   ``I suffered more than a few stomachaches over that decision. So
many options were proposed and ruled out,'' he said. In the raid,
Israeli aircraft flew 2,400 miles to rescue the hostages and
engaged Ugandan troops in battle.
   The hijacked Air France flight, carring 244 passenger and 12
crew, had originated in Tel Aviv. It was commandeered by three
terrorists after a stopover in Athens on June 27, 1976. The Marxist
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed
responsibility for the hijacking.
   The aircraft was first taken to Benghazi, Libya and then flown
to Entebbe. Non-Israeli passengers were freed and hijackers
demanded the release of Arab prisoners in exchange for the rest.
   Gross remembers that within minutes of commandeering the plane,
the hijackers, a German woman and two Arabs, took children to the
front of the plane.
   He recalled his fear at the thought of separation. ``What would
they do to me,'' he said. ``My mother took me right away and hid me
beneath her dress, under the seat. I sat there 2{ hours,
petrified.''
   He said the rescue was also frightening since hostages were
unaware at the first that the shooting they suddenly heard in the
terminal _ to which they had been taken from the airplane _ was by
Israeli soldiers.
   Once troops burst into the building, Gross said, ``I remember my
father grabbed a mattress and covered me with it. We were all sure
we were going to be killed.''
   He said he had nightmares for months afterwards and shunned air
travel. ``I still don't like to tell these stories, never.''
   The Israeli rescue came within hours of the hijackers' deadline
and lasted 53 minutes on the ground. It was planned in less than 40
hours, commanders said.
   In an airport clash with Ugandan troops, the U.S.-born Netanyahu
was shot and killed by a sniper in the control tower.
   Another Israeli soldier was permanently paralyzed from the neck
down by a gunshot wound sustained during a diversionary maneuver.
   Three hostages and all the hijackers were killed as well as 20
Ugandan guards. A 75-year-old hostage, Dora Bloch, had been
hospitalized and was not with the hostages at the time of the raid.
She was later killed by Ugandan secret police.
   Pilot Amnon Halivni, who flew the hostages home in a C-130
Hercules turboprop, recalled the furious airport battle. ``Bullets
flew everywhere. It was a pyrotechnics such as I've never seen,''
he said.
   He said the pilots were concerned that all the hostages would
not be able to board the aircraft for a quick take-off.
   ``We were worried some of them, children, would just run away
frightened, and how would we ever know if we had all of them?''
Halivni said.

   The Bush administration is touting Bolivia's
record levels of cocaine eradication, even while acknowledging that
the country is attaining greater prominence as an illegal narcotics
center.
   Bolivia has moved up as a cocaine-processing locale because
traffickers are moving their operations from neighboring Colombia
where a full-scale crackdown has been in effect for many months,
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson said Tuesday.
   Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora pressed President Bush on
Tuesday for more U.S. anti-drug money, saying Bolivia can do a
better job on eradication, said Paz's economic counselor, Samuel
Doria Medina.
   ``We can eradicate more rapidly if there is more money,'' Doria
said in an interview.
   While his government likes the administration's $150 million
economic aid package for next year, Paz in his meeting with Bush
``mentioned that we can accelerate the program of substitution for
coca leaves if we can have additional money,'' said Doria.
   Some of the aid is earmarked for a program under which farmers
who agree to stop growing coca leaves are given an $800-per-acre
credit for switching to another crop.
   Doria said the two governments agreed to set up a task force to
look into the possibilities.
   The Bolivians eradicated 9,100 acres of coca in the first four
months of this year, compared with 6,200 acres in all of 1989,
Aronson said. They seized 3.5 tons of cocaine paste from January
through April, compared with 4 tons for all of last year.
   Asked whether the increased eradication was due to stepped-up
cocaine activity in Bolivia, Aronson said, ``It is possible, and
partly what you're seeing is that as the Colombians crack down on
the cartels and make life difficult for them in Colombia, some of
them are moving their operations to Brazil.''
   During the Paz visit, the two nations also agreed to sign a new
trade and investment pact and a three-year $60 million food aid
program, said Aronson.
   The United States also promised medical help for Bolivia to
suppress the insect-carried Chagas disease, Aronson said.
   As Paz left the White House, Bush assured him in a brief speech:
``You and your countrymen will not stand alone in the fight against
cocaine or in the drive for economic development ... Together we're
going to wage a strong fight.''
   Bush also said that if current eradication efforts continue,
``Bolivia may be able to eliminate all coca grown within its border
for illegal use.''
   Aronson said some 99,000 acres of coca crops still are growing
in the country's heaviest production area.
   The Bolivians stressed their need for ``alternative
development'' to shift the economy from its cocaine dependence
through creation of jobs, income and foreign exchange.
   Paz told Bush in departure remarks that his countrymen ``are
fervent allies and we are ready to give you all of our efforts and
all of our cooperation ... to everything that would be of a common
interest.''
   The new trade and investment agreement is similar to one the
United States has with Mexico, in which trade officials from both
countries consult on issues such as problems U.S. firms may have in
trying to invest in Bolivia, or Bolivian problems in trying to
export to the United States, said Aronson.
   The administration promised technical assistance against the
widespread Chagas disease, which is carried by a ``kissing bug''
and is similar to African sleeping sickness.

   There's plenty of rain to go around, but some
farmers are getting too much and others too little.
   Rain and sodden fields are hampering many as they try to plant
corn and other crops this spring. Others, particularly in parts of
the parched northern Great Plains, are wishing they had more rain.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility reported Tuesday that
corn planting nationally was about 50 percent completed, trailing
normal progress by 3 percentage points. Cotton planting was 39
percent completed, down five points from the usual pace for this
time.
   But corn producers in Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio were able to make
up for earlier delays, planting about one-third of their acreage
during the week of April 30-May 6.
   ``Rain slowed planting in Kentucky and Missouri,'' the report
said. ``Planting lagged 41 points behind the 76 percent average in
Missouri. Plant ing also lagged behind normal in Illinois and
Colorado.''
   Cotton farmers were held up by rain and wet fields in Arkansas,
Missouri, Tennessee and Texas.
   However, cotton planting ``progressed rapidly'' in Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi and the Carolinas, and was nearly finished
in Arizona and California, the report said.
   ``Dry weather prevailed over most of the northern Great Plains
and the West, where soil moisture was generally
short-to-adequate,'' the report said.
   Winter wheat was said to be generally in ``good to fair''
condition, with 23 percent of the crop headed, six percentage
points behind the five-year average.
   ``The percentage of acreage headed lagged 10 or more points
behind normal in Illinois, Kansas and Missouri,'' the report said.
``In Kansas, insect and disease problems were light-to-moderate,
and crop condition was good-to-excellent.''
   Oklahoma's winter wheat was rated good, but heavy rains have
flooded some low-lying areas. Heavy rains also have caused flooding
along the Arkansas River in Arkansas, where crop conditions were
reported fair-to-good.
   Planting of spring wheat for this year's harvest was 75 percent
completed, 10 points ahead of the normal pace, the report said.
Seeding was complete in South Dakota and almost finished in Idaho.
Planting was 62 percent completed in North Dakota, three percentage
points ahead of normal.
   The weather facility is operated jointly by the Agriculture and
Commerce departments. Weekly reports about weather and crop
conditions do not include production estimates or forecasts.

   The Agriculture Department has given the
Soviet Union another go-ahead to buy more U.S. grain.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder said Tuesday that Moscow now
has permission to buy up to 22 million metric tons of U.S. grain
without further consultations, an increase of 2 million tons.
   A long-term grain agreement between the two countries specified
initially that Moscow could buy up to 12 million tons of grain a
year without further U.S. approval. That limit was raised to 16
million tons last October and to 20 million tons in December.
   The new limit of 22 million tons applies to the 12-month period
that began last Oct. 1. The agreement itself runs through Dec. 31.
   Officials said the increase in the ``consultation level'' of the
agreement resulted from talks with the Soviets in recent days and
also takes into consideration recent large purchases of corn by
Moscow.
   In all, since Oct. 1, the Soviet Union has bought about 18.9
million tons of corn and wheat for delivery in 1989-90.
   Those orders include more than 15.6 million tons of corn and 3.3
million tons of wheat. Purchases also include 342,300 tons of
soybeans, 1.2 million tons of soybean meal, and 7,300 tons of
barley.
   In 1988-89, sales were a record of more than 21.7 million tons,
including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4
million tons of wheat.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.

   Milk production dropped last year, but higher
prices boosted sales receipts of dairy farmers to a record level,
according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Overall, milk output in 1989 declined 1 percent to about 144.3
billion pounds from a record of 145.2 billion pounds in 1988, the
report said Tuesday. But cash receipts from milk sales rose 10
percent to $19.4 billion, eclipsing the old record of $18.5 billion
set in 1983.
   Milk production has been rising this year in response to higher
prices and may edge up by 1 percent to 3 percent in 1990, possibly
to another record level, according to USDA forecasters.
   The annual report showed that actual marketings of milk in 1989
totaled about 142.1 billion pounds, down from 142.9 billion in
1988. About 2.1 billion pounds were used on farms where produced,
including milk fed to calves and used by dairy-producer families.
   About 141.1 billion pounds of the milk marketed was sold to
plants and dealers for more than $19.1 billion, an average of
$13.56 per 100 pounds, the report said.
   More than 497 million quarts (about two pounds each) were sold
directly to consumers for an average of 53.9 cents per quart. Those
receipts totaled $267.9 million.
   The average number of milk cows in 1989 was reported at
10,127,000 head, down from 10,262,000 the year before. But average
milk production rose to 14,244 pounds per cow last year from 14,145
in 1988.

<HEAD>Calderon Inauguarated as President of Costa Rica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following in his father's footsteps,
Rafael Angel Calderon donned the presidential sash doffed by Nobel
laureate Oscar Arias, then promised his countrymen fiscal vigilance
and austerity.
   ``Exactly 50 years ago my father was sworn in, before these same
altars of God and the fatherland,'' he told a crowd of 50,000
attending Tuesday's ceremony at the national soccer stadium.
   Calderon outlined a government of national consensus in which
private enterprise will be the motor of what he termed ``economic
democracy.''
   But he also lamented the large federal budget deficit _ 6
percent of the GNP _ and said austerity measures would have to be
adopted during his first year in office to prevent a rise in
inflation.
   First Lady Barbara Bush headed the U.S. delegation to the
inauguration. Seven heads of state, including Calderon's four
Central American colleagues, were on hand.
   Mrs. Bush thanked the people of Costa Rica for their warmth and
hospitality before departing for Washington on Tuesday evening.
   ``I have fallen in love with the people of Costa Rica and the
Calderon family,'' especially the four children, she said. Mrs.
Bush had breakfast with the family before the inauguration ceremony.
   Calderon, a 41-year-old lawyer, has been in politics since the
age of 16.
   He hailed Arias' work on behalf of peace in Central America. The
outgoing president was awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for
authoring a plan that has promoted, although not completely
achieved, peace in the region.
   ``Halfway down the road toward peace, it is incumbent upon us,
the presidents of the region, to go on to a new phase of the
process in which the great goal will not be to silence the roar of
the cannons but to finally lift ourselves toward economic
development,'' Calderon said.
   He quoted Pope Paul VI in saying that in modern times,
``development is the new name for peace.'' Calderon said his
government would encourage the creation of thousands of
``mini-enterprises,'' many of them linked to Costa Rica's
burgeoning tourism industry.
   Calderon's Party of Social Christian Unity has accused Arias'
social democratic National Liberation Party of fostering an
oversized and inefficient state apparatus. He vowed to ``impose
order on public finances.''
   The Social Christians are slightly to the right of the Social
Democrats. The similarly centrist ideology of the two parties has
been a major factor in keeping the nation of 3 million stable and
democratic during decades of turmoil and totalitarianism in Latin
America.
   ``There are economic world powers and military world powers. We
only aspire to consolidate ourselves as a world power of
disarmament and human rights,'' said Calderon.
   Calderon, who lost presidential bids in 1982 and 1986, defeated
Liberation candidate Manuel Castillo in a February election.
   The constitution forbade Arias, whom polls gave a 90 percent
approval rate at the end of his presidency, from seeking another
term.
   Calderon founded the Social Christian party in part to shed the
legacy of his father, Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia, who was exiled
in 1948 for trying to nullify the presidential vote that year.
   After a 40-day revolution, the army was abolished and the
Calderon family sent into exile.
   Calderon calls his father, who served as president from 1940 to
1944, the greatest Costa Rican president of this century. The elder
Calderon was a great social reformer, having founded Costa Rica's
social security system.
   In his campaign, Calderon tried to take advantage of his
father's image as a reformer without raising the events of 1948.

<HEAD>White-Collar Sentencing Plan Not Abandoned, Attorney General Says</HEAD>

   Proposed tougher sentences for corporate
criminals require more study before receiving Justice Department
support, but have not been abandoned, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh says.
   ``The difference here was that there were not adequately
reviewed _ they were not repudiated but were simply withdrawn for
further study,'' Thornburgh told a Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing.
   He promised to issue a tough-minded recommendation on sentences
for white-collar criminals but said he had no deadline for doing so.
   Prosecution of ``crime in the suites'' has been a theme of
Thornburgh's tenure at the Justice Department. His aides
acknowledged last month that he withdrew support for the guidelines
at the request of the White House.
   The request reportedly followed heavy lobbying by defense
contractors, oil companies and others who saw the proposals as
something very much like a ``corporate death penalty'' for several
firms.
   The U.S. Sentencing Commission produced the guidelines last
fall. They would require federal judges to impose stiff fines on
companies convicted of polluting, fraud and other white-collar
offenses.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that when the Justice
Department withdrew its support he was ``concerned that the
Department of Justice has surrendered so easily to pressure from
the White House and big business to go soft on white-collar crime.''
   Thornburgh declared that he is adamantly opposed to soft
treatment for white-collar criminals. ``I stand second to none in
pressing for nothing less than the maximum penalties that we can
accommodate under the law,'' he said.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said, however, that criminals
who are members of ``the country-club set'' frequently get off the
hook. ``Your prosecutors are wheeling and dealing constantly
without anyone going to the slammer,'' he told Thornburgh.
   ``I think you'd have a hard time explaining that to Woody
Lemons,'' Thornburgh replied. Lemons, the former chairman of a
Texas savings and loan, was recently sentenced to 30 years in
prison, the stiffest sentence so far in the probe of massive fraud
in the thrift industry.
   Thornburgh promised to get Metzenbaum a list of white-collar
offenders who have been sentenced to prison. ``I will hope to
disabuse you of what is obviously a mistaken view,'' he said.

   A jury found The Dallas Morning News did not set
out to wreck its rival in obtaining 26 comics and features that had
been running in the Dallas Times Herald.
   The Harris County jury voted 10-2 on Tuesday to reject the Times
Herald's claim for at least $33 million in damages.
   The Times Herald had contended The Morning News and its parent,
the A.H. Belo Corp., violated antitrust laws by taking over the
features in a move to drive the Times Herald out of business.
   The features, which ran in the Times Herald until last fall,
included Doonesbury, The Far Side, Dear Abby and Erma Bombeck.
   Times Herald attorney Wayne Fisher said the newspaper will
appeal.
   ``We disagree that the conduct of our competitor was legal or
proper in any way,'' the paper said in a statement. ``In fact, it
was wrong in many ways _ wrong morally, wrong ethically, wrong for
the profession of journalism and wrong for Dallas and its people.''
   Belo Chairman Robert Decherd said: ``The most important thing
now is for our two companies to go about making the best newspapers
we can and benefit the communities we serve. We feel strongly we've
been vindicated.''
   Decherd denied The Morning News intended to drive the Times
Herald out of business.
   ``The Dallas market can support two vibrant, lively
newspapers,'' he said. ``I still believe that.''
   The Morning News said it obtained the comics and features as
part of a joint venture with Universal Press Syndicate Inc. of
Kansas City, the distributor of the features, to get into the TV
programming business.
   Witnesses for Belo and the syndicate testified that Universal
Press required all its features in the Times Herald be moved to The
Morning News as part of the venture.
   The venture will use syndicate comics characters in TV programs
and commercials to encourage newspaper readership.
   The Times Herald had asked for $33 million in actual damages and
unspecified punitive damages. The $33 million would have been
tripled had the Times Herald been successful in its lawsuit.
   The Times Herald had estimated the loss of the features cost it
a permanent circulation drop of 10,800.
   In testimony, Morning News attorneys referred to circulation
figures showing the Times Herald's circulation was slightly higher
than before the features were moved.
   But Times Herald officials testified that to stop the
circulation slide, they had begun a $1 million reader lottery
promotion. When the promotion ends, their witnesses said,
circulation could slide.
   As of March 31, The Morning News had a daily morning circulation
of 355,633, according to figures filed with the Audit Bureau of
Circulation. The Times Herald had a daily circulation of 222,416.

   The trust funds that are financed by taxes on
gasoline and airplane tickets should be considered in calculating
the federal deficit, a Transportation Department official says.
   ``If we can agree that we must not lose sight of the total
federal deficit, I think we must then agree that we cannot ignore
trust fund spending in setting the annual federal budget,''
Assistant Transportation Secretary Kate L. Moore told a House
subcommittee Tuesday.
   She was scheduled to testify again today before a Senate public
works panel. Members of Congress with jurisdiction over public
works spending are being pressured by states, the aviation industry
and contractors in particular to release money from those funds for
much-needed building and repair.
   Moore was referring to the two funds _ paid for by taxes on
fuel, tires, cargo and airline tickets _ which are supposed to be
dedicated to spending on public works such as highways, bridges and
air traffic control.
   Critics say the funds balances are kept artificially high to
mask the size of the deficit. Some members of Congress want the
funds removed from deficit calculations in order to stop that
alleged abuse.
   Congress controls the flow of money from the two accounts: the
Aviation Trust Fund and the Highway Trust Fund. The amount of money
that is released in a given year typically falls short of the value
of the projects. The highway money goes to states, which administer
highway programs.
   The two separate funds have a combined cash balance of about $25
billion, but there is disagreement over how much is really an
uncommitted surplus.
   There is also disagreement over how much of the Aviation Trust
Fund should be spent on operations of the Federal Aviation
Administration rather than on capital equipment.
   The Bush administration wants to raise the airline passenger
ticket tax from 8 percent to 10 percent in order to finance
modernization of the air traffic control system and increase the
share of FAA operations financed by the fund.
   The National Aviation Safety Plan, as the modernization is
known, is behind schedule and $4 billion more expensive than
anticipated.

<HEAD>Soviet Says U.S. Opposition to Naval Arms Talks Could Harm Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continued U.S. opposition to naval arms talks
could undermine U.S.-Soviet ties and derail future negotiations to
cut strategic and conventional weapons, says the Soviet Union's
chief arms control adviser.
   Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev issued his warning before a
congressional panel Tuesday, and added a new wrinkle to Moscow's
call for negotiations over a ban on short-range nuclear weapons in
the superpower navies.
   Akrhomeyev, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's principal arms
control adviser, said his country would be willing to include
land-based aircraft used to protect its navy in naval arms talks.
   ``We think that nuclear weapons of all kinds of systems at sea
should be the subject of negotiations,'' he said. ``In other words,
the nuclear systems which are deployed on aircraft carriers, on
submarines and on aviation.''
   But the overriding issue is President Bush's rejection of the
Soviet's plea for naval negotiations, Akhromeyev said.
   At the Malta summit last December, Gorbachev pressed Bush on
such talks but the administration turned down the request, arguing
that the United States must remain a naval power.
   Akhromeyev told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that U.S.
opposition to naval arms talks could jeopardize significant cuts in
armed forces and weapons down the road.
   ``We consider that sooner or later if we do not want to stop the
negotiations on reduction of nuclear and conventional arms, naval
forces cuts negotiations are unavoidable,'' he said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the projection forces
and regional defense subcommittee, invited Akhromeyev to appear
before the panel to discuss naval arms reductions.
   Members of the subcommittee expressed reservations about
imposing limitations on U.S. naval forces.
   ``I am opposed to limiting the qualitative or quantitative naval
forces,'' said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on
the Armed Services Committee and a former secretary of the Navy.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said any reduction in the United
States' access to sea lanes is ``tantamount to losing oxygen to our
lungs,'' and added the arms control agenda is already overloaded.
   Akhromeyev also said the issue of whether the Soviets should
give up their SS-24 nuclear missile if the United States scraps the
rail-based, multiple-warhead MX missile should be addressed in
talks once a treaty to reduce strategic weapons by 50 percent is
signed.
   ``It would be good if experts of our countries in this issue ...
really studied this prior to getting into those future
negotiations. That issue is already on the agenda of the day,'' he
said.
   On another issue, Akhromeyev said the Soviet Union did not
violate the U.S.-Soviet agreement in December 1987 to eliminate
short-range nuclear weapons even though some SS-23 missiles have
been found in East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   Akhromeyev said the missiles, minus nuclear warheads, were sold
to those nations before the treaty was signed and thus do not
violate the pact.

<HEAD>New Dumping Rules Set, Criticized</HEAD>

   Industry soon will have to comply with new
federal requirements when disposing of toxic industrial wastes on
land, but environmentalists contend the rules don't go far enough
to curb pollution.
   ``It gives the green light to continue dumping billions of
gallons of untreated hazardous waste down deep wells,'' said Jane
Bloom, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Other critics of the new regulations announced Tuesday by the
Environmental Protection Agency said the requirements will only
lead to new Superfund toxic wastes sites in the years to come.
   The EPA's long-awaited regulations, in development for six
years, call on industry by 1992 to comply fully with new treatment
requirements for more than 40 million tons of toxic waste that are
dumped onto the ground surface or injected into deep wells.
   ``These rules will keep significant quantities of hazardous
waste off the land, preventing the future groundwater contamination
and assuring safe management of these wastes,'' said Donald Clay,
the EPA's assistant administrator in charge of hazardous waste
regulation and the Superfund cleanup program.
   But several environmental groups and an industry group
representing waste-treatment companies strongly criticized the
agency action, saying it was too weak to assure the environment
will be protected.
   ``This action clearly shows the EPA's purported commitment to
pollution prevention is merely lip service,'' said Ms. Bloom, of
the Washington-based NRDC.
   Richard C. Fortuna, executive director of the Hazardous Waste
Treatment Council, said the EPA action, designed to curb the land
disposal of untreated toxic chemicals, instead ``ensures that the
waste management practices of today will become the Superfund sites
of tomorrow.''
   The critics said that while the regulations impose new treatment
requirements for some toxic wastes, they also will allow industry
to dispose of acidic and solvent wastes through dilution rather
than special treatment to reduce the toxicity.
   The environmentalists and other critics also said the EPA action:
   _Exempts toxic chemicals that go to wastewater treatment
facilities or are injected into deep wells from special treatment
requirements, requiring instead that the wastes be diluted.
   _Fails to establish technology-based treatment standards for
eight toxic metals including lead, cadmium, chromium and mercury.
   _Allows toxic wastewater to continue to be placed in unlined and
leaking lagoons and some residues from the treatment process to be
placed in unlined landfills.
   ``This rule ... has every form of capitulation to every
pollution interest imaginable,'' said Fortuna, whose
Washington-based trade association represents high-technology firms
that specialize in the disposal of toxic wastes.
   Karen Florini, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund,
called the new standards ``extremely lax'' and said they fail ``to
meaningfully control wastes containing toxic metals.''
   Clay, the EPA assistant administrator, disagreed. ``The program
... will serve as a catalyst to prevent pollution by encouraging
all hazardous waste producers to find ways to minimize their
wastes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bonn Promises to Fight Anti-Semitism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bonn government, seeking to allay Jewish
fears over reunification, promised a gathering of world Jewish
leaders that it will maintain its vigilance in the fight against
anti-Semitism.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble addressed the final session
of the World Jewish Congress in Berlin on Tuesday evening.
   During the three-day meeting, delegates expressed concern over a
possible resurgence of anti-Semitism in Germany, which is still
grappling with the legacy of the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews
were killed by the Nazis.
   ``We will continue with all force the fight against right-wing
extremism and anti-Semitism,'' Interior Minister Wolgang Schaeuble
said in a speech.
   ``We do not hesitate to proceed with all means against those who
refuse to learn,'' Schaeuble emphasized. ``This was always so in
the 40 years of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). And
nothing will be changed in a united Germany.''
   The West German Interior Ministry supervises police functions
nationwide.
   There are about 35,000 Jews in West Germany, and about 2,000 in
East Germany.
   Jewish leaders have been alarmed by last year's strong showings
by the ultra-rightist Republicans in West Germany, although the
party has been losing steam lately.
   In East Germany, last year's peaceful revolution also gave rise
to some nationalistic sentiments. Young East German troublemakers
known as ``skinheads'' have been chanting extreme-rightist slogans.
   The Congress' president, Edgar M. Bronfman, has expressed
concerns over the growth of anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe,
especially in the Soviet Union. He also addressed the situation in
East Germany on Tuesday.
   ``In the Federal Republic (West Germany), there have been
programs of de-Nazification, programs to teach, programs to ensure
that what happened will not happen again,'' Bronfman said. ``For
over 40 years they have practiced democracy based on education.''
   Speaking to East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere,
Bronfman added: ``East Germany has a lot to catch up with.
Nevertheless, I know you will.''
   For more than four decades, Communist East German leaders
rejected any responsibility for the Nazi atrocities against the
Jews. Last month, the newly elected democratic government accepted
responsibility for the Holocaust.
   East Germany's first democratically elected Parliament on
Tuesday eulogized the millions who died at the hands of the Nazis.
   Recalling the horrors of the time, Parliament President Sabine
Bergmann-Pohl said ``the insane path of German history found its
end on May 8, 1945,'' the day World War II ended in Europe.
   Referring to last fall's peaceful revolution that brought down
East Germany's hard-line Communist leadership and opened the way
for reunification, Mrs. Bergmann-Pohl said: ``Today we have the
hope that May 8 does not remain as the last mutually binding date
for German history.''
   ``But it will always be closely tied to whatever happens along
our way into the future,'' she added.
   Heinz Galinski, head of the West German Jewish communities,
appealed especially to young people to resist the calls ``of the
new demagogues.'
   ``No one must forget that anti-Semitism belonged to that
ideology which pushed all of us to the brink of catastrophe and
plunged many of us over the brink,'' Galinski told the evening
session at the West Berlin Jewish Community center.
   Earlier Tuesday, Congress leaders went to the Wannsee Villa for
a solemn ceremony recalling the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis.
Nazi leaders plotted the extermination of the Jews at the Berlin
mansion.
   ``I will not pray here, because I personally believe that God
turned his face away from this place, as he did from Auschwitz,''
said Bronfman.
   Bronfman proposed the erection of a memorial at the crumbling
Berlin Wall to recall the importance of November 9: the day the
barrier was opened last year and the night of the 1938
Kristallnacht Nazi attacks on Jews.
   In Washington, two surveys released to Congress on Tuesday by
Jewish groups said anti-Semitism is on the rise in the Soviet Union
in the age of glasnost.

   The Phoenix Fiber Cookie that promises weight
loss and protection from cancer and other diseases is being removed
from store shelves under threat of court action by federal
regulators.
   Lawyers for Phoenix International Marketing Corp. of Sparks,
Nev., said after meeting with Food and Drug Administration
officials Tuesday that the cookie would be recalled and
distribution of related products halted.
   ``The company is cooperating fully with the FDA. It's pulling
back all the objectionable (promotional) material and they hope to
come out with a new product shortly,'' said David Weeda, a
Washington-based lawyer for the company.
   The FDA last Friday told the company to take the products off
the market because promotional materials for them made
unsubstantiated medical claims. The agency threatened to go to
court if the company did not comply.
   The material distributed about the Phoenix for Life Weight
Control Program claimed the products were useful in weight control
and in maintaining cardiovascular health, could prevent colon
cancer and could help people with diabetes forgo medication, the
agency said.
   The FDA also said the cookies contained twice the approximately
120 calories claimed on the label and disguised sugar content by
saying on the label that the cookies contained ``100 percent
natural cane juice.''
   The company plans to change the recipe for the cookie and draft
new labeling. If the new labeling is approved by the FDA, a new
product could be on the market within a month, Weeda said.
   Phoenix also is discontinuing temporarily other products in its
diet plan: Phoenix Fizzie, which dissolves in water to make a
lemon-flavored drink; Phoenix Nutritious Beverage; and Phoenix
Vitamins and Minerals Capsules.
   Whether these products will be reintroduced ``is up in the
air,'' Weeda said.
   Referring to the FDA's charges, another company attorney, Dennis
Johnson, said: ``We're not contesting FDA's conclusions.''
   The Phoenix Fiber cookie represents more than 90 percent of the
company's sales, which have soared this year _ from $2 million in
January, to $4 million in February and $10 million in March,
Johnson said.
   The cookie, introduced less than two years ago, contains large
amounts of fiber and comes in chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and
vanilla.
   As part of the Phoenix weight-control program limiting calories
to 1,200 to 1,500 per day, the company recommends eating a cookie
and drinking two glasses of water in place of a meal.
   The company has hired a nutritionist to review its diet plan and
suggest changes, Weeda said.

   Finance ministers from 152 nations are heading
home after stopping short of endorsing a $1.3 billion fund to help
Eastern European and Third World countries protect the environment.
   France supported the establishment of the ``Green Fund,'' but
the United States and other powerful members of the International
Monetary Fund and its sister organization, the World Bank, balked.
   Britain and Japan also opposed the new program, which was backed
by World Bank President Barber Conable.
   The World Bank already keeps environmental considerations in
mind when lending for development projects and it supports some
environmental projects in poor countries. But Conable argued that a
new program was needed to address pollution problems that spill
across borders.
   The proposal was debated into the evening Tuesday by the
22-member Development Committee, a joint body of the IMF and World
Bank that sets policy for the agencies' development lending.
   In a statement, the committee said ``further work was
necessary'' on the proposal and that, meantime, the World Bank
should ``take steps to reinforce its existing environmental
programs.''
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy had pleaded with other
countries to ``send a positive signal'' by approving the program
now. ``Time is passing,'' he said.
   Among the projects that would be eligible are those aimed at
protecting the ozone layer, promoting diversity of animal and plant
species, reducing emission of gases thought to cause global
warming, protecting multinational river systems and preventing
deforestation and the spread of deserts.
   The idea is that no matter how zealous industrialized countries
are in attacking those problems within their boundaries, the
problems will not improve unless underdeveloped nations also
participate.
   ``There is no doubt industrial countries are under the
obligation ... to avoid deterioration of the environment,''
Beregovoy said. ``... Developing countries must also mobilize, and
we must help them to do so.''
   The Green Fund as envisioned by Conable would be a pilot
project, lending $1.3 billion over for three years at low interest
rates.
   Much of the money would go to Third World nations, but Eastern
European countries that had neglected their environment under four
decades of communist rule would also be eligible.
   However, the United States, concerned about its budget deficit,
and other large contributors to the World Bank argued the agency
should work to strengthen its existing environmental programs.
   It should, for instance, play a greater role in promoting
debt-for-nature swaps in which a developing country agrees to
preserve its rain forest, for instance, in exchange for a reduction
in its debt burden, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said.
   Conable, a former Republican congressman from New York, had met
with White House chief of staff John Sununu to seek U.S. backing
for the Green Fund but was rebuffed. Brady, however, insisted that
the environment ``is an issue of great importance to the United
States.''
   The finance officials did agree on a plan to increase the
lending capacity of the IMF to $180 billion from $120 billion
currently.
   The fund's policy-making board, the Interim Committee, announced
its support of the record increase in contributions from IMF
members Tuesday morning. It must now be ratified by members over
the next nine to 18 months.
   At the insistence of the United States, the committee linked the
increase to a program to crack down on 11 poor nations who owe the
fund $4 billion.
   The countries will get loans from a special IMF account. If they
default on their obligations, however, they could lose their voting
rights and the gold they originally contributed to the IMF could be
sold.

<TEXT>
   Republican Chairman Lee Atwater, who is
recovering from treatment for a brain tumor, has been hospitalized
for a second time because of a blood clot in his leg, according to
his spokeswoman.
   Atwater, who was released from George Washington University
Medical Center on Saturday for treatment of a blood clot in his
left leg, returned on Tuesday for physical therapy, said Republican
National Committee spokeswoman Leslie Goodman.
   Examination indicated the problem may not have been cleared up,
and doctors decided to re-admit him for more medication for the
clot, she said.
   He probably will stay in the hospital about two days, she said.
   Atwater has taken radiation and chemotherapy for a dangerous
tumor on the right side of his brain. Doctors have said it is
common for patients in his condition to develop blood clots.
   ``No one is alarmed,'' Ms. Goodman said. ``It's not a big deal.''

<TEXT>
   Marta Istomin cited ``a considerable
philosophical difference'' with the new chairman of the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in announcing her
resignation as artistic director.
   In a letter Tuesday to James D. Wolfensohn, a New York
investment banker who took command of the Kennedy Center on March
23, Mrs. Istomin, the widow of cellist Pablo Casals, expressed
resentment at the chairman's recent criticism of the center's
programming under her stewardship for the last 10 years.
   In turn, she attacked Wolfensohn's plans for a series of
ambitious performing arts festivals as ``quickly expiring
fireworks'' with little effect on expanding the Kennedy Center's
audiences or raising the level of artistic taste.
   In a three-paragraph statement, Wolfensohn said ``I greatly
regret'' Mrs. Istomin's decision to resign. ``She has been a fine
artistic director and has done exemplary work for more than a
decade,'' he said.
   Mrs. Istomin, a Puerto Rican-born musician, was appointed
artistic director of the center in February 1980.
   ``My programs have been mainly focused on lasting values and
substance rather than short-term glitter,'' she wrote Wolfensohn on
April 13, when she first served notice she was resigning effective
May 31.
   To attract an estimated $15 million annually in private funds to
support the Kennedy Center's own programming, Wolfensohn has
announced plans for a Texas state performing arts festival in 1991,
a possible East European festival the same year and a ``Festival of
the Americas'' in 1992, on the 500th anniversary of Columbus'
discovery of America.
   In her letter Tuesday, Mrs. Istomin made clear she thought
Wolfensohn's festival plans were an attempt to ``catch the public's
fancy'' while trying to obtain new financial support for the center.
   Wolfensohn has asked Congress and the Bush administration to
provide $45 million in federal funds to pay off the Kennedy
Center's accumulated debts and to make long-neglected repairs.

<HEAD>Senate Task Force Makes Pitch for Baseball Expansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a Senate task force on baseball
expansion made a pitch to Commissioner Fay Vincent to add a
half-dozen teams by the year 2000, but he wasn't swinging.
   Vincent, instead, kept his heels dug in on the position that
Major League baseball must first evaluate the success of two new
National League franchises planned for no later than 1993 before
committing to four more.
   Meetings between baseball's top executive and senators seeking
to push new franchises for their states have become a semiannual
event on Capitol Hill, and once more lawmakers questioned
baseball's antitrust exemption.
   ``What I said, very precisely, was that the difference between
us ... is that I am unwilling to commit baseball to expand beyond
the two teams in the National League in the near term,'' Vincent
told reporters after Tuesday's meeting with lawmakers. ``I don't
say it will not happen. I think it is unlikely.''
   National League club owners are scheduled to announce that
circuit's long-awaited expansion plan during a meeting scheduled in
Cleveland on June 13-14. Vincent emphasized Tuesday that no cities
will be awarded franchises at that time, and that the owners will
merely state guidelines for interested bidders.
   Denver and Tampa Bay-St. Petersburg, Fla., are believed to be
major contenders for the two new National League franchises,
although several others, including Washington D.C., Buffalo and
Phoenix, have said they want franchises.

<HEAD>Little Hope Seen For MOVE Charges Stemming From 1985 Tragedy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Justice Department says it has
insufficient evidence to reopen the case of the bloody 1985
confrontation between Philadelphia police and the radical group
MOVE.
   Saturday is the last day that Philadelphia police officers or
city officials could be charged with civil rights violations in
connection with the tragedy.
   John Dunne, chief of the department's Civil Rights Division told
reporters Tuesday, ``The case will have my full attention for the
next 72 hours. I am hopeful that we will able to find any new
information.''
   Eleven people died, including five children, when police bombed
a fortified row house occupied by MOVE on May 13, 1985. A fire that
began when the bomb was dropped destroyed 61 homes.
   A Philadelphia grand jury and a federal investigation previously
have concluded that the evidence would not support indictments.
   A group of Philadelphia ministers, lawyers and community
activists is still hoping a federal grand jury could be presented
with evidence and issue indictments before the weekend.
   But after meeting with the group for an hour, Dunne said he
could offer no assurances.
   ``The federal statutes are very strict,'' Dunne said. ``There
must be hard evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that
a party or parties intended to deny people within our community
their civil rights which are protected by the federal law.''

   Americans can now order postage stamps by

   The U.S. Postal Service announced Tuesday that it has set up a
nationwide stamps-by-phone system, operating 24 hours every day.
   Customers can buy stamps using major credit cards by calling
1-800-782-6724, (1-800-STAMP-24).
   The agency tested the concept between 1987 and 1989. It has now
hired the Dallas-based firm, TMI Corp., to handle the operation.
   The system is expected to be most useful to small businesses,
but can also be important to the elderly, the handicapped, and
others for whom a trip to the post office can be difficult or
time-consuming.
   Stamps will be sold at face value plus a $3 service charge, per
order, and mailed to the buyer. They will be available in sheets of
50, rolls of 100 or 500 and booklets. The service also will sell
postal cards and stamped envelopes.

<HEAD>Israel Offers Documents to Prove Arms Not Destined for Colombia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Israel has offered documents in an effort to
prove that Israeli-made weapons that wound up in the hands of a
Colombian drug lord were sent to Antigua at that Caribbean nation's
request.
   The file of 14 documents was handed over Tuesday to a visiting
Antiguan delegation, and some were shown to foreign reporters by
Israeli officials.
   They included a certificate signed by Antigua's top defense
official, Vere Bird Jr., assuring Israel that the arms were for the
exclusive use of Antigua's security forces.
   In March 1989, Israel's Defense Ministry said 400 Galil assault
rifles and 100 mini-Uzi submachine guns were shipped to Antigua and
reached their destination. The Haaretz newspaper said the value of
the arms deal was about $220,000.
   Israeli officials say they don't know how the weapons ended up
on the ranch of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a leader of the Medellin
drug cartel who was killed in a shootout with Colombian police in
December. About 200 of the Galil assault rifles were confiscated in
a police raid on the ranch.
   Antiguan officials have been quoted as saying they neither
ordered nor received the arms.
   The Antiguan delegaton, headed by Patrick Lewis, an Antiguan
diplomat at the United Nations, arrived Monday night to investigate
the affair. He was accompanied by three U.S. lawyers. They met
Tuesday with Foreign Ministry officials, including the head of the
Latin American desk.
   ``Israel asked the Antiguan delegation how and why a promise
made to Israel ... was broken and how items of an arms deal
supplied to Antigua finally arrived in private hands in another
country,'' said Moti Amichai, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   He said the Antiguan delegation would also meet with other
Israelis involved in the deal, but did not give details.
   Lewis refused to comment on the documents.
   ``We were sent here to gather information and we really can't
make any comments or statements. We have to report to our
government,'' he said.
   At a briefing, reporters were shown three documents, each
written in English on what appeared to be official Antiguan
stationary bearing the nation's coat of arms.
   These included a letter dated May 16, 1985, and signed by
Antiguan Cabinet Secretary Lionel Stevens. The letter appointed a
Maurice Sarfati as special envoy of Antigua's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
   The other two documents officials showed to reporters included
an end-user certificate and authorization for Sarfati to broker the
arms deal.
   The end-user certificate was attached to a invoice for the
weapons and said: ``The below listed items ... will not be passed,
sold or given to any third party.''
   The two documents were signed Nov. 9, 1988, by Vere Bird Jr.,
who is security adviser to his father, Antiguan Prime Minister Vere
C. Bird, 81.
   The New York Times on Sunday said Sarfati, who owned a
debt-ridden produce business in Antigua, and Israeli army reserve
Lt. Col. Yair Klein directed the diversion of weapons to Colombia.
   Amichai said he could not confirm if Sarfati was an Israeli
citizen or had any links with Israel.
   The daily Maariv newspaper identified Sarfati as an Israeli
businessman who had received special envoy status from Antigua to
develop energy, tourism and commerce.
   Klein said he had been hired to run a training camp in Antigua
for Panamanian rebels opposed to then-dictator Manuel Noriega. He
said the weapons were apparently sent to the Panamanians after the
plans for the camp fell through and some of them ``somehow got to
Colombia.''
   Klein repeatedly denied any involvement in the diversion.
   Last year, Klein was accused of training hit squads for the
Medellin drug cartel in Colombia. Klein denied the allegations and
said he was training farmers in self defense.
   In Antigua, Bird Jr. denied any wrongdoing but stepped down from
his post until the matter is resolved.
   The three U.S. lawyers joining the Antiguan delegation are
Lawrence Barcella Jr., Edgar Seibert and Conan Lewis, a Foreign
Ministry official said.

   Poisonous vapor rose from the Pacific
where lava from the Kilauea Volcano ended its fiery crawl after
burying a town.
   The molten rock hit the sea near Harry K. Brown State Park on
Tuesday after destroying 139 houses and forcing the abandonment of
the town of Kalapana.
   The lava reaching the ocean had flowed slowly from the
Kupaianaha vent on the eastern side of the volcano, a distance of
about 8 miles.
   Officials were keeping watch on the steam clouds rising from the
sea, known as laze. Laze contains hydrochloric acid and other
hazardous chemicals, but so far trade winds are blowing the gas out
to sea, the weather service said.
   No lava has flowed from the Kupaianaha vent since Monday, but
geologists have said it could be just another in a series of pauses
in the flow this year.
   Each pause has been followed by a larger and more devastating
outpouring of molten rock. The vent has intermittently spewed lava
since 1983.
   Gov. John Waihee and his Cabinet met with Hawaii County
officials Tuesday to decide what kind of assistance to provide
people who have lost their homes. He said the state had not heard
yet whether federal disaster relief was forthcoming.
   ``Regardless of the federal government, we'll be stuck with
this,'' said Waihee. ``We have to decide what we will do to
mitigate these problems.''
   Harry Kim, administrator of Hawaii County Civil Defense, said no
amount of help would make the area habitable anytime soon.
   ``I don't see anyone having that kind of resources to make the
land productive again,'' Kim said. ``Not in their lifetime or my
lifetime or the next hundred years.''

   Public schools are failing to deal effectively
with emotionally disabled children, and at least two-thirds of all
such youngsters aren't getting any help at all, a
soon-to-be-published study says.
   Schools tend to emphasize silence and obedience over learning
and offer few opportunities for the emotionally handicapped to work
with other children or learn social skills, according to the study
by researchers at Bank Street College of Education in New York.
   Many other youngters are being mislabeled as emotionally
disabled simply because they are ``mad, bad, sad and can't add''
and have thus gotten on the nerves of their teachers, the study
found.
   Some 400,000 students, less than 1 percent of the school
population, have been identified as having behavior disorders by
school authorities. But studies estimate the true proportion is at
least three to five times higher.
   ``This suggests that at best somewhere between 10 and 30 percent
of children in need are identified,'' said the report.
   Youngsters with behavioral handicaps are entitled to special
education under federal law. But whether or not emotionally
handicapped children get special help from their schools depends as
much on available resources and local attitudes toward difficult
behavior as on students' needs, the report said.
   The report also found that only one out of three emotionally
disabled students functions at or above grade level, and 42 percent
drop out.
   The study, to be published later this month, was written by Jane
Knitzer, Zina Steinberg and Brahm Fleisch.
   It was based on questionnaires sent to state directors of
special education and mental health officials, visits to 26
programs in 13 states, a review of literature in the field and
interviews with parents and educators from 1987 to 1989.
   ``The report leaves me optimistic simply because such a report
finally exists,'' said William Schipper, executive director of the
National Association of State Directors of Special Education.
   ``This is a very tough group to educate, a high-cost group. But
the state of practice is well, well behind what the research tells
us,'' he said.
   The report singled out a few exemplary programs.
   Golden Lake Elementary in Circle Pine, Minn., sends special
educators into regular classrooms, allowing youngsters to stay with
normal peers.
   Central Park East School in Harlem and elementary schools in New
Haven, Conn., Benton Harbor, Mich., and Prince George's County,
Md., have begun reforms that help all students. Such schools tend
to shy from labeling youngsters ``handicapped.''
   States, for their part, need to reexamine policies, the report
said. In some states, for example, school districts are ``off the
hook'' financially if a student is referred to a state facility.

<HEAD>Study: Experimenting With Drugs Can Be Just a Part of Growing Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experimenting with drugs can be a sign of
normal adolescent development, says a new study that calls into
question the ``just say no'' appeal to shun drugs altogether.
   Adolescents who experiment with drugs tend to be better adjusted
than abstainers or abusers, according to the findings by
psychologists Jonathan Shedler and Jack Block of the University of
California, Berkeley.
   The researchers' conclusion that self-control may be more
critical than abstinence conflicts with the ``Just Say No''
anti-drug campaign. But some peers agreed Tuesday that casual drug
use does not always lead to addiction.
   ``This may be hard for some people to take, but the real issue
is knowing when to put the brakes on,'' said Dr. Shirley Feldman,
deputy director of Stanford University's Center for Study of
Family, Children and Youth.
   ``There's a whole big world out there and, psychologically
speaking, experimentation is healthy in most youths.''
   Shedler said the findings from the research, which tracked 101
San Francisco youths from age 3 to 18, ``absolutely do not mean
drug experimentation is something that is beneficial.''
   ``But it does mean that some limited drug experimentation may
not be catastrophic,'' he said. ``It could be a sign of trouble to
come or simply a sign of normal adolescent exploration.''
   The study, published in the May issue of American Psychologists,
found drug abuse is a symptom of deep-seated psychological problems
originating in early childhood and is worsened by indifferent
parenting.
   At age 18, those who used at least marijuana once a week were
alienated, lacking in ability to control their impulses and
distressed compared with experimenters, the study said. Abstainers
at that age were anxious, emotionally constricted and lacking in
social skills compared with experimenters, or teen-agers who used
marijuana or another illegal drug no more than once a month.
   Those same psychological and behavioral traits were reported
when the children were studied at ages 5, 7 and 11, according to
the continuing research. The study group is now age 23.
   Brian Flay, director of drug prevention research in the public
health department of the University of Illinois, said, ``The `Just
Say No' campaign has always been off the mark.''
   ``We can't stop kids from trying everything,'' Flay said. ``The
`Just Say No' campaign is extremely simplistic. It should be,
`Learn how to moderate your behavior. Learn how to resist the
pressure to go overboard.'''
   Some psychologists, including Shedler, contend a more effective
anti-drug effort would identify children who have traits that
signal possible drug problems later in life, and then counsel those
``at risk'' youths.
   ``Nobody can predict absolutely who's going to abuse drugs, but
we can talk about risk factors that are pretty good indicators,''
Shedler said.
   Among the factors identified by the study, the mothers of
frequent drug users and abstainers were ``perceived to be cold,
critical, pressuring and unresponsive to their children's needs,''
the researchers said.
   The study found no noteworthy findings involving fathers of
frequent drug users. But fathers of abstainers were ``relatively
unresponsive to their children's needs'' and were domineering.
   About two-thirds of the 18-year-olds in the study had tried
marijuana, which is consistent with national figures. Few got
involved with harder drugs, although those who did have ``great
problems,'' according to Shedler.
   Some researchers have credited anti-drug education with a
decline in illegal drug use among young people.
   A 1989 survey of college students found that 36.7 percent used
an illicit drug at least once during the previous year, compared
with 56.2 percent in 1980, when the survey began. Drug use among
high school seniors dropped from 65.6 percent in 1981 to 50.9
percent last year.
   ``This reduced demand is attributable largely to the important
changes occurring in the attitudes, beliefs and social norms among
our young people,'' said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan
social scientist who helped conduct the survey.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index slipped
slightly today after a five-day climb, and the dollar declined
against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 157.03 yen, down 1.02 yen from Tuesday's
close. It opened at 157.24 yen and ranged between 156.95 yen and
157.40 yen.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's weakness to its
overnight drop in New York, in part due to European currencies'
strength against the dollar, as well as results of the three-year
U.S. Treasury bond auction Tuesday in Washington.
   ``The predominant sentiment of the market today was watching
from the sidelines,'' said a trader with Daiichi Kangyo Bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another trader, at the Bank of Tokyo, said higher-than-expected
bidding in the U.S. Treasury bond auction made the dollar less
attractive to currency investors because it suggested U.S. interest
rates would not rise significantly.
   The Daiichi Kangyo Bank trader noted, however, that 10- and
30-year Treasury bonds were to be auctioned today and Thursday, and
``until we see the results, we can't really say where it (dollar)
is going, but I don't think the yen will get much stronger than it
is now.''
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 14.31-point gainer the previous day, fell 24.97 points,
or 0.08 percent, closing at 30,945.61.
   It was the index's first decline since April 26. In the five
trading days before today, the index rose 1,546 points, or 5.25
percent.
   Securities dealer attributed today's decline mainly to
profit-taking.
   ``After the Nikkei index surpassed the 31,000-point mark in
early morning trading, many investors turned to profit-taking,''
said a dealer with Nikko Securities, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The index rose for five consecutive days until yesterday, and
many thought it was about time to take a break,'' said another
dealer with a major Japanese brokerage, also requesting anonymity.
   ``But as far as the market environment is concerned, such as the
stronger yen and the performance of foreign stock exchanges
overnight, it looks like a bullish market is ahead of us. It seems
to have managed the heavy profit-taking today,'' he added.
   A dealer with Nomura Securities said the yen's rise triggered
sales of export-oriented issues, such as electricity and automobile
shares. The stronger yen generally depresses the profits of
export-dependent industries.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was quoted at 86.72 points at 4 p.m., up
from Tuesday's close at 86.46. The yield fell to 7.220 percent from
7.275 percent the previous day.

   Some people never throw anything
away, according to Scott Bruce, who came to this breakfast food
mecca looking for old cereal boxes to add to his collection.
   Sound flaky?
   ``Cereal boxes represent heroes of popular culture _ the grain
gods, I call them,'' said Bruce, a Cambridge, Mass., collector who
once started a lunch-box collecting craze.
   ``When a kid sits down with a bowl of his favorite cereal, he
becomes one with his hero. It's like a secular communion rite.''
   Bruce, 34, is talking this week with cereal company executives
as well as ordinary people who hoard cereal boxes, if there is such
a thing.
   Rare boxes can fetch up to $1,000, said Bruce, who began his
collection in 1988 and recently published a collector's magazine
called Flake.
   Battle Creek is the home of Kellogg Co., the world's largest
cereal maker, as well as Post and Ralston-Purina plants.
   ``The people here have cereal in their bloodstream,'' said Bruce.
   Old cereal boxes are all the more valuable because of the
scarcity of people who allow them to hang around.
   ``The militant mom was the death to many collections,'' he said
mournfully. ``But maybe I'll find that that odd citizen who has a
Corn Flakes box with Vanessa Williams.'' Miss Williams, Miss
America 1984, lost the crown when it was disclosed she had posed
nude for Playboy.
   Bruce said he generally hunts for vintage boxes in good
condition from the 1930s through 1970s. But he's even squirreling
away some of today's boxes.
   ``The 1990 Batman cereal box from Ralston is an instant
classic,'' he said. ``Just you wait.''

   Kent Floro makes the mussels into jewelry.
   ``Business has been going quite well,'' said Floro, owner of
Floro's Marina and a convenience store. ``It's kind of like your
pet rock from a few years ago. Everyone's got to have one.''
   Floro said he collects the basic raw material from the shore by
his marina. Completed mussel earrings, necklaces, tie clips and hat
pins cost between $3 and $4.
   ``We aren't going to run out of stock,'' Floro said, pointing
out that a mussel can produce 30,000 larvae a year.
   The tiny shellfish, less than an inch long, have been clogging
water intake lines from the lake since 1988.

<HEAD>Army Won't Seek Repayment of Scholarship Money From Gay Cadets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is dropping its bid to force repayment of
tuition from two cadets expelled from ROTC for homosexuality.
   A Navy spokesman Tuesday said the cases were ``reviewed on their
merits, and the decision was made not to seek recoupment,'' The New
York Times reported today.
   However, the unidentified spokesman said there had been no
change in the Pentagon's ban on homosexuals in military.
   Robert L. Bettiker, 22, a chemistry major at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and David Carney, a 23-year-old Harvard
graduate studying in Britain, had been dismissed after informing
their commanders they are gay.
   The Navy had said it would seek reimbursement of their
scholarship money: $38,612 from Bettiker and $50,687 from Carney.
   Bettiker on Tuesday called the turnaround great and said he
hoped it would have implications for other ROTC cadets in similar
circumstances.
   ``The way it's worded, they tried to make it as particular to me
as possible _ but I feel its a precedent,'' said Bettiker, who was
discharged Jan. 31.
   The Ohio native had planned to enter the Navy's prestigious
Nuclear Propulsion Program after graduation next month but will now
work in a cancer research laboratory at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   ``I always felt I did what was right,'' said Carney. ``I never
thought in the end they would sue for the money. The Navy is not as
mean-spirited as that.''
   In a third case, involving the expulsion of James Holobaugh, a
gay Army ROTC cadet at Washington University in St. Louis, an Army
officer has made a preliminary recommendation that the Army try to
recover it scholarship money.
   Holobaugh's case attracted the support of 24 members of Congress
for the ROTC cadets.
   ``We believe that to compel these men to repay this money would
not only be fundamentally unfair; it would also reflect an
appalling mean-spiritedness which has no place in the Navy,'' the
lawmakers said in a letter written by Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.

<HEAD>Hospital Reprimanded For Not Seeking Parental Consent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health has reprimanded
Children's Hospital for failing to seek parents' consent for a
comparison study of two treatments for infants with damaged lungs.
   The hospital ``made a serious error'' in not asking for consent
from the parents of babies chosen randomly to receive conventional
treatment, the federal agency said in a recent letter quoted in
today's The Boston Globe.
   Nineteen of the 20 babies who received the experimental
treatment survived, against six of 10 treated conventionally.
   The tests were part of a study that was published in December
and confirmed the value of the experimental treatment,
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, which ``breathes''
for the infants until their lungs can take over.
   Charles R. McCarthy, director of the NIH Office for Protection
from Research Risks, said the committee at Children's Hospital that
approves all human studies ``made decisions that rightfully belong
to the parents. ... They really blew it.''
   The action is believed to be the only time the federal office
has reprimanded a hospital for failing to ask consent of all
subjects in a study.
   Dr. Peter H. Wolff of Children's Hospital told the agency in a
letter that he would seek consent in all future human studies.
   But Wolff, chairman of the committee that approves human studies
at the hospital, defended the failure to seek consent, saying that
asking all parents for permission ``would impose unacceptable
psychological burdens on the parents of children not included in
the ECMO arm of the study.''
   Dr. Michael Epstein, who led the study, said that parents of
conventionally treated infants were not informed to spare them
anguish. He said that even if they decided not to allow their child
to participate, there was no way they could have obtained the
experimental treatment for their child _ at least not at Children's.
   ``I continue to be troubled by all of this discussion,'' he
said. ``But I still feel that we acted in a morally appropriate
way, given the conditions at the time.''
   At the time, the experimental treatment was available at many
other U.S. hospitals and some studies indicated it offered better
chances of survival to infants with severely damaged lungs.
However, no random, controlled study had proven its advantage or
documented its safety.
   Wolff's committee decided not to seek consent of all
participants to avoid difficulty recruiting subjects for the
conventional treatment, according to a letter from McCarthy's
office sent to the hospital in November.
   The hospital researchers have acknowledged in scientific reports
that a random study would probably show ``large differences in
survival'' between EMCO and the standard therapy.

   A German observatory known as Rosat
will be carried into orbit aboard a Delta rocket May 31 to study
the heavens for sources of cosmic X-rays.
   The $170 million satellite will perform the first full sky
survey of celestial bodies that emit X-rays, said Volker
Kaltenbach, Rosat spacecraft manager for the German Aerospace
Research Establishment of West Germany.
   It will use the largest imaging X-ray telescope ever built.
   ``Rosat is up to now the most ambitious project in the young
history of X-ray astronomy,'' Kaltenbach said Tuesday.
   About 1,000 sources of cosmic X-rays, which do not penetrate the
atmosphere and therefore are invisible from the ground, are known
to exist.
   Astronomers hope Rosat will identify 100,000 sources, said Alan
Bunner, Rosat program scientist for NASA. It will observe stars,
black holes and supernova remnants, hot clouds produced by
exploding stars at the end of their lives.
   The observatory originally was scheduled to be carried into
orbit by a space shuttle. But the 1986 Challenger explosion delayed
the mission along with everything else, and neither the German
Aerospace Research Establishment nor NASA wanted to wait until the
mid-1990s, Bunner said.
   Rosat was redesigned somewhat to be launched aboard McDonnell
Douglas' unmanned Delta 2 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station, Bunner said.
   The $170 million cost of the satellite excludes rocket and
launch expenses, which are being covered by NASA. The United States
has contributed about $106 million to the project. Great Britain
also has paid part of the costs.
   Rosat is short for Roentgen Satellite, named after German
scientist Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen, who discovered X-rays in 1895.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought is forcing part of the San
Francisco Bay area to ration water for the second time in three
years.
   Under the plan approved Tuesday by the city Public Utilities
Commission, the cost of water will jump, beginning in July, by
about 9 percent, increasing the average household bill to $6.28 a
month.
   Water customers will be given allotments based on the number of
people in a household. Those who use 10 percent above the allotment
will have their base rate doubled, while big water wasters may face
a tenfold rate increase.
   In addition, hosing down sidewalks is forbidden, decorative
water fountains will be shut off and restaurant customers will not
be given water unless they ask for it.
   ``There is a real emergency,'' said Rodel Rodis, commission
president.
   Officials aim to cut consumption to 25 percent of 1987 levels
for a total of 2.2 million people _ about a third of the Bay area
population _ in San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties
and Alameda County across the San Francisco Bay.
   It is the fourth straight year of drought in Northern
California; rationing also was ordered in 1988. Before that it was
last rationed in 1977.
   In March the Santa Clara Valley Water District, in the southern
part of the San Francisco Bay Area, ordered mandatory cuts of 20
percent to 25 percent.
   Some parched Southern California communities also are rationing
water.

he obscenely insulted an Asian-American reporter and phoned a radio
personality to joke about it on the air.
   The 61-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist was suspended
for two weeks without pay, Don Forst, editor of New York Newsday,
said early today.
   Breslin launched into a tirade in the newsroom Friday after
reporter Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh, 25, criticized his May 3 column as
sexist in an internal computer message. In an expletive-laced
outburst, Breslin referred to her as ``a yellow cur'' and
``slant-eyed.''
   Breslin was later reprimanded by his editors and apologized to
the staff in a computer message.
   Forst said the paper had believed the reprimand and apology were
sufficient until hearing Breslin's on-air conversation, which
indicated ``a lack of sensitivity to what what has been and
continues to be a painful episode.''
   The conversation took place Tuesday with Howard Stern, a WXRK-FM
personality who is known for racial and ethnic jokes and who
tangled with the Federal Communications Commission over his
sexually frank language.
   ``I have one social problem coming out of all of this,'' Breslin
said on the air, explaining that his nephew is to marry a Korean
woman in September.
   ``Now does this mean I can't go to the wedding?'' he said.
   Calls to Breslin at Newsday and at home were not immediately
returned.
   On Tuesday, a group of Newsday reporters, including Yuh, had
asked for Breslin's suspension or for the paper to print a column
about bias against Asian women. They had also threatened to
withhold their bylines on stories.
   After the meeting, Newsday editors listened to a tape of the
radio show and decided to discipline Breslin, New York Newsday
reported today.
   The suspension was applauded by a representative of one
Asian-American group.
   ``Basically, we are glad that management had decided to do the
right thing,'' said Jeannie Park, a board member of the Asian
American Journalists Association.

   At his inauguration as New York's first black
mayor, David Dinkins hailed the city as a ``gorgeous mosaic'' of
races, nationalities and sexual orientations. Five months later,
cracks in the mosaic are showing.
   A flurry of events threatens to turn the melting pot into a
bubbling cauldron.
   At City College, two professors preach racial supremacy: One for
whites, one for blacks. In Brooklyn, a black group boycotts Korean
grocers. A white newspaper columnist slurs a Korean-American
co-worker. A Columbia University soccer player gives a speech
attacking homosexuals and Jews.
   Voices of caution are being heard. After a black student
reported to police that she had been sexually assaulted by white
St. John's University students, black leaders came to the school to
say there appeared to be no racial dimension to the case.
   ``Racist fires are alight,'' The New York Times warned in an
editorial this week about the Brooklyn boycott of two Korean-run
grocery stores by blacks. The paper urged Dinkins to follow through
on his campaign promise of bringing people together.
   Dinkins on Tuesday defended his low-key approach to the racial
conflicts and said he was using ``tremendously delicate diplomacy''
to resolve the dispute over the groceries.
   Racial tension is a constant presence in varying degrees in New
York, where millions of people from around the world live and work.
In 1986, for example, young men in the largely white Howard Beach
neighborhood hounded a black man to his death, and blacks protested
for months.
   But the recent rash of high-profile incidents has raised
questions about whether racial and ethnic harmony has been strained
beyond normal limits.
   In the anti-Korean boycott, blacks led by self-proclaimed
``anti-white'' activist Sonny Carson berated and spat on those who
tried to shop at the stores, whose business has plummeted.
   Leaflets encouraged consumers to avoid patronizing ``people who
do not look like us.'' Carson, a convicted kidnapper, was dismissed
from the Dinkins campaign last year for inflammatory remarks about
Jews.
   ``There are people out there who want to foment race riots,''
said Richard Izzo, a lawyer representing the Koreans in a civil
rights suit against the protesters.
   The city has been more active in battling racial violence like
the August attack on Yusuf Hawkins, a black 16-year-old shot to
death while shopping for a used car in a mostly white Brooklyn
neighborhood.
   Two juries today were considering separately the fate of two
white men charged in the killing.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a black activist who has been pressing the
prosecution of the case, last week urged blacks to remain calm
regardless of the verdict. ``We do not want Yusuf Hawkins' name
tainted with senseless violence,'' he said.
   But in today's New York Post, Sharpton warned that anything less
than murder convictions would lead to violence.
   ``You are lighting a match to the end of a powder keg and
telling us to burn the town down,'' he said.
   ``We are not calling for mindless violence,'' Sharpton added.
``Don't blame me. As a social weatherman, I'm telling you that the
clouds of violence are over New York City.''
   Violence broke out last week when philosophy Professor Michael
Levin offered a talk in Brooklyn titled ``White Fear of Black Crime
is Morally and Epistemically Correct.'' Nine people were arrested
and six police officers injured in a scuffle prompted by the
lecture.
   Levin and Professor Leonard Jeffries Jr., who believes whites
are inferior to blacks, teach at City College, which is 39 percent
black, 28 percent Hispanic, 17 percent white and 16 percent Asian.
   At Columbia University, soccer player Chris Ziadie stunned an
athletic awards banquet by charging the administration there
catered to Jews and homosexuals at the expense of other students.
   Newsday announced today that it is suspending Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist Jimmy Breslin for two weeks without pay for
a newsroom outburst in which he used racial and sexual slurs
against a Korean-American reporter.
   Breslin has apologized to the reporter and the staff.
   As these incidents hang heavy over the city, the world of
fiction provides little relief. A movie crew has been in town
making the film version of Tom Wolfe's novel ``Bonfire of the
Vanities,'' sparking protests that the blacks and Hispanics of the
Bronx are being unfairly portrayed as criminals.
   In the newly released ``Q&amp;A,'' featuring Nick Nolte as a corrupt
Irish-American cop, the soundtrack is thick with racial epithets as
Nolte goes about wiping out blacks, Hispanics and homosexuals.

<HEAD>Abuses Continue in Turkey, Amnesty International Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after the government proposed new human
rights safeguards, widespread torture and other abuses continue
unabated in Turkey, according to a report released today by Amnesty
International.
   ``In early 1990, thousands of people remained imprisoned for
political reasons, including hundreds of prisoners of conscience
convicted for their non-violent political or religious
activities,'' the international human rights organization said.
   ``Among them are members of political organizations, trade
unions and Kurdish groups as well as journalists and religious
activists. The use of torture continues to be widespread and
systematic, in some cases resulting in death.''
   Turkey ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture in
1988, the report said.
   In September and November, the government announced proposals
governing length of detention, access to lawyers and protection for
prisoners of conscience. None of those proposals has been enacted.
   Under the government proposal, the maximum detention period
under police custody would be reduced from 15 days to 4-to-10 days,
though longer detention would be permitted under emergency
legislation.
   The government also proposed abolishing the death penalty for 13
categories of offenses, but not for murder and political offenses
that produce the most death sentences, the report said.
   ``While these draft amendments, if passed, would represent a
step in the right direction, they nevertheless would fall short of
international standards in important respects,'' Amnesty said.
   The report included testimony from several prisoners who said
they were tortured with beatings on the soles of their feet,
electric shocks, showers of ice cold water and hanging by their
arms.
   ``Torture is still routine even among those detained for only a
few days,'' Amnesty reported.
   The testimony of prisoners shows ``anyone is at risk from
torture in Turkey, particularly if held on political grounds,'' the
report said.
   ``Many prisoners sign confessions under torture which are then
used as evidence against them, in violation of international
standards,'' it said.

<HEAD>Martinez Blames Sponge, Still Supports Electric Chair</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A botched execution that caused flames
to shoot from the head of an inmate in an electric chair was caused
by a synthetic sponge, Gov. Bob Martinez said.
   The malfunction occurred because two maintenance workers had
substituted a synthetic sponge for the natural sponge that serves
as a conduit for electrical current applied to the prisoner's head,
Martinez said Tuesday. The synthetic sponge didn't work properly,
he said.
   Flames, smoke and sparks shot 3 to 6 inches above the head of
Jessie Tafero as authorities administered three 2,000-volt shocks
to the convicted cop-killer on Friday.
   The governor said the maintenance workers ``took it upon
themselves to replace what they thought to be a worn-out sponge,
and didn't realize there is a different chemical reaction by virtue
of substituting a synthetic sponge for a natural sponge.''
   A report from Corrections Secretary Richard Dugger said Tafero
died immediately. The attending physician's report indicated that
at the least, the condemned man was knocked unconscious by the jolt.
   ``There is no way to apply 2,000 volts directly to someone's
brain without killing them instantly,'' said Dugger, who has
witnessed 16 executions. ``They are never conscious of what
happens.''
   Dugger, in a report requested by the governor, said prison
officials had conducted a test using a household toaster that
confirmed the synthetic sponge caused the problem.
   ``Although the sponge was only in the toaster for ten seconds it
produced a large amount of smoke and reduced in size by
approximately two-thirds,'' the report said.
   Tafero's attorney, Mark Olive of Atlanta, and the Florida
Clearinghouse on Criminal Justice called the execution ``torture.''
Tom Horkan, executive director of the Florida Catholic Conference,
referred to it as a ``barbarous experience.''
   Martinez, whose support of the death penalty has been
highlighted in his re-election ads, said he opposed legislative
attempts to introduce lethal injection as another means of
execution in Florida.
   ``There have been injections where they've missed the vein,'' he
said. ``I'm not sure from time to time there isn't going to be
debate about some procedure ... but I think in carrying out a
difficult mission, it's been carried out appropriately.''
   Tafero was executed for the 1976 shooting deaths of Florida
Highway Patrol Trooper Phillip Black and visiting Canadian
constable Donald Irwin of Kitchener, Ontario.
   He was the 22nd person put to death in Florida since the 1976
U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume use of the
death penalty.

<HEAD>Two Killed, 30 Injured in Bombings Blamed On Sikh Separatists</HEAD>

   Suspected militant Sikh separatists blew
up two buses at a terminal in this Sikh holy city today with bombs
concealed in plastic baskets, killing at least four people and
injuring 41, police said.
   Senior police superintendent Sanjeev Gupta said the first blast
occurred on a Punjab state transport company bus that was about to
leave for the state capital of Chandigarh.
   Police said a man and a woman were killed instantly and two more
people died after being taken to the hospital. They said 26 people
were hurt.
   The bomb exploded as passengers were rushing out of the packed
bus, alerted by a police search party that noticed the bomb, Gupta
said.
   Five minutes later, the second bomb exploded in a bus a few
yards away, injuring 15 passengers, he said.
   Both buses caught fire and were gutted.
   Gupta said the casualties were lower in the second blast because
most passengers were evacuated from buses at the terminal after the
first explosion.
   ``If the alarm had not been raised before the blast, the
casualties would have been much higher,'' he said.
   Bus station superviser Dilip Singh said the police, acting on
intelligence reports, began searching for a bomb an hour before the
blasts.
   Ranjit Singh, the driver of another bus, said he was parking his
vehicle alongside the first bus when ``I heard a loud explosion and
saw metal pieces flying in the air.''
   Gupta said Sikh extremists were suspected to have planted the
bombs. He refused to elaborate.
   Thirteen of the injured were in critical condition, he said.
   The second bus was on its way to a Hindu shrine, 220 miles north
of Amritsar in Jammu-Kashmir state, and was packed with Hindu
pilgrims, he said.
   Amritsar, the site of Sikhdom's holiest shrine, the Golden
Temple, is also the stronghold of Sikh militants who have been
fighting since 1982 for a separate nation they propose to carve out
of Punjab.
   Elsewhere in Punjab, Sikh extremists killed six persons since
Tuesday night, United News of India news agency said. The killings
brought to 777, the number of people Sikh militants are alleged to
have killed this year alone.
   The northern state, India's only region where Sikhs are in a
slight majority, is a rich farming area bordering Pakistan.
   Sikhs who form 2 percent of India's 880 million people allege
cultural, political and economic discrimination by the Hindu
majority and the Hindu-dominated government.
   In their bloody quest for independence, Sikh militants are
alleged to have killed 767 people this year alone.

   About 500 Islamic fundamentalists were
detained briefly after police broke up a sit-down protest in a
street outside a courthouse, police and witnesses said today.
   The demonstration occurred Tuesday in front of Morocco's Appeals
Court to protest the conviction earlier this year of six
fundamentalists. Traffic was blocked for about two hours.
   Police intervened and took away most of the protesters in vans
for an identity check, but officials said all were released shortly
afterwards.
   The court is hearing the appeal of six members of Al Adel Wal
Ihsane (Justice and Charity), an outlawed fundamentalist group, who
have been sentenced to varying prison terms for involvement in an
illegal organization, publishing illegal newspapers, and disturbing
the public order.
   The court adjourned the hearing of the appeal to May 15.
   Arriving outside the court building, the protesters sat in the
street, began reciting verses from the Koran and demanded to be
admitted to the hearing. About 40 were allowed in, but officials
then said there was no more room.

<HEAD>Reformers Welcome Court Ruling To Make Coalition Pacts Public</HEAD>

   Champions of electoral reform claimed their
first victory today after Israel's Supreme court ordered political
parties to make full disclosure of any political deals they make to
form government coalitions.
   In a unanimous 25-page decision, a three-member panel of judges
ruled in favor of suits filed by four Israeli citizens against the
center-left Labor Party led by Shimon Peres and the rival
right-wing Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, as well as
other individual politicians.
   Chief Justice Meir Shamgar wrote that the disclosure should be
made in the Knesset, or Parliament, no later than the day the prime
minister-designate presents his new government for a vote of
confidence.
   ``Free opinion and public knowledge of what is occuring in the
system of government are an integral part of the democratic
system,'' he wrote. ``Public confidence cannot possibly be
maintained on the basis of things which are concealed.''
   The court said that hiding information is justified only when
state security, relations with foreign countries or vital public
interests are endangered.
   Uriel Reichman, a law professor who has been a reform leader,
hailed the ruling as step toward overhauling what he called the
``corrupt system'' of political horse-trading.
   ``A coalition agreement can't be signed any longer in sealed
rooms without the public knowing how national interests are decided
and taxpayers money is distributed,'' he said.
   Reichman said it would give new impetus to the reform campaign,
which started six weeks ago with an outburst of public anger over
secret deals that were made to lure politicians to cross party
lines and to win over small religious factions.
   ``This is a victory for the protest movement,'' said Shraga
Eliad, one of the four citizens who petitioned the court.
   The movement began with a small group of hunger strikers shortly
after the national unity government collapsed March 15. Tens of
thousands later joined public demonstrations and a half-million
signatures, about 10 percent of Israel's 4.7 million people, were
gathered.
   Shamir has been given a presidential mandate to try to form a
government coalition after Peres failed to put together a coalition
that would have excluded Likud.
   Amnon Rubenstein, head of the liberal Shinui (Change) party,
said disclosure of coalition agreements would ``heighten public
disgust'' with the existing system and put pressure on the large
parties.
   He said the test will come when Parliament takes up reform
proposals in the next few weeks, including bills for direct
election of the prime minister and for the election of 80 of the
120 members of Parliament by districts.
   Parliament candidates are currently selected by the parties and
run on a nationwide list.
   Rubenstein said ultra-Orthodox religious parties which hold the
balance of power between Labor and Likud were to blame for the lack
of change until now.
   ``The Orthodox parties exercise a stranglehold ... They veto
reform whenever it threatens their interests,'' he said.
   Both major political parties welcomed the decision even though
they were targets of the lawsuit.
   Yossi Brun, a spokesman for Likud, said the party had disclosed
its agreements with small parties, including the Torah Flag and
Torah Guardians religious factions.
   The Jerusalem Post said the agreement with Torah Flag pledged to
give the party an extra $48 million for education, aborption of new
immigrants and religious activities.
   ``It is inconceivable that we would go against the Supreme Court
decision. We are for the decision,'' he said.
   But he said the decision did not apply to intra-party agreements
and would not force Likud to make public its pact with Avraham
Sharir, a former tourism minister who was lured back after crossing
over to Labor briefly.
   Labor Party Secretary Micha Harish was quoted by the Jerusalem
Post as saying ``we will keep our promise'' to disclose details of
coalition pacts.

   U.S. Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV
breezed to a primary victory, while the governor's former wife, Dee
Caperton, lost a chance to become state treasurer.
   ``I've won folks, how about that!'' Rockefeller told about 50
supporters at his campaign headquarters Tuesday night.
   Rockefeller, heir to one of America's largest fortunes, had
198,759 votes, or 84 percent, with all precincts reporting. He was
followed by inventor Ken Thompson, with 21,961 votes, or 9 percent,
and conceptual artist Paul Nuchims, with 14,508 votes, or 6
percent, in a race that was never expected to be competitive.
   ``I don't think that people know that much about what I've been
doing,'' said Rockefeller, a Democrat seeking a second term. ``I
look at the campaign as a creative way to show what I've
accomplished.''
   The Republican Senate nominee is John Yoder, 39, a former aide
to retired Chief Justice Warren Burger. Yoder had no opposition.
   In the treasurer's race, former Treasurer Larrie Bailey defeated
Ms. Caperton, 47, a former legislator and the former wife of Gov.
Gaston Caperton. With all precincts reporting, Bailey had 89,627
votes, or 38 percent, to 74,950 votes, or 32 percent, for Ms.
Caperton.
   The rest of the votes in the Democratic primary were divided
among Marie Prezioso, a Charleston investment banker, and Eugene
Knotts, a county assessor.
   Ms. Caperton, a former Miss West Virginia and runner-up in the
Miss America pageant, spent more than $240,000 on her primary
campaign, nearly 40 times the $6,169 spent by Bailey.
   The lone GOP candidate for treasurer was Elvin F. Martin, a
certified public accountant.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa arrived
here today on the first stop of an 18-day European tour viewed by
his government as a major step toward ending decades of
international isolation.
   Buoyed by a breakthrough in black-white negotiations at home, de
Klerk plans to meet with presidents and prime ministers in nine
West European countries _ the most extensive trip by a South
African leader since the governing National Party took power in
1948.
   In his talks with European leaders, de Klerk is likely to urge
an easing of economic sanctions imposed on his country and to seek
support for his initiative to negotiate a political settlement with
the black majority.
   He is to confer Thursday with President Francois Mitterrand, who
shunned P.W. Botha _ de Klerk's predecessor _ when Botha came to
France to visit the graves of South African soldiers killed in the
two world wars.
   No senior French official was at Orly Airport to greet de Klerk,
who was met by a Foreign Ministry representative and a military
honor guard.
   De Klerk had no public events scheduled today but planned a news
conference Thursday evening after meetings with Mitterrand and
Premier Michel Rocard.
   De Klerk reportedly was to have lunch Thursday with prominent
business leaders from across France, South Africa's sixth largest
trading partner despite its observance of limited European
Community economic sanctions.
   Mitterrand decided to invite de Klerk after the South African
leader made moves toward reform in February, including the release
of jailed South African black leader Nelson Mandela and the
legalization of anti-apartheid groups.
   Last week, de Klerk and a delegation of African National
Congress officials led by Mandela agreed to work together to end
political violence and clear the way for formal negotiations on a
new, post-apartheid constitution that would end the 5 million white
minority's monopoly on power.
   ``It is wonderful to go to Europe with the knowledge that South
Africa is busy taking its rightful place in the international
community,'' de Klerk told reporters before his departure from
Johannesburg late Tuesday.
   En route, he conferred briefly with President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast during a refueling stop in
Abidjan, the capital of the West African country. No details were
available on their meeting.
   South Africa's state-run television quoted a senior government
source as saying the European trip represented ``a concerted effort
to pull South Africa from the morass the country has found itself
in.'' The report said, ``The visit is ... of the utmost importance
to South Africa.''
   After France, de Klerk will visit Belgium, Italy, West Germany,
Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Greece and Portugal.
   Among his hosts will be British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, King Juan Carlos of Spain and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   France's relations with South Africa have been marked by several
peculiarities.
   In the 1970s, French authorities incurred international
criticism for nurturing a major arms trade with South Africa,
including the sale of the Mirage fighter planes, the backbone of
South Africa's air force.
   Since Mitterrand became president in 1981, France has stayed in
step with other European Community members in imposing selective
sanctions but has never been a vocal advocate of escalating such
embargoes. In some Parisian liquor stores, South African wines are
displayed in windows alongside local vintages.
   Johnny Clegg, the white leader of a multiracial, anti-apartheid
South African rock 'n' roll group, is more of a superstar in France
than anywhere outside his home country. Yet the anti-apartheid
movement in France is less of a force than its counterparts in
Britain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia.

   Carl R. ``Spitz'' Channell, convicted in the
Iran-Contra affair for illegally raising money for the Nicaraguan
rebels, has died at the age of 44.
   Channell died Monday in a Washington hospital while being
treated for injuries suffered when he was hit March 15 by a car,
according to authorities. Associates said he suffered from cancer
and pneumonia.
   The conservative fund-raiser who also operated a public
relations firm became the first person to be convicted in the
Iran-Contra affair, when he pleaded guilty in April 1987 to a
charge of conspiring to defraud the government.
   Channell's agreement to cooperate with the investigation of
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh was the first break for
Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   Channell admitted that he illegally used his tax-exempt National
Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty to raise millions of
dollars in private donations to buy weapons for the Contras.
   He implicated Oliver L. North in the fund-raising effort and
testified at the former White House aide's trial last year.
   North was convicted of unrelated Iran-Contra crimes but was
acquitted of charges arising from his involvement in the
fund-raising effort.
   Channell also assisted prosecutors in the investigation of the
sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Former Rep. Dan Kuykendall, a friend of Channell, said the he
was struck by an automobile on March 15 near his Capitol Hill
office. Channell was thrown over the top of a parked car and landed
on the curb, according to his aunt, Eleanor McManus, who witnessed
the accident.
   District of Columbia police spokeswoman Shannon Cockett said the
driver of the car that hit Channell had lost control of his
vehicle. The driver, Donald Parker Jr., was cited for failure to
pay full and close attention, Cockett said.
   The accident will be referred to the U.S. attorney for further
investigation because it resulted in a fatality, she said.
   After the accident, police said Channell was taken to D.C.
General Hospital and later was transferred to George Washington
University Hospital.
   Terry Abdoo, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Channell died
on Monday.
   Both Kuykendall and Mrs. McManus said Channell was suffering
from lung cancer and pneumonia at the time of his death.
   Channell ``struggled and struggled'' to recover from massive
injuries that included several broken bones and a crushed pelvis,
said Kuykendall, now a lobbyist.
   Fighting cancer, from which his brother had died two years ago,
Channell ``was in tough shape,'' Kuykendall said. ``But until he
got hit, his spirit was remarkable.''
   Services for Channell will be held Saturday in Elkins, W.Va.,
followed by burial in Huttonsville, W.Va., said Mrs. McManus.

<HEAD>World War II Anniversary Turns into Anti-Independence March</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout with anti-independence rally in Latvia. No

   Five thousand people who oppose
secessionist movements in the Baltics turned a parade celebrating
Soviet victory in World War II into an anti-independence rally in
Latvia today.
   The rally was held in the shadow of Riga's towering monument to
the victory over Nazi Germany, and speakers addressing the crowd
denounced the Latvian parliament's declaration of independence on
Friday.
   ``We consider the declaration of independence a defeat for
everyone,'' said Lt. Gen. Oleg Zinchenko, head of the political
directorate of the Baltic Military Region, which includes Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia.
   Zinchenko said the military was calling on the Kremlin to
intervene more forcefully in the three Baltics republics. Many of
his listeners waved bright red banners and Latvian flags emblazoned
with the Soviet hammer and sickle.
   A similar military parade took place in the neighoring republic
of Lithuania, Radio Vilnius reported. It said there were no
confrontations between backers and opponents of Lithuania's March
11 declaration of independence.
   One resident of Vilnius, however, said that 200 young people
shouted, ``Occupiers Go Home!'' at war veterans as they marched
along Gediminas Avenue near a monument to Gen. Ivan Chernyakhovsky,
a Soviet hero of World War II.
   The young people tried to block the path of the marchers, who
were apparently Russians, but a cordon of paratroopers prevented
them, said Pranas Karlonas, a Lithuanian radio editor.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, appearing on state-run
TV in Moscow, complained about the attitude of the Baltic
republics, which were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, overrun
by German forces, then retaken by the Soviets. ``We were greeted
with flowers'' when the Red Army drove the Nazis from the Baltic
republics, said Yazov.
   When Latvia declared itself independence, it did not ask for an
immediate break with Moscow or suspend the Soviet Constitution.
Like Estonia, it has set an unspecified transition period for
secession.
   Latvians are waiting to see if the Kremlin will impose economic
sanctions and send troops to occupy some government buildings, as
it did to Lithuania after that republic's independence decree.
   Unlike in Lithuania, where the population is 80 percent ethnic
Lithuanian, ethnic Latvians are in a bare majority in the republic
of 2.6 million people. Ethnic Estonians make of 64 percent of the
1.5 million people in their state.
   In Riga, the Victory Day celebration began at midmorning with a
military parade overseen by the commander of the entire Baltic
Military District, Maj. Gen. Fyodor Kuzmin. In brief remarks to
hand-picked guests on the banks of the River Daugava, Kuzmin
denounced Baltic independence, saying: ``We must overcome
nationalist, separatist and anti-Soviet tendencies.''
   Ceremonial cannon fire boomed through the warm spring air,
signaling the beginning of a parade of troops, artillery and
armored vehicles on the 45th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi
Germany.
   Marchers included several hundred paratroopers in blue berets,
whose presence in Riga over the past several days has caused some
concern.
   Pavel Pedanov, a 76-year-old veteran watching the parade, said
recent political events in Latvia spoiled the holiday.
   He said he opposed independence because ``the people should be
all together.'' He lamented the denunciation by some Balts of the
Soviet occupation in 1940 because ``they don't appreciate what we
did.''
   Veterans and officers marched toward the downtown victory
monument, and were met on the way by about 5,000 residents who
formed a separate civilian demonstration celebrating Victory Day
and protesting secession.
   Most were speaking Russian, apparently members of the
non-Latvian minority.
   One protester held a sign that said: ``Secession is profitable
only for nationalist careerists and political adventurers.''
   Another read: ``We'll support any leader who will impose order
on the country and defend the ideals of socialism.''
   Latvian lawmaker Viktors Alksnins, urged the crowd to support a
signature drive demanding a republic-wide referendum on
independence.

<HEAD>Two NY Premieres and Fracci at Ballet Theater</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Ballet Theater dancers looked wonderful
on the second night of the company's season at the Metropolitan
Opera. The program was two New York premieres, a dazzling ``Black
Swan'' pas de deux and ``Lilac Garden'' starring Carla Fracci.
   The Italian ballerina returned to American Ballet Theater as a
guest to perform in an excerpt from ``Lilac Garden'' at Monday's
gala opening and the entire Antony Tudor ballet on Tuesday night.
   The entire ballet, to Chausson's ``Poeme,'' was as achingly
romantic as it is meant to be. The young bride-to-be, danced by
Miss Fracci with subtlety and gentle beauty, is stoical but
suffering because in love with a younger man. He was danced with
romantic yearning by Kevin McKenzie.
   Ross Stretton as the Man She Must Marry was stiff with his
bride-to-be but softer when he met An Episode in His Past in the
lilac garden. She, danced by Martine Van Hamel, seemed a strong
survivor but she was hurting, too.
   The evening began with ``Birthday Offering,'' which Frederick
Ashton choreographed for the 25th anniversary of the British Royal
Ballet. It gives important solos to seven ballerinas, showing each
one's strength. Ballet Theater added it to its repertory last
October in Houston.
   On Tuesday, the star ballerina was Susan Jaffe, partnered by
Stretton. The others were Cheryl Yeager, Amanda McKerrow, Julie
Kent, Leslie Browne, Alessandra Ferri and Christine Dunham. All
looked good.
   Fernando Bujones, back this season as a guest, having been
greatly missed, and Cynthia Harvey danced the ``Black Swan'' pas de
deux. Both were in the highest, exciting form. Toward the end of
the duet, Miss Harvey danced only 16 of the famous 32 fouettes,
whipped-leg turns. The audience murmured, fearing she had felt a
muscle tear, but she finished the duet flawlessly.
   The evening ended with the half-hour ``Brief Fling'' which Twyla
Tharp choreographed for the company. This eclectic, quite enjoyable
ballet had its premiere in February in San Francisco.
   In it, Cheryl Yeager and Julio Bocca, in Navy, do formal ballet
dancing to ``I'm a Little Teapot'' played on amplified piano.
Shelley Washington, loose-limbed as Miss Tharp was as a dancer,
looked like an urchin being tossed around by Jamie Bishton, Kevin
O'Day and Keith Roberts in mini-kilts. Claudia Alfieri, Isabella
Padovani, Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace wore red plaid.
   During the 10 sections of ``Brief Fling'' there also was a jig
and music which sounded like minimalism meeting a cement mixer. The
music was by Michel Colombier. Clever costumes were by Isaac
Mizrahi.
   Dennis Cleveland played the violin solo in ``Lilac Garden.'' The
orchestra sounded thin, as though too small for the requirements of
the music.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that
Israel would not release any Arab prisoners in return for Western
hostages unless Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon were also freed.
   Speaking for the first time about a possible prisoner-hostage
swap, Shamir said no progress had been made in efforts to secure
the release of three Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon in 1986.
   Asked about U.S. hints that Israel might free its Shiite
prisoners to facilitate the release of Western hostages, Shamir
said: ``I don't think that anybody will ask Israel to participate
in such an endeavor without having a possibility to release our own
prisoners and missing soldiers.''
   The three missing Israeli soldiers are believed held by
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group.
   Hezbollah is also believed to have links to the Shiite
extremists holding most of the 16 remaining Western hostages,
including six Americans.
   When asked whether any progress had been made concerning the
release of the Israeli soldiers, Shamir said: ``Unfortunately, not
yet.''
   He spoke to reporters during a tour of a high-tech factory in
Jerusalem.
   Israel's military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said no
contacts were under way concerning a three-way swap involving
Israel, the United States and the captors in Lebanon.
   Shomron said in an interview broadcast today on Israel radio
that there have been no practical proposals for a prisoner swap.
   He also said any deal that might materialize would have to
include the release of the the three Israeli soldiers held in
Lebanon.
   ``When there is a readiness on the other side to return
(Israeli) prisoners, we are prepared for an exchange. This (policy)
has not changed,'' Shomron said. ``Today, there is nothing
concrete, where someone is talking to us about exchanges.''
   Shomron was interviewed Tuesday night at a reunion of hostages
and soldiers from the 1976 Entebbe rescue mission. He noted that
Israel had the option of rescuing hostages with a military mission.
At the Entebbe Airport in Uganda, more than 100 passengers aboard
an Air France plane hijacked by Palestinians were saved by a daring
Israeli commando operation.
   ``In my opinion, the Israel Defense Forces can do it again even
today. The IDF has units today that can do it, maybe even better,
because they have better tools.''
   President Bush has indirectly appealed to Israel to free Shiites
as a goodwill gesture to encourage further releases of Western
hostages, including six Americans.
   Last month, thanks in part to Iran and Syria, Shiite militant
kidnappers in Lebanon released Americans Frank Herbert Reed and
Robert Polhill.
   Iranian officials have said the release of any more American
hostages likely hinges on Israel's willingness to free Moslem
prisoners, including Sheik Obeid, a Shiite cleric taken from his
home in southern Lebanon in 1989.
   About 30 Lebanese prisoners, including Shiite clergyman Sheik
Abul Karim Obeid, are held in Israel. The South Lebanon Army, the
Lebanese militia trained and supplied by Israel, has more than 300
mostly Shiite prisoners in a south Lebanon jail.
   In addition to the Shiites, Israel holds 9,986 Palestinians who
were detained during the Palestinian uprising against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, also interviewed at the
reunion Tuesday night, said Israel was prepared to use all its
``bargaining chips'' to win the release of its captives.
   He said Israel's abduction of Obeid from south Lebanon in July
was necessary to provide Israel with a bargaining chip for a
hostage swap.
   ``My policy has been that when you have a hostage situation,
soldiers or civilians, if there's a military option, you use it. If
not, then enter an exchange deal. For that you have to have the
cards,'' Rabin said.

<TEXT>
   Fierce shelling today by the forces of
rival Christian leaders Gen. Michel Aoun and Samir Geagea killed 20
people and wounded 41, police said.
   The barrages came after Aoun threatened to attack ships using
ports controlled by Geagea.
   On Tuesday night, 11 people died and 21 were wounded in fighting.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 972 killed and 2,564
wounded since the showdown for dominance of the Christian enclave
north of Beirut broke out Jan. 30.
   Tuesday's deaths included Brig. Gen. Francois Zein, commander of
the military academy in the Aoun-held Fayadiyeh suburb east of
Beirut. Zein, 47, was killed when his office at the academy was hit
in a barrage fired by Geagea's Lebanese Forces militiamen.
   Aoun's threat to attack ports controlled by Geagea was aimed at
cutting off supplies for Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   A communique issued by Aoun's headquarters warned ``local and
international maritime agencies'' against serving any port along
the 28-mile stretch of Mediterranean coast in the enclave.
   Geagea's headquarters said in a communique the warning was
``illegal because it was issued by an illegitimate side that
usurped power.'' The communique pledged ``severe response to any
attack on a civilian ship.''
   Smoke billowed from east Beirut's district of Ashrafiyeh,
Geagea's main stronghold, and the pinewoods of the Metn mountains,
where Aoun's troops are entrenched.
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across Beirut as radio
stations interrupted regular programming to report on the
developments and blare appeals from hospitals for blood donations
to cope with the influx of casualties.
   Geagea controls Beirut harbor and the ports of Jounieh and
Byblos north of the capital.
   Jounieh, 12{ miles from Beirut, is the terminal for a ferry and
a hydrofoil from Cyprus. These vessels are the Christians' only
outlet from their enclave, which is ringed on its land sides by
hostile Syrian troops and their Moslem militia allies.
   Aoun's 19,000-man army controls only a three-mile strip of the
Christian coast and he is not believed to have any working gunboats
left from the heavy fighting with Geagea's militia of 6,000
fighters and thousands of reservists.
   He has heavy artillery in the mountains overlooking Beirut and
the coast and has used it to fire on Geagea's flotilla of gunboats
and armed speedboats.
   But the guns are not radar-controlled and the police spokesman
noted: ``It will be extremely difficult for Aoun's gunners to hit
mobile targets, especially speedboats.''
   The communique said Aoun declared the coast between Christian
east Beirut and the Madfoun bridge in north Lebanon a military
operations zone.
   ``Sailing across it is banned to any vessel irrespective of its
type or cargo,'' the communique said.
   Geagea ordered his flotilla to blockade Aoun's only sea outlet
at Dbaye, north of Beirut, on April 23 in an effort to prevent the
general shipping in weapons and ammunition.
   President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Salim Hoss drove to the
Syrian capital, Damascus, for talks with President Hafez Assad on
ways of implementing a peace plan to end Lebanon's 15-year-old
Christian-Moslem civil war.
   Aoun has rejected the Arab League-brokered peace plan, endorsed
by Lebanon's Parliament in the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif in
October, because it does not guarantee the withdrawal of Syrian
forces from Lebanon.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in predominantly Moslem regions under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. Aoun calls them an occupying army.
   He also refuses to recognize Hrawi's election to implement the
peace plan.
   But Geagea has recognized Hrawi and cautiously accepted the
peace plan, which calls for an equal distribution of power between
Moslems and Christians.

   Next week's launch of Columbia with
a $100 million observatory could be delayed days or even weeks
because of a problem with the shuttle cooling system.
   ``We're trying to understand it and understand where we go from
here,'' William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program, said
Tuesday. ``We'll probably fool with it another day or so before we
make that decision.''
   Columbia had been due to lift off May 16 or May 17, but a valve
that controls the flow of coolant does not appear to be working
properly, NASA said.
   If the valve has to be changed, NASA would prefer replacing it
at the launch pad, where it's never been done before, said NASA
administrator Richard Truly.
   Bascom Murrah, a NASA official in charge of prelaunch
operations, estimated it would be a ``10-day to two-week hit'' to
make the repairs on the pad because the system would have to be
drained of coolant and cleaned.
   Rolling the shuttle back to its hangar to change the valve or
another part could take even longer, Truly said.
   During Columbia's nine- to 10-day flight, the four astronomers
in the seven-member crew will operate the Astro observatory, which
will probe sources of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.

   Vice President Dan Quayle hailed America's World
War II soldiers today as heroes who laid the groundwork for
European unity, but some veterans boycotted a ceremony because of
Quayle's military record.
   In remarks to about two dozen members of the American Legion of
Paris, the vice president praised Dwight D. Eisenhower's vision of
world peace.
   ``Eisenhower foresaw that the Europe that existed in his time
must change to reflect the fundamental principles that these heroes
fought for, principles that the United States and France have
shared for some 200 years,'' he said.
   But one of the legionnaires present said that several people in
his 750-member organization declined to attend the ceremony at the
American Embassy because they believed Quayle avoided combat duty
during the Vietnam War by joining the Indiana National Guard.
   ``That bothers some of the members,'' said a Vietnam veteran who
asked not to be identified. ``But he could have gone to Vietnam.
The Massachusetts National Guard was called up and they took heavy
casualties.''
   Roger Lamtgne, a decorated member of the 101st Army division
that parachuted into Normandy on D-Day, called his views on
Quayle's military record ``personal.''
   ``But I will say that I think a man owes at least one time in
his life to his country,'' said Lamtgne of Lewiston, Maine, who
wore an ``I Like Ike'' button above his Bronze Star and Purple
Heart earned during the D-Day landing.
   Quayle later met President Francois Mitterrand for talks to
follow up the April 19 summit in Key Largo, Fla., with President
Bush.
   ``Things are changing in Europe,'' Quayle said after the
45-minute meeting. ``They're changing on the positive side of the
ledger. President Mitterrand has a vision of where Europe should be
going. His views are not only listened to, but solicited.''
   The pair did not discuss the situation in Lithuania, but Quayle
praised a proposal by Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany that the breakaway Soviet republic suspend its declaration
of independence and negotiate terms of secession with Moscow.
   ``It was very positive contribution to a very delicate
situation,'' Quayle said. ``We hope and anticipate this matter will
be resolved without violence.''
   Mitterrand supports a new European framework for security
focusing on the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe. Foreign ministers from the conference meet in September to
prepare a summit in late 1990.
   The conference includes the United States, Canada and all
European nations except Albania.
   Quayle's swing through Rome, London and Paris marks his first
official trip to Europe since being elected in 1988. Its purpose
was to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Eisenhower's birth and
strengthen the Atlantic alliance as the Cold War barriers between
East and West break down.

   Ohio voters cast out Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens, his long career
shattered by his conviction on a sex offense, while North
Carolinians boosted a black Democrat's bid to challenge
conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
   ``Never argue with the voters,'' Lukens said finishing a distant
third in Tuesday's GOP primary, which he entered over the
objections of his party's leaders.
   The loss, following his conviction on charges of having sex with
a 16-year-old girl, apparently ended a congressional career that
spanned nearly 25 years.
   On the busiest day of primary elections so far this year, both
Helms and Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia coasted
to easy victories and turned their attention to the general
elections in November.
   In other races:
   _Ohio Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. picked up more
than 80 percent of his party's vote to claim the Democratic
nomination for governor. That sets up a November race against the
Republican nominee, former Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich.
   _West Virginia's former first lady, Dee Caperton, lost her shot
at joining the administration of her ex-husband, Gov. Gaston
Caperton, when she was beaten in the Democratic primary for state
treasurer.
   _The indicted mayor of Atlantic City, N.J., James Usry, clinched
a spot in a June 12 runoff by finishing second to a city councilman
in a seven-way non-partisan race.
   _Former Democratic Reps. Katie Hall of Indiana and Ken Hechler
of West Virginia lost comeback bids in their old districts. Ms.
Hall was beaten by Rep. Pete Visclosky, and Hechler lost to Rep.
Nick Joe Rahall Jr.
   _A 100-year-old eye doctor lost his race for Congress in North
Carolina but wouldn't admit it. ``I don't concede a damn thing,''
Harry Merritt Stenhouse said after being trounced by businessman
Don Davis.
   The big race in North Carolina was the contest to select a
Democratic opponent for Helms, the flamboyant conservative who sets
Democrats' nerves on edge.
   Helms had little trouble knocking off two GOP challengers,
businessman George Wimbish and salvage dealer L.C. Nixon, who could
manage only 8 percent of the vote each. With 99 percent of the
precincts in, Helms had 84 percent, or 155,101 votes.
   The top finisher in the Democratic primary was former Charlotte
Mayor Harvey Gantt, who is hoping to become the first black Senate
nominee in North Carolina in this century. But Gantt failed to win
the 40 percent needed to avoid a June 5 runoff, which second-place
finisher Michael Easley, the Brunswick County district attorney,
called for this morning.
   Thad Beyle, a political science professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said a runoff would be bad news for
Gantt.
   ``I think if you go on the basis of the political history of the
state, if a liberal or a minority doesn't win it in the first
primary, they'll lose it in the second primary,'' Beyle said.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Gantt had 257,485
votes, or 38 percent, to Easley's 205,972 votes, or 30 percent.
   They were trailed by John Ingram, a former state insurance
commissioner, with 118,018, or 17 percent, and R.P. ``Bo'' Thomas,
a former state senator, with 80,875 votes or 12 percent. Two other
candidates ran far behind.
   There was less suspense in Tuesday's other Senate contest, in
West Virginia, where Republican attorney John Yoder had no
opposition and Democrat Rockefeller had little more.
   With 89 percent of precincts reporting, Rockefeller had 176,341
votes, or 84 percent, to a combined 32,551 votes for his opponents,
inventor Ken Thompson and conceptual artist Paul Nuchims.
   ``I've won folks, how about that!'' Rockefeller told about 50
supporters at his campaign headquarters.
   There was no celebration for Lukens, who has served in Congress
or the Ohio state Senate since 1967. His career began to unravel
last year, when he was convicted of a misdemeanor for having sex
with a teen-ager. And although he refused Republican leaders'
advice to retire, voters decided it was time.
   According to final unofficial returns in western Ohio's 8th
District, state Rep. John Boehner won with 25,068 votes, or 49
percent, followed by former Rep. Thomas Kindness with 16,330 votes,
or 32 percent, and Lukens with 8,681 votes, or 17 percent. Mort
Meier, a bond underwriter, had 716 votes or 1 percent.
   Lukens said afterward that he has no immediate plans. ``I really
haven't thought beyond tomorrow,'' he said.

   The guided-missile destroyer USS Conyngham,
damaged by a fire so hot its decks were ``bubbling,'' docked today
at the Norfolk Naval Station as the Navy began investigating the
blaze that killed a crewman.
   Eighteen other sailors, including the No. 2 officer, were
injured in the worst shipboard fire since a string of accidents
prompted the Navy to suspend operations for a two-day safety check
in November. A second Navy man was killed in a separate accident on
Chesapeake Bay.
   Six of the sailors with less serious injuries accompanied the
ship back to port before going to the hospital, said Capt. Paul
Hanley, Atlantic Fleet spokesman. Twelve others had been flown from
the ship to hospitals.
   The Conyngham, with a large scorch mark on its right side just
above the water line, docked at 2:30 a.m., 21 hours after the fire
erupted during routine operations about 100 miles southeast of
Norfolk, said Lt. j.g. Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman.
   The commander of a ship that helped the Conyngham fight the
blaze said today it was ``a major league fire'' that could have
destroyed the warship.
   Capt. Joseph W. Perrotta Jr., skipper of the USS Normandy, said
when he approached the Conyngham, smoke was pouring out of the
ship's forward stack area and bridge. The Normandy provided
additional firefighting equipment and personnel to help the
Conyngham crew control the blaze.
   The Conyngham crew ``did a super job of putting out that fire,''
Perrotta said. The ship could have been lost if not for the gallant
effort of the crew.''
   About 200 family members and friends met the 383-member crew,
which disembarked as work crews from other vessels boarded the
Conyngham to clear the vessel's decks of water, Hanley said.
   Naval Investigative Service agents earlier were flown to the
ship to help preserve evidence, said Cmdr. Deborah Burnette, an
Atlantic Fleet spokeswoman.
   The fire aboard the 27-year-old ship started in the No. 1 boiler
room as the boiler was being fired up, and spread to the ship's
nerve center, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The fire spread to the combat information center spaces, which
caused the captain to evacuate the combat information center and
the bridge, temporarily leaving the ship without communications and
dead in the water,'' Fitzwater said.
   One of the injured was seaman James Choss, of Hammond Lake,
Ind., an electrician getting ready for bed after working most of
the night in the combat information center, his mother said.
   ``One of the other guys in the room was hit by a fireball that
singed his hair,'' said Elizabeth Choss. Her son described hallways
filled with smoke, holes burned in the floor, masks on firefighting
gear that melted onto the faces of his shipmates and ``decks that
were bubbling' in the intense heat, she said.
   ``It was just trashed _ those were his words,'' Mrs. Choss said.
   ``He said a fuel pump blew down in one of the boilers'' and
that's what started the fire, Mrs. Choss said. Choss and his
companions were unable to get out of their berth area right away
because they couldn't get the hatch open, she said.
   The main fire was put out about 8 a.m., about 2{ hours after it
started, but the crew continued to fight smaller fires until
shortly before noon, the Navy said. The extent of damage was not
immediately known.
   Killed was Lt. Algernon Pope Gordon Jr., 34, of Montgomery, Ala.
He was the ship's operations officer, in charge of collecting,
evaluating and disseminating tactical information.
   Three of the 12 sailors airlifted to hospitals were reported in
guarded condition, the rest in satisfactory condition, including
Lt. Cmdr. Martin Moody of Indian Head, Md., the ship's executive
officer.
   The ship started for home under its own power, but its captain,
Cmdr. William R. Williams, ordered the engines shut down as a
precaution after a fuel leak was discovered, Ms. Burnette said.
   Shortly after noon, the salvage ship USS Opportune took the
Conyngham under tow.
   In another accident Tuesday, a propeller broke apart and threw
debris onto the deck of a Navy hovercraft involved in a towing
exercise at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, killing a crewman. The
Navy identified the victim as Petty Officer 3rd Class Norbert
Thomas Hanke of Louisville, Ky. No age was immediately available.
   Last fall, the Navy ordered a two-day ``stand-down'' during
which ships and installations reviewed safety procedures.
   More than 100 Navy personnel were killed on duty during 1989,
including 47 who died in a gun turret explosion aboard the
battleship Iowa. From Oct. 11 to Nov. 22, 13 serious accidents
occurred, four on Nov. 14 alone.
   Since the stand-down fewer accidents have been reported, Navy
officials said, although no statistics immediately were available.
   The 437-foot ship was commissioned in 1963. A conventionally
powered warship, the Conyngham is armed with Harpoon anti-ship
missiles and Standard anti-aircraft missiles, torpedoes, depth
charges and two 5-inch guns.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said he ship was scheduled to be
decommissioned in 1991. He declined to say if it might be
decommissioned sooner because of the damage.
   In May 1987, the Conyngham helped put out the fire on the USS
Stark and tow it to port after it was hit by missiles from an Iraqi
jet in the Persian Gulf. Sixty Conyngham crew members were
decorated for valor for their actions.

   Voters sent U.S. Rep. Donald ``Buz''
Lukens into retirement one year after he was convicted of having
sex with a teen-age girl.
   Lukens, 59, who had served western Ohio nearly 25 years in the
Legislature and in Congress, finished a distant third Tuesday in
the four-way Republican primary after the party disowned him and
invited the voters to remove him.
   The GOP nominated state Rep. John Boehner, 40, of West Chester,
to run in November. He faces Democrat Gregory Jolivette, 38, former
mayor of Hamilton.
   ``Never argue with the voters,'' Lukens said as he walked along
Main Street after his loss. ``You always believe you can win, but
without money, you just can't make enough things happen. Name is
just not enough.''
   In Lukens' case, his name may have hurt him after his conviction
last May on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness
of a minor. A Columbus girl alleged the divorced congressman had
sex with her in 1988 when she was 16.
   Lukens was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $500 but is
free on bail while he appeals.
   ``I feel he deserved to lose after the kind of stunts he pulled.
He kind of set himself up to lose,'' one constituent, Eric Hayes,
said Tuesday night.
   ``His character and the vote kind of went hand-in-hand,'' said
Tim Jones.
   ``I think you get what you deserve,'' said Donna Craft.
   Elsewhere in Ohio, Cuyahoga County voters agreed to pay up to
half the $344 million cost of a new downtown sports complex where
the Cleveland Indians and Cleveland Cavaliers plan on moving in
1994. The ``Gateway'' proposal passed by 52 percent to 48 percent
Tuesday, putting an extra tax on cigarettes and alcohol to help pay
for an open-air baseball stadium and a basketball arena.
   Lukens was seeking his third consecutive two-year term and fifth
overall. He first was elected to Congress in 1966 and served two
terms before stepping aside to run unsuccessfully for governor in
1970. He was elected to the state Senate in 1971 and served there
until 1986, when he again won election to Congress.
   With all precincts reporting, Boehner had 25,068 votes, or 49
percent, to 16,330 votes, or 32 percent, for former U.S. Rep.
Thomas Kindness, who represented the district for 12 years until
1986. Lukens had 8,681 votes, or 17 percent, and Mort Meier, a bond
underwriter, had 716 votes, or 1 percent.
   Among the Democrats, Jolivette had 13,122 votes, or 52 percent.
Lawyer Harry Wilks had 9,012 votes, or 36 percent, and Ricky Lee
Mattox was third with 3,166 votes, or 13 percent.
   ``We can be proud to be Democrats today,'' Jolivette said. ``I'm
not sure if John Boehner can (hold) his head up high with the
distortions and negative campaigning he's made against Tom Kindness
during their campaign.''
   Boehner dismissed Jolivette's comment. ``He's just starting his
November campaign today,'' the GOP candidate said.

<HEAD>Man Sentenced to Six Months for Using Hummingbird as Necklace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It wasn't an albatross but a pet
hummingbird that landed a man in jail after police caught him
wearing the bird as a necklace.
   Ramon A. Ruiz, 26, of suburban North Hollywood, was sentenced to
six months in jail after pleading no contest Tuesday to cruelty to
animals and an unrelated probation violation in San Fernando
Municipal Court.
   In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped a charge of
willful injury to an animal.
   Ruiz was arrested April 6 after police officers saw him walking
in North Hollywood with the bird tied to an 18-inch pink string
around his neck. The bird died a few hours after Ruiz was taken
into custody.
   Ruiz's public defender, Dean Masserman, said Ruiz had clipped
the bird's wings so he could keep it as a pet.
   ``Sometimes he tied it around his neck. That was poor
judgment,'' Masserman said.
   Deputy City Attorney Norm Wegener said animal control officers
never determined what killed the hummingbird. It had lost
circulation in its legs where the string was tied, police reports
said.
   At the time of his arrest, Ruiz was on violation for spousal
battery and tampering with a vehicle.

   WEST VIRGINIA&equals;
   SENATE: Sen. Jay Rockefeller defeated two Democratic primary
opponents in his bid for a second six-year term. John Yoder was
unopposed for the GOP nomination.

nomination but faces a June 5 runoff with second place finisher
Southport District Attorney Mike Easley.
   CONGRESS: In the 3rd congressional district, 100-year-old Henry
Merritt Stenhouse lost the Republican nomination and the chance to
challenge incumbent Democrat Martin Lancaster to businessman Don
Davis.

<TEXT>
   About 10,000 gallons of gasoline leaked
from a punctured barge early today into a heavily industrialized
waterway between New York's Staten Island and New Jersey, the Coast
Guard said.
   The spill at the GATX terminal on the Arthur Kill, site of about
a half-dozen spills this year, was reported by workers on the
barge, which is owned by Victoria Transportation of Elizabeth, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Jodi Hoffmaster.
   Workers had been pumping unleaded gasoline onto the barge for
several hours before realizing there was a hole beneath the water
line, said George Lowman, a spokesman for Chicago-based GATX.
   Fire Chief Richard Greenberg said the hole was about 8 feet long.
   Hoffmaster said 10,000 gallons spilled. Lowman said company
officials believed between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons of fuel leaked
into the Arthur Kill, which connects to New York Harbor.
   The waterway was reopened after about five hours when most of
the gasoline had either evaporated or dispersed, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Howard Holmes.
   The barge was to remain at the GATX terminal until officials
could inspect it, Lowman said.

   About 15,000 students hurling rocks
and firebombs fought with riot police and set a U.S. government
building on fire today in the largest anti-government protests in
the capital since 1987.
   Violent protests demanding the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo also were staged in other cities.
   Police, who fired tear gas canisters in Seoul, said dozens of
officers and protesters were injured but gave no numbers. It
appeared no one was hurt in the fire at the U.S. building.
   The demonstrations came as the newly created Democratic Liberal
Party held its inaugural convention. The students claim the party,
created by merging three political groups, will lead to
dictatorship.
   Fierce street battles broke out in central Seoul as groups of
300 to 2,000 students dashed from sidewalks to occupy main streets
around the fashionable Shinsegye Department Store just before
sunset.
   About 2,000 riot police in the area were outnumbered by columns
of protesters surging down main boulevards leading to city hall and
other government offices.
   Angry demonstrators overpowered at least two groups of 200 to
300 riot police and seized their helmets, clubs and shields. Some
police were beaten up by protesters.
   About 3,000 students fought pitched battles with riot police
near the U.S. Information Service Center in downtown Seoul.
   During the two hours of fighting, students broke windows at the
center and threw firebombs inside the first floor, touching off a
fire that burned out of control for more than an hour.
   Firefighters extinguished the blaze after police regained
control of the street.
   ``Yankee go home!'' students shouted as they hurled rocks at the
four-story building, which houses a library and trade offices.
   ``No U.S. personnel were known to be inside the building,'' said
Jack Sears, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy. He said a Korean
cleaning crew might have been inside. No damage estimate was
available.
   Street battles also broke out in other parts of the capital as
students tried to break through lines of police blocking their
march into the city center.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' students shouted as they raced down
the streets, raising their clenched fists in the air.
   By nightfall, the demonstrators, many armed with wooden sticks
and rocks, took control of several commercial streets in the heart
of the capital. A huge plaza in front of City Hall was filled with
tear gas and covered with rocks and broken bottles.
   Observers said the protests were the largest and most serious
since nationwide anti-government demonstrations in 1987 forced
former President Chun Doo-hwan to carry out major democratic
political reforms. At that time, hundreds of thousands of Koreans
took to the streets daily for three weeks.
   Earlier in the day, police arrested nine students who tried to
march on the U.S. Embassy in central Seoul, shouting
anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans. Radicals claim U.S.
Ambassador Donald Gregg, a former CIA Seoul station chief, was
behind a plot by government conservatives to prolong their power
beyond 1993, when Roh's term ends.
   Roh took office in early 1988 after winning the country's first
direct presidential elections in 16 years.
   In the central city of Chongju, about 100 students set fire to a
police station, and in nearby Taejon students burned a police bus
with firebombs, the Yonhap news agency reported.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, an opposition stronghold, about
200 students wrote ``Let's destroy the DLP dictatorship'' in blood
on a huge placard during a campus rally, the agency said.
   Violent protests also were reported in Suwon, Taegu, Pusan,
Chunju, Cheju, Kongju and Mokpo.
   Radicals had said they would stage violent anti-government
protests in 17 cities, and the nation's 130,000 police were put on
increased alert.
   Radical students and dissidents oppose Roh's new governing
political party, which they say is ``dictatorial and undemocratic.''
   ``We can achieve nothing without national unity and harmony,''
Roh told about 8,000 cheering supporters who filled an Olympic
gymnasium in southern Seoul for the inauguration of the party.
   It was formed in a merger of Roh's old party with two moderate
opposition groups early this year. Roh was chosen as party
president during the convention.
   Roh said the three-party merger, an unprecedented alliance
between governing and opposition parties, will help stabilize the
country's politics, which he said had been marked by ``confusion
and confrontation.''

<TEXT>
   A man convicted in the racially
motivated shooting of a black youth has been sentenced to the
maximum of 14 years and eight months in state prison.
   Mark Shane Lashley, 29, was sentenced Tuesday by Superior Court
Judge John Shook, who convicted Shook in a non-jury trial last
month of second-degree attempted murder, a felony civil rights
charge and a misdemeanor civil rights count.
   Shook called the 1988 shooting in Playa del Rey an ``egregious
offense against society for which (Lashley) will be punished
severely with a maximum sentence, which is so justly and richly
deserved.''
   According to trial testimony, 14-year-old Terrence Goudeau and
three young cousins were fishing on June 26, 1988, when Lashley and
two friends shouted racial slurs at them.
   The boys yelled back and the argument escalated, ending when
Lashley aimed a .22-caliber rifle at Goudeau, who ran, shielding a
12-year-old cousin.
   Goudeau was shot in the back, and a bullet nicked a lung. Bullet
fragments remain embedded near his spine.
   Lashley's attorney, Lloyd Riley, who is black, called the prison
term unreasonably harsh and said there was ``too much emphasis on
the factor of race.''

<HEAD>American Legion Band Helps Celebrate Soviet Victory Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An American Legion band didn't get to march
through Red Square as planned, but the musicians did strut down
Marx Prospect today, drawing hugs, kisses and cheers from
Muscovites celebrating Victory Day.
   Bandleader Dorothy Hill, 74, brought the 70-member, all-male
band from American Legion Post 156 in Waltham, Mass., to the Soviet
Union on a mission of peace.
   Mrs. Hill said band members had originally been led to believe
from Soviet officials that they would be the first U.S. band to
play in the main Victory Day military parade through Red Square
celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany.
   But after the band arrived in Moscow, the Soviet Peace
Committee, which is organizing their visit, kept changing the
Americans' schedule and finally they were informed that they
wouldn't be able to march in the Red Square parade.
   No explanation was immediately available for the change in
schedule.
   Instead, the band had to settle for taking part in another
Victory Day parade in downtown Moscow of marching musical units
from various Soviet republics.
   And the Americans proved to be a crowd favorite.
   As the band marched down Gorky Street and turned onto
cordoned-off Marx Prospect playing ``God Bless America,'' traffic
police gave up trying to control the crowds thronging after the
Americans.
   During ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' one woman in the
crowd running beside the band shouted back ``Slava! Slava!''
(``Glory! Glory!''). Others gave the ``V'' for victory sign and
waved their fists in a salute.
   The band settled into seats in an open space next to the Bolshoi
Theater for a concert, and a crowd of about 1,000 pressed around it
so tightly that it had to be warned repeatedly to move back.
   Soviet war veterans wearing medals repeatedly hugged the
American Legion members wearing their military decorations.
   During a one-hour concert, the band played ``When the Saints Go
Marching In,'' ``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' and ``Old Gray Mare,''
during which Mrs. Hill twirled around jauntily to the music.
   As they played ``Hail Massachusetts,'' the band members put down
their instruments and sang the chorus: ``Swinging down the avenue,
with colors on high; We'll tell the whole creation that
Massachusetts passes by.''
   The crowd responded by improvising a chorus of ``Moscow Nights.''
   ``You see there is friendship and everybody is watching with
pleasure. That's why so many people are gathered here, thanks to
them,'' said Nikolai Sidorenko, a World War II paratrooper.
   After the concert, the band members laid a wreath at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier who fell in World War II.
   Summing up the trip, Mrs. Hill, a World War II Coast Guard
veteran, said it was ``far more than I ever expected to accomplish
on a first visit.''
   Richard Giovangelo, a band member from Newtonville, Mass.,
expressed some regret in not being able to march through Red Square.
   ``I wanted to. It was my impression that we were going to. Now
that we didn't, I'm somewhat disappointed,'' he said. ``But
overall, I'm satisfied.''
   The Joseph P. Hill American Legion Band, named after Mrs. Hill's
late husband, arrived in Moscow on Saturday on a 10-day trip. Its
members range in age from 17 to 82, and include veterans of World
War II, Korea and Vietnam.

<HEAD>Bush Offers to Halt Chemical Weapons Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, looking for an agreement to highlight his
upcoming summit, is offering to halt production of chemical weapons
if the Soviets set a schedule for destroying their poison gas
stockpiles, administration officials said today.
   With the visit of Mikhail S. Gorbachev less than two weeks away,
and other arms control negotiations running into snags, Bush would
like to conclude a chemical weapons agreement.
   However, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Soviets had to meet two conditions before the United
States would agree to stop turning out chemical weapons.
   The first, they said, is to agree to a schedule to destroy the
Soviet stockpiles. The other is to allow the United States to keep
a small arsenal until all nations capable of production agree to a
global accord.
   Initially, Bush last year offered to end production over eight
years. But now, the officials said, he is willing to set a date far
short of that if the Soviets meet the conditions.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will explore prospects
when he meets in Moscow next week with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   They are also to go over problems in other arms control fields.
The most difficult concern a proposed treaty to cut long-range
nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by up to 50 percent on
each side.
   Bush and Gorbachev had hoped to sign such a treaty at their May
30-June 3 summit here. But as the date draws close, many
differences remain. These include a Soviet demand to restrict
multi-warhead missiles carried on warships. The administration is
resisting this, and also insisting on retaining more air-launched
cruise missiles than the Soviets have proposed.
   A chemical weapons agreement at the summit would be historic and
serve the political purpse of distracting attention from slow
progress in other areas.
   The United States now has about 32,000 tons of poison gas. U.S.
officials consider the Soviet stockpile to be somewhat larger, even
though Moscow announced in 1987 that it had stopped production
while the Reagan administration declined to end the U.S. program to
produce binary weapons. This is a process of manufacturing two
ingredients which are deadly when mixed.
   Even if the Soviets agree to terms before or during the
Washington summit, officials said the accord would begin to take
effect some months later.
   The first accounts of Bush's chemical weapons initiative
appeared in Tuesday editions of The Washington Times.

   Former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt will face a
runoff with a district attorney in his bid to become the first
black nominated for the Senate from North Carolina this century.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, unofficial returns
showed Gantt leading Brunswick County District Attorney Mike Easley
by 38 percent to 30 percent. Gantt was just shy of the 40 percent
threshold needed for an outright nomination to face Republican
incumbent Jesse Helms in November.
   ``It's like kissing your sister at the last minute,'' Gantt said
as the final precincts were counted. ``We want to get the brass
ring and it's pretty close.''
   Four other candidates on the Democratic ballot split the
remaining 32 percent of the vote. In the Republican primary, Helms
easily defeated two opponents, drawing 84 percent of the vote.
   Gantt, who campaigned on the premise that a runoff would divide
the party, urged Easley late Tuesday not to let ``1 or 2 percent
divide us.''
   But Easley called for a runoff in a news conference this morning
at state Democratic Party Headquarters.
   ``We don't want to send our candidate into the fall armed with
less than 40 percent of the vote,'' Easley said.
   Easley said he informed Gantt this morning that he wanted a
runoff, which otherwise would not occur automatically under state
law. ``I don't think he expressed disappointment and I don't think
he expressed any surprise,'' he said.
   Gantt had no immediate comment on Easley's announcement.
   Thad Beyle, a political science professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said a runoff would be bad news for
Gantt, despite his first-place finish.
   ``I think if you go on the basis of the political history of the
state, if a liberal or a minority doesn't win it in the first
primary, they'll lose it in the second primary,'' Beyle said.
   In congressional races, 100-year-old Henry Merritt Stenhouse
finished last in a three-way race for the Republican nomination in
the 3rd District, but refused to concede before going to bed for
the night. Dunn businessman Don Davis took the nomination to face
incumbent Democrat Martin Lancaster in November.
   Other incumbent congressmen who won renomination were Democrats
David Price and Bill Hefner and Republican Cass Ballenger.

   The United States, which is trying to
persuade North Korea to negotiate with South Korea, has exchanged
letters with officials in North Korea's government, sources said
today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the North
sent a letter to Washington via the Soviet Union and Washington
responded. The United States does not have diplomatic relations
with North Korea.
   The contents were not made public, but Washington and Moscow
have been encouraging the reclusive, totalitarian North to work
toward detente with capitalist South Korea to ease tensions on the
divided peninsula.
   It was unclear whether this was the first such written
correspondence between Washington and North Korea's government in
Pyongyang.
   Despite the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe,
North Korea remains closed and is one of the last hard-line
Communist states.
   Word of the correspondence coincided with a three-day trip to
Seoul by the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Asian and
Pacific affairs, Richard Solomon. He met today with South Korean
Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong.
   Korean news reports said they discussed efforts to arrange talks
between the Koreas, divided since 1945.
   It was not known if the exchange of letters was discussed, but
one source close to the talks said, ``It would not be wrong to
assume it was.''
   American diplomats have met North Korean officials in Beijing
seven times over the past year, but U.S. officials have said there
has been little change in the North's attitude toward the South.
   North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to begin the Korean War,
which ended three years later with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
   The two nations remain technically at war, and the border
between them is the most heavily fortified in the world. The United
States has 43,000 troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   The Soviet Union is a long-time ally and arms provider of the
Communist North but in December established limited consular
relations with South Korea.

<HEAD>Maryland County Passes Mandatory Bicycle Helmet Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bicyclists would be required to wear
helmets under legislation passed by a Maryland county council, a
law one safety expert said would be watched nationwide.
   The legislation, which goes into effect 150 days after it is
signed by Howard County Executive Elizabeth Bobo, would be the
nation's toughest helmet law. Howard County, lies between Baltimore
and Washington, D.C., and has a population of 180,000.
   The County Council approved the legislation 3-2 Monday night.
Bobo has indicated she will sign the legislation within the next 10
days.
   New York and California have limited helmet laws for children
under 5.
   The legislation should create ``a ripple effect nationally,''
said Dr. Andrew Dannenberg of the Johns Hopkins Injury Prevention
Center.
   Andy Clarke of the Bicycle Federation of America, who had
expressed concerns about the legislation at a public hearing,
agreed that passage of the bill ``will have a national impact for
sure. Many jurisdictions will be watching to see if it works.''
   First-time violators would be subjected to fines of up to $50. A
second violation would carry a $100 fine if it occurred within 12
months of the first, but a judge could waive the fine if a cyclist
showed proof of having purchased a helmet.
   Dannenberg said he will lobby for similar legislation on a state
or national level.
   ``I will also try to get support for having helmets included in
the price of bicycles, to increase the accessibility of helmets,''
said Dannenberg, whose center will be monitoring the use of helmets
in the county under the legislation.
   The deaths of three youths in bicycle accidents in western
Howard County during the past three years prompted County
Councilman Charles C. Feaga to introduce the bill.
   Clarke's organization had expressed doubt about whether the law
would be accepted by the public. He had said a major bike-safety
education effort should be tried first.
   About 600 children die each year nationwide in bicycle
accidents, and head injuries are the most common cause of death,
said Fred Rivara, director of the Harbor View Injury Prevention
Center in Seattle.
   Rivara said a study by the Seattle center showed that helmets
would prevent 88 percent of the brain injuries suffered by cyclists.
   Helmets usually cost about $50, but Rivara said some
jurisdictions have gotten discounts from manufacturers that brought
the cost down to as low as $20.

   The Soviet Union proudly paraded its military
might through Red Square today, marking the 45th anniversary of the
defeat of Nazi Germany as Kremlin leaders grapple with the
reunification of their former foe.
   World War II veterans with red ribbons on their suits
accompanied some of the tanks and artillery they fought with from
Moscow to Berlin during the 30-minute march past President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and the rest of the Soviet leadership standing atop
Lenin's Mausoleum.
   The atmosphere was very different from the May 1 May Day parade,
when thousands of loudly critical protesters poured through Red
Square in front of Gorbachev, who walked off the tribunal with
other Soviet leaders.
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, who commanded a World War II
rifle regiment, today credited Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' with
lowering the tension in Europe, divided between East and West after
the war.
   ``At the same time, positive changes have not yet become
irreversible,'' he said in his orders for the parade. ``Military
danger still exists in the world.''
   The celebration of Victory Day comes as Eastern European
countries, freed by Gorbachev's reforms, are struggling to
re-establish democratic rule and rebuild their economies after four
decades of subservience to Moscow.
   Soviet leaders are also facing secessionist movements in
different republics, and these tensions were reflected during
Victory Day parades in the Baltic republics of Latvia and Lithuania.
   In Riga, the Latvian capital, 5,000 people who oppose the
secessionist movements in the Baltics turned the Victory Day parade
into rally against Latvia's declaration of independence on Friday.
   Lt. Gen Oleg Zinchenko, head of the political directorate of the
Baltic Military Region, which includes Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia, told the rally that the military wanted the Kremlin to
intervene in the three republics.
   Radio Vilnius reported there were no confrontations between
backers and opponents of Lithuania's March 11 declaration of
independence during a military parade through the Lithuanian
capital.
   But a Lithuanian radio editor said 200 young people shouted,
``Occupiers Go Home!'' at war veterans as they marched down a
Vilnius street, and paratroopers prevented the demonstrators from
blocking the path of the marchers.
   In the Moscow parade, the Soviets drove five new pieces of
military hardware through Red Square, including their latest tank,
a T-80 variant known to the West as the Soviet Medium Tank 1989,
for the year it entered service, said a NATO military officer who
attended the parade.
   Two new infantry vehicles were in the show, a BMD-2 airborne
combat vehicle equipped with an anti-tank missile, and a BMP-3
armored infantry vehicle with a double-barreled cannon, said the
NATO officer.
   One ominous-looking weapon was the new SAM-10 surface-to-air
missile, mounted on a long truck that carries four missile
canisters.
   The Soviets also displayed their BM-22 multiple rocket launcher,
a truck mounted with a brace of 220mm rockets with a range of about
24 miles, said the Western officer.
   The Soviet Union and World War II allies Britain, France and the
United States are negotiating with East and West Germany about
reunification. Moscow seeks a neutral Germany, but the United
States and its allies want a reunited Germany to be part of the
Western NATO alliance.
   In a speech Tuesday evening, Gorbachev reiterated that the
Soviet Union supports German reunification and wants to cooperate
with a new Germany. But the Soviet Union must be sure ``that in the
future, only peace will come from German soil,'' he said.
   Gorbachev also used the speech to sharply criticize Josef
Stalin's conduct of the war, and expressed hope that his summit
meeting in Washington with President Bush at month's end will lead
to further disarmament and an easing of world tensions.
   The Soviet leader smiled, waved and raised his clasped hands as
he led the leadership onto the reviewing stand for the second time
in eight days. Leaving the stand at the end of the parade, he
raised a bouquet of red and white flowers to the applause of the
diplomatic corps that gathered to watch.
   War veterans bedecked with rows of glistening medals marched in
columns between military bands, soldiers, sailors, paratroopers,
and KGB border guards.
   The motorized portion of the parade opened with the rumble and
smoke of two-dozen vintage T-34 tanks. The tank was first produced
in 1943 and helped push back the Nazis from deep inside Soviet
territory.
   Overall, the Soviets showed 18 pieces of modern equipment,
driving them through Red Square in formations ranging from six to
47 vehicles.
   An American Legion band from Waltham, Mass., had planned to
become the first U.S. band to take part in the parade through Red
Square.
   But the Soviet Peace Committee, which is organizing the band's
visit, kept changing their schedule after their arrival in Moscow
and finally informed the musicians that they would not be able to
march in the main Victory Day parade.
   Instead, the legionaires' band marched in another Victory Day
parade in downtown Moscow with marching units from Soviet republics
and gave a concert outside the Bolshoi Theater.
   No explanation was immediately available for the change in
schedule.

   Four people believed to be from a Rhode Island
sailing vessel were spotted in a life raft 150 miles southwest of
Bermuda early today, the Coast Guard reported.
   A search was begun late Tuesday after the Coast Guard station at
Woods Hole, Mass., received a report that the Misconduct, en route
to Bermuda, was sinking 150 miles north of Bermuda.
   A Navy plane failed to find the distressed vessel in that area,
the Coast Guard said. But a report from another vessel that had
been with the Misconduct several days earlier prompted the Coast
Guard to send a C-130 to search south of the island.
   The plane remained in the area awaiting arrival of a merchant
vessel, the Baron Trader, to pick up the four survivors.

   An attorney in the Bensonhurst attack trial said
his client was merely a ``jerk,'' not a murderer, but the
prosecutor said the man showed a ``depraved indifference to human
life'' by organizing an armed posse.
   A jury resumed deliberations about 10 a.m. today on whether
Keith Mondello, 19, a white, was responsible for the shooting death
of Yusuf Hawkins, a black 16-year-old on a Brooklyn street Aug. 23.
   At about the same time, a second jury resumed deliberations on
the case of Joseph Fama, 19, the alleged gunman in the Hawkins
killing.
   Judge Thaddeus Owens, who instructed the Mondello jury Tuesday
afternoon, has sequestered both panels.
   According to testimony, Mondello organized the mob to attack the
black and Hispanic friends that he had heard a neighborhood girl
planned to invite into the mostly white Bensonhurst neighborhood.
   Hawkins and three friends happened to wander into the
neighborhood to buy a used car. The mob surrounded them and
someone, allegedly Fama, shot Hawkins.
   Mondello and Fama would face 25 years to life in prison if
convicted of murder.
   Defense attorney Stephen Murphy said the incident was not
motivated by race and sought to deflect the blame to Gina
Feliciano, 18, who he said invited her ``drug-dealer'' friends to a
party in the neighborhood.
   Murphy argued that Mondello, who admitted to being on the scene
with a baseball bat, had nothing to do with the murder.
   ``As they were walking away, some lunatic comes out and shoots
him,'' Murphy said.
   ``You might convict him of being a jerk,'' Murphy said. ``He is
a jerk. He let her make a jerk out of him. He let the cops make a
jerk out of him. But it's no crime to be a jerk.''
   Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns countered that it was
preposterous for Mondello and the other young white men he had
assembled ``to believe they had the right to arm themselves and go
out on a public street'' to protect their neighborhood.
   After one of the whites pulled an automatic pistol and fired
four shots, the mob of about 30 young men scattered without pausing
to help their fatally wounded victim, Burns said.
   He charged that Mondello armed and set in motion the actions of
the mob.
   ``That's depraved indifference to human life,'' Burns said.
``He's responsible under the law.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today he
supports an emergency plan under which the government would spend
an additional $1 billion to absorb 150,000 Jews expected in the
coming year.
   The extra spending is necessary because the numbers of Soviets
arriving has outgrown the estimates of Israel's budget planners.
   The 1990 budget only earmarked enough funds to absorb 40,000
Soviet Jews during the fiscal year ending in March 1991.
   Updated figures suggest 150,000 may arrive in this period. More
than 30,000 Soviet Jews have come to Israel since Jan. 1.
   The plan to be presented to the Cabinet on Sunday estimates that
Israel needs $1.9 billion in fiscal 1990 to absorb the immigrants,
said Finance Ministry Spokesman Eli Yosef. He refused to give the
number of immigrants on which the ministry's calculations were
based.
   But former Deputy Finance Minister Yossi Beilin, who worked on
the emergency spending plan, said it was based on 150,000 Soviet
immigrants. Beilin left office, along with other ministers of the
center-left Labor Party, when the party's coalition with the
right-wing Likud bloc collapsed March 15.
   Asked whether his caretaker Cabinet would approve the plan
Sunday, Shamir said: ``I hope so. If we are convinced that this is
the program that is needed today in the period of big immigration,
we will approve it and make an effort to implement it.'' He was
speaking to reporters during a tour of a high-tech factory in
Jerusalem that specializes in employing Soviet scientists.
   The influx of Soviet Jews has stirred alarm in the Arab world,
where fears have been raised that the immigrants will be settled in
the occupied territories and displace Palestinians living there.
   Arab states have put pressure on the Soviet Union to restrict
the emigration, and as a result the Kremlin has not allowed direct
flights from Moscow to Israel. Instead, most Soviet Jews fly to
Israel via East European countries such as a Romania and Hungary.

<TEXT>
   Three Japanese balloonists trying to fly
over Mount Everest from Tibet to Nepal crash-landed today after
hitting a cliff in Tibet, and one was injured, expedition officials
said.
   The balloon and the basket holding the three men also caught
fire.
   It was the first attempt to cross the world's tallest mountain
by balloon.
   The balloon took off from Nyalam, situated at 14,432 feet on the
edge of the Tibetan plateau in southwestern China, said officials
at the Everest Japanese Balloon Expedition Committee headquarters
in Katmandu.
   Committee Secretary General Masashi Kakuda said that when the
balloon had traveled about six miles and reached an altitude of
about 32,000 feet, the balloonists decided to land as soon as
possible because the winds were not favorable for crossing the
29,028-foot Mount Everest.
   ``Then they went down. ... Unfortunately, their balloon hit a
tall rock and the balloon's envelope was torn. Later on, the basket
fell down several meters from the middle of the rock to the
bottom,'' Kakuda added.
   ``We didn't know what happened at that time. There was fire on
the basket and the balloon was half burned,'' he said.
   One of the pilots, Saburo Ichiyoshi, 43, of Tokyo, suffered leg
injuries in the crash-landing, Kakuda said. He said pilot Michio
Kanda, 41, and photographer Atsushi Saito, 27, escaped uninjured.
   Kanda walked about six miles from the crash-landing site to
Nyalam, Kakuda said.
   ``We have sent four rescue teams from Nyalam to help the
balloonists. One of the rescue teams met Kanda midway. As of this
evening, two of the rescue teams already had reached the
crash-landing site.''
   The expedition committee asked Chinese authorities for
permission to send two Nepalese helicopters to pick up the
balloonists on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Olive oil may be no better for the heart than
corn oil for people on low-fat diets a new study suggests.
   ``When someone is eating a reduced fat diet that's low in
saturated fats, it doesn't matter what kind of unsaturated fat they
choose,'' said Darlene M. Dreon, a research scientist at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.
   Previous research indicated that monounsaturated fats, found in
olive oil and peanut oil, beneficially lower LDL cholesterol,
so-called ``bad'' cholesterol, without lowering HDL, so-called
``good'' cholesterol.
   Polyunsaturates, such as in corn oil and safflower oil, also
lower ``bad'' cholesterol, but they tend to lower ``good''
cholesterol as an unwanted additional effect, previous research has
indicated.
   A 1985 study that prompted some consumers to switch from corn
oil to olive oil involved a highly enriched diet because the
experimenters hiked levels of unsaturated fats to measure them more
easily.
   In the new study, Dreon and colleagues found that neither
polyunsaturated nor monounsaturated fats offered an advantage in
maintaining levels of good cholesterol in the blood for people on
low-fat diets.
   HDL cholesterol is called good cholesterol because it is
believed to protect against heart disease; LDL cholesterol is
called bad cholesterol because it is believed to contribute to
fatty deposits in the arteries that promote heart disease.
   Excess total cholesterol in the blood is one of the three main
modifiable traits that scientists have linked to an increased risk
of developing heart disease. The other two are high blood pressure
and smoking.
   Researchers in the new study analyzed data on 20 women and 19
men who were all put on a standard diet for two weeks, then divided
into groups for 12-week diets alternately rich in monounsaturates
and in polyunsaturates.
   The standard diet was one recommended by the American Heart
Association, which calls for 30 percent of total calories from
fats, in contrast to the 40 percent of calories from fat that the
average American eats.
   The test diets provided the same proportion of calories from
fats overall, but restricted saturated fats _ the kind found in
meat and dairy products _ to 10 percent. The other 20 percent were
polyunsaturates or monounsaturates, depending on which test diet
was being used.
   Blood levels of LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol did not
change significantly with changing fat types, the researchers
reported in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Dr. Linda Cashin-Hemphill, an assistant professor at the
University of Southern California School of Medicine's
Atherosclerosis Institute in Los Angeles, said Americans should aim
for overall fat reduction.
   ``There is no one magic bullet'' for fatty substances, including
cholesterol, in the body, she said in a telephone interview. ``You
have to control total fat.''

   NASA engineers delayed until at least Friday
an attempt to snap the first photograph of stars using the main
camera of the Hubble Space Telescope, the space agency said today.
   NASA had said Tuesday that they would try to get the first
picture today, even if engineers had to interrupt the telescope's
shakedown tests, now entering the third week.
   But NASA spokesman Dave Garrett said today, ``The first light
picture will not be until at least Friday.''
   Garrett said he had no information about the reason for the
delay. Other public affairs officers more closely connected to the
Hubble program were not available.
   The first light picture is the traditional first photograph of
the stars taken by a new telescope.
   The plan would be to photograph a 3 billion-year-old star field
called Theta Carina, or ``The Ship's Keel,'' visible in the
southern sky. The star cluster, 1,260 light years away, can be seen
with the naked eye from parts of Africa, South America and
Australia.
   On Tuesday, ground controllers tried unsuccessfully to teach the
telescope exactly what in the heavens it is looking at. The
instrument was told to look for stars of a certain brightness in
what scientists thought was a rich field. It found none.
   ``It was somewhat of a surprise,'' said Michael Harrington, the
NASA manager in charge of the checkout. ``We had expected that this
field has a plenitude of that size stars and that we had no problem
getting plenty. It didn't turn out quite like that.''
   Once the telescope locks on to the bright stars, it will
remember where it was pointing and that, in turn, will enable it
later to find any other target ordered by the ground.
   The sequence is like looking at a map to determine your location
and then being able to go to any point from there.
   Harrington said there probably were gaps in the star field
without any stars of the brightness being sought. ``We thought we
had hit the field that was rich enough. It's not a problem with the
instrument.''
   The 12.5-ton telescope, which cost $1.5 billion, was released
from the space shuttle Discovery on April 25. Before Tuesday's
failed effort, engineers estimated they were one week behind
schedule in their checkout because of earlier problems.
   The telescope's mission is to collect the light generated by
galaxies and other heavenly bodies billions of years ago. It will
enable astronomers to look far deeper into the universe than
possible with ground-based telescopes.
   Teams of engineers are concentrating on two persistent problems
on the telescope. One is a jittery action when the instrument is
instructed to roll. The other is a shaking motion when the

   City welders have repaired the Little
Mermaid, the 74-year-old landmark in Copenhagen harbor which was
slashed by a vandal's hacksaw, police said Wednesday.
   The attempt to decapitate the girl-sized bronze statue may have
occurred several weeks ago, inspector Ole Wagner said. Police were
alerted Monday by an engineering student who found a deep gash in
the neck when he was studying earlier repairs.
   The municipality works department Tuesday welded the 7-inch
wound and covered the scar with patina, leaving a barely noticeable
discoloration.
   ``The old lady is doing fine,'' Wagner said in a telephone
interview.
   ``The crime probably occurred around Easter. Some witnesses
reported they saw someone on the statue on Good Friday,'' Wagner
said. Police were investigating but had no suspects.
   The original head was severed and disappeared in 1964. It was
replaced by a new one cast from the original mold. In 1984 vandals
amputated an arm, but it was found and rewelded.
   Built in tribute to Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen,
the statue depicts a girl with a fish tail looking wistfully to the
sea. It is taken from one of Andersen's best-loved tales.

<HEAD>Justice Department Refers Fauntroy Allegations to House Ethics
Committee.</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New throughout with Justice confirming referral to House
ethics panel.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said today it has
referred to the House ethics committee allegations that Walter
Fauntroy, Washington's non-voting congressional delegate, hired a
colleague's son for a no-show job.
   The department, which decided recently not to bring criminal
charges against Fauntroy following a lengthy investigation,
referred the matter for review by the House Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct.
   Although there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by
Fauntroy, ``there was information that the House ethics committee
might want to look at,'' said spokesman David Runkel, who declined
to give further details.
   Fauntroy, D-D.C., was the subject of a 15-month investigation by
the department into allegations that he had hired the son of Rep.
Gus Savage, D-Ill., for a no-show job.
   Thomas Savage was on Fauntroy's payroll from September 1987
through June 1988, except for an unpaid leave of absence, a period
when he said he went to Illinois to run for the legislature.
   Under House rules, congressional employees must work in
Washington or in the district the member represents.
   Runkel said a parallel investigation of Gus Savage had also been
closed for lack of evidence to warrant any prosecution, but the
matter also was referred to the House ethics committee.
   The Justice Department examined whether the elder Savage was
aware of any possible wrongdoing in Fauntroy's hiring of his son,
said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Washington Post today quoted unidentified sources as saying
the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section believed there
``were some things the ethics committee might want to look at'' in
the case of Savage's son.
   A spokesman for Fauntroy, Abbe Lowell, told the Post that
referral to the committee was routine in such cases, saying the
department ``has done no more and no less than follow their normal
practices.''
   Jan Keyes, a spokeswoman for the ethics panel, declined to
comment on whether it would open an investigation.
   Fauntroy is a candidate for mayor in this fall's election and
may not seek re-election to his House seat.

<HEAD>Pioneer Announces Satellite Navigation System for Vehicles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new car navigation system that uses satellites to
plot a vehicle's location and displays it to the driver on a
computer map will go on sale next month in Japan, a company said
Wednesday.
   The device is the first such system available on the retail
market, said Toru Yokomizo, spokesman for Pioneer Electronic Corp.
   The system, which goes on sale June 21, connects to a car's
audio system and uses special compact discs to display color maps
of any part of Japan, Yokomizo said.
   The AVIC-1 device uses signals from satellites to automatically
calculate the vehicle's location. It indicates the location with a
red dot on the maps, which are displayed on a four-inch flat color
screen, he said.
   The driver can choose from five levels of detail in the maps,
which also include names of thousands of restaurants, hotels, and
entertainment facilities and the services they provide, he said.
   The navigation system has an accuracy of 65 to 100 feet and can
be used by cars, trucks or even helicopters, Yokomizo said. The
vehicles can be moving or standing still.
   The complete system, including navigation device, display,
antenna and audio system, will cost about $3,160, he said.
   ``In the future, we hope to develop a navigation device that
will allow drivers to input where they want to go, and then will
display on a map the best way to get there,'' Yokomizo said. ``By
monitoring traffic reports, it will automatically advise the driver
to take an alternate route to avoid congested areas.''
   Such ``smart cars,'' which give drivers the latest traffic
information, also are to be tested in Florida and California.
   Pioneer has no plans to market the device outside Japan. It
estimates initial sales at 2,000 units per month, Yokomizo said.

   Italy agreed Wednesday to give Malta more

   Foreign Minister Guido De Marco and Claudio Vitalone, Italy's

   The agreement makes up the third financial protocol to a 1981
treaty in which Italy pledged to guarantee Malta's neutrality.
   Under terms of the agreement, the Maltese government said more
than half of the funds would go to make up for the island's heavy
trade deficit with Italy. It said the rest will be in the form of
loans and grants for infastructural projects and technical
assistance.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 3-4, Another former, with Polhill undergoing

<TEXT>
   Former hostage Frank Reed is expected to
remain hospitalized for another week but he is in good spirits,
sleeping well and starting to regain some of about 50 pounds he
lost, according to a medical report.
   The Air Force said Tuesday a battery of medical tests has tired
the 57-year-old educator so his examination schedule is being
spread out over more days. He went into the hospital at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland on Friday, four days after his Middle East
kidnappers released him April 30.
   Another former hostage and fellow educator, Robert Polhill,
underwent a biopsy Tuesday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center for a
growth on his left vocal cord.
   Jim Stueve, a hospital spokesman, said the findings were
expected in several days. Polhill, 55, was freed April 22.
   Reed's doctors had said he probably would be able to return to
his native Massachusetts by the end of this week, but that has been
revised to next week.
   The Air Force gave no further details on Reed's physical or
mental condition, citing his request for privacy. Spokesmen
referred reporters to a family friend, Carroll Lowenstein, who they
said was helping him deal with media requests for interviews.
Lowenstein did not answer his telephone Tuesday night.
   Reed told a news conference Sunday that his Islamic kidnappers
savagely beat him, breaking his nose, jaw, ribs and feet and
bloodying his kidneys during his 44 months in captivity.
   ``Thank God they didn't kill me,'' he said. ``I was one of their
pet whackers.''
   In the Middle East, Hussein Musawi, a Shiite Moslem
fundamentalist, said in an interview with the communist-run Voice
of the People radio that he did not expect the hostage issue to be
resolved this year.
   He said the United States has not responded with a goodwill
gesture of its own for the release of Reed and another former
hostage, Robert Polhill, within eight days of each other last month.
   Peggy Say, the sister of hostage Terry Anderson, has urged
Israel to release Shiite detainees to help win the freedom of the
remaining six American and 10 other Western hostages.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the hostages. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Mrs. Say made her request on behalf of the hostages at a meeting
with Ambassador Moshe Arad at his residence on April 27.
   ``We also have soldiers of ours that are in the hands of the
Hezbollah and we have other soldiers who are still missing in
action,'' Ruth Yaron, a spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy, said
Tuesday.
   ``Israel is willing to release those detainees that are held by
us for terrorist actions if this could bring about the release of
all Israeli prisoners as well as the release of the Western
hostages,'' she said.
   The embassy said the detainees held by Israel are terrorists,
not hostages.
   ``There is no room for any comparison between them and the
hostages who are innocent citizens kidnapped by the Hezbollah
organization and Lebanese organizations affiliated with it,'' the
embassy said.
   Syrian and Iranian officials have said the release of any more
American hostages likely hinges on Israel's willingness to free
Moslem prisoners, including Sheik Obeid, a Shiite cleric taken from
his home in southern Lebanon in 1989.

<HEAD>Collor de Mello Says Up to 400,000 Public Employees Could be Fired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de Mello said
today up to 400,000 public employees could be fired as part of his
economic reform program.
   ``The economic modernization of the country cannot proceed
without deep government reform,'' the president said after a
Cabinet meeting.
   He estimated that 1.6 million people work for the federal
government or for government-controlled firms.
   ``From now on, we will proceed with a reduction of 20 to 25
percent of this number, through firings and by placing excess
workers ``in availability,'' Collor said in Brasilia, the capital.
   ``In availability'' is a Brazilian legal term that means civil
servants stay at home and draw only partial salaries. The premise
is that eventually they will become disgusted and quit.
   Collor did not give further details of the layoffs.
   Previous presidents threatened deep cuts in the government
payroll, but never really followed through. It appears that Collor
was more determined than previous leaders, however.
   The 40-year-old leader also said today he will move ahead with
promises to privatize many of Brazil's 188 state-run firms, many of
which lose money and together have a debt of $62 billion. Many also
serve as job havens for friends and relatives of politicians and
appointees.
   ``The public sector will continue operating only in areas
considered to be of strategic importance for the economy,'' Collor
said.
   Collor was inaugurated March 15 for a four-year term after
becoming Brazil's first popularly elected president since 1960. He
campaigned on a pledge to reduce government waste.
   In his first day in office, he announced that 23 federal
companies, foundations, and institutes would be shut down, and that
more than 11,000 federal employees holding more than one government
job would have to quit their extra employment. He also froze $115
billion in savings accounts and money market deposits for 18 months.
   Collor has said those measures and spending cuts are necessary
to bring down record inflation of 4,854 percent during the past
year and eliminate a federal deficit of $31 billion.
   The actions have drastically cut the cost of living, but the
economy still appears headed for a recession.

<HEAD>Studies: Experimental Drug Relieves AIDS Symptoms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two new reports conclude that the experimental
drug DDI is a promising weapon against AIDS, but a top government
researcher cautions doctors and patients to ``suspend judgment''
until much larger studies are finished.
   The latest work found that the medicine improved AIDS patients'
blood counts, increased their energy and helped them put on weight.
But it also shows that the treatment can cause severe, even
life-threatening side effects.
   ``There is some evidence that it inhibits the AIDS virus,'' said
Dr. Howard A. Liebman of Boston City Hospital. ``The important
question is: Will the spectrum of toxicity prove to be the limiting
factor of the drug? Will that make it not any better than AZT and
perhaps worse?''
   Doctors hope that and other questions about DDI will be answered
by a major new study under way at hospitals across the United
States.
   The two newly published studies were conducted on small numbers
of patients by doctors at Boston City Hospital and the University
of Rochester. The results, published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine, were similar to those of a National Cancer
Institute preliminary study published last July in the journal
Science.
   All three studies were so-called Phase I trials. They were
intended to determine the maximum safe dose that patients can
tolerate, not whether the medicine had an effect on their illness.
Nevertheless, the researchers found that many of the patients
clearly improved while taking DDI for a few weeks.
   In an editorial in the New England Journal, the director of AIDS
work at the National Institutes of Health wrote that ``there
certainly is a suggestion of short-term benefit from DDI.''
   Currently, about 800 patients are enrolled in a study that
compares DDI to AZT, or zidovudine, the only AIDS medicine approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for routine use. An
additional 8,600 people who cannot take AZT because of side effects
or worsening symptoms are using DDI in an unusual program that
makes the drug available before its formal approval.
   In the editorial, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci predicted that the two
latest reports will stir up ``inevitable enthusiasm'' about the
treatment.
   But he added, ``Physicians and patients should suspend judgment
about DDI until the multi-center Phase II-III clinical trials
currently in progress are completed.''
   The New England Journal studies were directed by Drs. John S.
Lambert of Rochester and Timothy P. Cooley of Boston City and
involved 71 patients. Many of the patients felt better or put on
weight while taking DDI. Virus levels fell, while the blood cells
attack by the AIDS virus increased.
   However, high doses of the drug also caused inflammation of the
pancreas and severe foot pain.
   Liebman, who was senior author of the Boston City study, said
the potentially fatal pancreatic ailment often occurred after three
or four months of DDI treatment and frequently affected the sickest
patients.
   ``Physicians have to be very alert to the toxicities,'' he said.
``A lot of physicians are not sensitive to this. They are just
happy to be able to give something to their patients.''
   Even if DDI turns out to be no better than AZT, it still may be
an alternative drug for some patients. AZT often loses its
effectiveness after a year or so of treatment. It also suppresses
the body's ability to make new blood cells.
   Also in the journal, Dutch doctors reported an unsuccessful
attempt to prevent an accidental AIDS infection by giving AZT. The
victim, a patient in the hospital for an intestinal operation, was
mistakenly given an injection with a syringe that contained a small
amount of AIDS-tainted blood.
   Doctors quickly recognized their mistake and began giving him
AZT within 45 minutes. However, the drug failed to stop the virus,
and the man became infected.
   AZT is routinely recommended to prevent infections in hospital
workers who accidentally jab themselves with needles that have been
used on AIDS patients. The report, written by Dr. Joep M.A. Lange
and others from the University of Amsterdam, shows that the
strategy may not always work.

<HEAD>Recording Industry Unveils Parental Warning Label</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recording industry today unveiled a
uniform, voluntary parental warning label for albums that might
contain explicit lyrics.
   Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, told a news conference that the black-and-white label will
appear on the lower right-hand corner of possibly-objectionable
records, cassettes and compact discs reaching retail stores
starting in July.
   ``We believe the uniform logo will enhance the existing
voluntary system and better respond to the legitimate concerns of
parents,'' Berman said.
   ``Now that we have agreed on this new logo, it will be up to
parents to use it as they see fit,'' he said.
   The standard label, which reads ``Parental Advisory _ Explicit
Lyrics,'' will appear on albums at the discretion of record
companies and individual artists.
   Plans for the label were announced in late March at a convention
of the National Association of Recording Merchandisers, which
endorsed the idea at today's news conference.
   That association, representing record retailers and distributors
across the country, said, ``Our members hope that this voluntary
step by the recording industry will put the nightmare of
governmental regulation behind us.''
   Berman said that by his count, 16 of the 19 states considering
legislation requiring warning labels on records have backed away
from those efforts since the industry promised to institute a
uniform label on a voluntary basis.
   The voluntary labeling plan had previously been endorsed by
Tipper Gore, president of the Parents Music Resource Center, and
Ann Lynch, president of the National PTA, as a better answer to
parents' concerns about explicit lyrics than mandatory labeling.
   The new system is intended to alert consumers to recordings that
could be deemed objectionable because of explicit lyrics dealing
with sex, violence, suicide and substance abuse.
   The voluntary labels also were endorsed at the news conference
by Daddy O of the rap group Stetsasonic, who said he was the father
of five children.
   ``We don't think the government should determine what our
children listen to,'' Daddy O said. ``We all think the label is
cute.''
   Berman said he anticipated that virtually all of the recording
industry association's members would subscribe to the labeling plan.
   Record distributors which committed themselves to the new
labeling last month were Warner Bros., MCA, CBS, Capitol-EMI, RCA
and Polygram, the six largest recording industry companies.
   Companies belonging to Berman's trade association produce more
than 90 percent of the records sold in the United States. Many of
the records deemed objectionable by critics are released by small,
independent companies that are not association members.
   The uniform label replaces a system under a 1985 agreement that
involves individual record company warning labels. Erratic
compliance under that agreement created confusion among parents'
groups.

   Shafer, 46, a Walton postmaster, wasn't around to congratulate
her brother.
   ``She wasn't there. I haven't seen her today,'' Moore said.
   Moore, 42, an accountant, said he just wanted to serve on the
board, not challenge his sister.
   ``I was the first one to file from this district and that was my
goal,'' he said. ``It wasn't to beat an opponent no matter who the

   Moore will begin his term on July 1.
   Both candidates were Republicans and making their first bid for

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for three futures traders accused of
fraud will be allowed to introduce at their trial evidence
suggesting that the difference between legal and illegal trading is
``blurry.''
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams was a victory
for defendants Robert D. Mosky, Danny L. Scheck and David Zatz.
   Jury selection, which began Tuesday, resumed today for the
trial, which is expected to last six weeks.
   Mosky, Scheck and Zatz traded Swiss franc futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. They were indicted last year, along with 44
other Chicago futures traders and a clerk, on charges of defrauding
customers.
   Sixteen of those indicted have pleaded guilty to reduced charges
in return for their cooperation.
   Mosky, Scheck and Zatz face more than a dozen counts each of
fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. Each count
carries up to five years in prison and a $150,000 fine.
   Mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy, for which he
could be sent to prison for 20 years and be forced to forfeit
assets, including his exchange membership.
   The judge, ruling on several motions Monday and Tuesday, said
that if the evidence shows the line between legal and illegal
trades is ``sufficiently blurry,'' it can be introduced.
   Defense lawyers have indicated they will challenge the ability
of the prosecution witnesses to discern legal and illegal trading.
   The government's case hinges on the testimony of two traders and
on the observations and tape-recordings of an FBI agent who posed
as a corrupt trader.
   Swiss franc futures are contracts to buy or sell specified
amounts of the currency on future dates at prices agreed upon in
advance.

<HEAD>Postmaster General Says Mail Changes Inevitable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may make some people uncomfortable, but
change is necessary and is coming at the post office, Postmaster
General Anthony Frank said Wednesday.
   ``We have to have the foresight and the courage to take
responsibility for our future,'' Frank told a Senate post office
and governmental affairs subcommittee.
   ``It is not going to be placid waters, smooth sailing, and
huzzahs all around,'' said Frank, who was not specific about
changes.
   The postal waters have been decidedly choppy in recent weeks,
following reports of some planned reductions in service standards
at the same time the agency is seeking a rate increase.
   Higher postal prices _ including a 30-cent first class stamp _
are expected to take effect next year.
   Frank told the subcommittee, however, that postal costs have
been held below inflation for the first half of the current fiscal
year and work efficiency in the organization has increased for
three consecutive quarters.
   Mail volume and delivery points have increased slightly over the
last year, but the postal service now has 19,000 fewer career
employees than a year ago, said Frank.
   At the same time, he said, the agency is $361 million in the
black for this fiscal year, although it is expected to fall into
the red as the normal summer and fall decline in mail volume occurs.
   Frank noted the Postal Service will begin negotiating new
contracts this summer with its major unions and said changes in the
way workers are used may be discussed. He did not get into
specifics, however.
   Increased automation will also have a great impact on the
future, especially the use of bar codes on virtually all mail. Bar
codes resemble the rows of lines used for computerized supermarket
pricing and will allow mail to be handled more easily by machines.

<HEAD>Trial Resumes After Imelda Marcos Returns to Court</HEAD>

   Imelda Marcos, whose fraud trial was abruptly
recessed when she fell ill for a second time during emotion-charged
testimony, returned to court today wearing a blood-pressure monitor.
   ``She's feeling better today,'' her attorney, Gerry Spence, said
after the morning testimony.
   The federal court proceeding was halted in mid-afternoon Tuesday
when the former Philippine first lady, evidently upset by
references to her children, suffered an attack of high blood
pressure.
   Mrs. Marcos faltered and began to sob at the defense table and
was comforted by a niece.
   She was treated by a courthouse nurse and, still sobbing, walked
from the nurse's office to her black van with the help of a
courthouse marshal.
   Friends quoted Mrs. Marcos' personal physician, Dr. Rafael
Zagala, as saying her blood pressure had soared to 200 over 110, a
dangerous level.
   It was the second time in less than two weeks that Judge John F.
Keenan called a hasty recess after Mrs. Marcos, 60, became ill in
court. The first time, on April 26, the jury was not in the
courtroom, but this time jurors saw the incident.
   Her earlier illness prompted doctors to fit her with an
electronic device to constantly monitor her blood pressure. She has
worn it some days but did not have it on Tuesday.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of helping her husband, the late
President Ferdinand E. Marcos, loot their nation's treasury of more
than $220 million dollars, using the money to support lavish living
and to secretly buy four New York office buildings.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi, is
charged with having helped the Marcoses conceal their ownership of
the buildings and some artworks.
   Mrs. Marcos became upset as Spence cross-examined FBI agent
James Trimbach on whether he saw anything wrong with the Marcoses'
financing of the education of their daughters, Imee and Irene, and
son Ferdinand Jr., known as ``Bong Bong.''
   Before the witness could reply, Mrs. Marcos began to cry.
Friends said later she was upset by the reference to Imee, whom she
has not seen in four years. Imee, who has three children of her
own, lives in Morocco and is not permitted to travel on a
Philippine passport, they said.

   Comedians Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg
appeared before a Senate panel Wednesday to urge passage of a bill
providing long-term help for homeless families.
   ``It's a very sad state of affairs when we cannot take care of
our own,'' Goldberg said.
   Both appeared before the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee and are working with the Comic Relief group, which has
raised money for the homeless.
   ``George, read my lips: Help us,'' Williams said, referring to
President Bush, at a news conference before addressing the
committee.
   The celebrities support a bill sponsored by committee chairman
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and others that would authorize
$265 million next year for services for homeless people.
   Appearing with Williams and Goldberg was a formerly homeless
woman, Connie Perez of Oxnard, Calif., now a case worker helping
other homeless people. She described the hardship of trying to keep
her seven children together during three years of homelessness.
   ``My children suffered the most,'' she said. ``I am still trying
to correct the damage that was done.''

   Mary Martin and Celeste Holm are among
nearly two dozen stars marking the Shubert theater's 75th birthday
Saturday by reprising or reminiscing about its Broadway shows that
``opened out of town.''
   Miss Martin is expected to sing Cole Porter's ``My Heart Belongs
to Daddy,'' from ``Leave It To Me,'' which premiered at the Shubert
in 1938. Her tryout for the show was her first time on stage.
   Miss Martin also appeared at the Shubert in the pre-Broadway
tryouts of ``South Pacific,'' in 1949, and ``The Sound of Music,''
in 1959.
   John Raitt will sing ``Bill's Soliloquy'' from ``Carousel,''
which opened here in 1945. Miss Holm will sing ``I'm Just a Girl
Who Can't Say No,'' from ``Oklahoma!'' which opened in 1943.
   Others stars featured include Yvonne DeCarlo, Robert Goulet,
Connie Stevens, Maureen Stapleton, Vincent Gardenia and the
Rockettes in the 90-minute show directed by Joe Layton, creative
director of Radio City Music Hall.
   From the 1930s to the 1960s, the Shubert was known as the
``birthplace of the nation's greatest hits.''
   Slides and film will be used to help retrace the theater's
history, starting with its opening in 1914 with the musical,
``Belle of Bond Street.''

   Lady Bird Johnson sank city officials'
plans to rename Town Lake in the former first lady's honor only
hours before the City Council was to make it official in a special
meeting.
   Mayor Lee Cooke proposed the idea during a 25th anniversary
celebration of President Johnson's inauguration, and a majority of
the council agreed. Cooke said he hadn't expected Lady Bird's veto
Tuesday.
   Mrs. Johnson, who helped develop and beautify the popular
recreation spot 20 years ago, wrote the officials that Town Lake
``will always be a special place for me, but I will feel very
self-conscious if it is named for me.''
   Mrs. Johnson noted that she had turned down previous proposals
and asked that the council ``follow my long-held wish.'' Cooke said
he accepts Mrs. Johnson's decision ``reluctantly and
disappointedly.''

   Architect Maya Ying Lin, who designed
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., when she was a
Yale student has returned to her alma mater to mark the arrival of
women undergraduates 20 years ago.
   Yale has commissioned Lin to design a sculpture to celebrate new
generations of Yale women on campus, culminating a yearlong
observance of the 20th anniversary.
   The monument ``is more about the future than commemorating the
past,'' Lin said Tuesday, and likely will include places where
``people can sit and enjoy themselves.'' She would not discuss
possible designs.
   In 1981 as a senior, Lin's design was chosen from 1,420 entries
for the Vietnam memorial, a black granite work inscribed with the
names of 58,000 Americans killed or missing. It is the most visited
monument in Washington.
   Lin also designed a monument to those slain during the civil
rights movement. The work was dedicated in Montgomery, Ala., in
November.

   Longtime civil rights figure and former
Fayette Mayor Charles Evers has filed for bankruptcy, records show.
   Evers, 67, who once owned several businesses in the small
southwest Mississippi town he led as mayor for 16 years, declined
to say why he filed for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   ``I think it speaks for itself,'' said Evers, who serves as
unpaid general manager of WMPR-FM, a Jackson public radio station.
   Evers was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1971 and in
1983, for the U.S. Senate in 1978 and for central district highway
commissioner in 1989.
   According to Tuesday's filing, Evers has less than $50,000 in
assets, less than $50,000 in debt and none of his assets will be
available for distribution to creditors.

   The number of Americans old enough to vote
this fall is up more than 3.6 million from two years ago, but the
odds are fewer will actually turn out.
   The nation's voting-age population will climb to 186,382,000 by
November's election, the Census Bureau projected on Wednesday.
   That's up from about 182.7 million two years ago, the bureau
said.
   But the absence of a presidential contest this year means there
will probably be less public interest and so a lower turnout.
   An estimated 50.1 percent of voting-age Americans voted for
president in the 1988 general election. In 1986, the last
congressional election year without a presidential vote, only 33.4
percent voted.
   The new Census report shows the aging of the giant post-World
War II Baby Boom generation is continuing to place the bulk of
voters in the 25-to-44 age group.
   That segment of Americans will make up 43.9 percent of eligible
voters, up from 43.5 percent two years ago and 38.5 percent in 1980.
   The smaller generation that followed the Baby Boom means the
younger age group is losing potential political influence.
   Voters aged 18-to-24 will be only 13.8 percent of those eligible
this fall, down from 14.5 percent in 1988 and 18.4 percent in 1980.
   The middle aged, those 45 to 64, will be 25.2 percent of voters,
down from 25.3 percent in 1988 and 27.3 percent in 1980.
   But voters aged 65 and over will be 17 percent, an increase from
16.7 percent two years ago and 15.7 percent in 1980.
   Women will outnumber men in the voting age population by 97.1
million to 89.2 million, the report shows.
   Men have a slight edge in the 18-to-24 group, but women
outnumber them at older ages. As women tend to live longer than
men, the biggest margin is at age 65 and over, with 18.8 million
women and 12.9 million men.
   The voting-age population will include 21.1 million blacks and
6.1 million persons of other races, such as Asians, Pacific
islanders and American Indians.
   Although the report lists all Americans aged 18 and over as part
of the voting-age population, the bureau noted not all are eligible
to vote. Included are about 6.6 million legal aliens, 2.8 million
illegal aliens and 850,000 persons in prisons or mental hospitals
who are not eligible to vote.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Ministers Discuss Slashing Nuclear Arsenal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANANASKIS, Canada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers met today to
discuss slashing their arsenal of battlefield nuclear weapons now
that political changes in Eastern Europe have dramatically reduced
East-West tensions.
   The officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gathered
in the majestic Rocky Mountains of western Canada for their first
nuclear strategy talks since pro-democratic revolutions swept
through Eastern Europe last year.
   Upon arrival Tuesday, the alliance's secretary-general, Manfred
Woerner, described the discussions as ``very important'' in laying
the groundwork for ``a more peaceful, more secure future.''
   ``We will start adjusting our nuclear posture to the future ...
to make sure that we continue to prevent (war) with less weapons
and hopefully also with less soldiers,'' he said.
   Just days before the meeting, President Bush announced the
cancellation of plans to build a more powerful short-range nuclear
missile and a modernized 155mm nuclear-tipped artillery shell.
   Even before the American decision, there was a growing feeling
among NATO diplomats that the West could safely reduce, if not
eliminate entirely, its arsenal of land-based tactical missiles and
artillery in Europe.
   Those weapons, most deployed in West Germany, were designed to
hit targets in countries of Eastern Europe that have now improved
ties with the West.
   German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, on his arrival late
Monday, said it was possible that all land-based nuclear systems in
Europe would be withdrawn. ``Of course,'' he told reporters, ``the
requirement is the readiness of the Soviet Union to withdraw their
own systems.''
   ``It cannot be unilateral,'' he said. ``It must be on both
sides.''
   It was unclear if the defense ministers, meeting as the Nuclear
Planning Group, would announce changes in their nuclear arsenal at
this meeting.
   Some officials thought it more likely NATO would delay any
announcements until the end of a series of high-level meetings this
month and next on the alliance's future and its need for nuclear
and conventional forces.
   The discussions will wind up with a summer summit of Bush and
other leaders of the 16 nations.

<HEAD>Flooding in Texas, Arkansas Sweeps Away Cattle Along With Homes</HEAD>

   Floodwaters swept away homes, cattle and crops as the
rain-swollen Arkansas River reached a record level, and the
National Guard was called in to shore up a levee weakened by the
worst flooding in northern Texas in 80 years.
   In Arkansas, farmers hogtied calves for transport and residents
sandbagged their homes as the Arkansas River on Tuesday hit a
record 27.6 feet _ four feet above flood stage _ at Little Rock.
More than 300 families were forced from their homes.
   ``People are just devastated. All you can see from here is
rooftops and water,'' said Donna Booth Johnson, local Red Cross
executive director. ``One guy left his refrigerator, thinking that
since the motor was sealed, it would be OK. It floated off, along
with the microwave he had put on top of it.''
   In Texas, more than 1,600 people have sought shelter from
flooding along the Trinity River. Gov. Bill Clements authorized the
National Guard to send 50 soldiers to shore up a weakening levee on
the Red River near Texarkana.
   Hundreds of volunteers patrolled the river today, anxiously
scanning levees for breaches a day after water broke through the
top of a 60-foot-long section of levee, swamping several two-story
homes. Authorities said the river was expected to crest today and
maintain its swollen level for two days.
   The water level at Lake Texoma on the Oklahoma line continued to
fall after cresting at a record 644.76 feet above sea level, 27
feet above normal.
   Thirteen deaths have been blamed on the weather in the past two
weeks, one in Oklahoma and the rest in Texas.
   In Arkansas, a threat of rain raised fears of more flooding in
Little Rock even as the crest of floodwaters moved downstream today
toward Pine Bluff, 40 miles to the southeast. The National Weather
Service forecast a 30 percent chance of thunderstorms today and a
good chance of rain and thunderstorms on Friday.
   ``Lord, we don't need this and neither do any of these other
people,'' said Gary Stone, standing outside his parents' house in
North Little Rock. ``If the water comes over those sandbags, it's
all over. It's going to be a shame for all of us to have fought
this thing so long and then lose because it starts raining.''
   At least 400 homes have been heavily damaged or submerged by the
Arkansas River, state officials said. The river also has swept away
cattle, including all but 67 of a herd of 250 in Conway County,
upstream from Little Rock.
   ``A few of them floated down river and walked out and a few of
them floated down river and didn't walk out,'' said Conway County
extension agent William Nelson.
   Felix Brown and his sons and grandsons saved a herd of 170 attle
stranded on an island near Pine Bluff. Brown said they hogtied 40
calves Saturday and took them out by fishing boats, and found a
barge big enough to ferry out the rest.
   In Texas, the Trinity and Red rivers have engulfed farmland
along with hundreds of businesses and homes.
   In Ellis County south of Dallas, an estimated 20,000 acres
planted in wheat, corn, sorghum and cotton were inundated after
levees on the Trinity failed.
   ``I think it's going to pretty well put me out of business
unless we get some government help,'' said Charlie James, who said
all but 100 of his 1,800 acres of crops were washed out. ``I don't
really know what the alternatives are.''
   Upstream on the Trinity, between Dallas and Fort Worth,
International Wildlife Park, where floods killed 10 animals this
year and 20 animals last year, will be moved to a flood-free
location, owner Micky Hunt announced.
   Seven deer, two antelope and one ostrich died in last week's
flooding. Some animals had been moved to area zoos or Hunt's second
wildlife park, in Ohio, but many were forced to scramble for high
ground.
   ``It's very devastating to have an outside factor that you have
no control over rob you of a major tourist attraction,'' Grand
Prairie Mayor Jerry Debo said.
   Hunt said he would find a new location in the Dallas-Forth Worth
area.

   The fire that killed one sailor and injured
18 on a guided-missile destroyer was so hot it made the decks
bubble and melted firefighters' breathing masks on their faces.
   It was a ``major league fire'' that could have destroyed the
27-year-old USS Conyngham, said Capt. Joseph W. Perrotta Jr.,
skipper of a rescue vessel.
   The Navy declined to comment on a possible cause of the fire,
one of two fatal incidents on Navy ships Tuesday.
   Navy officials said the fire started early Tuesday in the
forward boiler room when the boiler was being lit. Fire and smoke
spread quickly upward, filling berthing areas, the Command
Information Center and the bridge. The Command Information Center
is the ship's nerve center with communications, radar and sonar.
   The Conyngham docked early Wednesday, 21 hours after the fire
erupted about 100 miles southeast of Norfolk, said Lt. j.g. Karl
Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman.
   Portholes were broken out along the right side of the vessel and
a 12-foot-long scorch mark was visible just above the waterline at
mid-ship.
   Perrotta, skipper of the USS Normandy, said that when his ship
approached the Conyngham, smoke was pouring out of the ship's
forward stack area and bridge. The Normandy provided additional
firefighting equipment and personnel to help the Conyngham crew
control the blaze.
   Cmdr. William R. Williams, the Conyngham's skipper, had ordered
the affected spaces evacuated, leaving the ship dead in the water
and without communications, and formed firefighting crews, Perrotta
said.
   The main fire was extinguished in about 2{ hours by the ship's
383-man crew, but sailors continued to monitor conditions because
of the intense heat held by the aluminum decks and bulkheads,
Perrotta said.
   ``The ship could have been lost if not for the gallant effort of
the crew,'' he said.
   Seaman James Choss, an electrician aboard the ship and one of
the injured, told his mother he was getting ready for bed after
working most of the night in the Combat Information Center when the
fire broke out.
   ``He said a fuel pump blew down in one of the boilers'' and
that's what started the fire, Elizabeth Choss said from her home in
Hammond, Ind.
   ``One of the other guys in the room was hit by a fireball that
singed his hair,'' said Mrs. Choss. She said her son described
hallways filled with smoke, holes burned in the floor, masks on
firefighting gear that melted onto the faces of his shipmates and
``decks that were bubbling' in the intense heat.
   After the main fire was put out, the Conyngham was able to get
under way on its own, but Williams shut down the boilers when a
fuel leak was discovered. The ship was towed back to port, where it
was met by about 200 crewmembers' family and friends when it docked.
   While the ship was in tow, a team of Naval Investigative Service
agents was flown to the vessel to begin looking for the cause of
the fire, said Lt. Cmdr. Deborah Burnette, a U.S. Atlantic Fleet
spokeswoman. The commander of Destroyer Squadron 10, Capt. Raymond
Sharpe Jr., will head the investigation of the accident.
   Killed in the fire was Lt. Algernon Pope Gordon Jr., 34, of
Montgomery, Ala. Gordon was the Conyngham's operation's officer, in
charge of collecting, evaluating and disseminating tactical
information.
   Twelve of the 18 injured where flown to the Portsmouth Naval
Hospital and to a hospital trauma center. Six others walked off the
ship when it docked.
   Navy officials said none of the injuries were serious, and five
crewmembers were released from the naval hospital Wednesday.
   At the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on Tuesday, Petty Officer 3rd
Class Norbert Thomas Hanke of Lousiville, Ky., died after being
struck by debris when the propeller of a hovercraft disintegrated.
The accident occurred during small boat manuevers.

   Cockroaches, centipedes and crabs are
skittering on teensy-weensy treadmills to help scientists learn
more about how the little critters get from here to there.
   So far, biologist Robert Full's research team has found that
insects run rather than walk, and that cockroaches, beetles, dogs
and humans all use the same basic gait when they run.
   Crabs, however, gallop.
   Full's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley,
contains a series of miniature treadmills in airtight plastic
boxes. Air tubes connected to the boxes allow Full and his students
to measure itty-bitty amounts of oxygen consumed by jogging
cockroaches.
   The scientists also can measure the force exerted by insects'
individual footfalls.
   Each insect or crab is put through its paces for 10 to 15
minutes at a time in a series of tests lasting a couple of weeks.
   Full found the amount of energy a creature uses getting from one
place to another has nothing to do with how many legs it has, or
even how smoothly it runs or walks.
   Instead, energy expenditure depends on the amount of force
produced by leg muscles and the amount of time it takes each leg to
go through a whole cycle of movement.
   ``This seems to be true all the way from an awkward marathon
winner to a centipede weaving over the ground,'' Full said.
   Researchers also learned that the energy required to walk or run
depends largely on the force needed to hold the body up against
gravity, and not so much on mechanical power needed to swing the
legs and propel the body forward.

   A judge today ordered the Army Corps of
Engineers to bow to the wishes of three states and limit releases
of water from Lake Oahe until June 1 in order to protect fishing.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy granted a request by North
Dakota, South Dakota and Montana to stop the corps from lowering
the reservoir by 3 feet until the end of the month. The states
contend the May release of water from Lake Oahe wipes out the
lake's walleye spawn.
   The corps filed a notice today that it will appeal, U.S.
attorney Steve Easton said.
   Officials of the three states said the legal dispute reflects
growing anger at the corps' management of the entire Missouri
system during a drought now entering its third year in the upper
Great Plains.
   ``The fish spawn are symptomatic of a much bigger problem,''
said former South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, attorney for the
three states. ``That's the neglect, the abuse and the disregard
that ofttimes comes from people within the bureaucracy that make
decisions.''
   The lake is in North and South Dakota. Montana joined in
contending the corps is managing the system in favor of navigation
in lower basin states to the detriment of recreation and wildlife
in upper basin states.
   Charles Findlay, a Justice Department attorney representing the
corps, argued Tuesday that Conmy had no authority to dictate how
the agency should manage its system of six Missouri River dams.
   But Conmy said today he was ``unwilling to accept an
interpretation that would place any governmental agency beyond the
scope of judicial review of actions having a direct economic effect
upon thousands of citizens.''
   The corps has many complex considerations to make in deciding
how to handle the system, Findlay said, arguing that Conmy's order
would not be in the public interest.
   If the lake falls dramatically, walleye eggs laid in shallow
water will be exposed and destroyed, Janklow argued Tuesday before
Conmy.
   That would deal a $20 million blow to Dakota tourism, said
Janklow.
   ``We don't live in wealthy states ... We have very limited
economic opportunities available to us,'' he told Conmy.
   The three states' request would effectively end shipping in the
Missouri's navigation channel, which stretches from Sioux City,
Iowa, to St. Louis, the corps' attorney said.
   Shipping contributes only $14 million in benefits to the system,
compared with $67 million in benefits from fishing and recreation,
Janklow said.
   The states' request also could harm the nesting of two federally
protected rare birds, the piping plover and interior least tern, he
said.
   Janklow countered the birds would not be affected.
   Governors of North Dakota and South Dakota attended Tuesday's
hearing as did top attorneys from the Dakotas, Montana, Nebraska,
Iowa, Kansas and Missouri.

<HEAD>Administration Opposes New Fund to Fight CFCs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Bush administration opposes setting up an
international fund to help poor countries decrease their production
of ozone-depleting chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, the
White House said today.
   While the administration wants so-called CFCs eliminated and
believes ``financial assistance should be made available'' to help
developing countries do that, President Bush feels that resources
in existing international agencies are sufficient to handle it,
said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
   The idea of a $100 million special fund to help developing
nations was to be raised at an international conference on CFCs,
which U.S. representatives are attending in Geneva, according to
The Washington Post. The newspaper said the proposal seeks money to
help the Third World countries convert to alternative chemicals and
identify ways to replace CFCs.
   CFCs are used widely for refrigeration and some aerosol
products, and their emission is depleting the ozone layer that
protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays.
   ``The United States believes that the health of the global
environment is everyone's responsibility and must be addressed. We
support a worldwide phaseout of CFCs,'' Popadiuk said in a prepared
statement. ``The United States agrees that financial assistance
should be made available to help developing countries phase out
production of CFCs. However we believe it is more sensible to use
existing institutions and existing financial mechanisms already
established by the World Bank.''
   It would not be sensible, he said, to set up a new fund that
would create ``new rules, regulations and procedures that will have
to be negotiated for every new protocol.''
   ``The World Bank should use existing resources,'' he said.
   He did not elaborate on how the World Bank might reroute
existing resources for the effort.
   The administration has come under criticism by environmentalists
previously for what they say is foot-dragging on the question of
eliminating CFCs and failing to keep up with the leadership of more
aggressive European nations.
   The administration endorsed the idea of phasing out CFCs last
year, after it was proposed by Europeans.

<HEAD>German Reunification Casts Shadow on Soviet Victory Day
Celebrations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet World War II veterans Wednesday celebrated
their defeat of the Nazis 45 years ago, but worried that a reunited
Germany could once again threaten their homeland.
   A senior naval officer thought a reunified Germany so repulsive
he responded angrily when asked about the issue: ``I killed Germans
then, and if I have to, I'll kill them again!'' He refused to give
his name and stormed off.
   Thousands of gray-haired veterans took advantage of bright
spring weather to don their uniforms, pin on their medals and
gather in parks to recall the conflict they call The Great War for
the Fatherland.
   It was their first Victory Day celebration since East Germany's
hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker was swept from power, the
Berlin Wall was opened and negotiations began on reuniting East and
West Germany.
   Most of the half-dozen veterans interviewed in Sverdlov Square
outside the Bolshoi Theater after an official military parade in
nearby Red Square said they would tolerate a reunited Germany only
if it were neutral, belonging neither to the NATO nor Warsaw Pact
military alliances.
   ``I'm not against the reunification of Germany but I am against
war with Germany, making sure it is not repeated,'' said retired
Air Force Lt. Ivan D. Morozov, who said he met U.S. soldiers on the
Elbe River in Germany at the close of the war.
   Asked which alliance Germany should join, he said: ``It
shouldn't be in any bloc. There just should be peace on earth so
people don't know war.''
   Morozov held red tulips and wore a brown jacket with four rows
of silver and gold medals. Nearby, a group of women accompanied by
an accordion sang of the heroism of Soviet soldiers.
   Gen. Ivan Petrov, who served on the Ukrainian front, said he
also believed Germany should be neutral if its citizens choose that
course.
   ``Let the German people decide themselves,'' said Petrov, who
was interrupted by children giving him flowers.
   He echoed the Kremlin compromise suggestion that if a reunited
Germany could not avoid joining one military alliance, it should
remain in both.
   Soviet officials have suggested that a united Germany belong to
both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact
until undefined European ``security structures'' are created to
maintain stability. Bonn and Washington reject this, saying Germany
should belong only to NATO.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has said his
people should have a special say in discussions on German
reunification because they suffered so much in World War II. Twenty
million Soviets were killed.
   Fears abounded among the veterans that a reunited Germany could
become an aggressor.
   ``Unification is good but there must be a guarantee of the
security of all people, especially those who suffered the most from
Hitler. It's in the center of Europe, so it must be a peaceful
country,'' said Col. Vasily Kovalev, 63. An artillery regiment
commander, Kovalev wore a dark green dress uniform and held orange
and red tulips.
   Nearby, Lt. Konstantin Trepakov said in broken English that the
wartime allies, the Soviets, French, British and Americans, would
join again to fight Germany if it became a threat.
   A wartime buddy, Lt. Col. Konstantin Palkin, interrupted: ``I'm
skeptical. I don't exclude the possibility of (German) revenge. Our
World War II allies won't allow that.''
   Another veteran standing in the group, wearing a blue
paratrooper's beret, said he did not believe a neutral Germany
would be safe.
   ``It could develop strongly on its own and could not be
controlled by the Americans or anyone else,'' said the veteran, who
did not give his name.

   President Bush and congressional leaders
agreed today to open negotiations on a deficit-reduction package
that may include tax increases as well as deep spending cuts.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced the talks after
Senate and House leaders met with Bush for more than an hour in the
Oval Office to discuss the widening 1991 budget gap.
   Fitzwater said the negotiatations would begin next Tuesday. He
said whether taxes are included in any compromise was ``a matter
for the negotiators to consider.''
   Although Bush won the White House pledging ``no new taxes,'' he
abandoned that pronouncement this week in face of the spiraling
federal deficit.
   ``Severe action needs to be taken,'' Fitzwater said today,
blaming the nation's worsening deficit situation on rising interest
rates, reduced revenues to the Treasury and a previous
underestimate of the costs of the savings and loan bailout.
   ``The table is clean,'' Fitzwater said, suggesting that tax
increases could be part of the eventual compromise. ``We are
setting the stage for open and fruitful discussions.''
   Congressional leaders, speaking with reporters outside the White
House after the meeting, generally steered away from questions
about tax increases.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said: ``I think there is
an understanding we'd like to avoid'' the automatic spending cuts
that would be triggered in the absence of a budget agreement.
   ``No decisions have been made other than to begin discussions
next week,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   And House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said that there
were limits to what negotiators can do faced with the need to make
up to $100 billion in cuts.
   Budget slashes of such magnitude run the risk of being
``injurious'' to the economy, Michel said.
   Foley said he has appointed Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri,
the Democratic majority leader and an outspoken critic of the
administration, to chair his delegation to the talks. The speaker's
other negotiators are: Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the
majority whip; and Reps. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, Jamie
Whitten of Mississippi and Leon Panetta of California, the
Democratic chairmen of the Ways and Means, Appropriations and
Budget committees, respectively.
   Michel said the House Republicans would be Reps. Newt Gingrich
of Georgia and the ranking Republicans on those same three
tax-writing and finance committees, Reps. Bill Archer of Texas,
Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts, and Bill Frenzel of Minnesota.
   Mitchell said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., would be his ``personal
representative'' to the talks, along with Sens. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and James Sasser, D-Tenn., the
chairmen of Appropriations, Finance and Budget respectively.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., was expected to name
his representatives later today.
   Budget Director Richard Darman told Congress on Tuesday that $50
billion to $100 billion might be needed in deficit-fighting steps
this year _ between two and three times more than the savings Bush
said would be needed when he submitted his budget last January.
   Fitzwater said Bush would not participate directly in the
meetings but would monitor them closely and ``will be involved as
necessary.'' He said the three-way negotiations will be conducted
by teams from the House, Senate and White House.
   Earlier, Michel urged GOP lawmakers to ``hold their fire'' and
stop criticizing the budget efforts by the White House and
congressional leaders.
   ``Nobody wants to make a tough choice,'' Michel said after
meeting with House Republicans this morning.
   Fitzwater said that, from the president's vantage point, the
special budget negotiations have four basic objectives:
   _Reducing the deficit ``substantially on a multi-year basis.''
   _Allowing the economy ``to grow at a continued strong pace.''
   _Overhaul the congressional budget process.
   _To ``avoid the adverse economic and programmatic effects of a
stalemate that might otherwise ensue.''
   Fitzwater said there was no specific timetable for forging an
agreement. But, he added, ``all parties feel that it's in the best
interests to try to move this process forward immediately.''
   Although until recently Fitzwater and other administration
officials have issued optimistic assessments of the economy,
Fitzwater declared that economic ``growth is low at this point''
and the nation's economy is weakening.
   ``There is no hiding from that,'' Fitzwater said. ``We do have
an economic problem that we need to deal with.''
   Some Republicans have vowed to oppose any tax increases that
might emerge from the talks.
   Michel, asked what he told GOP colleagues after meeting with
them this morning, replied: ``Hold their fire, keep their powder
dry. Don't be quick to criticize when they're not a party to
whatever is being negotiated.''
   On Tuesday, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who heads the
National Governors Association, warned Bush to expect an uprising
from the states over proposals for a national sales tax. ``States
are going to dig in very strongly against a national sales tax,''
Branstad said. ``I think that would be a big mistake.''

<HEAD>Women's Advocacy Group Calls For Revisions In Pension Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advocacy group recommended Wednesday that
person who stay home to care for children or disabled family
members be given Social Security credit.
   The Older Women's League said current law penalizes women, who
are more likely than men to leave the work force for family duties
that give them no credit in the Social Security system.
   The group released a report that executive director Joan
Kuriansky said ``shows in brutal detail what is in store for
America's mid-life and younger women.''
   The report said that federal pension policies mean unmarried and
widowed women who retire 30 years from now are much more likely to
live in poverty than either married women or men.
   At fault, the report said, are Social Security and private
pension systems that favor the ``traditional family'' and so
benefit men. OWL said fewer than 10 percent of American families
fit the traditional profile of a working father, homemaker mother
and two children.
   ``There are system-wide inequities ... that will continue to
penalize women,'' OWL President Lou Glasse said at a news
conference, where release of the report was timed to precede
Mother's Day this Sunday.
   ``Pension eligibility has generally required long-term,
continuous full-time service with one employer _ a bad fit for
women,'' she said.
   Glasse said Congress should at least allow debate on the idea of
Social Security credit for non-working ``caregivers.''
   ``Policy makers should realize that women do move in and out of
the workforce,'' Kuriansky said.
   OWL also called on Congress to:
   _Mandate portable pension plans, so that people who change jobs
may take with them all retirement contributions.
   _Reduce from five the maximum number of years employers may
require for vesting.
   OWL claimed that for most women, ``decades of Social Security
contributions will translate into virtually the same retirement
benefits as those paid to their mothers, who may never have earned
wages or paid Social Security taxes.''
   The league said that 20 years into the next century, Social
Security and private pension plans will have practically ended
poverty among older men and couples, but financial problems will
remain widespread for single women.
   Glasse said women 30 years away from retirement are ``already in
jeopardy.''
   The report said the 55-year-old Social Security system and
private pension plans penalize women, who typically live longer
than men but earn less money. The OWL said 70 percent of Baby Boom
women will outlive their husbands by about 15 years but, on
average, will earn about two-thirds the pay for men their age.
   ``If our nation's Social Security and pension programs remain
fundamentally unchanged, the retirement income future is unlikely
to get any brighter for women,'' the league said.

<HEAD>Still Reading After All These Years: Literary Clubs Head Into 2nd

   It is 2 o'clock on a Thursday somewhere in the
lush and leafy suburbs. A bell rings. A woman opens a book and
reads aloud the treasured words of Herman Melville's ``Moby Dick''
while 21 women listen in rapture.
   Welcome to The Thursday Club, where great books have been read
aloud every week for 100 years. And while most of its members are
elderly, the club and others like it are thriving.
   No one knows how many Americans belong to such clubs, which can
trace their origins to before the Civil War when housewives found a
way to awaken sleeping intellects. But according to Bowdoin College
Professor Theodora Penny Martin, the impulse persists.
   Ms. Martin gets a glimpse of this whenever she gives a talk
about her 1987 book on the early days of women's reading clubs:
``The Sound of Our Own Voices.''
   ``Women of middle age and even younger ... the minute they hear
about the clubs want to tell me about a book club they are in,''
Ms. Martin said in a telephone interview from Brunswick, Maine.
   ``There still is that sense of wanting to be intellectually
alive outside their jobs, and also a sense of wanting to be part of
a circle of women,'' she said.
   The Thursday Club, with two members in their 90s and most in
their 60s and 70s, is still the exclusive, invitation-only group it
was in 1890.
   Members still take turns being hostesses of readings every
Thursday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., October to May. The routine,
strictly kept, is one hour of reading from a book of lasting value,
such as works by James Joyce, Charles Dickens, Homer, Goethe and
Confucius. They also read more contemporary writers such as James
Baldwin, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Alice Walker and Thomas Mann.
   A brief break follows, with water the sole refreshment. Then
comes an hour of lighter fare, such as poetry or plays.
   ``I feel as though I am witnessing the last members of a very
special generation ... raised by Victorian grandmothers. I don't
think there are women who are like this anywhere. (It's) a rarefied
little group,'' said Deborah Youngman.
   At 39, Ms. Youngman is ``the baby,'' as one member described the
doctoral candidate in human development.
   ``I imagined it would be the quintessential bluestocking affair.
It was not. I also assumed it would be a marvelous opportunity to
observe local High Quaint,'' said the native Californian now living
in Belmont.
   ``I couldn't have been more naive ... they are rather more than
middle-aged, rather more than middle-class, white, clad in good old
wool and sensible shoes. They're very, very serious.
   ``They are rich and evocative but not in cakes and tea,'' Ms.
Youngman said.
   Such reading clubs began in the Midwest in 1860 and reached
their heyday around 1900, when membership was estimated at nearly 1
million, typically comprising well-off housewives with children in
school and servants at home.
   For a long time, the literary gatherings provided women unable
to attend college a place to use their minds. But early in this
century, women were finally getting into many schools and reading
clubs began to fall by the way.
   The clubs also felt the drain and distraction of women during
the two world wars. Further decimation occurred after the 1960s, as
the women who might have joined reading clubs poured into
universities and out again into professions.
   Group's like The Thursday Club may one day vanish. Ms. Youngman
said she fears that one day she will be its last member and the one
to take its archives to their final rest at the Belmont Public
Library.
   She should talk to Alfreda L. Irwin.
   Mrs. Irwin, 77, an author and journalist, is now in Chautauqua,
N.Y. But she still belongs to The Wednesday Club she joined as a
housewife in 1938 in Franklin, Pa.
   ``I go back and it's just marvelous because they have all these
wonderful, educated women who are just very anxious to participate
in this interesting club,'' she said in a telephone interview.

   A fire destroyed at least 60 homes and
blackened about 16 square miles in Michigan's parched Lower
Peninsula before being brought under control, and firefighters
welcomed midmorning rain.
   Three smaller fires covering a total of about one square mile
destroyed at least 20 homes in rural northern Roscommon and
southern Crawford counties, officials said.
   The larger fire broke out in a forested area in eastern Crawford
County Tuesday afternoon, forcing the evacuation of about 300
people, Grayling sheriff's officials said.
   One resident along the Au Sable River, Norbert Szkotnicki, said
he snuck past police barricades Tuesday evening to check on his
home. He found part of it burning.
   ``I got a chainsaw and cut off a (burning) corner of the
cabin,'' he said. Firefighters then arrived and doused the house,
saving it.
   ``My family has been here 110 years. My grandfather built that
house,'' he said. ``I wasn't going to lose it.''
   Another resident, William Witt, piled three elderly neighbors
and their five dogs into his car and fled as the fire reached his
driveway.
   ``When I saw the fire come through, I didn't worry about nothing
but dogs and people,'' he said today.
   The blaze was brought under control late Tuesday. Fire officials
worried about forecast winds of 10-20 mph today, but light rain
started falling at midmorning as four National Guard helicopters
dumped 185-gallon drums of water on areas that continued burning.
   ``Thank God for the rain,'' Crawford County sheriff's Deputy
Heide Miller said.
   Deputy Sheriff Mike Shearer said today that about 100 structures
had burned, including at least 60 homes.
   One firefighter was hospitalized for smoke inhalation.
   ``All you see are burned spots on the ground that used to be
homes,'' said firefighter Jed Blaauw.
   ``There will be a lot of broken hearts,'' said Bill Mahalak,
acting regional forest manager for the Department of Natural
Resources, as he drove past the burned homes along the Au Sable
River, known for its trout fishing.
   About 150 firefighters battled the blaze, officials said.
   A 14-square-mile area was evacuated Tuesday as gusts of more
than 20 mph pushed the fire at nearly 4 mph, said forest manager
Jim McMillan.
   But an unexpected change in the weather caused winds to shift,
blowing the fire back onto itself, firefighter Scott Heather said.
That and a brief rain gave firefighters enough of a break to plow
fire lines, officials said.
   ``We've had about a dozen saves,'' Dean Goss said late Tuesday
as he looked at the only house still standing in one section of
wood along the river.
   Around him, the flames on one house crackled and another behind
it smoldered in the dark, a stone chimney the only thing left
standing.
   Officials said the spring fire season is at its worst as warm
winds dried out last year's leaves before this year's growth had a
chance to get started.
   Much of the northern Lower Peninsula is 1 to 2 inches behind in
rainfall this spring, said state fire specialist Art Sutton.
   ``I've been terribly nervous,'' said Harry Selleck, manager of
the Muskegon State Park. ``The forest floor is not greening up so
far. It's become a real tinderbox.''

   Four survivors of a sunken Rhode Island sailing
vessel were rescued this morning from a raft 150 miles southwest of
Bermuda, the Coast Guard said.
   The survivors were picked up at 9 a.m. by the merchant vessel
Baron Trader, Coast Guard officials reported.
   They did not know if there were others on the the 57-foot
Misconduct, which hit a submerged object and sank en route to
Bermuda. The survivors' names were not released.
   The Baron Trader was expected to arrive at Baton Rouge, La.,
around midnight May 13.
   A search for Misconduct began 11 p.m. Tuesday after the Coast
Guard station in Woods Hole, Mass., picked up a report that the
boat owned by Paul Harron of Newport, R.I., was sinking.
   A Navy patrol plane couldn't find it. But a report from another
vessel that had been with Misconduct several days earlier prompted
the Coast Guard to send a C-130 from Elizabeth City, N.C., to
search south of Bermuda.
   The raft was located by the plane at 4:37 a.m. The plane
remained over the site to await arrival of the Baron Trader.

   The letters Michael Behnke gets brim
with such gratitude they can be heartbreaking.
   ``I just had to write and thank you for making my day, week and
year!'' wrote one correspondent from Westlake, Ohio.
   ``This letter changed me, it made me realize what I do is
terribly important,'' wrote another from Troy, Mich.
   Used-car salesmen in need of a hug? Worn-out parents feeling
neglected by their children?
   No. These letters came from high school teachers. They were
replying to an annual form letter from Behnke, admissions director
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   If teaching teen-agers is a thankless task, MIT doesn't think it
should be. Several years ago Behnke initiated the custom of
dispatching letters of praise to the educators who loomed large in
the lives of students newly admitted to the school as
undergraduates.
   The form letter goes like this:
   ``Each year, we ask students admitted to MIT to share with us
the name of a teacher who has been especially influential in that
student's development.
   ``We congratulate you on being named this year by _ '' and the
student's name is filled in. ``More importantly, we thank you for
the time, patience, expertise, love, discipline and all the other
qualities which have had such an important impact on your students.
You do the work from which we all benefit.
   ``Congratulations again on the respect you have earned from your
students.''
   Among the 1,800 questionnaires returned from incoming freshman
admitted for fall 1989, 1,265 teachers were cited. Behnke said
every year about 20 teachers thank him in turn for the letters.
   He feels he has tapped a deep need for recognition among
purveyors of the three R's.
   The MIT letter even reached that citadel of public expression,
Dear Abby. One teacher ecstatic about getting a thank you letter
from MIT sent a copy to the columnist and signed off: ``My Name is
Legion, My Address is Cloud Nine.''
   Behnke said he finds the teachers' responses moving _ and a bit
disturbing.
   ``You are both happy and sad that not more is done, that so
little can mean so much. It is troublesome.''
   Not that the subject doesn't have its lighter side.
   One New York educator with a sense of humor and a smart son
wrote along with his thank you this year that he had been cited
four times by former students. So, he said, Behnke recalled, `I
hope you pay attention when I write a letter of recommendation for
my own son.'''
   The son was admitted.
   The idea of giving due credit occurred to Behnke when he arrived
at MIT five years ago. The school was already collecting names of
teachers from incoming students. But MIT was only using the names
as contacts when recruiters went around the country seeking
top-notch young minds.
   Behnke, 46, a former high school teacher and the husband of one,
decided to lift those teachers' names out of the anonymity of the
databank.
   ``I know how much teachers appreciate hearing from students,''
he said, noting that high school teachers have the hardest time of
any getting audience feedback.
   ``It's hard for adolescents,'' Behnke said. ``If they show too
much excitement, they're accused of brown-nosing. It's not cool.''
   But youngsters take their cues from adults, he said. ``In
society, people get accustomed to not thanking people, in general.
   ``This is a very small gesture.''

<HEAD>Gantt Appeals to Foe to Forgo Senate Runoff in North Carolina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Harvey Gantt, the leader in North Carolina's Democratic primary
for Senate, appealed to his nearest rival Wednesday to forgo a
runoff in the spirit of party unity against arch-conservative
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
   In Ohio, the man who ousted scandal-tainted Rep. Donald ``Buz''
Lukens said his campaign was ``a mission to do what's right for the
district.''
   In other results of Tuesday's primaries, West Virginia Democrats
nominated Sen. Jay Rockefeller for a second term, but dashed former
first lady Dee Caperton's hopes of becoming state treasurer.
Rockefeller will face Republican John Yoder in November.
   Ohio Democrats pinned their gubernatorial hopes on Attorney
General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., setting up a November contest
with former Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich. Voters in Ohio's
Cuyahoga County approved a higher ``sin tax'' on liquor and
cigarettes to finance a new $344 million downtown sports complex
for baseball's Cleveland Indians.
   Former Democratic Reps. Ken Hechler of West Virginia and Katie
Hall of Indiana lost comeback bids, and 100-year-old Henry
Stenhouse finished last in a GOP congressional primary in North
Carolina.
   Atlantic City, N.J., Mayor James L. Usry came in second in a
seven-way race and will compete in a June 12 runoff against
Councilman Jim Whelan.
   Gantt, the black former mayor of Charlotte who was running in a
six-man field, fell short of the 40 percent mark that would have
guaranteed him the nomination. Under state law, the second-place
finisher can order a June 5 runoff, and Michael Easley, the
Brunswick County district attorney, did just that.
   ``We don't want to send our candidate into the fall armed with
less than 40 percent of the vote,'' Easley told reporters. ``There
appears to be no real consensus. It appears the voters ought to
hear more from Mike Easely and Harvey Gantt.''
   But Gantt urged Easley to reconsider.
   ``Before Mike Easley takes that walk to the Board of Elections,
he should consider unity over divisiveness,'' Gantt said. ``We
should not divert attention from the real challenge of defeating
Jesse Helms.''
   Thad Beyle, a political science professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said a runoff would be bad news for
Gantt.
   ``I think if you go on the basis of the political history of the
state, if a liberal or a minority doesn't win it in the first
primary, they'll lose it in the second primary,'' Beyle said.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Gantt led with 258,501
votes or 38 percent; Easley had 207,929 votes or 30 percent; former
insurance commissioner John Ingram had 119,363 votes or 17 percent;
ex-state Sen. Bo Thomas had 81,608 votes or 12 percent, and two
other candidates divided the remainder.
   Helms, seeking his fourth term, easily dispatched two token
opponents in the GOP primary, piling up 84 percent of the vote.
   In western Ohio's 8th District, Lukens finished third in a
four-way GOP primary. He had rejected calls for by party leaders
for his resignation following his misdemeanor conviction last year
for having sex with a 16-year-old girl.
   ``Never argue with the voters,'' said Lukens, who returned to
Washington on Wednesday, saying he planned to return ``to a normal
life.''
   State Rep. John Boehner, who won the primary, denied Lukens was
the issue.
   ``This race was never focused on Lukens,'' Boehner told
supporters. ``When I started last June, it was a mission to do what
was right for this district.
   ``... Buz was black and white. People were either with him or
against him. This race wasn't a popularity contest. It was about
who was the best candidate.''
   Boehner will face the Democratic nominee, Gregory Jolivette,
former mayor of Hamilton. The district is a GOP stronghold that has
consistently elected Republicans to Congress since the 1950s.
   With all precincts reporting, Boehner had 25,068 votes or 49
percent; former Rep. Thomas Kindness had 16,330 votes or 32
percent; Lukens had 8,681 votes or 17 percent, and Mort Meier, a
Hamilton bond underwriter, had 716 votes, or 1 percent.

   Burglars may have stolen copies of an
engineering exam during a break-in at two Naval Academy offices
during the weekend, but the exam was given as scheduled anyway, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The (Annapolis) Capital quoted unidentified faculty members as
saying copies of the test had been stolen, but academy spokeswoman
Carol Feldmann said no one was sure if copies had been stolen.
   ``We couldn't be sure that the test was compromised and we
couldn't be sure that it wasn't,'' Feldmann said. ``So we went
ahead and gave the test as is.''
   Midshipmen took the test Monday. The exams were for a required
electrical engineering course that is usually taken by midshipmen
in their junior year.
   The break-in was discovered about midday Sunday by engineering
faculty members, Feldmann said. The offices are in Maury Hall,
which is left open on weekends for studying.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II stepped off a raised,
fenced-off platform and plunged into a jammed prison yard today in
an unscheduled display of compassion as a convict chorus sang
Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy.''
   The pontiff then told about a thousand prisoners that ``the
worst prison is a closed heart,'' and urged them to keep up their
hope for a better life because ``Christ never loses hope in his
creatures.''
   The pope had been scheduled to greet only one prisoner _ a man
who had killed his wife _ before his brief speech, but John Paul
conferred with several assistants when he reached a platform that
had been set up in the prison yard.
   The prisoners were confined behind a high Cyclone fence, but the
pope descended from the platform, ordered that a gate be opened,
and strolled into the yard, greeting and blessing prisoners for 20
minutes.
   One prisoner showed off an injured foot, and others appeared to
be shaking with nervousness or joy as the pope approached. A prison
band played Mexican tunes, then broke into the ``Ode to Joy'' in
Spanish as the pope toured the yard. The ``Ode'' is the choral
finale to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
   The state prison in Durango holds about 1,200 prisoners,
authorities said, including convicted murderers and drug
traffickers.
   The pontiff was scheduled to address a crowd of businessmen on
their social responsibility during the afternoon.
   On Tuesday night, in a speech to diplomats in Mexico City, 450
miles to the southeast, the pope called for a moral as well as an
economic approach to the ``imprisoning'' foreign debt crisis.
   ``Technical measures are not enough to resolve the great
problems that menace international equilibrium,'' the pope told the
diplomats.
   ``I feel the obligation to underline ... the ethical dimension
of this imprisoning crisis,'' which, the pontiff said, was
hindering development in many poor nations of the world.
   John Paul met the diplomats after celebrating a Mass for young
people near a shrine at San Juan de los Lagos, 250 miles northwest
of Mexico City.
   There, he encouraged Mexico's young people not to be
disheartened by injustice and inequality and to use Christ as a
defense against despair.
   He said loss of hope in today's world was symbolized by
``evasion, abandon, hedonism, discotheques, drugs, indifference,
pessimism, the artificial paradises in which so many find refuge.''
   ``Young people, don't lose hope! You are the pilgrims of hope,''
the pontiff cried.
   More than 200,000 people packed the slopes of a hill outside San
Juan for the Mass on Tuesday. Many waved flags in papal white and
yellow or in green, the town's colors, and interrupted the pope
frequently with cheers and chants. Priests wore white robes and
yellow baseball caps to ward off the harsh sun.
   The town was one of the centers of a guerrilla war waged in the
1920s by Catholic conservatives opposed to the government's tight
religious restrictions, and memories of the conflict are still
strong. A large banner on a building facing the altar read ``Viva
Cristo Rey'' _ Long Live Christ the King _ the battle cry of the
Cristero rebels.
   In a morning address to teachers, the pope issued a veiled call
for a lifting of constitutional prohibitions on religious schools,
a prohibition that is ignored by many schools and even universities.
   ``Open the world of teaching to Christ!'' the pope said in a
speech at the airport in Aguascalientes, about 50 miles north of
San Juan de Los Lagos.
   Church-state relations are now at their best in 50 years, and
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari recently sent a personal
representative to the pope. The move was seen as a step toward
possible re-establishment of the diplomatic ties severed in 1926.
   ``I have observed with great satisfaction the significant and
important gesture of the president,'' the pope told the diplomats
on Tuesday evening.
   John Paul's eight-day trip is his 47th outside Italy since
becoming pope. He first visited Mexico in 1979.

<HEAD>Fighting Escalates In Battle Between Christian Militias for Ports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces escalated their
battle Wednesday for control of a strategic stretch of coastline,
killing 20 people and wounding 41 in fierce shelling duels, police
said.
   The barrages came after rebel Gen. Michel Aoun threatened to
attack ships using ports controlled by his rival Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militia.
   Aoun backed up his threat by using howitzer batteries deployed
in mountains northeast of Beirut to shell almost the entire length
of the Christian enclave's 28-mile Mediterranean coastline in an
effort to block Geagea's supply lines, a police spokesman said.
   Police said Aoun's gunners were shelling ports controlled by the
Lebanese Forces at Jounieh, Amsheet, Byblos and Beirut harbor.
   Geagea's fighters responded by firing salvoes from
multi-barrelled rocket launchers at territory controlled by Aoun's
19,000-man army, including a three-mile coastal strip around Dbaye,
where the rebel general has a makeshift port.
   ``Its the war of ports. They are shelling each other's sea
outlets,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations.
   ``The whole (Christian) enclave is on fire. It is a war of
destruction. No ground offensives are underway.''
   Police said the casualties included a family of three who were
killed when a 122mm rocket blasted their single-story house in the
Aoun-held mountain resort of Baskinta, northeast of Beirut.
   Casualties from the latest round of fighting raised the overall
toll to 972 killed and 2,564 wounded since Geagea and Aoun began
their battle for control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
on Jan. 30.
   The coastal battle has intensified since April 23 when Geagea
ordered his flotilla of 20 speedboats and one gunboat to blockade
Aoun's sea outlet at Dbaye to prevent the rebel forces from
receiving weapons and ammunition.
   Aoun, who has only two crippled gunboats trapped at Dbaye, has
relied on his howitzer batteries to shell his rival's ports.
   Jounieh, 12{ miles north of Beirut, is the terminal for a ferry
and hydrofoil from Cyprus. These vessels are the Christians' only
outlet from their enclave, which is ringed on its land sides by
Syrian troops and their Moslem militia allies.
   Aoun's headquarters issued a communique early Wednesday warning
local and international maritime agencies against serving any port
along the coast of the Christian enclave.
   The communique said Aoun had declared the Christian coast a
military operations zone.
   ``Sailing across it is banned to any vessel irrespective of its
type or cargo,'' it said.
   Geagea, in a defiant response, told the Christian Voice of
Lebanon radio that Aoun ``will not be able to squeeze us even if he
maintains his shelling for 10 years.''
   Smoke billowed from east Beirut's Ashrafiyeh district, a Geagea
stronghold, and the pinewoods of the Metn mountains, northeast of
Beirut, where Aoun's troops are entrenched.
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across Beirut, as radio
stations interrupted regular programming to blare appeals from
hospitals for blood donations to cope with the influx of casualties.
   Beirut's Moslem sector has not been involved in the Christian
fighting. About 400,000 of the Christian enclave's 1 million
population have fled the fighting, mainly to safer areas in
predominantly Moslem sectors of the nation.
   In another development, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Prime
Minister Salim Hoss drove to the Syrian capital of Damascus for
talks with President Hafez Assad on ways of implementing a peace
plan to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun has rejected the Arab League-brokered peace accord,
endorsed by Lebanon's parliament in the Saudi Arabian resort of
Taif in October, because it does not guarantee the withdrawal of
the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   He also refuses to recognize Hrawi's election to implement the
peace plan.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi and cautiously accepted the peace
plan, which calls for an equal distribution of power between
Moslems and Christians.

   A prisoner assigned to pick up litter
along a state highway has lived up to the name trustee.
   Hampton County Jail spokesman Richard McCarthy said Tuesday that
when the inmate discovered a bag discarded along the road
containing more than $1,100 in cash and checks, he gave it to a
corrections officer.
   The money and checks had been stolen in a Jan. 12 break-in from
the Office for the Aging in nearby Westfield.
   ``We never expected to see any of the money again,'' said Sophia
Bousquet, executive director. ``That young man should be commended
for his honesty.''
   She said no one has been arrested for the break-in, ``but we
recovered all but one of the checks that were taken and $470 of the
$750 in cash. And needless to say we are very happy.''
   McCarthy said state confidentiality laws prevented him from
releasing the name of the inmate or the nature of his offense
without the man's permission. He said the prisoner had been one of
a group of six trustees working to clean up roadways under the
guard of a corrections officer May 3.

   You remember how to do it: You put your right hand in. Take your

   On Friday, Bob Luckadoo intends to set the world's record for
doing just that. But he can't explain what exactly inspired him.
   ``I don't know if my defenses were down or if my creative was

School. ``But one day the idea all of a sudden sort of popped into
my head.''
   Luckadoo isn't the only one. The hokey-pokey muse has clobbered
otherwise normal folks in Indiana, Illinois and Texas this spring.
Like Luckadoo, they have told Mark Young, editor of the Guinness
Book of World Records, that they intend to establish a record for
doing the dance step.
   Guinness has no hokey-pokey record. It does have records for the
longest conga line (119,986 people) and largest dance (25,000 in a
1984 Buffalo tribute to Glenn Miller).
   ``I just can't figure out why everyboody wants to do the

<HEAD>Unemployment Surges in East Germany as Country Braces for More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a prelude to the massive unemployment
expected during the unification of the Germanys, the number of
jobless East Germans nearly doubled last month compared with March,
officials said Wednesday.
   Economic experts in both countries say the union of their
countries' economies will put tens of thousands of East Germans out
of work because dozens of dated and inefficient East German
companies will fold.
   The West German mark will replace the nearly valueless East
German mark on July 2, increasing pressure on East German
businesses unable to pay off massive debts in the hard currency.
   Also Wednesday, the 20 unions belonging to the East German labor
federation, Freie Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund, voted to disband the
organization and form a new one.
   For four decades the federation was the Communist-run labor
organization.
   Despite attempts to break away from government control, it has
been criticized for failing to adapt to change following the fall
of the hard-line Communist government last year and plans for
unification and a free market economy.
   The prospect of massive unemployment at the outset of
unification was one of the major issues in East Germany's March 18
elections, the first free balloting in the nation's history.
   Workers protested what they accurately predicted would be
widespread layoffs from once-guaranteed jobs.
   The Ministry for Labor and Social Affairs said Wednesday the
number of unemployed rose from 38,313 in March to 64,948 last month.
   They included 36,000 skilled workers and 16,000 unskilled
workers, according to the figures, distributed by the
government-run news agency ADN.
   ADN did not provide a figure for April unemployment as a
percentage of the total labor force. East Germany only recently
began releasing unemployment data, and its current figures are
considered incomplete.
   Officials said the number of job openings had ``slumped
considerably'' to 73,558 in April, but did not provide figures for
comparison.
   East Germany once had one of the strongest economies in the
Soviet bloc, but it has been plagued by inefficiency since the
beginning of the 1980s.
   Western experts say cumbersome central planning made East German
businesses slow to adapt to changes and trends. The same held true
for other countries in Eastern Europe that are now moving toward
market economies following the democratic reforms that have swept
the region.
   East Germany's economy suffered another serious blow in
September, when tens of thousands of skilled workers began fleeing
the country for West Germany. Even after the East Germans were
allowed full freedom of travel last November, workers continued
leaving in droves to West Germany.
   In all, more than 500,000 East Germans left the country from
January 1989 through March of this year.
   West German officials and business leaders are counting on
massive investment from the West to rebuild the East German economy.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   May 5
   Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier on the hostage situation:
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani is miffed that the United
States isn't falling over itself trying to thank him for helping
with the release of two American hostages in the past two weeks.
   The releases, though, are a little like a man agreeing to quit
beating two of his neighbor's 19 children: He's still whipping the
remainder.
   In this case, Rafsanjani and the terrorists in Beirut supported
by his government are inflicting the damage, while Western
countries wait for the release of 17 more hostages.
   Why should the United States or any of these other countries
make a goodwill gesture to terrorists who have robbed innocent
people of years of their lives and continue to hold them for no
apparent reason?
   Rewarding countries or terrorists for the release of the
hostages would be like paying ransom, which would only encourage
the seizing of more Westerners. ...
   At first, the captors, members of Islamic Jihad or ``Islamic
Holy War,'' wanted to trade their hostages for 17 comrades
imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies
there.
   That deal was rejected by former President Reagan long ago,
though.
   Since then, the kidnappers have turned the hostages into
representatives of their governments, protesting the presence and
policies of the United States and the other Western countries by
continuing to hold and threaten their captives.
   But during the last five years, the United States has reduced to
low levels its armed forces in the Middle East and put pressure on
Israel to begin talks with the Palestinians on a solution in the
occupied territories.
   What's more, U.S. officials have repeatedly stated they won't
deal with the kidnappers.
   These conditions have made the hostages more of a liability than
an asset for the kidnappers and those associated with them.

   Concord (N.H.) Monitor on the hostage situation:
   As freed hostage Frank Reed said this weekend, the taking of
hostages is a tactic as old as civilization. Captives can be traded
for arms, exchanged for prisoners or held by the enemy as insurance
against attack.
   But even in the United States, where reverence for the value of
the individual life is perhaps greater than anywhere else in the
world, the lives of hostages have never been more important than
geopolitics. ...
   So as much as Americans may rejoice in the release of Reed and
(Robert) Polhill, the president cannot rush to reward the hostage
takers and those who influenced them. ``I want to see all hostages
released,'' Bush said last week. What he meant was that Israel
should free some of the hostages it has taken, including Sheik
Obeid. But he could not afford to come out and say so.

   The Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on defense spending:
   Reality is beginning to soak in at the Pentagon, if Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's proposals for cutting advanced aircraft
spending is any indication.
   Still, it wouldn't be very difficult for someone such as, say,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, to find far deeper cuts that could be made in the
defense budget.
   Though Cheney has proposed cuts of about $35 billion between
1991 and 1997, that amounts to less than 2 percent of the original
figure _ about $2 trillion _ that the armchair generals and
admirals at the Pentagon had anticipated spending during that
period.
   Congress could _ and should _ demand far larger cuts.
   The Cold War is over. The Berlin Wall is no more. Eastern Europe
has rejected communism. The Warsaw Pact is falling apart. And the
Soviet Union itself is undergoing unprecedented internal turmoil.
   Yet, the Soviet Union remains a nuclear superpower. And, yes,
the United States must continue to maintain a strong defense,
keeping our guard up against any eventuality. Nonetheless, the
current course of events should make it clear that this country can
make far deeper spending cuts at the Pentagon than Cheney proposes.
   Every unnecessary defense dollar that is cut can add to
America's economic strength and, as the 1990s unfold, that strength
will perhaps mean far more to our national security than more
tanks, bombers and nuclear missiles.

   The Odessa (Texas) American on the United States and the Soviet
Union:
   President Bush has been praised for his caution, but his actions
make us wonder why.
   His administration announced an agreement to grant the Soviet
Union Most Favored Nation status, probably to be signed at the
summit between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   This follows Bush's recent refusals to even murmur a single word
of protest against the Soviet strangulation of Lithuania.
   Removing trade restriction between the free individuals of two
nations is always to be praised; free trade would advance the
freedom movement within the Soviet Union.
   But granting Most Favored Nation status also entails granting
the Soviet loan credits backed by U.S. taxpayers.
   And Bush's timing, even as famished Lithuanians see their food
and fuel supplies choked off, suggests an act of unprincipled
groveling.
   Couldn't he have waited? Or recognized Lithuania's independence
as a countermove? Would the summit have been endangered?
   Perhaps. But America's real strength in the world is not so much
its ability to negotiate deals with other powers, but rather its
adherence to principles of freedom and decency, which beg for
recognition of the Lithuanian people's courage.
   For now, the more Bush trusts Gorbachev the less Americans will
trust Bush.

   The Press-Enterprise, Riverside County, Calif., on the S&amp;L
bailout:
   The S&amp;L bailout will cost more than the bailouts of Lockheed,
Chrysler, Penn Central and New York City combined. By conservative
estimate. ...
   Chairman William Seidman of the Resolution Trust Corp., an
agency created last August to merge and sell insolvent S&amp;Ls and
their assets, ... has displeased President Bush with his candid
appraisals that the cost of all this was rising rapidly. The
president originally estimated the cost of the project at $166
billion over 10 years. The fact that independent assessments
support ... Seidman doesn't seem to matter (the GAO figures it
could run up to $500 billion over 30 years). George Bush wants ...
Seidman out. ...
   Seidman has tenure. He is in this job as an extension of his
first title, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. _ an
independent agency. Because the Senate confirmed him, the president
can't fire him. He doesn't have to leave until his term is up, in
October, 1991. ...
   If the truth about this bailout nettles George Bush, well, too
bad. Keeping top people on the job is the percentage play here. And
even a few percent of $500 billion makes it worthwhile.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on going metric:
   By 1993, the European Community is scheduled to have a unified
economy, larger than that of the United States, with all product
standards based on the metric system. But some U.S. exporters may
miss out on this vast market if they don't begin to adapt their
products to metric _ the measurement system used by most of the
world.
   Government agencies, as well as companies, have ... been slow to
adapt to a world of tens. The comptroller general's office cites a
study showing there has been little preparation for complying with
a law that agencies use the metric system as much as possible by
October 1991. The Commerce Department, which should be leading the
way because of its foreign-trade responsibilities, was particularly
faulted for not giving more leadership.
   It may be a great inconvenience for a while, but going metric is
one of those chores we will have to perform to compete in the
international marketplace, and the sooner the better. People may
still usefully employ the historic English system in their private
lives, but companies and government agencies should get to work on
the transition.

   The Star-Ledger, Newark, N.J., on the deficit:
   Reading President Bush's lips today is likely to bring forth a
different message than in the past, when he was adamantly against
new taxes. The president has given assurance that the budget talks
under way with Congress will be ``unfettered'' and will have no
``preconditions.'' Even new taxes, once a taboo subject, will be on
the agenda.
   Congressional leaders make similar optimistic murmurs. But no
official is predicting that the talks will really make a difference
in reducing the nation's enormous deficit _ and such caution is
more than warranted. ...
   There has been little or no progress in reducing the deficit
since the huge shortfall that followed passage of the delusive
Kemp-Roth tax cut legislation in 1981.
   There are several reasons for this failure to act by our elected
officials other than sheer irresponsibility. For one thing, we have
been spared the consequences of our huge deficit because foreigners
have been willing to borrow such large amounts in our credit
markets. ...
   The other is that there has been no political retribution
wreaked by the electorate on our spendthrifts. ...
   And so once again, the responsibility remains on the president
and Congress to agree on a plan that makes real deficit cuts. Fine
words won't do it. There have to be real reductions in spending
and, in all probability, tax increases as well.

   The Daily Telegraph, London, on a united Germany:
   The goal of the series of talks which started in Bonn over the
weekend must be not only the transfer of the wartime victors'
residual powers to a united Germany but also the opening of the way
to that ``common European home'' of which the Russians so often
speak.
   The removal of land-based nuclear missiles from Europe, further
cuts in conventional weapons, the strengthening of NATO's political
functions, a higher profile for the 35-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, a sympathetic response to the
Soveit Union's wish for integration into the world economy _ all
these are means of drawing Moscow out of its isolation on the
eastern periphery of the continent.
   The division of Germany into two hostile states was at the core
of post-war divisions. Transcending it should move Europe to the
threshold of a new unity.

<TEXT>
   Grant B. Cooper, an attorney who defended
Kennedy assassin Sirhan B. Sirhan, has died at age 87.
   Cooper died May 3 of an aortic aneurysm at the Hospital of the
Good Samaritan in Los Angeles, his wife, Phyllis, said Tuesday.
   A trial lawyer for more than six decades, Cooper continued
practicing law from his home until his death, Mrs. Cooper said.
   Born in New York, Cooper dropped out of high school and held
several odd jobs before coming to California as a hired hand on an
oil tanker. He accepted an offer from a lawyer uncle to go into
that profession and enrolled at Southwestern University. He
graduated in 1926 and passed the State Bar of California the next
year.
   As a prosecutor, Cooper won death penalties in several murder
cases. As a criminal defense attorney later in his career he
opposed capital punishment, claiming it did not deter murder.
   Cooper's most notorious clients were Dr. R. Bernard Finch in
1959 and Sirhan a decade later.
   He obtained two hung juries for Finch, who was accused with his
assistant, Carole Tregoff, of killing his wife, Barbara, in a case
that attracted national attention. Finch and Tregoff were convicted
when another attorney took over the defense in a third trial.
   Sirhan was convicted of the 1968 California primary election
night slaying of Sen. Robert Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel and
remains in prison.
   In addition to his second wife, Cooper is survived by two
daughters from a first marriage and one daughter and two sons from
his second marriage.

   The recording industry on Wednesday unveiled a
uniform warning label for albums with explicit lyrics and expressed
hope that an improved voluntary system will halt campaigns in some
states for mandatory labeling.
   The black-and-white stickers _ reading ``PARENTAL ADVISORY _
EXPLICIT LYRICS'' _ will appear on the lower right-hand corner of
the front of albums that might be objectionable because of lyrics
dealing with sex, violence, suicide, drug abuse, bigotry or satanic
worship.
   The decision of whether to affix the labels will be left up to
the record companies and their individual artists, said Jay Berman,
president of the Recording Industry Association of America, whose
members produce more than 90 percent of the records sold in the
United States.
   Berman said the warning labels will begin appearing on the outer
packaging, under the cellophane wrap, of potentially offensive
records, cassettes and compact discs reaching retail music stores
in July.
   The label size will range from 1{ inches by 1 inch for albums
and CD long boxes to 1 inch by a half-inch for cassettes and CD
cases.
   ``We believe the uniform logo will enhance the existing
voluntary system and better respond to the legitimate concerns ofserve
in that post, a U.S.
official said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Deer Harvest to Be Split Equally Between Chippewa, non-Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BUELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of deer to be hunted in northern
Wisconsin each year should be equally divided between the Chippewa
tribe and non-Indians, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb said equal division between
the state's six Chippewa bands and non-Indian hunters should assure
enough deer for both parties.
   Crabb's ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the Chippewa. Her
decision to limit tribal deer hunting to 50 percent of the
available resource contrasts sharply with her earlier ruling that
the Chippewa should be entitled to 100 percent of the ``safe
allowable'' catch of fish in northern Wisconsin.
   Crabb refused to discuss why her deer decision differed from the
one on fish catch.
   Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands retain the right to spearfish,
hunt and cut timber off-reservation on public lands in northern
Wisconsin under 19th-century federal treaties.
   Since a court affirmed those rights in 1983, the Chippewa have
exercised their spearfishing rights on northern lakes, encountering
huge and sometimes violent protests by outdoorsmen.
   The opponents argue that the special treaty rights are unfair
because they are denied to non-Indians.
   Since the court ruling affirming the rights, the Chippewa bands
have filed a series of lawsuits asking the court to define how much
of the resources of northern Wisconsin they are entitled to under
the treaties and to what degree the state can regulate tribal
activities.
   Crabb previously ruled the Indians are entitled to 100 percent
of the ``safe'' harvest of walleye on northern lakes during
spearfishing. Safe refers to the number of fish biologists say can
be taken without harming fish populations. She has yet to rule on
how much timber the tribe should be allowed to cut.

<HEAD>`60 Minutes' Commentator Says Timidity Led to Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Rooney's suspension from ``60 Minutes''
caused him to be more careful, but he says the entire episode ``was
a better example of timidity than it was a violation of my First
Amendment rights.''
   ``Broadcasters are hardly the only people to blame, of course.
The timidity with which the broadcast industry approaches seriously
controversial ideas is reflected by society ... or perhaps the
broadcast industry's timidity is a reflection of our society,'' the
CBS commentator said.
   In February, CBS News president David Burke suspended Rooney for
three months after an article published by the Los Angeles-based
gay lifestyle magazine Advocate attributed racist and homophobic
quotes to Rooney.
   Burke eventually shortened Rooney's suspension to three weeks.
   Burke decided ``between my right to say something and his
obligation to keep the peace between CBS and several minorities,
he'd better get rid of me,'' Rooney said Monday in a speech to
1,000 people gathered at a Constitutional Rights Foundation dinner.
   ``It's my personal opinion that my suspension was a better
example of timidity than it was a violation of my First Amendment
rights,'' he said.
   Rooney said we have become a nation ``that doesn't say what it
thinks about so many things'' and he faulted special interest
groups for squelching debate on television and in politics.
   ``There are organized minorities for almost every cause, and
politicians, along with network executives, are scared to death of
them,'' he said. ``Self-interest is what draws people to the voting
booth.
   ``Most people have the feeling that what happens in an election
won't matter much to them, so they don't vote. It's the people with
some personal cause, not those with a general belief in democracy,
who do the electing.''

<HEAD>Sailors Abandon Ship During Storm, Are Picked Up By Dutch Cargo
Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Connecticut sailing students on a
training trip abandoned ship during a storm and were picked up by a
Dutch cargo ship en route to Belgium, the Coast Guard said.
   And four survivors of a sunken Rhode Island sailing vessel were
rescued Wednesday from a raft 150 miles southwest of Bermuda, the
Coast Guard said.
   Carol's Dream, a 42-foot sloop owned by Carol Horne of Ledyard,
Conn., was three days out of Bermuda when it ran into a storm
Saturday 200 miles east of Cape May, N.J., said Coast Guard Chief
Brad Grueling in Boston.
   The boat's steering cable snapped, and its mast was in danger of
falling because of the rough seas, he said.
   Early Sunday, the crew sent out a distress call that was picked
up by Independent Accord, a 495-foot Dutch cargo ship carrying
tobacco from Chester, Pa., to Antwerp, Belgium. The cargo ship
reached Carol's Dream within an hour, said Edward Shea of Groton,
the sloop's co-captain, in a ship-to-shore conversation with the
newspaper The Day of New London.
   The two ships met in 30-foot seas, and Shea had to ram the
bigger ship three times to get close enough to transfer the
passengers. It took three attempts to get everyone safely off
Carol's Dream. One person suffered broken ribs.
   The Independent Accord is due to arrive in Antwerp next Monday
and the six Americans do not know yet how they will get home, Shea
said. They have been in contact with the U.S. Embassy in the
Netherlands to work out the problem.
   The trip was part of a sailing class conducted by Coastline
Sailing School &amp; Yacht Charters of Noank. The four students ``all
said they got their money's worth,'' Shea said.
   The four survivors of the Rhode Island sailing vessel were
picked up by the merchant vessel Baron Trader, Coast Guard
officials reported. They did not know if there were others on the
57-foot Misconduct, which hit a submerged object and sank en route
to Bermuda.
   The Baron Trader was expected to arrive at Baton Rouge, La., on
May 13.
   A search for the Misconduct began late Tuesday after the Coast
Guard station in Woods Hole, Mass., picked up a report that the
boat owned by Paul Harron of Newport, R.I., was sinking.
   A Navy patrol plane couldn't find it. But a report from another
vessel that had been with the Misconduct several days earlier
prompted the Coast Guard to send a plane to search south of Bermuda.

   Hate crime victims, some speaking through sobs
and some with unvarnished anger, described at a hearing Wednesday
the murders, stabbings, beatings and firebombings that have ravaged
their lives.
   ``My brother Jimmy was a kind, loving, caring person,'' said
Peggy Marlow. But because James Zappalorti was homosexual, she
said, two men stabbed him, slit his throat and threw him into the
water off his Staten Island home.
   ``They slaughtered him,'' Ms. Marlow said. ``All because he was
gay.''
   Others told of equally senseless attacks: A man who was called a
``faggot'' and viciously beaten, a black man whose home in a mainly
white neighborhood was firebombed, a rabbi whose synagogue was
daubed with pro-Nazi graffiti.
   ``I don't understand the hatred,'' said a woman, whose name was
withheld. She suffered cornea damage when the leader of a gang of
black youths jabbed her eye with a pin last year.
   Wilfred Phillips said he was ``so disappointed with the people''
of the neighborhood when saw his firebombed home in February. ``I'm
not accusing nobody, any one person. But I think it's a big
disgrace,'' he said.
   The hearing, called by City Council President Andrew Stein,
comes at a time of a dispute between black residents and Korean
grocers in Brooklyn, and jury deliberations are under way in last
summer's slaying of a black youth by a white gang.
   The number of hate crimes reported to police has more than
doubled since 1984, Stein said. And Inspector Paul M. Sanderson,
head of the bias squad, said two-thirds of the crimes have gone
unsolved.
   ``They are random, isolated and spontaneous,'' making arrests
difficult, Sanderson said. Still, he noted that in 2,900 cases the
squad has investigated since 1980, there have been 1,300 arrests.
   The problem is largely one of youth, Sanderson said: In 70
percent of the cases the perpetrators are younger than 19, and in
40 percent they are minors.
   The group that attacked Bruce Ellerin was made up of teen-agers.
One called him a ``faggot,'' he recalled. Words were exchanged and
they beat him so badly he suffered a broken cheekbone and a
detached retina.
   What worsened the ordeal, Ellerin said, was the police
insensitivity and indifference that followed. ``As soon as they
heard the word `faggot' they made up their minds that this was not
the most serious of incidents,'' he said.

   The 12-year-old son of a state
representative unintentionally cast a vote that killed a House bill.
   Brian Langton, son of Rep. Mike Langton, was sitting at his
father's desk last week while the Jacksonville Democrat left the
chamber to make a phone call.
   A vote came up on a bill that would create a statewide register
to document the number of children waiting for assistance from the
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   During his weeklong stint as a House page, Brian had seen his
father's green ``yes'' button light up many times. He decided to
see what the red ``no'' button looked like.
   He didn't expect to kill an important piece of legislation.
   ``Once he did it, he suddenly had all these legislators hulking
over him saying, `Did your dad tell you to do that?''' Langton
said. ``When I came back, the poor kid was frightened to death.''
   House members were scheduled to reconsider the bill Tuesday, but
the vote was postponed.
   Langton said he would have voted for the bill had he been there.
But Brian's ``no'' tied the vote at 53-53, effectively killing the
proposal.
   Langton said he gave his son ``a stern talking to,'' but that
Brian was embarrassed and felt bad enough without needing more
punishment.

<HEAD>Congressional Official Says Higher Gas Tax Could Go to General
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The budget adviser to Congress said Wednesday
the federal gasoline tax may be used for purposes other than
building highways and bridges.
   ``There is no fundamental economic or governmental reason for
earmarking tax revenues for specific purposes,'' W. David
Montgomery of the Congressional Budget Office told a Senate
transportation subcommittee.
   Montgomery also said the activities of the Highway Trust Fund
should not be split off from the rest of the budget.
   ``Taking the fund off-budget would make the budget a less
precise indicator of fiscal policy,'' he said. ``Finally, the
existence of the fund and the presence of cash balances can lead to
pressures for spending that impede deficit reduction and distort
budget priorities.''
   The Bush administration has also testified through the
Transportation Department that the activities of the multi-billion
dollar fund should not be set apart from the rest of the budget.
   Montgomery's testimony to the Senate Environment and Public
Works subcommittee on water resources, transportation and
infrastructure came in the second day of hearings on the use of the
government's highway and aviation funds.
   A House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee heard
testimony Tuesday.
   The two transportation funds are financed through fuel and
ticket taxes and other user fees. The proceeds are supposed to be
spent on highways, bridges, and air traffic improvements. A small
share goes to mass transportation.
   The funds have accumulated a $25 billion cash balance over the
years, but the real surplus is in dispute because large sums of the
highway portion are committed to future spending by states.
   A custody battle has developed over those funds between the
states, construction industry, rural lawmakers and congressional
public works committees on one side, and the tax- and
budget-writing committees of Congress and urban lawmakers on the
other.
   Money that goes out of the funds to repair crumbling bridges and
highways raises the overall deficit unless revenues increase
correspondingly.
   Wednesday's hearing was prompted by legislation by Sen. Richard
Bryan, D-Nev., that would force the government to release $9
billion in supposedly unspent trust fund dollars over the next
three years.
   In the House, Rep. Bob McEwen, R-Ohio, has introduced
legislation that would take the highway fund off budget.
   The hearing Wednesday came against the backdrop of budget
discussions between congressional leaders and the White House. An
increased fuel tax, advocated by House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., could emerge.
   Currently, each 11 gallons of gasoline purchased produces $1 in
federal tax revenue. Each 10-gallon purchase of diesel fuel other
than for passenger cars provides $1.50.
   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., said any increase in the gasoline
tax ``should not be earmarked.''
   ``I think this committee had better be thinking how those
revenues will be used,'' said Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
subcommittee chairman.
   The CBO's Montgomery said there was another impact of higher
fuel taxes: fighting pollution. ``Raising fuel taxes is a way of
charging users for polluting the air,'' he said.

   A cyclone battered the southern India coast
Wednesday with wind up to 155 mph, killing at least 11 people and
cutting off thousands of others from the rest of the country.
   The center of the storm struck the Indian mainland from the Bay
of Bengal at 6:30 p.m., 160 miles north of the city of Madras,
United News of India reported.
   Strong wind and towering 33-foot waves lashed the low-lying,
heavily populated coastline of Andhra Pradesh state, knocking down
hundreds of thatched huts, uprooting trees and downing power lines.
   Naval boats were battling rough seas in an effort to reach more
than 6,000 people in the coastal town of Yedurumudi who were cut
off by the storm from the rest of the country, rescue officials
said.
   Rescue workers evacuated more than 150,000 people during the day
from coastal districts in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states
before the storm struck, which kept the death toll down, said
Arjuna Rao, a top relief official in Andhra Pradesh's capital,
Hyderabad.
   He was reached by telephone from Madras.
   Indian news reports said the cyclone appeared to be stronger
than a 1977 storm that killed more than 10,000 people in southern
India, but few people were evacuated then.
   Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, Channa Reddy, said
telecommunications, power and transportation had ``completely
broken down'' in nine coastal towns.
   ``There is heavy devastation to property,'' he said, speaking to
reporters in Hyderabad.
   High wind knocked out telephone service and power in much of the
coastal area and the state government was relying on ham radio
operators to convey information. Army and navy helicopters and
boats assisted in the rescue and relief operations.
   The bulk of the damage was concentrated on a small peninsula
jutting out into the Bay of Bengal, where the center of the storm
hit.
   Six of the dead were killed when a wall collapsed in the East
Godivari district on the peninsula, United News said. Three others
were electrocuted when wind knocked down live electrical wires.
Another person died in a building collapse, and a 60-year-old
laborer died from exposure, the report said.
   In Madras, capital of neighboring Tamil Nadu state, electrical
wires knocked down by rain and wind preceding the storm killed
three people Tuesday.
   An Indian cargo ship carrying 60 passengers was initially
trapped in the storm, but escaped harm, Indian media reported.
   The government barred fishermen and sailors from putting out to
sea as the storm headed toward land.
   Cyclones are the Indian Ocean's equivalent of hurricanes. They
usually come in the spring just before the monsoon season begins.

   Liberian rebels have freed an American Peace
Corps worker and two Western relief officials who were kidnapped
along the Liberian-Guinean border last week, a French volunteer
agency said Wednesday.
   The agency, Doctors without Borders, said the three were
released unharmed. It said the hostages were forced to march for
seven hours to the rebels' main camp where they were questioned and
held captive for eight days.
   The three _ David Kelley of Illinois, Werner Will of West
Germany, and Ludov Pichrist of Belgium _ were released Tuesday
night, according to the Belgian chapter of Doctors without Borders,
a medical aid group.
   The captives were turned over to Ivory Coast officials and taken
to the Doctors without Borders office in Danane, Ivory Coast, the
statement said.
   Kelley, Will, Pichrist and a Guinean relief worker were
kidnapped on May 1 along the Liberian-Guinean border as they
inspected refugee facilities. The kidnappers later released the
Guinean, but held the other three.
   Doctors without Borders said the kidnappers accused the
volunteers of being on ``the territory of Liberian rebels.''
   The three Westerners were checking water sanitation at border
villages where more than 100,000 people have sought refuge from
fighting between the rebels and troops loyal to President Samuel K.
Doe of Liberia.
   The French and Belgian chapters of Doctors Without Borders had
sent 16 people to the region to vaccinate refugees and assure the
quality of their water supplies to prevent epidemics.
   The rebels have previously captured other Westerners and held
them for several days before releasing them.
   Fighting between the rebels and Liberian troops broke out Dec.
24, and hundreds of rebels and scores of soldiers have been
reported killed.
   The State Department said last week that 380 American officials
and their dependents had left Liberia as rebel forces moved within
striking distance of the capital, Monrovia.

   Several hours into their first full day of
deliberations, jurors deciding the fate of Bensonhurst murder
defendant Keith Mondello asked Wednesday to review Mondello's
signed statement about his admitted involvement in the shooting of
Yusuf Hawkins.
   The jury also asked the trial judge, Justice Thaddeus Owens of
state Supreme Court in brooklyn, to again explain the elements of
the four homicide charges against Mondello.
   Mondello is on trial on two counts of second-degree murder,
first- and second-degree manslaughter and several lesser charges.
   In the three-page statement taken by the police and signed by
Mondello on the day after the shooting, he admits organizing the
mob, knowing that at least one person had a gun and carrying a
baseball bat when Hawkins was shot.
   Defense lawyer Stephen Murphy said the police tricked his client
into putting his name on the statement.
   A second jury for the accused shooter, Joseph Fama, began its
second full day of deliberations listening to lengthy readbacks of
the testimony of two prosecution witnesses, Gina Feliciano and
Cindy Hamburger.
   The panel wanted to hear again what the two young women said
Fama was wearing and where he was about the time of the Aug. 23
shooting.
   The two defendants, both white 19-year-olds, would face 25 years
to life in jail if convicted of murdering the black teen-ager.
Moses Stewart, the father of the slain teen, has asked the black
community to react with restraint if the two are acquitted.
   Stewart said Tuesday he personally would be disappointed with
anything short of two murder convictions.
   The Mondello case went to the jury late Tuesday while the Fama
panel began its deliberations Monday evening.
   Testimony lasted nearly three weeks.

<HEAD>NEA Says Federal Education Spending $12 Billion Short</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest teachers union said
Wednesday that the federal government needs to raise education
spending by $12 billion to fully fund key programs.
   In releasing the National Education Association's annual report
on federal education expenditures, the union's president, Keith
Geiger, said he was ``tempted to characterize our national
commitment to education as killing our children with kindness.
   ``We have plenty of kind words for education in our new kinder
and gentler America, but little action to back up these words.''
   The report tracked the decline in the share of the federal
budget going to education since 1980.
   That year, 2.5 percent of the budget went to education. This
year, only 1.7 percent of federal expenditures will go to
education, the report said.
   Geiger urged President Bush and the Congress to ``rethink the
budget priorities of the United States _ and to make education a
top priority in action as well as in rhetoric.''
   Three specific areas lacking in federal support are handicapped,
bilingual and higher education, the report said.
   When the Handicapped Education Act was passed in 1975, the
government promised to provide 40 percent of the excess costs for
educating disabled students. The report said the amount would be
$3,520 of the current $8,800 for each child. Yet the federal
contribution, the NEA said, is $352.
   Bilingual education programs reach only 5.6 percent of those
identified in the 1980s, the report said.
   As for student aid, the NEA said 80 percent of high-ability but
low-income high school graduates went on to college in 1980. Today
that figure has dropped below 70 percent. Part of the reason for
the drop is that the maximum federal student aid package now pays
less than 40 percent of college costs, compared with as much as 80
percent of the costs in 1980.
   The report also said that Head Start programs for low-income
families will serve about 450,000 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds in
1990-91, less than 20 percent of the 2.5 million eligible children.
   Chapter One reading and math programs for disadvantaged students
will serve about 5.3 million children in 1990-91 _ half of the
elementary and secondary students living in poverty.

<HEAD>Biden Says NATO's Nuclear Weapons Strategy ``Obselete''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assocated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations
panel said Wednesday that nuclear weapons are useless as part of a
NATO strategy because of the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and
expected cuts in U.S.-Soviet forces.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told a top Defense Department
official that the mid-summer review by the 16-nation alliance of
NATO strategy should begin with the theory of defending Western
Europe with only conventional forces.
   ``I believe the military mission nuclear weapons previously
served in NATO strategy has become obsolete,'' Biden said.
   There has been a growing belief among NATO diplomats that the
West could safely reduce, if not eliminate entirely, its arsenal of
land-based tactical missiles and artillery in Europe.
   Germany's Gerhard Stoltenberg, arriving in Canada Monday for a
meeting of NATO defense ministers, said it was possible that all
land-based nuclear systems in Europe would be withdrawn.
   ``Of course the requirement is the readiness of the Soviet Union
to withdraw their own systems,'' Stoltenberg told reporters.
   Biden, chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on
European affairs, said he feared that U.S. steps that fail to
reflect the general feeling in Western Europe would force the
United States out.
   ``We must lead in order to remain,'' Biden said. ``What I'm
planning for is the worst-case scenario ... because of our actions
or inactions we lose the support of Western Europe publics for what
you and I both believe is sorely needed for our peace, security and
prosperity.''
   Paul Wolfowitz, undersecretary of defense for policy, said the
Bush administration has shown a willingness to change.
   President Bush announced last week that his administration had
abandoned plans to build a more powerful short-range nuclear
missile and modernize its 155mm nuclear-tipped artillery shell.
   But the president stopped short of proposing elimination of the
nuclear arsenal, saying the ``United States is not going to allow
Europe to become `safe for conventional war.'''
   Wolfowitz said the expected withdrawal of Soviet forces from
Eastern Europe could result in a reduction in the nuclear arsenal.
   ``But our theater nuclear forces will remain critically
important for deterring all forms of aggression, conventional as
well as nuclear,'' the undersecretary said.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, two House members issued a draft
report that contends the United States has focused on the Soviet
threat for 40 years at the expense of preparing for a low-intensity
conflict or mid-intensity battle.
   ``The armed forces of the United States are ill-prepared for the
realities of conventional combat that are likely to confront them
over the next 12 years,'' Reps. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., and John
Rowland, R-Conn., said in a statement.
   The Center for Strategic and International Studies prepared the
report that urges the Defense Department to reexamine its current
strategy.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Ministers Open Talks on Nuclear Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANANASKIS, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers Wednesday
opened their first nuclear strategy session since upheavals in
Eastern Europe caused the unraveling of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   The officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gathered
for two days of talks in the rugged Kananaskis region of the
Canadian Rocky Mountains, site of the 1988 winter Olympic Games.
   The ministers are under pressure to redo their nuclear policy in
response to greatly reduced East-West tensions.
   West German officials said Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
intended to press his counterparts to withdraw quickly all of
NATO's nuclear artillery shells, most of which are deployed in West
Germany.
   Stoltenberg told reporters earlier this week that it was
possible for all land-based nuclear systems to be removed from
Europe.
   But he linked the withdrawals to a Soviet willingness to do the
same. ``It cannot be unilateral,'' he said. ``It must be on both
sides.''
   Any push for a quick, one-sided pullout of nuclear weapons from
Europe would likely be opposed by both the United States and
Britain.
   British officials said they do not favor the so-called ``third
zero,'' military jargon for the elimination of land-based,
short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Discussions about scaling back the West's arsenal of battlefield
nuclear weapons were given fresh impetus last week by President
Bush. He announced the cancellation of plans to build a more
powerful version of the Lance short-range missile and a modernized
155mm nuclear-tipped artillery shell.
   Tactical weapons, most deployed in West Germany, can only hit
targets in the now friendly countries of Eastern Europe.
   As NATO reduces its land-based forces, analysts expect it to put
more emphasis on air-launched nuclear systems. The United States is
developing a tactical air-to-surface missile, known as the TASM,
which would replace gravity bombs.
   American and British officials, though, seem intent on avoiding
any debate on deployment of the new, longer-range missile.
   There is ``a certain feeling not to have the meeting dominated
by TASM,'' said an official, who demanded anonymity.
   West Germany is thought to be reluctant to get into any
discussions about stationing the TASM missile on aircraft on its
soil. The Bonn government, holding sensitive negotiations on its
merger with East Germany, is mindful of Soviet security concerns.
   The West contends it needs nuclear weapons to offset the Warsaw
Pact's overwhelming superiority in tanks and other conventional
arms.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are expected to enter
into negotiations, possibly early next year, on cutting short-range
systems.
   A Dutch newspaper, Het Parool, reported Wednesday that the
United States plans to site 389 new TASM missiles in seven European
NATO nations starting in 1995 if the alliance approves the program.
   The plan provides for TASM sites in West Germany, Britain,
Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, Belgium and Greece. The newspaper
did not say how it had obtained the information.
   At a summit last May, Bush and other alliance leaders agreed
that bargaining on the tactical weapons could not occur until
implementation of an accord reducing tanks, artillery, troops and
other conventional arms in Europe.
   But Bush announced last week an acceleration of the timetable,
saying bargaining could start once agreement was reached.
Negotiators of NATO and the Warsaw Pact are pressing for a deal by
fall.
   The meeting of the Nuclear Planning Group is one of a series of
high-level NATO talks this month and next on the alliance's future
and its need for nuclear and conventional forces.
   The discussions will wind up with a summer summit of Bush and
other alliance leaders.
   All 16 NATO nations, except France, attend the nuclear meetings,
held twice a year. France is a NATO member but does not belong to
the alliance's integrated military structure. Iceland, which has no
armed forces, has observer status.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Administration to Forgive East European Debts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress urged the Bush
administration Wednesday to drop its opposition to forgiving debts
owed by Poland and other Eastern European countries.
   The United States and other Western nations should write off at
least a portion of the debt to help the ailing economies of
countries emerging from four decades of communist rule, lawmakers
said.
   Reps. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, are
sponsoring bills that would provide for some type of reduction of
debt, including proposals to exchange the debt for projects in the
countries that would protect the global environment.
   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford, appearing before a
Banking subcommitee chaired by LaFalce, said the administration was
unwilling to forgive the $3 billion Polish debt, in part because of
the precedent it would set for the $63 billion in foreign debt held
by the United States.
   LaFalce told Mulford that the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe
had to be supported economically by the United States. Leach warned
that a ``certain degree of chaos'' could result if the United
States didn't take the lead in fostering the movement to
free-market economies.
   Similar warnings came from Polish Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz, who called on commercial banks and governments holding
Poland's $41 billion in debt to make concessions that would slash
Poland's debt payments by 80 percent.
   ``We have to show the Polish people that further sacrifices will
bear fruit,'' he told reporters at a briefing Tuesday. ``This is
why we have been requesting very substantial debt reduction.''
   Mulford said foreign governments already had granted Poland a
moratorium that suspended payments on most of its official debt
until March 1991, allowing the country to get its new economic
program under way.
   Foreign governments hold about 80 percent of Poland's debt, with
the other 20 percent owed to commercial banks.
   ``The issue is important, but how to approach it country by
country is extremely complicated,'' Mulford said of the call for
debt forgiveness. ``It is just not practical at this moment.''
   Mulford did say the United States had been lobbying commercial
banks to reach an agreement to reduce Poland's commercial bank
debt, using the guidelines established last year under Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady's debt-reduction plan for Third World
countries.
   Horst Schulman, managing director of the Institute of
International Finance, a bank lobbying group, said commercial banks
were looking for official agencies, such as the new European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, to play a greater role in
supporting Eastern Europe.
   ``Further (commercial) bank lending at this point will have to
be based on confidence that the reform process will be successful
and that countries will again become credit worthy,'' he told the
subcommittee.
   Mulford said the new European bank is expected to have an
American as its No. 2 official, reflecting the fact that the United
States will have 10 percent voting power in the organization, the
largest of any single country.
   Published reports have said that London will be the site for the
new bank, and Jacques Attali, an adviser to French President
Francois Mitterrand, will head it. Mulford said those decisions
will be made at a May 19 meeting.
   Mulford told members of Congress that the United States will
have a commitment of $1.2 billion, but only $350 million will have
to be paid into the bank. The rest will be available if needed,
Mulford said.
   The Soviet Union will be a member of the new bank, raising
questions in Congress over whether U.S. tax dollars would go to
support the Soviet economy.
   Mulford said restrictions written into the bank's charter at the
insistence of the United States will limit the Soviet Union's
borrowing authority for the first three years to the amount it
contributes to the institution.

   Looking for a good deal on a new car?
Freddye ``Action'' Jackson is ready to give you a discount on a
Lincoln or Mercury _ as long as you can prove you're Christian or
Jewish.
   Under Jackson's Christian Members Buyers Plan, Brown
Lincoln-Mercury in Fairfax City offers cars at a discount to
practicing Christians.
   Jews qualify, Jackson said, but Moslems, Hindus, Sikhs and most
other non-Christians would not.
   ``We're a Christian dealership. We sell the Christians cars at
just a little above invoice,'' said Jackson.
   Under the program, Jackson sells Lincolns for $600 over cost and
Mercurys at $250 over cost to those who qualify. Jackson said
pastors can buy Lincolns at $400 over what he pays the factory, and
Mercurys at $150 over cost.
   The dealership also will donate $100 for a Lincoln and $50 for a
Mercury to the church of the qualifying customer's choice, Jackson
said.
   ``Realizing that the church is the most vital unit and
organizaton in society today, it is important that we as Christians
continue to work for the Lord and support the uplifting of his
kingdom,'' Jackson wrote area churches.
   The plan has upset attorney Victor Glasberg, who says the
discounts may violate the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act,
which forbids religious discrimination in credit transactions.
   ``It is not clear to me that one of the benefits which Jesus had
in mind for those who accepted him as a savior was to provide them
with discounted Lincoln or Mercury automobiles,'' Glasberg said in
a letter to the dealership.
   State and local officials said Jackson's buying program does not
appear to violate civil rights laws.
   The laws apply to housing, employment and places of public
accommodation, such as restaurants and movie theaters, but not to
car dealerships, said Bert Rohrer, a spokesman for Virginia
Attorney General Mary Sue Terry.
   Jackson compared the program to the United Buyers Service, which
offers deals to employees of certain companies, and United States
Automobile Association, which is open to military families.
   A spokesman for Lincoln-Mercury, a division of Ford Motor Co. in
Detroit, said the company is aware of the program.
   ``Ford Motor Co. would not structure a program in this manner,
but Freddye Jackson is an independent businessman,'' spokesman John
Spelich said. ``Quite frankly, we don't address this in our sales
agreements with our dealers.''
   Jackson won't discuss his profits or say how many customers have
used the program he created shortly after taking over the
dealership in July 1989.
   He says Ford pegged the dealership among the lowest-ranked
Lincoln-Mercury dealers for customer service in the Washington
area, but since he took over and it became a ``Christian
dealership,'' it has risen to third place.
   Sales people are not allowed to smoke, drink or use profanity in
the showroom and are encouraged to attend church, Jackson said.
   ``Christ being here made the difference,'' he said.

<HEAD>Brazil's President Wants to Fire 400,000 Federal Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de Mello said
Wednesday he wants to fire up to 400,000 public employees to speed
his drastic economic reform program.
   ``We're about to complete two months in office. In a short
amount of time we've done a lot, but now we need to do more, and
faster,'' Collor, 40, said during a morning meeting with his
Cabinet ministers.
   He also said he wanted to move more quickly on his program to
privatize state companies and slash federal spending to wipe out a
$31 billion deficit.
   Collor announced a package of austerity measures on March 16,
his first full day in office as the country's first freely elected
president in 29 years. They included closing 23 federal companies,
foundations and institutes, and an 18-month freeze on $115 billion
in individual and corporate bank accounts.
   But Collor said Wednesday there was still much to be done to
spur growth in the economy, the largest in Latin America.
   The president, who estimated 1.6 million people work for the
government or for government-controlled firms, ordered his
ministers to reduce personnel by 20 percent to 25 percent.
   The cuts would be made by firings, and by placing excess workers
on what is called ``in availability,'' a Brazilian legal term that
means that civil servants stay at home and draw only partial
salaries. The premise is that eventually they will become disgusted
and quit.
   But Collor did not give a deadline for the layoffs or explain
how he would skirt a constitutional clause that prevents the firing
of any federal employee who has been on the job more than five
years.
   He also said public employee salaries should be ``adequate for
the reality of the national economy, with special attention paid to
intermediate and upper-level pay.'' This was interpreted as a sign
that salaries will be reduced.
   In assessing the initial results of his austerity program, the
president said ``available indicaors show inflation near zero, with
the real value of salaries increased.''
   Before his reforms were put into effect, inflation was racing
along at a rate of 84 percent per month and totaled 4,854 percent
the past 12 months.
   Collor said the long-term success of the plan depended on
reducing Brazil's large state sector.
   His critics have complained his measures, especially the bank
freeze, had a severe impact on the private sector. Meanwhile, they
say, he has barely acted on his promise to reduce the size of the
federal government by cutting spending, privatizing firms and
firing public workers.
   Collor's announcement that he intended to fire 320,000 to
400,000 government employees was seen partly as a response to the
critics.
   The economic slowdown caused by Collor's measures has led to the
firing of an estimated 300,000 people in the private sector.
   Economist Julian Chacel of the prestigious Getulio Vargas
Foundation said recently that firing public employees ``would be
like lighting a match in a gunpowder depot.''
   But on Wednesday he repeated his promise to privatize many of
Brazil's 188 state-run companies, many of which lose money and
together have a debt of $62 billion. Many also serve as job havens
for friends and relatives of politicians and appointees.
   Brazil's Congress has authorized the privatization of almost all
state companies, with the exception of the oil monopoly Petrobras,
the postal service, the telecommunication giant Embratel and some
banks.
   Foreign capital will be allowed to buy 49 percent of capital
shares in the privatized firms but hold only 33 percent of voting
shares.

<HEAD>Aspin Doubts Cheney's Assessment of Soviet Military Intentions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee said Wednesday he doubts that the Soviet Union, faced
with a faltering economy, can upgrade its strategic weapons, as
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has predicted.
   ``Bad news for the Soviet economy is good news for American
security,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., as he called for delaying
the Pentagon's plans to move full speed ahead in modernizing U.S.
strategic weapons.
   Cheney acknowledges the major changes in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, but contends that Moscow is upgrading its strategic
forces at a rate that has not been affected by the rapid
developments overseas.
   The Pentagon chief, responding to budgetary pressures, has
revised the Pentagon's plans for buying the B-2 stealth bomber and
other sophisticated aircraft. Cheney has said, however, that this
is not the time to abandon U.S. development of strategic weapons.
   In a speech to the Overseas Education Fund, Aspin said Cheney is
the most pessimistic of President Bush's advisers on the issue of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chances for survival.
   Aspin noted the public dispute between Cheney, who believes a
Soviet hard liner opposed to U.S. overtures could succeed
Gorbachev, and CIA Director William Webster, who has told Congress
that the real threat to the Soviet president is from reformers.
   The Wisconsin Democrat said the Central Intelligence Agency's
report on the Soviet economy said its performance in 1989 was
abysmal. Soviet economists said the CIA was too optimistic.
   ``I listen to what the intelligence services say about the state
of the Soviet economy and don't see how Moscow can spend the
billions of rubles on defense that Cheney says they will,'' Aspin
said.
   In addition, Soviet engineers, scientists and other technical
people are in short supply, Aspin said.
   ``I think it is possible we will see cutbacks in areas _ such as
air defenses, aircraft carriers and even strategic forces _ that
will be significant and add another element of irreversibility to
the declining Soviet threat,'' Aspin said.

<HEAD>Military Charges Filed Against Bisexual Colonel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army colonel who dressed as a
drag queen to perform at a gay bar has been charged with conduct
unbecoming an officer. Three other officers face similar charges
for homosexual activities.
   Col. Edward L. Modesto, 42, a dental surgeon at Fort Carson, was
accused of engaging in homosexual acts and indecent exposure for
dressing in a wig and women's clothes and exposing himself to
customers at a laundromat.
   A hearing will be held May 31 to determine if Modesto should be
court-martialed, said Fort Carson spokesman Mike Howard.
   Modesto, a self-professed bisexual, denied the indecency charges
Tuesday.
   ``I think they're trying to make an example of me and I don't
know why. I know that I'm an excellent oral surgeon. My military
career is excellent,'' Modesto said.
   Court documents filed last month show that Modesto performed as
``Carmen'' at benefit shows at the Hide N' Seek Club in Colorado
Springs, where he dressed in wigs and sequined gowns and
lip-synched Bette Midler songs.
   But Modesto said that he performed as part of a benefit for AIDS
patients and that he felt it was not unbecoming behavior.
   Homosexual acts are prohibited by military regulations, and some
groups are working to get that regulation changed.
   ``We feel that the regulation common to all of the services that
homosexuality is incompatible with military service is inane and
without a rational foundation,'' said Charles Bumer, attorney with
the Military Law Task Force of the National Lawyers Guild.
   ``This is plain, old-fashioned homophobia and in our society
should not be tolerated,'' said task force co-chairwoman Kathy
Gilberd. ``Thousands of lesbians and gays serve honorably in the
military with considerable bravery.''
   The Modesto investigation began in March, after another officer
was arrested for homosexual activity and identified other
homosexuals at Fort Carson, including Modesto. Three other soldiers
have been charged and others are being investigated, Howard said.
   Modesto said investigators took the informant to gay bars in
Colorado Springs. They used him to point out other military
officers, with whom the investigators would strike up a
conversation, he said.
   ``I feel it's a type of entrapment, to try to engage you in a
conversation just to find out if you are gay,'' he said. ``I feel
that's wrong.
   ``I don't think it was done for any other reason except to
humiliate me,'' he said.
   Modesto has been removed from patient care but still is working
at the army hospital, Howard said.
   If convicted of all charges, Modesto could face 74 years in
prison, fines, dishonorable discharge and lose pay and benefits.
   After nearly 18 years in the military, Modesto was just over two
years from retirement when he was arrested.
   ``There's a big inequity here. Most of the (gay) enlisted people
are being allowed to resign,'' he said. He added that all he wants
now is a discharge ``because that would allow me to continue my
profession and go on with my life.''

<HEAD>Hungarian Party Asks for Nation's Removal from Warsaw Pact</HEAD>

   In an effort to loosen ties to the East
bloc, Hungary's second-largest political party on Wednesday asked
the government to declare its intention to leave the Warsaw Pact
and become a militarily neutral nation.
   The League of Free Democrats, in making its proposal to
Parliament, cited a 1956 government statement that annulled
Hungary's membership in the Soviet-led bloc. The statement prompted
a Soviet invasion that crushed the rebellion.
   Deputy Parliament Speaker Matyas Szueroes said the proposal
would be discussed at the lawmaking body's next session.
   Until now, Hungary's leadership has pledged that it would remain
in the Soviet-led alliance, although individual leaders have
repeatedly suggested the country could one day become neutral.
   The Free Democrats' proposal said Hungary should make clear that
it does not wish to belong to either the Warsaw Pact or the Western
military alliance NATO.
   The party, which won the second-largest number of seats in
Parliament in April elections, proposed the new declaration on the
basis of the 1956 statement.
   The proposal was presented by Miklos Vasarhelyi, an associate of
Imre Nagy, the leader of the 1956 uprising. Vasarhelyi, who was
imprisoned following the uprising, helped draft the declaration.
   Three days after Hungary declared its withdrawal from the
alliance, Soviet troops and tanks rolled into Budapest to crush the
revolt. Nagy was executed following a show trial.
   Kremlin troops have remained in Hungary since then. Now, with
the country's transition to democracy, Hungary has negotiated the
complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from her territory by the
middle of next year.
   The new Parliament would like to see the accord, negotiated by
the outgoing Socialist government, re-negotiated to speed the
pullout. A special subcommittee of the foreign relations committee
in Parliament is to deal specifically with this issue.
   Vasarhelyi made clear the proposal does not call for Hungary's
immediate withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact but opens negotiations on
the topic with Moscow.
   He said if the proposal is adopted, however, Hungary should
suspend all activity in the East bloc alliance and forbid Warsaw
Pact exercises on Hungarian soil.
   The new Parliament is no longer dominated by Communists or their
successors, the Socialists. In free balloting in March and April,
the Socialist Party gained only 33 of the 394 parliamentary seats.
   Jozsef Antall, the leader of the center-right Hungarian
Democratic Forum, which has the most seats in Parliament, is trying
to form a new government with the like-minded Independent
Smallholders and the Christian Democrats.
   Antall told Parliament he expected to present his new government
and its program May 22.
   The Free Democrats campaigned on a platform of swift transfer to
a free market economy, while the Hungarian Democratic Forum
emphasized the need to avoid social disruption and generally
emphasizes conservative, traditional values.

<HEAD>Banker Testifies About Khashoggi's Ownership Claim of Building</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Adnan Khashoggi claimed ownership of
a Wall Street building, allegedly bought by Ferdinand and Imelda
Marcos, several months after a court order froze the Marcoses'
assets, a banker said Wednesday.
   John Sanderson, a Citibank vice president, testified that the
representation was made by a Khashoggi associate during a
discussion in the summer of 1986 about a $39 million Citibank loan
that had been secured by the building.
   Sanderson's testimony addressed the prosecution's allegations
that Khashoggi assumed ownership of four New York buildings held by
the Marcoses after a March 1986 injunction prohibited any transfer
of their properties.
   Khashoggi, a Saudi financier who is charged with mail fraud and
obstruction of justice, is on trial in federal court with Mrs.
Marcos.
   She is accused of helping her husband, the late Philippines
president, loot their nation's treasury of more than $220 million,
using the money to support lavish living and to secretly buy the
four buildings.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, also is charged with defrauding banks of more
than $165 million in loans, including the Citibank loan, to finance
the real estate.
   She has pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering,
racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Sanderson said his initial dealings concerning the loan were
with Gliceria Tantoco, a close friend of Mrs. Marcos. Mrs. Tantoco,
owner of a department store in Manila, also was charged in the
indictment but is a fugitive.
   Sanderson testified that he had at least two meetings with Mrs.
Tantoco in 1984 and 1985 about problems with the Wall Street
building's management.
   In July 1986, he learned that the management company was $2
million behind in city real estate taxes and became concerned
because any city claim would come before Citibank's, Sanderson said.
   A short time later, he got a call from a Karl Peterson, who told
him he was working for Khashoggi and said Khashoggi was the
building's owner.
   Sanderson said the loan agreement had prohibited any transfer of
the property without the bank's written consent.
   The bank started foreclosure on the loan in the fall of 1986
because a substantial amount of interest and real estate taxes were
not paid and required rehabilitation of the building was not
undertaken, Sanderson said.
   He left the account in the summer of 1988, but said he believed
Citibank did win a judgment and recover its money.
   Mrs. Marcos, who fell ill Tuesday with high blood pressure for a
second time, returned to court Wednesday wearing a monitor.
   ``She's feeling better today,'' her attorney, Gerry Spence, said
after the morning testimony.

<TEXT>
   At the height of violence that rocked
South Korea's capital Wednesday, a young woman with a ponytail
ducked into a doorway with a makeshift medical bag to aid a student
bleeding from the head.
   The thunder of volleys of police tear gas shells shook the
ground. Clouds of acrid gas billowed along the street in front of
her like great balls of fog. Nearby students gagged or vomited.
   The girl carefully wrapped the young man's head with bandages
and gave him a hug.
   Moments before, the young man had been hurling firebombs at a
U.S. diplomatic building and yelling ``Yankee go home!'' His
friends later forced riot policemen to kneel, and then they beat
them.
   The two, both radical students, are among the elite of South
Korea's young, those able to gain admittance to universities. They
are the pride of a country that equates education with prosperity.
Yet they are a deep embarrassment in a society that values harmony.
   Most of the radical students claim they are serving their
country. The country's government says most of them are naive
leftists who have been brainwashed by Communist North Korean
teachings. Some of them, the government has said, may be Communist
agents.
   Who are these students and what do they want?
   Radicals wear American jeans and sneakers, carry their books in
a backpack and look like college students everywhere. They go to
some of the best schools in South Korea.
   Radical students number only about 5 percent of the roughly 1
million students in college. Other students listen to their
rallies, read their newspapers or may agree with some of their
views, but they do not usually participate.
   Radicals are demanding more democratic reforms from a government
they claim has been too slow to do so. They view the January merger
of the governing party with two opposition parties as a political
coup intended to prolong a hold on power without an election.
   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' they shout. Many feel an
overthrow of the government could solve the country's problems but
offer few details on how a new leader could do better.
   Radicals claim Washington makes decisions for a Seoul puppet
government. They demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops based
in South Korea because they say their presence hinders unification
talks with North Korea.
   None of them are old enough to remember the bloody 1950-53
Korean War, launched by North Korea, the war in which 5 million
Americans served. Some of them say they have never talked to an
American.
   At protests, women collect rocks, wave banners, tend to injuries
and sing support songs. Men deployed in platoon fashion hurl
firebombs and rocks.
   The radical student movement lost momentum after Roh took office
in February 1988 promising broad democratic reforms. The smaller
numbers forced radicals to become more violent to be noticed. Some
began to use homemade explosives.
   The government privately worries the violent protests could
breed discontent among older South Koreans, especially laborers who
often feel underprivileged and underpaid.
   With escalating prices and double-digit inflation, Roh's
government has declined in popularity and it's mindful of
student-worker alliances that have wrought change in the past.
   In 1960, hundreds of thousands of students took to the streets
to demand the fall of President Syngman Rhee regime. In 1987,
hundreds of thousands of students spurred an authoritarian former
president, Chun Doo-hwan, to make reforms. Discontented workers
joined those protests.
   ``In Korea, protests are a statement,'' the president of a Seoul
university said on condition of anonymity. ``Eventually the country
may mature enough not to have to make the statement with violence.
It's embarrassing.''

   A puzzling breakdown in Columbia's
cooling system has forced NASA to delay next week's scheduled
shuttle launch by an estimated two to three weeks, the space agency
said Wednesday.
   Columbia had been scheduled to lift off May 16 or May 17 with
seven astronauts and the $100 million Astro observatory, capable of
probing ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. But engineers this week
spotted a problem with a valve that controls the flow of coolant in
the shuttle.
   ``We are obviously disappointed that we are not ready to fly,''
said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
``However, this particular system is absolutely critical to the
safety of the crew and overall mission success, so we have decided
to change the component.''
   NASA had hoped to confirm a launch date at the end of the
two-day Flight Readiness Review meeting on Wednesday afternoon, but
that did not occur. Mission managers agreed an apparently faulty
valve would have to be replaced and that the work could be done at
the launch pad.
   ``They don't understand the problem enough to feel comfortable
flying with it, so they've got to go in and fix it,'' said Bascom
Murrah, a NASA official in charge of prelaunch operations for
Columbia.
   ``We feel we can do that at the pad, but how long that will take
I really would only be guessing.''
   Launch teams expect to have a better idea by early next week as
to how long the job will take, NASA said in a statement. The agency
has never replaced a cooling valve at the launch pad.
   Returning Columbia to its hangar for the valve to be replaced
would have resulted in a considerably longer delay.
   NASA said mission managers ``decided that completing the
replacement and checkout on the pad is as safe and effective'' as
performing the work in the shuttle's hangar.
   Engineers noticed the problem Sunday when there was an
unexplained change in the flow of coolant.
   The valve is in one of Columbia's two Freon cooling loops
beneath the payload bay liners. It controls the proportion and rate
of Freon distributed between the crew cabin heat exchanger and the
cooling system for payloads.
   Columbia's nine- to 10-day flight will be the 36th shuttle
mission, provided it goes before an Atlantis mission in July. It
also will be the first Spacelab mission since 1985.

   Firefighters aided by cool, damp weather
gained the upper hand Wednesday over two forest fires that
blackened more than 12 square miles of dry woods and grasslands and
destroyed 75 homes.
   Up to 300 people were evacuated from their homes, most of them
along the Au Sable River, after the fires broke out Tuesday in a
sparsely populated section of the northern Lower Peninsula,
authorities said.
   The only known casualty was a firefighter treated for smoke
inhalation, said Scott Heather, assistant regional forest manager
with the state Department of Natural Resources.
   The larger fire began five miles east of Grayling. Fanned by
20-mph gusts, it burned an 8-by-1{-mile swath of woods and
grassland and destroyed 66 houses and more than 30 other structures
such as shacks and garages, Heather said.
   ``We feel at this point we've got the fire 75 percent
controlled,'' he said. ``The weather conditions are with us; it's
cool and damp. We don't anticipate any further problem.''
   Flames persisted in a mainly marshy area, where it was difficult
to bring in firefighting equipment, Heather said.
   The second fire broke out 10 miles to the south, in southern
Crawford and northern Roscommon counties.
   It consumed 450 acres and nine homes and five other structures
before being brought under control early Wednesday with help from a
quarter-inch of rain that fell overnight, Heather said.
   Light rain continued Wednesday as four National Guard
helicopters dumped 185-gallon buckets of water on flames.
   About 30 evacuees spent Tuesday night at nearby Camp Grayling, a
Michigan National Guard base. About 100 turned up at a Red Cross
center Wednesday to obtain warm clothing and instructions for
seeking financial help.
   ``This one little old lady in particular struck me,'' said
Crawford County Sheriff's Deputy Heide Miller, who was meeting
evacuees at the door. ``She had apparently got word her house was
gone. She was in shock.''
   The cause of the fires remained under investigation, Heather
said. Other Department of Natural Resources officials said they
suspected a trash fire had gotten out of hand.
   Most of the northern Lower Peninsula went 13 days without any
rain and longer than that without a heavy downpour, said
meteorologist Chuck Defever of the National Weather Service's Ann
Arbor office. In addition, snow melted early this year, allowing
undergrowth to become very dry.
   Gov. James Blanchard and department Director David Hales arrived
to survey the damage.
   Up to 150 department and local firefighters battled the blazes
at their peak late Tuesday, but only about 75 remained Wednesday
afternoon, Heather said.
   Miller said most residents would find out Wednesday evening
whether their homes were among the few saved, when firefighters
expected to remove road barricades.
   ``There will be a lot of broken hearts,'' said Bill Mahalak,
acting regional forest manager with the Department of Natural
Resources.
   The area's year-round population is relatively sparse, but grows
when cabin owners visit for the summer and fall, drawn by deer or
bear hunting and trout fishing along the Au Sable River.
   Norbert Szkotnicki said he snuck past police barricades to check
on his home along the river. He found part of it burning.
   ``I got a chain saw and cut off a (burning) corner of the
cabin,'' he said. Firefighters then arrived and doused the house,
saving it.
   ``My family has been here 110 years. My grandfather built that
house,'' he said. ``I wasn't going to lose it.''

<TEXT>
   Record floods that are saturating
hundreds of houses are striking at people who often don't have
flood insurance, a state official says. Some can't get it, some
can't afford it, and some don't bother.
   Flood insurance is a hot topic while the Arkansas River is
slopped over its banks. The river crested Tuesday to a record level
at Little Rock and was expected reach 48 feet Wednesday at Pine
Bluff _ a foot above flood stage.
   F.A. Crockett wishes he hadn't let his flood insurance policies
lapse a few years ago. He says he can't recall getting a renewal
notice for his flood insurance and assumed he no longer needed it.
   ``I went along for years and didn't think nothing about it,''
said the 72-year-old Crockett, who owns a used car dealership. ``I
don't know much about insurance except that I pay the premium.''
   Now water is waist deep or higher in five houses he owns.
   Statewide, about 500 homes are under water, between 250 and 300
of them in Jefferson County, official said. Corps of Engineers
spokesman P.J. Spaul put early estimates of flood damage at $15
million to $20 million statewide.
   The damage to agriculture is not yet tallied. Cattlemen say
hundreds of cattle have drowned or are trapped by flood waters; the
spring wheat crop is lost in some counties, and flooded fields
further delay spring rice planting.
   Jefferson County probably will lose one-sixth of its $60 million
annual agricultural sales, said Frank Plafcan of the county
extension office.
   A federal disaster declaration for Arkansas' flooded counties
could come later this week, civil defense officials said.
   In Texas, where flooding and heavy rains have claimed 12 lives
in the last two weeks and President Bush declared disaster areas in
16 counties, the Red Cross estimates that 4,000 homes have been
damaged or destroyed by flooding.
   Officials in Texas say the first federal disaster relief checks
are being handed out in 1,383 requests for help the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has received since May 2.
   Arkansas officials say they don't know how many flood victims
have no flood insurance, only how many Arkansans have it. ``It is
low, I know that,'' said Alison McCollum of the state Soil and
Water Conservation Commission.
   As of March 31, there were 7,628 flood insurance policies in
Arkansas, paying premiums that totaled $1,687,926, said FEMA
official Greg Solovey.
   Solovey said 337 areas in Arkansas participate in the federal
insurance program. But some areas along the Arkansas River aren't
in the program, and property owners in those areas must absorb any
losses due to flood damage.
   Ms. McCollum said people ignore the need for flood insurance
because they think it's expensive. But it's not as expensive as
people think, she added.
   ``Flood insurance costs are not astronomical,'' she said.
``People should check, because I know it gets out that you just
can't afford it. If people don't live in a designated flood plain
they can get very good rates.''
   Wanda Irving, who was forced by rising water to leave her home
here, said she had to get flood insurance to finance her house. She
pays $119 a year to insure the house and its contents, she said.
   Tina Mullins, a sales representative, said flood insurance rates
vary but generally are inexpensive. In North Little Rock, a premium
of $100 a year will buy $40,500 worth of coverage on a house and
$1,000 on contents.
   The federal government underwrites all flood insurance programs,
and only those who live in cities, towns or counties that
participate in the government's National Flood Insurance Program
can obtain flood insurance.
   To join a flood program, a city or community must agree to
certain land management goals.
   ``In other words, stop the shopping centers from building in a
flood zone area, stop the developers from putting in a residential
area where it's going to flood,'' said Bill Starkey of the
Independent Insurance Agents of Arkansas.
   The federal government subsidizes flood insurance to restrict
building in flood plains and because flood insurance never can pay
for itself, he said.
   ``The people on the mountain top don't buy it. Only the ones
next to the river,'' Starkey said.

   President Bush said Wednesday he will nominate
Raymond Philip Laverty as deputy administrator of the Panama Canal.
   Laverty, a longtime canal official who is acting deputy
administrator for operations, would succeed Fernando Manfredo. A
native of Brocton, Mass., the 59-year-old Laverty is a graduate of
the University of Notre Dame.
   Bush announced last week during the White House visit of
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara that he was nominating
Gilberto Guardia Fabrega as administrator.
   The 60-year-old Panamanian is president of an architectural and
engineering company in Panama City. Educated at Santa Clara
University in California, Guardia was a civil engineer with the
Panama Canal Co. in the 1950s.
   The canal treaties call for a Panamanian _ selected by Panama,
nominated by the U.S. president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate _
to be put in charge of the canal in the final decade of U.S.
jurisdiction.
   The canal will be turned over to Panama in 2000.
   Last year, Bush balked at Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga's choice
for canal administrator and refused to send a name to the Senate.

<HEAD>Attacked Colleague Gratified By Jimmy Breslin's Two-Week
Suspension</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with commen from Breslin's wife</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Newsday turned a reprimand into a suspension for
Jimmy Breslin after the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist went on a
radio show and spoke flippantly about his racial and sexual tirade
against another reporter.
   Don Forst, the editor of New York Newsday, announced the
two-week suspension without pay late Tuesday.
   Ji-Yeon Yuh, a Korean-American reporter who was the target of
the columnist's epithets, said Wednesday the punishment was
appropriate.
   ``I think Newsday did the right thing,'' Yuh said from her desk
at the newspaper's office in Queens. ``I think when these kinds of
things happen you really need to send a strong message that it is
completely unacceptable.''
   Asian-American staffers who had told management that the
reprimand and Breslin's apology were not enough called off a
planned byline strike.
   Calls to Breslin's apartment Wednesday for comment were met with
busy signals.
   Forst's announcement of the suspension said the newspaper had
believed Breslin's apology in response to its reprimand of his
conduct had been genuine and sincere.
   ``But his radio conversation Tuesday morning with Howard Stern
indicates a lack of sensitivity to what has been and continues to
be a painful episode for all of us,'' he said.
   Stern is a talk-show host who has tangled with the Federal
Communications Commission over his sexual and ethnic jokes.
   Breslin, 61, telephoned Stern while he was on the air and
bantered about what may occur when he attends the approaching
wedding of his nephew to a Korean woman. Breslin said he called the
program at the urging of his children because Stern was devoting
much of his show to the controversy.
   ``I think that even without the Howard Stern show, he should
have been suspended,'' Yuh said.
   The brouhaha was touched off when Yuh criticized as sexist a
column Breslin wrote last week complaining that women officials _
especially his wife, a member of the New York City Council _ didn't
spend enough time at home.
   Yuh delivered her comments to Breslin the following day via
interoffice computer memo. Breslin roared his response to other
Newsday staffers in the Manhattan office, describing Yuh, who was
not present, with an obscenity and calling her ``yellow cur'' and
``slant-eyed.''
   Later Friday afternoon, Breslin submitted an apology to
Newsday's staff in an internal computer message in which he said:
``I am no good and once again I can prove it. ... I am sorry. I
said things I shouldn't have said. The racial and sexual insults I
spewed are never appropriate.''
   He apologized again in his column on Monday.
   After meeting with protesting staffers Tuesday evening and
saying they did not intend to go beyond rebuking Breslin, the
newspaper's editors listened to a tape of the columnist on Stern's
program and decided to suspend him.
   Breslin's wife, Ronnie M. Eldridge, issued a statement Wednesday
defending him and saying he is neither racist nor sexist.
   ``He is an artist. He has written fine books and memorable
columns. His view of the world is special and consistent and
wonderful,'' she said. ``But he is also outrageous. And he has a
quick and miserable temper. He lost it the other day. And said
terrible and regrettable things. Sadly, for him, he found no
compassion or forgiveness.''
   His comments on the radio show, she said, were ``a poor attempt
at humor.''

   Record cold and snow spread along the northern Rockies, western
Plains and Great Lakes on Wednesday and rain extended across the
Plains and the Southeast.
   The calendar reads May, but Great Falls, Mont., hit a record low
of 24; Helena, Mont., had a record low of 25, and Laramie, Wyo.,
hit a record low of 16. Grand Junction, Colo., tied its record of
33.
   The low of 13 at Rawlins, Wyo., was the city's lowest May
temperature since 1951, and was also Wednesday's low for the Lower
48 states, the National Weather Service said.
   Higher elevations of Colorado had snow showers and snow was
mixed with rain over western Kansas during the morning.
   Snow also fell at higher elevations of Wyoming, and over
sections of Upper Michigan. Rain was mixed with snow over northern
Wisconsin.
   Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming got 14 inches
of snow from the storm late Monday and through Tuesday. The Big
Horn Mountains got 10 inches.
   Early Wednesday, fog, heavy snow and blustery wind cut
visibility in Cheyenne and Laramie, Wyo., to one-half mile, the
weather service said. Northwesterly wind of 15 to 30 mph created
biting wind chills near zero, the agency reported.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from central and
north-central Kansas across eastern Nebraska, Iowa, southern
Minnesota, Wisconsin, northern Lower Michigan, northern Illinois,
and from northeastern through west-central Missouri.
   Strong thunderstorms during the morning produced locally heavy
rain, including 1.53 inches at La Crosse, Wis.
   Intense thunderstorms swept through Iowa, dumping more than an
inch of rain in the northwest and in a 70- to 80-mile wide band
stretching from Council Bluffs in the southwest to Dubuque in the
northeast.
   A school bus carrying 25 children tipped over on a wet, muddy
road in southeastern Iowa but no serious injuries were reported,
police said.
   Showers and storms also reached from Tennessee across western
and central North Carolina, western South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama and eastern Mississippi.
   Light rain was scattered over southwestern Arkansas and
east-central North Dakota.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.79 inches at Mobile, Ala.; 1.38 inches at Mary Esther, Fla.; 1.24
inches at Rochester, Minn.; 1.12 inches at Eau Clair, Wis.; and
1.06 inches at Milton, Fla.
   Early morning thunderstorms in Kansas produced
three-quarter-inch diameter hail in Kansas near Scandia and
Washington, and golfball-size hail with wind gusting to near 60 mph
at Concordia.
   Flooding continued in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   The Arkansas River had begun to recede slowly at Little Rock and
was cresting at Pine Bluff. Extensive flooding continued along the
river, and other streams in eastern Arkansas also were out of their
banks.
   In Texas, the flood crest on the Trinity River was near
Crockett, almost halfway across Texas on its way from the Dallas
area to the Gulf of Mexico.
   Urban flooding was a threat in Puerto Rico after locally heavy
rain fell during the morning on an area around San Juan that was
well soaked by rain on Tuesday. The Rio Culebrinas was out of its
banks by late morning.
   Port Arthur, Texas, got 2.42 inches of rain Tuesday, bringing
the city's total for May to 6.89 inches and for the year to date to
33.83 inches.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32 at
Marquette, Mich., to 94 at Laredo, Texas.

<HEAD>White House Says NATO Summit Likely in Early July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House indicated Wednesday that a
NATO summit meeting, called by President Bush, probably will be
held in the first week of July.
   The meeting, expected to be in London, apparently will be
squeezed in between a six-day Bush vacation in Kennebunkport,
Maine, and a summit session
   in Houston of leaders of the world's seven largest economic
powers.
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said that
dates for the NATO summit had not been set but that a number of
allies had expressed a preference for early July.
   Popadiuk said NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner has been
quoted as mentioning July 5-6 or July 6-7 as likely dates.
   Bush said last week that leaders of the 16 NATO nations should
meet to develop new military and political strategies ``for the
transformed Europe of the 1990s.'' The only timing he mentioned was
late June or early July.
   In the first of three summer summits, Bush will meet in
Washington with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev from May 30
to June 3. On June 29, Bush is expected to travel to his seaside
home at Kennebunkport.
   If the July 5 opening of the NATO summit holds, Bush would fly
to London from Kennebunkport on Independence Day. Tentative plans
call for Bush to return to Washington on the evening of July 6 and
then leave the next day for Houston, where he will host the
seven-nation economic summit July 9-11.

   Aerospace companies from Britain and France said
Wednesday they have begun a $34 million study to determine whether
to develop a new supersonic airliner to replace their jointly
produced Concorde.
   The decision on whether to proceed with a $10 billion production
program would be made in 1995, said Aerospatiale President Henri
Martre, whose company is working with British Aerospace.
   Martre told a news conference that the companies would welcome
U.S., Soviet West German or Japanese cooperation.
   British Airways and Air France operate 13 Concordes on
trans-Atlantic routes. The jetliners are due for retirement in 15
to 20 years, and the new planes _ if developed _ would be ready by
about 2005.
   The new generation of supersonic transport could carry about 225
passengers over distances of up to 7,500 miles at 2{ times the
speed of sound, aviation experts say.
   The present Concorde carries 128 passengers on flights of up to
3,720 miles at twice the speed of sound.
   The projected aircraft would be capable of nonstop flights
across the Pacific.

<HEAD>Luxembourg Envoy to NATO Quits after Security Breach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Luxembourg's envoy to NATO has quit after he
committed a minor security infraction, Foreign Minister Jacques
Poos said Wednesday.
   He told Parliament that Guy de Muyser, 64, resigned on April 25
after the government learned he ``had breached security rules'' at
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Indicating the infraction was minor, Poos said de Muyser will
remain envoy to Belgium.
   Luxembourg traditionally combines the two Brussels
ambassadorships.
   Sources said the security breach stemmed from trips de Muyser
made to the Soviet Union where he gave out NATO documents whose
contents had already been publicly reported.
   On April 25, the government, citing ``preventive reasons,''
withdrew de Muyser's security clearance denying him access to
secret NATO papers and effectively forcing his resignation that
same day.
   The sources spoke on the condition of not being identified.
   Officials at NATO headquarters declined to comment on the case.
   De Muyser became NATO ambassador in 1986. He was envoy to the
Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983. During the 1970s, he held senior
positions at the Palace of Grand Duke Jean, Luxembourg's monarch.
   De Muyser was not available for comment Wednesday. A man
answering the phone at his Brussels residence said the envoy was
vacationing in France.
   Last month, a staff member at NATO's West German mission was
arrested on charges of spying for East Germany and the Soviet Union.

   The government's top telephone regulator said
Wednesday he can still control the huge regional Bell telephone
companies if they are allowed to design and manufacture telephone
equipment.
   But Bell rivals and consumer representatives told a Senate
hearing they were concerned that unfettered Bell companies could
use their enormous earnings power to drive out competition and
subsidize new business ventures with their monopoly local telephone
earnings.
   A bill by the committee chairman, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings,
D-S.C., would lift manufacturing restrictions imposed on the seven
regional Bell companies by the so-called Modification of Final
Judgment, which ended the AT&amp;T antitrust suit in 1984.
   The Hollings bill would allow the Bell companies to design,
develop and fabricate telecommunications equipment, including
network and customer premises equipment. It also would require that
such activities take place in the United States.

<HEAD>Justice Department Refers Fauntroy Allegations to Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has referred to the
House ethics committee allegations that Del. Walter Fauntroy,
D-D.C., hired a colleague's son for a no-show job, officials said
Wednesday.
   The department decided recently not to bring criminal charges
against Fauntroy following a 15-month investigation.
   Spokesman David Runkel said ``there was information that the
House ethics committee might want to look at.'' He declined to give
further details.
   Fauntroy, the district's non-voting delegate in Congress, was
investigated for his employment of the son of Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill.
   Runkel said a parallel Justice Department investigation of
Savage had also been closed for lack of evidence to warrant
prosecution, and that matter also was referred to the House ethics
committee.
   The department examined whether the elder Savage was aware of
any possible wrongdoing in Fauntroy's hiring of his son, said
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fauntroy, who has denied any wrongdoing throughout the
investigation, said in a statement Tuesday, ``There are no new
facts for the ethics committee to find.''
   Abbe Lowell, Fauntroy's attorney, said the lawmaker had
cooperated fully with the probe.
   Savage did not return phone calls to his office on Wednesday.
   Jan Keyes, a spokeswoman for the House Committee on Standards of
Official Committee _ the formal name of the ethics panel _ had no
comment on whether it would open an investigation.
   The Justice Department investigation began in December 1988,
after The Associated Press reported that Thomas Savage was living
in Chicago and running for election to the Illinois House while on
Fauntroy's payroll in the nation's capital.
   Thomas Savage was on Fauntroy's payroll from September 1987
through June 1988, except for a 10-week unpaid leave, a period when
he said he went to Illinois to run for the legislature.
   House rules require that congressional employees must perform
their duties either in Washington or the member's district.
   Fauntroy is giving up his House seat to run for the Democratic
mayoral nomination.

<TEXT>
   Investigators seized a homemade poisoning
guide, boxloads of chemicals and bondage gear from a man charged
with the 1988 poisonings of his neighbors, according to court
records unsealed Wednesday.
   The property of George James Trepal, 41, who was arrested and
charged last month with first-degree murder, attempted murder and
product tampering, was listed in an item-by-item inventory.
   ``If you believe everything you've heard so far, sure it looks
bad. But when our side is finally heard you'll see the whole
picture,'' said defense attorney Jonathan Stidham, who's called his
client ``a bit of a different person.''
   Prosecutors say Trepal, a computer programmer and Mensa member,
used poison-spiked bottles of Coca-Cola to kill neighbor Peggy Carr
of Alturas and poison her husband and children, leaving two of them
partially paralyzed.
   In the six years before the poisonings, Trepal complained about
the Carr's dogs chasing his cats, loud radios the Carr children
played and the all-terrain vehicles they rode, police said.
   And in the months prior to the October 1988 poisonings, the
Carrs were mailed a typed warning: ``You and all your so-called
family have two weeks to move out of Florida forever or else you
all die. This is no joke.''
   Mrs. Carr lapsed into a coma and died in March 1989. An FBI
analysis of the Coca-Cola showed it was laced with highly toxic
thallium nitrate.
   When questioned in 1988, Trepal said his only knowledge of
thallium came from TV news, according to authorities. But Trepal
was convicted in 1975 and served three years in prison for running
a drug lab in North Carolina that produced $7 million in illegal
methamphetamines. Thallium is used in amphetamine manufacture.
   Bottles of the poison found in the garage of Trepal's Alturas
home late last year led to his arrest and further searches,
according to court documents.
   Among the things seized from Trepal's home in Sebring, where he
moved late last year, were boxloads of labeled and unlabeled
chemicals, laboratory equipment and a neat, green ledger on
poisoning, according to authorities.
   ``It looked to be a homemade journal with different pages from
different books placed in it. ... It's a very extensive book,''
Polk County Detective Ernie Mincey said during a court hearing last
month.
   Detectives seized hundreds of books in Trepal's home, but listed
one in particular, ``Pale Horse,'' an Agathie Christie murder
mystery in which a chemist kills many people by putting thallium in
makeup, medicine and foods.
   Trepal and his wife, orthopedic surgeon Diana Carr, were members
of Mensa, an organization for people of high intelligence. Diana
Carr is not related to the victims' family and has not been charged.
   In April 1989, Trepal and his wife organized the group's
``Murder Mystery Weekend,'' investigators said.
   A booklet of background material Trepal prepared for the event
detailed a staged voodoo poisoning death. One passage of that
seized book reads: ``When a death threat appears on the doorstep,
prudent people throw out all their food and watch what they eat,''
according to court documents.
   More than 60 books and six videotapes on bondage were also found
in the Sebring home, along with leather bondage tools, the search
warrants showed.
   Detectives testified in detail last month about finding a
soundproof ``torture-type room'' in the basement, complete with a
flat wooden bed and stirrups. ``We believe it was probably used in
bondage,'' Mincey said.
   In addition to the search of the Sebring and Alturas homes,
detectives also searched a mini-warehouse Trepal rented, Diana
Carr's medical office and her airplane, warrants showed.
   ``The prosecution has come out with a lot of evidence,'' defense
lawer Jonathan Stidham said Wednesday. ``It's all very interesting,
but none of it shows my client put thallium in Coke bottles and put
it in these peoples' home.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two auctions of contemporary art featured lower
prices this week, suggesting that the market has stopped its
frenzied climb upward and buyers are becoming more selective, art
experts said Wednesday.
   The experts said the contemporary art market is still healthy
and they did not fear a bust, even though many paintings didn't
sell or sold well below their estimated prices.
   ``People are more than willing to pay top sums for excellent
pieces of art but are not willing to pay inflated prices for
second-rate works of art,'' said Larry Gagosian, a Madison Avenue
art dealer.
   Roy Lichtenstein's ``Kiss II,'' from 1962, a cartoon image of a
young couple kissing, sold at Christie's auction house in New York
City on Monday for $6 million, the highest price ever paid for a
work by the artist. Its presale estimate was $5 million to $7
million.
   At that same sale, 26 artworks out of 77 offered failed to find
buyers because no bids reached the minimum set by the seller. The
auction house sold $40.17 million worth of art, well below its
presale estimate of $50 million to $71.8 million.
   At rival Sotheby's on Tuesday, 32 artworks out of 87 went
unsold, and the sale brought in $55.9 million against house
expectations of $86.6 million to $112.9 million.
   Still, Cy Twombly's 1971 untitled blackboard painting fetched
$5.5 million, the most ever paid at auction for a work by the
artist.
   ``I think a lot of the hysteria has gone out of the market,''
said Milton Esterow, editor and publisher of ARTnews.
   Allan Stone, a New York dealer, agreed. ``What's been going on
the last couple years has been absolute insanity,'' he said.
   They said selective buying was replacing the buying sprees of
the last several years, but the change doesn't indicate the art
market had hit rocky times.
   ``I think the business will remain very good,'' said Gagosian.
   Some experts, particularly art dealers, have blamed Sotheby's
and Christie's for creating unrealistic price expectations among
consignors who place their art with the auction houses for sale.
   ``The problem, I think, is that too many collectors are too
greedy and the auction houses have not put their feet down strongly
enough in telling collectors that their reserves have no relation
to reality,'' Esterow said.
   Auction houses and sellers agree to a reserve price below which
an artwork cannot be sold. ``It is in our interest to give the
consigner the most accurate estimate we can. It's also in our
interest to make sure the painting sells,'' Nash said.
   David Nash, senior vice president in charge of fine arts at
Sotheby's, said, ``There was something of a rather frenzied and
heated atmosphere over the last several years which we knew could
not be sustained.''
   ``We sort of had the feeling you could sell almost anything
regardless of price, and we knew this was not an ideal place for
the market to be in.''
   Nash said the turnover for the auction house's contemporary art
department in 1984 was $13 million, compared to $250 million in
1989. During the last three years, prices of artworks were doubling
every six months, he said.
   He called the change in the market ``a healthy development.''
   Christopher Burge, president of Christie's, said contemporary
art prices had been pushed to their limit in recent several years.

<TEXT>
   In the race to become the champions of
big breakfasts, civic-minded chefs in western Massachusetts have
stirred oceans of batter, flipped mountains of pancakes and brewed
rivers of coffee.
   Rival Battle Creek, Mich., has served up cereal, Pop Tarts,
doughnut holes and Tang _ cold.
   ``We're not talking apples and apples and oranges and oranges,''
says state Rep. Athan Catjakis, a co-chairman of this Saturday's
breakfast in Springfield.
   Officials hope to dish up 35,000 pancake breakfasts to hang on
to the biggest breakfast title, wrested from Battle Creek last year
by a margin of about 1,000 breakfasts served. Battle Creek answers
the challenge June 9.
   Springfield, Ore., which tried and failed to beat its
Massachusetts namesake in 1989, will send Mayor William E.
Morisette and his wife to pick up pointers, although no immediate
challenge is planned.
   ``As far as a pancake breakfast, I don't think there's anybody
in the United States that can touch us,'' Catjakis said. ``It's a
lot easier to take a box of cereal and pour some milk.''
   Officials in Battle Creek, home of three major cereal makers,
defended their menu. ``Is it fair? You bet,'' said spokeswoman
Helen Royal.
   She said Battle Creek, with a population of about 70,000, is at
a disadvantage to Springfield, a city of about 150,000, so the
Michigan city has to work harder to get the big numbers.
   Besides, cereal goes back a long way in Battle Creek, home of
the Kellogg Co., the Post division of General Foods Corp. and
Ralston Purina Co., she said.
   ``We are the cereal capital of the world. That's a title that we
really honor and that we defend and we're the only city in the
world that can claim that right,'' Royal said.
   Battle Creek held a free cereal breakfast in 1956 to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the founding of Kellogg. The event was
repeated four times from 1958 to 1962. The tradition was resumed in
1976.
   A decade later, Springfield set up a table on Main Street and
served 24,000 pancake breakfasts to celebrate its 350th anniversary.
   ``We were looking for something different to do,'' Catjakis said.
   The cities first competed for ``World's Longest Breakfast
Table,'' but after that became logistically difficult, the race
switched to feeding the most people.
   Battle Creek won in 1987 and 1988. But in 1989, Springfield won
with 33,869 breakfasts served. Battle Creek officials blamed a
cold, windy day for only attracting 32,856 people.
   In 1987, Springfield tried serving cereal, but it bombed with
New England breakfast-eaters, Catjakis said.
   The Springfield pancakes, provided by a restaurant chain at
$1.50 per adult, calls for 600 pounds of egg yolks, 220 pounds of
butter, 3,000 pounds of flour and 400 gallons of water. Sixteen
griddles are used and the flapjacks are served with 2,000 pounds of
butter and 200 gallons of maple syrup.
   Six hundred gallons of coffee and orange juice complete the meal.

<HEAD>GSA Chief Says Defense Department Should Pay To Fix Up Pentagon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The acting head of the General Services
Administration said Wednesday the Defense Department _ not the GSA
_ should pay for the $1.1 billion renovation of the Pentagon.
   Richard G. Austin told a House Public Works and Transportation
panel that he supports the transfer of the Pentagon from his
agency's control to the Defense Department, a step expected later
this year.
   Once the transfer takes place, the Defense Department should
handle the expense of repairing the 48-year-old building.
   ``The renovation and modernization of the Pentagon building will
create unique security problems, and the logistical difficulties
inherent in any major renovation will be complicated by the
extremely high sensitivity of the building tenants,'' Austin said.
   The acting GSA administrator also told the subcommittee on
public buildings and grounds that the cost of $1.1 billion over
seven years for the Pentagon repair ``would place a significant
demand for resources on the federal building fund.''
   Earlier this year, Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military construction, said
the Bush administration's request for $1.1 billion to renovate the
Pentagon is ``out of the question.''
   Sasser acknowledged that the building is in need of repair but
said the administration's call for $1.1 billion over seven years
would be difficult to heed in a time of shrinking budgets.
   ``The military construction bill is going to get smaller not
larger,'' Sasser said. ``There's simply no room for such an
undertaking.''
   The Pentagon, the largest office building in the world, has 17.5
miles of corridors, 131 stairways, 19 escalators and 13 elevators,
and covers 29 acres in northern Virginia.

   An interstate probe of computer hacking has
uncovered losses that may reach millions of dollars and could be
``just the tip of the iceberg,'' federal law enforcement officials
said Wednedsay.
   No computer-crime arrests resulted, however, when 27 search
warrants served in a dozen cities were served by 150 Secret Service
agents and police on Tuesday, officials said. Three people _ one
each in Chicago, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh _ were arrested for
unrelated offenses, officials said.
   Secret Service officials declined to release any specifics,
including the number of people targeted, saying the two-year
investigation, code-named ``Operation Sun Devil,'' was continuing.
   The probe is focused on illegal entry into computer systems and
unauthorized use of credit-card numbers and long-distance codes,
said Garry M. Jenkins, assistant Secret Service director for
investigations.
   ``The losses that we estimate on this may run to the millions of
dollars,'' said U.S. Attorney for Arizona Stephen McNamee, who
joined Jenkins and Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin at a news
conference.
   ``Most of you have been taking this as a game,'' Corbin told
reporters. ``It is not a game. ... They're not all kids. They're
adults, too.''
   Much of the alleged loss stems from unpaid telephone and
computer access charges, the officials said.
   They said it was possible that hackers had gotten goods or cash
through use of unauthorized credit cards, but could not cite any
instance of it.
   In addition to misuse of credit cards and phone lines, the
hackers are believed to have gotten into computers that store
medical and financial histories, the officials said.
   The case ``appears to be the largest so far'' in the field, said
assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Holtzen. However, it ``is probably only
the tip of the iceberg'' when it comes to computer crime, he said.
   Statements from the Secret Service and the Justice Department
gave conflicting information on the number and locations of the
cities where searches were made.
   In addition to searches in or near Phoenix, there were searches
conducted this week in or near Chicago; Cincinnati; Detroit; Los
Angeles; Miami; Newark, N.J.; New York City; Pittsburgh; Richmond,
Va.; Plano, Texas, and San Diego.
   Also listed in some of the statements were San Jose, Calif.;
Saginaw, Mich.; San Francisco and Tucson. Officials said they were
unable to explain the discrepancies.
   Documents on the search warrants will be sealed pending further
investigation, assistant Attorney General Gail Thackery said.
   Under new computer crime laws, the Secret Service has
jurisdiction to investigate allegations of electronic fraud through
the use of access devices such as credit-card numbers and codes
long-distance companies issue to individual callers.
   Defendants convicted of unauthorized use of such ``access
devices'' can be sentenced up to 10 years in prison if they commit
fraud of more than $1,000, according to the law.
   A similar investigation supervised by federal prosecutors in
Chicago has resulted in several indictments.

   Philanthropist Grace Ford Salvatori, wife of
millionaire industrialist Henry Salvatori and a leading fund-raiser
for the Los Angeles Music Center, has died. She was 80.
   She died Saturday at her Bel-Air home, the family said. A
service was held Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.
   The Salvatoris gave many gifts to schools, hospitals and
shelters, but helping raise funds to build the Music Center was
Mrs. Salvatori's proudest accomplishment, said her daughter, Laurie
Ann O'Connell.
   The $34 million center, with three auditoriums built between
1962 and 1967, gave the city a much-needed home for the performing
arts.
   She also made major gifts to the University of Southern
California, the Marlborough School and other educational
institutions, as well as Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, St.
John's Hospital, the Hospital of the Good Samaritan and the Los
Angeles Mission.
   A native of Oklahoma, Mrs. Salvatori came to Los Angeles as an
aspiring actress. She was briefly under contract to MGM Studios.
She and Salvatori, who was in the oil business, were married in
1937.
   Along with her husband and daughter, Mrs. Salvatori is survived
by a son, Henry Ford Salvatori, and a grandson.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Asks Stiffer Penalties for Cross Burnings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
Wednesday he has asked Congress to stiffen criminal penalties for
cross burnings and other forms of racial harassment that do not
result in personal injuries.
   The proposed amendments to the landmark 1968 Civil Rights Act
would make cross burnings a felony under federal law punishable by
a five-year prison sentence and a fine up to $250,000.
   The offense is now a misdemeanor that carries a maximum one-year
sentence and a $100,000 fine.
   Misdemeanor penalties would be retained to allow prosecutors to
bring lesser charges in appropriate cases, the department said in a
letter to Congress.
   The harsher penalties are proposed for what Thornburgh called
``particularly egregious cases _ those where firearms are used or
fire or threats of fire, including cross burnings, are employed.''
   Thornburgh's statement cited a case in which people who burned
down a home rented by a black family were prosecuted for a
misdemeanor because there were no injuries.
   The law would also apply to situations in which shots are fired
into homes but there are no injuries. Prosecutors would have to
prove racial or ethnic harassment motivated the incident.
   In another case, prosecutors could only bring misdemeanor
charges against people accused of burning down a house trailer
occupied by a biracial family, Thornburgh said.
   The proposed amendments deal with the use or the threat of force
to interfere with a citizen's right to fair housing.
   ``The message of hatred and violence that cross burnings convey
inflicts enormous psychological damage on victims, particularly
children who live in a targeted house,'' the Justice Department
said its letter to Congress last month that was released Wednesday.
   ``Frequently, lives are disrupted as families flee neighborhoods
altogether or members alter schedules to protect their families and
homes,'' said the letter by Bruce C. Navarro, the acting head of
the department's legislative affairs office.
   State charges of arson may be filed by local prosecutors in many
jurisdictions. These crimes carry heavier penalties.
   But cross burning is often treated as malicious mischief and
shootings that do not result in injuries may be minor felonies,
such as assault or attempted assault.
   Local authorities may not be willing to invest the time to
investigate a crime that carries a light penalty, said Daniel
Rinzel, head of the Justice Department unit that prosecutes hate
crimes.
   ``Most cross burnings take some work to try to figure out who
did it,'' Rinzel said.
   ``There are some incidents that you could consider to be serious
simply because people were lucky they weren't injured'' but are
nonetheless treated as misdemeanors by the law, Rinzel said.

<HEAD>Saldana Attacker Agrees to Face Murder Charges in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Scottish drifter who critically wounded
actress Theresa Saldana in a 1982 stabbing has agreed to return to
England to face charges in a homicide committed there nearly 23
years ago.
   Arthur Richard Jackson, 53, waived extradition proceedings
during a Tuesday hearing before U.S. Magistrate Venetta S.
Tassopulos.
   Jackson could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted in the
shooting death of a passer-by during a June 1967 bank robbery in
London, said Angus Mackay, Britain's vice consul in Los Angeles.
   Jackson still faces trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on
charges he sent 16 threatening letters to Miss Saldana, 34, while
serving a 12-year prison term for attacking her with a kitchen
knife outside her West Hollywood apartment on March 15, 1982.
   The actress was hospitalized for 3{ months and underwent five
major operations to repair wounds to her heart, lungs, legs and
arms.
   ``It is our intention to try him on those charges and convict
him here,'' said Sandi Gibbons, a district attorney's spokeswoman.
``But he can serve his sentence anywhere, in England as well as the
United States. Once we've convicted him, England is welcome to have
him.''
   The charges filed last June were based on seven letters Jackson
is accused of sending Miss Saldana and former water delivery man
Jeff Fenn, who rescued Miss Saldana during the 1982 stabbing attack
and held Jackson for police.
   Jackson allegedly wrote in one letter that he regretted using a
knife because ``a gun would have given me a better chance of
reunion with you in heaven,'' authorities say.
   Jackson had a history of mental problems when he entered the
United States illegally in 1982.
   In Britain, Jackson is accused of killing a passer-by who chased
him after the June 1967 bank robbery. He also is accused of
wounding two bank employees in that robbery, as well as two other
armed robberies in 1965 and 1967.
   Jackson was not identified as a suspect in those crimes until
June 1987, when he sent Scotland Yard a letter admitting his
involvement and saying he wanted ``to be extradited to England
immediately,'' U.S. court documents say.
   Miss Saldana's agent, Morgan Paul, said he worried that Jackson
would avoid a long prison term in England and return to the United
States to stalk the actress again.
   ``He has been extradited three previous times and he's always
gotten back here,'' Paul said. ``We want a sure thing. We want to
know where he is at all times.''

   A lawsuit filed against the FBI after the
agency's ill-fated investigation of an organization opposed to U.S.
intervention in Central America was dismissed by a federal judge
Wednesday.
   U.S. District Court Judge George Revercomb granted the FBI's
motion to end the lawsuit filed by CISPES, the Committee in
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador.
   The case is moot because the FBI agreed Feb. 24 to transfer all
records pertaining to CISPES to the National Archives, Revercomb
said.
   The FBI investigated CISPES for alleged terrorist activity based
on a tip from a paid informant who was found to be untrustworthy.
   Earlier, the FBI conceded that its investigation was flawed,
disciplined a number of agents and amended its guidelines for
conducting investigations.
   The group said the Feb. 24 agreement does not cover copies of
CISPES records provided to other agencies such as the Terrorist
Information Center, the State Department or foreign police agencies.
   The FBI ``can only dispose of records over which they have
custody or control,'' Revercomb said. ``Information and records ...
already disseminated ... are beyond the disposal power'' of the
bureau.
   CISPES sought an injunction directing the FBI to recover all
copies of its files and computer data bases and to deposit them
with the archives.
   ``People have to get more sophisticated about potential
government abuse and understand it can occur with computers as well
as paper,'' said Margaret Ratner, an attorney representing the
committee.
   She said CISPES had not been allowed to see the agreement
between the FBI and the archives and that she doubted computer
files had been purged.
   Revercomb said that although CISPES records have been
distributed to other agencies, ``the possibility that a federal
employer is going to contact these other entities ... for security
checks ... is too remote to be tenable.''
   Members of a number of groups were placed under surveillance as
a result of the FBI investigation and spinoff probes. CISPES
alleged the FBI had violated the First Amendment and the Privacy
Act of 1974.

   Palestinians shut their stores to mark the 30th
month of their uprising against Israeli rule and troops shot and
wounded 27 Arab protesters, Arab hospital officials said.
   Throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, transportation
ground to a halt and businesses closed to mark the anniversary of
the beginning of the revolt.
   Arab reports said a 14-year-old boy was shot in the head in
clashes with soldiers in the West Bank town of Hebron. Hospital
officials reported him to be in serious condition.
   In the West Bank's Askar refugee camp near Nablus, 22
Palestinians were wounded by gunfire in confrontations with
soldiers, hospital officials said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, four Arabs were wounded in clashes,
a military spokesman said.
   The army also confirmed three of the wounded in the West Bank
and said they were investigating the other incidents.
   At least 683 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
revolt, and 43 Israelis have died in the violence.
   At least 212 Arabs have been killed by the fellow Palestinians
on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities or for moral
offenses such as prostitution or drug dealing.

   Tanks, missiles and troops paraded through Red
Square on Wednesday to celebrate the World War II defeat of Nazi
Germany, stirring emotions over the reunification of a former foe
and the secession of three republics.
   ``Military danger still exists in the world,'' Defense Minister
Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov said moments before he sent five new pieces
of military hardware roaring past the assembled Kremlin leadership
and Western spectators.
   Yazov, who led a rifle regiment in World War II, also praised in
his speech the ``new thinking'' of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
which he said had lowered tensions in a Europe that was divided
after the Nazi defeat in 1945.
   Gorbachev did not address the event, but smiled at participants
as he led the leadership onto Lenin's Mausoleum to watch.
   Western diplomats applauded as he left the tribunal afterward,
and in salute he raised a bouquet presented by military cadets
during the ceremony.
   The celebration affected other Soviets differently.
   Some veterans interviewed after the parade expressed misgivings
about German reunification. One senior naval officer thundered: ``I
killed Germans then, and if I have to I'll kill them again!'' He
refused to give his name to an American reporter.
   Emotions also ran high in the Baltic republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia, which the Soviet Union forcibly annexed during
the war but which have moved toward independence this year.
   The Army staged Victory Day rallies in all three Baltic
capitals, and in Latvia and Lithuania they turned into
demonstrations for and against secession.
   In Latvia, which declared independence on May 4, a rally turned
into a march by 5,000 protesters, supported by the Communist Party
and military.
   ``We consider the declaration of independence a defeat for
everyone,'' said Lt. Gen. Oleg Zinchenko, head of the political
directorate of the Baltic Military Region, which encompasses the
three republics.
   Zinchenko, saying he spoke for the Armed Forces, said appeals
from the military to the Kremlin to intervene more forcefully in
the Baltics were not signs of weakness.
   ``Nothing could be more dangerous than that misperception,'' he
told the crowd, many of whom waved bright red banners as well as
Latvian flags emblazoned with the Soviet hammer and sickle.
   In the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, a witness said 200 people
tried to block a Victory Day procession. They shouted, ``Occupiers
go home!'' as the veterans marched along Gediminas Avenue near a
monument to Soviet Gen. Ivan Chernyakhovsky, a World War II hero.
   The protesters tried to block the veterans, who were apparently
Russians, but a cordon of paratroopers prevented them, said Pranas
Karlonas, a Lithuanian radio editor.
   Lithuania declared independence on March 11, and Latvia followed
suit on May 4. On Tuesday, Estonia took some steps toward
independence, without formally declaring it.
   In the Estonian capital of Tallinn, the Soviet Army paraded, but
there were no confrontations, said Neme Bruus, an editor at
Estonian Radio.
   At the Red Square parade in Moscow, the Army took the unusual
step of displaying five new pieces of hardware, some of which had
never been seen by Western military observers.
   ``I think it's a very strong message that the army is still
valued within Soviet society, that they're still a capable force,
and that they're still valued by President Gorbachev,'' said Henry
Dodds, editor of Jane's Soviet Intelligence Review, in an interview
broadcast by Britain's Sky TV.
   The motorized portion of the parade began with an echelon of
T-34 tanks, which were first produced in 1943 and were the
workhorse of Soviet armor in the march to Berlin.
   Overall, the Soviets showed 18 modern weapons systems.
   ``For the military buffs there were some very interesting pieces
of equipment. The first thing that we saw was a new armored
personnel carrier,'' Dodds said, referring to a BMD-2 airborne
combat vehicle, equipped with an anti-tank missile and designed to
be dropped with paratroopers.
   ``This is absolutely brand new. There was only some suggestion
of it having been in existence towards the end of last year. And it
was absolutely remarkable to see it being displayed in Moscow
today,'' Dodds said.
   A senior Western military attache said the centerpiece of the
Soviet display was a new SAM-10 surface to air missile. Long, sleek
trucks each carried four of the new missles, inside cannisters
painted in camouflage.
   Another hot item in the Soviet parade was the latest tank, a
T-80 variant known to the West as the Soviet Medium Tank 1989, for
the year it entered service, said the NATO officer.
   One thing missing from the parade was an American Legion
marching band that traveled to Moscow from Massachusetts. Soviet
officials initially told the band it could march, but said
Wednesday it would not be allowed onto Red Square.
   Instead, the 70-member band played outside the Bolshoi Theater,
and band leader Dorothy ``Dot'' Hill said she was not disappointed.
   ``Victory Day was far more impressive to me than where it was,''
she said. ``Having it where they had it was perfect. It couldn't
have been any better.''

   Tens of thousands of students,
dissidents and radicals battled riot police in more than a dozen
cities Wednesday to demand the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo.
Police arrested more than 900 people.
   In downtown Seoul, students hurled rocks and firebombs in the
most violent anti-government protests in the capital since 1987.
Dozens of police and protesters suffered injuries, some serious,
but no figures were available.
   Protesters set fire to a U.S. diplomatic building, firebombed a
police bus, truck and jeep, occupied the front of one of the
capital's luxury hotels and took control of a fashionable downtown
shopping area for more than three hours.
   Two U.S. guards were slightly injured by rock-throwing
demonstrators, a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said
in Washington.
   Violence erupted as the newly created Democratic Liberal Party
held its inaugural convention. Radicals and dissidents claim the
gigantic party, a merger of three political groups, will lead to
dictatorship.
   Roh's party is declining in popularity as inflation rises, but
most South Koreans do not support radicals who espouse violence.
   ``Yankee go home!'' screamed thousands of students hurling
firebombs and rocks. ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!''
   At the height of the fighting, some 15,000 students rampaged
through an area two or three miles wide from the Seoul railway
station to Dondaemun market, the country's largest wholesale market.
   Protesters ripped up sidewalks and metal grating to make
missiles. Street signs were taken apart to use as weapons against
police armed with tear-gas masks, truncheons and shields.
   Clouds of choking tear gas billowed over the center of this
capital city of 10 million people, sending office workers and
shopkeepers racing for cover at the evening rush hour, holding
their mouth and nose to keep out the acrid gas.
   Thousands of riot police in the city center appeared to be taken
by surprise as throngs of 300 to 2,000 radical students dashed
along sidewalks to occupy main downtown shopping streets.
   Screaming protesters overpowered at least two groups of 200 to
300 riot police and seized their helmets, clubs, shields and other
items. Students forced dozens of police to kneel with their hands
behind their backs and shouted insults, kicking and beating them
with fists and clubs.
   ``Disband the DLP!'' students yelled repeatedly.
   After nightfall, about 3,000 students occupied a block around
the U.S. Information Service center for two hours before being
driven back by volleys of tear gas fired from black armored police
vans.
   Students broke at least seven windows at the four-story center
and threw firebombs into a first-floor window, touching off a fire
that raged out of control for more than an hour with flames
reaching up to the second story.
   Firefighters and U.S. Army fire trucks from the nearby American
base extinguished the blaze after police regained control of the
street.
   The front gate of the center was shuttered and it was unknown
whether there were people inside the building, which includes a
library and agriculture and trade offices.
   Boucher said the two injured U.S. guards were outside the
building. He said no U.S. personnel were known to be in the
building during the fighting.
   ``Early indications are that there was considerable smoke and
water damage to the building,'' he told a news briefing in
Washington.
   The radicals, who want unification with Communist North Korea,
demand the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   In front of the luxury Hotel Lotte across the street from the
American building, a torched police bus and a jeep burned several
hours. The hotel was shuttered, its driveway littered with broken
bottles, glass and rocks.
   The protests were the most violent in the capital since 1987,
when nationwide demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of citizens
forced former dictatorial President Chun Doo-hwan to carry out
major democratic reforms. Roh was elected president in December
1987 and succeeded Chun in February 1988.
   The violent clashes spread to 16 other cities and involved an
estimated 50,000 protesters nationwide, police and news reports
said. Police said they arrested at least 912 people.
   Radicals attacked governing party offices in three provincial
cities, destroying the office in the central city of Chongju,
according to Yonhap, the national news agency. Yonhap said five
police stations in the country were attacked.
   In the southern city of Taegu, about 100 riot police brandishing
iron pipes attacked protesters during a street clash, injuring 20
protesters, Yonhap said.

<TEXT>
   Zoo officials on Wednesday announced the
birth of the world's first test-tube tigers and said in-vitro
fertilization could help preserve the endangered tiger population
as well as other species.
   Dr. Lee Simmons said two yellow tiger cubs and one white male
were delivered by Caesarian section on April 27 at Omaha's Henry
Doorly Zoo to the surrogate mother, a 9{-year-old Siberian tiger
named Nicole.
   The parents of the three cubs were a white Bengal tiger and two
Bengal tiger mothers, Simmons said.
   The white male cub died shortly after birth because of
respiratory complications unrelated to the in-vitro fertilization.
But the other two yellow-and-brown striped cubs, a male and a
female, are strong and healthy and being hand-reared at the Omaha
zoo, Simmons said.
   The births mean preserving an endangered species is possible and
helps the cause of researchers and zoos, Simmons said.
   ``For some of the conservationists, research has been a
four-letter word,'' Simmons said.
   Seeing the two ``cuddly little cubs can help show that maybe
research isn't such a bad thing,'' he said.
   Three zoos _ Doorly, the National Zoological Park in Washington,
D.C., and the Minnesota Zoological Gardens in Minneapolis _ have
collaborated on the project for more than 10 years.
   The in-vitro techniques have been used successfully in humans
and in farm animals, but progress has been slow in adapting the
techniques to wild animals, Simmons said.
   Research has focused on tigers because at least three of the
eight remaining tiger subspecies have become extinct in the past 20
years and only 50 tigers remain in the critically endangered South
China subspecies, Simmons said.
   The program began with a National Zoo research program using the
techniques on domestic cats. It is aimed at ultimately taking the
technology and techniques into the wild, Simmons said.
   He outlined a scenario that begins with frozen embryos from
tigers in captivity in Omaha or other zoos.
   ``We go into the wild in India and Nepal and capture a female
for a short time,'' he said.
   During that time, scientists would induce ovulation and collect
the tiger's eggs, he said. They also would transfer the frozen
embryos to the wild tiger and turn her loose.
   ``About 110 days later, she would deliver cubs that she would
raise in the wild,'' Simmons said. ``They (the cubs) would expand
and enhance the gene pool.''
   Expanding the gene pool is important as the populations of
endangered animals decrease, Simmons said.
   As the habitats shrink and become more isolated, the wild
populations ``fall prey to inbreeding,'' Simmons said.
   The dwindling habitat means that the tigers ``may still be
running free in a forest, but they have unfortunately become just
as captive as animals in the zoo,'' he said.
   ``The techniques can help enhance the survival of the zoo
captives and the wild captives,'' Simmons said.
   The program in the wild still is years away as technology
develops to make the mobile in-vitro lab really mobile, Simmons
said.
   The in-vitro technique involves a veterinarian treating the
donor female tigers with a hormone to stimulate growth of follicles
in the ovaries. The eggs in the follicles then are stimulated to
develop further with a second hormone injection.
   A day later, the tiger is anesthetized and examined. The eggs
then are collected with a needle inserted through the abdominal
wall.
   The eggs are placed with sperm collected from a male in a
special medium in a warm incubator. In 12 hours, embryos are
surgically transferred into the reproductive tract of the surrogate
mother.
   The tigers involved in this first birth all came from the Omaha
zoo, which has 40 tigers _ one of the largest tiger populations in
the world, Simmons said.

<HEAD>Foreign Secretary: Talks With Iran Possible If Bring Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Wednesday that
direct talks with Iran to secure the release of British hostages
were possible if they were likely to produce results.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain in Feburary 1989
after the country's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
urged Moslems to kill Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie for
blaspheming Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Britain has come under increasing pressure to try to free four
hostages missing in Lebanon following the release of American
captives Robert Polhill and Frank Reed, who strongly criticized
British inaction.
   ``I do not rule out the possibility of direct talks if we felt
that they were likely to produce results. But the restoration of
diplomatic relations ... is certainly not a matter for us alone,''
Hurd told the House of Commons.
   ``We shall do everything we can to bring about the release of
all the hostages _ short of making concessions or striking bargains
with those who hold them _ because we want a safer world not a more
dangerous one,'' he said.
   Hurd acknowledged the Syrian role in Reed's release but added:
``We broke with Syria in 1986 on the issue of state-supported
terrorism _ an issue that remains unresolved.
   ``We have had indirect talks with them since then on behalf of
the hostages.''
   Britain cut diplomatic ties with Damascus for allegedly using
its embassy in London to help plot the unsuccessful destruction of
an Israeli jetliner at Heathrow Airport.
   Opposition Labor Party lawmaker Gerald Kaufman, referring to
Reed's charge of British inaction, asked Hurd to say ``the
government is active day-in, day-out in efforts to secure the
release of the British hostages.''
   Hurd agreed people had every right to expect ``day-in, day-out''
efforts and these were continuing.
   ``I have every sympathy with Mr. Frank Reed ... but he is not in
any position to know anything about the efforts we have made on
behalf of the British hostages,'' Hurd said.
   The hostages are Church of England envoy Terry Waite, journalist
John McCarthy, retired pilot Jack Mann and Brian Keenan, a teacher
who has dual British and Irish nationality.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   Former Liberal leader Sir David Steel suggested there was a case
for considering the reopening of diplomatic links with Libya and
Syria.
   Hurd said there were three ``substantial'' problems with Iran:
the hostages, the imprisonment of Briton Roger Cooper on spying
charges and the threat to kill Rushdie.
   Labor's Harry Barnes urged ministers to stop taking an
``intransigent stance'' in developing links with Iran and Syria and
``take a lead'' from the United States.
   ``I have discussed policy with the U.S. Secretary of State Mr.
(James) Baker in the last few days and it is entirely on on
all-fours with that of the U.S.,'' Hurd said.
   Lawmakers also criticized claims by British Moslem leader Sayed
Quddus that Waite would be released by his Beirut captors only if
Rushdie was extradited to Iran.
   Quddus, a former secretary of the council of mosques in Bradford
who was one of the first Moslems in Britain to publicly burn
Rushdie's novel, said he was told this during a recent visit to
Iran. He said he was also told Waite is alive and well.
   Conservative lawmaker Gary Waller said the idea of extraditing
Rushdie was ``totally outrageous.''
   The British hostages are among 16 Westerners, including six
Americans, believed held in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Report Blames U.S. for Some Civilian Deaths in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Failure by the U.S. military to issue a
warning before attacking Panamanian Defense Force headquarters may
have led to the deaths of dozens of civilians living nearby, a
report said Wednesday.
   ``Some 15,000 persons were left homeless in the attack, and a
very rough estimate is that 50 (to) 70 civilians were killed,''
according to the Americas Watch study conducted after the December
invasion of Panama.
   ``Many more were seriously wounded,'' the report said.
   The Pentagon had no immediate comment.
   Americas Watch, which promotes human rights in Latin America and
the Caribbean, contends that both the U.S. and Panamanian military
violated international humanitarian law governing armed conflict.
   It said the U.S. military failed to observe the laws of war in
its attack on the PDF headquarters, located in the midst of a poor
Panama City neighborhood called El Chorrillo.
   The report gave little credence to allegations by some observers
that forces loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega were responsible
for fires that broke out in El Chorrillo and left numerous civilian
casualties.
   Noriega was ousted by the invading force and later brought to
the United States for trial on drug trafficking charges.
   The study said U.S. military leaders were unable to cite
military necessity, such as the need for surprise, as a reason for
not informing El Chorrillo residents that an attack was imminent.
   Roman Catholic priests said in January that about 20 people died
in El Chorrillo, many in a fire set by retreating paramilitary
supporters of Noriega. They said that nearly 10,000 people sought
refuge in the church and the school and a home for the elderly next
to it.
   The Rev. Javier Arteta said members of the Panamanian
paramilitary Dignity Battalions bear much of the blame for the
casualties.
   ``They came out of their homes shooting in every direction,''
Arteta said, adding that the U.S. military never fired in the
direction of the church.
   The Americas Watch report also said the U.S. military failed to
follow the laws of war in refusing to free prisoners after
hostilities ceased.
   Noriega's forces violated international law by taking civilian
hostages and by dressing as civilians during the fighting, thus
attracting fire and exposing innocent people to combat, the report
said.
   The study said the U.S. Southern Command in Panama undercounted
the number of civilian deaths. The Pentagon total was 202, but the
report said 300 was ``more likely the real figure.''
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark has estimated the
death toll at 4,000 to 7,000, but the report said there was no
basis for such a finding.

<HEAD>Supporters Of Family Leave Bill Say Bush Flip-Flopped</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: House has scheduled only procedural votes Wednesday night;

   Supporters of a bill guaranteeing unpaid time
off for workers in family emergencies cited President Bush's own
1988 campaign rhetoric Wednesday, saying he supported provisions in
an election year that he now threatens to veto.
   The House began debating the family and medical leave bill, with
a vote scheduled for Thursday.
   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., a liberal Republican who supports the
bill, quoted Bush from a September 1988 campaign appearance in
which he said the presidential candidate seemed to be supporting
just such a measure.
   Bush, Green said, told a Republican women's group: ``We need to
assure that women don't have to worry about getting their jobs back
after having a child or caring for a child during a serious
illness. That is what I mean when I talk about a gentler nation.''
   Bush's press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said a day earlier that
Bush would veto the bill if passed, and that while Bush urged
employers to offer guaranteed job-protected leave, he opposed any
bill requiring periods of leave.
   ``Let me note he used the word `assure,''' Green said, referring
to Bush's campaign speech. ``He didn't say we should urge employers
to do it. ... The only way we can do that is by legislation.''
   The bill would require businesses with 50 or more employees to
offer unpaid time off for the care of newborn, newly adopted or
seriously ill children, as well as to deal with personal health
problems or ill spouses or parents.
   House opponents of the bill charged it would be too costly and
burdensome for businesses.
   Rep. James Quillen, R-Tenn., said it would reduce employers'
flexibility in offering benefits to employees.
   ``This bill will do serious damage to many small businesses and
medium-sized businesses,'' Quillen said.
   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., charged his own party's leaders were
using ``unfair and heavy-handed'' tactics and trying to ram the
bill through without permitting moderate amendments.
   The family leave bill is the second of two major social issues
that the White House has threatened to veto this year. A conference
committee has been named to work out House and Senate differences
on a broader bill providing designed to help families find and
afford child care, which also is under a veto threat.
   Under the bill sent to the House floor, employers would have to
offer up to 18 weeks of unpaid family leave over a two-year period
and up to 15 weeks a year for a sick worker. A proposed substitute
backed by the bill's bipartisan supporters and expected to be
adopted would change that to 12 weeks in both cases.
   Under the bill, an employee returning from leave must be
restored to his or her previous job or an equivalent position.
Employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for
those on leave.
   Women's groups supporting the bill contend that workers,
particularly women, suffer substantial earnings losses after the
birth of a child or during illnesses because many can't return to
their jobs at the same pay.
   Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, opposed
the bill. They charged it would be a costly burden for employers,
hurting productivity. Although the bill requires employers to offer
only unpaid leave, some opponents were concerned it could lead to
later legislation requiring paid leave or other benefits.
   The presidential veto threat was backed up in a formal
``statement of administration policy'' sent to Congress by the
Office of Management and Budget, saying the administration
``strongly opposes'' the bill.
   ``If this or any other mandated leave legislation were presented
to the president, his senior advisers would recommend that it be
vetoed,'' the statement said.
   It said the bill would ``induce employers to reduce overall
employee benefits'' because of the expense of the new requirement.

<HEAD>Proposal: Let Romanian Parliament Name President, Scrub Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two opposition candidates said
Wednesday they would withdraw from the presidential race if interim
President Ion Iliescu also agreed to step down and let a newly
elected Parliament choose the president.
   The offer came after violence and a prolonged anti-government
demonstration marred the first weeks of campaigning for the May 20
elections.
   Presidential candidates Ion Ratiu of the National Peasants'
Party and Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal Party both suffered
violent attacks during campaign appearances.
   Campeanu canceled campaign appearances this week after suffering
cuts to the face in an assault in Braila on Saturday. He said he
hoped the withdrawal ``would restore a climate of peace and
stability'' to the country.
   The two opposition parties say supporters of Iliescu's National
Salvation Front have disrupted their campaigns and are harassing
their candidates.
   Wednesday's offer drew no immediate reply from Iliescu, who was
out of Bucharest at large campaign rallies.
   The development highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the
political process in Romania almost five months after the December
revolution that ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and
less than two weeks before elections.
   In separate ballots, voters are to choose a new parliament and a
new president. Opinion polls _ whose reliability has been
questioned by foreign observers _ heavily favor the Front and
Iliescu, who have dominated politics since the revolution.
   A downtown Bucharest demonstration against Iliescu and the Front
entered its 18th day Wednesday. About 2,000 people gathered to
demand Iliescu's resignation and to shout slogans denouncing the
Front as ``neo-communists.''
   Leading former dissident Doina Cornea said she was joining 56
hunger strikers in the protest. Some have taken nothing but tea for
10 days.
   The demonstrators want former Communist officials such as
Iliescu barred by law from politics.
   Campeanu and Ratiu made their offer to withdraw at the request
of an anti-government group that wants the elections postponed.
   Police said Wednesday they detained five people responsible for
the attack on Campeanu, and filed charges against two of them. A
third was sent to a psychiatric hospital for examination. All were
from 28 and 39 years old.
   The state news agency Rompres said a man with six previous
criminal convictions was jailed for 18 months for disturbing the
peace during a campaign appearance by Ratiu in Buzau, northeast of
Bucharest, April 24.
   Iliescu meanwhile continued his campaign. State-run radio said
100,000 people attended Iliescu's rally in the central city of
Brasov.
   In Liberty Square in Ploiesti, 38 miles north of Bucharest,
about 20,000 enthusiastic Front supporters heard Iliescu dismiss
the demands of the Bucharest demonstrators as an electoral maneuver.
   ``We love him because he took us out of Ceausescu's hell'' said
Ion Radu, a 66-year-old peasant who was in the audience.

   Ninety-five anti-abortion protesters held
11 weeks in a Vermont jail for failing to identify themselves after
their arrests finally did so and were promptly released Wednesday.
   ``For some reason, they all agreed to give their names, be
fingerprinted and signed a waiver of right to trial,'' said Edward
Sutton, deputy state's attorney.
   Under the agreement, District Judge Matthew Katz then found them
guilty of unlawful trespass, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum
of 90 days in jail. They were sentenced and released for time
served.
   The protesters agreed to give their names after being told they
would not have to pay bail or a fine and that no probation would be
set on them, said their lawyer, Daniel Lynch.
   In addition, Lynch said, under the agreement they did not plead
guilty to unlawful trespass; instead they admitted to the facts of
the case and were found guilty by the judge.
   The 95 had been held without bail even though they were charged
with only a misdemeanor because they refused to identify themselves
in court.
   ``Many of us will be back,'' said Joan Andrews, 41, a founder of
the anti-abortion ``rescue'' movement in 1979 who was among those
jailed. ``If the movement here is being threatened again, I will
certainly try to make it back.''
   The protesters had been arrested following a series of sit-ins
at two Burlington abortion clinics between Feb. 21 and April 17.
   ``Frankly, these people are not acting as individuals, but as
followers of a few leaders'' said Sutton. ``They take orders.''
   The protesters were jailed for up to 78 days, about a week more
than they most likely would have been held had they been tried and
convicted.
   During their arraignments, they had identified themselves as
``Baby Jane Doe'' and ``Baby John Doe.'' The judge's decision to
hold them without bail for refusing to give their names is under
appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court.
   Only eight of the 95 protesters were from Vermont. The rest were
from Canada, California, Iowa, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio,
Tennessee, Texas, Washington state and the Northeast.
   In addition to Ms. Andrews, several national leaders of the
anti-abortion movement were among those jailed. They included the
Rev. Norman Weslin, 59, head of the Victim Souls for the Unborn
Christ Child, headquartered in Mountlake Terrace, Wash.
   The jailing cost the state of Vermont $6,000 a day.

<HEAD>Lithuania Premier: Republic Will Exhaust Fuel Supplies in 2 Weeks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
said Wednesday transportation and industry in the breakaway Baltic
republic will halt within two weeks because of the Soviet economic
blockade.
   ``By May 25 we will have a crisis. ... Our reserves of crude oil
will run out by then,'' she said. ``Because of a lack of black
(crude) oil and fuel, light industry, transport and, in general,
different branches of our economy will close.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene, addressing a news conference after talks with
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said her administration is saving
emergency fuel supplies for hospitals and schools, and was
self-sufficient in food.
   Medicine was coming from Poland, she said.
   ``And we have luck on our side because summer is coming up,''
Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters, speaking through an interpreter.
   She reiterated that Lithuania will not rescind its March 11
declaration of independence, but again offered to compromise with
Moscow by suspending subsequent laws on citizenship and property.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has refused to negotiate
with the Baltic republic and retaliated against its declaration of
independence with an economic blockade.
   She said it appeared doubtful Moscow would use force if the
crisis worsened.
   ``Those who wanted to punish Lithuania have actually been
satisfied,'' she said.
   Mrs. Prunskiene spoke at the end of a two-day visit to Britain,
part of a tour to drum up support in the West. She arrived after
meeting with President Bush in Washington and will travel from
London to Paris and Bonn.
   She said Mrs. Thatcher was sympathetic during their 75-minute
meeting but Mrs. Prunskiene appeared to have gained little in
substance. Mrs. Prunskiene saw similar results after he meeting
with Bush.
   Thatcher aides said Britain's priority remained not to upset
Gorbachev.
   ``We don't want the apple cart upset, but we do sympathize with
them (Lithuanians),'' said one British official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Mrs. Prunskiene, at the news conference at a house in west
London's Notting Hill district used as a Lithuanian center,
acknowledged that the West ``is not rushing to help.''
   But she said she was encouraged by moves toward independence by
the neighboring Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia.
   ``I cannot imagine that the West will simply look on while
Latvia and Estonia have sanctions imposed against them, while they
are being suffocated,'' she said.
   Also Wednesday, Finnish President Mauno Koivisto, in an address
before the 354-member parliamentary assembly of the Council of
Europe, urged the three Baltic republics to negotiate with Moscow
for their independence.
   Citing Finland's history of accomodation with the Soviet Union,
he suggested the Baltic states offer Moscow neutrality in return
for independence.
   ``Our own experience tells us that with a great power neighbor
one has to reach negotiated solutions that will stand the test of
time,'' Koivisto said.
   In 1948, Moscow pressured Finland into a friendship treaty
guaranteeing Finnish neutrality and precluding anti-Soviet policies
in Helsinki.

<HEAD>Justice Says No Reason Not to Release Bloch Court Paper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Wednesday urged a
court to make public the pleadings filed by suspected spy Felix
Bloch in his fight against State Department efforts to fire him.
   The Justice Department said in a court filing that Bloch had
``failed to demonstrate any reason'' why the court document his
attorneys filed May 2 should not be placed in the public court file.
   Bloch's attorneys are challenging the government's attempt to
use information obtained from foreign counterintelligence
surveillance as evidence against the suspended diplomat in State
Department administrative proceedings.
   Bloch's lawyers contend that the surveillances were illegal. The
Justice Department has asked U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris
to declare that the information was legally obtained and therefore
can be used against Bloch in the termination hearing.
   The Justice Department has not brought criminal charges against
Bloch, whom law enforcement sources say is suspected of having
passed secrets to the Soviet Union while he was posted in Europe as
a diplomat. There have been reports that French agents videotaped
him passing a briefcase to a KGB agent in Paris.
   The Justice Department disputed the argument by Bloch's lawyers
that the May 2 pleadings should kept under seal because they
contain sensitive information.
   Bloch's memorandum ``contains no classified information and
filing it on the public record of this case would not harm the
national security nor impede the underlying administrative
proceeding'' being conducted by the State Department, the Justice
petition argued.
   Bloch's hearing was scheduled to begin this week, but it has
been postponed.
   In a separate pleading, the Justice Department reiterated its
opposition to an attempt by Bloch's lawyers to obtain access to all
the audio tapes and transcripts of the electronic surveillances.
   Bloch's attorneys have received copies of the tapes and
transcripts of the material the State Department wants to use. But
the lawyers have asked Harris to order the government to turn over
all the surveillance information.
   The FBI has filed an affidavit stating that further disclosures
to Bloch would endanger national security.
   The Justice Department also rejected a suggestion by Bloch's
attorneys that they could receive the material because they already
have security clearances.
   Bloch's lawyers had pledged not to disclose any of the material
to their client, but the Justice Department said this would place
them in an untenable position.
   Bloch's lawyers ``would have access to materials their client
has not seen (and cannot see),'' the department said. ``This fact
would make it difficult or impossible for them to give proper
advice to their client as Mr. Bloch attempts to make informed
decisions throughout the litigation,'' the department said, noting
Bloch might be confronted with the choice of ``whether or not to
seek a settlement.''
   Bloch's lawyers ``then would have a conflict of interest in
representing their client,'' the department said.

   A federal judge Wednesday sided with three
states and ordered the Army of Corps of Engineers to maintain water
levels at a huge Missouri River reservoir in order to protect the
states' fishing industry.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy's ruling regarding Lake Oahe
prompted shippers to begin moving barges off the Missouri's
730-mile shipping channel to keep them from being marooned as the
river falls.
   The order will virtually halt navigation along the channel,
which runs from Sioux City, Iowa, to St. Louis, said Chet Worm,
chief of the corps' reservoir regulation branch in Omaha, Neb.
Officials warned that power shortages also could result.
   The ruling was in response to a request by North Dakota, South
Dakota and Montana.
   Those states' governors said the order could help end disputes
over management of the drought-hit Missouri, at 2,540 miles the
longest river in the United States. But spokesmen for Govs. Terry
Branstad of Iowa and Kay Orr of Nebraska, two states downstream,
criticized it.
   ``The news is very alarming,'' said Orr's legal counsel, Bud
Cuca.
   Downstream states rely on the river for water for drinking,
cooling power plants and sustaining fish and wildlife populations
of their own, officials said.
   Conmy ordered the Corps of Engineers to maintain the reservoir
at its current level until June 1, when the lake's walleyed pike
hatch will have ended. South Dakota officials contend the hatch
would have been destroyed had the corps been allowed to proceed
with plans to lower the level by 3 feet this month.
   Lake Oahe spans both Dakotas and has a storage capacity of 23.3
million acre-feet, or enough water to put 23.3 million acres under
1 foot of water.
   The governors of Montana and the Dakotas contend the corps is
sacrificing millions of dollars' worth of recreation and fishing
interests in their states to provide enough water for shipping.
   The corps filed notice it would appeal Conmy's order, U.S.
Attorney Steve Easton said. But South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson
said the three states have already won.
   Even an expedited appeal is likely to take a few weeks,
Mickelson said. Before it is decided, ``we will have accomplished
most of what we set out to do,'' he said.
   ``There is justice after all, and this running battle has come
to a temporary halt, at least,'' North Dakota Gov. George Sinner
added. ``The water will stop flowing away from us, and we will stop
being washed down the river.''
   Attorneys for the corps argued the agency had balanced a number
of disparate needs in deciding how to manage the flow of water from
six upper Missouri dams.
   Sinner, Mickelson and Montana Gov. Stan Stephens said they
intended no long-term harm to states along the lower Missouri.
   ``My intention is to ... get them to sit down with us and
recognize the contemporary needs of all the states,'' Mickelson
said.
   Governors of the Missouri Basin states plan to discuss the
dispute next Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa, following a meeting by
the executive committee of the National Governors Association,
Branstad said.
   Charles Findlay, a Justice Department attorney representing the
corps, said it may have to reduce the Missouri's flow through
August due to Conmy's order, to avoid harming two rare birds that
nest near the river, the piping plover and the interior least tern.
   If that happens, electricity shortages could crop up downstream,
said Omaha Public Power District spokesman Mark Gautier.
   Barge owners worried Wednesday that they might not be able to
get their vessels off the river in time.
   ``We've got five barges up above Omaha right now,'' said Roger
Blaske, co-owner of Blaske Marine Inc. of Alton, Ill.
   Depending on how fast the river falls, the barges could be
stranded, Blaske said. ``I guess we'd just hang them up on a stump
somewhere and hope they're there next fall,'' he said.
   Missouri River marinas also could be put out of business as the
river drops an expected three feet as a result of the decision,
said John Ferrell, a corps spokesman in Omaha, Neb.
   But Sinner, Mickelson and other officials say upper basin states
have suffered virtually all the impact of a lingering drought
entering its third year in the upper Great Plains.
   ``It's the worst drought in this century, and there's going to
be losers,'' said former South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, the
lead attorney in the three states' lawsuit.
   ``The point we make is there shouldn't be any winners,'' Janklow
said. ``We should all suffer together.''

   Republicans, losing several votes on
amendments, abandoned efforts Wednesday night to stall Senate
action on a bill loosening restrictions on political activities by
government workers.
   GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas agreed to allow a vote late
Thursday on final passage of the wholesale revisions in the 1939
Hatch Act, which now forbids federal employees from participating
actively in partisan politics.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the Senate would
then proceed to consideration Friday of rival campaign finance
bills in the hope of finding a bipartisan compromise by the end of
next week.
   Mitchell, however, acknowledged tat a compromise will require
some backroom negotiations with Dole and others.
   In the meatime, he said, Democrats will try next week to pass a
bill authorizing $300 million a year in emergency aid for 13 cities
whose public health systems face collapse because of local AIDS
epidemics.
   The 13 cities are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los
Angeles, Miami, New York, Newark, N.J., Philadelphia, San
Francisco, Washington and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   Under the agreement on the bill to revise the Hatch Act,
Republicans may offer nine more amendments, including one by Dole
to continue the current restrictions on employees in intelligence
agencies, the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service and
the Federal Election Commission.
   A similar amendment by Dole was defeated 51-46 Tuesday.
   Earlier Wednesday, Democrats overwhelmingly beat back a
Republican effort to make federal employee unions refund part of
the dues paid by members who disgree with the organization's
political stands or endorsements.
   On a 63-35 vote, the Senate rejected an amendment by Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., to force the dues rebates as part of a bill
loosening restrictions on political activities by 3 million
government civil service and postal workers.
   McConnell said his amendment would remove for federal workers
the ``Hobson's choice'' of having to pick between getting out of a
union and losing their voice in collective bargaining or accepting
the use of a portion of their dues for political causes they don't
support.
   A similar measure is one of the main features of the GOP's
version of a campaign finance reform bill introduced Wednesday in
the Senate.
   Both seek to write into law and expand a 1988 Supreme Court
decision that workers who pay fees to labor organizations under
union shop agreements can demand a rebate of any portion of those
fees not devoted to collective bargaining.
   The bill, already approved in a broader form by the House, would
lift most of the current off-the-job restrictions on political
activities by government workers under the 51-year-old Hatch Act.
   Also defeated, on a 62-36 vote, was an amendment by Dole to let
workers in each federal agency decide by majority vote whether to
accept a loosening of the rules on their outside political
activites.
   The Senate spent more than a week on the legislation, with
majority Democrats joined by about a dozen Republicans rejecting a
series of amendments by the GOP leadership to maintain the
restrictions.
   President Bush's senior advisers have said they would urge him
to veto any change in the law as ``undermining the integrity and
independence of the traditionally non-partisan civil service.''
   George Gould, a lobbyist for the National Association of Letter
Carriers, said Wednesday the stream of amendments is an attempt by
GOP leaders to ``slow the process to give the White House time to
try to peel away votes.''
   Senate GOP Whip Alan Simpson admitted Republicans lack the 40
votes needed to maintain a filibuster against the bill. He said the
real test will come later when the White House asks Republican
leaders to scrape together the 34 votes needed to sustain a veto by
Bush.
   The House passed the bill by a veto-proof 297-90 majority in
April, 1989. With the support of 17 Senate Republicans, Democrats
in a test vote last week mustered a 70-28 majority _ also
sufficient for overriding a veto _ over the GOP leadership's
opposition to bring the bill to the Senate floor.
   The union-sought legislation would lift current restrictions
that prohibit federal workers from attending state and national
political conventions as delegates or holding other party office.
   The House version also would allow them to run for public office
and solicit campaign funds from the public, acts that would
continue to be prohibited under the Senate bill.
   McConnell's amendment would have required federal employee
unions to mail out notices annually to all 3 million government
employees, whether members of a union or not. The notices would
have to say that union members are entitled to a dues reduction
equal to a pro-rata share of what the organization spends on
political activities.

<HEAD>KGB May Have Played Role In Revolution, Commission Says</HEAD>

   The KGB may have played a role in
the peaceful revolution by influencing Czechoslovak security
forces, the state news agency CTK said Wednesday.
   The agency cited the sketchy findings of a parliamentary
commission investigating the Nov. 17 attack on protesting students,
an event that sparked the swift popular revolt against more than
four decades of Communist rule.
   According to CTK, the commission said it had been unable despite
six months of work to form a clear picture of events.
   ``The key to understanding the events of November 17 ... is
especially in the obviously illogical inactivity of the ministry of
Interior in the days that followed November 17,'' the commission
reported, according to CTK.
   ``State security did virtually nothing, although it had precise
reports on what was happening,'' the report continued. As quoted by
CTK, it hinted without specifics that some kind of a ``second
center'' existed inside the security forces and directed events.
   The report said the commission was ``so far unable to to expose
all culprits, identify the `second center,' those who directed the
events, and give the public a satisfactory explanation.''
   The report said Lt. Gen. Antonin Lorenz, considered a key figure
in the Interior Ministry, had dinner Nov. 17 with a man it
identified only as Groshko, a deputy chairman of the KGB and chief
of its counterintelligence.
   A KGB official reached by telephone in Moscow said Wednesday the
organization has a deputy chairman named Viktor Grushko.
   The report said Lorenz made some 20 phone calls during the
90-minute meal.
   It said Lorenz visited Moscow in August and September, where he
held talks with KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov and both his first
deputies. But it stressed the content of the talks was not known.
   Months before the uprising, rumors circulated in Prague hinting
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was dissatisfied with
the rigid Prague regime and pressing for more democratic change.
   Two days after the Nov. 17 beatings, dissidents established the
Civic Forum movement that eventually guided the revolution. Strikes
and street protests spread around the country by Nov. 20,
unhindered by police.
   Police allowed the dissidents, otherwise detained ``on every
significant anniversary, to establish in peace and quiet the Civic
Forum and overthrow the regime,'' the report said.
   By Nov. 24, the orthodox chief of the Communist Party, Milos
Jakes, and his Politburo allies had been ousted.
   Lorenz is currently in custody pending investigation of charges
that he abused the power of a public official.
   Miroslav Stepan, a former Prague Communist Party boss, is also
in custody pending results of a similar investigation.
   Stepan and Jakes have denied they ordered the attack Nov. 17.
   If found guilty, Stepan and Lorenz could spend up to 10 years
imprisonment.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The small claims agreement
announced Wednesday opens the way for settling about $16 billion in
claims that have been a major financial irritant between Iran and
the United States for 10 years, both nations agree.
   An American official and an Iranian official at the Iran-United
States Claims Tribunal in The Hague told The Associated Press the
settlement will speed resolution of the big cases.
   Settlement of the major cases could help re-establish economic
relations between the two nations, the American official said.
   The Iranian official denied, however, that better U.S.-Iran
economic ties would result.
   ``The economic relationship depends on the political
relationship,'' he said. ``If you don't have a good relationship in
the political sector, how can you have a good relationship in the
economic sector?''
   Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Government-to-government talks are expected to begin soon on
settlement of the Foreign Military Sales, or FMS, claim by Iran,
which the Tehran government has put at about $11 billion.
   The largest case before the tribunal, it deals with military
supplies ordered by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi before his overthrow
in the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Washington disputes Tehran's figure as exaggerated, claiming
that while some of the materiel is under U.S. embargo, much of it
was never paid for and is being held by U.S. contractors.
   The American official said once small claims are settled, the
tribunal will have more time for military equipment and oil claims.
   The nine-judge arbitration panel was established as part of the
1980 Algiers Accords, which gained freedom for the 52 Americans
held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants.
   The tribunal has presided over the settlement of more than $2.2
billion in financial disputes stemming from the Iranian revolution,
resulting expropriations and broken contracts.
   The oil expropriation claims, filed by the American oil giants
Amoco, Arco and Sun, and by consortiums of smaller firms, total
about $5 billion.
   ``A key to their (Iran's) economic recovery is settling all of
them,'' the American official said.
   ``Settlement of these cases, particularly if they entailed a
softening of U.S. import restrictions on Iranian oil, would reflect
and accelerate a thawing.''
   A reopening of the U.S. oil market to Iran is considered vital
to the Iranians, who depend on oil exports for about 90 percent of
their foreign exchange earnings.
   ``They're desperate for hard currency,'' said the American
official.
   The small claims talks have been held almost monthly between the
State Department's chief legal adviser, Judge Abraham Sofaer, and
Iran's Jaromi Eftekhar.
   Sofaer is due to resign from his State Department position next
month and the American tribunal official said Sofaer is expected to
begin settlement talks before then with Iran on the FMS claim,
known as B1.
   ``Without the small claims, the tribunal will have more
resources to devote to B1 and the oil claims,'' said the American.
   A more speculative question is whether resolution of the
military equipment and oil cases could provide the goodwill gesture
sought by Tehran in response to the recent release of American
hostages Robert Polhill and Frank Reed, who were held by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon.
   The American official and Iran have denied any link between
agreement on small claims and the release.
   Resolution of the FMS and oil cases would allow the Tribunal to
shut down after almost a decade as the only official forum between
Iran and the United States, which broke off diplomatic relations
following the 1979 hostage-taking.
   ``If we do all the things necessary to close it down, doors will
have been opened in the process,'' said the American tribunal
official.
   ``It would result in improved good will.''

   U.S. officials allowed American
troops to leave their bases Wednesday for the first time since the
weekend slaying of a Marine, and U.S. diplomats began changing
license plates to prevent identification by insurgents.
   Also Wednesday, prosecutors ordered police to release three
suspects in the killing of Gunnery Sgt. John Fredette, 34, saying
the arrests were flawed and evidence linking the men to the slaying
was insufficient.
   Police have refused to obey the court order pending approval
from the chief of police and the mayor, officials said.
   Assistant prosecutor Dorentino Floresca said his ruling does not
absolve the three in the slaying of Fredette but added that
evidence presented by the police against them is ``not convincing.''
   He ordered police to submit additional evidence against the
suspects within five working days.
   On Tuesday, police Lt. Col. Macarthur Torres said Renato
Angeles, 38, a former Subic base worker, confessed to having
accidentally killed Fredette in a robbery attempt. But on Wednesday
Angeles denied he made such a confession.
   Police earlier speculated Fredette was shot by Communist rebels,
who have threatened to kill American service members.
   Angeles and two other men were arrested earlier this week.
   Adm. Roger Rich, senior U.S. military commander in the
Philippines, banned off-post leaves Saturday after Fredette was
murdered near the Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles west of Manila.
   In a statement Wednesday, the U.S. military said the 40,000 U.S.
troops, Defense Department civilians and military dependents would
be allowed to leave the six American installations effective
immediately but must return between midnight and 5:30 a.m.
   Americans who do not live on the bases must return to their
homes during the curfew period, the statement said.
   ``In view of the current situation and continuing, potential
threats against U.S. military and military-associated personnel, a
curfew from midnight to 5:30 for all U.S. military personnel at all
military installations in the Republic of the Philippines has been
instituted,'' the statement said.
   The order applies to troops at Subic Base, Clark Air Base and
the four smaller U.S.-run installations. Local communities near the
bases depend heavily on spending by American service members.
   Despite the relaxation, U.S. officials said they remained
concerned that the Marxist New People's Army may try to kill
Americans before talks begin Monday on extending the lease on the
bases. The lease expires in September 1991 and the Marxist rebels
have demanded the expulsion of U.S. troops from the Philippines.
   On Wednesday, sources in the American community said the U.S.
Embassy ordered diplomats to replace their distinctive, diplomatic
license tags with regular car plates.
   American diplomats have already been varying their routes to
work and staggering office hours to reduce the possibility of an
ambush. The State Department also is considering increasing
hazardous duty pay for embassy employees.

<HEAD>Alaska Legislature Passes Several Oil-Spill Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY PERSILY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One legacy of the Exxon Valdez disaster
has been several ``spill bills'' to strengthen Alaska's pollution
laws, but two tough anti-spill measures have run aground on
legislative shoals.
   Gov. Steve Cowper said Wednesday he was pleased with the bills
that passed before Tuesday night's adjournment deadline, but he
said the oil industry had played a major role in preventing
stronger bills from passing.
   ``They weakened the legislation that passed and they probably
were instrumental in stopping the bills that didn't get through,''
Cowper said.
   The Democratic-controlled House sent six oil-spill bills to the
Republican-led Senate, which killed a major enforcement bill. House
Republicans, meanwhile, stopped the only Senate-passed bill in
their chamber.
   In addition, some provisions on bills that passed were weakened
by the Legislature, Cowper said.
   Nonetheless, he said, state, industry and federal government
measures since the spill will help prevent another disaster like
the Exxon Valdez, the worst oil spill in the nation's history.
   The tanker struck a charted reef on March 24, 1989, and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude in the hitherto
pristine waters of Prince William Sound.
   Walt Parker, chairman of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission which
investigated the Exxon Valdez disaster, said the oil industry's
``massive lobbying presence'' against the bills was understandable.
   ``It is their No. 1 priority to have no state involvement in the
oil transportation system,'' Parker said.
   A House bill that would set strict standards for oil-industry
cleanup plans, including a 72-hour requirement for response to
major spills, had to wait until the final hours of the session
before winning Senate approval.
   ``It's not a performance standard, it's a planning standard,''
said Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   The measure also requires companies either to prove they can pay
spill cleanup costs or risk a state shutdown of their operations.
Although revamped in Senate committee, ``The bill is still worth
having,'' Kelso said.
   A tough enforcement and inspection bill died in the Senate
Resources Committee when the session adjourned.
   The original bill would have let the Department of Environmental
Conservation order companies to pay for independent audits of
pollution problems. The Senate version said companies could refuse
the state's request.
   The Senate Judiciary panel removed a provision allowing
warrantless searches of suspected polluters, replacing it with a
plan allowing such searches only if agreed on as part of the
company's operating permit.
   The bill also was changed to give companies more time to obey
state compliance orders for correcting violations of environmental
laws.
   House Republicans blocked passage of a Senate bill that would
have increased municipal access to the state's oil-spill fund,
which is financed by a 5-cent-a-barrel tax on Alaska oil production.
   The new tax was instituted last year as an immediate response to
the tanker accident, and the bill would have increased municipal
access to the fund for cleanup and other emergency costs.
   Other bills that won legislative approval and were sent to the
governor include measures that would:
   _ increase criminal penalties for negligent operation of oil
tankers.
   _ establish a citizens' oversight council on oil and other
hazardous substances.
   _ establish state management plans for oil-spill response
efforts.
   _ increase corporate fines for negligence in oil spills and
other crimes.

<HEAD>At Least 8 Arrested at Pro-Democracy Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least eight opposition figures have been
arrested at a pro-democracy meeting, and the Interior Ministry said
Wednesday that they have been detained for attending an illegal
gathering.
   Former members of Kuwait's parliament, apparently stepping up
their campaign for broader representation in the oil-rich Persian
Gulf monarchy, claimed 20 arrests from a packed meeting house
Tuesday.
   The fully elected Parliament was dissolved in 1986 and replaced
by an transitional National Council, in which 25 of its 75 members
are appointed.
   The opposition bloc, which includes 32 of the previous
Parliament's 50 members, is pressing to cancel elections for the
4-year-old council and restore the fully elected house.
   The crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad Abdullah Sabah,
had warned against using the meeting halls, known as diwaniyas, for
political rallies ahead of the council elections set for June 10.
   ``Accordingly, security men were obliged to apply the law and
disperse an illegal rally Tuesday night ... after the owner failed
to respond to the security men's order to disperse the meeting,''
an Interior Ministry statement said.
   Eight people were arrested ``when they tried to impede security
men carrying out their duty,'' it said.
   ``Those arrested are being interrogated as a prelude for
referring them to the public prosecution to decide what measures
should be taken against them.''
   The arrests took place as registration of candidates running in
the June election was drawing to a close. The official Kuwait news
agency announced 567 candidates registered by the filing deadline
on Wednesday.
   The opposition group of 32 had declared a boycott of the
election campaign.
   The government insisted it needed a transitional period to find
the means to limit the criticism the parliamentarians used to
direct at government ministers.
   Government officials have said the elected Parliament, outlined
in the constitution, will be restored eventually.

<TEXT>
   An investigating team from Antigua questioned
Israeli reserve Col. Yair Klein about a shipment of Israeli arms to
the Caribbean island that instead was diverted to a Colombian drug
lord, Klein's attorney said Wednesday.
   Attorney Yigal Shapiro said the four Antiguan investigators
spent hours over inner talking with Klein, and added it was
unlikely he would be questioned further.
   ``From our point of view, the answers given by the government of
Israel clear us, and I don't think it is necessary (to meet
again),'' he said
   The Antiguans, headed by the U.N. diplomat Patrick Lewis, were
given a file of 53 documents by Foreign Ministry officials on
Tuesday.
   The file included an end-user certificate bearing the signature
of Vere Bird Jr., Antigua's top defense official, assuring Israel
the arms would be used exclusively by the island's military and not
sent on to a third country.
   A ministry official, demanding anonymity, said the Israelis
asked the Antiguans ``some hard questions on how the end-use
agreement was violated.''
   The delegation is also expected to meet with the captain of the
ship that carried the weapons to Antigua and a military officer who
accompanied the arms.
   Shapiro said Klein had no information on how the arms got to
Colombia and that the Antiguans gave no sign they planned to take
legal steps against Klein.
   The New York Times identified Klein and Maurice Sarfati, an
Israeli who was a businessman in Antigua, as the men responsible
for the arms diversion.
   Colombian officials said Klein is wanted for organizing,
training, and equipping paramilitary groups.
   Klein said earlier the weapons were paid for by Panamanian
exiles and intended for a military training camp set up in Antigua
for Panamanian rebels opposed to Manuel Noriega, the country's de
facto leader now deposed and awaiting trial on drug charges in
Florida.
   After plans for the camp fell through, Klein said the
Panamanians wanted the arms shipped to Panama but they wound up in
the hands of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a drug boss killed by
Colombian police last December.
   Israel television said Sarfati, acting as special envoy for
Antigua, came to Israel and arranged for a ship from Ashdod to
carry a 10-ton container marked ``dangerous material'' which
contained Israeli-made weapons and rockets.
   The vessel sailed for Antigua under a Panamanian flag. The cargo
was supposed to be transferred to a ship named Sea Point which was
bound for Panama, but instead continued on to Colombia, the TV said.
   The TV said the Antiguans planned to meet the captain.
   The Jerusalem Post identified the ship as the Else PH, owned by
Svendbog Enterprises of Denmark, and said it sailed from Haifa on
March 28, 1989, bound for Chile. It arrived in Antigua on April 24.

<HEAD>Judge: Resources to Be Split Equally Between Indians, Non-Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL C. BUELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who once granted Chippewa Indians
100 percent of the fish caught in northern Wisconsin ruled
Wednesday that the region's ``harvestable natural resources''
should be divided 50-50 between Indians and non-Indians.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb's decision, which came in a
case that set parameters for deer hunting, has sweeping
implications that limit the tribe's right to half the available
fish and timber in northern Wisconsin, lawyers said.
   Under treaties that ceded the northern third of the state to the
United States in the 19th century, Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands
retain the right to spearfish, hunt and cut timber off-reservation
on public lands in the region.
   Since a court affirmed the treaties in 1983, the Chippewa have
exercised their spearfishing rights on northern lakes, encountering
huge and sometimes violent protests by opponents who claim the
special treaty rights are unfair and threaten to deplete fish and
timber resources.
   Wednesday's decision contrasts with Mrs. Crabb's previous ruling
that the Chippewa are entitled to 100 percent of the ``safe
allowable'' catch of fish in the 23,929 square miles of territory
ceded in the 19th century.
   State lawyers said the new ruling essentially alters the
previous decision.
   ``It's our understanding of this decision that it does not apply
only to deer, but that it applies to all natural resources,''
Attorney General Donald Hanaway said. ``And I think that's
extremely significant.''
   Mrs. Crabb's office said the judge would not further interpret
her intentions beyond what was stated in her 74-page decision.
   Since the 1983 court ruling, the Chippewa bands have filed a
series of lawsuits asking the court to define how much of the
resources of northern Wisconsin they are entitled to under the
treaties and to what degree the state can regulate tribal
activities.
   Tribal attorneys declined immediate comment on the ruling. But
Tom Maulson, a Lac du Flambeau Chippewa spearfishing coordinator
and a leader in the treaty rights group Wa-Swa-Gon Treaty
Association, said the philosophy of sharing the resource has been
supported by the tribe for years.
   Maulson said the split in allocation of resources did not
unfairly deprive the Chippewa of their rights.
   ``I bet the tribe will never touch 50 percent,'' he said. ``We
say the resource is for everybody. Maybe they'll start to realize
that what we've wanted all along.''
   Administration Secretary James Klauser, the top aide to Gov.
Tommy G. Thompson, said Wednesday's ruling was significant because
it recognizes ``the non-Indian right to the resources.
   ``The important findings are that the treaty provisions only
apply to public lands and the state has regulatory authority for
the hunting seasons,'' he added.
   The leader of an anti-treaty group said the latest ruling
wouldn't anger non-Indians and could lead to a solution to tensions
over tribal rights.
   ``I think she's beginning to open the door to cooperation, to
open the door for settlement between all parties,'' said Larry
Peterson of the Protect Americans' Rights and Resources.
   The judge said she was setting the deer limit for the Chippewa
at 50 percent of the estimated population based on the tribe's
``needs for a moderate standard of living'' and to ``prevent the
frustration of the non-Indian treaty right.''

<HEAD>Socialist Government Survives No-Confidence Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialist government narrowly defeated a
no-confidence motion introduced after a politician was granted
amnesty under a widely unpopular law that had been sponsored by the
governing party.
   Only 262 deputies voted for the motion, 27 short of the majority
needed in the 577-seat National Assembly.
   If the motion had succeeded, Premier Michel Rocard's government
would have been forced to resign, leaving President Francois
Mitterrand to name a new prime minister or call legislative
elections.
   It was the fifth failed no-confidence motion since Mitterrand
was re-elected in 1988.
   The assembly passed the Socialist-proposed amnesty bill in
December, with all Communist deputies and many rightists voting
against it.
   The amnesty came as politicians and newspapers began reporting
that kickbacks on public contracts had become a major source of
funding for nearly all the established parties.
   The opposition says it understood the amnesty law would protect
contributors but exclude members of the assembly.
   They claim the government misrepresented the bill and were
especially angered when former Cooperation Minister Christian Nucci
received amnesty in the financial scandal.
   The amnesty has contributed to Mitterrand's decline in public
opinion polls. Only 39 percent of French citizens expressing
approval with his performance in a recent newspaper survey.

   The Navy's decision to let two gay ROTC cadets
keep their scholarships could signal hope that a Pentagon policy
barring homosexuals from the armed services might one day be
abolished, activists said Wednesday.
   ``I think the military realizes that it needs to change and is
fully working towards it,'' said discharged cadet Robert Bettiker,
a chemistry major at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The Navy had ordered Bettiker and all other ROTC cadets who are
homosexuals to reimburse the government for all tuition payments.
   But this week, Bettiker and another discharged cadet, Harvard
University graduate David Carney, received letters from the Navy
exempting them from the tuition demand. The Navy had been seeking
$38,612 in tuition from Bettiker and $50,687 from Carney.
   ``I'm not exactly sure what it all means,'' Bettiker said. ``My
lawyer and I will talk and see how this will help other people. I'm
willing to do my part.''
   Bettiker, 22, had wanted to enter the Navy's Nuclear Propulsion
Program, but has instead decided to work at a cancer research
laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley after
graduation.
   Carney, 23, is working toward a masters degree in management at
Templeton College in Oxford, England. While in the reserve corps,
he was working toward a submarine assignment as a nuclear engineer.
   Navy Lt. Greg Smith said ``there was no real information
provided'' about the Navy's about-face, but said the decision was
related only to the Cambridge students' cases.
   The decision ``was handed down on a personal review of the cases
that were involved and the Navy elected in these instances to not
require them to repay the money,'' Smith said in a telephone
interview from Washington, D.C.
   Smith said Bettiker and Carney were so far the only two former
cadets to receive such a dispensation. He said the decision would
not exempt them from the broader Pentagon policy barring
homosexuals from ROTC and military service.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who is gay, complained in a letter
to Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III that he had learned of a
third homosexual naval ROTC cadet from whom the Navy was seeking
repayment.
   Studds released his letter but declined to identify the cadet.
   ``Must I look forward to hearing from midshipman after
midshipman who has been ordered to repay funds which _ as the Navy
acknowledged with regard to Carney and Bettiker _ he should not be
required to pay?'' Studds wrote.
   The Defense Department issued a statement in March saying it
views homosexuality as ``incompatible with military service'' for
reasons of morale, discipline and security.
   Carney said that while he disagrees with the policy, he harbored
no animosity about being rejected from the ROTC.
   ``I don't like the fact that an institution in our American
society had this particular policy. But that policy does not make
the Navy an institution filled with evil people,'' Carney said in a
telephone interview from England.
   Mary Bonauto, Bettiker's lawyer, welcomed the Navy's decision
but said she was ``looking at it as a crack in a very large wall.''
   ``They haven't changed their policy, they simply made an
exemption,'' she said.
   James Holobaugh, a former Army ROTC member at Washington
University in St. Louis, was awaiting word on a similar appeal.
   Holobaugh, 24, was due to receive his Army commission last May.
But after informing his superiors that he had come to the
realization that he was gay, an Army professor recommended the
cadet be denied commission and be ordered to pay back $25,000 in
scholarship money.
   ``I think it's nice that the Navy admitted that it's wrong for
going after the money,'' said Holobaugh, who is enrolled at the
University of New Haven in Connecticut. ``But the money is not the
issue here.''
   Army spokesman Maj. Joseph L. Allred said the Army would
consider appeals on a case-by-case basis and would not be swayed by
the Navy's recent decisions regarding Bettiker and Carney.

<TEXT>
   The rain-bloated Arkansas River reached
its highest level in 37 years Wednesday in flooding that put more
than 500 homes under water and has drowned or trapped hundreds of
cattle, officials said.
   The river began slowly receding after cresting Wednesday morning
at 47.5 feet at Pine Bluff about 40 miles southeast of Little Rock,
the highest it's been since reaching 52.1 feet in 1943, the
National Weather Service said.
   Floods that swamped Texas and Oklahoma as well as Arkansas began
late last week following heavy rains. Rains and flooding have
claimed 12 lives in Texas and one in Oklahoma, but none in
Arkansas, officials said.
   In Texas, where 4,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by
flooding, up to 400 volunteers, National Guard soldiers and
officials patrolled levees near the Arkansas line that threatened
to give way on the swollen Red River.
   Residents of flooded sections of Dallas tried to save what they
could from homes under several feet of water. Others began cleaning
up.
   Several hundred homes were flooded in Oklahoma, but ``the waters
are starting to go down,'' said Civil Defense spokesman Richard
Hill. ``There's still a lot of places we can't physically reach.''
   In Arkansas, about 300 homes in Jefferson County, which includes
Pine Bluff, were flooded Wednesday, and more than 200 homes were
underwater along the river from that county to Fort Smith on the
Oklahoma line, authorities said. About 16,000 sandbags were sent to
Jefferson County.
   Officials say it's difficult to estimate the number of people
evacuated, because most are staying with friends or relatives
rather than at emergency shelters.
   About 400 cattle were missing from herds along the river basin
and were believed to have drowned, said Arkansas Cattlemen's
Association President Walt Rowden.
   Officials continue to watch the weather, said Army Corps of
Engineers spokesman Ron Helton.
   ``Our biggest concern now is ... rain,'' Helton said. ``Our
lakes are full and they can't handle any more water, so it will
have to come down river.''
   The White House may declare Arkansas a federal disaster area
later this week, state and federal officials said at a news
conference at Little Rock's Riverfront Park as the river rolled by
at 440,000 cubic feet per second.
   People could begin receiving federal assistance as early as
Monday if the declaration is signed before the weekend, said Joe
Brady, operations supervisor for the state Office of Emergency
Services.
   No firm estimates on damage were available, officials said.
Brady estimated damage to roads and bridges at about $10 million,
but said that figure is expected to escalate.
   ``There's no way to get precise counts'' until the water
recedes, he said.
   The floods have caused millions of dollars' worth of damage to
farmers. In Jefferson County alone, the flooding is expected to
cause an estimated $20 million in damages, including reduced rice
and cotton crops, said Frank Plafcan of the county extension office.
   Direct losses to cattle ranchers across the river basin are
expected to top $250,000, and expected higher feed costs due to hay
and alfalfa crops now underwater will add to ranchers' woes, Rowden
said.
   Bradley Harris, regional director for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, said he expects state emergency officials,
assisted by FEMA personnel, to complete preliminary damage surveys
by Thursday or Friday. That information will be forwarded to the
White House.
   In another development, corps officials continued to discount
complaints the flooding was worse because of mismanagement along
the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System.
   Buddy Dyke of Swan Lake, where about 35 families have been
forced to leave their homes, complained about misinformation from
the corps.
   ``They said it was going to crest on Monday, then Tuesday, then
Wednesday, then in Pine Bluff on Thursday,'' said Buddy Dyke of
Swan Lake, where about 35 families have been forced to leave their
homes. ``It'll probably be here on Friday.''
   He said the river rose several feet higher than residents were
told to expect. Cut off from land, they didn't have time to move
out valuables.
   Col. Charles McCloskey with the Little Rock district of the Army
Engineers said in Little Rock that water would have been higher in
most places without the navigation system, and said the system
worked like it was supposed to.
   P.J. Spaul, another corps spokesman, said earlier this week that
flood damage would have been three to four times greater without
the levee system. The reservoir system in Oklahoma prevented
another $10.5 million in damages in Arkansas, he said.
   Among those with trapped cattle was state Rep. Lloyd George of
Danville, who has about 150 head stranded on 40 dry acres on a
2,000-acre pasture.
   ``Obviously, that's not enough for them to feed on,'' said
George, who's paying $100 a day to feed cattle that otherwise would
graze.
   ``I'm concerned about these cattle,'' he said. ``If I have to
keep feeding them it gets expensive.''

   Sen. Richard Lugar and Rep. Henry Hyde said
Wednesday they have no recollection of discussions about assisting
the Contras which turned up in newly released portions of Oliver
North's notebooks.
   In a March 4, 1985 meeting about the Contras, Hyde, R-Ill.,
brought up ``private efforts, 3rd countries _ Taiwan, Saudi
Arabia,'' according to an entry on one of 1,400 pages of North's
notebooks.
   In 1985 during a U.S. military aid ban to the Contras, Saudi
Arabia was providing them with $1 million a month. Taiwan
contributed $1 million to the rebel force in mid-1985.
   Hyde says he didn't know anything about the Saudi contributions
at the time. Assuming North's notes are correct, Hyde said he
probably suggested Taiwan and Saudi Arabia as possible donors
because they were anti-communist.
   North's notes say the comments came in a meeting about the
Contras between national security adviser Robert McFarlane and four
congressmen. McFarlane had arranged the Saudi contributions in 1984.
   Hyde, a staunch backer of the Reagan administration in the
Iran-Contra affair, said ``I may have'' suggested third-country
contributions on other occasions, but had ``no inkling'' that they
were actually occurring until the congressional hearings into the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Lugar, R-Ind., was told by Contra leader Adolfo Calero and
national security adviser John Poindexter about Ilopango air base,
a key link in the Contra resupply operation, according to North's
notebook.
   ``Calero-JMP _ both told Lugar that Ilopango was active,'' says
a Jan. 9, 1986 entry.
   Lugar has ``no recollection'' of being told such information,
said his press secretary, David Shapiro. Lugar has said he was
unaware in 1985 and 1986 of the arming of the Contras in
contravention of the Boland Amendment restrictions.
   Meanwhile, the White House declined to make any substantive
comment about a newly disclosed entry suggesting North met with
President Bush on Aug. 6, 1986, the day the vice president returned
from a trip to the Middle East.
   The apparent North-Bush meeting occurred a few hours after the
White House aide lied to the House intelligence committee by
denying he was offering military advice to the Contras. In
connection with Iran, North received a call that day from Amiram
Nir, the main Israeli contact regarding arms sales to Iran. Three
days earlier, 240 spare parts for Hawk missiles had been delivered
to Iran.
   Bush has said he didn't learn the full details of the Iran
initiative until Dec. 20, 1986. But on July 29, 1986 during his
Mideast trip, he met with Nir in Jerusalem and was briefed on it.
Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller took notes saying that ``we are
dealing with the most radical elements'' in Iran.
   ``The various committees, both congressional and independent
counsel, have looked at all these matters and we don't have
anything to add beyond that,'' said White House spokesman Roman
Popadiuk.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., suggested Tuesday that the page of
North's notebooks pointing to a meeting with Bush apparently wasn't
turned over to Congress.
   ``I don't know which parts were or were not made available to
the Congress,'' said the White House spokesman. ``But I know that
basically the independent counsel and the congressional
investigating committees have been provided all kinds of material
including North's materials, so ... we will not comment on it.''
   North's other notebook entries for the morning of Aug. 6, 1986
referred to conversations with others in the U.S. government,
including Elliott Abrams, then assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, and Col. James Steele, a U.S. military
adviser in El Salvador, as well as then-Associated Press Washington
bureau chief Charles J. Lewis.
   Terry Anderson, the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, is one
of the U.S. hostages. North directed the Reagan administration's
efforts to win release of hostages by selling arms to Iran and was
the National Security Council staff member in charge of hostage
matters.
   North also met about a month later with AP President Louis D.
Boccardi to discuss Anderson's situation, according to notes
supplied to a special presidential commission that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair.

   A jury Wednesday found a man guilty of
trying to poison the historic Treaty Oak, a centuries-old tree that
was severely damaged by the powerful herbicide Velpar.
   Paul Stedman Cullen, 46, faces a possible life sentence because
of a prior conviction. He has been jailed since his arrest in June
1989. State District Judge Bob Perkins scheduled the sentencing
phase of the trial for Thursday.
   Cullen stood expressionless as the verdict was read after about
three and one-half hours of deliberation. He refused to comment as
he was led from the courtroom.
   Prosecutors contended that Cullen used the powerful herbicide
Velpar to poison the centuries-old live oak tree in a ritual
apparently designed to end his affection for his counselor at a
methadone clinic.
   Legend has it that the giant live oak, estimated to be at least
500 years old, was the site of a treaty signing between Stephen F.
Austin and Indians during the 1820s.
   Prosecutors during the 1{-week trial produced a tape recording
in which Cullen told Cindy Blaco he had killed the tree, adding,
``The only evidence is my mouth.''
   Cullen's defense lawyers said Cullen was lying to try to impress
Ms. Blaco, who secretly taped the conversation for police.
   They contended that Ms. Blaco may have been testifying to
collect more than $11,000 in rewards. The defense also called
witnesses who said Cullen wasn't interested in the occult but was
prone to telling outrageous lies.
   Ms. Blaco testified that during February 1989, when experts
believe the tree was poisoned, Cullen had several books on
witchcraft and the occult. She also testified that she saw two
containers of Velpar in the back of Cullen's truck that month.
   Since the poisoning was discovered last Memorial Day, more than
$100,000 has been donated as city foresters and outside experts
have taken extraordinary measures to save the tree.
   Velpar-contaminated earth was removed from around its roots, the
tree has been doused with spring water and shaded by elaborate sun
screens. But foresters say at least half the oak is dead.
   News reports about the tree's plight have brought visitors and
get-well messages from around the world.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, speaking to an
audience of Mexico's wealthiest businessmen, assailed the idea that
capitalism has beaten socialism and said Wednesday that Mexico is
``still very far from the ideal of justice.''
   He said the poor had suffered the worst consequences of Mexico's
economic crisis and accused the small, powerful upper-class of
generating even more poverty.
   ``The events of recent history ... have been interpreted,
sometimes in a superficial way ... as the triumph of the liberal
capitalist system,'' John Paul said in a speech in Durango, a
provincial capital 450 miles northwest of Mexico City.
   ``Some interests would like to take the analysis to the extreme
of presenting the system they consider the `winner' as the only way
for our world.'' But he said that conclusion avoids ``the necessary
critical judgment about the effects that liberal capitalism has
produced ... in the so-called Third World countries.''
   On the fourth day of his trip here, the pope earlier Wednesday
visited a state prison and spent 20 minutes greeting and blessing
inmates, including murderers and drug traffickers.
   Wednesday evening, the pope ordained 100 new priests during a
Mass in a local plaza attended by 200,000 people. The novices
prostrated themselves as the pope prayed, then knelt before John
Paul one by one as he placed his hands on their shoulders to
indicate the transmission of the spirit of God.
   His message to Latin America's business people also appeared
aimed at U.S. officials and intellectuals who have pushed the idea
that Western capitalism beat communism with the upheaval in Eastern
Europe.
   It was the Polish-born pontiff's strongest warning yet not to
gloat over communism's decline and not to ignore the problems of
materialism and poverty.
   John Paul used the economic situation in this nation of 85
million people as an example of the failings of capitalism.
   ``The last few years have seen the deterioration of buying
power, and phenomena typical of the organization of the economy,
such as inflation, have produced painful effects at all levels,''
he said.
   ``It is necessary to repeat once again: it is always the weakest
who suffer the worst consequences, because they see themselves
closed in a spiral of growing poverty.''
   Mexico's economic crisis exploded in 1982 due to overborrowing
and plunging prices for crude oil, the country's main export. The
average Mexican's buying power was cut in half between 1982 and
1988.
   Mexico, ``despite the inherent resources that the Creator gave
this country, is still very far from the ideal of justice,'' the
pope said before noting the vast contrast between the rich few and
the poor majority.
   He said foreign creditors were not the only cause of Mexico's
economic problems.
   The pontiff said that by taking too big a share of the country's
resources, the very wealthy accumulated a ``wealth that is a
generator of poverty'' for others.
   John Paul asked business leaders in overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Mexico to create more jobs, pay proper salaries and
protect the environment.
   He said the economic interests of capitalism often ``fomented
the consumer culture'' of consumerism and materialism. Those same
interests also sometimes instigated ``campaigns against natality,''
he said _ a reference to those who support artificial means of
lowering the birthrate.
   Gen. Agustin Vallejo Alvarez meanwhile said he had no evidence
to substantiate Mexican press reports that Japanese Red Army
terrorists were stalking the pope.
   ``That's journalistic rumor,'' said Vallejo, commander of the
10th military region headquartered in Durango. ``We don't have any
special alert.''
   At the prison, John Paul urged prisoners not to lose hope
because ``Christ never loses hope in his creatures.''
   ``The worst prison would be a closed and hardened heart,'' he
said.
   He broke schedule to wade into a crowded prison yard as a
convict chorus sang Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy.''
   He was supposed to greet one prisoner _ a man who killed his
wife. But John Paul ordered a gate opened and strolled into the
yard, greeting and blessing prisoners for 20 minutes.

   An earthquake registering 4.5 on the
Richter scale rocked parts of Western Australia state on Wednesday,
scientists said. There were no immediate reports of damage or
injuries.
   The Bureau of Mineral Resources said the earthquake's epicenter
was 110 miles northeast of the state capital of Perth, between the
towns of Miling and Ballidu.
   A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in populated
areas; a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.
   Residents of the farming community of Cadoux, 124 miles north of
Perth, said buildings shook and there was a loud rumbling noise.
The quake struck at about 2.45 a.m. (12:45 p.m. EDT Tuesday).
   On Dec. 28, 1989, a quake measuring 5.5 killed 12 people and
caused widespread damage in the northern coastal city of Newcastle.

   Rebels attacked a police headquarters to
try to seize arms for a guerrilla campaign, and 12 people were
killed, President Ali Saibou said Tuesday.
   He said six rebels, three security force members and three
civilians died in the attack, which occurred Monday at
Tchintabaraden, 642 miles northeast of Niamey.
   The rebels seized six weapons before security forces put down
the assault and arrested several attackers, Saibou said. Among
those arrested was Mohamed Adullahi, former minister of public and
semi-public corporations.
   The rebels claimed membership in the Revolutionary Movement for
the Liberation of Niger, an organization the government says is
backed by Libya.
   Saibou told deputies in the national assembly the rebels planned
to use the weapons for attacks on government facilities, including
the uranium mining center at Arlit, the main foreign-exchange
earner for the impoverished Sahel nation. Arlit is about 240 miles
northeast of Tchintabaraden.

   A Vietnamese refugee was
sentenced Tuesday to 21 months in prison for negligence in the
drownings of two Malaysian women he was attempting to smuggle
across the Niagara River into the United States.
   Ba Minh Hoang, 28, of Niagara Falls, Ontario, was transporting
the women across the river aboard a flimsy raft in December 1988
when it capsized in icy, turbulent water.
   Hoang swam to shore but Vasugee Krighan, 27, and Fong Yew Cheah,
38, drowned. Both women were illegal immigrants.
   Hoang pleaded guilty in April to two charges of criminal
negligence in the deaths and to charges of conspiracy to violate
U.S. immigration laws.
   He was sentenced Tuesday by provincial court Judge Harry
Edmondstone to 21 months for each charge of criminal negligence,
and 12 months for conspiracy. The sentences are to be served
concurrently.
   Hoang was paid for his part in the smuggling operation, but the
amount was not disclosed in court.
   Government attorney Barry Hill said Hoang recklessly endangered
the lives of the immigrants by crossing the river aboard a
three-person, $60 raft that was ``more suitable for a backyard
swimming pool'' than the currents and whirlpools of the lower
Niagara River.
   Defense Attorney Larry O'Brien argued that his client's motive
was a ``belief he was helping refugees better their lives.''

   The guided-missile destroyer USS Conyngham
limped back to port under tow Tuesday after a boiler fire spread to
its nerve center, killing the ship's operation officer and injuring
12 others, officials said.
   In a second fatal Navy accident Tuesday, a crew member aboard an
air-cushioned landing vessel off the East Coast was killed when a
propeller malfunctioned. It was the latest accident since a series
of problems forced a worldwide Navy stand-down last fall.
   The fire on the 27-year-old Conyngham started around 5:30 a.m.
while it was on routine operations about 100 miles southeast of
Norfolk, where it is based, said Lt. Cmdr. Carrie Hartshorne, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
   The blaze broke out in the No. 1 boiler room when the boiler was
fired up, according to White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The fire spread to the combat information center spaces, which
caused the captain to evacuate the combat information center and
the bridge, temporarily leaving the ship without communications and
dead in the water,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Combat Information Center contains all of the ship's
communications equipment plus sonar and radar and is considered the
ship's nerve center.
   The Norfolk-based ship, whose skipper is Cmdr. W.R. Williams,
has a crew of 383.
   The main fire was put out after about 2{ hours and the crew
battled smaller secondary fires through the morning.
   Atlantic fleet officials said the Conyngham was able to move
under its own power en route to Norfolk at about 3 mph until
midday, when it lost power about 60 miles east of Norfolk. It was
then taken under tow by the salvage ship USS Opportune.
   Navy officials were unable to say when the Conyngham would reach
its homeport.
   The guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy, the Briscoe and Coast
Guard cutters Point Arena, Gentian and Forward also assisted the
Conyngham, said Capt. Paul Hanley, a spokesman for the fleet.
   The Navy identified the dead man as Lt. Algernon Pope Gordon
Jr., 34, of Montgomery, Ala. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Bankruptcy
Cort in Montgomery said the victim was the son of a U.S. bankruptcy
judge there. The spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified, said
Gordon was married with three children.
   Gordon was assigned to the Conyngham in July 1989 and was the
ship's operations officer, said Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Rep.
Bill Dickinson of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the House
Armed Services Committee.
   Lewis said Gordon had joined the Navy after graduating from the
University of Alabama and worked as a recruiting officer in
Montgomery from 1984-86.
   The 12 injured sailors were flown by helicopter to hospitals.
   Three sailors initially taken to Sentara Norfolk General
Hospital Trauma Unit were transferred to the Portsmouth Naval
Hospital to join the others. Three were in guarded condition and
the rest listed as satisfactory, the Navy said. The Navy said nine
had burns and three suffered smoke inhalation.
   The Navy identified the injured as: Lt. Cmdr. Martin Moody of
Indian Head, Md., the ship's executive officer; Lt. j.g. Oscar
Dansby of Atlanta; Lt. j.g. John Beaver of Falls Church, Va.; Petty
Officer 1st Class Joseph Sanchez of Seguin, Texas; Petty Officer
1st Class Timothy McCauley of Thomasville, N.C.; Petty Officer 3rd
Class Joseph Hoff of Kingsport, Tenn.; and Petty Officer 3rd Class
Randal Valentine of Lapeer, Michigan.
   Also, Petty Officer 3rd Class Paulo Acedera of San Pedro Laguna,
Republic of the Philippines; Petty Officer 3rd Class John Repik of
Albuquerque, New Mexico; Seaman Daniel Bartolo of Ozone Park, N.Y.;
Seaman James Choss of Hammond Lake, Ind.; and Seaman Edward Gardner
of Scott City, Mo.
   Dansby, Beaver and Repik were in guarded condition, the Navy
said.
   The 437-foot ship was commissioned in 1963. It is armed with
Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Standard anti-aircraft missiles, as
well as torpedoes, depth charges and two 5-inch guns. It can reach
speeds of 30 knots and can fire up to six missiles a minute.
   The Navy, as is its practice, refused to say whether the
Conyngham was carrying nuclear weapons. According to Jane's
Fighting Ships, the Conyngham has the capability of firing nuclear
depth charges and torpedoes.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said he ship was scheduled to be
decommissioned in June 1991. He declined to say if it might be
decommissioned sooner because of the damage.
   In May 1987, the Conyngham helped rescue the USS Stark after it
was hit by missiles from an Iraqi jet in the Persian Gulf. Sixty of
the Conyngham's crew members were decorated for valor for their
actions in fighting the fire aboard the Stark and evacuating the
wounded and dead. The Conyngham later towed the disabled Stark to
port.
   In 1988, an Irish stowaway was discovered aboard the ship as it
made its way back from Ireland. The teen-age girl was found in a
2{-foot-by-15-foot passageway where she had hidden for 10 days.
Four crew members were court-martialed.
   The second Navy accident occurred Tuesday afternoon aboard an
air-cushion vehicle near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Virginia
Beach to the Eastern Shore, said Chief Petty Officer Bob Gimblet of
the Atlantic Fleet.
   Gimblet said he did not know whether the propeller itself or
other debris struck and killed the crew member, who was not
identified pending notification of relatives.
   The flat-shaped boat, which travels on a cushion of air
generated by huge fans or propellers, has a crew of five and is
used for carrying troops and equipment into battle. The vessel was
assigned to Assault Craft Unit 4 based at the Little Creek Naval
Amphibious Base in Norfolk, the Navy said.
   Last fall, a series of accidents around the world in which 14
people died prompted the Navy to order an unprecedented two-day
stand-down to review safety procedures.
   In addition to fires, aircraft crashes and sailors being swept
overboard, a shell fired by the cargo ship El Paso during an
exercise in the Atlantic struck the helicopter carrier Iwo Jima,
killing one person and injuring another. And the pilot of an attack
jet accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb on the cruiser USS Reeves
in the Indian Ocean, slightly injuring five sailors.

   Congressional Democrats are worried that the
public will blame them for any tax increases that emerge from talks
with President Bush over the worsening federal deficit.
   ``I think we should hear straight from the president where he
stands on taxes,'' Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said Tuesday as the
administration outlined the need for up to $100 million in
deficit-fighting actions. ``The president hasn't said what his plan
is, and we shouldn't lead with our chin on this issue.''
   Leaders of both parties in the House and Senate were meeting
again with Bush at the White House today to discuss the widening
fiscal 1991 budget gap, caused partly by a weaker-than-expected
economy and the rising cost of bailing out failed savings and loans.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused Tuesday to rule
out a boost in income taxes. But some Republican senators,
including Bob Packwood of Oregon, said they believed Bush would not
seriously consider that option.

   Excerpts from Oliver North's notebooks linking
him to George Bush apparently never got to Capitol Hill, and
investigations may be warranted, says the former chairman of the
House Iran-Contra committee.
   Portions of the diaries, released Tuesday, renew questions about
whether then-Vice President Bush was more deeply involved in
assisting the Nicaraguan Contra rebels than he has acknowledged.
   One entry suggests North met with Bush a few hours after the
National Security Council aide lied to the House intelligence
committee on Aug. 6, 1986, by testifying that he wasn't supplying
military aid to the Contras.
   After meeting with the committee, North fielded a complaint
about Felix Rodriguez, a former CIA operative working in North's
resupply network. Rodriguez is a longtime friend of Donald Gregg,
then a national security adviser and now ambassador to South Korea.

   The United States and Iran, seeking to remove
a longstanding irritant in their troubled relations, are close to
settling about 2,600 small claims filed by Americans after the 1979
Islamic revolution.
   But the State Department says the progress has been made over
many months and is not linked to the recent release of two American
hostages or the fate of other U.S. citizens still held in Lebanon.
   ``A package settlement of small claims has been under discussion
for some time, and differences have narrowed considerably, but we
have not yet closed this matter,'' spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Tuesday.
   Another U.S. official, who asked not to be identified by name,
said, ``We're close to a settlement now.''

   Federal regulators are cutting prices to speed
the sale of property held by failed savings and loans, but they aim
to avoid fire sales that could spook fragile real estate markets.
   ``It's a fine line that has to be walked,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in putting the administration
behind the stepped-up sale of S&amp;L real estate without endorsing the
details of policy changes adopted by regulators Tuesday.
   The board of the Resolution Trust Corp. agreed to allow its
managers to cut prices by 15 percent if a property goes unsold for
six months, or four months for single-family homes.
   A further reduction of 5 percent will be allowed after an
additional three months. A second policy adopted Tuesday authorizes
auction sales, allowing no more than a 30 percent discount from
appraised value.

   Experimenting with drugs can be a sign of
normal adolescent development, says a new study that calls into
question the ``just say no'' appeal to shun drugs altogether.
   Adolescents who experiment with drugs tend to be better adjusted
than abstainers or abusers, according to the findings by
psychologists Jonathan Shedler and Jack Block of the University of
California, Berkeley.
   The researchers' conclusion that self-control may be more
critical than abstinence conflicts with the ``Just Say No''
anti-drug campaign. But some peers agreed Tuesday that casual drug
use does not always lead to addiction.
   ``This may be hard for some people to take, but the real issue
is knowing when to put the brakes on,'' said Dr. Shirley Feldman,
deputy director of Stanford University's Center for Study of
Family, Children and Youth.

   Ohio voters cast out Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens, his long career
shattered by his conviction on a sex offense, while North
Carolinians boosted a black Democrat's bid to challenge
conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
   ``Never argue with the voters,'' Lukens said finishing a distant
third in Tuesday's GOP primary, which he entered over the
objections of his party's leaders.
   The loss, following his conviction on charges of having sex with
a 16-year-old girl, apparently ended a congressional career that
spanned nearly 25 years.
   On the busiest day of primary elections so far this year, both
Helms and Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia coasted
to easy victories and turned their attention to the general
elections in November.

   Burger King, Wal-Mart, Kinney Shoes, Dunkin'
Donuts are hardly names that stir feelings of fear and loathing in
the masses.
   But for Joseph and Lorrie Liani, the owners of a quaint doughnut
shop down the road from Salem State College, the names are like a
punch in the stomach. It's the feeling that strikes any mom-and-pop
business when a national franchise _ Liani calls them the ``big
boys'' _ rides into town.
   Dunkin' Donuts is the newcomer in their case, and it has hitched
itself up right across the street from the Lianis' little shop.
   ``What you've really got here is two countries fighting a war
and one's fighting with sticks and the other country has guns,''
said Liani, 31.
   The Lianis have poured their adult lives into the Donut Ring, a
shoe-box-size diner with 10 swivel stools, a formica counter and
freshly brewed coffee.
   ``There was always security knowing that we had our own
business,'' said Lorrie Liani, 30. ``There wasn't a threat _ until
now. Somebody's next door, taking our customers away and taking
money out of our pockets and taking food out of our mouths.''
   The Lianis said their business has dropped 10 percent to 15
percent over the first month. ``So it's not as bad as I thought it
might be,'' Liani said.
   Much of the Donut Ring's business comes from the morning traffic
of professors and students to Salem State, and from commuters on
their way to Boston, about 20 miles to the south.
   The Lianis depend on the shop to pay for their home, their two
cars and the hundreds of other debts that come from raising two
children and running a business.
   ``Basically we're just working people like everybody else. It's
not like we're making more money than we know what to do with,''
Liani said. ``We have mortgages. We have car payments. Like
everybody else, we rely on a weekly paycheck to pay for all that.''
   Patrick Kaufmann, an assistant professor of business
administration and marketing at Harvard University who specializes
in franchises, said there's not much more to say than ``That's
business.''
   He said about one-third of all retail dollars in the United
States are spent at franchises each year.
   ``The numbers suggest a homogenization of our society and our
tastes and our mobility,'' he said. ``Standardization is something
that is being sought. Franchising is a huge business.''
   Kaufmann said that while the situation the Lianis face is sad,
it should be remembered that most franchises also are owned by
small-business men and women with their own families.
   ``I don't see much evidence that franchises actively try to
threaten independent businesses. Large franchises look for good
retail space and potential customers. If they find them, they
compete with everyone nearby,'' he said. ``But I'm sure when these
small independents find themselves competing with the franchises it
can be quite daunting.''
   Liani is frustrated by the money franchises have behind them _
money for advertising, facilities and equipment. It's hard for
independent shops to compete, he says.
   ``And, you know, I can't afford to lose money as long as that
guy because he might have three or four more successful stores. If
one's losing money the others make up for it,'' he said.
   Fernando Cafua, a businessman from North Andover, runs the
Dunkin' Donuts across from the Lianis. He also owns three
franchises in Lawrence and is planning more.
   Dunkin' Donuts, which speaks for its franchises, has 1,651 shops
in the United States and 191 in Massachusetts, said Lawrence
Hantman, a vice president and general counsel for the company.
   There are four Dunkin' Donuts in Salem, a city of more than
38,200 people best known for the witch trials of the 1690s. A fifth
is on the way.
   Hantman said for the most part franchise owners decide on their
own locations. ``We have no real estate involvement in it,'' he
said.
   The Lianis aren't giving up. So far they haven't had to worry
about a price war _ both doughnut shops charge about the same
prices. The Donut Ring, for example, has cheaper coffee but more
expensive filled doughnuts.
   And they upgraded their shop. They bought a new refrigerated
display case and expanded and remodeled. They also added specialty
items like pie crusts and croissants.
   ``We're going to try and offer things that they don't have. Like
if you want a chocolate cupcake with real whipped cream like mom
used to make, you'd be able to get it here _ not there,'' Liani
said.
   ``I have 11 years of my life here,'' he said. ``I have a loyal
following. I'm not going to give my business away because someone's
threatening to put me out of business. I'd rather go out fighting
than give up.''

<HEAD>Spiritual _ And Arms Reduction _ Pointers Seen In East Europe
Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   These days are ``a time of special grace,'' say
the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops. They say changes in Eastern Europe
signal not only new freedoms for peoples but enable conversion of
arms budgets to enhancing life and peace.
   That theme was sounding in many religious circles.
   With the fading of the Cold War, the Global Mission Ministry
Unit of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) applauded moves for mutual
troop reductions and hailed the surge ``for freedom, for truth''
and international concord.
   It should replace ``East-West competition with a new partnership
for peace and justice _ in Europe and the world,'' the Catholic
bishops said.
   Curbing the arms race and putting a greater share of resources
into easing social ills and improving the lot of the poor has been
a longtime plea of most mainline churches.
   The changed circumstances accentuated that cause.
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's social-action
commission says the ``new opportunities for peace'' open the way
for redirecting military expenditures to humanitarian purposes.
   Representatives of major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox
Churches in the the National Council of Churches were expected to
speak out on the matter at a meeting May 16-18 in Pittsburgh.
   In one of several recent statements on social policies urging
the shift of arms spending to alleviate human needs at home and
abroad, the 53-bishop board of the U.S. Catholic Conference said:
   ``We thank a providential God for the grace-filled time in which
we live _ for the advent of a new era.'' Declaring that ``this new
moment'' has swept away years of ``stultifying controls'' in
Eastern Europe, the statement added:
   ``We see signs of a deeper movement of the Spirit; a reassertion
of the transcendent, of a deeper understanding of the full meaning
of what it is to be human.''
   Americans have ``an historic opportunity to assist'' the newly
freed peoples in rebuilding their societies,'' the mid-April
statement said, adding:
   ``With a reordering of national priorities, we will be able to
do our part in this region of the world while at the same time
meeting other unmet human and social needs both at home and in the
developing world.''
   The Presbyterians, in a statement proposed for their general
assembly in June, said they rejoiced at the crumbling of ``barriers
between East and West'' and added:
   ``We give thanks for the strong and courageous leadership of the
many Christians who were at the forefront of the movements for
freedom, for truth, for human rights. ...
   ``We strongly support moves in your country and ours for troop
reductions in Europe, those of the United States, the Soviet Union
and those of your individual countries.''
   Bishops of the Catholic conference, in another statement put
before the House and Senate budget committees in late March, noted
that they have long urged less military spending and ``greater
investment in human needs,'' adding:
   ``These concerns take on added urgency given the dramatic
changes'' in the world, ``the pressing needs of new democracies,
and the continuing reality of hunger, homelessness and poverty in
our own land and around the world.''
   The bishops specifically questioned going ahead with the
Strategic Defense Initiative, called ``Star Wars,'' the stealth
bomber and MX missile, saying many experts consider them of
``dubious'' value.
   Military outlays can undermine human welfare, the bishops said,
adding, ``We see the tragic consequences of misplaced priorities in
our shelters and soup kitches, in our hospitals, parishes and
schools.''
   In a letter to members of the congressional committees,
Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angles, chairman of an international
policy committee, and Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, head
of a domestic policy committee, said:
   ``We can support democracy abroad and fight hunger and
homelessness at home. We can also address the problems of
inadequate health care and education in our own land.''
   But that demands cutting unnecessary spending, including reduced
military expenditures ``in light of the diminishing threat'' and
``transition to an economy less dependent on military spending,''
the bishops said.
   Abroad, they said, ``a major shift from military assistance to
economic aid ... is essential if we are to meet our international
moral obligations.''
   The federal budget was termed ``not just a fiscal blueprint, but
also a moral document'' reflecting the conscience of America about
its responsibilities.

<HEAD>Prime Time Shows Stretching Network Standards</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note that contents may be objectionable to some.</NOTE>

   It was 1987, and there was the soft-spoken
and fatherly Dr. Donald Westphall of ``St. Elsewhere'' baring his
bottom in a showdown with the fictional hospital's new owner.
   But that really was actor Ed Flander's bottom and it really was
naked. And it really was broadcast to millions of television sets
during prime time.
   This season, ``L.A. Law'' broke ground by breaking wind. A young
man suffering from Tourette's syndrome uttered racial slurs on the
witness stand. The insufferable Douglas Brackman was the recipient
of a sexual favor delivered by a female bailiff crouched under his
desk.
   During a recent impromptu lovemaking session on
``thirtysomething,'' Michael promised an undiaphragmed Hope that he
would practice coitus interruptus. In the same series, two gay men
were shown in bed together.
   All of this on network television? In prime time?
   You bet. And there's more.
   It used to be that you couldn't say the ``p'' word on
television. As in pregnant, as in when Lucy was carrying little
Ricky and everyone referred to her as being ``in the family way.''
   But now, as networks struggle to compete against independent
stations, cable networks and home video rentals, shows on the Big
Three in the 10 p.m. time slot break taboos with each broadcast.
Fox Broadcasting pushes the envelope earlier on Sundays with the
raunchy sitcoms ``The Simpsons'' and ``Married ... With Children.''
   So if you're sitting on the couch, flipping through the dial,
you will see cursing, sex, societal no-nos, plenty of double
entendres and even some nudity.
   But although the networks have lightened up and audiences have
become more sophisticated, there still are taboos.
   Yet, the producers of two of television's more adventurous shows
say it is an arbitrary and weird bargaining system that decides
what makes it onto television and what doesn't.
   ``It's like arms negotiations,'' said William Finkelstein,
supervising producer of NBC's ``L.A. Law.''
   Explains executive producer David Kelley, ``The network will say
things like, `We'll let you have two bastards if you take out that
son of a bitch.'''
   When Finkelstein and Kelley wanted to have a bare bottom on
their show, NBC said no, even though it let ``St. Elsewhere'' show
one three years ago.
   The reason? ``Context,'' said Kelley. Evidently NBC considered
the demure Westphall's ``mooning'' more compelling than ``L.A.
Law'' wanting to film a naked derriere as part of an episode that
opened at a nudist colony.
   But when Brackman enlists the help of a sex surrogate,
experiences pronounced flatulence during their interlude and passes
out, the network said nothing.
   The producers said NBC gives them great license when it comes to
story lines. But when it comes to enforcing programming standards,
Finkelstein said it is a sliding scale that has nothing to do with
morals.
   ``I think it's all money,'' Finkelstein said. ``I don't think
morality enters into it at all. If they thought the market would do
well, they'd put nudity on TV.''
   Don't viewers protest? Don't they write letters?
   According to Kelley, the biggest viewer outrage was over taking
the Lord's name in vain.
   ``We used goddamn twice last year. The network said OK. The
public backlash was so severe we had to dub it for the reruns,''
Kelley said.
   Over at ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' the network threatened to not
air the episode in which Michael promises Hope during sex that he
will, er, stop early.
   ``We went around and around and around on this thing,'' said
Scott Winant, the show's supervising producer. ``When they saw the
cut and the way in which we portrayed it, they gave in. They let us
keep the scene.''
   Like Finkelstein and Kelley, Winant said network standards are
sometimes impossible to predict.
   ``Who knows?'' Winant said. ``There's nothing in writing. We are
just amazed at where they draw the line.
   ``It's ridiculous to some extent,'' he said. ``In the case of
the two men in bed, we just pushed it a little too far with them.
They said, `Do you have to say bitch twice in one episode?' And we
said `OK, you've given us two guys in bed so we'll take out one
bitch.'
   ``You couldn't say pregnant years ago, so I guess we've overcome
that,'' Winant said. ``The networks want to give at least the
appearance of being more open-minded.''
   Elsewhere in Television ...
   MORE ON THE DICEMAN: Speaking of curse words, comedian Marty
Brill issued this statement about ``Saturday Night Live'' performer
Nora Dunn refusing to participate in this weekend's show because
foul-mouthed comic Andrew Dice Clay is the host:
   ``Andrew Dice Clay showed a great deal of class and restraint in
the much-publicized `Saturday Night Live' matter by not pointing
out that Nora and Dunn are both four-letter words!''
   So are Dice and Clay.

   The task of managing money in a personal
retirement plan brings out the cautious streak in many American
savers.
   With their long-term future resting heavily on individual
retirement accounts, employer-sponsored 401(k) plans and similar
tax-favored arrangements, they tend to see these nest eggs as too
important to be exposed to the risks of volatile markets.
   Hence there's a widespread appetite for interest-bearing
investments, especially those covered by some sort of guarantee,
rather than alternatives that are subject to the ups and downs of
the securities markets.
   For example, even after the runaway bull market in stocks of the
1980s, more than half of all Americans' individual retirement
account assets was on deposit at banks, savings institutions and
credit unions.
   About 22 percent of the total IRA assets of $393 billion as of
the end of 1988 was entrusted to mutual funds, according to
estimates by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
   What's more, within the mutual funds' share of the IRA business,
54 percent of the money was invested in income and money market
funds, leaving 46 percent entrusted to managers of stock funds.
   Most experts on the subject agree that these statistics show a
justified sense of prudence.
   Retirement accounts are designed to foster long-term saving, not
speculative financing of high-risk ventures. Some of the tax rules
covering them reinforce that basic principle.
   Ordinarily, a capital loss on something such as a stock-market
investment can be written off against your ordinary income, up to a
limit of $3,000 per year, on your tax return. No such consolation
is available, however, within retirement accounts that provide for
deferral of any income taxation until withdrawals begin.
   Yet with all this, many financial advisers say it is easy to get
too cautious in your retirement saving choices, overemphasizing
safety of your dollar investment while overlooking the hazards of
inflation.
   The longer the time you have before retirement, they say, the
stronger the historical case for stock market-related investments.
   ``Over a long time horizon, an equity portfolio should perform
at least as well as, and most likely better than, a fixed-income
portfolio,'' says the accounting firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche in a
current bulletin on the subject.
   For all 20-year periods starting in any month dating back to
1926, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index posted a
better return than was available from Treasury bills, the firm says.
   Stock returns vary drastically. They reached 19.3 percent a year
in the 1950s, fell to 5.9 percent by the 1970s, and rebounded to
17.5 percent in the 1980s, according to the investment management
firm of T. Rowe Price Associates.
   However, says Deloitte &amp; Touche, people who make regular
contributions to retirement savings programs actually can turn
these ups and downs to their benefit through the phenomenon known
as dollar cost averaging.
   When similar dollar amounts are invested at intervals in, say, a
stock mutual fund, the money buys more shares at lower prices,
helping to reduce the average price paid per share.
   ``The periodic investing that occurs in retirement accounts _
which is, in effect, dollar cost averaging _ has a much more
positive effect on volatile investments than on non-volatile
investments,'' Deloitte &amp; Touche notes.
   The risk in this, of course, is that stocks in the future might
not live up to the standards of the past. In an investment that
drops steadily over time and never rebounds, dollar-cost averaging
isn't much help.
   But over the past couple of generations, long-term investors
have been amply rewarded for taking that chance.

<HEAD>The Bright Side of Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a bright side to the malicious looking
inflation rate of the first quarter, and probably to the higher
jobless rate too.
   Each of these reports, issued separately, caused a flurry of
worry.
   If the high inflation rate were sustained, it was feared, the
Federal Reserve would be forced to raise interest rates, which
already are high enough to crimp the style of buyers and sellers of
homes and cars.
   If the jobless rate _ in April it had its first pronounced rise
in more than a year _ were to continue rising, then it would
indicate that the economy was losing even more of its already
feeble strength.
   When you look for trouble in the economic numbers you can always
find it. A lot depends upon the psychological mood into which the
statistical confetti is tossed, and judging by the reaction, that
mood already was turning dour.
   The shocking jump of the consumer price index in the first three
months helped to blacken the mood. Rising at an annualized rate of
more than 8 percent, the worst showing since the first quarter of
1981, the CPI suggested serious trouble.
   The worries were deepened by the breadth of the numbers:
Practically all major categories showed increases, some of
sufficient size to remind worriers about the double digit days of
the 1970s.
   Food prices were up 11 percent, energy up 19 percent, apparel 11
percent and lodging costs 22 percent. Some of those items are so
necessary to personal well being that buyer resistance could not be
applied to bring prices down.
   The good news:
   Spring has come. The amazing output of the nation's agriculture
industry is now providing a cornucopia for markets. Warmer weather
already has forced reductions in fuel costs. Lodging? Vacancy rates
are high everywhere.
   These factors, logic suggests, would make double digit inflation
a very unlikely event during the summer months. But what about
clothing costs? A very typical situation that is bound to correct
itself, say those who know.
   In late winter-early spring, and again in the fall, new
merchandise is put on the market, generally at higher prices. In
the months that follow, however, those prices come down, because
merchants must clear the racks for newer items.
   Here's how analysts at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. explain the
phenomenon:
   ``March and April have seen 30 percent or higher price increases
for many years. Normally, this retail pricing pattern washes out in
year-over-year comparisons, as one year's high March prices are
compared to the previous year's high March prices, and conversely,
low-priced months are compared.''
   In short, there was little that couldn't be explained about the
first-quarter runup in prices. The news wasn't really sufficient to
bring out all those bleak views of the future. The facts weren't
there, but the mood was.
   The rise in the jobless rate for April might be something of the
same sort, a signal not to be taken too seriously. It rose, after
all, by just two-tenths of 1 percent, to 5.3 percent of the labor
force from 5.1 percent in March.
   Is that a significant rise?
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, seemed not to
think so. She told Congress that ``thus far we can discern no
meaningful changes in the measures that might signal a
deteriorating unemployment situation.''
   Jobless figures, moreover, are subject to statistical revision,
and it would be no surprise to see the number lowered as additional
data are analyzed.
   The smallest downward revision would be just one-tenth of 1
percent, but you might find it worthwhile to consider that such a
reduction would mean cutting in half the worrisome ``jump'' in the
jobless rate for April.

   Clinging to life until his book came out, AIDS
victim Terry Boyd murmured when it was placed in his hands, ``God
and I did this.'' He died a few hours later.
   Boyd, 39, a United Methodist and member of the denomination's

``Living With AIDS: One Christian's Struggle.''
   ``Having AIDS is just plain awful,'' he wrote. ``But where the

<HEAD>Advertising Takes Different Angle To Drum Up Religion</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Always before, Madison Avenue has aimed its
religion advertising pitch at the non-user, urging outsiders to
attend worship. That rarely worked. So the approach has been
changed.
   It's now aimed at the users themselves, the loyal church-goers,
with some large expectations and a risky dash of humor thrown in to
add some sparkle.
   ``Invite a Friend,'' goes the keynote phrase, and in some
cartoon ads and television spots, a hardy worshipper virtually
drags a reluctant non-participant into involvement.
   ``There's a great deal of gloom and doom in most public service
advertising,'' said Ruth Wooden, president of the Advertising
Council, which cooperates in the venture with an interfaith
coalition, Religion in American Life.
   ``It's much more effective psychology to say, `let's laugh
together at ourselves','' she added. ``It diffuses hesitations.''
   However, the basic switch is in focusing the appeal on active
members of churches and synagogues rather than on non-members as in
the past, seeking to enlist millions of present worshippers into
inducing others to come along.
   That's the ``big ticket'' approach in advertising parlance, said
Laurel Cutler, vice chairman and director of marketing planning for
the FCB, Leber Katz Partners agency which developed the current
campaign.
   ``Advertising, no matter how brilliant, can't do it alone on a
long considered decision, but is only one step. So we turn to
mobilizing those already doing it to foster it through friends,''
she said.
   That also has been found through studies to be the
overwhelmingly principal draw that gets newcomers into religious
activity.
   The Rev. Nicholas B. van Dyck, president of RIAL, including
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish bodies,
said 86 percent of Americans involved in congregations were invited
by a friend or relative.
   ``Much recent data suggests that to encourage human behavior
needs person-to-person influence,'' he said. ``We're shifting the
focus from those who aren't attending worship to members who are.''
   He said only 1{ percent of newcomers are drawn by direct
advertising appeals to them. ``This is a very different campaign,
with extensive grass-roots involvement.''
   Introductory materials, including an ``Action Guide'' on
enlisting and training volunteers and forming task forces, are
being distributed to participating groups totalling more than 56
million members.
   Van Dyck, a Presbyterian, told a news conference that this
year's campaign launches a 10-year project, with fresh ads
developed each year or so, to increase church membership about 40
percent to top 200 million in the decade.
   Currently, U.S. religious membership totals 154 million, 62
percent of the population. Polls find that 42 percent of the
population attends worship weekly.
   Public service ads were distributed to newspapers and magazines
across the country in April. Spots on television and radio, transit
posters and outdoor billboard ads appear this fall.
   Estimates put the combined value of the advertising used at $20
million.
   The current campaign also is emphasizing the public service
contributions of religious congregations.
   Surveys find members are three times more likely than
unaffiliated people to be involved in social services, such as
feeding the hungry, housing the homeless and elderly, caring for
the sick, providing child care.
   Congregations provide money, outside their own expenses, for
such human services twice that given by all corporations and
foundations combined, studies have found.
   Religion ``is one of the key resources in meeting human need,''
Ms. Wooden said. ``To the extent we increase participation, it
contributes proportionately more to improving society.''
   She said results of the new campaign will be measureable over a
period of time, since it asks specific action rather than being
aimed at modifying attitudes of non-participants as in the past.
   The 40-year-old RIAL was started in 1949 as a collaboration
between religious bodies and the advertising industry, including
numerous corporate advertisers.
   Ms. Cutler, whose firm contibuted about $500,000 worth of work
on this year's campaign, said participating religious leaders
solidly backed the use of humor in some of the ads.
   ``It was a gutsy,, strong-mided decision,'' she said, noting
that religious appeals usually are solemn. She said humor can be a
``dangerous device,'' but it also can ``help humanize'' an appeal
and give it more natural empathy.
   Noting the studies showing that ``people who participate in the
life of a church or synagogue truly make a difference'' in society,
she added:
   ``This country would clearly be better able to meet today's
challenges if more of us were part of the mix of friendships,
aspirations and service to others that comes with being a part of a
church or synagogue.''

<HEAD>Ryan White's Mother Continuing Son's AIDS Education Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIE FAIRBANK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CICERO, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jeanne White knew her son probably would
lose his battle against AIDS at a young age. Now, a month after
Ryan's death, she has taken up his AIDS education mission to keep
his memory and ideals alive.
   Ryan had fought for the right to attend public school near
Kokomo, battled against AIDS discrimination and struggled to
promote AIDS education.
   He won each battle but his last. He died April 8 at age 18 of an
AIDS-related respiratory infection.
   Mrs. White's home is filled with photographs of Ryan with the
celebrities he called friends. His car magazines and comic books
are scattered through the house, his dogs romp in the yard, and the
red Ford Mustang his buddy, singer Michael Jackson, gave him is in
the garage.
   His suitcase, packed with new clothes for a trip to Florida,
remains opened across his bed.
   ``He's all around me,'' said Mrs. White, 42.
   But some things are different. This Mother's Day the house is
colder.
   Ryan, who was diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in December 1984 at age 13, was often cold. A special
heater he used to warm his hands is still in front of the
television and a pair of slippers sit empty nearby.
   ``Ryan was always with his heater because Ryan was always
cold,'' Mrs. White said. Now, the spring breeze sweeps through open
windows and doors.
   Before Ryan entered Riley Hospital for Children for the final
time, Mrs. White had considered moving him and her 16-year-old
daughter, Andrea, to California's more moderate climate.
   Those plans are no longer being considered. Instead, Mrs. White
plans to continue Ryan's work in AIDS education from their home
about 20 miles north of Indianapolis.
   Already, she has testified on Capitol Hill for the passage of a
bill that would provide $600 million to help fight AIDS. The Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee approved the legislation last
month and dedicated the bill to Ryan.
   A member of the American Federation for AIDS Research, Mrs.
White traveled to New York City to speak about AIDS on World Kid's
Day, May 6.
   The torch has been passed.
   ``I'm just going to try and work in the back of things. If
progress can be made through Ryan's name, I'm going to work through
it. I want to work any way I can,'' she said.
   Ryan contracted AIDS from a blood by-product used to treat his
hemophilia. His mother knew he would have health problems when he
was only a few days old, was circumcised and bled profusely. At 5,
he began twice-weekly injections to help clot his blood.
   Mrs. White said she thought the blood by-product was a miracle
drug because at that time hemophiliacs lived only to age 12 or 13.
   ``Little did we know that the same thing we thought would save
them would destroy them,'' she said. ``Nobody told us where they
get the blood. They pay people to donate it. Chances are that Ryan
got it from an IV drug user, but it could have been from anybody.
That's why we never pointed any fingers.''
   The Whites were unable to sue the company that produced the
blood product because of a state law that bars lawsuits for
illnesses stemming from blood or blood derivatives.
   Mrs. White said she won't fight the law. ``I'm through with
attorneys,'' she said.
   The family did, however, win a legal battle to keep Ryan in
public school. He was barred from Western Middle School nea Kokomo
in 1985 because school officials feared the health risk for other
children was too great.
   The courts finally ruled that Ryan could attend school. His
courage and determination captured the hearts of people worldwide,
and suddenly he was in demand as a spokesman.
   Now that AIDS is better understood, Mrs. White said, some
Kokomo-area residents have told her they regret their part in
trying to keep her son out of school.
   David Rosselot, attorney for the group of parents who sued to
keep Ryan out of school, attended Ryan's funeral. ``He said if he
had to do it again he would not have taken the case,'' Mrs. White
said.
   After winning the legal battle, the Whites moved about 20 miles
away to Cicero, where they were welcomed by the school district and
the community.
   Ryan lived the life of a normal teen-ager, hanging out with
friends, dating. His prom date for this year, Heather McNew,
decided not to go to the dance after Ryan died.
   Mrs. White is trying to move forward. Her friends and family
keep expecting her to wear out with all the activity _ especially
answering the thousands of cards and letters she has received since
Ryan's death. But she believes she can stay strong.
   She is planning a Memorial Day ceremony to mark her son's
achievements. At that time, a headstone will be placed on the grave
at the Cicero Cemetery.
   Ryan's grave is covered with flowers, notes and wax from a
burning candle Mrs. White tends twice a day. There is also a poster
made by soldiers from Fort Benjamin Harrison. It is special to her
because of Ryan's fondness for GI Joe dolls, she said.
   Actor Matt Frewer, who played the computer-generated TV
character Max Headroom, bought the headstone, which was planned at
first to be 5 feet tall, Ryan's height. Now it will stand 6-foot-8
because Ryan always wished he was taller, his mother said.
   The inscription on the black-and-white headstone will be written
by Ryan's friends, Jackson and Elton John.
   ``I just want everything to be as positive as he was,'' Jeanne
said. ``In the evening I pray and I tell him stupid stuff that
happens. I really think he would not come back from where he is
at,'' Mrs. White said. ``As much as we loved each other ... he's
happy.
   ``The only thing he might come back for is a Saleen (a
high-performance version of the Mustang automobile),'' she said
with a laugh, wiping away tears.

   Anyone who's tried to forage for vinyl in a
music store knows the frustrating truth. Records are dying.
   But the speed with which they are disappearing has led some
music fans _ not just vinyl romantics _ to wonder whether it's a
natural death or if records are being killed off prematurely.
   The bad news has been piling up this year:
   _ Warner-Elektra-Atlantic announces it will cut out more than 40
percent of its vinyl catalog. That means 1,205 album titles owned
by the conglomerate will no longer be available on records.
   _ The Tower Records chain says it won't sell 7-inch singles
anymore _ that's after several major labels, including CBS and A&amp;M,
say they won't accept returns on unsold records.
   _ Two major labels, PolyGram and Chrysalis, announce that, with
a few rare exceptions, all their new releases will be only on
cassette tape and compact disc.
   ``It's really kicked in with a vengeance for the last six
months,'' said Robert Cohen, manager of the Finyl Vinyl record
store in New York City. ``Things that people took for granted _
things that they used to see in the record bins for the last 20
years _ are now gone.''
   The day will come, sooner than most people expect, when it will
be rare to find a new album released on vinyl, predicted Michael
Stotter, Chrysalis' vice president for marketing.
   ``By Christmas 1990, when the next burst of CD hardware buying
takes place, vinyl will be virtually nonexistent,'' he said.
   The facts show record buyers are part of a minority group
growing smaller every day. Manufacturers shipped out 34 million
records in 1989, according to the Recording Industry Association of
America. That's less than half what they shipped the year before,
and a fraction of the 341 million during the pre-CD era year of
1978.
   By contrast, manufacturers shipped out 207 million CDs and 446
million cassettes during 1989.
   The reasons are simple. ``Boom boxes'' and small, portable
cassette players are the favorites of kids these days, and
wealthier music lovers have been seduced by the sound of CDs.
   ``We've seen this happen in the industry before,'' said Trish
Heimers, RIAA spokeswoman. ``From the 78s to the compact disc, the
industry has always been changing. As the technology changed,
people moved on.''
   The music business has powerful reasons for helping people move
on as fast as possible. It doesn't pay to keep pressing plants
humming when they're turning out a trickle of records.
   Merchants, in turn, would like to ditch records so they'll have
more room to store cassettes and the more expensive compact discs.
Only 2 percent of sales in the 82-store Record World chain are in
records, so vinyl is being phased out, said Mitch Imber, purchasing
director.
   ``Something had to give,'' he said.
   That's all ammunition for conspiracy theorists who think records
are being killed off too fast.
   ``The industry itself has tried to make records obsolete,
instead of the marketplace making them obsolete,'' said Johnny
Konrad, who owns Johnny's record store in Darien, Conn. ``It's the
tail wagging the dog. The industry wants to make it harder to get
records, to establish the CDs.''
   John Riopelle, a student at the Junior College of Albany, said
he frequently feels like an antiques collector when searching for
records. Riopelle can't afford a CD player, and said he prefers the
look of an album, with its cover art and liner notes, to a cassette.
   It's disconcerting, he said, when he can find his favorite
alternative rock albums only in the import bin _ priced higher than
CDs. ``I would like to be able to continue to buy them and not have
the latest technology shoved down my throat.''
   Merchants still interested in stocking records say return
policies and reordering difficulties are putting pressure on them
to relent.
   Many record companies charge a penalty for return of an unsold
record. For instance, Konrad said, he'll get only $4.50 to return a
record for which he paid $6, even if it's defective. But there's no
penalty for cassette and CD returns.
   The decisions of so many record companies not to accept returns
on 7-inch singles is what drove Tower Records out of the business
of 45s. Store managers had to worry about ordering too few records
and selling out, or ordering too many and being left with worthless
extras.
   Konrad said he's continually frustrated in ordering new copies
of records. He's ordered copies of Keith Richards' ``Talk Is
Cheap'' album every week since September and, in late March, still
hadn't gotten any. He's had only one shipment of the B-52s ``Cosmic
Thing'' album on vinyl _ and it's a Top 10 hit.
   Rocky Roy, owner of the Music Shack in Albany, tries to keep new
records in stock because many of his music-hungry customers aren't
willing to risk $15 for a CD of an artist they barely know.
   A recent experience by Chrysalis shows the volatility of this
changeover. The second album by Irish singer Sinead O'Connor,
released in late March, was initially one of the albums the record
company planned to release only on CD and cassette.
   O'Connor, coming from a country where vinyl still reigns, cried
foul. Chrysalis relented and printed records. And, Stotter said,
the company received almost 40,000 orders for LPs before the album
was even released _ far more than it expected.
   Stotter admitted he underestimated the appeal of vinyl for
O'Connor's new album which has topped the charts since its release.
But it doesn't change his opinion that the days of vinyl are
numbered, and he says the industry is innocent of forcing the trend.
   ``I don't think the record companies are trying to kill it off
at all,'' he said. ``It's the people who frequent records stores
who are showing less and less interest in records.''
   As a collector with thousands of records herself, Heimer
sympathizes with record fanatics. But ``the one or two or 12 or 100
LP buyers who are shouting that they're killing it off prematurely
just aren't buying millions of LPs to make it worthwhile for the
companies,'' she said.
   The fast disappearance of LPs has given rise to a new type of
specialty store trying to fill the vacuum created by big chains
abandoning LPs. One such store, Last Chance Records in Chicago,
shuns CDs.
   Finyl Vinyl had no irony in mind when it took its name five
years ago, Cohen said. Now it specifically caters to a
vinyl-starved public, particularly with hard-to-find used records
from the 1960s.
   ``You can go into any chain store today, in any mall, looking
for a copy of any of the famous Bob Dylan albums from the 1960s and
you won't find it anymore on album,'' he said.
   ``That's amazing to me. That's scandalous.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hearing Arguments Over Flag-Burning Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court this weeks takes up
Congress' attempt to protect the American flag from desecration.
While the issue before the justices is the law's constitutionality,
politics won't be far below the surface.
   The high court will hear arguments Monday and is expected to
rule by the time its current term ends, probably in late June or
early July. If the law is struck down, a proposed constitutional
amendment to protect the flag almost certainly would become a
leading issue in congressional and state legislative races this
fall.
   The one-hour argument session is extraordinary. On only three
occasions in recent times has the court heard arguments on a case
so late in a session.
   The law, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, makes it a crime,
punishable by up to a year in prison, for anyone who burns,
mutilates, defaces or tramples on the flag or ``maintains (it) on
the floor or ground.''
   The court will examine its past rulings on the First Amendment
safeguards of free speech and expression.
   While the Bush administration defends the law, it's no secret
President Bush and leading Republicans would prefer a
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning _ something that would
be unnecessary if the justices uphold the law.
   The prime sponsors of the law are Democrats, who learned a
bitter lesson from the 1988 presidential campaign in which Bush
exploited patriotic values in defeating Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, possibly a future Democratic
presidential contender, put the matter in perspective in a brief
submitted to the high court.
   If the law is struck down, the brief said, ``there will be a
serious and profound impact on New York and other states because
such a ruling would almost certainly trigger a divisive battle in
Congress and in the states over whether a constitutional amendment
to permit a ban on flag burning should be passed.''
   The speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has
promised a House vote on a constitutional amendment within 30 days
if the court invalidates the law.
   Such an amendment, proclaiming that a ban on flag burning does
not violate free speech, would require approval by two-thirds of
the members of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38
state legislatures.
   The First Amendment has not been modified since it took force
199 years ago.
   When lawyers for the administration and demonstrators who have
burned flags address the court Monday, they may target Justice
Harry A. Blackmun more than the other eight jurists.
   Blackmun voted with the majority in June when the justices, by a
5-4 margin, struck down a Texas law barring desecration or
destruction of the flag. The court said that burning the flag as a
form of political protest is protected by the Constitution's
free-speech guarantees.
   But Blackmun, in a 1974 ruling, indicated he might go along with
some laws to protect the flag's ``physical integrity.''
   In that case, Blackmun dissented as the court threw out the
conviction of a Massachusetts man who wore a small flag on the seat
of his pants.
   The Flag Protection Act was a reaction to the court's June
ruling and the political firestorm that followed.
   House Democratic leaders say the law differs from the Texas
statute because the federal act does not single out flag burning as
a means of expression.
   The Texas law specifically banned flag burning that seriously
offends others.
   The federal law forbids defiling or destruction of the flag for
any purpose _ except to destroy a soiled or tattered flag.
   The Justice Department, in a written brief to the court, said,
``It is the physical assault and accompanying violation of the
flag's physical integrity _ not robust and uninhibited debate _
that occasion the injury that our society should not be called upon
to bear.''
   Moreover, the department said, the court owes Congress special
deference in this case because an equal branch of government has
determined flag burning can be outlawed without violating freedom
of speech.
   Lawyers for the demonstrators said their clients ``consider flag
burning an essential element of their political expression because,
for them, the flag represents not glory but oppression.''
   They also said flag desecration has been an American tradition.
``The United States flag was born of a desecration,'' the lawyers
said. ``George Washington ... in 1776 ... defaced a British flag by
ordering sewn upon it 13 red and white stripes.''

<HEAD>One Band's Journey From Lava Rock to Black Rock</HEAD>

   Four years ago, a band called Poi Dog Pondering
gathered once a week under swaying palm trees in front of a
Woolworth's store in Waikiki, playing for small change from bemused
tourists.
   Today, the group has a seven-album contract with Columbia
Records after an agonizing, eight-month major label bidding war
that was won primarily when Columbia's president intervened to woo
the band.
   Besides the record deal, Poi Dog has acquired other
accoutrements of success: a manager, a lawyer, videos on Music
Television and a European tour. Their debut album with Columbia,
``Wishing Like a Mountain, Thinking Like the Sea,'' was released
last month.
   The journey from lava rock to Black Rock, CBS's monolithic black
marble headquarters in Manhattan, began in 1986 when Poi Dog's
leader, Frank Orrall, proposed that anyone who wanted to tour the
mainland show up at Honolulu International Airport.
   Nine took the leap and ended up cramming all their instruments
and belongings into two cars for an extended, open-ended,
cross-country trip, not knowing where they would go or how they
would support themselves. Two of the original group remain in the
band today.
   Poi Dog, Hawaiian slang for a mix-breed dog, is a fitting
moniker for the group that combines the usual guitar, bass and
drums with the not-so-usual Latvian lap harp, an accordian, the
flugelhorn, tin whistle, wood block and somebody's used frying pan.
   For five months, the musical caravan rambled across the
continent. On the road and off Orrall wrote songs that combined
earthy imagery with a focus on love and death, endured life's pain
and reveled in its joy. Most songs have upbeat flourishes that have
led some critics to grumble that the tunes are just too happy.
   During their meanderings, Orrall nurtured a contract deal with
Texas Hotel Records, based in Santa Monica, Calif. He met the
label's owners, Michael Meister and Susan Farrell, in 1984 when
they had a record store, Texas Records, that catered to alternative
bands and small labels. Bands such as R.E.M., 10,000 Maniacs and
Concrete Blonde stopped by the store to play for free.
   Meister and Farrell later closed the shop to join forces with
Steve Tesluk to create a label full of ripe acts, including former
Black Flag leader Henry Rollins and his band, Downy Mildew, and new
acts such as Baby Flamehead and New Chestnut.
   Orrall liked the people at Texas Hotel because they were ``such
defenders of the young and the raw.'' Poi Dog made two EP records
with Texas Hotel under a five-album contract. But the terms were
not ironclad.
   Poi Dog began to get gigs _ and huge exposure _ at major
recording industry conventions. And ``the suits,'' as those from
independent labels like to derisively call major label record
executives, were hungry for the alternative sound _ one that
doesn't generally rely on synthesizers or heavy technology in the
recording studio.
   Alternative songs also shy away from traditional pop and rock
structures and often combine influences from other cultures and
ethnic groups. Recording is cheaper, done in fewer takes and rarely
is heavily remixed, sometimes giving it more of a garage band feel.
   And alternative music is rooted in idealism: music for music's
sake and not for commerical prosperity.
   Poi Dog's big break came in 1988, when Texas Hotel arranged
several gigs at the New Music Seminar in New York City, a hotbed of
record execs looking for the next New Big Thing.
   The group traveled by van once again to New York, a trip that
was chronicled by avant-garde filmmaker and animator Laura
Margulies, who is currently working on an animation for a future
music video.
   ``That's when people became interested,'' Orrall said. Record
executives, called A&amp;R's for artist and repertoire, started
appearing at Poi Dog concerts.
   One was Michael Hill, who was scouting sounds for Warner Bros.
``I thought they were fun,'' Hill said, ``but I didn't get a great
impression of them one way or another.''
   A few months later, Hill saw them in a better venue and became
an instant fan. ``I was just knocked out by it.''
   Hill made overtures, and told Orrall he'd like to talk more. He
also began to follow the group around the country, like a school
boy with a bad case of puppy love.
   ``By the time they reached Austin for the South-by-Southwest
music conference, it was so out of control. Everyone in the
business came to the show. ... They were great,'' Hill said.
   One A&amp;R executive who took notice was Columbia's Michael
Gallelli. ``I heard their music on tape before I saw them,'' he
said, ``and it was really one of those things where I was a fan
first.''
   He liked Poi Dog's diverse influences. ``They were combining
lots of different styles, like African to Caribbean to Celtic
infuences. I thought that was really great that they were able to
bring it all together. And then there was a story-telling aspect
that I really liked.''
   In the meantime, thoughts of playing an East Coast gig were
making Orrall nervous because he knew that after the last song was
performed, the stage would be overtaken by a tribe of record execs.
   By that time, even though Orrall wasn't rushing to sign with
anyone, it was boiling down to a deal with either Warner Bros. or
A&amp;M.
   Warners, with its solid reputation as a haven for independent,
alternative music, interested Orrall. But the label wasn't sure if
it could sign Poi Dog, he said, because they had a lot going on
with other bands. A&amp;M, which had been independently owned and was
in the process of being bought out, was tempting. But the prospect
of new ownership made the band nervous.
   ``We were on Texas Hotel. We had all the creative freedom that
we wanted _ we could do anything,'' he said. ``It was a perfect
situation. I was in no hurry to give any of that away for a bigger
venue.''
   Enter Don Ienner, Columbia Records' president and chief suitor.

   Ienner at 36 became the label's youngest president when he took
over last April. He was at his new job for less than 48 hours when
he heard the Poi Dog tape and decided to make the band his cause
celebre.
   ``I must have had 40 tapes that weekend,'' Ienner said. ``All of
the sudden this thing came on and I was astounded by it.''
   He especially liked the song ``Living With the Dreaming Body,''
which begins with a lilting tin whistle, and listened to it about
100 times. He later mastered the tin whistle so he could play the
intro himself.
   After checking around, he found Columbia was ``either the 11th
or 12th company interested in the band. That really got my juices
going.
   ``Basically we told them we wanted them, and they said they
don't want to be with Columbia,'' Ienner said. ``(The band
thought), `it's too corporate, it's too monolithic, it's too
bureaucratic.'''
   But when Ienner met Poi Dog's manager, Mike Stewart, they
n of America.
   In 1975, an infamously slow time for the recording industry,
earnings totaled $2.37 billion, the RIAA said. In 1978, punk and
new wave signaled a revival and the figure jumped to $4.13 billion.
In 1988, $6.25 billion was earned.
   ``We needed to change direction,'' Ienner said. ``There was
nothing, just retreading the superstars, just one after another
after another.''
   Poi Dog would be the Columbia's ``signature band,'' Ienner said,
to show ``our musical sensitivity.''
   It would also help establish a division within Columbia that
would cater to a huge audience carved out in large part by college
radio stations looking for an alternative to Top 40 music.
   Those involved refuse to discuss the deal's financial side. But
many in the industry say the band was signed for more than $200,000
for the first album. A new pop band can fetch anywhere from $75,000
to $350,000 for its first record contract, industry officals say.
   The sum, however, doesn't just pile into the musician's pockets.
Much of it is reinvested to pay for the recording costs for the
first album. The ballpark figures for recording an album go from
about $200,000 to $400,000, said Harold Vogel, an entertainment
industry analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Another hunk goes to practical expenses such as paying off band
members' debts. And still another chunk is invested in upgrading
the band's equipment and buying new instruments.
   The rest goes to lifestyle expenses to maintain the band while
they are recording and keep them going until they get to record
number two, which brings another windfall.
   Although Orrall is tight-lipped about how much Poi Dog got, he
does give a general breakdown for how it was used:
   ``What we essentially are doing with our advance is just putting
it in an account and paying everyone in the band $1,000 a month so
... everyone can quit their jobs, pay their rent, get their guitar
strings and buy their beer,'' he said.
   To celebrate the contract, Poi Dog Pondering played a surprise
set at Columbia's offices. They set up in an elevator and when the
doors opened, they began to play.
   People slowly drifted from their offices into the halls. ``The
sound traveled down the elevator banks and people were coming up
the stairwells from all the floors,'' said Mary Ellen Cataneo, a
Columbia publicist.
   ``Literally, people had tears in their eyes,'' Ienner said.
``People were all standing there with tears in their eyes.''
   It was the first time in 20 years a musician had played live at
Columbia's offices. The guy who did it was also a new artist _ a
young piano player by the name of Billy Joel.

   ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
   
   By turning normal values of society topsy-turvy, Pedro Almodovar
has established himself as Spain's most provocative filmmaker.
``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' brought him
international acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for best
foreign language picture of 1988.
   Almodovar's new film, descriptively titled ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me
Down!'' attracted a minor storm of controversy before its release
in this country. The Ratings Board of the Motion Picture
Association of America recoiled at a graphic sex scene and dealt
the film an X rating. An appeal failed to reverse the decision. Now
Miramax Films is releasing the film without a rating, but with a
caution about its adult material.
   The rating controversy may attract those in search of sensation.
They are likely to be disappointed. Admirers of Almodovar's work
are likely to feel the same way.
   Almodovar's screenplay is primarily a pas de deux between
unlikely lovers. The protagonist is a handsome young mental
patient, Ricky (Antonio Banderas), who manages to talk his way out
of an asylum, where he has serviced the director as well as most of
the nurses.
   Ricky is obsessed with Marina (Victoria Abril), a pornography
star who is trying to become an actress in mainstream films. They
had a brief encounter during one of his escapes from the hospital,
and he is convinced she will marry him.
   How to persuade Marina? By kidnaping her, tying her up in her
own bedroom and waiting for her to submit.
   That is the essence of ``Tie Me Up!'' There is also a subplot
about the movie Marina has been making, and Almodovar scores some
satiric jabs at the absurdities of the film business.
   It's easy to see why the Ratings Board decreed the X. The
lovemaking scene is depicted in graphic style, and the bondage
theme is treated lightly.
   Almodovar is a world-class filmmaker, and his work is replete
with surprises. ``Tie Me Up'' is likely to rank as one of his minor
works, provocative but unrealized. The saccharine ending seems
unworthy of him.
   The actors, many of them seen in previous Almodovar films, are
uniformly excellent. Both Banderas and Abril are skilled as well as
attractive, adding to the voltage of their eventual union.
   ``Tie Me Up!'' (unrated) contains sex, nudity and rough
language. In Spanish with English subtitles. Running time: 105
minutes.

   ``Class of 1999''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   The program notes for ``Class of 1999'' suggest that there's
some kind of serious message to be gleaned from this film.
   Don't believe it.
   ``Class of 1999'' shouldn't be taken seriously. It shouldn't be
taken as satire. It shouldn't be taken any way.
   The ostensible premise of this gory, humorless film is that if
you think high schools are violent today, wait until the turn of
the century.
   In this nightmare world, we find Malcolm McDowell playing Miles
Langford, principal of Kennedy High School in Seattle. Gang warfare
has grown so pervasive that the school's surroundings have been
declared a ``free-fire zone'' where even the cops dare not go.
   ``Welcome to Kennedy High School,'' says a mechanical sounding
voice at the school entrance. ``All weapons must be surrendered
before entering the school grounds.''
   With violent incidents occurring every two hours and 38 seconds
on average, the Board of Education has been renamed the Department
of Educational Defense.
   In desperation, McDowell calls in Dr. Bob Forrest, played
nonchalantly by Stacy Keach sporting a gray-white rat-tail. His
company, ``Mega-Tech,'' has produced three androids who look and
sound like teachers, but who give new meaning to the word
``paddling.''
   At first, this ``final solution'' to the student discipline
problem seems to work. Some kid-hating audiences may even cheer as
these mechanical teachers force-feed pills down the throats of
young druggies, or administer ear-splitting spankings to
foul-mouthed gang members until blood oozes from their mouths.
   Meanwhile, young Cody Culp, a semi-reformed youth gang leader
played by Bradley Gregg, senses something vaguely inhuman about
these teachers. He vainly tries to convince Langford's comely
daughter, Christie, that her father's drastic cure for student
violence just might be worse than the disease.
   After a few more broken necks, impalements and throat gougings,
skeptical Christie is convinced that there's something faintly
unwholesome about these new faculty members, though too late to
save the life of her father who becomes another victim of these
androids run amok.
   The hopelessly muddled plot finally has rival gang members
putting aside their blood feud to defeat the common mechanical foe.
   Mark L. Lester produced and directed ``Class of 1999.'' His
previous credits include direction of ``Class of 1984,'' another
blackboard jungle-type yarn.
   In program notes, Lester suggests some serious message in his
latest project: that the violence plaguing schools today could
easily lead to the horrors shown in this film unless we act to
quell it now.
   Forget it. If this offensive film has any message at all, it's
that the producers apparently believe there's a big movie-going
market for wholesale violence against children.
   ``Class of 1999'' is rated ``R,'' richly earned because of
almost nonstop blood, guts and foul language.

   think of an ending, said he was supposed to have it ready for this
summer, but he won't have it until next summer.
   Next season, Charleston may hear two trios Menotti is composing,
for cello, violin and flute, and for cello, violin and piano.
   He has finished ``A Dirge for the Death of Orpheus,'' for
orchestra, chorus and tenor soloist for the Atlanta Symphony,
inspired by sonnets to Orpheus by Rainer Maria Rilke. In the
cantata, followers of Dionysius tear Orpheus' body to bits and
throw his bleeding head into the sea. The head keeps singing and
floats to a Greek island where a temple was built.
   ``It's a bit of comment on the music of today,'' Menotti says.
``Some people have done all they can to destroy good music but the
head of Orpheus proves that true beauty goes on singing.''
   After the July festival in Spoleto, Italy, Menotti will go to
Davos, Switzerland, for a festival of his music, then to Phoenix
where his ``Cello Fantasy'' will be played. Before Charleston,
he'll attend his son, Chip's, first staging of Menotti's ``The
Medium'' and ``The Telephone'' for the Hollybrook Festival in
Glassboro, N.J.
   One of Menotti's greatest joys is his grandson, Claudio, who
will be 3 on July 14. They often have breakfast together, talking
Italian.
   ``He heard that I was old,'' the composer says. ``He comes to me
and says, `Nonno (grandfather), you're old, but you're only a
little old.''
   On July 7, 1991, Menotti will be 80. Next year, a number of
opera companies will perform his operas ``The Medium,'' ``The Saint
of Bleeker Street'' and ``The Consul.''
   What he most desires is to build a private theater in Scotland.
``Then I could do all my staging there and go to my festivals.
   ``All I need is $1 million, not two or three, only one. I hope
for my 80th birthday, somebody will say, `Menotti, here it is.'''

   ``Let's talk about love,'' Robert Plant says on
the opening track of his newest album. And so he does.
   ``Manic Nirvana'' is full of reflections on love: physical love,
fantasy love, love gone sour. But don't expect the usual, or the
serious, from this rock veteran.
   He's always been known as the master of capricious naughtiness
and musical wackiness, but his solo efforts since the breakup of
Led Zeppelin in 1980 have been relatively tame. No more.
   On ``Manic Nirvana,'' Plant returns to playfully sexual lyrics
liberally sprinkled with wit and innuendo, and blended with
abundant puns.
   In ``Big Love,'' he juxtaposes a romantic encounter with being
at ``15,000 and holding'' on an airplane. He imagines a
relationship with a magazine model in the frustrated ``I Cried.''
And in what is probably his most accessible song to date, ``Hurting
Kind (I've Got My Eyes on You),'' Plant moans over his love just
like old times.
   The album also contains the first acoustic song of his solo
career, ``Liars Dance,'' a quiet but terse commentary on greed and
religion.
   And as always, Plant rejoices in keeping his audience guessing.
In his remake of the 1961 Kenny Dino song, ``Your Ma Said You Cried
in Your Sleep Last Night,'' he slips in the first two verses of the
Zeppelin classic ``Black Dog'' _ just to keep you on your toes.
   ``(The music) must change and it must give me the variety and
the humor and the pomp and the mock splendor and all that sort of
thing, depending upon the mood that I'm in,'' Plant said in an
interview.
   The constant changing makes his music difficult to categorize _
and he likes it that way. But he teasingly called it ``angst-pomp.''
   ``Part of the reason that I change it so much is to be quirky
and to maintain the quirk,'' he said. ``It certainly doesn't help
me sell more records. In fact, if it does anything at all, it
diminishes the chance, because I'm not playing the natural,
straight-down-the-line, middle-of-the-road game.''
   That sense of humor has helped Plant to make himself less
serious. ``There are parts of my personality that need a lot of
tender loving care and attention from myself to myself,'' he said,
``and there are other parts that really are very flippant and have
to be a bit derisive.
   ``I'm serious because I want to make this music sound exactly as
it does now, but at the same time, I can't be too serious about it
because there are so many holes in it and there's such folly in a
rock n' roll singer's ego.''
   It seems that Plant can now accept the strutting, bare-chested
attitude of his youth and temper it with the cleverness and
imagination of maturity. But despite his 42 years, he is by no
means a prude.
   He's called his new album ``thunder and lightning condensed in a
condom.'' In other words, it's lusty. But it gets its sexiness from
Plant's fantasies and double entendre, rather than blatant
vulgarity.
   In ``Big Love,'' he talks of a bathroom rendezvous aboard an
airplane. ``I just felt that it was fair game because it's
something that everybody dreams of happening, even if you have the
most straight-laced, moralistic point of view,'' he said.
   However, he said he's not out to exploit or degrade women. ``You
have to be careful not to take it as if I'm heralding male
dominance and it's only for my benefit. Everybody would benefit
from those sort of impromptu meetings.''
   Plant wistfully spoke of his ``complete incapacity to have a
nice, calm love affair.'' He quoted from his song ``She Said,''
which he said describes him:
   ``So I say, `Give me fresh horses, let me ride the wild beat.
Women in their houses, I can't deal with their heat.'''
   ``I like the seduction,'' he said. ``I like the kind of intrigue
of relationships and I don't like what they do to me _ or what I do
to them.''
   Part of Plant's new musical freedom has come from his band,
formed before the release of ``Now and Zen.'' Guitarist Doug Boyle,
bassist Charlie Jones, keyboardist Phil Johnstone and drummer Chris
Blackwell are roughly 20 years younger than their leader. But Plant
said his outlook keeps him young.
   ``I think my attitude is my Fountain of Youth, with or without a
band, because I feel kind of timeless,'' he said.
   ``I know I'm getting older, but I don't think that's affecting
my state of mind. I surround myself with young guys because they're
keen and they're excited and their contribution to everything is
very wholehearted. That marriage of enthusiasm and lack of cynicism
and lack of worldly over-wisdom _ it's perfect for me.''
   As Plant's personality is a combination of adult wisdom and
youthful energy, so are his heroes. He is a devotee of early
bluesmen Howlin' Wolf and Gene Vincent, but said he admired anyone
``who could swing their hips and make me wonder what that meant.''
He also praised Robert Smith of The Cure.
   Of the wide variety of his heroes, he quipped: ``Some of them
are dead, some of them are tired, and some of them are young.''
   Plant's 1990 tour kicks off in Europe on May 1 and should be in
the States shortly after.
   ``I'm very lucky,'' he said. ``I have a particularly strong live
following and I haven't had huge Top 40 hits, but I've got a pretty
big, interested, live following, which is great _ it's kind of
greater than if I'd had Top 40 hits and nothing else.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Food an Important Legacy of the 1960s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What's on the dinner table in the 1990s may
represent one of the most tangible legacies of the 1960s, even for
those who never sprouted a bean.
   The rebellion by health food ``nuts'' against ``plastic'' food
was part of a bigger effort to live better that included the civil
rights, environmental and women's movements, Warren J. Belasco
argues in ``Appetite for Change: How the Counterculture Took on the
Food Industry, 1966-1988,'' published by Pantheon Books.
   In his preface, including the story of his discovery of
alternative ways of eating, Belasco connects the dinner table to
the political changes of the 1960s.
   ``Indeed, I've found that rather than just being silly or
perverse _ as our parents and skeptical peers probably thought _ we
were cooking up something quite serious, ambitious, and yes,
radical: an alternative food system with its own ideology, staples
and supply lines, a countercuisine.''
   Food, he said, often is ignored by analysts of our history and
culture. Belasco, in fact, began his research intending to write
about how the mainstream co-opted counterculture efforts in rock
'n' roll, clothing and food. ``The food just became too big.''
   The New Left argued over and over that the personal was
political, and Belasco argues, nothing is more personal than food.
``And what could be more political than challenging agribusiness,
America's largest and most evironmentally troublesome industry ...?
   ``I really do think that food is one of the most substantial
parts of our lives, central to our health and our pleasure,'' he
said in a telephone interview from the University of Maryland,
where he is an American studies professor.
   Belasco presents an engaging, and copiously foot-noted, tale
that connects food giveaways in the Haight-Ashbury of the mid-1960s
to the chocolate-covered granola bars that pass for healthy kids'
food today.
   He adds spice to his theories by liberally quoting many
underground food columnists of the 1960s. ``Appetite for Change''
is not just fun, though it is that; it forces readers to consider
what's in their pantries and why.
   Business figured out pretty quickly that the ``countercuisine''
could be profitable. And today, the profusion of so-called health
and ``lite'' foods is ironic evidence of success. Of course, the
legacy also exists in food cooperatives, concern over health,
organic farms and other alternative enterprises.
   But the countercuisine has not turned us into a nation of
healthy, socially conscious eaters, and Belasco tries to explain
why ``the supermarket is an additive minefield, processors are
consolidating rapidly, the farm belt is a disaster area, pesticides
are out of control, and we reek with contradictions like everyone
else.''
   The reasons are complicated, the fault of the ``ecofreaks'' as
well as the food industry. There were plenty of conflicts:
vegetarians vs. meat-eaters, white bread vs. whole-grain brown,
convenience vs. homemade, natural vs. processed, ethnic dishes vs.
``WASP'' food.
   Belasco also criticizes the press and the response in the '70s
to public concerns about the food supply by a government that ``was
itself a bundle of contraditions, inconsistencies and
vacillations.''
   And there were disputes within the counterculture over the role
of food, communes and cooperatives and ``hip capitalists.''
   ``It may now be hard to see revoluntionary significance in the
eating of unhulled rice and curried carrots or granola and yogurt.
In 1969-70, however, dietary change was one of the more substantial
household reforms,'' Belasco writes.
   Twenty years later, Americans are again being coaxed to make
changes that start at home _ consume green, recycle, conserve.
   ``It's good that there is all this news, but I'm kind of
skeptical as to how deep it is as far as Earth Day,'' Belasco said
in the interview. ``I had very mixed feelings about that as a
really meaningful set of activities on that day.''
   ``Green'' sounds today a lot like ``natural'' did 20 years ago _
hard to define and therefore open to fraud. And real change is
slow, he noted.
   ``The problem is the public is not going to see immediate
gains,'' he said. ``People like me, I'm a believer, and I'm in
there for the long pull.''
   Today's news seems all too familiar. ``A lot of this is deja vu
to me _ we went through this 20 years ago. And I think a lot of it
got co-opted,'' he said. ``Beyond defining the content of food,
natural was a liberated state of mind, a symbol of opposition to
mass production, efficiency, rationalization, limits.''
   At the other end of the spectrum: ``Mass-produced, processed
food encouraged alientation from nature, society, one's own body.
Unfortunately, most consumers seemed to collaborate in their own
alientation.''
   But, he said, he is a bit more optimistic today than even two
years ago when he finished his book with the less-than enthusiastic
plea that ``since the odds against us were always steep, I suppose
there's no reason to lose heart now.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Melvin Sloan Dancers Have Fun</HEAD>

   The rules are simple for the Grand Ole
Opry's Melvin Sloan Dancers.
   ``Rule No. 1 is to have fun. Rule 2 and 3 is the same rule,''
says Sloan.
   The energetic, colorful eight-person square dance troupe is
celebrating its 10th year on the live country music show. The
group, possibly the best known square dance act in the world, also
has appeared on the TV shows ``Hee Haw,'' the now-defunct ``Dolly
Parton Show'' and other programs.
   The 50-year-old Sloan says his troupe dances a different style
than amateur square dance clubs around the country. His group
dances to his spontaneous ``calls'' during the routine. Nearly all
the local square dancers use set patterns, he says.
   ``Our style is self taught,'' he said in an interview. ``No one
teaches you how to do this. It's kind of like playing music by ear.
Ours is dancing from the heart. We dance like we feel. You express
yourself by moving your feet.''
   Sloan's brother, Ralph, directed his own Opry square dance group
from 1952 until his death in 1980. Melvin then took over the group
to maintain the tradition of a Sloan-led Opry dance troupe.
   He had never danced before, but he learned quickly.
   ``I had jumped into a lake of water and I didn't know how to
swim,'' he recalled about his first dance steps. ``There was
confusion. There were times we'd dance and then go to the dressing
room and cry.''
   He eventually mastered the art by studying patterns that other
group members had drawn for him on paper. He spent hours in front
of a mirror in his loft, perfecting the dance steps and his
coordination.
   He finally picked up where his brother left off, and the group
continued its reputation as one of the Opry's most popular acts.
   ``There's nothing that puts electricity in a crowd like a loud
banjo and some good dancing,'' Sloan said.
   The troupe ranges in age from mid-20s to 50 and is recruited
from square dance groups in Tennessee. No one else in the country
dances exactly the style done in Middle Tennessee, he said.
   ``I tell my dancers that if you can't give me 100 percent, you
don't need to go to the stage. We are always received well,'' Sloan
said.
   They perform every other weekend on the Opry, a fabled show that
has been presented weekly since 1925. A million people see the
production in person every year and millions more listen on the
radio. Thirty minutes of the three-hour show is carried live each
Saturday night on cable TV's The Nashville Network.
   The Sloan dancers can tell while standing behind the curtain
just before show time whether the crowd will be responsive or
quiet. ``If you hear a lot of laughter and everything sounds alive,
when the curtain goes up, you can feel it. It's a feeling of
energy,'' Sloan said.
   His group, and his brother's before it, boast of never having
missed a scheduled Opry performance in 38 years. But Melvin Sloan's
troupe barely made it to a show about three years ago during an ice
storm.
   ``We rushed in to the Opry House and didn't have time to change
our clothes,'' he recalled. ``We ran out on the stage and danced in
our street clothes to keep the streak going.''
   Sloan designs their costumes. Each of the four men's attire has
a belt and buckle, shirt, necktie, hanky and white pants and white
shoes. These are coordinated with the women's dress, apron or
pinafore and sash, hosiery and matching ties for the shoes, and
pantaloons.
   The group also performs at various Nashville conventions. And in
1983, at the request of then President Ronald Reagan, they
performed at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington.
   Despite the tradition and the acclaim, the group is not perfect.
   ``Sometimes we make a mistake,'' Sloan said. ``But it makes me
feel good when someone tells us it looks like we enjoy our dancing
so much. We are as proud of our dancing as any singer is of his
singing.''

   ``Deep'' (RCA-BMG) _ Peter Murphy
   
   The ``deep'' of former Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy's fourth solo
project could refer to his unfathomable lyrics, but Murphy has said
the title reflects both how he feels about his work _ deeply _ and
his perception of the music, which he calls ``deep rock.''
   It sounds more like doomsday disco.
   Murphy's old outfit, a post-punk British band with artistic
pretensions, was among the first to mix infectious dance grooves
with brooding, introspective lyrics.
   The style lives on in this recording and in records by The Cure,
The The and others favored by masses of black-garbed club hoppers.
   ``Cuts You Up,'' a single from ``Deep,'' is a hit in dance clubs
and on college radio, and its hook is undeniable. But it is
difficult to imagine the self-absorbed Murphy finding a broader
audience with songs this obtuse.

   ``Ace of Harps'' (Alligator) _ Charlie Musselwhite
   
   Charlie Musselwhite sings like his vocal chords are on a leash.
But his singing is no reason to listen to ``Ace of Harps,'' his
debut with Chicago's Alligator records. A master of the blues
harmonica, his playing knows no bounds.
   He can play down. He can play dirty. He can even play pretty.
Whenever he blows, you hear a tradition born by Little Walter, who
sparked the explosion of urban blues out of Chicago in the 1950s.
Mississippi-born Musselwhite and the late Paul Butterfield built
off that tradition in the 1960s and Musselwhite carries it on today.
   It's gritty and hard driving and powered by no-nonsense blowing
that says the man with the harp is in charge. For Musselwhite's
definition, listen to ``Leaving Your Town'' or ``Hangin On.''
   Just to show he learned his blues lessons well, Musselwhite
sings ``My Road Lies in Darkness'' accompanied only by his own
playing on acoustic guitar. It's the cut most suited to his deep
drawl. A man with lesser convictions would not ring true, but
Musselwhite proves he hears the calling on his 14th solo album as
strong as he did on his first.
   Behind Musselwhite on ``Ace of Harps,'' stand Andrew Jones Jr.
on guitar, Artis Joyce on bass and Tommy Hill on drums. Joyce and
Hill are solid while staying out of the way and Jones punctuates
Musselwhite's blowing with some well-placed solos.
   What Musselwhite chooses to sing on this record is less
important than how he approaches the material as a whole, since the
fare is pretty standard. But the moment he lights into ``The Blues
Overtook Me'' to start things off you believe him, and being
overtaken yourself is an easy next step.

division from Burbank to Marietta, Ga., in an effort to cut costs
in the face of a likely decline in defense spending, the company
said Tuesday.
   The decision by the company's board will end plane-building
operations at the site that date back to 1928. Burbank is where
``Rosie the Riveter'' cranked out 30,000 warplanes in World War II
and the ``Skunk Works'' designed America's most secret aircraft.

   A jury has decided the Dallas Times Herald was
not harmed unfairly by the loss of 26 comics and features last fall
to its larger rival, The Dallas Morning News.
   The jury voted 10-2 in declining to award damages to the Times
Herald, which contended that the Morning News and its parent, A.H.
Belo Corp., violated anti-trust laws by taking over the features in
a move to drive the Times Herald out of business.
   The Times Herald had asked for $33 million in actual damages and
what its attorneys termed significant punitive damages. The $33
million would have been tripled if the Times Herald lawsuit had
been successful.

<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. said it will phase out all
operations at the site where ``Rosie the Riveter'' cranked out
30,000 warplanes in World War II and the ``Skunk Works'' designed
America's most secret aircraft.
   The nation's sixth largest military contractor said the changes
would help it adjust to a likely decline in defense spending.
   ``We will take advantage of this situation to streamline our
aircraft operations and enhance profitability,'' said Chairman
Donald Tellep.
   Lockheed, which has built planes in Burbank since 1928, said
Tuesday it will move its aerospace division to Marietta, Ga.,
outside Atlanta.
   The move to Georgia, where Lockheed already builds and services
cargo planes at a government-owned facility, will cut costs
substantially, Tellep said.
   The Skunk Works research unit, where spy planes and the stealth
fighter were developed, will become a separate subsidiary and
gradually move from the 320-acre Burbank site to Palmdale, in the
desert 50 miles north of Los Angeles.
   Corporate headquarters will remain in Calabasas, Calif.
   The moves mean more bad news for the aerospace industry in
California. State Rep. George Miller said last week the state could
lost 200,000 defense-related jobs by 1995.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft is eliminating 3,000
jobs, most of them in Long Beach. Lockheed said recently it would
lay off 2,000 workers in Burbank, Palmdale and Santa Clarita, along
with 750 in Marietta.
   Lockheed spokesman Ron Meder said the company would finish
moving all operations out of Burbank by the mid-1990s, ``and then
everything will have been sold or will be for sale.''
   Lockheed's profits plummeted from $624 million in 1988 to $2
million in 1989 last year, and the company faces tough times as
easing world tensions pressure the government to slash defense
spending.
   The company recently won a proxy battle for control waged by
Texas investor Harold Simmons, who owns 19 percent of Lockheed's
stock and claimed the company was mismanaged. Simmons did force the
company to allow big shareholders more participation, however.
   Tellep said Lockheed would continue to develop its new P-7
submarine-hunting plane in California but will build it in Georgia.
   Lockheed also will build the Advanced Tactical Fighter in
Georgia if it wins the competition for one of the last major
aerospace defense contracts in this century. A Lockheed-led team is
competing with one led by Northrop Corp., and a decision is
expected by the middle of next year.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently called for the ATF to go
into production in 1996, two years later than previously planned.
Lockheed said delays also were likely on the P-7.
   Securities analysts said the moves may help Lockheed curry
support for its ATF bid from Sen. Sam Nunn, the powerful Georgia
Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``He's certainly somebody you'd like to have on your side,''
said Paul H. Nesbit of Prudential Bache Research in New York.
``They have that huge facility down there that Sam Nunn has
virtually insisted that the Air Force continue to keep open with
the hope in mind there would be work.''
   Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. was formed in 1987, when
plane-building operations in California and Georgia merged under
one management.
   The division has come on hard times of late, with four major
military plane programs ended or about to end: the C-5 cargo plane,
the P-3 antisubmarine patrol plane, the TR-1 high-altitude
reconnaisance plane and the F-117A stealth fighter.
   Employment at the Marietta plant has fallen from 20,000 workers
two years ago to about 9,000. Lockheed officials said the shift of
the aerospace division wouldn't lead to any immediate surge in
employment in Marietta because no new aircraft production is
scheduled until the mid-1990s.
   Lockheed's operations in Burbank date back to 1928. It produced
30,000 fighters and bombers there during World War II and later
built the Constellation and L-1011 passengers planes. The Skunk
Works designed secret aircraft such as the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes
and the stealth fighter.
   Corporate headquarters were moved from Burbank to Calabasas five
years ago, and Lockheed recently put 225 of its 320 acres in
Burbank up for sale.
   Lockheed has a number of other operations throughout the country
including its missiles and space division in Sunnyvale in Northern
California, which is thriving.

<HEAD>Visa, Mastercard Drop Debit Card Venture In Suit Settlement</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen states claimed victory in their effort
to stop Visa and Mastercard from launching a national debit card,
and one state official hinted the vastly larger credit card market
could be next on the states' antitrust hit list.
   Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Mastercard International agreed to settle
charges brought by the states in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
last June by agreeing to abandon their joint ``Entree'' debit card
network, the state attorneys general announced Tuesday.
   Each company promised to develop separate debit card systems
eventually.
   A point-of-sale debit card is presented at stores like a credit
card, but the money is deducted automatically from the cardholder's
account and transferred to the merchant.
   The antitrust suit claimed Entree had an unfair advantage over
smaller, regional competitors because virtually every major U.S.
bank already was a Visa or Mastercard member.
   The credit card associations are the world's largest with a
combined 370 million cardholders.
   Visa and Mastercard also have gained control of the nation's two
largest automatic teller machine networks _ Cirrus System Inc. of
Downers Grove, Ill., and Plus System Inc. of Denver, both of which
had been formulating their own plans for national debit card
networks since the early 1980s.
   Visa also took over the Interlink Network, based in San Mateo,
Calif., the nation's largest regional debit card network.
   ``There would have been no competitive forces at work,'' Robert
Abrams, the New York attorney general who led the states' action,
told a news conference. ``The agreement doesn't prevent the concept
from going forward. It prevents a monopoly.''
   David Brancoli, a spokesman for Visa, disagreed: ``We feel the
program would have been competitive and we would have prevailed in
the courts.''
   He said Entree was abandoned partly because some banks had begun
to lose interest in it in the face of what could have been a
lengthy court battle.
   The other states involved in the suit were: Arizona, California,
Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   At the end of 1989 there were 183.9 million debit cards in
circulation nationwide, according to Bankcard Holders of America, a
consumer group based in Herndon, Va. But not all those cards
operate ``on-line'' as Entree would have, by electronically
accessing a comsumer's bank account the same way as an automatic
teller machine.
   Visa and Mastercard began developing Entree in 1986 and had
signed up about 200 banks to participate, according to Richard
Woods, a spokesman for Mastercard. Two of those banks, Bank One of
Columbus, Ohio, and U.S. National Bank of Oregon, already had
issued around 100,000 cards, although none has been used, he said.
   Under terms of the settlement signed Tuesday by U.S. District
Judge Pierre N. Laval in Manhattan, Visa and Mastercard will
abandon Entree and notify bank participants it will be terminated
by Oct. 1. In exchange, the states dropped efforts to compel Visa
and Mastercard to divest Cirrus, Plus and Interlink.
   ``The speedy resolution of this complex lawsuit is the first
important step in establishing a more competitive environment in
the nation's electornic payment systems,'' Abrams said.
   He said the states agreed to set up a task force to investigate
competition in that field, particularly with credit cards.
   ``Although there are approximmatly 20,000 financial institutions
offering plastic debit, credit and ATM cards, the interest rates
and other fees charged ... is disturbingly high, uniform and
rigid,'' said Abrams.
   Abrams said Visa and Mastercard had been engaged in a ``creeping
merger'' that already had resulted in largely uniform pricing in
the credit card industry. Average credit card rates, which are set
by banks, have hovered around 19 percent in recent years despite
fluctuations in other interest rates.
   David Robertson, a vice president for the Nilson Report, a bank
industry newsletter published in Santa Monica, Calif., predicted
states eventually will challenge the ``duality'' of the credit-card
industry, which allows financial institutions to be members of both
Visa and Mastercard.
   ``The competition is done with mirrors,'' said Robertson. ``How
can you be a member of both'' and remain competitive.

   The guard is changing at the top of Time Warner
Inc.
   The company's president, Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., succeeds J.
Richard Munro today as co-chief executive of the media and
entertainment giant.
   The top-level changes had been widely expected, and the
50-year-old Nicholas said no major changes are expected because he
and Munro have worked together so closely for years.
   ``This represents continuity, not change,'' Nicholas said.
   The 59-year-old Munro announced he was stepping down at the
first annual meeting of Time Warner shareholders since Time Inc.
completed its acquisition of Warner Communications Inc. earlier
this year.
   Munro had been chief executive at Time since 1980 and chairman
since 1986. He shared both titles with Warner boss Steven J. Ross
since Time bought a controlling interest in Warner and changed its
name last year.
   A onetime Sports Illustrated publisher, Munro had said he wanted
to serve only 10 years as chief executive, and the company spelled
out succession plans when the Warner deal was first announced in
March 1989.
   Munro's contract at Time Warner entitled him to deferred
compensation of nearly $4.3 million if he retired from his posts on
or before this May 31.
   Nicholas, 50, has been with Time since 1964 and president since
1986.
   ``The future belongs to him and to Steve and to the remarkable
people at Time Warner. I wish you all godspeed,'' Munro told
shareholders and others who filled the 1,150-seat Ziegfeld Theater
for Tuesday's 2{-hour meeting.
   Ross, 62, becomes the company's sole chairman with Munro's
retirement. Plans are for him to share the chief executive's post
for four more years, after which he is expected to leave that job
entirely to Nicholas.
   Time spurned a $12.2 billion buyout offer from Paramount
Communications Inc. last summer and proceeded with a $14 billion
purchase of Warner. The deal, completed in January, created a world
leader in magazines, books, films, recorded music, TV production
and cable TV systems.
   Time never allowed shareholders to vote on the Paramount offer,
but there were few complaints expressed Tuesday about Time's
tactics.
   Shareholders rejected a proposal, which was opposed by
management, calling on Time Warner to either redeem or submit to a
shareholder vote a key anti-takeover defense known as a poison pill.
   William Steiner, who presented the resolution, said Time
management had cost its shareholders about $5 billion by rejecting
Paramount's $200-a-share offer without allowing a vote.
   About 43 percent of the shares voted in favor of the proposal
and 57.8 percent against, the company said.
   In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Time Warner
stock fell 50 cents a share to $94.
   Ross said uncertainty about congressional efforts to impose more
regulations on the cable industry had cut the value of Time Warner
stock by $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Time Warner is the nation's
second biggest cable TV system operator.
   One shareholder asked Ross to explain why he deserved his
lucrative benefits package, under which he is entitled to deferred
compensation of about $122 million.
   Ross said the package mainly reflected stock bonuses and stock
appreciation rights he was granted in 1987 at Warner, and noted the
company he founded had grown at a remarkable pace in recent years.
   Munro, who will stay on as a Time Warner director and chairman
of its executive committee, joined the Time magazine circulation
department in 1957.
   He became president and chief executive of Time Inc. in 1980,
and took on the title of chairman in 1986, passing the president's
job to Nicholas.
   Munro defended the decision to combine with Warner rather than
take the Paramount offer, saying the new company offered a
potential ``long-term return on investments that would far outstrip
any single short-term gain the sale or breakup of Time might
bring.''
   Time Warner lost $256 million on revenue of $10.8 billion last
year, mainly because of costs associated with its purchase of a
majority stake in Warner. Nicholas said a top priority is reducing
the company's $10.8 billion debt.

<HEAD>LIN Restructures Purchase of Metromedia's New York Cellular Stake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   LIN Broadcasting Corp. has amended its $1.9
billion offer for Metromedia Co.'s stake in the New York City
cellular telephone franchise to a combination of cash and stock
instead of an all-cash deal.
   The new deal announced Tuesday will ease the debt burden on LIN,
and indirectly on parent McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., as it
takes control of a system in a premiere market.
   McCaw took on a heavy debt in March when it paid $3.4 billion to
boost its stake in LIN to 52 percent.
   The new deal ``increases LIN's financial flexibility as we move
ahead with the development of the nationwide seamless cellular
network,'' said Craig O. McCaw, chairman and chief executive of
both LIN and McCaw Cellular.
   In a related transaction, LIN said Tuesday it had agreed to give
Metromedia control of the Philadelphia cellular franchise by
selling a fraction of its interest in that system to Metromedia for
$15.5 million.
   Metromedia, based in Secaucus, N.J., has interests in
telecommunications and other activities and is headed by
billionaire John Kluge.
   There had been speculation LIN was having trouble raising the
cash needed to buy Metromedia's stake in the New York franchise,
Metro One. It agreed to buy the interest two months before agreeing
to be acquired by the Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw.
   LIN said Metromedia has agreed to accept $1.05 billion in cash
and $850 million in preferred stock rather than the $1.9 billion in
cash originally offered for Metromedia's 46.3 percent interest in
the New York system.
   LIN already owns a 45 percent of Metro One.
   Metromedia will be given preferred stock in a new LIN
subsidiary, LCH Cellular Inc. The new unit will own all of LIN's
cellular businesses; LIN's specialty publishing operation called
GuestInformant, which produces city guides for hotel rooms; and one
of LIN's seven TV stations, WOTV, which serves the Grand
Rapids-Kalamazoo-Battle Creek area in Michigan.
   The preferred stock will provide dividends to Metromedia and
will entitle Metromedia to representation on the LCH Cellular board.
   In a separate deal disclosed Tuesday, LIN said it had agreed to
buy another 1.7 percent stake in the Metro One franchise from other
investors for $60 million. That purchase, combined with the
Metromedia deal, would boost LIN's stake to 93 percent of the New
York franchise.
   In the transaction involving the Philadelphia Metrophone
franchise, LIN agreed to sell a 1.01 percent stake in that system
to Metromedia for $15.5 million at the same time that Metromedia
gets the preferred stock in the New York deal. That would cut LIN's
51 percent stake in the franchise to just under 50 percent, while
boosting Metromedia's 49 percent stake to over 50 percent.
   The transactions are expected to close in the third quarter of
the year and are subject to several conditions including regulatory
approvals and approval by LIN's independent directors, the company
said.
   If the conditions are not met, LIN said it will proceed with
completion of the purchase of Metromedia's New York interests for
cash.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Southland Center, once Dallas's premier office
address, has been sold to a Swedish investor in the largest deal in
the city's central business district since the real estate market
collapsed in the mid-1980s.
   Lars-Erik Magnusson, chief executive of Larmag Investments Group
of Amsterdam, said Tuesday he had paid about $60 million for the
three-building downtown complex and would spend another $130
million to renovate them.
   Magnusson made the purchase in partnership with KTI Associates,
another investment firm.
   ``I think Dallas has had its worst years behind it,'' Magnusson
said by telephone from his home in The Netherlands. ``I've been
looking at Dallas for a couple of years, but last year I felt it
was too early to go in. This year I feel much more comfortable.''
   The largest building, the 42-story Southland Tower, was the
tallest in Dallas when it was completed in 1959 by Southland
Financial Corp. Its companion 31-story Skyway Tower was finished in
1981. The office buildings have about 1 million square feet of
leasable space, but are only 30 percent occupied.
   The 508-room, 29-story Sheraton Dallas Hotel completes the
complex.
   The collapse of the local real estate market in the 1980s left
many skyscrapers almost vacant and sent rental rates plummeting.
   Boosters welcomed the deal as the latest indication of a
recovery, but some said the deal's success depends on the
refurbishing. Magnusson said he planned to replace the
turquoise-tile and florescent-light facade derided by locals, as
well as remove asbestos.
   ``The `recladding' could dramatically increase the appeal of
that building, if they can do all that work, and can get acceptance
by the public as a new project rather than just a rehashing of the
old project,'' said Bob Edge, executive vice president of Cushman &amp;
Wakefield of Texas Inc. real estate firm.
   But Edge said, ``They're going to have do one heck a job of
retrofitting that building to get that kind of acceptance.''
   Magnusson, whose personal worth has been estimated at about $200
million, said he planned to begin work by the end of the year with
completion during 1992.
   ``I think that the lease market in Dallas will be tighter in the
next 18 months and that gives me just the time I need to
renovate,'' he said. ``I'm sure I can deliver top class buildings.''
   The purchase ``is another piece of the recovery,'' said Larry
Fonts, president of the Central Dallas Association, a downtown
business group. ``It is a big deal.''
   Magnusson, who has invested more than $2 billion in Europe, is a
relative newcomer to U.S. real estate, paying $630 million last
year for three trophy properties in New York and Chicago.
   The center once was the headquarters for Southland Life
Insurance Co., later a subsidiary of Southland Financial, an
insurance company owned by Dallas' Carpenter family.
   The life insurance company was sold in 1984, and the office
complex followed in 1988 in a deal with Ashton Development Corp., a
partnership owned by Saudi Arabian investors and New York investor
Ian Kean.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a Washington real estate magnate
will fight charges of illegally passing confidential information
about one of his father's deals to a friend, according to the son's
attorney.
   In a civil complaint filed Tuesday at federal court in Chicago,
the Securities and Exchange Commission accused B. Francis Saul III
of violating the Insider Trading Act of 1984. The SEC also charged
Saul's friend, Peter David Garvy.
   Both men are 28 and Chicago residents.
   ``This kid is totally innocent. He's taken a lie detector test
and passed it 100 percent,'' said Saul's attorney, George Rogers.
``We intend to fight it immediately as soon as we can get to trial
and we expect to win.''
   The complaint concerns transactions involving companies owned by
Saul's father, B. Francis Saul II of Chevy Chase, Md.
   In 1988, the SEC alleged, Saul told Garvy, a former school
roomate, about a proposed tender offer one his father's companies,
Westminster Investing Corp., had made for another Saul concern, the
B.F. Saul Real Estate Investment Trust.
   According to the complaint, Garvy bought 5,500 shares in the
investment trust before the tender offer was made public.
   The complaint also charged that Garvy told his father, Eugene,
70, of Hinsdale, Ill., and a friend, Betsy Perk, 29, of Chicago,
about the pending deal and they purchased shares in the Saul trust.
   The complaint does not accuse the elder Saul, Garvy's father or
Ms. Perk of any wrongdoing.
   Rogers, the younger Saul's lawyer, said he was surprised the SEC
was bringing the case despite a federal appeals court decision in
New York last week that overturned an insider trading case in which
a broker received merger information from a client whose family
owned the company in question.
   ``Sometimes people have to be told twice. No one's ever accused
the government of being smart,'' said Robert Stephenson, Garvy's
attorney in Chicago. He said his client also denied the charges and
would seek a quick trial.
   The SEC charged that Garvy, his father and Ms. Perk made a total
of $61,000 in profits using the information supplied by the younger
Saul.
   The SEC is seeking from both Garvy and the younger Saul, who was
not accused of trading for himself, a total of three times the
total illegal profits, or $183,000, in penalties.

<TEXT>
   After months of hinting at its position, the
Bush administration is siding with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in its jurisdictional dispute with futures regulators.
   Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber told a Senate panel
Tuesday that the administration will introduce legislation to strip
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of control over
stock-index futures and hand it to the SEC.
   The announcement marks a victory for the SEC, which regulates
the nation's stock markets, in a turf battle with the rival CFTC,
which oversees futures markets.
   The dispute centers on which agency should oversee financial
products that have elements of both a security and a futures
contract. These so-called hybrid products include stock-index
futures.
   In testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee, which
oversees the CFTC, Glauber said the administration wants the SEC to
have authority over all stock-related products, including
stock-index futures and stock-index options.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, the committee chairman, said he would ask
the leadership to bring the matter to the Senate floor for action.
He did so after berating both the SEC and CFTC for their
increasingly combative rhetoric and complaining that the measure
might delay much-needed futures market reform.
   Reaction from the futures exchanges was swift and predictable.
   In Chicago, Thomas R. Donovan, chairman of the Chicago Board of
Trade, said the proposal ``would solve a perceived problem only to
create a very real one by placing futures markets under two
regulators.''
   The proposal ``is clearly just the first step of creeping
regulatory imperialism,'' he added in a lengthy statement released
by the CBOT.
   ``Such a move could serve to endanger our nation's Number One
status in the world in financial services,'' said Leo Melamed,
chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's executive committee.
``That is a risk that Congress ought not take,'' he said in a
statement.
   John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, who
sat in on the hearing, said: ``There'll be no jurisdictional change
this year. But it sure mucks up the reauthorization scene, which I
think everybody will agree is unfortunate.''
   In his opening remarks, Leahy complained the dispute has held up
passage of a bill that adds several market reform measures to the
CFTC's reauthorization legislation.
   ``Congress remains blocked from enacting the tough reforms we
all agreed are needed,'' the Vermont Democrat said.
   Leahy also said the committee ``should consider responsible,
appropriate solutions _ possibly even the ultimate merger of the
SEC and CFTC if this is shown to be justified and feasible.''
   CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm told the committee a change in
jurisdiction could cripple her agency.
   ``Splitting off stock index or financial futures from the CFTC
would result in the loss of some of our most experienced personnel
which could damage agency morale and threaten our ability to
oversee the remaining markets within our jursidiction,'' she said.
   In addition to Glauber and Gramm, Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan and SEC Chairman Richard Breeden also testified
before the committee. The four witnesses sit on the White House
Working Group on Financial Markets, which was set up in the wake of
the 1987 stock market crash to handle intermarket issues.

<TEXT>
   Pan American Corp. Chairman Thomas Plaskett says
the company is still looking for partners as it comes off one of
the worst years in its 62-year history.
   Pan Am, which failed in a bid last year to buy Northwest
Airlines, wants to strengthen its route network and has talked to
nearly every other major carrier about some form of combination
ranging from joint marketing to full-scale mergers, Plaskett said.
   ``We are looking at every conceivable idea _ but as for now, we
don't have an agreement with anyone,'' Plaskett said during
Tuesday's annual shareholders' meeting.
   In a meeting repeatedly disrupted by protesting Teamster union
employees, Plaskett said Pan Am would begin reducing losses this
year, but he cautioned that the carrier was on a long, slow route
to recovery.
   Although Plaskett said the company needs capital, company
officials said there are no plans to sell Pan Am's Northeast
shuttle service, as Eastern Airlines sold its Northeast shuttle
last year to New York developer Donald Trump.
   Pan Am has not made a profit since 1980. Pan American World
Airways, its major subsidiary, posted a $437.1 million net loss in
1989, compared to $118.3 million in losses in 1988. Pan Am Corp.
lost $190 million the first quarter of this year.
   Hundreds of Pan Am's nearly 5,000 Teamsters-represented
employees demonstrated outside the Hotel Inter-Continental, then
jammed into the shareholders' meeting. Most employees hold shares
because of past stock-wage programs.
   Plaskett was interrupted repeatedly as he opened his annual
report, including when he discussed the financial losses resulting
from the December 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am's Flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed all 259 on board and 11
people on the ground.
   ``I find it incomprehensible that a tragedy like this would
engender jeers and guffaws,'' Plaskett snapped.
   The Teamsters, representing reservations, ticket, computer and
cargo agents, have been working under company-imposed conditions
for two years since federal mediation failed. Starting wages for
most jobs are under $6 an hour and some are at 1978 levels, the
union said.
   Jack Barmon, chief steward of Teamsters Local 769, said the
union hasn't struck because it fears members would never get their
jobs back. Tuesday marked the beginning of sporadic work stoppages,
he said.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said a small number of
employees failed to report to work on time Tuesday, but their
duties were covered by management personnel with no effect on
operations.
   She said the rowdy protests were ``basically what we expected
because of the big presence of employees in Miami.''
   Plaskett said Pan Am is concentrating on improving and marketing
its customer service reputation, increasing business to Europe,
including Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and expanding its
Pan Am Express as a feeder service.
   In Miami, he said, Pan Am is up to 60 departures daily from 45
last year, making Pan Am the leading carrier out of the city. It
aims to have 150 to 180 daily flights here by 1995, along with
13,000 employees compared to 6,900 now.
   Pan Am is hoping to capitalize on Miami's growth and the woes of
Miami-based Eastern Airlines. Eastern still is struggling to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and is basing its future
on its Atlanta hub. Eastern is down to 48 daily Miami departures
from 110 when its union workers walked out March 4, 1989.
   By mid-summer, Eastern's South American routes will be taken
over by American Airlines.

<HEAD>More Students Take German, Thanks to Fall of Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once shunned by foreign-language students, German
is making a comeback at some schools thanks to the fall of the
Berlin Wall and the move to reunifying the two Germanys, educators
say.
   Though German still takes a backseat to Spanish and French at
most high schools and colleges, students are becoming increasingly
aware of its value as a possible career tool, said Helmut Ziesle,
president of the northern Illinois chapter of the American
Association of Teachers of German and a professor at suburban
Wheaton College.
   There's been a 30 percent increase this year in the number of
Wheaton students majoring in German, he said.
   ``Once Germany's united, its economic role will become more
important,'' Ziesle said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   ``The more we are aware here how important that is, the more
interest we stimulate in the study of German, I think it will help
both countries tremendously,'' he said. ``Most Germans know
English, but relativley few Americans know German.''
   At south suburban Homewood-Flossmoor High School, the expected
enrollment in first-year German will be 19 next year, up from 12
this year, said Principal Charles Smith.
   The Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora will add a
second section of first-year German next year, said teacher John
Stark.
   And the Chicago public school system's German language summer
camp in suburban Lake Forest is filled up with 20 students, said
David Oliver, coordinator of the Department of Language and
Cultural Education for the Chicago Board of Education.
   ``It's way over what we expected,'' he said. ``Last year we had
a problem getting more than eight students.''
   ``I think it's based on what's taking place in Germany,'' Oliver
said. ``I think there's a whole new spirit.''
   Before World War I, German was the most popular foreign language
in American schools. Both world wars, and especially Nazi Germany,
helped change that, Ziesle said.
   So did the growth in the number of Hispanic immigrants in this
country, which helped give Spanish top-billing, said Sherry
Parriott, president of the Southern Illinois chapter of the German
teachers association.
   In 1985, the most recent statistics available, about 4 million
high school and college students were taking Spanish, about 1.5
million were taking French and about 500,000 German, said Helene
Zimmer-Loew, executive director of the association. The Cherry
Hill, N.J.-based group has about 6,500 members, mostly high school
and college teachers.
   ``The news I've heard from most colleges and universities is
that there's been a greater request for German courses,'' Ms.
Zimmer-Loew said.

<HEAD>Sales Flat, Employment Down For Black Enterprise Industrial 100 In
1989</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Black Companies-List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's black-owned businesses slumped notably
last year and must get ``leaner, stronger, better'' to cope with
big debt burdens and a less favorable stance by the government,
Black Enterprise magazine reported.
   Hit by the sluggish economy, the nation's biggest black-owned
businesses saw employment fall sharply and sales decline last year,
the magazine said Tuesday.
   In its annual tally of the biggest black-owned U.S. businesses,
the magazine said the coming years posed even more hurdles because
of cutbacks in areas such as defense spending and what it deemed
weakening government commitments to affirmative action and minority
aid programs.
   ``Black entrepreneurs will have to rethink their strategic focus
and restructure their organizations if they are to keep their
competitive edge and reap profits from the ensuing chaos,'' said
Earl G. Graves, editor and publisher. ``In other words, black
business is going to have to get leaner, stronger, better.''
   Among the 100 biggest industrial and service companies,
employment fell by 10.4 percent while sales dropped 3.8 percent to
$4.46 billion, the magazine stated.
   For the 100 biggest black-owned auto dealerships, which are
listed separately, sales rose by 8.4 percent to $2.33 billion but
total staff dropped 1.3 percent, reflecting the slowdown in the
nation's auto industry.
   Nineteen of the biggest companies from 1988 _ two-thirds of them
auto dealerhips _ sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors
during the year.
   Retaining the top spot among industrial and service companies
was TLC Beatrice International Holdings Co., the foods processor
and distributor. The New York-based holding company acquired the
international food businesses of the former Beatrice Cos. in a
debt-financed $985 million buyout in 1987.
   TLC Beatrice's gross sales of $1.51 billion accounted for about
a third of the total sales of the BE 100 biggest industrial and
service companies.
   But like many of the other companies, TLC Beatrice suffered from
weak conditions in the economy and financial markets. A planned
public offering of 35 percent of the company, which would have made
TLC Beatrice the first black-owned company on the New York Stock
Exchange, was withdrawn in December due to a sagging stock market
and a weak reception by investors.
   ``In short, BE 100s companies, like much of American industry,
are paying for the excesses of the 1980s,'' the magazine stated.
``Debt-ridden and immurred in cyclical industries, many BE 100s
companies realize that the flush times are over _ or at least,
stalled.''
   ``Not only will black businesses have to confront an economy
chugging at a much slower pace, but they must profit as national,
state and local government agencies begin to ``reregulate'' sagging
industries and develop an increasingly laissez faire attitude about
affirmative action and minority set-asides,'' the magazine said.
   Johnson Publishing Co. Inc. of Chicago, the publisher,
broadcaster and maker of cosmetics and hair-care products, retained
second place on the list with $241.3 million in revenue.
   J. Bruce Llewellyn's Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc.,
the soft- drink bottler, kept third place with $240 million in
sales.
   H.J. Russell &amp; Co. of Atlanta, involved in construction,
property management and food and beverages, held fourth place,
although its revenue of $132.9 million was down 16.8 percent from
the previous year.
   Ranked fifth again was Gordy Co., the former Motown Industries
Inc., with sales of $100 million.
   Computer and office supply companies accounted for 18 of the
biggest 100 industrial and service businesses, followed by 17
manufacturing companies, 16 food and beverage companies and 10
media companies.
   California led all states with 23 of the companies belonging to
one or the other of the two top-100 lists. Michigan had 22,
followed by New York with 19, Illinois with 17, Ohio with 13 and
Texas with 11.

   The Secret Service is conducting a
coast-to-coast investigation into the unauthorized use of
credit-card numbers and long-distance dialing codes as well as
illegal entry into computer systems by hackers, according to
sources.
   Search warrants were obtained by the Secret Service to conduct
searches Tuesday in 13 cities: Phoenix, Ariz., Chicago, Cincinnati,
Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, N.J., New York, Pittsburgh,
Richmond, Va., Plano, Texas; San Diego and San Jose, Calif.
   The investigation is being supervised by Stephen McNamee, the
U.S. attorney in Phoenix, and Bob Corbin, the Arizona attorney
general.
   The two officials scheduled a news conference today in Phoenix
to discuss the searches, the Secret Service said.
   Secret Service spokesman Richard Adams declined to discuss
details of the case.
   The investigation in Phoenix is also focusing on incidents in
which computer hackers allegedly changed computerized records at
hospitals and police 911-emergency lines, according to one source.
   Up to 150 Secret Service agents participated in the searches
Tuesday, according to one source.

didn't intentionally infringe on an inventor's patent rights to his
intermittent windshield wiper.
   However, the partial verdict decided on Tuesday still means
Robert W. Kearns could collect a considerable amount of money, said
Cincinnati patent lawyer Jim Hayes.
   ``It does not alleviate the jury's initial ruling but it does
mean that he will collect less,'' Hayes said.
   The U.S. District Court panel adjourned after releasing its
partial verdict in the claims by Kearns, and was scheduled to begin
a sixth day of deliberations today to decide how much money the
inventor should receive.
   The same jury on Jan. 29 ruled that Ford had violated the patent
held by Kearns, a former Wayne State University professor who now
lives in Gaithersburg, Md.
   Kearns claims in his 12-year-old suit against Ford that he
installed a set of his wipers on a 1962 Ford and took it to the
automaker. He said he believed that Ford would buy his system since
engineers questioned him at length about it.
   Kearns, 62, also is suing General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp.,
Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and a dozen other automakers and auto-related
companies. The case against Ford was the first to go to trial.
   After the jury's January decision, Judge Avern Cohn issued an
order forbidding Kearns or Ford officials from talking about the
case.

<HEAD>French, British Aerospace Firms To Study New Supersonic Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Aerospace and Aerospatiale of France said
Wednesday they will conduct a five-year study to decide whether to
develop a new supersonic airliner to replace their jointly produced
Concorde.
   A final decision on whether to proceed with a $10 billion
production program would be made in 1995, Aerospatiale President
Henri Martre told a news conference.
   He said the feasibility study would cost about $34 million and
focus on such issues as market potential, technical factors and
environmental protection.
   Martre said the British and French companies would welcome
cooperation with other industrial powers, including the United
States, Soviet Union, West Germany and Japan.
   British Airways and Air France together operate 13 Concordes on
trans-Atlantic routes. These planes are due for retirement within
15 to 20 years, and the new planes, if developed, would be ready by
about 2005.
   The new generation of supersonic transport would, according to
aviation experts, be capable of carrying about 225 passengers over
distances of up to 7,500 miles at two and a half times the speed of
sound.

<HEAD>Central Bank Says Falling Land Prices Could Cause Problems For
Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan, with some of the most expensive real estate
in the world, could suffer economic problems if land prices fall as
history indicates they might, the Bank of Japan said Wednesday.
   ``Experiences abroad suggest that it is important to forestall
any turbulence which might arise from a sudden change in land
prices, in order to maintain a safe and sound financial system,''
the central bank said in a report.
   Land prices in Tokyo jumped 23.8 percent in 1987 and 65.3
percent in 1988 before the increase slowed to less than 2 percent
last year, according to the National Land Agency.
   Nationwide, land prices soared 17 percent in 1989 after a 21.7
rise in 1988 as speculative inflation spread to other Japanese
cities.
   The most expensive commercial property in the world, in central
Tokyo's Marunouchi and Ginza business districts, was valued at
$23,700 a square foot, the agency said.
   The Bank of Japan said history shows that it is wrong to assume
land prices will keep climbing and never decline. This assumption
among corporate and individual investors is driving economic
decisions and poses a risk to the economy, it said.
   The bank called for legal and tax reforms to end incentives for
property speculation and encourage more efficient land use.
Meanwhile, it said, financial institutions should be monitored
closely to ensure that a drop in land prices doesn't undermine the
value of the currency.
   The scarcity of land is one basic factor behind the high prices.
   ``But more fundamentally, institutional factors such as the tax
and legal systems seem to work to push up land prices by inhibiting
the more efficient utilization of land,'' the Bank of Japan said.
   It said cases in the United States and Britain show that when
land prices climb steeply over a short period, they may decline,
harming financial institutions such as savings and loan firms
involved in property lending.
   A sudden decline in land prices could be triggered by tighter
monetary policy, which raises interest rates, as well as changes in
the economy and legal and tax systems, the bank said.
   Rising prices in other areas have led the bank to raise its
official discount rate four times in the past year, to its current
5.25 percent from a historic low of 2.5 percent. The rate is what
commercial banks pay to borrow from the central bank.

   The stock market was little changed today,
pausing after more than a week of steady gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .68 to 2,732.88
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in nationwide trading of New

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beecham PLC, the newly merged health,
household products and pharmaceuticals company, said Wednesday its
first quarter profit jumped 42 percent because of the sale of
certain businesses.
   SmithKline said that during the three months ended March 31 it
netted $371 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with earnings of
$261 million, or 20 cents, a year ago.
   Sales rose 19 percent to $2.15 billion from $1.8 billion.
   The results were the first the company reported on a quarterly
basis since the merger of SmithKline Beckman Corp. and Beecham PLC
in July 1989.
   Year-earlier figures were made available as if the merger had
taken place at the beginning of 1989.
   SmithKline Beecham attributed the higher quarterly income
largely to aset sales. It sold branded businesses such as Ambrosia,
Bovril and Marmite food products as well as the Yardley-Lentheric
cosmetics, raising around $493 million.
   The company said that it reduced its debt by $455 million during
the first quarter. Its total debt stands at $2.5 billion, down from
$4 billion a year ago.
   SmithKline Beecham Chairman Henry Wendt said that ``interest
expense will decline significantly during the year, and the balance
sheet will improve as we generate a high level of cash from
operations and aggressively pursue debt reduction.''
   The pound figures were converted at a rate of $1.65, which was
provided by the company.

<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Brands Inc.'s shareholders have
defeated a proposal to get rid of the company's tobacco businesses,
but the resolution received enough votes to be raised again next
year.
   Nearly 4 percent of the stockholders at Tuesday's annual meeting
supported the resolution, which asked American Brands to stop
producing and marketing tobacco by the year 2000.
   ``I'm encouraged. We'll submit it again next year,'' said Jeanne
Pinard, a Massachusetts teacher who introduced the proposal.
   American Brands makes several brands of cigarettes, including
Carlton, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Tareyton and Malibu. It also
sells alcoholic beverages, life insurance, office products, golf
supplies, hardware and housewares.
   In urging voters to defeat the resolution, Chairman William J.
Alley said tobacco products represented an important segment of the
company's business and contribute a significant portion of the
American Brand's revenue.
   ``Smoking is a matter of choice for each individual,'' he said.
   Alley was bullish about the company's prospects for 1990. Last
year's revenue fell slightly to $11.9 billion, but income increased
9 percent to $630.8 million.
   First quarter income rose 13 percent to $195 million.

   The Clearwater Sun has stopped the
presses after 76 years of publication.
   ``We were unable to make an effective business,'' Bruce E.
Coury, publisher of Clearwater Newspapers Inc., said in a statement
Tuesday.
   Last summer, the newspaper switched from daily publication to a
tabloid-size weekly focusing exclusively on news in Clearwater, a
central Gulf Coast city also covered by two nearby major dailies _
the St. Petersburg Times and The Tampa Tribune.
   Last Friday's edition was the last ever, Coury said.
   Circulation exceeded 50,000 in 1980, but fell to about 25,000 by
1987, and later dipped below 15,000.
   The newspaper was operated by the Hearst Corp.

<HEAD>Uncertainty Over Soviet Wheat Bid Sends Futures Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices retreated on reports the U.S. Agriculture
Department has rejected a bid by the Soviet Union for 550,000
metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program.
   Corn futures were trading lower. But corn could draw support
from news the buying cap for the Soviet Union in this year's grain
agreement has been raised to 22 million metric tons from 20 million.
   Soybeans futures are expected to get support from a weaker U.S.
dollar, which could generate additional export business.
   Barney Janecki, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
trading may be sluggish today in anticipation of Thursday's
Agriculture Department crop reports.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cent lower to unchanged with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.77{ a bushel; corn was a { cent
lower to a { cent higher with May at $2.88{ a bushel; oats were }
cent to 1{ cents lower with July at $1.75 a bushel; soybeans were a
{ cent lower to } cent higher with May at $6.33 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork futures mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were higher due to firm cash prices and the
belief that Tuesday's selloff was overdone.
   Pork futures declined in followthrough selling from Tuesday's
sharp drop, and lower cash prices.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .40 cent higher with June at 74.32
a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .35 cent higher with
May at 84.55 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .40 cent
higher with June at 63.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
1.45 cents lower to .78 cent higher with May at 66.85 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled lower in Tuesday's trading.

<TEXT>
   Volkswagen AG, West Germany's
largest automaker, reported Wednesday that its first quarter profit
rose 5.5 percent over last year and that 1989 income grew by a
record 33 percent.
   Earnings for the first three months of 1990 totaled $191
million, compared with $181 million last year. Sales were up 7
percent to $10.3 billion worldwide.
   Volkswagen also disclosed its total net income for 1989 jumped
by a record 33 percent to $609 million from $475 million in 1988.
Sales for 1989 rose 10 percent to $39.6 billion $36 billion.
   It was the first time the company disclosed actual financial
data for 1989. Chairman Karl Hahn had indicated earlier, though,
that net income had risen by more than 30 percent last year.
   Hahn, buoyed by record sales from last year, also announced
Tuesday that Volkswagen was considering expanding in Eastern
Europe, just as it plans to grow in East Germany.
   ``It would undoubtedly be a mistake if we _ in a Europe with
nearly 500 million people _ looked only at East Germany with its 16
million people,'' Hahn told a news conference.
   Hahn said Volkswagen was conducting talks in Hungary, Bulgaria
and Czechoslovakia, but he did not elaborate.
   Volkswagen already is arranging joint production with the East
German carmaker IFA-Kombinat, and is shooting for an annual output
of 250,000 units after 1994, Hahn said.

<TEXT>
   Shedding nicknames like ``Chateau de
Bubba'' and ``Cowboy Cabernet,'' a West Texas winery has proven
beyond a sip of sauvignon that wine from the South Plains can get
some respect _ even from the French.
   This month, three labels from Llano Estacado Winery's
award-winning stock have begun appearing in 350 restaurants in
France.
   ``We know (Llano wines) are going to be a success,'' said
Jean-Michel Maumont of Selected Distributors and Vintners in
Cognac, France. ``At first, it will be curiosity. But, after
tasting this wine, they will realize its quality.''
   Maumont is importing red, blush and white wines from Llano for
restaurants SDV already supplies with the makings of Southwestern
cuisine, from Tecate, Lone Star and Carta Blanca beers to pinto
beans, picante sauce and taco shells.
   The French importer and Llano say they hope to capitalize on a
European craze for Tex-Mex cuisine.
   Maumont sought out Llano after the winery won a gold medal at
the International Wine and Spirit Competition in London last
October.
   The export deal is a coup for a winery that still touts its
best-selling blush wine as the perfect companion to chicken fried
steak.
   Kicking a cowboy image has been tough for the winery, says John
Lowey, Llano president and chief executive officer. The operation
started in 1976. It began commercial production in 1983 and grew
despite the economic downturn that stalled the growth of some other
Texas wineries.
   Lowey said West Texas has an ideal environment for grape
growing, with a 3,200-foot elevation and regular daily temperature
swings of 30 degrees.
   ``In grapevine physiology that causes the wine grapes to build
sugar as the cooler temperatures help them retain acid,'' he said.
``A good sugar-acid balance is the secret to a strong vintage.''
   But, he said, ``When we first started we couldn't give a bottle
of wine away here in Lubbock.
   ``We couldn't beg our way onto a wine list in 1982 and 1983. It
was very difficult to establish any credibility at all.''
   Llano's big break came at the 1986 San Francisco Fair Exposition
and National Wine Competition, where it snatched a double gold
medal, the highest honor, for its 1984 chardonnay.
   ``It was like winning the Kentucky Derby,'' Lowey said.
   Still, U.S. publications dubbed Llano products ``Cactus Blanc''
and ``Chateau de Bubba.'' Lowey is happy such stories _ and names _
have not circulated in Europe.
   ``I think we have much more highly developed skepticism in the
United States than in France,'' he said. ``In Europe, we are judged
on our merits.''
   ``Most Frenchmen don't know that wine is made in Texas,''
Maumont said in a telephone interview from SDV headquarters.
   Llano produces ``a very good wine,'' he said. ``I found other
Texas wines that disappointed me greatly. It's certainly one of the
best wines of Texas.''
   Maumont contends Llano's cabernet sauvignon, the winery's
trademark, will satisfy the most discriminating French palates.
   ``Its style is a little different,'' he said. ``The (Texas)
bordeaux has a more complex aroma. It has a taste that is quite
extraordinary.''
   French customers will get to try three Llano wines: a 1987
cabernet sauvignon, 1989 red and 1989 blush.
   Llano, which sells 95 percent of its wine in Texas, recently
completed another transatlantic deal to stock 300 to 400 cases of
cabernet and chardonnay in a chain of wine boutiques throughout the
United Kingdom. International Distiller and Vinter's Hunter and
Oliver wine shops will carry the Llano stock within a few months,
Lowey said.
   Llano's success at home and abroad has been helped by its
relatively low prices. Llano's 14 labels range from $5 to $25 for
the top-of-the-line sauvignon. That allows European dealers to
cover their shipping costs and still make a profit, Lowey said.
   He doesn't know how much his wines will cost in France, but said
they'll be expensive.
   Llano's French debut _ a May 21 tasting at the American embassy
in Paris _ expands a connection between the Lone Star state and the
French wine industry that began almost 100 years ago.
   In the 1890s, the disease phylloxera, which kills the
grapevine's root, was decimating French vineyards.
   Texas horticulturist T.V. Munson developed a disease-resistant
rootstock and sent it to France. Munson was credited with saving
the French wine industry and officially recognized by the French
government.
   ``There is a real knowledge that we owe Texas greatly for this
help,'' Maumont said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls In Europe</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with late rates.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against other major
currencies in Europe on Wednesday, hit initially by a rush of
Japanese selling and later by general bearishness over the American
currency's prospects.
   Gold prices ended the day narrowly lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers linked early European pressure on the
dollar to continued Japanese interest in selling dollars for Swiss
francs.
   Dealers said some technical selling also was kicked off when the
dollar moved below the important support levels of 1.655 West
German marks and 157 Japanese yen.
   ``The sentiment is anti-dollar at the moment,'' said Laudy Bahl,
head corporate dealer for the Bank of Tokyo in London.
   She said the Japanese selling, and later, broader-based selling
when the U.S. markets opened, were exerting significant pressure on
the dollar.
   A dealer at a large European bank in Frankfurt cited the
possibility of a weakening U.S. economy and the potential for
interest rate cuts there as a factor in the dollar's decline.
   Analysts have pointed to the April U.S. employment report,
released Friday, which showed lower job growth that month than
economists anticipated.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 157.03 yen, down 1.02 yen from
Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted lower at
156.40 yen.
   The British pound cost $1.6785 in London, more expensive than
$1.6697 late Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.6375 West German marks, down from 1.6580; 1.4039 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4332; 5.5010 French francs, down from 5.5710;
1.8470 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8635; 1,203.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,216.00; 1.1660 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1630
   Selected dollar rates in New York at midday: 156.65 yen,
1,204.00 Italian lire; 1.6380 West German marks, 1.1660 Canadian
dollars and 1.3997 Swiss francs. The pound was trading at $1.6794.
   Gold traded at $370.75 per troy ounce in London late Wednesday,
up from $369.75 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold traded at $370.75, up
from $369.00 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, gold in Hong Kong dropped $2.49 an ounce to close at
$370.93.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid price of $5.02 a troy
ounce, up from $5.01 late Tuesday.

   Woolworth Corp. said Monday its first-quarter
earnings rose 5.6 percent as its revenue increased by 10 percent.
   Woolworth said it earned $38 million, or 29 cents per share, in
the quarter ended April 28, up from $36 million, or 28 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   The retailer said its sales totaled $2.07 billion, up from $1.88

   The company's biggest gains were posted by its specialty stores,
where sales increased 16 percent and operating income rose 13
percent. Woolworth's specialty chains include Foot Locker, Lady
Foot Locker and Kinney shoe stores.
   Woolworth's general merchandise stores, which include its
flagship F.W. Woolworth chain, had a 5.4 percent sales gain and a
2.6 percent rise in operating income.
   Woolworth said it had 6,622 specialty stores and 1,653 general
merchandise stores open at the end of the first quarter.

<HEAD>Receives $20 Million from United Arab Emirates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan announced Wednesday that it had
received a $20 million grant from the United Arab Emirates and said
more Arab aid was expected to help overcome a financial crisis.
   Jordan has relied on oil-rich Arab states as its primary
financial donor. A shortfall of previously pledged Arab aid to
Jordan has led to a decline in foreign currency reserves. The
country's foreign debt totaled $8.3 billion at the end of 1988.
   As a result of the debt burden, Jordan in November 1988
introduced an economic adjustment program and sought international
creditors' help to reschedule its debts.
   Central Bank Governor Mohammad Said Nabulsi said Wednesday he
was unhappy with an initial draft agreement with creditors in
London for finalizing a $580 million rescheduling package.
   He said the bank's foreign currency reserves totaled $390
million, including the new aid received, up from a $200 million
deficit last year. Reserves hit bottom around April 1989, when the
country sustained four days of rioting sparked by economic problems.
   Nabulsi said the latest total does not include additional Arab
Central Banks deposits totaling $100 million considered as second
line reserves for the next five years.
   Nabulsi said the expected Arab aid will not exceed $400 million.
   He said that finalizing the $580 million rescheduling package
with the London Club, a committee of six bank creditors, was
expected later this month. Jordan's total debt to the group is $1.1
billion, he said.
   Nablusi said that by the end of 1990, remittances from Jordanian
expatriates were expected to increase to $800 million, compared to
$650 million in 1989.
   Jordan, with a population of 3.1 million, also depends on an
estimated 350,000 Jordanians working in the oil-rich Gulf countries
who bring millions of dollars home. In 1987, remittances totaled $1
billion.

<HEAD>Walton Opens Visitor Center Displaying Wal-Mart History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sporting his traditional Wal-Mart cap
and a red, white and blue employee badge bearing the name ``Sam,''
the founder of the Wal-Mart discount chain on Wednesday reopened
the 5&amp;10 store that started it all.
   Sam Walton held court from a flatbed trailer stage in a steady
drizzle to formally open the Wal-Mart Visitor Center in the same
building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for
business on May 9, 1950.
   ``I bird-hunt in the rain,'' Walton said when offered an
umbrella. ``I don't need that thing.''
   Aided by displays and audio-video presentations, the center
chronicles the rise of the fast-growing chain, now the nation's
second-largest discount retailer after K mart Corp., from its
beginnings as a small rural shop. The first Wal-Mart Discount City
opened in 1962.
   The window displays date back to the store's opening, with
Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some
Ivory Snow. Inside, an electronic map details the company's current
1,500-plus store chain.
   Also on display is the hula skirt Sam Walton donned for his
``dance on Wall Street,'' which he performed after the company met
his challenge to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
   The ceremony, which attracted about 400 people and included a
keynote address by Gov. Bill Clinton, lasted less than 45 minutes
after Walton admonished master of ceremonies Don Soderquist,
Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, to hurry things up.
   ``We've always been lucky about rain _ it hardly ever rains at
any other function we've every planned, but today of all days ...
How can you trim this thing down?'' Walton asked.
   Most of the speakers were Walton family members or Wal-Mart
associates who concentrated on the company's history.
   Sam Walton said Wal-Mart's growth was beyond anything he
expected when he opened his five-and-dime.
   ``What 40 years have brought us, we never could have dreamed,''
he said, noting that he purchased the five-and-dime for $16,000
when it was doing $32,000 annually in sales. ``Helen and I were out
of debt _ we'd made a little money in Newport (the site of his
first retail store), and we were out of debt for about six months''
when the expansions that grew into Wal-Mart began.
   He told of taking his wife and four children on scouting trips
to potential store sites, when ``the kids would start chanting,
``Dad, no more store looking.''
   The expansion could never have occurred, he said, if his
Bentonville store had not been profitable.

<HEAD>Board Elects Whitmore Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. directors on Wednesday
elected company president Kay R. Whitmore to succeed Colby H.
Chandler as chairman and chief executive officer when Chandler
retires May 31.
   Kodak had designated Whitmore, 57, as its next chairman last
December. Whitmore has been president of the photography giant
since 1983 and will continue to hold that post.
   At the company's annual meeting in Orlando, Fla., Chandler
forecast an improving financial picture following a restructuring
last year to turn around sagging profits.
   The restructuring cut worldwide employment 5 percent,
streamlined Kodak subsidiaries and division and significantly
reduced inventories.
   ``As 1990 unfolds, and our gains from restructuring take hold,
we look forward to higher sales, better earnings and improved cash
flows, especially in the latter part of the year,'' he said.
   Kodak in the first quarter reported a 6 percent drop in earnings
and a smaller decline in sales.
   Income for the quarter ending March 31 was $199 million, or 61
cents per hare, compared to $212 million, or 65 cents per share, in
the first quarter of 1989. Sales fell 2 percent to $4.1 percent
from $4.2 billion a year earlier.
   Whitmore said the company is working to improve the quality of
traditional film products, while pursuing hybrid technologies that
combine film and electronic photography.
   He said Kodak soon plans to test market a kind of video telegram
that will allow customers to send ``high resolution, color images
of the family anywhere in the world along with a specialized
message to Grandma and Grandpa in a matter of seconds.''
   William F. Fowble, vice president of photographic products, told
shareholders that Kodak expects revenue from Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union to increase by more than 20 percent annually.
   He said the company has a successful joint venture in Hungary,
and is negotiating joint ventures in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Despite Lack of News, Soybeans Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as a surge of buying
by professional funds boosted soybeans.
   ``The strength of soybeans was surprising in that no new
features presented themselves to the market,'' said Rich Feltes, an
analyst with Refco Inc.
   Feltes noted that export sales from the United States remain
weak, while Brazilian exports on a week-to-week basis are strong.
   ``I think we have a market that is looking at factors not
immediately apparent,'' he said.
   The strength of soybean futures spilled over into the corn
market, which also received a boost from continued strong export
business. Feltes said the strength shown by the livestock market
also provided a boost to corn prices.
   Wheat futures were relatively weak, with trading light in
anticipation of the release Thursday of the U.S Ariculture
Department crop report estimating the winter wheat crop.
   Feltes said the failure of a bid by the Soviet Union to purchase
550,000 metric tons of wheat under an export bonus program had
little effect on wheat prices. He said traders expect the sale to
be approved eventually.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with the
contract for May delivery at $3.81 a bushel; corn was } cent to 3}
cents higher with May at $2.90 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2{
cents lower with May at $1.65 a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to
13} cents higher with May at $6.46{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Fastest Growing Segment of Retail Market a $25 Billion Industry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members-only warehouse clubs, introduced more
than a decade ago to allow buyers to purchase office, food and
household goods in bulk, have emerged as the retail industry's
fastest growing sector.
   Sales at the estimated 600 clubs nationwide, which target small
businesses, churches and non-profit groups with the lure of
wholesale purchases previously available only to large companies,
are projected to reach $25 billion this year, a ten-fold increase
over 1984.
   ``It took about five years for people to realize the concept was
viable,'' said Arthur Markowitz, senior editor of the trade
publication Discount Store News, which has monitored the growth of
clubs. ``It's a discount store for businessmen.''
   For an annual fee of about $25, club members are offered goods
ranging from peanut butter to fax machines, in large buildings that
look more like construction warehouses than retail outlets.
   The draw of the no-frills clubs, industry officials say, is that
small businesses can save by buying goods at near wholesale prices.
For that reason, the glitter of regular department store chains is
unneeded and unwanted.
   ``Our member is a very intelligent consumer,'' said John F.
Geisse, founder and chief executive of Indianapolis-based Wholesale
Club, which operates 24 warehouses in the Midwest. ``You'd better
have the right item at the right time, the best price and make sure
it's presented properly.''
   Finding the right way to present the clubs to the target
consumer was a matter of fine-tuning, particularly in the Midwest
where Geisse was working.
   ``It was rather rough in the early years,'' he said. ``We opened
West Allis (in suburban Milwaukee) and had a fabulous grand
opening, but people didn't come back. I don't think we did our
homework well. This was only our third unit.''
   That was in 1984 when industry sales nationwide were about $2.4
billion for 79 warehouses, according to Discount Store News. Geisse
said defining the products for small businesses was the key to
overcoming three profitless years and opening 21 new warehouses
since 1984.
   Discount Store News estimates the warehouse clubs are the
fastest growing sector of the retail industry with annual sales
increases ranging from 140 percent to 26 percent over the last five
years. Sales advances in other areas of retailing have been much
more modest.
   Stephen Mandel, a securities analyst with New York-based
investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co., agreed with the warehouse
clubs' emerging prominence in the retail industry. He said small
business owners, churches and non-profit organizations attacted by
prices typically 9 percent over manufacturer's cost are fueling the
growth.
   What makes the warehouse clubs stand out even more is the
trouble that other parts of the retail business have been facing
recently because of large debts, rapid expansion and overly
optimistic forecasts of aggressive spending by consumers, who now
seem to be holding back because of economic uncertainty.
   Some of the swankest department stores, such as Bloomingdale's
and Jordan Marsh, now operate under bankruptcy-court protection
because of parent company financial crises. Even a few big
discounters have sought bankruptcy refuge, most notably the Ames
Department Stores Inc. chain last month.
   Unlike discount stores, which offer about 50,000 items,
warehouse clubs sell only about 4,000 items specific to small
business needs at near wholesale prices, Markowitz said.
   Also unlike other retailers that operate on profit margins of
more than 20 percent, membership warehouse clubs operate on a 10
percent profit margin because they offer a limited assortment of
fast turning items, Markowitz said.
   The clubs carry staple items and basic office supplies like
sugar and copier paper on a regular basis, but beyond that, members
don't know what they might find on any given visit.
   ``The whole concept of buying is different,'' said Cathy Roper,
community relations manager for the PACE warehouse chain based in
Aurora, Colo. ``We're able to negotiate some bulk-type deals with
our vendors unlike a retailer that will get the same items again
and again.''
   The clubs combine wholesale and retail by buying items for
business use in bulk and carrying a few fast-turning consumer items
for their customers' personal use, like dress shirts and
electronics, Markowitz said.
   If an item moves slowly, the club won't carry it again, he said.
   ``That's the only thing that matters to them _ if it sells,'' he
said. ``Since they're not locked into anything, they can go into
wherever they can sell merchandise.''
   The clubs also keep costs low by avoiding members whose checks
might not always clear and by refusing to accept credit cards. ``If
there's a margin of only 10 percent, they can't afford to pay two
or three percent of that to Visa or Mastercard,'' Markowitz said.
   The clubs were introduced in the United States in 1976 when the
Price Co. opened its first Price Club in San Diego. The company now
has 48 warehouses nationwide, said Giles Bateman, vice chairman.
   Price Co.'s founder, Sol Price, got the idea for the warehouses
from huge ``cash-and-carry'' stores popular in Europe, Markowitz
said.
   The Price Club began expanding rapidly after the first unit, but
other companies didn't seize the market for several years,
Markowitz said.
   PACE entered the industry in 1982 and now has 54 stores in 15
states, Ms. Roper said, adding the company's expansion has not
slowed.
   Discount Store News projects continued growth for the entire
industry. Markowitz said states in the Northeast hold extraordinary
potential.
   ``In California, in the Los Angeles market, you have about 30
stores,'' he said. But in the 10-12-state Northeast region, ``in
the entire market, they only have about 30 stores. There's still a
lot of growth because there's still a lot of areas where there
aren't many of them.''

<HEAD>Ten-Year Notes at Year's Peak Yield</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes rose in
Wednesday's auction to the highest level in a year as the
government's record $30.5 billion cleared its second hurdle.
   The average yield was 8.88 percent, up from 8.59 percent at the
last auction on Feb. 7.
   It was the highest rate since 10-year notes averaged 9.18
percent on May 10, 1989. The notes will carry a coupon interest
rate of 8~ percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for
$9,996.70.
   A total of $10 billion in notes was sold out of bids totaling
$30 billion.
   The refunding winds up on Thursday with the auction of $10
billion in 30-year bonds.
   It began Tuesday with the sale of $10.57 billion in three-year
notes with an average yield of 8.74 percent, up from 8.43 percent
at the last three-year auction on Feb. 6 and the highest since such
notes averaged 9.12 percent last May 9. Bids totaled $37.3 billion.
   This quarter's refunding is $500 million larger than the last
two.
   In announcing this week's auctions, Treasury Undersecretary
Robert Glauber said $18.1 billion would be used to refund privately
held notes maturing on May 15 and about $12.4 billion would be
added to cash.
   Part of the new funds will be used to finance the savings and
loan bailout.
   The notes and bonds are sold regularly during the large debt
auctions held four times a year to replenish the government's
coffers.
   The Treasury sold $8.4 billion in three-month bills and $8.4
billion in six-month bills at its weekly bill auction on Monday.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua has resumed exports to the
United States following former President Reagan's 1985 trade
embargo, sending a shipload of sugar from the port of Corinto.
   Reagan imposed the embargo as a measure against the Marxist
Sandinista government. President Bush lifted it after
American-backed Violetta Chamorro de Barrios won the presidency in
February elections.
   Nicaragua shipped 18,000 metric tons of sugar on Tuesday, part
of the 54,328 metric tons Nicaragua can sell to the United States
this year at a preferred price above the world market.
   During the embargo Nicaragua sold most of its sugar, a major
export crop, to Soviet bloc nations.
   Despite tense diplomatic relations, the United States remained
the biggest buyer of Nicaraguan goods until the embargo was imposed.
   The U.S. embassy, which announced the shipment, said the Bush
administration is considering ``a series of steps to reduce
barriers and tariffs and open the market to Nicaraguan exports.''
   Other exports include cotton, tobacco, beef and seafood.
   Mrs. Chamorro took over a virtually bankrupt country and is
awaiting congressional approval of $300 million in emergency
economic aid.

<HEAD>Creditors Seek Involuntary Bankruptcy for Drexel Subsidiary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.
creditors asked a federal judge Wednesday to place a commodities
trading subsidiary into bankruptcy court because it is not paying
more than $500 million in debts.
   The move by several large foreign central banks and other
creditors would toss Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Corp.into
involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings, removing the company
from control of its parent.
   Drexel said in a statement it would not challenge the petition
but would exercise the right to convert it to a Chapter 11 case,
which allows a company to reorganize its assets and business under
protection from creditors.
   The petition was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan,
where the parent of the Wall Street firm sought protection from
creditors on Feb. 13 after a cash crunch and continued problems
from its 1989 securities fraud guilty plea.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the brokerage subsidiary, is
liquidating its assets outside of bankruptcy court. Creditors were
said to be considering whether to place the firm in involuntary
liquidation, where its actions would be controlled by the court.
   The bankruptcy petition filing by the commodities subsidiary was
made by creditors Banco de Portugal, the National Bank of
Yugoslavia, Nissho Iwai Corp., a Japanese trading concern, and
Ultramar Energy Ltd., an oil trading company in Tarrytown, a New
York suburb.
   The commodities subsidiary owes those and several dozen other
creditors between $500 million and $550 million, said Barry
Dichter, an attorney for Banco de Portugal.
   DBL Trading's largest asset is a $645 million claim against the
parent company for money that was funneled to the parent before it
filed for Chapter 11 protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
Dichter said.
   Drexel said the commodities trading subsidiary has estimated net
liabilities of $505 million, while its claim against the parent
company is about $558 million.
   ``DBL Trading indicated that the amounts recoverable from Group
represent the balance of loans and advances made to DBL Group in
line with similar transactions dating back over a number of
years,'' the statement said.
   The commodities subsidiary, based in Fort Lee, N.J., traded in
oil, precious metals and foreign exchange. It has ceased
operations. Attorneys said it had resolved its trading positions
except for several involving the future delivery of gold from
foreign mining companies.
   ``The creditors believe that their future is tied to exercising
control over the matter,'' Dichter said. ``Basically it was a
rudderless ship on which we were all passengers and we wanted to
steer the vessel.''
   He said DBL Trading's employees, including senior officers, had
left the subsidiary and the parent company was controlling its
destiny, which he called ``much like having the fox to guard the
chicken coop.''
   ``We had no confidence the claim would be actively pursued for
the benefit of Trading's creditors,'' Dichter said. ``We feared the
claim would be dealt with for Group's benefit.''
   The hundreds of millions of dollars owed by Drexel to the
subsidiary involves precious metals such as gold and platinum that
were leased from central banks of various governments, a common
trading practice.
   The metals then were used in other transactions that generated
cash for the commodities trading subsidiary. That money then was
``upstreamed'' into the parent company, which was short on cash.
   Under the filing, Dichter said, the subsidiary's creditors would
retain an independent consultant to examine the relationship
between the subsidiary and parent and make recommendations on how
it should resolve its liabilities.
   Drexel still would control the company with oversight by
creditors and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III. In a
Chapter 7 case, a trustee is appointed who must collect and
liquidate all property of the debtor's estate and investigate any
claims made by creditors.
   Lawyers said Nissho Iwai is owed about $160 million, Portugal's
central bank $95 million to $120 million, Yugoslavia's central bank
about $70 million and Ultramar Energy $11 million.

<HEAD>Supply Concerns Lift Crude, Gasoline Prices Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil and gasoline prices rallied Wednesday
as several news developments raised the possibility that supplies
of both fuels could be tighter in the near future.
   The June contract for delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 71 cents a 42-gallon barrel,
closing at $18.99 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The market moved higher on reports that Saudi Arabia was
exploring ways of cutting its oil production, said Andrew Lebow, an
analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   The prospect of reduced output by the largest member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised hopes that the
glut of oil on world markets _ which has depressed the price of
crude this year _ might abate.
   A job action by oil workers and a gas leak in the North Sea
raised further concerns about the near-term supply of crude, Lebow
said.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for June delivery advanced 1.49 cents
a gallon to 63.97 cents on the Nymex.
   Supply concerns also dominated trading in gasoline as a pipeline
in the Gulf of Mexico remained shut, analysts said.
   The pipeline, which serves 36 six drilling platforms and handles
95,000 barrels a day, might cause supply disruptions to refineries
just as they are preparing to process large-09 0025

   The stock market drifted through a mixed session
Wednesday, pausing after more than a week of steady gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 93.83 points over
the past seven sessions, slipped 0.68 to 2,732.88.
   Advancing issues just barely nosed out declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 760 up, 733
down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.22 million
shares, against 144.23 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 183.60 million shares.
   Interest rates moved higher in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds dropped about $5 for each $1,000 in face
value, increasing their yields to the 8.86 percent-8.90 percent
range.
   Analysts said both the stock and bond markets seemed to be on
hold while investors watched the progress of the Treasury's
quarterly auction of bonds and notes.
   A warm reception was reported Tuesday for the first of the
offering's three installments, a $10.5 billion sale of three-year
notes.
   The financing continued Wednesday with the sale of $10 billion
in 10-year notes, which went for an average yield of 8.88 percent
in what analysts described as positive results. It winds up with
$10 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Bristol Myers-Squibb rose { to
58{; International Business Machines gained { to 111\; Philip
Morris was unchanged at 43}, and Westinghouse Electric was down 1{
at 74.
   Sotheby's Holdings fell 3&lsqb; to 16{. A Tuesday night sale of
contemporary art at the auction firm brought results that were
reported to be sharply below expectations.
   Gold and silver mining stocks were broadly higher, aided by
signs of a rebound in the recently depressed precious-metals
markets. Gold for this month's delivery rose $1.90 to $371.90 an
ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   ASA Ltd. rose 1} to 49}; Homestake Mining 1 to 18; Newmont Gold
2\ to 42}; Battle Mountain Gold } to 13\, and Hecla Mining | to 12{.
   Utility issues extended their recent rally amid hopes that
interest rates might have topped out. Dow Jones's average of 15
utility stocks rose 1.69 to 213.78.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $7.03 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .38 to 187.49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .86 to 398.88, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .85 at 342.86.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<HEAD>Greyhound Cuts Fares In Half For Weekday Travel Next Two Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc., the target of a lengthy,
often-violent strike, said Wednesday it was cutting its weekday
fares in half for two weeks beginning May 14 in an effort to lure
back riders.
   ``This is a business that is based on trial, and then high
repeat usage,'' said Ralph Borland, Greyhound marketing vice
president. ``We want to induce them to ride and to see that the bus
line is unencumbered.''
   While the promotion could mean less cash in the short term,
``We're in this for the long term,'' Borland said.
   Greyhound bus drivers walked out March 2 in a dispute over wages
and job security, but the company immediately began replacing them
with new drivers and crossovers. The strike has been marked by
violence, with buses in a number of locations hit by gunfire.
   Greyhound Chairman Fred G. Currey said Monday that the company,
which operates the only nationwide bus system, now has enough
drivers to run at or near pre-strike levels.
   Currey said Greyhound is serving markets which provided 98
percent of its revenue last year, although ridership and revenue
hovered around 70 percent of year-ago levels _ not quite enough to
meet expenses.
   Greyhound is offering half-price tickets for travel Monday
through Thursday in the two weeks beginning May 14. The company
also is offering Mother's Day fares of $1 for travel of up to 500
miles on Sunday to mothers 18 or older.
   Borland said he had no projections of the fare cut's impact on
ridership.
   Analysts have expressed doubts Greyhound has enough cash to
operate for the long term, but company spokesman George Gravley
said, ``We have the capacity here to run things in a reasonable
way.''
   The strike has cost Greyhound more than it anticipated and
helped give the company $55.8 million in first quarter losses. In a
move to preserve operating funds, Greyhound last week said it would
not make a $9.75 million interest payment due Tuesday and had not
made about $5 million in lease payments due in April.
   Although the missed payments open the door for creditors to take
action to force the company into bankruptcy, Currey says he
believes they will give him time to rebuild the company.
   Reclaiming passengers is a key to that recovery.
   ``The typical Greyhound passenger rides several times a year,''
Gravley said. ``If they take one trip, they generally take a lot of
trips. Our job is to get them to take that first trip, and then
treat 'em right.''

<HEAD>Tight Supplies Boost Energy Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices surged Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid concerns that gasoline and crude oil
inventories would be tight in the near term.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans were mostly higher,
precious metals futures gained slightly; copper prices advanced and
livestock and pork prices gained.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 71 cents
higher with the contract for June delivery at $18.99 a barrel;
heating oil was 11 cents lower to 6 cents higher with June at 51.34
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.20 cent to 1.49 cents
higher with June at 63.97 cents a gallon.
   Gasoline futures advanced on good cash buying on the Gulf Coast,
said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   Prices also were boosted by American Petroleum Institute figures
that showed a drawdown of nearly 1 million barrels of unleaded
gasoline. The figures indicated the drop of gasoline stocks had a
particularly large impact on the Gulf Coast region, where prices
are higher than those on the mercantile exchange.
   The institute also reported a drop in gasoline output by U.S.
refineries. Samuels attributed the decline to maintenance work at
the refineries.
   Crude oil futures also rose on supply concerns, as labor
problems and a gas leak in the North Sea raised the possibility of
reduced output there, and as Saudi Arabia was reportedly seeking
ways to curb its production.
   Fears of tight supplies and high open interest in contracts
about to expire sent copper futures soaring on New York's Commodity
Exchange.
   Adding to the surge was increased labor tension in Peru and New
Guinea.
   In Peru, where a labor dispute at the Southern Peru Copper Corp.
was recently settled, workers at the Centromin mines are
threatening to strike as are workers at the Oktedi mines in New
Guinea.
   Meanwhile, labor talks were under way at several North American
copper mines.
   Copper was 4 cents to 5.35 cents higher with May at $1.244 a
pound.
   Precious metals futures were higher on the Comex as the value of
the dollar fell in relation to foreign currencies.
   Gold had difficulty getting on the plus side in early trading on
rumors the Soviet Union sold bullion to cover costs of recent grain
purchases, said Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
   But the decline in the dollar was too strong for the precious
metals market to ignore, he said.
   Gold was $1.70 to $1.90 higher with May at $371.90 a troy ounce;
silver was 3.4 cents to 3.9 cents higher with May at $5.028 a troy
ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade as a surge of buying by professional funds boosted
soybeans.
   ``The strength of soybeans was surprising in that no new
features presented themselves to the market,'' said Rich Feltes, an
analyst with Refco Inc.
   Feltes noted that export sales from the United States remained
weak, while Brazilian exports on a week-to-week basis were strong.
   The strength of soybean futures spilled over into the corn
market, which also received a boost from continued strong export
business. Feltes said the strength shown by the livestock market
also provided a boost to corn prices.
   Wheat futures were relatively weak, with trading light in
anticipation of the release Thursday of the U.S Ariculture
Department crop report estimating the size winter wheat crop.
   Wheat was { cent lower to 2 cents higher with May at $3.79{ a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3} cents higher with May at $2.90 a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with May at $1.65 a
bushel; soybeans were 13 cents to 14 cents higher with May at
$6.46} a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were supported by firmness in the cash
market and the perception that Tuesday's selloff was overdone.
   Live hogs were boosted by higher pork product prices, but pork
bellies were hurt by the belief that futures were overbought.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .83 cent higher with June at 74.75
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .58 cent higher
with May at 84.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent to .85
cent higher with June at 64.42 a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.45 cent lower to 1.38 cents higher with May at 67.95 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Ad Agency Offers Guarantees on its Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what is believed to be the first broad offer
of its kind, one of the nation's biggest advertising agencies said
Wednesday it would give clients a chance to get a guarantee on its
work.
   Executives from DDB Needham Worldwide said the guarantee means
the agency would get bonuses for work that produces results that
exceed expectations and make rebates for ads that fall short.
   The precise terms would vary from account to account, but agency
executives said the performance plan could increase or decrease an
advertiser's bill by as much as 30 percent.
   The plan comes as advertisers are questioning the value of
paying the standard rate that has prevailed in the ad business for
decades without regard to performance.
   An ad agency traditionally gets a 15-percent cut of what an
advertiser spends on print space or commercial air time.
   ``There is a lot of pressure from clients for agencies to go on
the line and be accountable for what their advertising does for the
client's business,'' said Arthur Anderson, a principal in Morgan
Anderson &amp; Co., an adviser to advertisers.
   William Weilbacher, an advertising consultant, said his latest
survey for the Association of National Advertisers indicated only
about a third of companies contacted last year said they pay the
standard 15 percent rate for advertising, down from about 50
percent in a 1983 survey.
   The proposal also comes as marketers are spending a greater
portion of their budgets on activities such as package design,
sales promotion and direct mailing rather than on conventional
advertising, to the dismay of ad agencies who are paid on the basis
of what is spent for media placements.
   DDB Needham was the 10th largest advertising agency based on
worldwide billings with nearly $4.1 billion in 1989, according to
the trade journal Advertising Age.
   It produces ads for Volkswagen and Audi cars, Michelob beer,
Clairol hair products, Ralston Purina pet foods, Michelin tires and
Ore-Ida potatoes.
   Keith L. Reinhard, chairman and chief executive, told a group of
media representatives that the agency has been working on the
program for more than three years.
   He said it should inspire ``new heights of original thought and
surprising execution'' because the goals are clearer and workers
will have new incentives.
   The plan works like this:
   The agency and the advertiser decide on precise objectives, such
as increasing the number of customers coming into stores by a
certain percentage or increasing consumer awareness of a brand.
   The client agrees to spend a certain amount on behalf of the
brand, to integrate all of the brand's marketing efforts with the
main advertising message and to maintian the quality, price and
distribution of the product.
   At the end of an agreed timeframe, the results would be tallied
and the agency would either have to pay a rebate if results came up
short or would get a bonus if the results meet or exceed the target.
   The agency would share two-thirds of any bonus with employees
who produced the improved results.
   Reinhard said the program has been tested with different
clients, who he declined to identify, and would be made available
first to the agency's U.S. and Canadian clients. He said two have
already said they plan to use the program. The agency has 65 major
national advertisers.
   ``We feel confident that we have both the tools and the talent
in hand to support this kind of guarantee,'' he said.
   Several DDB Needham clients such as Ralston Purina Corp.,
Anheuser-Busch Inc. and Volkswagen-Audi were asked for their
reactions to the proposal but declined to comment.
   Industry analysts were divided on the potential impact of the
plan for the industry in general.
   They said many agencies are already working for some clients
under compensation plans that give them bonuses for good work.
   Leslie Winthrop, the domestic president of The Advertising
Agency Register, which matches advertisers and agencies, said it
was ``a very courageous thing to do'' for DDB Needham to make the
plan available to all clients.
   She said other agencies would probably ``sit back and wait to
see how it will work.''
   But Weilbacher said DDB Needham's plan is a threat to other
agencies. ``I don't see how an agency cannot respond to this
gauntlet that has been thrown down,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops as Fear of Softer U.S. Economy Grows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply Wednesday against most
other major currencies as the foreign exchange market grew
increasingly concerned about indications that the U.S. economy is
softening.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders and currency analysts said the strength of the West
German mark and the Swiss franc accounted for much of the dollar's
losses, although the dollar also fell sharply against the Japanese
yen.
   The dollar traded at 1.4020 Swiss francs late Wednesday in New
York, down sharply from 1.4310 francs late Tuesday. In London, the
dollar fell to 1.4039 Swiss francs from 1.4332 late Tuesday.
   The Swiss franc is being viewed as a safe haven for investors
because many other major currencies appear troubled by domestic
concerns, said Brian Guidera, a currency trader for Swiss Bank
Corp. in New York.
   ``It's being seen to be the only logical alternative to the
uncertainty elsewhere in the world,'' he said. ``As far as
high-yielding currencies go, it's seen as stable.''
   Traders also said the Swiss franc is boosted by that nation's
relatively high interest rates.
   The dollar was viewed as the currency of choice until Friday,
when government figures showed employment growth in April was far
lower than economists expected, traders said. That report altered
the belief that the U.S. economy was expanding and that higher
interest rates would result.
   Higher domestic interest rates increase the relative
attractiveness of returns on a nation's currency.
   The West German mark also showed renewed strength Wednesday. The
dollar was trading at 1.6365 marks in New York late in the day,
down from 1.6575 marks late Tuesday. The dollar fell in London to
1.6375 marks from 1.6580 marks late Tuesday.
   William Harrington, an international economist with the Wefa
Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the mark has benefited from the
recent belief that the union of the currencies of West and East
Germany will go more smoothly than originally forecast.
   The dollar also fell sharply against the Japanese yen.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 157.03 yen, down 1.02 yen from
Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted lower at
156.40 yen, and in New York the dollar fell to 156.50 yen in late
trading from 157.63 yen late Tuesday.
   The British pound rose to $1.6785 in London from $1.6697 late
Tuesday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.6785, up from $1.6705
late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday
levels included: 1.1660 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1639; 5.5100
French francs, up from 5.5685; and 1,203.25 Italian lire, up from
1,216.00.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,

<HEAD>Bond Prices Finish Lower; 10-Year Note Auction Rated Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell Wednesday despite the
completion of another well-received round in the Treasury's
three-part quarterly refunding auction.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond finished down 13-32 point,
or $4 per $1,000 face amount, while its yield, which rises when
prices fall, rose to 8.86 percent from 8.82 percent late Tuesday.
   Prices moved generally lower in advance of the announcement of
the results of the Treasury's auction of $10 billion in 10-year
notes.
   Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said prices were depressed by weakness in the dollar
and worries that demand for the 10-year notes was weak.
   But the auction results, announced late in the session, turned
out better than expected as investors grabbed the 10-year notes at
yields of 8.88 percent, the highest level since a similar auction
averaged 9.18 percent May 10, 1989.
   Flanagan said $30 billion in bids were received for the $10
billion in notes, reflecting exceptionally strong demand for the
issues.
   That also was reflected in the amount of non-competitive bids,
which amounted to $659 million and the highest level since August
1985. Non-competitive bids often are submitted by individuals or
small accounts who are content to buy securities at whatever the
average yield turns out to be.
   The refunding auctions began Tuesday with the sale of $10.57
billion in three-year notes with an average yield of 8.74 percent,
the highest since such notes averaged 9.12 percent last May 9.
   Market watchers say the strong demand for three-year and 10-year
notes may not necessarily spill over into Thursday's scheduled
auction of $10 billion in 30-year bonds. That sale will complete
the refunding auction.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell by 1-16 point, intermediate maturities fell &lsqb;
point to 7-32 point, and long-term issues lost as much as 7-16
point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.98 to 1,138.66.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 1-32 point to 89 29-32. The average
yield to maturity was unchanged at 7.65 percent, the same as late
Tuesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.99 percent as the
discount lost 4 basis points to 7.74 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.18 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to
7.76 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.36 percent as the
discount lost 1 basis point to 7.77 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, unchanged
from late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   USX Corp. has fetched $2.5 million in an
auction of 15 works of art, in a sale that art analysts say runs
counter to a corporate trend of buying expensive art.
   The steel and energy giant has decided to sell a total of 64
works from its 100-piece collection because they can ``fetch a
price,'' said USX spokesman Bill Keslar.
   Buyers this week snatched up the 15 contemporary pieces for
$750,000 more than the pre-auction estimate.
   ``The market is strong for art work,'' Keslar said. ``This was a
privately held collection, and it is like any other asset of a
corporation.''
   A Morris Louis contemporary painting, ``Beta Zeta,'' and a Frank
Stella painting ``Concentric Squares'' each sold for $462,000,
about $100,000 more than their pre-auction estimates.
   Joan Mitchell's ``Belle Bete,'' which sold for $385,000, was
estimated to be worth up to $250,000. Jules Olitski's ``Strips
Heresy'' sold for $352,000, more than double its estimated value.
   Most of the buyers were European, Asian and American collectors,
said Jay Cantor, director of museum and corporate services at
Christie's.
   Impressionist and modern works will be auctioned May 15-16, and
American selections will be sold May 22-23 at Christie's in New
York. A selection of European post-war abstract art will be sold at
Christie's in London on June 28.
   Most companies that buy fine art do so to enhance the working
environment, said Cantor.
   ``No company has embarked on an art program primarily as an
investment,'' said Beatrix Medinger, manager principle of VIART
Corp. in New York, which helps companies create collections. ``In
the last 10 years, there's been an astronomical increase in the
number of corporations who have worked at putting art collections
together.''
   Chase Manhattan Corp. started the trend in 1959. The bank's
13,000-piece collection is spread among 350 locations worldwide,
said Margaret della Cioppa, manager of Chase Manhattan's art
program.
   The bank has several pieces from famous artists, including a
Picasso painting. None of the collection has been sold, Ms. della
Cioppa said.
   ``They (companies) don't think of it as an investment,'' she
said. ``I think it's more to do with their image than buying and
selling. ...If it were to be considered an investment, it would be
a good investment because the art market is up.''
   Some companies have opened their collections to the public, but
others keep them behind closed doors.
   At USX, some museums offered to exhibit the company's collection
but executives turned them down, said Leon Arkus, former director
of The Carnegie Museum of Art.
   Arkus led the committee that selected the USX collection more
than 20 years ago.
   ``It's got to do with the attitude of a corporation who sees
only dollar signs and doesn't see beneath it all,'' Arkus said.
``Why USX kept that collection secret, heaven knows.''
   Keslar, however, said the company is not under any obligation to
keep the collection in its headquarters city. Also, USX wouldn't
have received tax breaks by donating the collection, Keslar said.
   The profits from the sale will be returned to the company's
general funds, he said.
   Corporate art collecting is extremely popular, but the incentive
to donate works to non-profit institutions diminished in 1986 when
U.S. lawmakers removed tax breaks, Cantor said.

<HEAD>Retailers Get More Time to File Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 2 grafs on judge ruling against landlord of flagship
Bloomie's store</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. on Wednesday obtained a four-month extension in which
to file their plan to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Lawyers for the retailing units of Campeau Corp. told U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. they might need even longer
than the newly approved deadline of Sept. 12 because the case is so
complex.
   Federated and Allied have more than 200,000 creditors, about
100,000 employees and operate 260 stores in 28 states.
   The judge also approved a settlement Federated negotiated with
the Internal Revenue Service in a dispute over how taxes on
inventory movement and size in 1981-83.
   Under the agreement, Federated will receive a $23 million refund
from the IRS, but will adopt IRS tax computing methods over a
10-year period _ starting with the 1983 tax year _ that could
increase Federated's taxes by $14 million during that time.
   Federated lawyer Rick Cieri said the settlement increases the
value of Federated for creditors, provides additional money for its
operations and saves the cost of continued litigation.
   Aug approved the settlement over the objection of New York-based
Citibank, which wanted to know whether Federated's parent company,
Federated Stores Inc., would claim any of the $23 million refund.
   Robert Seppelt, vice president of taxes for Federated Department
Stores, said FSI has no claim to the $23 million.
   None of the Federated or Allied creditors objected to the
extension Aug granted. Without it, Federated and Allied would have
had to file the plan by Sunday, four months after the companies
filed their Chapter 11 petitions Jan. 15.
   The petitions listed $7.7 billion in debts, most accumulated
when Toronto-based Campeau bought both companies in leveraged deals
in 1986 and 1988.
   In another matter Wednesday, Aug ruled against B. Bros. Realty
Limited Partnership, landlord of Bloomingdale's posh flagship store
in Manhattan. The partnership had claimed the lease for the store
which runs through 2006 had become invalid because it was
transferred from Federated to Bloomingdale's. The landlord wanted
the store vacated by May 17.
   But the judge angrily rejected the claim, determining that the
store was continuing to operate normally and paying the rent
promptly. He further ordered the landlord to pay Federated's
defense costs in the matter, accusing the partnership's owners of
``vexatious conduct and harassment.'' Carol Sanger, Federated
spokeswoman, said the defense costs hadn't been determined.

   Shareholders of American Brands Inc.,
which makes Carlton, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Tareyton and other
cigarettes, rejected a proposal to dump the company's tobacco
businesses.
   But the resolution, which asked the company to stop producing
and marketing tobacco by the year 2000, received enough votes to be
raised again at next year's meeting. Nearly 4 percent of
stockholders backed the resolution.
   In addition to making cigarettes, American Brands sells liquor,
life insurance, office products, golf supplies, hardware and
housewares.
   ``I'm encouraged. We'll submit it again next year,'' said Jeanne
Pinard, a Massachusetts teacher who introduced the proposal.
   American Brands Chairman William J. Alley told the meeting in
New York on Tuesday that tobacco products represent an important
segment of the company's business, and earnings have been a
significant source of revenues.
   ``Smoking is a matter of choice for each individual,'' he said,
answering a question.
   Alley refused to comment on tobacco-related health risks because
of pending litigation. He said the company is involved in 41 of the
67 pending cases against the tobacco industry.
   He criticized the government for trying to impose new
restrictions on the industry, such as bans on tobacco
advertisements.

<HEAD>FCC Chairman Says Control Possible If Bell's Make Equipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's top telephone regulator said
Wednesday he can safely control the huge regional Bell telephone
companies if they are allowed to design and manufacture telephone
equipment.
   But Bell rivals and consumer groups told a Senate hearing they
were concerned Bell companies could drive out competition and
subsidize new business ventures with their monopoly local telephone
earnings.
   A bill by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., would lift
manufacturing restrictions imposed on the seven regional Bell
companies by a court ruling that ended an American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. antitrust suit in 1984.
   The Hollings bill would allow the Bells to design, develop and
make telecommunications equipment, including network and customer
premises equipment.
   It also has provisions requiring that such activities take place
in the United States and assuring against cross-subsidies.
   The FCC's admitted inability to fully monitor the business
practices of AT&amp;T led to the federal consent decree in which AT&amp;T
in 1984 spun off the regional Bells.
   But FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes told the Senate Commerce, Science
and Transportation subcommittee on communications that the FCC,
with an increased budget and new price regulatory scheme, was
prepared to monitor Bell manufacturing activities.
   ``Existing, pending and proposed FCC and state regulatory
safeguards will be adequate to safeguard the interests of telephone
ratepayers and potential Bell company manufacturing competitors,''
Sikes said.
   Sikes said the FCC also is aided now by Bell competitors eager
to blow the whistle on any Bell missteps.
   But Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer
Federation of America, said lifting the manufacturing restrictions
could mean ``substantial local rate increases and diminished
competition in return for theoretical, vaguely articulated
benefits.''
   Albert Kramer, general counsel of the North American
Telecommunications Association, said his group of equipment
manufacturers and distributors opposes the bill because it would
not improve competitiveness.
   Hollings said he was not sure when he would try to advance the
bill. A similar version is pending in the House of Representatives.
   Previous efforts to free the Bells from restrictions have not
advanced in Congress. But the Bells have launched a
multimillion-dollar campaign this year to try to swing public and
congressional opinion to their side.

<HEAD>Mistrial in Wiper Patent Suit Against Ford; New Jury To Be Picked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY L. ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge declared a mistrial Wednesday
after a jury failed to agree on how much money to award an inventor
whose patent for an intermittent windshield wiper was violated by
Ford Motor Co.
   U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn's decision came after six days of
deliberations.
   The jury decided on Jan. 29 that Ford had infringed on the
patent held by Robert W. Kearns, but ruled Tuesday that the
infringement was not intentional, limiting the amount he could be
awarded.
   Tuesday's ruling meant Kearns only could be awarded compensatory
damages and not punitive damages, Court Executive John Mayer said.
   The jury of five women and three men was dismissed by the judge,
who will oversee a new damages trial with new jurors.
   ``We are disappointed the jury was unable to reach a verdict in
damages,'' Ford spokesman Tom Foote said. ``However, we are pleased
that the jury recognized that Ford didn't intentionally infringe
the Kearns patents.''
   Foote said Ford already has asked the judge to overrule the
jury's finding that Kearns' patents were valid. ``We expect the
court to hold a hearing on that motion in the near future,'' he
said.
   Kearns said the delay was a disappointment. ``They stole more
than my invention, they stole a business opportunity,'' he said.
``They stole what makes America great.''
   After the jury's January decision, Cohn issued an order
forbidding Kearns or Ford officials from talking about the case.
   Kearns, 62, of Gaithersburg, Md., claimed in his 12-year-old
suit that he installed a set of his intermittent wipers on a 1962
Ford and took it to the automaker. He said he believed Ford would
buy his invention since engineers questioned him at length about it.
   The former Wayne State University professor also is suing
General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and a
dozen other automakers and auto-related companies. The case against
Ford was the first to go to trial.

<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. boss Laurence A. Tisch conceded
Wednesday that the television network's prime-time ratings are a
disaster, but said there will be improvement with next fall's
schedule.
   During a raucous shareholder's meeting, the CBS president and
chief executive also called for regulators to free the three major
TV networks to share in the financial rewards from reruns of
programs sold in syndication.
   CBS, third in prime time ratings for three consecutive seasons,
had its worst prime-time record in the 30-week season that ended in
April. CBS averaged a 12.2 rating, a 4 percent drop from 1988-89.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 households and by some
estimates is worth $100 million in advertising revenue over a
year's time.
   Tisch has insisted for the past two years that he is intent on
having the network regain leadership in prime time.
   But some shareholders said during the 2{-hour meeting that they
saw little evidence of progress.
   One shareholder complained that members of the CBS board other
than CBS founder William Paley and former CBS news anchor Walter
Cronkite have no background in broadcasting. Another said CBS
programming puts her to sleep.
   Tisch said the board members are knowledgable and pointed out
that CBS is first in daytime and sports ratings, adding ``we are
not a total disaster.''
   The company committed itself over the past year to spend more
than $3.5 billion for the rights to broadcast the major league
baseball playoffs, professional football, the NCAA basketball
tournament and two Winter Olympics.
   The network hopes those high-profile events will help draw
viewers to its prime-time lineup.
   ``We are a total disaster only in prime time,'' Tisch said,
adding that he was confident that was being corrected.
   He said ``you will see progress in September'' with the new fall
schedule drawn up by Jeff Sagansky, new president of CBS
Entertainment. Sagansky was hired late last year to succeed Kim
LeMasters, who held the job for two seasons.
   Nonetheless, Tisch said CBS will suffer ``some effect'' from the
Federal Communications Commission's one-year waiver that allows Fox
Broadcasting Co. to offer its 129 affiliates up to 18{ hours of
programming a week.
   The waiver lets Fox expand beyond the 15 hours the FCC considers
the threshold for defining a network, a mantle Fox doesn't want to
wear.
   Had the waiver been refused, Fox would have had to scale back
its plans to expand programming this fall or withdraw from the
luucrative program syndication business from which CBS, NBC and ABC
now are barred by FCC rules.
   ``Unlike the television networks, the major studios and cable
companies freely participate in ownership of both programs and
delivery systems,'' Tisch said. He said foreign companies have also
benefited from these restrictions on the networks by buying
American studios.
   ``If the '90s are to be a decade of robust, healthy competition
among all industry forces, the handcuffs must come off the three
American broadcast networks,'' he said.

that would be triggered throughout federal programs if
deficit-reduction targets are not met next fall, said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The leadership in the House and the Senate ... has accepted
the president's invitation'' to a budget summit with no
preconditions, declared House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   Negotiators for the House, Senate and White House will meet for
the first time next Tuesday at the White House, said Fitzwater.
   Bush will chair the first session. After that, he ``will be
involved as necessary,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman blamed increasing interest rates, lower revenues
to the Treasury from a sluggish economy and a higher-than-expected
cost of the savings and loan bailout for the widening deficit gap.
   Internal administration estimates suggest that the government
will miss deficit-reduction targets next fall by up to $100
billion, Fitzwater said.
   ``While the numbers aren't clear, it does seem clear to the
legislative leaders as well as the administration that severe
action needs to be taken to reduce the deficit and keep the economy
on a sound track,'' he said in announcing the budget talks.
   Although a ``no new taxes'' pledge was a central part of Bush's
1988 campaign, deteriorating economic conditions now make massive
spending cuts likely next fall in the absence of major
deficit-cutting action, administration officials say.
   Neither White House officials nor congressional leaders would
predict whether tax increases might be included in an ultimate
compromise _ or what kind or size they might be if included.
   However, there seemed a growing feeling on all sides that
deficit reductions of the magnitude now being discussed could not
be achieved through budget cuts alone.
   No timetables or deadlines were set, but House Minority Leader
Bob Michel, R-Ill., said he hoped for ``some real significant
progress'' before Congress' Fourth of July recess.
   ``No decisions have been made other than to begin discussions
next week on what we hope will be a good faith effort to deal with
a very serious national problem,'' Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said.
   Seriousness was more evident than optimism.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said in a Senate
speech, ``I think we're prepared to succeed, but we may not
succeed.'' He said coming up with a long-elusive bipartisan budget
agreement was ``like putting Humpty-Dumpty together again.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the chairman of the tax-drafting
House Ways and Means Committee, pointed to political differences
among the negotiators and said, ``I don't think we're going to be
able to come up with anything out of this group.''
   The budget summit _ proposed by Bush earlier in the week _ was
annunced after top congressional leaders met with the president for
about an hour.
   Foley named House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., an
outspoken critic of Bush administration policies, as leader of the
House negotiating team.
   ``I expect that we're going to proceed in good faith with these
discussions and we're not going to attempt to politicize them on
either side,'' Foley said.
   Some Democrats have voiced concerns that the administration may
be trying to trap them into advocating election-year tax increases,
but Foley said: ``I trust the White House until I have reason not
to. And I have no reason not to.''
   Foley said other House Democratic negotiators are Rep. William
H. Gray III, D-Pa., the assistant majority leader, as well as Reps.
Rostenkowski of Illinois, Jamie Whitten of Mississippi and Leon
Panetta of California, the Democratic chairmen of the Ways and
Means, Appropriations and Budget committees, respectively.
   Michel of Illinois named Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the assistant
minority leader, and the ranking Republicans on those same three
tax-writing and finance committees, Bill Archer of Texas, Silvio O.
Conte of Massachusetts, and Bill Frenzel of Minnesota.
   Mitchell said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., would be his personal
representative to the talks, along with Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and James Sasser, D-Tenn., the chairmen of
Appropriations, Finance and Budget respectively.
   Senate Minority Leader Dole named Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, as
his representative, with Sens. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., and Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., also of
Appropriations, Finance and Budget.
   The White House announced that, in addition to Bush, who will
sit in on the talks from time to time, its negotiators would be
Budget Director Richard Darman, Chief of Staff John Sununu and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Fitzwater said repeated use of the ``no preconditions'' term
``indicates and symbolizes an attitude and a spirit of achieving an
end result that is good government void of the normal political
posturing, politics and perceptions.''
   The administration hopes any compromise would cover several
years, address some of the president's proposals for overhauling
the congressional budget process and not undermine economic growth.
   ``The wrong kind of tax measures could adversely effect economic
growth,'' said Budget Director Richard Darman.
   Despite repeated efforts by Congress and the administration to
reduce the deficit over the past decade, this year's shortfall may
rise to nearly $200 billion. The Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law
calls for a $100 billion deficit this year and for a $64 billion in
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.

<TEXT>
   The textbook publishing and insurance
concern Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said Wednesday it has
terminated discussions on selling some of its assets and public
debt.
   Former U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who has served for a decade on
HBJ's board, has previously said the company was holding talks with
The Thomson Corp., a Canadian company that owns newspapers, other
publishing interests and a travel business.
   Harcourt, which has been struggling under a huge debt incurred
in avoiding a takeover in 1987, acknowledged last month that it was
in talks but did not identify who it was talking to or what was
being discussed.
   Thomson offered no comment on the reports.
   On Wednesday, Harcourt said the talks had involved acquisition
of ``certain limited assets of HBJ by a third party and the
purchase of some or all of HBJ's existing public debt at a
discount'' from book value.
   HBJ incurred a $2 billion debt through a recapitalization that
it undertook as it resisted a hostile 1987 takeover bid by British
publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Last year, Harcourt sold its theme parks business for about $1.1
billion _ below what some analysts expected the company would get _
in an effort to reduce debt.
   But Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, lowered
the company's debt rating in February and said the company's cash
flow from publishing and insurance ``will provide only narrow
coverage'' of anticipated interest payments and capital expenses
coming due shortly.
   Within three years, Harcourt is to start paying hundreds of
millions of dollars more in annual dividends and interest to
bondholders.
   Moody's said those obligations will ``likely necessitate further
asset sales and-or debt restructuring.''

<HEAD>Cost Of Living Increased 11.4 Percent In April; Smallest Increase
In Five</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of living increased by
11.4 percent in April, sharply down from the previous month's 95.5
percent leap, the Economy Ministry announced.
   The April figure was the lowest monthly cost-of-living increase
since last November's 6.5 percent. It left inflation over the
previous 12 months at 16,903.2 percent, and 251.8 percent for the
year to date.
   Officials on Wednesday attributed the sharp April decline to a
severe anti-inflationary adjustment to economic policy put into
effect by the 10-month-old government of President Carlos Menem.
   Planning Secretary Moises Ikonicoff said the April decline
``confirmed a tendency toward stabilization initiated in the second
half of March'' and predicted the May inflation rate would be even
lower than April's.
   Carlos Carballo, undersecretary of economy, said the April
decline in inflation indicated that ``public finances are under
control.'' A return to hyperinflation experienced from December
through March ``is little short of impossible,'' he added.
   The cost of living rose 40.1 percent in December, 79.2 percent
in January, and 61.6 percent in February. The 12-month inflation
figure hit a high of 20,266 percent in March.
   In its recent policy adjustment, the government sharply reduced
the money supply, halting the practice of printing money to finance
deficit spending by public companies and other government entities.
   Earlier, Economy Minister Antonio Ernan Gonzalez removed
exchange controls, allowing the local currency to float against the
dollar, and sharply increased public utility rates and fuel prices.
   Menem, a 59-year-old lawyer and former provincial governor, has
pledged to spur economic growth by balancing the budget, selling
money-losing state companies, deregulating monopolies, ending
subsidies, lowering trade barriers, reforming the tax code and
eliminating corruption.
   Economic policy has been criticized by organized labor, which
charges that real wages have fallen 50 percent below the average
for the 1980s and claims that privatization will lead to loss of
jobs and benefits as well as national patrimony.

   Time Warner Inc.'s Entertainment Weekly magazine
said it has purchased the name and subscription file of 7 Days
magazine, the New York arts and entertainment weekly that folded
recently.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed Wednesday.
   Publisher Michael Klingensmith said 7 Days' 20,000 subscribers
would be offered the chance to receive Entertainment Weekly to
fulfill the remaining portion of the subscriptions. If they
decline, he said they would get refunds.
   In addition, Klingensmith said the 7 Days name and trademark
might be used in connection with regional or metropolitian editions
being considered for Entertainment Weekly.
   ``The 7 Days trademark is well established and we had tremendous
respect for the magazine editorially,'' he said. ``It's a name
which we feel has many possible applications for Entertainment
Weekly, both in the New York market and elsewhere.''
   Entertainment Weekly was launched in February and offers reviews
and stories on movies, music, television, books and home video.
   It has a circulation of 600,000 nationally.
   7 Days reported on the New York arts and entertainment scene for
two years before it was closed earlier this year because of
difficulties attracting advertising in what has been a very soft
market.

<TEXT>
   Arco Chemical said Wednesday it
would invest about $2.5 billion over the next five years to
increase capacity to make propylene oxide.
   ``Today, we are moving forward with our plans to add about 1
billion pounds of propylene oxide capacity by 1994, for a total of
4 billion pounds,'' Harold A. Sorgenti, president and chief
executive officer, said at the company's annual meeting.
   The expansion will include building a new plant in Channelview,
Texas, completing a joint venture in South Korea and expanding the
company's facility at Fos-sur-mer, France, he said.
   Propylene oxide is used in the manufacture of products including
seat cushions, pet foods, antifreeze and perfume.
   Since 1985, Arco Chemical has increased sales from $1.6 billion
to $2.7 billion, improved net income from $89 million to $405
million and expanded foreign operations, Sorgenti said.
   Foreign sales now account for 44 percent of revenues, he said.
   Sorgenti said Arco is sensitive to public concern about the
environment. He told stockholders the company had adopted 10
performance-based principles developed by the Chemical
Manufacturers Association and joined with other manufacturers to
form a national company to recycle polystyrene plastics.
   Arco intends to reduce air emissions at the company's plants by
85 percent, he said, and reduce other waste generated by nearly 40
percent from 1986 levels by the end of 1992.
   Sorgenti said the company expects continued strong growth in
demand for MTBE, an octane-enhancer for gasoline that also helps
reduce auto emissions.

   The government's prosecution of three commodity
traders is simply ``a case about fraud,'' a federal prosecutor said
Wednesday at the first trial resulting from an FBI probe at the
world's largest futures exchanges.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Pollack cautioned the jury in
opening remarks at the U.S. District Court trial not to be
distracted by the unfamiliar rules and intricate mechanics of
futures trading.
   ``These are not complicated crimes,'' Pollack said. ``These are
simple crimes that occurred in a complex setting.''
   ``Stripped to its barest essentials, the evidence will
demonstrate that this is a case about fraud,'' he said.
   Defendants Robert D. Mosky, Danny L. Scheck and David Zatz are
accused of defrauding public customers as they traded Swiss franc
futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   They are the first to go on trial of 47 traders and a clerk
indicted last year after an unprecedented FBI sting operation at
the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade _ the world's two largest
commodity futures exchanges.
   Defense lawyers were to make their opening statements Thursday
morning, followed by the first prosecution witness, an official of
the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC
regulates futures trading.
   Pollack began his opening statement after 12 jurors and five
alternates were chosen in a morning session before U.S. District
Judge Ann C. Williams.
   The three defendants were ``motivated by greed, pure and
simple,'' he said.
   ``A thief who plies his trade in the guise of a bright trading
jacket and uses a deck of customer orders is no less a thief than a
common cat burglar,'' the prosecutor said.
   Pollack devoted much of his statement to explaining the basics
of futures trading. Educating the jury could prove a daunting task
in the trial, expected to last about six weeks.
   The prosecutor also told jurors they would hear conversations
about illegal trading, secretly recorded by FBI agent Randall
Jannett, who posed as a corrupt trader.
   Among the recorded comments the jury will hear, Pollack said, is
a statement Mosky allegedly made to Jannett that ``good things
happen to those who help out.''
   Pollack said Mosky made the remark after Jannett agreed to a
trade that deprived a customer of ``a profit opportunity.''
   ``That phrase ... captures the essence of what this case is all
about,'' Pollack said. ``I'll help you, you help me, we'll each
make money at the expense of the unwitting customer.''
   Mosky faces charges of racketeering conspiracy, 28 counts of
mail or wire fraud and 51 counts of violating federal
futures-trading rules. If convicted on all counts, he could be
sentenced to 415 years in prison and fined $12.4 million.
   Zatz and Scheck are charged with more than a dozen counts each
of mail or wire fraud and trading violations. They face maxiumum
sentences of 70 years and 90 years in prison and fines of $2.1
million and $3 million, respectively.
   Sixteen of those indicted have pleaded guilty to reduced charges
in return for their cooperation.
   The government's case hinges on the testimony of two traders who
worked with the defendants and have pleaded guilty to fraud
charges, and on the observations and tape-recorded evidence
gathered by Jannett.
   A Swiss franc future is a contract to buy or sell a specified
amount of the currency at a future date at a price agreed upon in
advance.
   Banks and multinational businesses trade currency futures as
insurance against foreign exchange losses. Futures contracts also
are traded by speculators seeking to profit from the constantly
changing prices.

<HEAD>Film Producer Grimaldi Sues Pathe, Time Warner Over MGM-UA Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producer Alberto Grimaldi sued Time Warner
Inc., MGM-UA Communications Co. and Pathe Communications Corp.
Wednesday, claiming the three companies have entered into a
fraudulent movie distribution deal.
   The class-action suit, filed in New York Federal Court,
maintains that Pathe's acquisition of MGM-UA and Pathe's subsequent
distribution deal with Time Warner will deny Grimaldi fees
generated by his more 23 films in the MGM-UA library.
   Grimaldi is the producer of ``For a Few Dollars More,'' ``The
Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' and ``Last Tango in Paris,'' among
other films.
   He claims the deal would leave MGM-UA with insufficient funds to
compensate profit participants of the films in the studio's library.
   Pathe launched its $1.27 billion acquisition of MGM-UA in March.
In April, Pathe announced that Time Warner would provide $650
million to help finance the acquisition.
   In exchange, Time Warner, parent company of Warner Bros.,
received distribution rights to future and current Pathe and United
Artists films. Warner Bros. also is named as a defendant in the
suit.
   Grimaldi, an Italian citizen, believes Time Warner will receive
an excessive share _ up to 75 percent _ of the net receipts
generated by the exploitation of the MGM-UA library. In his suit,
he asks that Pathe's deal with Time Warner either be rescinded or
modified and asks for damages of not less than $50,000.
   Grimaldi said in an interview that he is hopeful other
filmmakers with films in the MGM-UA library will join him in the
suit. Grimaldi said he had asked Pathe to return his films to him
but the studio declined.
   ``I don't object to Pathe buying MGM-UA as long as MGM-UA
remains a healthy company,'' he said.
   The lawsuit alleges breach of contract, interference with
contractual relations, racketeering and violations of the Debtor
and Creditor Law.
   Theodore J. Cohen, Pathe's executive vice president and general
counsel, said, ``Pathe has the intention of creating a strong,
unified and viable company that will honor the obligations of all
its constituents. Time Warner's involvement will serve to
strengthen the enterprise.''
   A telephone call to Time Warner's offices in New York was not
answered and a phone message left with MGM-UA was not returned
immediately.

<HEAD>Attorney General Intervenes in Newspaper Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Florida moved Wednesday to join
the St. Petersburg Times in a legal battle over stock dividends
with a shareholder group led by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass.
   Attorney General Bob Butterworth filed a motion to intervene in
U.S. District Court in Tampa, saying he wanted to help fend off an
``attack by profiteers.''
   His action fulfilled a promise in March to join the Times in the
case.
   The Bass group, known as the Poynter-Jamison Ventures Limited
Partnership, filed suit in February against the Times Publishing
Co. and the Poynter Institute, a non-profit journalism school that
uses Times stock dividends to support its operations.
   The Bass group owns 40 percent of the company's voting stock but
receives only 5.7 percent of its dividends. The Poynter Institute
owns a majority of the voting stock and receives 83 percent of the
dividends by virtue of its control of most of the company's
preferred stock.
   The Bass group wants to change the stock structure to get a
better return on its investment. Times Publishing defends the stock
arrangement as beneficial to the journalistic standards of the
newspaper and the health of Poynter Institute.
   ``The relief sought by the Ventures partners would significantly
diminish the future resources of the Poynter Institute,''
Butterworth said.
   ``The Attorney General has determined that it is important to
Florida public policy to protect such arrangements from attack by
profiteers.''
   Also, Butterworth said, he wanted to send a message ``to
reassure those persons who desire to give money to charities that
their request and wishes will be honored by the state of Florida,
and that the state will not permit charitable bequests to be
usurped by outside speculators and interlopers.''
   The Bass group includes relatives of the late Nelson Poynter,
who founded the Institute and set up the unusual stock arrangement.

<HEAD>National Intergroup Says Earnings Up 26 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Intergroup Inc. said its fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings increased 26 percent, in part because of
the sale of aluminum assets.
   National Intergroup, which owns steel, drug-distribution and
retail interests, said Tuesday it earned $3.4 million, or 9 cents a
share, on sales of $752.8 million in the three months ending March
31. That was up from earnings of $2.7 million, or 6 cents a share,
on sales of $663.8 million in the year-earlier period.
   National Intergroup said it made $7.1 million in the latest
quarter from sales of aluminum assets, including the discontinued
National Aluminum interest.
   The company is in the process of selling its metals business to
concentrate on wholesale distribution, primarily of
pharmaceuticals. It agreed two weeks ago to sell a 40 percent stake
in National Steel Corp. to NKK Corp. of Japan for $294 million.
   In the fiscal year ending March 31, National Intergroup said it
earned $55.7 million, or $2.31 a share, compared with a loss of
$15.7 million, or 98 cents a share, in the preceding year. Sales
rose to $2.8 billion from $2.3 billion.
