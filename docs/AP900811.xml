   A man with AIDS bludgeoned to death his mother
who had come from California to care for him, and then set himself
on fire, police said.
   Earl Imbert, 39, was arrested Thursday and charged with second
degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.
   Joseph Imbert, a brother in California, told police Earl Imbert
has AIDS and a history of psychological problems.
   Imbert's mother, Leona Imbert, 63, was found wrapped in a
blanket on a bed in her son's apartment.
   She was apparently asleep when she was bludgeoned repeatedly on
the head with a clawhammer and a wooden statue, said police Sgt.
Alfred King.
   ``He just said he killed her and he wanted to kill himself,''
King said. ``He definitely incriminated himself. There was no rhyme
or reason.''
   It was not immediately known how long Mrs. Imbert had been dead.
   Investigators found airplane tickets for the Imberts, who were
scheduled to return to California on Friday. Mrs. Imbert had come
from Van Nuys, Calif., three to four months ago to care for her
son, police said.
   After setting himself afire, Imbert decided he didn't want to
die and jumped into a shower and put out the flames, police said.
   Imbert was in critical but stable condition at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center on Friday with second- and
third-degree burns over 25 percent of his body, said spokeswoman
Kathy Robinson.
   Imbert had worked as a word processing supervisor at a Manhattan
law firm until he left on disability in June.

<TEXT>
   Tourists anticipating a
vacation weekend in majestic Yosemite National Park saw their plans
go up in smoke Friday as lightning-sparked fires ravaged thousands
of acres.
   An estimated 10,000 people were held inside the park overnight
because fires blocked roads in and out of the preserve. They were
escorted out Friday morning; some just ended their travels early
and headed home and others headed elsewhere.
   Fires triggered by more than 21,000 lightning strikes during the
week burned more than 100,000 acres across California, including
12,000 acres and 66 structures in Yosemite by Friday. Initial
estimates of the number of buildings consumed by the fires was much
lower but after an inspection Friday, officials determined many
more had burned.
   A National Guard helicopter crashed Friday evening while the
craft was scooping water out of a pond in Tehama County, where a
wildfire was burning, officials said. One of the three crew members
suffered minor injuries, they said.
   ``They suspect that it may have been engine failure,'' said
National Guard Major Patricia Antosh. ``The crew was able to
evacuate themselves through the cockpit and get to shore.''
   The aircraft remained two-thirds submerged with the tail section
down, according to Antosh.
   Norbert and Edith Fischer of Mission Viejo, Calif., had planned
to spend two days in Yosemite, which is observing its 100th
birthday this year. Instead, they decided to move on to Sequoia
National Park, 170 miles to the south.
   ``I'm a lot disappointed because I read a chapter about it in my
social studies book,'' said their 10-year-old daughter, Lori. ``The
teacher told me to go up and see it. Now, I can't see it.''
   Her father promised to drive the 300 miles from Los Angeles back
to the park again, ``hopefully next year.''
   Besides the Yosemite fires, a fire in northern California's
Tehama County had burned 39,000 acres and one in the Sequoia
National Forest affected 17,000.
   Fires also raged in parts of Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada,
Utah and Washington state. Nearly 16,000 lightning strikes were
reported in the Western states in 24 hours, according to the Boise
Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates fire control
efforts. The center said 19,000 firefighters were at work in the
West.
   Three villages in the Yosemite area were evacuated at various
times, and 66 structures burned in one of them, known as Foresta,
in the Merced River Canyon. Most of the structures were probably
summer cabins, said Lisa Boyd, spokeswoman at the state Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection command center in Sacramento.
   Many people were anxious to leave Yosemite on Friday because
most lights were out in the valley Thursday night. Some people
unable to get back to their campsites had to sleep on makeshift
beds on hotel floors or in their cars.
   ``I felt sorry for people up just for the day who couldn't get
out,'' said Joe Salazar of Santa Fe Springs, Calif. ``There were
lines and lines of traffic trying to get out of the valley. We've
been coming here for 17 years, from the driest to the wettest. I've
never seen so much lightning.''
   His wife, Vivian, said the experience of vacationing behind fire
lines ``was interesting. It was also frightening, though.''
   Rachel Chang and Michael Zheng of Fremont, Calif., slept in
their car in Yosemite Valley for two nights after the road to their
campground was closed. After they were escorted out, they returned
to the gate to ask how they could retrieve their tent, sleeping
bags and clothes.
   Park Ranger Kevin McMillan advised them to ``sit tight and keep
waiting.'' He took Chang's name, address and telephone number.
   ``I know it's a big inconvenience, but we've got to be glad we
don't have people trapped up there,'' McMillan said.
   Salazar said he would return to the park some day.
   ``By the time I come back, they'll have trees again,'' he said.
   Elsewhere in the West, government land managers in southern
Idaho banned campfires and smoking outside of campgrounds beginning
at midnight Sunday. In Washington state, the Department of Natural
Resources banned all outdoor burning in Pierce, Mason and Kitsap
counties to reduce the risk of forest fires.
   A 60,000-acre range fire had ripped an 18-mile-long path through
sagebrush and grass about 35 miles northeast of Twin Falls in
southern Idaho.
   ``It looked like a cyclone with black clouds and a wall of flame
rising about a thousand feet in the air,'' said Bureau of Land
Management spokesman Dale Chatterton.
   A 73,700-acre complex of fires in Oregon had burned to within
one mile of the town of Riley and within three miles northwest of
Burns, a town of about 3,000, and its southern neighbor, Hines, a
town of about 1,500, officials said.
   The few residents of Riley were evacuated Wednesday night.
   ``Burns is still prepared for an immediate evacuation, but for
the moment it doesn't appear to be necessary,'' fire information
officer Don Jackson said Friday.
   There were nearly 1,000 people battling the fires Friday morning
and officials said two 500-member battalions from the Army's 1st
Division were scheduled to arrive in Burns during the weekend.

   Like shifting desert sand, boundaries in
the Middle East have changed through centuries of rule by Persians,
Greeks, Romans, Mongols and Ottomans _ as well as Arabs.
   In this century, colonial powers took part in setting borders
that at times have led to violent disputes. Among them are
conflicts between Arabs and Jews over the land known as Palestine,
civil war in Lebanon, and Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait.
   ``Kuwait is part of our country,'' the Iraqi government declared
Wednesday. It said the ``spiteful pencil and scissors of
imperialism'' had drawn maps years ago that were intended to
prevent the unity of the Arab people.
   When Islam came to Iraq in the 7th century, it had already
experienced 3,500 years of civilization, including the Babylonian
Empire led by Hammurabi, first codifier of laws.
   Baghdad was the center of the Arab world from 750 until the 13th
century, when Mongols sacked the city. The Turks absorbed the area
into their Ottoman empire 300 years later.
   Captured by Britain in 1916, Iraq became independent in 1932. A
military coup in 1958 ended the monarchy. Iraq's current president,
Saddam Hussein, came to power in 1979, also after a coup.
   As for Kuwait _ in the southeast corner on the Persian Gulf _
Mongols, Arab caliphs and Ottomans took turns as overlords. In
1899, the British became dominant.
   Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who fled to Saudi Arabia during
the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2, is a member of a clan that ruled under
the Ottomans and British after settling there in 1756. Kuwait
gained independence in 1961.
   Kuwait was threatened then by an Iraqi claim to sovereignty over
the territory. British troops responded at the request of the emir,
but the Arab League met and organized a force to replace them in
September 1961. Parts of the force remained until early 1963.
   Great care was taken in the drawing of many of the borders,
especially where oil was concerned. But stories abound of the
haphazard way in which other boundaries were formed.
   According to one story, when Winston Churchhill was drawing
Jordan's eastern border with Saudi Arabia, his elbow was jogged,
forming an angular curve in the desert known as ``Winston's Elbow.''
   Until Islam swept the country in the 7th century, Saudi Arabia
was isolated and polytheistic. The Ottomans ruled the land for 300
years until the British moved in during World War I and Lawrence of
Arabia rallied the desert warriors to rise against the Turks.
Conquests of King Ibn Saud brought most of the Arabian peninsula
into the modern state, formed in 1932.
   But the peninsula was not firmly delineated. It was not until
March that Saudi Arabia and Oman signed an accord drawing their
border.
   Oman and the United Arab Emirates have been trying to settle a
border dispute dating to the mid-1970s.
   Bahrain and Qatar have been at loggerheads over Huwar, a chain
of flyspeck islands along the Qatari coastline. The dispute dates
to the British colonial era, before the two Arab countries gained
independence.
   In 1603, Iran occupied Bahrain until it was expelled by forces
led by the Khalifa clan from Arabia. Iranian and Turkish claims
forced the Khalifas to seek British backing in 1861.
   Britain and the Ottoman empire acknowledged Bahrain's
independence in 1913. Britain effectively administered the islands
until full independence in 1968. Iran, once known as Persia, was
the center of an empire under King Cyrus in the 6th Century B.C.
   Alexander the Great defeated the Persians in 331 B.C.
   Arab Moslems later ruled for three centuries until defeated by
the Mongols in 1258. The Safavids and Qajars ruled in turn until
1925, when they were overthrown by Reza Khan.
   His son, the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, ascended the
throne in 1941 and was toppled in 1979 by the Moslem fundamentalist
revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Nations still are being formed in the Middle East.
   Earlier this year, North and South Yemen merged. Yemen, however,
also has unresolved border disputes with Saudi Arabia and Oman.

   The big machines lumber like
mechanical dinosaurs across a rippling sienna plain, churning
clouds of dirt and pulverized wheat as they reap the last harvest
of a vanishing nation.
   Like the clunky, outdated combines they drive, East Germany's
farmers are going through the motions, breaking down occasionally
but still pushing for the production quotas of the old Communist
government.
   They are enjoying their best grain harvest ever and still
raising beef, poultry and pork. Some experts say production overall
is down only a little, some say it is actually higher.
   But the old government no longer exists, nor do the trusty
distribution system and the state stores that had no choice but to
take what the farmers grew.
   Gone, too, are up to 70 percent of their customers.
   Faster than any other, the agricultural sector of East Germany's
economy is collapsing under the weight of competition. About half
the farms are technically bankrupt, economists say.
   Livestock raised and fed now is often just slaughtered and
stored. Vegetables carefully sown in the spring are rotting in the
summer. Grain sits unsold in countless silos.
   August is East Germany's first harvest as a free nation and its
last as a sovereign one. For many of the 800,000 farmers who work
on the Soviet-style collectives that once fed a captive market of
16 million people, this is the last harvest, period.
   ``We can't sell anything,'' said foreman Frank Simolka as he
stood in a wheat field outside of this village, four huge threshers
thundering in the background.
   ``We used to make about 70 marks ($44) for 200 kilograms of
wheat,'' said Simolka, 27. ``Now we're offered 18 marks ($11). What
kind of salaries can you pay if you can't make any money?''
   Schenkendorf is one several small, brown-and-gray farm villages
scattered in the district of Koenigs Wusterhausen, a farm belt
about 25 miles south of Berlin that is among the hardest hit
agricultural areas.
   It is a city of muddy-red roofs and cracked cobblestone streets.
At one end of the tiny downtown, six miles from Simolka's plant
operation, is a collection of stark gray buildings fortified by
barbed wire and heavy gates.
   Farmer Joachim Dommisch said the complex used to be a prison
camp for Jews during World War II. Now it is used as a dairy, pork
and poultry operation.
   It is one of 11 collectives in the district, eight of which are
considered bankrupt, said Dommisch, who is in charge of poultry
production.
   Employment at the Schenkendorf farm has dropped from 250 to 170
since the economic merger of the Germanys on July 1, when East
Germany became a free market.
   All remaining workers have taken cuts of $60 to $120 from their
former $566 monthly salaries, he said.
   Dommisch said his operation is selling, at most, 60 percent of
what it sold before July 1.
   ``The slaughterhouses are jammed with chickens, ducks, pigs and
cows,'' he said.
   Dommisch said the collectives are selling goods in streets and
at stands at cut-rate prices, aiming mostly for West Germans who
cruise farm areas looking for bargains.
   Paradoxically, East German grocery stores are stocking Western
products and charging prices often higher than in West Germany.
East German farmers are selling their goods, when they can, at much
lower prices set by the free market.
   Dommisch blamed that on the retail profit margin that didn't
exist under the former Communist government, which used to
subsidize both the prices in the stores and the amounts paid to
farmers.
   But the collectives are typically too large, inefficient and
overstaffed to compete with better-run Western agricultural
operations.
   The old distribution system also has fallen apart.
   Dommisch said his farm used to have a distributor who carried
products to 10 stores in East Berlin. Now, a distributor has to try
40 stops just to get rid of a particular shipment.
   Cows that produce the least milk are routinely slaughtered to
reduce feed costs, he said.
   His operation once got $1.13 for a liter of milk and now gets 38
cents.
   Experts say it is only a matter of time before such pricing
wipes out more than half the farm system.
   Walter Schwarzer, a spokesman for the East German agriculture
department, said the 820,000-member workforce will drop to 400,000
in two to three years.
   Andries Kurjo, a West Berlin economist and expert on East German
agriculture, said half the 4,500 collectives are technically
bankrupt, and one-third are meeting payrolls only because of a
special three-month government subsidy that ends in September.
   He said several sectors, such as sugar, starch and mustard,
already have disappeared. Mustard, for example, dropped from $377
for 220 pounds to $22.
   The crash comes during a summer of good weather and a record
grain harvest of 11.4 million tons.
   A collective farm near the southeastern city of Goerlitz has
harvested 9,500 tons of winter wheat this month but expects to sell
a third of it, said collective leader Lothar Wagner.
   ``Should we even bother to harvest it?'' he asked.
   Many officials say farmers have to become independent and break
up the collectives. Many farmers say they know no new ways, and
accuse the government of letting the system die.
   There were 270,000 jobless in East Germany last month, just over
3 percent, but unemployment is being kept low by a West
German-financed program to retain workers at shorter hours and
lower pay.
   There are 656,277 people in that program, with the largest
percentage _ 12.6 percent _ farmers.

   The jury in the Central Park jogger trial on
Friday reviewed the videotaped statement of a defendant who said he
twice kicked the female victim, climbed on top of her and feigned
sex to impress his friends.
   The jury asked to review the words of Antron McCray on the
second day of deliberations. McCray, 16, Yusef Salaam, 16, and
Raymond Santana, 15, are accused of gang raping and nearly killing
the woman on April 19, 1989.
   Written or videotaped statements from all three defendants are
considered the core of the case. Defense attorneys claim they were
coerced and should be ignored by the jury; the prosecution says
they are clear evidence of guilt.
   The jury retired at about 6:15 p.m., and was scheduled to resume
deliberations Saturday morning.
   On Thursday, Santana's confession was the center of attention.
Trial judge Thomas Galligan instructed jurors that the presence of
a parent was not required for legal questioning of a minor.
   Galligan's statement undercut the arguments of Santana defense
attorney Peter Rivera. The jury asked for copies of the written
statements from all three defendants on Thursday; McCray and
Santana also provided video statements under questioning from
police.
   McCray, Salaam and Santana are charged with attempted murder,
rape, sexual abuse, riot, assault and robbery in attacks on the
woman and on two male joggers.
   Prosecutors say the jogger was jumped and dragged into woods,
where she was gang-raped, bashed with a brick and a pipe and left
to die.
   The woman's recovery after the savage attack captured the
attention of the city and the nation. She is back at work as a vice
president at Salomon Brothers investment bankers.

   Eleanor Jordan was frightened when her
2{-year-old daughter fell out of bed and broke her nose and jaw,
but her fear was more than a mother's concern for an injured child.
   ``I didn't even want to take her to the doctor,'' she said. ``I
was absolutely terrified, because I knew what would happen.''
   She feared she would be charged with child abuse for the second
time. The broken nose and jaw Narelle suffered two summers ago were
her sixth and seventh fractures.
   Neither Mrs. Jordan nor her doctor knew then that her daughter
suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare ailment also known as
brittle bone disease.
   The disease leads to frequent fractures but often is difficult
to detect, and the inability of many parents, doctors and social
workers to recognize its symptoms has led to charges of child abuse
in a number of cases, experts say.
   The disease affects about 40,000 people across the country, said
Heidi Glauser, president of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation.
   About 500 members of the group are meeting this weekend in
Pittsburgh. Among the topics on the agenda are athletic
conditioning for brittle bone patients, their rights, and research
on the genetic cause of the disease, whch leads to a lack of the
protein collagen in bones.
   About once every two months, parents report to the organization
that they have been accused of child abuse, said Mrs. Glauser, of
Pittsburgh, whose 7-year-old son has the illness.
   Narelle's fractures resulted from spills and tumbles common to
toddlers.
   Her parents, of Norwood, Mass., did not learn about osteogenesis
imperfecta until after more than a year of trips to hospitals,
visits from police and investigations by social workers. A doctor
suspected the disease and sent Narelle to a geneticist, who
confirmed it in early 1989 through a tissue test.
   Mrs. Jordan remains bitter about the treatment her family
received. She blames many, especially doctors and social workers.
   ``I still go crazy because the medical profession could be so
ignorant and put us through the hell they did,'' she said Thursday.
``Here I was thinking everybody was on our side _ going to help us
_ and nobody was going to do anything except accuse us of child
abuse.''
   Authorities placed Narelle under the care of Mrs. Jordan's
mother for several days in 1987 after doctors who treated her for
two leg fractures reported the injuries to social workers, saying
they suspected child abuse. A judge allowed the girl to return to
her parents following a hearing.
   When Narelle was treated for the broken nose and jaw, the
family's lawyer urged Mrs. Jordan to take Narelle home rather than
leave her in the hospital.
   Shortly after they got home, three police cars and two social
workers arrived, seeking to take Norelle into protective custody,
but were stopped by the family lawyer.
   Anna and Steven Moxham of Stamford, N.Y., lost custody of their
daughter Dawn for six months this year because of abuse
allegations. The 2-year-old girl was returned to the couple in
June, after the diagnosis was confirmed through a tissue test.
   Now, Mrs. Moxham's biggest worry is what will happen if her
daughter breaks another bone.
   ``Am I going to go back to court because she sustained a
fracture? Because she fell? I can't live like that,'' she said. ``I
live my life on pins and needles.''
   An official at the National Association of Social Workers said
child-welfare workers know little about brittle-bone disease and
other conditions causing symptoms that could signal child abuse.
   ``The goal of these services is to protect the child, and the
system often responds with an initial decision based on that
protection,'' said Joan Zlotnik, staff director of the
association's Commission on Families.
   ``There needs to be information out there so parents aren't
wrongly accused,'' Ms. Zlotnik said in a telephone interview from
Silver Spring, Md. ``It is hard enough for them to deal with the
disease.''
   The Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation recently mailed 60,000
letters about brittle bone disease to police, paramedics, emergency
room doctors and social workers around the country, said Debbie
Morris, the foundation's vice president.

   The common border between Iraq and Jordan
is only 80 miles long, but the two countries are bound by close
military and political ties.
   Jordan's King Hussein forged a tight alliance with President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq during Baghdad's eight-year war with Iran.
The two countries have even formed a joint air force training
squadron.
   Jordan is a small, vulnerable kingdom surrounded by three mighty
neighbors in addition to Iraq: Israel, Syria and Saudi Arabia.
   At least half of Jordan's three million people are Palestinians.
Even in calmer times, Hussein performs a constant balancing act to
keep the allegiance of Palestinians who welcome anti-Israel moves
and conservative native Jordanians who fear the consequences.
   The arrival of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia has ignited
anti-American demonstrations in Jordan and calls by some
Palestinians there for a holy war against the United States.
   Jordan made no vote in Cairo Friday when an Arab summit decided
to send troops to protect Saudi Arabia.
   It is not clear if Jordan will obey U.N. and Arab League
economic sanctions against Iraq.
   Jordan has said, however, that it continues to recognize the
Kuwait government in place before the Iraqi invasion.

<TEXT>
   Far from the Persian Gulf, an oil war is raging
on the eighth floor of the World Trade Center.
   In skirmishes lasting 5{ hours at a time, brokers at the New
York Mercantile Exchange help set world oil prices by trading
contracts for future deliveries.
   When oil supplies were threatened by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
last week contracts for September delivery of crude jumped 31
percent from Aug. 2, the day of the invasion, to Tuesday's high.
   Contracts had retreated by Thursday's close on the New York
Merc. Friday's close was $26.23, a rise from the two previous days
but still down from Tuesday's high. The New York Merc is the
largest of only three futures markets in the world; the other two
are in London and Singapore.
   ``It's basically news- and rumor-driven at this point,'' said
broker Albert H. Helmig Jr.
   And trading is very physical. Visitors to the floor are bounced
around like pinballs by traders and clerks charging down the narrow
walkways. A closer look at the front lines, the crude oil pit, is
impossible. Brokers ring the pit five or six deep, jostling for
position and shouting things like ``Ten Sep!'' shorthand for 10
contracts in September.
   Deals are struck with trading partners through a refined series
of hand signals. Palms out, you're selling. Palms in, you're
buying. Once the deal is struck, the seller flips a card recording
the transaction into a net at the center of the pit. The card is
time-stamped and submitted for audit purposes.
   ``It's a definite physical advantage to be 6 feet tall, to be
loud. Body language counts,'' said Helmig, a tall, medium-built man.
   Profits, the spoils of this war, are won by detecting a market
swing before the opposition.
   Mistakes can be costly.
   ``If you miss something, it could be a dollar against you an
hour later,'' Helmig said. ``On a hundred lots, that's $100,000.''
   Lots, or contracts, cover 1,000 barrels. Trading hundreds of
lots in a single transaction is not uncommon, but in a market as
volatile as this week's the contracts get smaller.
   The effect on market volume is just the opposite. The
118-year-old Merc set a one-day record for trading volume Tuesday
when 306,338 contracts changed hands. Ninety percent was for crude
oil and other petroleum products, the exchange's dominant commodity.
   ``It's frenetic in the extreme,'' said broker Michael Wilner.
``The excitement level is certainly great.''
   Confidence and autonomy determine success, he said. The goal is
to find order in a chaotic market and capitalize on it. Brokers are
like gyroscopes, trying to stay upright when the room around them
is tilting.
   ``It's like hang-gliding,'' said Wilner. ``You're looking for
wind direction. You've got to be willing to change direction
quickly if the wind changes.''
   The wind changed Wednesday when rumors hit the floor that Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein had died or been shot. That triggered a
selloff.
   ``It really doesn't matter if Hussein dies ... what matters is
the order flow, the mood, the rhythm of the market. There was a
time to take some profits. There was a mood change in the market,''
Wilner said.
   September contracts closed down $2.35 on Wednesday, the first
retreat since the invasion began. A barrel of oil sold for $21.54
on Aug. 2, the day Iraq overran Kuwait, and had climbed to $28.32
on Tuesday. Contracts had retreated to $25.67 by Thursday's close.

<BYLINE>Chronic Stress Raises Risk of Low Birthweight Baby, Study Says
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chronic stress during pregnancy can raise the risk
of preterm birth and lead to reduced birthweight, a new study
suggests.
   The effect on birthweight appeared even apart from the impact on
length of pregnancy, said researcher Marci Lobel of the University
of California, Los Angeles. He reported the study Friday at the
annual meeting of the American Psychological Association.
   The effect of chronic stress on preterm birth is well known, but
a separate effect on birthweight has not been well established,
said Dr. Allan Katz, vice chairman of the department of obstetrics
and gynecology at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
   The new study by itself does not prove the latter idea, he
cautioned in a telephone interview.
   The research focused on 130 pregnant women ages 18 to 42.
Researchers repeatedly assessed their stress levels through the
pregnancy, starting at earlier than 20 weeks, Lobel said.
   Stress was defined as including anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and
being distressed by such events as the death of an emotionally
close person, legal difficulties and being robbed or mugged.
   Researchers found that the level of a woman's stress tended to
remain about the same through the pregnancy, Lobel said.
   Analysis found that stress contributed to preterm birth as much
as medical risk factors did, she said. The medical factors included
such signs as diabetes before pregnancy, and bleeding, high blood
pressure, drug abuse or smoking during pregnancy.
   Lobel suggested that stress may exert its effects in two ways.
One is that women under stress may take less good care of
themselves during pregnancy, she said.
   The other possibility is that stress can affect levels of bodily
substances that are implicated in impairing oxygen and blood supply
to the fetus, and in triggering onset of labor, she said.
   Scientists are concerned about preterm births because they lead
to a high death rate, and low-birthweight survivors run an unusual
risk of such handicaps as cerebral palsy, chronic lung problems,
epilepsy, blindness, deafness and mental retardation, according to
the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.

<HEAD>Red Cross Centralizes Blood Bank Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Red Cross blood services are under a new,
centralized, national management designed to correct problems with
the way blood bank accidents and errors are reported, reviewed and
followed up.
   The Red Cross said Friday it is scrapping its current system of
local control in each of 54 blood services regions, which supply
blood to more than half the hospitals in the United States.
   Instead, each regional program will be run by an officer named
and paid for by the national headquarters _ and the officers will
report to a new senior vice president whose only responsibility
will be the group's $500 million blood bank program, the nation's
largest.
   The Red Cross also announced major expansions at its national
headquarters. The staff responsible for evaluating the local blood
programs and following up on their accident and error reports will
double from eight to 16. And the unit that makes sure the Red Cross
complies with federal regulations will nearly triple from five
people to 14.
   The changes symbolize a ``recommitment to our goal of ensuring
that the American people can count on a blood supply that is safe
and adequate to meet their needs,'' said Red Cross Chairman George
F. Moody.
   He said the restructuring arose from ``searing
self-examination'' as well as months of scrutiny by the news media
and the Food and Drug Administration.
   Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said the agency is encouraged by
the Red Cross' latest moves _ particularly the trend to centralize
operations.
   ``We feel that the steps they've outlined today are a very
significant movement toward ... improving the overall efficacy and
safety of their system,'' Stone said.
   He said many of the past deficiencies noted by the FDA ``have
been in part due to problems with standardized procedures and
communications between the national office and various centers.''
   One FDA inspector, Mary Carden, told a congressional hearing
last month that the national headquarters sometimes took months to
review reports of AIDS cases associated with transfusions of blood
collected by Red Cross centers.
   Carden also said she found that the headquarters staff had
violated FDA regulations at times by failing to file reports on
cases in which donors tested positive for hepatitis or were at risk
for contracting the AIDS virus.
   FDA notification is required in such cases even if the blood is
discarded. There are also indications that some centers were not
reporting all of the cases of suspect blood to the national
headquarters, the federal agency said.
   Moody said a huge backlog of unreviewed accident and error
reports was behind some of the FDA complaints. He said the backlog
is almost cleared up.
   Stephen Richards, named Friday as executive vice president of
the Red Cross, acknowledged there have been procedural and
record-keeping problems. But he added that ``we have not seen any
evidence of contaminated blood ... being transfused into a
patient'' as a result of those problems.
   Moody said the new centralized structure became necessary
because of the increasing complexity of the blood services business
in the past few years. He cited new tests for hepatitis and the
AIDS virus as major factors.

   The company that runs the Fernald, Ohio,
uranium processing plant for the government lost out on $1.2
million because the Energy Department wasn't happy with its cleanup
work.
   The department threatens to veto $1.67 million more in bonus
fees if Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio doesn't get better marks
on its next six-month review.
   The bonus money is in addition to the $833,334 the contractor is
paid every six months to run the weapons plant for the government.
   In the past, bonuses have been virtually automatic, but in
response to criticism from Congress and elsewhere the Energy
Department has started tying the payments more closely to
contractor performance.
   Westinghouse's latest evaluation, for the half-year ending March
31, included some praise for the contractor's performance but the
Energy Department ``judged overall performance to be marginal,''
wrote Joe LaGrone, manager of the Oak Ridge, Tenn., office, which
supervises the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald.
   In a letter to the contractor he said evaluators found
deficiencies in complying with every major federal environmental
law, including the Clean Air Act, Toxic Substances Control Act,
Superfund law and the primary waste law, Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act.
   Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse did not appeal the diminished
bonus of $416,667 but did file a two-page response promising the
company ``is firmly committed to significantly improve our overall
rating by demonstrating performance excellence.''
   Westinghouse said it has given about half of the Fernald
``environmental compliance'' workers off-site training and has
developed a training school ``to better prepare supervisors and
professionals at its (government-owned sites) to meet the
challenges of environmental compliance.''
   Workers from six Westinghouse-run plants will attend that school
beginning in September, the contractor said in a letter dated July
23.
   Until a year ago, the Fernald plant processed uranium for
nuclear weapons.
   Production was halted so that workers could focus on cleaning up
the highly contaminated complex, which houses leaking drums of
mixed waste dating back to the 1950s and massive silos holding some
of the radioactive remains of the World War II-era Manhattan
Project.
   Another $1.67 million bonus is on the line with the next review,
covering April 1 through Sept. 30, Energy Department spokesman
Steve Wyatt said from Oak Ridge on Friday.

   Here is a summary of the charges against Mayor
Marion Barry, the outcome of jury deliberations and the evidence
introduced by both sides on each of them.
   Barry was convicted on Count 12, a misdemeanor possession charge
carrying a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $100,000 fine.
All the possession and conspiracy charges carried a similar penalty.
   The mayor was acquitted on Count 3, another misdemeanor.
   The jury was unable to agree on the other counts, including
three felony perjury charges each carrying a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The government has not
decided whether to seek another trial on these charges.

   Israel will ask a united Germany for $1.5
billion to cover East Germany's unpaid debt to Holocaust victims,
an Israeli newspaper has reported.
   Foreign Minister David Levy will make the request when he meets
with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in Bonn
next week, the independent Haaretz daily said Friday in an
unsourced report.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the meeting but denied the sum cited by the
newspaper.
   West Germany has paid more than $40 billion in Holocaust
reparations to Israel. But for 40 years East Germany's hard-line
Communist leaders ousted last fall had refused to pay, arguing they
themselves were persecuted by the Nazis.

   Jerry Nickens has seen the changes Marion
Barry wrought as mayor of the nation's capital for 12 years and
says it was no surprise that the government couldn't nail Barry on
drug and perjury charges.
   ``Tell me something, what did all of this prove?'' Nickens asked
Friday after a jury convicted Barry of a single cocaine-possession
charge and acquitted him of another, with a mistrial declared on a
dozen other counts.
   ``Nothing! That's what it proved,'' said Nickens, a black,
16-year veteran of the District of Columbia fire department.
   Within hours after the jury ended its deliberations, impromptu
celebrations broke out in largely black areas of the city. Near the
mayor's house, motorists honked their horns and shouted, ``Barry,
Barry,'' and ``Four more years.'
   Several churches opened for unscheduled services as word spread
of the outcome of the trial.
   Jim Myers, a white resident of suburban Prince George's County,
Md., didn't share the jubilation.
   ``It was a lot of trial and a lot of error,'' he said. ``The
government should have known that it was never going to get a
conviction of a black mayor by a predominantly black jury in a
predominantly black city.''
   Nickens, speaking from a different perspective, said he joined
the fire department in 1974 when most of the senior officers and
commanders were white and only a small percentage of firefighters
were black.
   ``Barry opened doors for people like me, a black high school
dropout to become somebody, to get jobs and opportunities that we
were never to get before,'' Nickens said.
   ``I'm a Marion Barry man, always have been and always will be.
He's done a lot of good things for this city that nobody wants to
give him credit for. You can't take that away from him.''
   Barry and supporters argued that vindictive federal prosecutors
singled him out and spent millions to prosecute him, partly because
he is black. The case exposed deep racial divisions in Washington,
two-thirds of whose residents are black.
   ``The mayor now knows that he can't trust anybody,'' said
Chantala Burton, a 21-year-old native Washingtonian. ``All of his
so-called friends were so willing to speak against him. All I can
say now is they better watch their backs.''

<HEAD>Report: Lower Cholesterol Could Lead to Violent Death or Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men with lower cholesterol are more likely to die
from accidents, suicide or violence, according to a report
published in the British Journal of Medicine.
   University of Pittsburgh researchers found a ``highly
significant'' association between lowered cholesterol levels and
higher death rates from suicide, accidents or violence in their
analyis of six studies.
   In the article published Friday, the authors said the
association could result from changes in moods or cognitive
functions, such as concentration, brought about by alterations in
lifelong eating or behavioral patterns.
   ``There is some experimental evidence that modifying the fat in
the diet has both neurochemical and behavioral consequences,'' the
study said.
   The researchers said their findings back-up previous studies
which reported lower cholesterol levels among criminals, people
with violent or aggressive conduct disorders, homicidal offenders
and people with low self-control.
   It was not immediately clear whether the findings were also true
for women.

   The Saudi Arabian government is agreeing to
admit a pool of journalists from the United States to cover the
U.S. military deployment under way in the desert kingdom, the
Pentagon says.
   ``We are working to get the pool in there as quickly as
possible,'' Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Friday.
   Williams said the small group of reporters and photographers who
will travel to Saudi Arabia will be drawn from among
Washington-based journalists whose names had been submitted
previously to the Defense Department.
   ``It will be the organizations normally represented on the DoD
pool,'' Williams said. Generally, they include representatives from
The Associated Press and other news services, the television
networks, several newspapers and broadcast outlets.
   Pentagon officials had been negotiating with Saudi Ambassador
Prince Bandar Bin Sultan over press coverage of the operation,
code-named Desert Shield. There was no press coverage of the
initial deployment, and news organizations had been clamoring for
access.
   ``This is a good step, essential'' said Jonathan P. Wolman,
Washington bureau chief for The Associated Press. ``It simply isn't
possible to provide adequate coverage of the Saudi desert
deployment without having reporters on the ground with the troops.''
   The Pentagon said members of the pool would leave this weekend
with its first stop at McDill Air Force Base in Florida before
leaving for Saudi Arabia.
   It said a separate regional pool of reporters currently in the
Middle East will visit the aircraft carrier USS Independence in the
Gulf of Oman.
   Members of the regional pool would visit the Aegis cruiser USS
Antietam in the Persian Gulf on Tuesday.
   Journalists had complained to the Pentagon about being excluded
from covering the deployment of thousands of military forces that
President Bush ordered earlier this week.
   Burl Osborne, president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors and the president and editor of The Dallas Morning News,
and Jerry Friedheim, president of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association, were among those who had written Williams to protest.
   ``We now have a situation in which an increasing number of
American troops are deployed in dangerous areas in the Middle East,
and the American press is not being given access to the U.S.
military forces,'' they said on Thursday.
   Williams _ and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney _ said the Saudis
controlled who went in and out of their country.
   ``The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia controls its borders and decides
who enters that country, and that's not for us to tell the Saudis
who comes in,'' Williams said Thursday.
   Saudi Arabia is a traditionally conservative society that keeps
tight control over who enters the country. No foreign journalists
are stationed there permanently, although they have received
temporary visas to cover events.
   The Pentagon pool arrangement was set up after the U.S. invasion
of Grenada, when journalists were kept away from the Caribbean
island entirely.
   Although there have been several tests of the Pentagon media
pool, it didn't work well in the U.S. invasion of Panama last
December. Instead of being taken to the front lines of battle as
promised, the reporters were kept bottled up away from the action.

<HEAD>Facts About Magellan and Venus</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Magellan-Venus, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some unusual facts about the
Magellan spacecraft and Venus, culled from ``The Magellan Venus
Explorer's Guide'' and other NASA publications:
   _Getting Magellan to Venus required three main engines and two
rockets on the shuttle Atlantis that carried it into Earth orbit,
two rockets on the inertial upper-stage booster that hurled it
toward Venus, and one braking rocket to slow it down for entry into
orbit around Venus. But for 99 percent of Magellan's
948-million-mile trip to Venus, it cruised without power.
   _Venus is named for the Roman goddess of love. It's
continent-like highlands are named after Aphrodite, the Greek love
goddess, and Ishtar, the Baylonian love goddess.
   _Temperatures and pressures on Venus are equivalent to
conditions inside a 900-degree Fahrenheit self-cleaning oven 3,000
feet below the surface of an ocean on Earth.
   _Magellan will collect and send to Earth more computerized
information than the combined total from all previous U.S. missions
to other planets.
   _After about a dozen years, Magellan will lack enough propellant
to fire its thrusters and maintain its orbit. The orbit will decay
and the spacecraft eventually will plunge into the Venusian
atmosphere and burn up.
   _When Magellan uses its radar to map Venus' landscape, it will
consume 200 watts of electricity, about the same as a bright floor
lamp.
   _If Magellan flew over Earth's Mount St. Helens volcano, it
could recognize it as a mountain. The radars on Soviets' Venera 15
and 16 spacecraft, which were launched in 1983, wouldn't be able to
distinguish Mount St. Helens from a meteorite impact crater.
   _The Soviet Union named two craters on Venus after teacher
Sharon McAuliffe and astronaut Judith Resnick, who were among seven
crew members killed when Challenger exploded after liftoff in 1986.
   _When Magellan fired its braking rocket to start orbiting Venus
on Friday, the spacecraft experienced a maximum force seven times
the force of gravity on Earth.
   _During each orbit around Venus, Magellan will travel about
38,314 miles as an average speed of 12,163 mph.

   With Magellan safely in orbit around
Venus today, exuberant NASA engineers started preparing the
spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped
the landscape of the hellishly hot planet.
   ``We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and
volcanoes,'' said Bill Johnson, chief engineer for Magellan's radar
imaging system.
   Geologists hope the $744 million exploration will reveal ``the
way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and
the way volcanoes work,'' said Steve Saunders, chief Magellan
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The mapping is set
to start next month.
   On Friday, Magellan plunged over the north pole of Venus, fired
its braking rocket and dropped into an elliptical orbit that ranges
from about 171 miles to 5,054 miles above the planet's surface.
   ``We made it!'' said Carolynn Young, a Magellan project team
member. ``I had goose bumps from head to toe. It's wonderful.''
   The spacecraft successfully jettisoned the retrorocket Friday
night, laboratory spokesman Bob MacMillin said.
   He said engineers' plans for today included monitoring
Magellan's performance and collecting precise information on its
orbit _ details needed for successful mapping.
   Magellan's arrival at Venus broke a string of bad luck for NASA.
Hydrogen gas leaks have grounded the shuttle fleet temporarily and
a mirror focusing flaw severely impaired the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.
   Magellan is equipped with radar designed to peer through the
thick Venusian clouds and unveil the landscape of the second planet
from the sun. On Sept. 1, it will start mapping by bouncing radar
waves off Venus and capturing the echoes.
   NASA said the radar should be able to yield pictures and maps of
about 90 percent of Venus at a level of detail 10 times better than
in images produced by two Soviet Venera spacecraft that were
launched in 1983. It should be able to detect features as small as
about two football fields.
   ``It's like going to the Grand Canyon instead of having someone
tell you about it,'' mission analyst Rob Lock said.
   Magellan project manager Tony Spear said some worthwhile
pictures of Venus' surface may be produced by radar tests that
start next Thursday, but ``it is most likely in September ... that
we will get images of sufficient quality.''
   Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989,
starting a roundabout 948-million-mile journey to Venus. It met the
planet at a distance of 144 million miles from Earth.
   Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor other than the moon, and is
similar to Earth in size, mass, density and position.
   Magellan may reveal similarities and differences between the two
planets, including whether any of Venus' volcanoes are active and
whether its surface features are formed by large-scale movements of
gigantic plates of rocky crust.
   It also will look for signs that the bone-dry planet may have
had oceans before a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Saunders said
Magellan has no ability to determine what caused global warming on
Venus, but may find clues to when it started.
   Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science,
called Magellan's arrival at Venus ``the beginning of one of the
most exciting eras of planetary exploration'' _ a period that
includes upcoming missions to Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, asteroids and
comets.
   Magellan was the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since
Pioneers 12 and 13 were sent to Venus in 1978, and also the first
launched from a shuttle.
   Magellan, named for 16th century global circumnavigator
Ferdinand Magellan, is 21 feet long and 15 feet wide. After firing
the heavy fuel-filled braking rocket, its 3.7-ton weight dropped to
less than 1.5 tons, Spear said.

<HEAD>Former Reagan Official Named to Head Legal Services</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former head of the Reagan administration
Office of Government Ethics, David H. Martin, was appointed
president of the Legal Services Corp., a spokesman says.
   Martin was named to the presidency of the publicly supported
corporation on Thursday by the board of directors.
   A private attorney in Washington, Martin was director of the
Office of Government Ethics from 1983 to 1987. He had previously
been chief counsel to the Secret Service and a Justice Department
prosecutor specializing in organized crime.
   The board met twice in the last two weeks to select a new
president for the corporation, which has become a political
battleground between liberals and conservatives over its proper
role in representing indigent clients.
   The board also approved a resolution asking Congress not to lift
a longtime ban on the use of federal funds to pursue cases
involving abortion rights.
   State and local legal services chapters that receive public
money from other sources that is earmarked for that purpose are
allowed to represent women in abortion-rights cases.
   Legal aid lawyers in California recently won a court case
overturning a state decision to cut support for Planned Parenthood
counseling services, which included giving advice to women about
abortion.
   The $320 million legal services authorization bill pending in
the House Judiciary Committee contains a provision that lifts a
longstanding ban on the use of federal funds for abortion cases.
The proposal was contained in a version of the bill passed by a
subcommittee.
   David Eisner, a spokesman for the Legal Services Corp., said the
new president favors the current restrictions on abortion
litigation. The position pays up to $78,200 annually but the board
has not completed negotiations on a salary with Martin.

<HEAD>National Geographic Unites Two Germanys In New Atlas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Geographic Society is
anticipating history by unifying East and West Germany and
decentralizing the Soviet Union in its new world atlas, Society
officials say.
   The sixth edition of the National Geographic Atlas of The World
removes the red line that separated the two Germanys in past
editions and refers only to the nation of ``Germany.''
   ``We've had to look into our crystal ball and see that the
unification of Germany is inevitable,'' John B. Garver, National
Geographic's chief cartographer, said Friday.
   The atlas shows both Bonn and Berlin as capitals, but features
only the West German flag. The page on Germany was printed at a
Willard, Ohio, publishing house Thursday and Friday, with the new
edition of 240,000 copies to be released in November.
   Unification is scheduled to take place in December, although the
East German parliament has called for the first all-German
elections and the merging of the two Germanys on Oct. 14.
   Spokeswoman Barbara Hand Fallon said National Geographic's first
new atlas since 1981 drops the letters ``S.S.R.,'' or Soviet
Socialist Republic, from ll Soviet states except Russia to reflect
impulses within the Soviet Union for greater independence.
   The capitals of such states as Lithuania have been clearly
marked in the event they later gain independence from Moscow, she
said.
   Other political changes to be reflected in the new book are the
recent unification of North and South Yemen and the de facto
division of Cyprus.
   The Middle East map will be flagged with a note that ``On Aug.
2, 1990, Iraqi military forces invaded Kuwait.''
   ``It's a precarious time to be putting out a world atlas,'' Miss
Fallon said.

<HEAD>Former Reagan Administration Official Testifies Before Grand Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Reagan administration aide who worked
with John Poindexter and Oliver North is giving federal grand jury
testimony before the panel investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
   Ronald Sable, an ex-National Security Council staff member,
declined to discuss his testimony as he left the U.S. Courthouse on
Friday. Sable was a witness at Poindexter's criminal trial in March.
   A retired Air Force colonel, Sable is now vice president for
legislative liaison at aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Sable was the NSC's legislative affairs director in 1986 when
Congress renewed its inquiries into reports that North was secretly
assisting the Nicaraguan Contras in defiance of a congressional ban
on U.S. military aid to the rebels.
   At Poindexter's trial, Sable testified that the national
security adviser decided to ``follow the line'' of Poindexter's
predecessor, Robert McFarlane. McFarlane in 1985 denied that North
was raising money or coordinating the Contra military effort.
   Poindexter sent responses to Congress endorsing McFarlane's
denials, which McFarlane eventually admitted were false. Shortly
after Poindexter's letters were sent, North denied in a
face-to-face meeting with the House intelligence committee that he
had armed the Contras.
   Sable testified that he did not know the denials were false.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he misled
Congress when he denied North's contra military aid in letters to
three House committees.
   Poindexter was convicted of obstruction of Congress in
connection with his denials that North was assisting the Congress.
Poindexter also was convicted of four other felony counts. His
lawyers have said the conviction will be appealed.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh, said she would have no comment on Sable's
grand jury appearance.
   Since the end of May, North has appeared six times before the
grand jury and Poindexter has appeared once.

<HEAD>Former Thornburgh Aide Indicted on Cocaine Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID MORRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top adviser to U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh was indicted on charges he used cocaine
during Thornburgh's five-year rise from Pennsylvania's governor to
the nation's top prosecutor.
   It was the fourth time since May that long-time Thornburgh aides
have fallen from grace. Two were reassigned after deception on FBI
polygraph tests and a third resigned after his security clearance
was revoked.
   Former Justice Department lawyer Henry G. Barr, 47, was charged
Friday with one count of cocaine possession, two counts of making
false statements and one count of conspiracy.
   The indictment returned by a grand jury in Harrisburg accuses
Barr of using cocaine from December 1984 to January 1988, and again
on April 8, 1989 _ about one month before he resigned his federal
post and resumed private practice.
   Barr, who lives in a Harrisburg suburb, first worked with
Thornburgh during the 1970s when Thornburgh was a federal
prosecutor in Pittsburgh. He became the governor's chief counsel in
1985 and followed Thornburgh to the Justice Department in 1988.
   The grand jury said Barr ``conspired with others to obtain,
possess and use cocaine and to conceal his cocaine involvement from
outside scrutiny.''
   Barr allegedly lied on a federal form that asked if he used or
provided illegal drugs within the last five years. He repeated the
false statement in a subsequent interview with the FBI, the
indictment said.
   If convicted on all counts, Barr could face a sentence of up to
12 years in prison and fines of $510,000. The false-statement
counts are felonies that carry possible five-year jail terms.
   In a statement issued in Washington, Thornburgh praised Barr as
``a capable lawyer who devoted many years of his career to public
service.''
   He said he was disqualifying himself from any involvement in
Barr's prosecution.
   ``I have no knowledge of the particular circumstances of this
case,'' Thornburgh said. ``It is now up to a judge and jury to
determine the facts of this case and their consequences for Mr.
Barr.''
   No one answered the telephone at Barr's Mechanicsburg home
Friday afternoon. His lawyer, Charles F. Scarlata, said in a
statement that Barr would plead innocent.
   ``The ultimate irony here is there is not even a suggestion from
any source that Mr. Barr performed his duties in other than a
thoroughly professional, honest, competent and loyal manner,'' the
statement said.
   Several top Justice Department officials have bowed out of the
investigation, including acting U.S. Attorney James West. West's
chief assistant, Gordon A.D. Zubrod, has been assigned to prosecute
the case.
   Barr was the first public official charged in a 15-month-long
federal investigation of cocaine use in the Harrisburg area.
   His indictment follows personnel troubles Thornburgh has faced
with three other aides who followed him from Pennsylvania to
Washington.
   In May, Thornburgh reassigned top aides David Runkel and Robin
Ross to less sensitive positions after it was disclosed that they
had showed deception on FBI polygraph tests during an investigation
of an unauthorized news leak.
   Last month, aide Barry Stern resigned from the Justice
Department when agency officials revoked his temporary security
clearance.
   All three men served under Thornburgh when he was governor.
Stern was labor and industry secretary, Runkel was his press
secretary and Ross was a special assistant.

   Todd Bridges, the former child star of
television's ``Diff'rent Strokes'' being retried on an assault
charge, accused the district attorney's office of singling him out
for prosecution.
   ``The D.A.'s office has something against me, period,'' Bridges
said Friday as jury selection got under way for his retrial on a
felony assault charge stemming from the shooting of an unarmed man
in a house where drugs were on sale.
   If convicted, the 25-year-old actor faces a maximum six-year
sentence.
   Bridges starred as Willis Jackson, older brother to Gary
Coleman's Arnold Jackson, in the ``Diff'rent Strokes'' series that
ran from 1978 to 1986.
   He was acquitted last year of attempted murder and attempted
involuntary manslaughter in the shooting of Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay in
a Los Angeles house on Feb. 2, 1989. Bridges testified he was too
high on cocaine to remember what happened.
   Clay was shot eight times and had his throat and face slashed
with a knife at a house where police said crack cocaine was
allegedly being sold. He survived.
   Jurors could not reach a verdict on the charge of assault with a
deadly weapon, and prosecutors refiled that charge.

   Families around the nation stayed close to their telephones and
television sets, hoping for clues to the uncertain fates of
American relatives stranded when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi troops
rolled into Kuwait.
   ``I'm getting hostile. I'm getting frustrated,'' said Kevin
York, who last spoke to his pregnant wife, Faye, two weeks ago. The
State Department ``said it could be an hour or it could be four or
five days. I can't just sit and wait.''
   York, a resident of Mount Prospect, Ill., said his wife and her
mother were caught while visiting their Iraqi homeland for the
first time in 15 years.
   Saddam's call Friday for an Arab ``holy war'' against all
enemies of Islam only heightened fears among relatives of the
estimated 3,500 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait during the Aug. 2
invasion.
   It was during the takeover's early hours that the Rev. Edwin
Davis of Koran, La., last heard from his daughter, who with her
husband and children was visiting a relative in Kuwait.
   ``They said they were under attack and that helicopters were
flying overhead,'' Davis, 68, said in a telephone interview Friday.
``(My daughter) told us not to worry, that they'd be OK.''
   But such fleeting assurances are of little solace to relatives
as Saddam digs in his heels and thousands of American troops
prepare to defend Saudi Arabia.
   ``They may not be called hostages but in reality they are,''
Davis said. ``I doubt if they'll be released because Hussein is
kind of a ruthless character and he's going to play it smart ...
use them as a shield. It's his ace in the hole.''
   Still, some trapped Americans have already broken free of the
Iraqi army's hold, trickling over the borders of Kuwait or Iraq and
back home to share with relatives their daring tales of escape.
   An American basketball coach, his wife and their three poodles
drove through a sandstorm before bolting past Iraqi troops. They
had a joyous reunion Friday with family members in San Antonio.
   ``Once we made the decision to leave, we started off on the road
and didn't turn back,'' said Jim Calvin, coach of the Kuwaiti
national basketball team. ``It was 3{ hours of solid driving
through a sandstorm. My radiator had a hole, and I wasn't sure if
it was going to make it.''
   Calvin said the blond hair of his wife, Phyllis, made her an
obvious target in the Arab country.
   ``I just ducked as low as I could get and told my wife to get on
the floorboard, but nobody chased us,'' he said. ``The third time
we stopped, two soldiers walked around the car and we bolted. They
gave us the opening and we just took off.''
   While the Calvins embraced family at San Antonio International
Airport early Friday, one of their friends from Kuwait was doing
the same in New Mexico.
   After learning that a can of Diet Pepsi had helped Steve Betts,
35, gain his freedom, officials at Pepsico Inc. loaned him their
corporate jet for the last leg of his escape from Kuwait City back
to Santa Fe.
   The swim coach for Kuwait's national team was driving toward the
Saudi border when a thirsty Iraqi soldier stopped his car and asked
for water. Betts handed over a can of diet cola and the soldier
waved him on.
   Relatives of an Oregon family also encountered Iraqi troops
while wending their way back to safety.
   ``We saw the whole business, the troops, the arms, the cannons,
the fires, everything,'' said Kim El-Zahr, who escaped Wednesday
with her husband and two young children.
   She said the family survived a 12-hour road trip in sizzling
desert heat and endured a six-hour wait while their passports were
processed at the Saudi border.
   Among the most worried loved ones was Peter Nabakov, whose
10-year-old daughter, Penelope, was aboard a flight into Kuwait
City that was detained by Iraqi forces. He refused to speak with
reporters Friday, saying he had to stay by the phone and keep the
line open for official word on the girl's whereabouts.
   Neighbor children in Albany, Calif., fretted about their
playmate despite the good news that she was transferred Wednesday
from a Baghdad hotel to the U.S. embassy in the Iraqi capital.
   ``It's really freaky, having a friend being captured over
there,'' said Carmen Dworkin-Ojeda, 10.

   A rare New York City tornado uprooted trees,
smashed houses and cars, and downed power lines while cutting a
narrow swath through the Staten Island borough.
   There were no reports of injuries in the tornado Friday, but
four people were treated for hysteria, said Emergency Medical
Services spokesman Robert Leonard.
   Lt. Jim Powell, a fire department spokesman, said trees torn
from the ground fell on houses, cars and power lines, cutting off
electricity and telephone service, and also causing a gas leak.
   ``A few people were emotionally upset with damage done to their
houses and cars, but no one was physically hurt,'' Powell said.
   The tornado began as a water spout in Lower New York Bay that
hit land in the Grant City-Midland Beach area of Staten Island,
said Anthony Gigi of the National Weather Service. Police termed it
a ``mini-tornado'' because damage was centered in a three- to
four-block area.
   The hardest-hit streets have small, Cape Cod-style houses and
large sycamore trees planted before World War II. At least a dozen
trees were torn from their roots.
   George Platoni, who lives near two Freemont Avenue homes that
suffered crushed roofs, said he looked from a window to see trees
bending in the wind.
   ``I decided to go out and take a look, and just like that, they
were gone, fast, fast, fast, fast,'' Platoni said.
   Tom Pica, a spokesman for New York Telephone, said about 100
customers were without phone service because a branch fell on a
cable. Service would probably be restored today, he said.
   About 100 customers lost electrical power, but by late Friday,
all but 20 had power restored, said Consolidated Edison spokeswoman
Rosalie Zuckerman.
   Bob Loftus, a spokesman for Brooklyn Union Gas, said two gas
lines were pulled out when trees were uprooted. The utility shut
down service for the whole block to stop leaks. He said that about
50 homes were affected.
   The tornado was the first to hit New York since Oct. 5, 1985,
when a tornado hit the borough of Queens, causing six injuries and
negligible damage, Gigi said. No major tornadoes have hit New York
this century.

   Iraqi air force pilots
acquired a reputation during the eight-year war with Iran for
timidity against real targets and reckless flying near unintended
ones.
   The most notable example of Iraqi recklessness in the Persian
Gulf war was the attack by an Iraqi jet on the U.S. missile frigate
Stark on May 17, 1987, in which 37 American sailors were killed.
   The French F-1 Mirage jet fired two Exocet missiles at the
Stark, triggering fires that nearly sank the vessel. Iraq later
apologized for the incident saying the pilot had mistaken the Stark
for an Iranian ship.
   Some U.S. officers said they suspected Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein was trying to draw the United States into the Iraq-Iran
war, knowing that any tilt would be against Iran.
   During the conflict, the Iraqis used their air force to strike
at Iran's terminals and tankers in the northern Gulf. Crewmen
aboard U.S. warships observed some such attacks on radar and
sometimes with the naked eye.
   American officers said the Iraqi pilots were skillful, but so
wary of anti-aircraft defenses around Iran's big Kharg Island oil
terminal that they often launched their missiles from maximum range.
   This, the officers said, burned most of the missiles' fuel and
effectively reduced their explosive power on impact.
   Overall, Iraq's raids were of questionable value. Iran was able
to keep its oil flowing from Kharg throughout the war, which ended
in cease-fire in August 1988.
   On Thanksgiving Day, 1987, Captain John Luke of the U.S. missile
cruiser Richmond K. Turner came within what he said was ``a split
second'' of launching missiles at three Iraqi Mirages that ignored
warnings to keep clear.
   After another close call between a U.S. destroyer and a
missile-firing Iraqi jet in February 1988, the United States sent
officers to Baghdad to work out procedures to protect U.S. ships
from a repeat of the Stark incident.
   The only other direct encounter between the U.S. Navy and the
Iraqi air force in the gulf was of a different sort.
   In September 1987, the helicopter carrier Guadalcanal rescued an
Iraqi pilot who had been shot down two days earlier by the Iranians
and was drifting in a rubber raft.

<HEAD>Electrician Gets Five-Year Sentence for Fatal Fire Caused By
Faulty Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An electrician whose faulty work caused
a house fire in which a 12-year-old boy died was sentenced to five
years in prison.
   National trade groups said the case marked the first time an
electrician was found criminally liable for work that caused a
fatal fire. The judge also called it a unique case.
   Richard E. Salz, 49, was convicted in June of second-degree
manslaughter in the death of Burton Gorman III, who died of smoke
inhalation in a 1988 house fire in the neighboring town of East
Haven.
   In passing sentence Friday, Superior Court Judge Joseph T.
Gormley Jr. said he found disturbing Salz's unwillingness to accept
any blame for the fire. He also ordered Salz to serve five years'
probation after his prison term.
   Defense attorney James Ullman said that, at most, Salz was
guilty of sloppy workmanship. He said the verdict would be appealed.
   Investigators said Salz's faulty installation of a heating unit
in the basement of the home of Burton H. and Louise Gorman, the
victim's grandparents, caused the fire. Prosecutor Michael
Dearington said Salz did not simply make a mistake but was guilty
of ``flagrant, reprehensible, egregious work.''
   The fire was linked to a baseboard heating unit Salz had
installed in the basement.
   Salz connected the 120-volt heating unit to a 240-volt circuit
box, causing it to overheat and the wall paneling to ignite. He
also failed to attach a nut that would have tripped the circuit
breaker when the heater short-circuited, prosecutors said.
   Salz committed numerous other electrical code violations,
ignored the manufacturers's instructions for installing the heater
and failed to get a permit for the job, they said.
   Despite the criminal charge against him, the state Electrical
Work Examining Board this spring gave Salz a journeyman's
electrician's license, which requires that his work be supervised.
His contractor's license, which allows an electrician to work
without supervision, was revoked in July 1989.
   Ullman said Salz has been unable to get a job as an electrician
but has been working as a plumber.

<HEAD>Judge Rules U.S. Violated Mexican Treaty By Kidnapping Doctor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mexican doctor accused in the
torture-slaying of an undercover U.S. drug agent must be returned
home because federal agents illegally ordered his kidnapping, a
judge ruled.
   The abduction soured diplomatic relations between the United
States and Mexico, which accused U.S. officials of encroaching on
Mexican sovereignty and threatened to cut off anti-drug cooperation.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was brought from Guadalajara to Los
Angeles in April to face prosecution in the 1985 death of Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ruled Friday the United
States violated its extradition treaty with Mexico when DEA
operatives kidnapped the doctor from his office at gunpoint.
   Rafeedie said the court lacked jurisdiction to try Alvarez. But
he stayed for one week his order that the doctor be returned when
Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fahey asked for time to consider an
appeal.
   Justice Department officials had no immediate comment on the
ruling.
   Rafeedie warned the DEA that such violations would not be
tolerated even if they are committed to curb international drug
trafficking.
   The judge said he was not dismissing any charges against
Alvarez, but ruled the case could not be tried in the United States.
   It was not clear what Alvarez' fate would be in Mexico, where he
currently faces no charges. The Mexican attorney general's office
has said it wants to question him about possible crimes.
   Alvarez was spirited out of Mexico by people paid by the DEA. In
the United States he faced charges he administered drugs to revive
Camarena for questioning while he was being tortured.
   ``The DEA gave the go-ahead for the abduction,'' Rafeedie said.
``This command was approved at the highest levels of the DEA. The
United States Attorney General's office was consulted.''
   He rejected a government contention that the DEA was not
responsible because its agents did not personally kidnap Alvarez.
   ``The United States is responsible for the actions of its paid
agents,'' the judge said.
   Alvarez' lawyer, Robert Steinberg, said he feared the ruling
would be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. ``My fear
is they're going to take these appeals for years while he (Alvarez)
rots in jail,'' he said.
   The Justice Department said earlier it was pressing its
investigation into the 1985 torture-murder of Camarena and his
pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. Four men were recently convicted,
three on charges of kidnapping Camarena and one on charges of
killing two American tourists mistaken for DEA agents.
   Three others were convicted in 1988 on charges of involvement in
the murder. More than two dozen people have been convicted in
Mexico.
   In another development in the Camarena case, Rafeedie ordered an
investigation into possible jury tampering during the most recent
trial.
   The action came after defense lawyer Martin Stolar refused to
answer Rafeedie's questions about whether he had social contacts
with a court stenographer during the trial.
   ``These are factors that create in the court's mind a cause to
inquire whether there has been any tampering with this jury and
whether there was an attempt to improperly use a member of the
court staff,'' Rafeedie said.
   Stolar, who represents reputed drug kingpin Juan Ramon Matta
Ballesteros, told the judge he had no communications with court
reporter Julie Churchill regarding jury deliberations but refused
to answer further questions about other discussions they may have
had.

<HEAD>Judges Agree on Plan to Consolidate Asbestos Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten federal judges brainstormed a plan to
consolidate tens of thousands of costly lawsuits aimed at the
makers of cancer-causing asbestos, a newspaper reported today.
   The agreement reached after an unusual private meeting in
Washington, D.C., on Friday was designed to speed up compensation
to more than 100,000 asbestos victims and distribute the
settlements more fairly, The New York Times reported.
   The plan, which must withstand likely legal challenges from both
sides, also would boost settlement money by reducing court costs
and legal fees. Some judges estimate that two-thirds of money that
could go to asbestos victims is eaten up during lengthy trials, the
report said.
   ``The need for a multicourt cooperative effort to dispose of
these cases is compelling,'' a four-page order arising from the
meeting said. ``The transaction costs are unacceptable. Thousands
of claimants die before they can get their cases resolved.
   ``Trials have become repetitive, with the same issues and the
same products being litigated time after time.''
   The compromise plan would separate primary duties between three
judges whose rulings have conflicted in the past.
   Judge Thomas D. Lambros of Cleveland would be assigned the task
of trying to settle as many cases as possible. Judge Robert M.
Parker of Tyler, Texas, would be primary trial judge. Judge Jack B.
Weinstein of New York would handle claims against six defendants
who don't have the money to make payments under existing settlement
plans.
   The order was issued by Lambros and Parker and approved by the
other eight judges. They are: Walter J. Gex III of Biloxi, Miss.;
Alan H. Nevas of Westport, Conn.; Richard A. Schell of Beaumont,
Texas; Charles Schwartz Jr. of New Orleans; Charles P. Sifton of
New York; Charles R. Wolle of Des Moines and Rya W. Zobel of Boston.
   Legal scholars said it was the first meeting of its kind in 28
years.
   Asbestos is a fire-proof insulation material widely used
throughout the United States until it was learned that too much
physical contact or inhaling asbestos fibers can cause cancer, even
years after exposure.
   Lambros and Parker would supervise the consolidation of two
nationwide class actions of at least 11,000 cases, and more cases
could be added later, the report said.
   As of Jan. 1, there were 29,466 cases filed in federal court.
Many of those involved multiple plaintiffs and defendants. An
estimated 60,000 are in state courts.
   A hearing by Lambros and Parker on the class actions will be
held Sept. 14 in Cleveland.

<HEAD>Chrysler Fined $7.6 Million for Odometer Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge fined Chrysler Corp. $7.6 million for
selling thousands of supposedly new cars to customers who were
unaware that company employees had already driven them with the
odometers disconnected.
   The criminal fine handed down Friday by U.S. District Judge John
Nangle is on top of an earlier settlement of $16.3 million in a
civil lawsuit.
   Chrysler had entered a plea of no contest to the criminal
charges in December 1987. The judge ordered Chrysler to pay
$500,000 on each of 15 fraud counts, and fined the company an
additional $100,000 on a conspiracy count.
   ``Over $7 million dollars is a substantial amount of money,''
said Chrysler spokesman James Kenyon. The company will decide soon
whether to appeal, he said.
   The cars were driven before sale as part of Chrysler's
quality-assurance program. After the charges were filed in June
1987, company Chairman Lee Iacocca apologized and said the
unhooking of odometers would stop.
   Nangle said the car-testing program had started out as a good
idea. But he said that the program had led to ``increasing abuses''
and that Chrysler had passed up chances in the 1980s to eliminate
them.
   Chrysler's attorneys had argued that federal law limited the
fine to a maximum of $1 million. Government prosecutors had
suggested Chrysler could be fined $120 million.
   Robert G. Morvillo, a Chrysler attorney from New York, said the
company had ``bent over backward'' to satisfy the affected
customers. The company still tests cars, he said, but leaves the
odometers connected and puts no more than 65 miles on the vehicles.
   ``Chrysler has done everything it can to make amends to its
customers and the general public,'' Morvillo said.
   Chrysler also was charged with selling about 30 previously
wrecked cars to consumers who thought the cars were factory-fresh.
   The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which had brought the
charges at the end of a four-year investigation, said that Chrysler
has replaced all vehicles identified as having been previously
wrecked, except for cars involved in ongoing court cases.
   There are about 46 individual civil lawsuits pending around the
country, Kenyon said.
   In January, Nangle ordered Chrysler to complete the terms of the
settlement of the class-action civil lawsuit by paying $500 each to
more than 27,000 people worldwide who had purchased Chrysler cars
with disconnected odometers that had been driven by company
executives.
   The consumers also are entitled to a second payment to be
determined after Nangle decides how much of the remaining $2.5
million from the $16.3 million settlement should go to plaintiffs'
attorneys.
   Records showed that the automaker disconnected the odometers on
about 60,000 new cars that were driven from one day to five weeks
by Chrysler executives.

<HEAD>Moderate Earthquake Shakes Ecuadorean Capital, Kills Four</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake has killed at least
four people in a village near the capital, damaged dozens of small
adobe homes and sent panicked residents rushing into the streets.
   The temblor at 10 p.m. Friday (11 p.m. EDT) lasted about 25
seconds, said Hugo Yepez, director of the Geodesic Institute.
   Bruce Presgrave, a spokesman for the National Earthquake
Information Center of the U.S. Geological Service in Golden, Colo.,
said the prelimimary Richter scale reading was 5.0.
   ``That would make it a moderate earthquake,'' he said.
   Presgrave said the epicenter was about 40 miles east of Quito.
Yepez put the epicenter at 14 miles north of the capital, near
Pomasqui and Calderoon, both poor farming villages.
   According to Quito's Radio Sucre, at least four people died,
including a small child, when their house was buried in a landslide
caused by the earthquake.
   One witness, Juan Molineros, said an ``undetermined number of
people were missing in a nearby quarry.''
   Dozens of adobe homes were damaged and walls collapsed in the
villages, the radio station said.
   Hundreds of people in the area were sleeping around fires
outside their homes, fearing further temblors, the radio said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable
damage.

   Imperialism attended to its interests in oil and secured
geographic positions on the coasts of seas, oceans, and gulfs, when
it established these dwarf oil states. It made sure they guaranteed
the major points by creating those states, kept away the riches
from the majority. ...

scourge of weakness and corruption, and the state of isolation
which kept Kuwait away from its kinfolk and origin in dear Iraq. ...
   Arabs, Moslems, believers in God wherever you are, this is your

O Moslems, O believers wherever you are. This is your day to rise
and spread quickly in order to defend Mecca, which is captive to
the spears of the Americans and the Zionists. ...
   Burn the soil under their feet. Burn the soil under the feet of
the aggressors and invaders who want harm for your families in
Iraq. Until the voice of right rises up in the Arab world, hit
their interests wherever they are and rescue holy Mecca and the
grave of the Prophet Mohammed in Medina. ...
   We shall be victorious, God willing, and evil and corruption
will be trampled wherever it is, the sun will rise on the Arabs and
the Moslems and God will be happy after we purify our souls and

   King Hussein is in a quandary over U.N. and
Arab League sanctions against neighboring Iraq, which invaded and
annexed tiny, oil-rich Kuwait more than a week ago.
   Jordan is a small, vulnerable kingdom surrounded by mighty
neighbors _ Israel to the west, Syria to the north and Iraq and
Saudi Arabia to the east.
   Hussein has said Jordan supports the U.N. economic blockade of
Baghdad designed to force an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, but on
Friday he did not vote for the Arab League resolution to send
troops to Saudi Arabia.
   Instead, the king expressed reservations about the measure and
took no position. And although he says he supports the U.N.
sanctions, he has not specifically agreed to apply them.
   Hussein forged a tight alliance with Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. A crucial overland
truck route from the Red Sea port of Aqaba was Iraq's weapons
lifeline.
   And the two nations formed a joint air force training squadron,
partly because Jordan's deteriorating economy could not afford to
go it alone.
   Imposing sanctions on Iraq would likely cause major problems for
Hussein among his people who appear overwhelmingly on the side of
Saddam.
   During demonstrations in support of Saddam Friday, the Moslem
Brotherhood, Jordan's most powerful political group, made clear it
would not tolerate economic sanctions against Baghdad.
   In southern Maan, demonstrators chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, savior
of the Arab nation,'' and said they would attack the U.S. Embassy
in Amman and U.S. interests elsewhere if American forces in Saudi
Arabia attack Iraq.
   Moslem religious leaders in Jordan have also picked up Saddam's
call Friday for Jihad, or holy war, against the United States in
response to Washington's troop deployment in the Middle East.
   By late Friday, more than 40,000 Jordanians had reportedly
volunteered to join a special unit to fight in Iraq if war breaks
out.
   At least half of Jordan's 3 million people fled Palestine during
Arab wars with Israel, and many welcome any move that threatens
Israel such as Saddam's warning that he will use chemical weapons
against the Jewish state.
   Hussein must perform a constant balancing act between
Palestinians and the more conservative native Jordanians.
   The king was clearly aware of pro-Saddam public feeling when he
said Wednesday his government ``was studying'' the sanctions issue.
   Asked whether he approved the dispatch of U.S. troops to the
gulf region, Hussein said: ``Saudi Arabia is a sovereign state that
can accept or seek any kind of assistance that it believes it needs.
   ``It is not for me to say whether this is right or not. Time
will tell whether it was, or otherwise,'' he said.
   Hussein did, however, reject Saddam's annexation of Kuwait and
said Jordan ``still recognizes the emirate regime in Kuwait.''
   Analysts said a mounting anti-American sentiment among
Jordanians and the pro-Saddam swing is mainly because of a
perceived double standard by Washington in dealing with the U.N.
resolutions.
   Arab critics have said the United States should not intervene to
protect Saudi Arabia because it has not moved to end the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized in
1967.
   But besides pressure from his own people against the imposition
of sanctions, Jordan's monarch is reportedly under enormous
pressure from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to adopt an unequivocal
anti-Saddam stance.
   A government official said on condition of anonymity that Fahd
has warned Hussein Saudi aid would be cut if the king did not fall
into line with other Arab states ready to impose sanctions against
Iraq.
   Jordan's economy would collapse without the substantial Saudi
financial aid it currently receives.

<HEAD>President Considering Plan For Mass Evacuation From Battle Zone</HEAD>

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa is
weighing a plan to evacuate 1 million Tamil civilians from the line
of fire before the army launches an assault on the rebel-held
Jaffna Peninsula in northern Sri Lanka.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told Parliament Friday
of a proposal to move civilians to temporary camps south of Jaffna,
``and then clear the north of these scum who call themselves
liberators of the Tamil people.''
   The Tamil Tiger rebels have held a 200-man army garrison under
siege in Jaffna since June 11, when they broke a 13-month-old
cease-fire and resumed a seven-year war for Tamil independence.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since the Tamil war
began, many of them civilians.
   Military officials said today that eight Tigers were killed a
day earlier in clashes with the army in the eastern and northern
regions of this Indian Ocean island. One soldier also died in a
rebel ambush.
   The officials said on condition of anonymity that police raided
a rebel hideout in eastern Sri Lanka and seized 17,000 rounds of
ammunition, and 200 hand grenades among other weapons.
   Wijeratne did not say when the evacuation might begin or how
many people would be moved. Government census figures show 1
million Tamils live on the peninsula, but thousands have fled
across the Palk Straits to southern India.
   ``The suggestion is before the President. We plan to get all
innocent Tamil civilians out of the Jaffna Peninsula and then throw
the Tamil terrorists into the salty waters of the Palk Straits,''
Wijeratne said.
   Government and military officials said privately it may take
some time for Premadasa to decide on the plan. ``This is no easy
task,'' said one senior military officer.
   The army has been poised to move into the peninsula since late
last month when it recaptured strategic villages around Elephant
Pass, which controls the only road across the narrow land link
between Jaffna and mainland Sri Lanka.
   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the population, started
fighting in 1983 for a homeland in the northern and eastern
provinces, where they are a majority.
   Tamils say they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and army. The remaining 7 percent are Moslems.

<HEAD>Tribal Taboos Hamper AIDS-Awareness Efforts on Indian Reservations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Age-old American Indian tribal customs are
hampering AIDS education efforts on reservations nationwide and
some Indians don't even accept the threat of what some call the
``white man's disease.''
   Cultural taboos prevent many Indians, especially the elderly,
from openly discussing sexually-related problems such as AIDS,
health workers say.
   Most Indian tribes don't even have a word for the disease. Women
at the Rocky Boys Reservation in north-central Montana are trying
to devise a word in the Chippewa-Cree language to convey the
meaning of ``acquired immune deficiency syndrome.''
   The number of AIDS cases among Indians appears small, with fewer
than 200 confirmed cases among America's 1.5 million Indians,
according to the National Native American AIDS Prevention Center in
Oakland, Calif.
   But some officials worry those numbers are lower than actual
infection figures because most Indians are not tested for AIDS.
   ``It's kind of scary,'' said Cecilia Limberhand of Lame Deer, a
tribal health worker on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in
southeastern Montana. ``The people here think it's not going to
come to us. They say, `That's a white man's disease, why should we
worry about it?'''
   Non-Indian health workers devising AIDS awareness programs often
alienate the people they're trying to help by using inappropriate
symbolism or failing to recognize subtle social hierarchies on the
reservation.
   In a poster created for the Crow Indian Reservation, a dark,
brooding image of an owl, an Indian burial platform and gravestones
embellish an AIDS warning. The images sent a shudder through Crow
tribe member Manuela Mesteth, an Indian Health Service worker who
screens such materials. She knew that in her culture the symbols
would repel before they had a chance to educate.
   ``Those posters and pamphlets, the Crows would be very much
afraid of,'' she said. ``They would never read those pamphlets and
would never look at the owl poster, and probably would not hang the
poster of the raised burial.''
   Tribal taboos also require that any discussion of sexuality be
conducted through rigidly defined family roles.
   ``We try to do surveys here, and (find that) certain people
cannot talk to other people,'' said Tennyson Doney, Indian Health
Service chief on the Crow reservation in southeastern Montana.
   ``A nephew cannot talk to his uncle about certain things, and an
uncle will not talk to his nephew about certain things,'' Doney
said. ``All your aunts are your mothers. ... Women start breaking
away from their fathers at a certain age, and it becomes more of a
formal relationship.
   ``You try to work in something like sex education in all that
and it can get very complex as to who does what,'' he said.
   Even Mesteth, who is 52 and has been a reservation health worker
for 29 years, is unsure how some relationships could affect
discussions on topics like AIDS and would defer to the advice of
tribal elders.
   ``If I have to give a speech about AIDS, the younger people
would listen better, but if I had a brother there, or an uncle,
they might leave the room because I'd be talking about sexuality,''
she said.
   Despite communication barriers, many reservation schools teach
about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
   Free condoms, provided discreetly in some reservation clinics
and in some schools, are credited with recent declines in teen-age
pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases on some reservations,
the health service said.
   Newspapers and television also help younger Indians to gain
information about AIDS, said Verbina Savior, a health worker on the
Fort Peck Reservation in northeastern Montana. But ``the older
group says AIDS is never coming here. They just won't accept it,''
she said.
   Tribal laws are often hard for non-Indians to recognize.
   ``It's nothing that would be apparent,'' said John Robinson, a
Northern Cheyenne who heads the Billings American Indian Council.
``That's why a lot of people go on a reservation and say there's no
culture left. They see Levis and boom boxes, when what they're
looking for is breechcloths and feathers.
   ``But the culture is what they can't see.''

<HEAD>Some Defense Firms Could Benefit From Iraqi Standoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Iraqi-American standoff is unlikely to
change an overall downward trend in defense spending, but certain
companies could benefit by arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other
countries, analysts said.
   The confrontation has accelerated prospects for an international
recession, but some opportunities also are unfolding, said Richard
Rosecrance, a political science professor at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   ``The net effect is probably going to be inflationary, whatever
the short-term effect may be,'' said Rosecrance, associate director
of the Center for International and Strategic Affairs.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has already cooled congressional ardor
to make aggressive defense spending reductions.
   ``It probably will mean the defense cuts will be a little bit
less than they otherwise would be,'' said Alexis Cain of the
private Defense Budget Project.
   The defense industry is one of the largest components of
California's $700 billion economy. Recent drives to cut defense
spending have yielded thousands of layoffs.
   Several defense industry executives declined to comment on the
impact Iraq's takeover could have on Southern California's
armaments industry.
   ``My guess is U.S. defense spending will continue to decline,''
said Lawrence Harris, a defense industry analyst for Bateman
Eichler Hill Richards, a Los Angeles brokerage firm.
   But Raytheon, General Dynamics Corp. and certain other U.S.
makers of missiles, tanks and war planes could gain new orders from
foreign countries, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Harris said
Friday.
   In particular, Raytheon has discussed sales of its new
ground-to-air missile, the Patriot, with both countries, said Dave
Harris, a spokesman for the Army Missile Command near Huntsville,
Ala.
   With Iraqi missiles poised on the Saudi border, the kingdom's
interest in acquiring the high-tech Patriot obviously would
intensify, analysts said.
   Patriot sales to the Saudis probably would require Congressional
approval, and ``as of right now, there is no pending sale,'' Dave
Harris said.
   General Dynamics announced last month that the Saudis agreed to
purchase 315 M-1 tanks, the Army's main battle tank, for $1.8
billion, with deliveries scheduled through the mid-1990s.
   The St. Louis-based manufacturer also signed a deal in 1988 to
produce 555 M-1 tanks for Egypt, with deliveries to be completed by
the year 2002.
   General Dynamics spokesman George Salamon said ``it's much too
early'' to say if the crisis might prompt the company to change its
plans to consolidate two divisions in Southern California,
eliminating as many as 2,000 jobs.
   Rosecrance said the crisis, by driving up oil prices and fueling
inflation, has accelerated prospects of a recession.
   ``The Persian Gulf is just the icing on the recessionary cake,''
he said.

   NATO military forces were on their way
to the Persian Gulf today and Arab countries said they were sending
troops to the region in reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, East Germany joined a widening world embargo of Iraq
and nations announced plans to evacuate their nationals from Iraq
and Kuwait.
   A squadron of British Jaguar attack jets left today to join
Britain's forces in the Middle East. Turkish newspapers reported
today that Turkey has moved warplanes and ground forces to its
southeast border with Iraq.
   Several more U.S. allies including Australia, Canada and West
Germany committed ships Friday to an international effort to
isolate Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed the
Persian Gulf nation.
   Iraq has been massing troops at Kuwait's southern border with
Saudi Arabia and Iraq's northern border with Turkey.
   The United States and Britain have already sent ships to the
gulf to pressure Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. France and the
Soviet Union sent ships to the gulf independent of the
multinational force.
   Speaking at a NATO meeting Friday, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III appealed to the Western alliance for support.
   ``We should show that we will do whatever must be done in order
to enforce the will of the United Nations,'' Baker said, referring
to a U.N. call to boycott Iraq.
   But Manfred Woerner, the NATO secretary-general, announced after
a four-hour closed meeting with Baker and 15 other Western foreign
ministers: ``Military action by NATO as such is restricted to its
area,'' meaning Europe.
   Despite the NATO decision, individual members promised to send
forces.
   Twelve British Jaguar attack jets, accompanied by tanker
aircraft, took off from Britain today for an undisclosed base in
the gulf region, the British Defense Ministry said in a statement.
About 250 ground personnel and support troops were expected to
follow.
   Over the weekend 12 Tornado F3 fighters are to leave Cyprus to
join up with U.S. aircraft in Saudi Arabia, the ministry said.
   The United States already has nine ships in the Persian Gulf,
seven in the Mediterranean, and aircraft carriers and their
battlegroups in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. U.S. personnel are
expected to reach 50,000 over the next weeks.
   The NATO foreign ministers pledged to defend Turkey if the
country is attacked by neighboring Iraq. Turkey on Thursday gave
permission for U.S. forces to launch attacks from Turkish bases
against Iraq in the event of war.
   Today the Istanbul daily Cumhuriyet said two squadrons of
Turkish F-16s and four more brigades were moved to southeastern
Turkey. According to the paper, land forces near Turkey's 185-mile
border with Iraq were in a state of readiness.
   Tension between the two countries is high because Turkey imposed
tough economic sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait,
including closing down two Iraqi oil pipelines.
   The Arab League voted Friday to send forces to Saudi Arabia to
protect the gulf state from Iraqi forces, massed along the
Saudi-Kuwait border.
   Twelve members of the 21-member league, meeting in Cairo, Egypt,
approved the measure and also voted to join a U.N.-backed boycott
of Iraq.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said today that he is sending
troops to the region. Arab diplomatic sources said Syrian and
Moroccan troops also were expected to be part of the force.
   East Germany, despite its tough transition from communism to
capitalism, said it was complying with U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
East Berlin had exported electronics, agricultural machinery,
industrial equipment and some chemical products to Iraq.
   Some countries announced plans to evacuate their citizens from
Kuwait and Iraq. Iraq has closed its borders, effectively trapping
about 3,500 Americans living in the two countries.
   The South Korean government decided today to fly all 1,260 of
their nationals and expected permission from Iraq, officials said
in Seoul. Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral was quoted
today as saying the government was waiting for permission from
Iraqi authorities to allow the evacuation of its 170,000 citizens.
   In other developments:
   _ About 30 drunken Finnish youths stoned the Iraqi Embassy in
Helsinki late Friday night, police said. Eight were arrested.
   _ The head of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, warned
Friday that trying to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait through
military means may escalate the crisis, Tehran radio reported.
   _ A French survey of 800 people this week by the IPSOS polling
company found 47 percent were in favor of French participation in a
multinational force if war breaks out, while 43 percent were
opposed.
   The poll, conducted for the weekly magazine Le Point, said 46
percent hoped U.S. forces would confront Iraq directly, while 34
percent hoped this would not happen. No margin of error was given.
   _ In Jerusalem, travel agents said Friday they received
cancellations and were being swamped by phone calls from anxious
tourists worried about an Iraqi chemical attack on Israel.

<HEAD>Japan Began Reducing Oil Dependence Before Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By S.L. BACHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's long-term energy outlook isn't likely to
change despite the rise in oil prices, because the country has
slashed oil consumption through conservation and development of
other energy sources, analysts say.
   Japan announced a week ago it was joining an international
embargo on oil imported from Iraq and Kuwait to pressure Baghdad to
withdraw from the oil-rich gulf nation it invaded Aug. 2. Oil
prices shot up after Iraq's attack.
   The higher prices should have taken a harsh toll on Japan, which
imports 99.8 percent of its oil and depends on it for 57 percent of
its energy needs, according to the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry.
   But since the ``oil shock'' of the early 1970s, when oil prices
soared, Japan has been steadily moving away from oil toward greater
reliance on nuclear power. Conservation efforts also have played
their part in reducing dependence.
   While the nation never will be totally independent of imported
oil, government planners say they hope Japan eventually will need
oil for less than half its energy needs.
   Oil dependence has grown slightly since bottoming out at 56.3
percent five years ago. But consumption still represents a big
shift from 1973, when oil supplied 77 percent of Japan's energy.
   Coal accounts for 18 percent of Japan's energy, liquid natural
gas and nuclear energy nearly 10 percent each, hydroelectric power
about 1 percent, and other sources just over 1 percent, according
to ministry data.
   And since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the government has called
for further conservation measures to reduce Japan's dependence on
oil.
   The Advisory Committee for Energy, which advises the trade and
industry ministry, wants to cut oil dependence by another 10
percentage points over the next 20 years.
   Most of that would come from nearly doubling nuclear power
production. In a June report, the committee said that would mean
building 40 new nuclear power plants in addition to the 37 active
plants and 12 under construction.
   ``The Iraq-Kuwait situation is still only a short-term problem,
so we aren't thinking of changing the long-term plan,'' said a
ministry official on condition of anonymity. ``But if it became a
long-term problem, our assumptions would change. Then we would
think about changing the plan.''
   In the 1970s conservation helped ease the burden. The brilliant
lights of the Ginza _ a fancy shopping and entertainment district _
dimmed and television stations cut their broadcast hours.
   Industrial energy conservation was particularly significant for
the economy, said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an economist with Salomon
Brothers Asia Ltd.
   ``Relatively speaking, Japan sharply boosted its energy
efficiency,'' he said.
   A recent Salomon report said Japan is now the most
energy-efficient of the developed nations. The United States uses
2.5 times the commercial energy per person Japan uses and West
Germany uses 1.5 times more, the report said.
   Schoenholtz said Japan's energy efficiency will help the economy
absorb the higher oil prices with relative ease in the short term.
   However, energy conservation has lapsed over the last few years,
lulled by lower oil prices and the comforts of affluence, according
to the ministry.
   There is a need for a resurgence of conservation, an initiative
that would please environmentalists and power companies as well as
the government.
   The government long ago joined private environmentalists in
calling for conservation measures to reduce emissions of polluting
gases such as carbon dioxide, blamed in part for global warming.
   In addition, power companies face an enormous growth in demand,
according to the Institute of Energy Economics. For the first time
since 1983, last year's 6.8 percent growth in energy use surpassed
the growth in gross national product.
   The booming economy and increasing numbers of air conditioned
offices are largely to blame, said Tomoyuki Takao, a planner for
Tokyo Electric Power Co.
   The company, which produces a third of Japan's energy, is
scrambling to keep up with record demand, which on July 19 peaked
only 2 percent below the company's current generating capacity.
   Added generating capacity will help meet demand next year, but
meeting future needs will depend on the company's ability to
encourage conservation, Takao said.

<TEXT>
   Rebels are advancing on the capital
in an attempt to depose President Samuel Doe before a five-nation
West African peace-keeping force arrives to impose a cease-fire and
set up elections.
   The peacekeepers planned to sail into Monrovia from neighboring
Sierra Leone, but no date for their arrival has been announced.
Nigerian troops, more than half the force, were expected to leave
for Sierra Leone today.
   On Friday, rocket and small arms fire shook the capital in the
rebels advance, while fighting also reported between the two main
insurgent leaders.
   Plumes of black smoke from artillery rose over the city. Gunfire
crackled on both sides of Tubman Boulevard, the main road leading
into the beseiged capital from the Congo Town suburb.
   It was not clear who was responsible for the firing.
   Thousands of people, meanwhile, fled fighting in Paynesville, a
densely populated suburb six miles east of downtown Monrovia.
Rebels also were battling Doe's soldiers at Scheffelin army
barracks, about 15 miles east of the capital.
   Rebels loyal to Charles Taylor began their push into Monrovia on
Wednesday night. Meanwhile, foreign journalists in Liberia said
rebels of rival guerrilla leader Prince Johnson were fortifying
positions near Doe's executive mansion.
   Johnson said his men narrowly missed assassinating Doe on
Thursday when they ambushed his car less than a mile from the
mansion, the report said.
   ``I saw Doe with my own eyes,'' said a rebel who gave his name
as Battlefield. He said he fired at Doe's blue Peugeot near the
Defense Ministry.
   The rebels have demanded Doe resign, but the Liberian leader has
refused to step aside. The capital has been under seige for weeks
and many of its residents have fled the fighting and shortages of
food and water.
   Johnson also was quoted as saying his men had beaten back an
attack by 100 Taylor rebels on his rear flank near Monrovia Free
Port.
   ``If Taylor brings 50 million men, I don't care,'' Johnson said.
``If they are not tactically trained, they run away.''
   Taylor, whose 10,000 fighters represent the largest army in the
country, is opposed to intervention by the West African force.
Taylor was believed concerned because about 1,000 of the soldiers
were coming from Nigeria. Nigeria's leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida,
has been a staunch Doe ally.
   Doe and Johnson have welcomed West African intervention in the
7-month-old war that has left 5,000 people dead, mainly civilians
slaughtered for their tribal affiliations. The war began in
December when Taylor's forces invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast,
accusing Doe of corruption and mismanagement.
   In Lagos, the Nigerian capital, Babangida said Friday the
peacekeepers were ready to fight to impose a cease-fire in Liberia.
``We cannot be deterred by these actions of the warring groups,''
he told reporters.

   California firefighters face a long, hot weekend with multiple
wildfires that charred more than 150,000 acres of timber and closed
Yosemite National Park, while other Western states battled
persistent blazes of their own.
   Idaho, Washington and Oregon were other targets of electrical
storms that brought a week of fire-sparking lightning bolts to the
Pacific Northwest.
   Fifteen major fires raged in California today, combined with
hundreds of smaller blazes. Seventy-two buildings were burned
several areas were evacuated.
   A National Guard helicopter crashed Friday while lifting water
from a pond. One crew member suffered minor injuries and two others
aboard escaped without injury, officials said.
   The helicopter crew was working to douse the Pine Creek fire,
which has charred 70,000 acres of forest. It was among the largest
of the blazes plaguing drought-stricken California, where more than
21,000 lightning strikes hit last week.
   More thunderstorms were predicted this weekend, along with hot
temperatures and high winds, said National Weather Service
meteorologist Gary Lipari.
   Fires near Yosemite closed the park and burned 12,000 acres of
forest, charring 66 structures and 14 vehicles. Rangers sent 10,000
park visitors packing.
   Other large blazes roared at the Lassen County town of Ravendale
and in Tehama County and Sequoia National Park.
   Firefighters were spread so thin that only an 18-person crew was
fighting a 2,500-acre wildfire in the King Mountain Range, a
federal wilderness area on the north coast that includes habitat of
the endangered spotted owl.
   Wind-driven flames racing through dry brush and trees made
firefighting dangerous. Two crews were overrun, one in Yosemite and
another in Sequoia National Forest, but the firefighters escaped
serious injury by scrambling into heat-resistant tents.
   A reinforced army of 8,000 federal and state firefighters isn't
enough, officials said. The U.S. Forest Service late Friday asked
the military for 1,000 servicemen to join firefighting forces.
   In Washington and Oregon, firefighters mopped up older,
dwindling fires as new, lightning sparked blazed cropped up. Most
were small, measuring less than an acre late Friday.
   In Idaho, crews got a reprieve from five days of triple-digit
temperatures as they battled three huge range fires in the southern
part of the state, including the 66,000-acre Thorn Creek blaze.
   Humid air Friday and cooler temperatures helped turn a raging
monster into a slow-moving snake that blackened sagebrush and grass
along an 18-mile swath.
   Farther south, a 12,000-acre blaze burned toward a fire line,
pushed by winds gusting to 50 mph, said Sawtooth National Forest
spokesman El Waldapfel.
   To the north, hundreds of firefighters were scattered through
national forests where more than 60 fires burned after three
straight days of lightning. ``Our problems are like everybody
else's _ limited resources,'' said Salmon National Forest spokesman
Tom Patten.

   A bomb exploded outside a
fast-food restaurant opposite a black-run taxi stand today,
injuring 12 people, a news agency and hospital officials reported.
   Police confirmed the explosion in the predominately black
shopping area in Pretoria, the independent South African Press
Association reported.
   Twelve people, including eleven blacks were injured in the
blast, a hospital official said. Two of the wounded were in serious
condition, said Margaret Kelly, Medical Superintendent for Kalafong
Hospital, near Pretoria.
   The independent Radio 702 reported that police defused a second
explosive device found in a garbage can at the taxi stand.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. The explosion
follows a series of bombings against black targets by extreme
right-wing white groups.
   Right-wing whites are outraged at President F.W. de Klerk's
stated plans to end apartheid and share power with the nation's 30
million blacks.

   Taking precautions against a possible
Iraqi attack, the Turkish military has moved F-16s and other
warplanes to bases near the Iraqi border, newspapers reported today.
   Iraq, meanwhile, accused Turkish planes of violating its
airspace and lodged a protest with the Turkish ambassador in
Baghdad.
   The Iraqi news agency said two unidentified Turkish aircraft
crossed into Iraqi airspace on Thursday and another plane did so on
Friday.
   ``We are studying the Iraqi allegations,'' Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Murat Sungar said today.
   Tension between the two countries is high because Turkey imposed
tough economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions, in line with those ordered by the U.N. Security Council,
include effectively closing down of two pipelines carrying Iraqi
oil.
   The Istanbul daily Cumhuriyet said two squadrons of F-16s were
flown from the Murted airbase near this capital city to the
Diyarbakir base in southeastern Turkey. Older F-4 and F-104 jets
were moved to Batman airbase, south of Diyarbakir, from the Black
Sea coast area, the report said.
   According to the paper, land forces near Turkey's 185-mile
southern border with Iraq were in a state of readiness.
   These include an armored brigade in Diyarbakir and three other
brigades in the provinces of Siirt, Sanliurfa and Gaziantep, the
report said.
   Defense Minister Safa Giray said the land forces were on routine
exercises. ``It has nothing to do with the gulf crisis,'' he told
Anatolia news agency.
   The daily Hurriyet reported that West Germany has started
shipping Leopard tanks to Turkey, with a consignment arriving by
ship Friday at the Derince port on the Marmara Sea.
   The paper also said that U.S. F-111 warplanes at the NATO base
at Incirlik had been equipped with bombs. A spokeswoman at the
base, Sgt. Marty Davis, said the planes are routinely equipped with
bombs for training exercises. She said about 14 F-111s were
currently deployed at the base for training.
   The Turkish general staff refuses to give information on
specific military moves. But it confirmed Thursday evening that
some Turkish air force units were in a ``state of advanced
readiness.''
   A Western diplomatic source said Turkey is taking defensive
action, ``doing what any prudent military would do in times of high
tension.''
   Turkish President Turgut Ozal told The Associated Press in an
interview Friday that Turkey was on guard against possible Iraqi
aggression but that he did not expect Iraq to attack this
NATO-member nation.
   Foreign ministers of NATO pledged in Brussels on Friday to come
to Turkey's defense in case of an attack.
   ``It is clear that an attack on Turkey would be considered an
attack on all (NATO) nations,'' NATO Sceretary General Manfred
Woerner told reporters.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has extended by two
months his decree for militant groups to disarm and disband, Tass
reported today.
   The extension of the decree, which had expired Thursday, was a
response to requests from the republics, the official news agency
said.
   Interior Minister Vladimir Bakatin suggested last week after
meeting with the new president of Armenia, Levon Ter-Petrosyan,
that the deadline be extended. Ter-Petrosyan said Armenian forces _
not Soviet army or Interior Ministry troops _ would then ensure
that all illegal weapons in the republic were confiscated.
   Gorbachev's July 26 decree was an attempt to quell ethnic
violence in the Soviet Union. It was aimed chiefly at Armenia,
which is locked in a bitter border dispute with neighboring
Azerbaijan.
   Estimates of membership in Armenian militant organizations has
ranged from 40,000 to as high as 160,000, but the Armenian
president said it was no higher than 5,000.
   Bakatin said about 1,600 firearms and more than 100,000 rounds
of ammunition were voluntarily turned in or confiscated under the
decree.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said there were 6,700
stolen firearms in Armenia alone, including 1,200 submachine guns.

<HEAD>New President To Revamp Colombia's Justice System To Fight
Terrorism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New President Cesar Gaviria is about to
unveil a comprehensive plan to shore up Colombia's court system so
drug terrorists can be brought to justice, Gavria's judicial
adviser said.
   Adviser Fernando Carrillo said on Friday the plan includes
creating special ``fortress cities'' where judges investigating
drug cases could live with their families, free of intimidation by
terrorists.
   He told The Associated Press in an interview that the new system
would restructure the entire Justice Department and originate a new
100-member elite corps within the judicial police.
   Carrillo said a specialized court system would be created
specifically to try cases involving drug trafficking and terrorism.
   Gaviria was inaugurated Tuesday. He has said revamping the
justice system will be a major priority of his administration.
   ``Violence in Colombia is largely due to the weakness of our
justice system,'' Gaviria told foreign reporters Thursday.
   In the past, judges refusing to take drug traffickers' bribes
faced being murdered. Because of the intimidation, Colombia has
been unable to keep any major drug kingpin in jail.
   The president said at his inauguration that Colombia ``cannot
keep allowing our judges to be defenseless at the mercy of the
criminal organizations.''
   Carrillo said a system of ``faceless judges'' would be
established, whereby judicial officials investigating drug cases
could remain anonymous.
   He said pools of judges would be created in which various judges
would try cases together.
   ``In this way, criminals could not identify which individual
judge tried which case,'' Carrillo said.
   He said the government's new plan envisions upgrading
evidence-gathering technology, better security for judges and
hiring specialized prosecutors.
   The new justice minister, Jaime Giraldo, told reporters on
Thursday that ``fortifying'' the courts would enable accused drug
criminals to be tried in Colombia, instead of extraditing them to
the United States.
   He said extradition should be employed only in special cases.
   Many Colombians believe sending citizens to be tried in a
foreign country is an insult to national pride.

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Officer Says He's Organizing Resistance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An officer in the disbanded Kuwaiti army says he
is helping to organize armed guerrilla units within Kuwait to fight
the Iraqi occupation.
   He spoke in a telephone interview Friday with Sky News from
somewhere on the Kuwaiti border with Saudi Arabia. He was
identified only as a major who had just arrived from Kuwait city.
   The officer didn't say how many fellow officers had gone
underground but said many of his military classmates were still in
Kuwait and others who had been abroad joined the resistance.
   Estimates put the strength of the Iraqi army at 1 million
soldiers. The Kuwait army, now disbanded, had 20,300 soldiers.
   He said that after the invasion on Aug. 2, the Iraqis rounded up
thousands of Kuwaitis, ``seizing ... whatever they had ... and
taking them to Basra,'' an Iraqi city just north of the Kuwaiti
border.
   A day or two after that, he said, ``They started taking Western
hostages ... and they are being used now either to ward off an
attack on Iraqi targets or to be used to blackmail the West.''
   President Bush on Friday expressed concern about the 3,500
Americans detained in Iraq and Kuwait, as well as the ``very
disturbing reports of violence against the citizens of several
countries.'' But he and other officials in Washington have
carefully avoided calling them hostages.
   Asked about looting, the officer said, Iraqi occupiers seized
``almost everything of value,'' put it on trucks and took it to
Baghdad.
   ``And there is the unofficial looting ... conducted by the Iraqi
soldiers themselves ... holding people at gunpoint and seizing
whatever they have have in their possession _ watches, jewelry and
money. Recently, they have been entering homes and doing so.''

   At least 11 Americans _ including a California girl trapped
while traveling alone in the Persian Gulf region _ made their way
into Jordan today, and the first Arab troops reportedly landed in
Saudi Arabia to deter Iraqi aggression.
   Iraq has detained thousands of U.S. citizens and other
foreigners who were caught by the lightning invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Diplomatic sources said Egyptian and Moroccan troops arrived
today at Hafr al-Baten, the same northestern Saudi base where
thousands of U.S. troops had already landed. They said Egypt and
Morocco were each expected to provide at least 5,000 troops.
   But the Arab troops were traveling under the flags of their
respective countries because only a dozen of the Arab League's 21
member nations decided to participate in the deployment, rather
than sending a pan-Arab force.
   The Arab leaders agreed Friday to dispatch a defensive force
after Iraq's President Saddam Hussein refused to end his occupation
of Kuwait and made new threats against Western powers protecting
Saudi Arabia and Arab nations helping them.
   Tensions were running high in countries bordering Iraq.
   Turkish newspapers reported today that the Turkish military
moved F-16 fighter jets and other warplanes to the southeast, near
the border with Iraq, and the semi-official Anatolia news agency
said Iraq had moved anti-aircraft weaponry into place on its side
of the frontier.
   Turkey's NATO allies promised it protection after Ankara imposed
economic sanctions on Iraq, including the virtual shutdown of an
oil pipeline that pumps Iraqi oil through Turkey.
   In Iraq's neighbor Jordan, border officials said the group of
Americans, including Penelope Nabokov of Albany, Calif., crossed
the Iraqi-Jordanian frontier after a 660-mile overland journey from
the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.
   The girl had been flying unaccompanied from France to India when
she was taken into custody by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait during a
stopover there at the time of the Iraqi invasion last week. She was
later brought to Baghdad along with other Americans caught in
Kuwait by the invasion.
   The Americans who crossed into Jordan today included
non-essential U.S. Embassy staff and dependents, border officials
said. The size of the group was not immediately clear. Jordanian
border officials said the group totaled 12; the State Department
said it was 11, including Penelope.
   The department said the girl was being taken separately to Amman
by a U.S. government employee.
   Britain's Foreign Office said today that 21 British citizens
escaped from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. It said they had contacted
British embassies in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, but did not say how
they had gotten out of the emirate.
   President Bush on Friday expressed concern about the 3,500
Americans detained in Iraq and Kuwait, as well as the ``very
disturbing reports of violence against the citizens of several
countries.''
   U.S. forces today continued to converge on the desert kingdom of
Saudi Arabia, a day after European powers agreed to bolster the
U.S. flotilla in the Persian Gulf.
   The multinational force was deployed to protect Saudi Arabia,
the world's biggest oil exporter, after Iraqi forces massed over
the northern border in Kuwait.
   The troop deployment set off another demonstration today in
Yemen. Thousands of people rallied in front of the the American,
Saudi Arabian and Egyptian embassies in the Yemeni capital, San`a,
in support of Saddam.
   In the Israeli-occupied territories, hundreds of Palestinians
marched in support of Iraq today, shouting ``We are with you,
Saddam!'' Arab reporters said.
   Baghdad Radio today accused some Arab League countries of
deciding to send troops into Saudi Arabia because they were more
interested in doing what the United States asked than finding a
reconciliation formula.
   At their meeting Friday in Cairo, Egypt, 12 Arab leaders decided
to honor the worldwide U.N. trade embargo on Iraq. But eight of the
20 Arab League members present did not support the anti-Iraq moves.
   Jordan's government was among the eight Arab League states at
Friday's summit that did not vote for the measures against Iraq.
Egyptian officials said the plans would be binding only on the 12
nations that voted ``yes.''
   Iraq's government-run Al Joumhuriya newspaper, quoted by Radio
Monte Carlo, today said Saudi Arabia ``takes full responsibility
for any attack against Iraq because it invited foreign forces, most
of them American, into its lands.''
   Saddam on Friday urged Arabs to overthrow the region's ``oil
emirs,'' drive U.S. soldiers from Saudi Arabia, and ``burn the soil
under their feet.''
   President Bush on Friday dismissed his Sadddam's statements as
``a rather frantic ploy'' by a leader ``backed into a corner.''
   He indicated the United States is ready to impose a naval
blockade on Iraq if it tries to evade an international embargo by
shipping oil abroad. ``I would advise Iraqi ships not to go out
with oil,'' he said.
   An effective blockade could strangle the Iraqi economy with its
heavy dependence on oil exports, most or all of which already have
stopped.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, at NATO headquarters
in Belgium on Friday, won new backing from U.S. allies for the
Mideast military operation.
   Canada said it would send three ships, France was preparing to
expand its force to seven ships, and Australia said it would send
naval units. The British and Soviets also have a handful of
warships in or near the gulf.
   The Western forces were sent to coordinate with a growing U.S.
Navy armada soon expected to impose an economic blockade on Iraq.
Washington has dozens of warships, led by three aircraft carriers,
in the area.
   The Iraqis say their lightning conquest of Kuwait was aimed at
redressing grievances old and new. The Kuwaitis' recent
overproduction of oil had deflated world prices and Iraq's oil
revenues, they complained. Iraq also owed Kuwait $15 billion of its
$70 billion foreign debt.
   Baghdad reasserted old territorial claims over Kuwait and on
Wednesday annexed the country. Kuwait's leader, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, fled to Saudi Arabia the day of the invasion.
   Iraq's moves have drawn worldwide condemnation. The U.N.
Security Council ordered a global economic embargo.
   Up to 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to pour into Saudi Arabia
in the coming weeks. Pentagon sources say contingency plans call
for as many as 250,000 to be sent eventually, depending on whether
a grave Iraqi threat develops.
   At least 2,300 paratroopers landed in Saudi Arabia as the
deployment's first wave. The Air Force was deploying about 140
F-15s, F-16s and other warplanes. The Pentagon said Friday that a
pool of journalists was to be sent over the weekend to cover the
deployment.
   Many of the U.S. troops were taking up positions in Saudi
Arabia's far northeast, near the Kuwait border, facing an Iraqi
occupation force in Kuwait of between 130,000 and 170,000 men.

   The outcome of Mayor Marion Barry's drug and
perjury trial was big enough news in the nation's capital that it
prompted one of the city's two daily newspapers to publish its
second-ever extra edition.
   Today's Washington Times extra also was the 8-year-old
newspaper's first weekend edition. The Times is usually published
Monday through Friday, while the more widely distributed Washington
Post is printed seven days a week.
   Barry was convicted Friday of a single cocaine possession
offense after a 10-week trial that featured a video tape showing
the mayor smoking crack cocaine during an FBI sting operation.
   Barry and his supporters appeared jubilant after the
announcement in U.S. District Court of his acquittal on one count
and mistrial on a dozen other charges.
   Linda Clark, spokeswoman for The Times, said today's newspaper
was being sold in downtown Washington and in newsstands and racks
on the street. She said the paper also was being distributed in
some suburban areas.
   The Times published its first extra edition after Barry's arrest.

   At least 11 Americans, including a
10-year-old California girl who had been trapped in Kuwait while
traveling alone, crossed into Jordan today after a 660-mile
overland journey from the Iraqi capital.
   The girl, Penelope Nabokov of Albany, Calif., had been flying
unaccompanied from France to India when she was taken into custody
by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait during a stopover there at the time of
the Iraqi invasion last week. She was later transferred to Baghdad
with some of the passengers from the plane.
   Peter Nabokov, the girl's father, said in a telephone interview
from his home in California, ``My daughter is out. I have to keep
the line open.'' He said he would make a statement later, then hung
up.
   In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Martin Quinn,
confirmed that the party had crossed into Jordan and that it
included Penelope Nabokov and dependents of U.S. Embassy personnel.
   The State Department said the group totaled 11, including
Penelope; Jordanian border officials said 12 Americans had crossed
the border.
   Five West Germans also arrived at the Jordanian border today,
security officials said, but their identities were not immediately
known.
   Also today, Britain's Foreign Office said 21 British citizens
have escaped from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Seven contacted the
embassy in Bahrain and 14 contacted the embassy in Saudi Arabia
after crossing the border Friday night, said a Foreign Office
spokesman. He had no details on how they had escaped.
   Thousands of U.S. citizens have been trapped in Kuwait and Iraq
since the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on Aug. 2.
   The group that crossed the border today included U.S. Embassy
staffers and dependents, Jordanian border security officials said.
   An AP photographer reported from the Jordanian border post at
Ruweishid that 11 Americans and five West Germans arrived at the
frontier by bus at midafternoon. He said Jordanian border officials
confirmed the Americans were diplomatic staff and families.
   Jonathan Owens, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Amman,
confirmed that a group of Americans had left Baghdad earlier today.
Owens said he did not know how many were in the group.
   A number of non-essential U.S. Embassy staff and their
dependents had been expected to cross into Jordan. They were
delayed by an Iraqi decision Thursday to close the border except
for Arab nationals.
   Owens had said earlier that some diplomatic staff were trying to
cross the Iraqi border into Jordan, but were blocked by Iraqi
authorities ``for technical reasons.'' He did not elaborate.
   The American Embassy in Jordan has been sending cars and buses
daily to the Jordanian border to pick up any American citizens
leaving Iraq.
   Owens said the diplomatic staff and dependents were only passing
through the Jordanian capital and would be traveling on to
``another point soon.''
   Once through the Jordanian border post, the Americans headed for
Amman, 210 miles to the southwest across the Jordanian desert.
   President Bush on Friday expressed concern about the 3,500
Americans detained in Iraq and Kuwait, as well as the ``very
disturbing reports of violence against the citizens of several
countries.''
   But he stopped short of calling the Americans hostages.

   Flooding in 24 of China's 29 provinces has killed
more than 2,000 people this year and caused $2.5 billion in damage,
an official report said Saturday.
   The provinces hardest hit were Sichuan, in the southwest,
Jiangsu and Shandong, on the coast, and Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi and
Shanxi in central China, the China Daily reported.
   By the end of July, 21.4 million acres of farmland had been
flooded, and crop output is expected to drop by 30 percent on half
that area, it said. More than 740,000 buildings have collapsed.
   The total economic loss has been put at $2.5 billion, the paper
said.
   The Ministry of Water Resources said the peak of China's annual
summer flood season passed Friday. It described the nation's major
rivers as ``relatively stable.''
   Last year, nearly 3,000 people lost their lives in flooding.

   About 100 rebels ambushed an army
patrol in the southern Philippines, killing seven soldiers and
wounding four, the military reported Saturday.
   Area commander Brig. Gen. Antonio Nale said the incident took
place Friday in the town of Kapatagan, about 500 miles south of
Manila.
   He said a platoon of soldiers from the Army's 30th Infantry
Battalion were patrolling the area when a group of rebels opened
fire on the troops. Nale said he suspected that the rebels were
with the Marxist New People's Army.
   He said six soldiers were immediately killed and five were
wounded in a two-hour gunbattle with the rebels. One of the wounded
later died, Nale added.
   He said there were no reports of casualties on the rebel side
but pursuing troops reported bloodstains on the route taken by the
escaping guerrillas.
   The New People's Army has been waging a 21-year-old Marxist
insurgency.

   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police today dispersed thousands of people
who staged pro-Iraqi protests in front of several embassies and
smashed the windows of the U.S. mission, witnesses said.
   Witnesses said the demonstrators chanted slogans denouncing the
buildup of Arab and Western forces in Saudi Arabia. The troops were
deployed to protect the oil-rich desert kingdom after Iraq's
takeover of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Thousands of protesters rallied in front of the American, Saudi
Arabian, Egyptian, British and French embassies, the witnesses
said. Official sources said the embassies were cordoned off to
protect them.
   The demonstrations ended by afternoon, the officials said.
Similar demonstrations were staged Thursday and Friday.

<TEXT>
   The former Communist Party boss of
Prague will not be prosecuted for ordering the police crackdown on
demonstrators that sparked last year's democratic revolution, the
state news agency said Saturday.
   The CTK news agency, citing a statement by the general
prosecutor's office, said a police investigation proved that
Miroslav Stepan ordered police to break up the Nov. 17
demonstration by ``any means possible.''
   But an amendment to the penal code introduced last month stated
that ``only a person preparing an especially serious criminal act,
whose nature is expressly stipulated by law, can be guilty of
preparing a criminal act.'' Stepan's crime was not of this nature,
the report said. It did not elaborate.
   Stepan, who is the first member of the ousted Communist
leadership to have been placed on trial, was sentenced on July 9 to
four years in jail for abuse of power.
   The bloody police intervention of the Nov. 17 pro-reform rally
by 30,000 people unleashed huge protests and helped spawn the
opposition movement.
   The public's angry reaction and other demonstrations that month
culminated in the fall of more than four decades Communist rule in
Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Questions Linger on Fifth Anniversary of Worst Single-Plane Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuniko Miyajima says she still cannot accept the
death of her 9-year-old son because the full cause of the plane
crash that killed him five years ago has not been established.
   ``I know I can't get my son back, but at least, I have to be
convinced his death was not merely a waste of life,'' she said at
her home in Tokyo. ``The only way to ease my son's soul is to make
sure another accident with the same cause will not happen.''
   A Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 crashed into a mountain on a
domestic flight Aug. 12, 1985, killing all but four of 524 people
aboard.
   Mrs. Miyajima's son was traveling alone. It was the first time
she had sent him on a flight by himself.
   The families want a criminal trial in order to determine the
cause of the worst single-plane crash in aviation history, but are
stymied by differences between the U.S. and Japanese legal systems.
   Japan is one of the few countries that allows criminal charges
of professional negligence in such a case. In the United States,
liability usually is determined by a civil court.
   In 1988, Japanese police said they had found professional
negligence by two engineers at the Boeing Co., the Seattle-based
airplane manufacturer, and two Japan Air Lines maintenance men.
Last month, Japanese prosecutors said they would not conduct a
criminal investigation, citing a lack of evidence.
   On Sunday, the anniversary of the crash, the five-year statute
of limitations on professional negligence prosecution expires.
   Aviation and legal experts criticized the decision to drop the
case. They say prosecutors missed a chance to resolve questions
about the crash.
   ``Japan does not have the kind of system competent to conduct
adequate probes of airplane accidents _ unlike the United States _
without making them into a criminal case,'' said Kazuyuki Azusawa,
a lawyer for the relatives.
   ``The real cause of the JAL accident can only be made known to
the public through criminal court procedures. We are afraid the
prosecutors' irresponsible decision has sealed the case ...
forever.''
   Less than a month after the crash, Boeing conceded the direct
cause was faulty repairs by the company's engineers after a
previous minor accident.
   An investigation by the Japanese Transport Ministry also
confirmed an improper repair of the rear pressure bulkhead, which
was damaged in 1978 when the plane skidded on its tail while
landing at the Osaka Airport.
   Bulkheads, made of thin elastic metal, are designed to help
maintain the air pressure inside the cabin.
   Metal fatigue made cracks on the bulkhead, which ruptured during
the flight from Tokyo to Osaka, blasting away half the vertical
fin, knocking out the entire hydraulic system and making the plane
impossible to control, according to the Transport Ministry
investigation.
   The plane careened around Mount Fuji for 32 minutes and crashed
into a nearby mountain. Notes written by passengers describing the
terror of the last half hour were found at the crash site.
   ``Even if the faulty repair was really the cause of the
accident, as they say, we still don't know how it happened or who
did it, either,'' Azusawa said. ``We also need to look into the
possibility of inadequate inspection by JAL, which could not spot
the crack on the bulkhead as well.''
   The relatives' campaign, which appeared to be fading, was
revived last month when it was learned prosecutors had said the
faulty repair may not have been the only cause.
   Chief prosecutor Yusuke Yamaguchi of the Maebashi district,
which is handling the case, told representatives of the relatives
that Boeing may have acknowledged the inadequate repair only to
prevent further investigation.
   ``If flaws that caused the JAL accident were known to be
applicable to other airplanes, sales of the aircraft with a
dominant share all over the world would plunge,'' he said.
   Ryoma Kawamura, professor emeritus in aviation engineering at
Tokyo University, said a ``mere rupture of the bulkhead'' should
not make the entire hydraulic system fail.
   ``I heard Boeing has made improvements in the hydraulic system
of jumbo jets after the accident,'' he said. ``This alone indicates
that there were some serious defects with jumbo jets and the
company is aware of it.''
   In June 1986, Boeing directed all jumbo jet operators worldwide
to strengthen the rear bulkheads and install a safety valve near
the rear of the hydraulic system, where four systems merge into one.
   Prosecutors said they asked U.S. justice authorities for
permission to question two Boeing employees, Edward N. Stanford and
Alan C. Gardner, about the faulty repair.
   Yamaguchi said the request was refused because Japan could not
grant immunity from criminal prosecution in return for the men's
cooperation.
   ``I regret our inability to file criminal charges, but how can
we prosecute people in the United States when the American side is
not cooperating?'' Yamaguchi said. ``We don't have the judicial
power to question them as long as they are in the United States.''
   Some legal experts argue that Japan is entitled to full
jurisdiction because the accident occurred on its territory.
   About 90 percent of victims' compensation negotiations has been
settled. Boeing is paying 82.5 percent of the total and the airline
17.5 percent.
   Victims's relatives have received an average of $500,000, Mrs.
Miyajima said.
   She and other relatives said they will continue pressing for a
detailed explanation of what caused the accident.

   American troops in Saudi
Arabia face one of the world's nastiest climates.
   The Navy has been in the region since 1949 and knows what to
expect _ the USS La Salle is painted all white to reflect the
searing heat _ but American soldiers are entering the region for
the first time.
   Not even Vietnam, with oppressive heat, leeches and
insect-ridden swamps, taxed the capacity of men and equipment as
does open desert where daytime temperatures climb beyond 120
degrees.
   Dehydration, heat prostration, even vision problems, await those
who overexert or do not take precautions against the sun, heat,
sand and blowing sand.
   Logistics are perhaps the most difficult in the desert,
according to many military analysts.
   Individuals may need four to five gallons of water a day,
requiring huge amounts to be brought in with regular supplies.
   The lift capacity of helicopters is reduced as the mercury
rises. Weapons and sophisticated electronics tend to malfunction
because of heat expansion and dust-clogged working parts.
   Large military units and materiel can move quickly over Saudi
Arabia's excellent highways and flat terrain, but the lack of
natural cover leaves them vulnerable to attack, especially from the
air.
   ``It might be one reason why Saddam Hussein didn't keep going
into Saudi Arabia,'' said one U.S. military source. ``The farther
he goes, the more his supply lines are exposed, and he certainly
knows that.''
   He said Saddam's Iraqi forces appear formidable because they are
``close to home'' and experienced in desert warfare by the recent
eight-year war with Iran.
   ``We have the training, but no combat experience in this since
North Africa in World War II,'' he said.
   Most of the soldiers sent to the danger zone are said to be
deployed on the coast south of Kuwait, where Saudi Arabia's oil
fields are located.
   They will find being near the water offers little relief. The
Persian Gulf's shallow waters have been tested as high as 98
degrees.
   With a permanent ``show the flag'' patrol squadron known as the
Middle East Force in the gulf for more than 40 years, Navy has
considerable experience with the brutal climate. The La Salle, its
flagship, is the only American warship painted all white.
   Sailors on some ships follow schedules of two hours on and four
off in order to stay alert and avoid exhaustion, especially in the
boiler rooms, where temperatures can exceed 140 degrees.
   Officers say it is a constant struggle to keep dust, salt and
moisture away from shipboard computers, combat systems and
air-conditioners.
   Filters are replaced often to screen out dust without impairing
ventilation. Navy helicopters sent to the gulf in 1987 to sweep
mines laid by Iran had to be hosed down with fresh water every day
to prevent salt corrision.
   The combination of dust and humidity is especially hard on
pilots, who may find their visibility cut to less than a mile at
noon on a clear day. They run the risk of sudden sandstorms like
the one that wrecked the U.S. atttept to rescue hostages from Iran
in 1979.
   Even communications are affected, particularly over water and
coastal areas. High humidity causes a freakish effect called
``ducting'' that blocks radio signals at normal distances but makes
them audible hundreds of miles away.

   The United States should press Philippine
President Corazon Aquino's government to disarm the country's
numerous private armies and vigilante groups, a private U.S. human
rights organization said Saturday.
   Asia Watch accused both the government and communist New
People's Army insurgents of severe human rights violations and
urged international pressure against both sides to halt them.
   The Aquino government has actively encouraged the spread of
illegal vigilante groups to battle the insurgents, Asia Watch said,
rejecting arguments that this was justified by the communists'
resort to violence.
   ``All private armies and vigilante groups should be disarmed and
disbanded and their members prosecuted to the fullest extent of the
law for any offenses'' against civilians, Asia Watch asserted in a
100-page report entitled ``Violations of the Laws of War by Both
Sides.''
   Despite considerable U.S. influence in Philippine affairs,
``neither the Reagan nor the Bush administration has been willing
to put pressure on the Aquino government to improve its human
rights record,'' Asia Watch said.
   Administration arguments against such pressure are invalid, it
said, adding, ``a forceful denunciation of abuses by both sides''
is necessary.
   Asia Watch sharply criticized what it called ``privatization of
the counterinsurgency effort'' in the Philippines.
   Despite a constitutional ban on private armies, ``the government
has authorized private companies to fund paramilitary forces
composed of company employees who have virtually no accountability
to Manila,'' Asia Watch said. Vigilantes apparently are allowed to
take justice into their own hands, even targeting suspected
leftists for execution, the organization said.
   The communist guerrillas, meanwhile, engage in summary
executions, Asia Watch alleged, saying that its trials, if they
occur at all, fall ``far short of international standards of
fairness.''
   It urged the New People's Army to disband its ``Sparrow Units''
_ urban hit squads that attack soldiers and policemen for weapons _
on the ground that killing police who have no combat duties and
other strikes endangering civilians violate all rules of war.
   Asia Watch said that shortly after President Aquino came to
power in 1986, she took some steps to protect human rights but
neglected key actions such as failing to prosecute past abuses by
members of the military under deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``Had she done so, some of those subsequently involved in the
six attempted coups d'etat'' against her ``might well have been in
jail,'' it added.
   Since ``neither side can claim the high moral ground'' in the
Philippine conflict, lives can be saved only by getting both to
uphold ``their professed commitment to protect human rights,'' Asia
Watch said.
   Asia Watch is an affiliate of the Helsinki Watch-Human Rights
Watch group of organizations that monitor basic rights enumerated
in the 1975 Helsinki East-West Conference.

<HEAD>Cutoff of Iraq-Kuwait Oil Exports Appears Complete</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oil exports, virtually the sole source of
income for Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, have been stopped by an
international embargo, oil sources said Saturday.
   The cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports leaves a shortfall in
the world market of about 4 million barrels a day.
   But Persian Gulf producers are only expected to make up the
shortfall after large Western and Japanese stockpiles are allowed
to run down.
   Before its invasion of Kuwait, Iraq had been exporting 2.7
million barrels of oil a day _ at current prices worth more than
$20 billion a year _ through two pipelines, across Turkey and Saudi
Arabia, and by ship through the gulf.
   The pipeline across Turkey was carrying about 1.5 million
barrels a day. It was effectively shut by a Turkish order
forbidding ships to load Iraqi oil at the Yumurtalik terminal in
the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey acted in response to the U.N.
Security Council trade embargo against Iraq.
   The pipeline across Saudi Arabia was carrying about 800,000
barrels a day to a Red Sea terminal near Yanbu. Saudi Arabia has
not announced cutting the pipeline.
   But no ships are loading oil at the Yanbu terminal. Tankers
headed up the Red Sea to load Iraqi oil have turned back, most
recently the 357,000-ton Norwegian ship Hansa Vega on Friday.
   Informed oil sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Saudi Arabia is quietly warning shipowners not to load.
   ``The Saudis will act without declaring it,'' said one source.
   The sanction, the sources said, would be that countries loading
Iraqi oil would have no further access to oil from Saudi Arabia,
the world's largest exporter at 5 million barrels a day.
   Gulf-based oil executives told The Associated Press in Bahrain
that there have been no reports of any ships loading Iraqi oil at
the Mina al-Baqr terminal on the gulf. Iraq had been exporting
about 300,000 barrels a day by sea from its gulf terminal.
   The United States, which has 10 warships in the gulf, would be
unlikely to allow the passage of any cargo of Iraqi crude, citing
the U.N. embargo.
   The same gulf-based executives said no Kuwaiti oil has been
shipped since shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2. Iraq
annexed Kuwait Aug. 8.
   Kuwait oil exports were all made through the Gulf.
   Kuwait had been producing more than 2 million barrels a day
before agreeing at a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in July to keep to a production quota of 1.5
million barrels, of which more than 1.3 million would be exported.
   A sense of desperation in Iraq's situation became evident when
Baghdad sent Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi to Syria this week to
try to persuade Syria to re-open a pipeline which once carried
Iraqi crude across Syria to the Mediterranean port of Banias.
   Al-Chalabi's trip was confirmed by Syrian sources.
   Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival wings of the Arab Baath Socialist
Party have been carrying on a bitter feud for a decade.
   The pipeline was cut in 1982 when Syria sided with Iran in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   But Syria give Al-Chalabi no sign it was willing to reopen the
600,000-barrel-a-day pipeline.
   The only other outlet for Iraqi oil would be by land tankers
along a desert road through Jordan. But such an export route would
have only a 100,000-150,000 barrel-a-day capacity and there are no
assurances that ships would pick up the oil once it reached
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba.
   The daily Sharq al-Awsat newspaper, which is based in London and
backed by influential Saudis, quoted oil experts as saying gulf
producers with excess production capacity will abide by last
month's OPEC decision to absorb a worldwide oil glut.
   ``Absorbing the surplus in supply was one of the principal aims
of Geneva. Lowering huge stockpiles increases OPEC chances of
controlling the market,'' the paper said.
   Saudi Arabia has the capacity to increase its production by 2
million barrels a day while the United Arab Emirates can boost its
production by one million barrels a day.
   OPEC is believed likely to agree to increase production once the
glut is reduced. The increase in production would avoid a sharp
rise in oil prices that could force consuming nations to explore
alternative sources of energy.

   Mayor Marion Barry stands convicted of a
single cocaine offense after a riveting drug and perjury trial, but
he seems elated and his supporters are jubilant over his acquittal
on one count and mistrial on a dozen others.
   Shouts of ``Barry, Barry'' and ``four more years'' filled the
summer night Friday down the street from the mayor's home. Churches
opened across the city for unscheduled prayer services as word of
the trial's outcome spread.
   The 10-week trial featured videotaped evidence that showed Barry
smoking crack cocaine during an FBI sting operation.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy said, ``We feel very lucky.''
   But a smiling Barry did not comment after the verdict. He said
he would make a public appearance later today in the heart of the
city that three times elected him mayor.
   Racial factors did not enter the jury's deliberations on charges
facing Barry, who is black, juror Joseph Deoudes said today. ``I
didn't see any signs of racism either way,'' he said. ``We were
above all that.''
   Deoudes added that the jury ``systematically'' considered all
the charges ``a number of times'' before indicating Friday to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson it was deadlocked. He said
jurors had expected Jackson to order them to continue deliberating
and were surprise when the judge declared a mistrial.
   The stunning end to Barry's trial came Friday as the jury
announced it was unable to reach a verdict on 12 of the 14 charges
against the Mayor. They had deliberated for eight days.
   Barry announced as his trial got under way that he would not
seek a fourth term this fall, but he has told aides recently that
he would likely run for a city council seat. Political aides said
Friday the lone conviction actually increases the likelihood of
Barry running.
   ``Frankly, most of us were expecting worse,'' said one aide who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 12 deadlocked counts included a cocaine possession charge
stemming from an FBI sting operation that videotaped Barry smoking
crack cocaine in a hotel room last Jan. 18.
   The mayor's lawyers turned the dramatic videotape to their
advantage, saying the mayor was a victim of entrapment who had been
lured into committing a criminal act by one of his former
girlfriends, ex-model Rasheeda Moore.
   Juror Johnnie Mae Hardeman said the vote on the cocaine
possession charge arising from the sting operation was 6-6. She
said most votes the jury took on the other counts were 7-5 for
either conviction or acquittal.
   Barry insisted all along that he had been singled out by
vindictive federal prosecutors as a black leader. He said the
government spent millions trying to convict him, and the case
created racial tension in the nation's capital.
   The panel of 10 blacks and two whites had ``differences over
tough issues,'' but ``no anger,'' jury foreman Edward Eagles said
after deliberations.
   ``Never forget that famous phrase, that key phrase in law,
`beyond a reasonable doubt,''' Eagles said. ``That's a very, very
tough standard to meet.''
   Heckled outside the courthouse as he defended the prosecution of
the mayor, U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said the jury on the
conviction had held ``Mr. Barry accountable for his criminal
conduct and he must now accept responsibility for that conduct.''
   Stephens said he would review the case before deciding whether
to seek a retrial. Jackson scheduled a hearing for Sept. 17.
   Under federal guidelines, Barry faces a sentence ranging from
probation to a maximum of six months in jail. The maximum penalty
under the law is a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
   The conviction stems from courtroom testimony by longtime Barry
friend Doris Crenshaw. She testified that she snorted cocaine with
the mayor in a hotel room last November.
   The jury acquitted Barry of another cocaine possession charge,
in which admitted drug dealer Lydia Pearson testified that she
delivered crack to the mayor in a city office. A city employee
testified that he, not the mayor, met with Pearson the morning of
the alleged crack delivery.
   Barry sat stone faced when the single guilty verdict was
announced, but smiled broadly as the judge declared a mistrial on
three felony counts of perjury, eight counts of cocaine possession
and a single count of conspiracy.
   He turned to attorney Mundy, clasped his hand and threw his
other arm around Mundy's shoulder. He then turned and hugged his
press secretary and a supporter. He hugged other backers outside
the courthouse. His wife, Effi, was not at the courthouse.
   Barry would have faced a near-certain prison term had he been
convicted of one of the three felony perjury counts, which accused
the mayor of lying to a grand jury about his alleged involvement in
drugs with a friend, Charles Lewis.
   Eagles said the jurors ``came to grips'' with the perjury
charges but simply couldn't come up with a ``unanimous answer.''
   Barry's lawyer acknowledged the mayor was an ``occasional'' user
of cocaine but contended the government has not proven charges
concerning use at specific times and places.

   The largest Soviet republic has declared invalid
contracts signed by the central government to sell natural
resources, including $5 billion in diamonds, Tass reported Saturday.
   The declaration, approved Friday, opens a critical battle
between the national government and the Russian republic over the
divsion of power and resources. Russia is the largest and richest
of the 15 Soviet republics, with 75 percent of the Soviet Union's
land and much of its natural resources.
   The official Soviet news agency said the order invalidates all
contracts signed without Russia's approval to sell the republic's
diamonds, metals, oil, gas, uranium and manufactured goods the
republic considers ``strategic.''
   Most republics are considering ways of gaining control over
their own resources from the national government, but Russia's
attempt to halt a $5 billion diamond deal concluded in July would
be the first concrete step.
   Under the current command economy, all resources and products
are handed over to the central government, at prices set by Soviet
bureaucrats. The officials then redistribute everything around the
country.
   Russian leaders, including republic President Boris Yeltsin,
believe they cannot make fundamental changes in their economies as
long as this system continues, and they have no control or profit
from their natural wealth and labor.
   Tass did not say how the declaration would be enforced or give
any other details.
   The official Soviet news agency said the Kremlin has continued
to sell Russian resources abroad since the republic proclaimed its
sovereignty on June 12, often without notifying the Russian
government.
   It said the last straw was an exclusive five-year deal with the
De Beers company to market the Soviet Union's diamond output.
   The deal, which would tie up Russia's diamond production for the
next five years, is estimated to be worth $5 billion. The national
government was to receive a $1 billion dollar immediate loan as
part of the deal.
   The Soviet Union is one of the world's biggest gem diamond
producers, and most of its stones come from the Yakutia region of
northeastern Siberia. Moscow does not disclose the value of its
diamond output.
   Tass said the Russian parliament only learned about the July 25
agreement between De Beers and Glavalmazzoloto, the Soviet diamond
and precious metals marketing body, through newspaper accounts.
   There has been no formal reaction to the Russian announcement,
but Tass quoted an unnamed official of the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations as saying it would harm the Soviet economy.
   ``The statements of the Russian Parliament ... can lead to
losing confidence in Soviet organizations as trading partners and
may lead to economic losses,'' Tass quoted him as saying.
   Yeltsin has said he will cooperate with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in moving to a market economy, but that his first
priority is to defend Russia's interests.
   Russia is also the source of much of the Soviet Union's oil,
another key hard currency export. The Soviet Union is the world's
biggest oil producer, and its largest oil region is the sprawling
Tyumen fields of western Siberia.
   Pravda reported Saturday that while the Kremlin and the
republics are waging a debate on resource ownership, a third party
is claiming the ``black gold'' of the Tyumen oil fields.
   The presidium of the obscure autonomous region of Khanty
Mansiysk, which is part of Russia, claimed ownership of its land
and resources, including the Tyumen oil, the paper said. Autonomous
republics have the power to administer some of their own affairs,
but are subordinate to republican authorities.
   Pravda quoted opponents of the decision as saying all Soviet
republics and the central government invested billions of rubles in
developing the north, so the region's oil production and minerals
should belong to the nation.

   Contingents of Egyptian and Moroccan
troops began arriving in Saudi Arabia today, diplomatic sources
said, one day after a dozen Arab leaders agreed to dispatch a force
to prevent an Iraqi invasion.
   The Arab troops were landing at Hafr al-Baten, the same
northeastern Saudi base where the U.S. rapid deployment force has
been building up. The diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Egypt and Morocco were each expected to provide at
least 5,000 troops.
   The sources said said troops were expected to continue arriving
for at least several days.
   The Egyptian and Moroccan troops are arriving under the flags of
their respective countries because not all 21 members of the Arab
League agreed on a pan-Arab force. Instead, 12 countries voted to
send troops.
   The dispatch of the Egyptian troops was reported earlier today
by official Egyptian media, quoting the president's office.
   ``Egypt has begun sending advance units of the Egyptian forces
that will participate in an Arab umbrella to safeguard the
region,'' Cairo Radio said.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had said Friday the Egyptian
forces would fight ``if someone launches an aggression.'' He did
not mention Iraq by name but his remarks were clearly aimed at it.
   Mubarak spoke to reporters after seeing off several Arab leaders
leaving Cairo after a Friday's one-day Arab League summit. He
organized the emergency session to deal with Iraq's invasion and
annexation of Kuwait and general belligerence toward its neighbors.
   ``We are on our way to sending some units to some Arab
countries,'' Mubarak told reporters when asked about the projected
force.
   The United States has sent troops, fighter planes and warships
to the gulf region, while Britain and France have sent ships. It
was not immediately known what links the Arab troops would have
with the U.S. ground forces.
   Leaders of 12 Arab states voted Friday to send troops to protect
Saudi Arabia and other gulf states from Iraq and to impose economic
sanctions to punish the Baghdad government.
   The Arab measures were by far the toughest against Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein since his forces attacked Kuwait Aug. 2
and began massing troops along Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia.
   The summit resolution did not name the other gulf states that
requested Arab military help. But Arab diplomatic sources said they
believed one was the United Arab Emirates, which Iraq has accused
of depressing oil prices by overproduction.
   Neither did the resolution say which countries would contribute
troops to the gulf states' Arab force. Under Arab League rules, the
resolution is binding on all 12 signatories but such signers as
Djibouti and Somalia are too weak militarily to participate.
   What was billed Friday as a final attempt by Arab leaders to
diplomatically solve Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ended in a call to
arms and a vote to join international economic sanctions against
Baghdad.
   Despite the effort to settle an inter-Arab dispute among Arabs,
a shouting match broke out between Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials
during which the Kuwaiti foreign minister fainted, a conference
source said.
   Libya, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Iraq voted
against the package, while Algeria and Yemen abstained. Three
governments _ Jordan, Sudan and Mauritania _ expressed reservations
and took no position.
   The Arab League had 22 members until May, when the merger of
North Yemen and South Yemen lowered membership to 21. They are
Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon,
Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia,
Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and the
Palestine Liberation Organization, now officially listed as
Palestine.

<HEAD>Top Terrorist Suspect Calls for End to Deadly Struggle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of West Germany's top leftist terrorist
suspects has urged her comrades to end their violent attacks. The
appeal was made in a magazine essay written by the suspect and
released Saturday.
   Sigrid Sternebeck, who is in jail awaiting trial on terrorist
charges including the 1985 bombing of the U.S. Air Force's
sprawling Rhein-Main Base outside Frankfurt, wrote the essay for an
upcoming edition of the Der Spiegel magazine.
   Following her capture in East Germany in June, there was
widespread speculation that Ms. Sternebeck would give testimony to
authorities. She claims to have renounced the Red Army Faction
terrorist group, of which she was once a member.
   In the essay, Ms. Sternebeck urged the dozens of Red Army
Faction members she said are still at large to abandon their
guerrilla campaign.
   ``War and destruction _ these are not the instruments for
political arguments on the threshold of the year 2000,'' Ms.
Sternebeck wrote.
   The 40-year-old prisoner added that the ``concept of urban
guerrilla warfare has failed.''
   The essay will appear in Spiegel's editions reaching newsstands
on Monday.
   The magazine released excerpts in advance.
   The Hamburg-based publication said the appeal was aimed at the
``hard core'' of the Red Army Faction.
   West German radio and television news programs prominently
featured Ms. Sternebeck's comments Saturday.
   The Red Army Faction has been waging a deadly campaign against
West German businesses and NATO installations since the 1970s.
   Recent victims include Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen,
who was killed instantly when a bomb ripped through his car in
November.
   On July 27, Red Army Faction members triggered a bomb that badly
damaged the car of Hans Neusel, the Bonn government's top
anti-terrorism expert. He escaped serious injury.
   Many active Red Army Faction members reportedly receive
instructions from their imprisoned comrades.
   Ms. Sternebeck is believed to be seeking a reduced sentence in
return for her cooperation with prosecutors.
   In the Spiegel essay, Ms. Sternebeck denied having any role in
the 1985 bombing of the U.S. air force base.
   She also claimed she was not involved in killing a U.S. soldier
whose identity card was used to gain access to the sprawling
facility.
   Ms. Sternebeck, however, did admitted to helping stock secret
terrorist depots with guns and ammunition in the 1970s.
   She wrote that she moved to East Germany in 1980 and kept up
regular contacts with the secret police.
   That relationship came to an abrupt end after the peaceful
revolution swept out the Communists.
   ``We can't do anything more for you,'' she quoted her secret
police contact as saying in his parting words.
   East Germany's democratic government has accused the former
hard-line Communist administration of harboring Red Army Faction
terrorists.
   Seven other Red Army Faction terrorists were rounded up in East
Germany this summer.

<DATELINE>SACHSENHAUSEN, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerna Friedrich clutched a
faded photograph Saturday, hoping someone would recognize her
long-dead father.
   She was one of the hundreds of survivors and relatives who
gathered to remember the Germans _ some of them Nazis _ who died in
the Soviet-run Sachsenhausen camp after World War II.
   During the Third Reich, Sachenhausen was a notorious Nazi
concentration camp. But after the war, it was used as a prison by
the Stalinist-era Soviet secret police.
   The Soviets imprisoned tens of thousands of suspected Nazi
criminals or Germans opposed to the postwar Soviet occupation, and
thousands of the internees died. The Soviet zone later became East
Germany.
   Mrs. Friedrich, 70, said her father served in the Nazi police
force during the war. The Soviets arrested him in 1945 and she
never saw him again.
   ``We hope somebody here will have seen him,'' she said. ``We are
trying to find about him from other prisoners.''
   The death certificate she received in 1949 said her father, a
butcher, had died a year earlier. In keeping with Soviet practice,
the document did not say where, and she was never able to find out.
   After efforts to locate him through the Red Cross failed, she
traced an East German man who said he seen her father in
Sachsenhausen.
   ``We looked for him secretly, but we never got any
information,'' said Mrs. Friedrich's son, Wilfried.
   Such a search would have been impossible a year ago when
Communist authorities still ruled East Germany. Speaking about the
Soviet crimes of the Stalinist era was taboo.
   But since the Berlin Wall crumbled, East Germans have been
examining the most brutal period in their postwar history, covered
over for decades by Communist propaganda.
   An early focus of interest was the former Nazi death camp at
Buchenwald, 120 miles southwest of Berlin. Like Sachsenhausen, it
was used by the Soviets as an internment camp.
   ``We never liked the Soviets. We wanted to leave for the West,
but we didn't make it,'' said Gisela Ketten.
   The Soviets accused Mrs. Ketten's husband, Karl-Heinz, an
engineer who worked on a Nazi rocket project, of spying. When she
refused to testify against him, both were convicted of espionage
and sent to Sachsenhausen.
   Karl-Heinz then spent six years in Siberia. The couple fled to
West Berlin when he returned from frozen wasteland in 1956.
   Mrs. Ketten fought back tears as she tried to describe what it
meant to come back to Sachsenhausen for the first time in four
decades.
   ``I can only thank God we survived and can now honor those who
were here with us,'' she said.
   Guenther Agde, a former inmate, came up with the idea of
erecting a monument to the victims of Stalinism at the well-tended
camp 21 miles north of Berlin.
   There was already a large museum devoted to resistance movements
against Hitler as well as many books and leaflets about the camp,
where about 100,000 people died after it was set up in 1936.
   But only a small new brochure, printed after last fall's
revolution swept the East German Communist leaders from power,
mentions the camp's history as a Soviet prison from 1945 to 1950.
   ``This stone is the first sign of memory,'' Agde told a crowd of
several hundred people, including former inmates and their
families. Dozens of wreaths were laid at the foot of the granite
stone monument that pays tribute to the ``victims of Stalinist
decrees.''
   Karl-Heinz Reuter, a former inmate, estimated up to 25,000
Germans died in the Sachsenhausen camp at Soviet hands.
   When the crowd dispersed after the ceremony, Mrs. Friedrich and
her son remained. They hoped there might be latecomers, and that
someone might recognize the face in the photograph.

<HEAD>Tips for Easing Child's Adjustment to Divorce</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Children-Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some tips from University of Rochester
researchers on how to help a child adjust to a divorce.
   _ Children need time to adjust to each family change, such as
moving, visitation and remarriage.
   _ Once a firm decision is made about separation or divorce, tell
children ahead of time in a way they can understand. If possible,
parents should tell their children together.
   _ Accept children's feelings and help them learn to talk about
their feelings.
   _ Make sure children know you love them, that you will take care
of them and that the divorce is not their fault. Remind them that
parents divorce each other, not their children, and that your love
for them will endure.
   _ Let your children continue to be children. Encourage school
activities and hobbies that develop their strengths and abilities.
Discussing family finances with them or designating them the
``little man'' or ``little woman'' of the house can be a burden,
and so can giving them too many ``adult'' responsibilities.
   _ Do not criticize the other parent in front of your children.
They benefit from a positive relationship with both parents.
   _ Talk with your children about how to make things better or
more comfortable for them.
   _ Set aside 15 minutes each day to spend with each child, doing
things together such as reading a book, playing a game or taking a
walk.
   _ Keep arguments with the other parent as far away from children
as possible. Do not use your child as a messenger or a weapon to
get back at the former spouse.
   _ Keep as much structure and predictability in your everyday
routine as possible. Children thrive on routine, including regular
bedtimes, meals together and consistent rules. Limits let children
know they are safe.
   _ Pay attention to what your children say and do. They often say
things indirectly. A child who says, ``I hate the woman you're
dating'' may really mean, ``I'm worried that you like her more than
you like me.''
   _ Take care of yourself. Use such resources as trusted friends,
family, books, support groups, clergy and mental health
professionals. Parents' emotional and physical well-being are
linked to children's healthy development.

   President Bush today personally
thanked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for the Arab League's
decision to add Arab troops to the multinational effort aimed at
thwarting Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   The White House also called it ``encouraging'' that 11
Americans, including 10-year-old Penelope Nabokov, were allowed to
leave Iraq earlier today.
   ``Our embassy is in contact almost hourly with Iraqi officials
concerning the safety of U.S. citizens,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   Pentagon sources said today in Washington, meanwhile, that
Patriot ground-to-air missiles were earmarked for deployment in
Saudi Arabia, and that U.S. Stinger shoulder-fired guided missiles
already had arrived in the kingdom as the United States prepares
for a possible Iraqi invasion.
   Other anti-aircraft missiles to be deployed include the
Chaparral, a supersonic mobile heat-seeking missile that is capable
of knocking out aircraft and helicopters at low altitude, the
sources said.
   The Army was continuing the buildup of U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia, the Pentagon also said.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Pentagon source confirmed
that elements of the 101st Airborne Division, an air assault unit
based at Fort Campbell, Ky., was being sent to join the U.S.
operation, code-named Desert Shield.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft were flying up to Maine from Washington to
brief Bush at his oceanfront home on the latest developments in the
Persian Gulf crisis. Baker is just back from talks with NATO allies
in Brussels and Ankara, Turkey.
   Bush said Friday before arriving here for a 25-day vacation that
Saddam Hussein's call for holy war against Americans was a
``frantic ploy'' by an Iraqi despot faced with outright
condemnation by most of the Arab world.
   The White House applauded the decision by a divided Arab League
on Friday to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and clear the way
for Arab states to join the growing multinational force standing
guard in the Saudi Arabian desert and Persian Gulf.
   Fitzwater said Bush called Mubarak at 5:45 a.m. EDT ``to
congratulate him on the successful outcome of the Arab League
meeting. The president praised (his) constructive role in securing
passage of the resolution to send Arab troops to participate in a
multinational force.''
   ``The president said the Arab League action was very favorable
and gives us significant optimism for the future of the mission,''
Fitzwater said.
   Bush also called the emir of Bahrain, another oil-rich Gulf
kingdom, and planned also to call the emir of Qatar to extend his
thanks, Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said the United Nations sanctions against Iraq ``are
being widely implemented and there is no Iraqi oil leaving Turkey
or Saudi Arabia.''
   He repeated that ``planning for a blockade is under way, should
it be necessary,'' but stressed that ``the embargo appears to be
having a considerable effect.''
   Bush went out boating this morning, despite a driving rain.
   The White House said the Arab League resolution, approved by 12
of the 20 states at a summit in Cairo, ``provides a basis for
individual (Arab) governments to send forces to support Saudi
Arabia and other Arab states of the gulf.''
   On Friday, Bush said Saddam has been ``backed into a corner by
world opinion.'' The Iraqi leader's call to drive Americans from
the land of Mecca is ``a rather frantic ploy,'' Bush said, but ``it
will not work.''
   Bush expressed concern about the 3,500 Americans detained in
Iraq and Kuwait, as well as the ``very disturbing reports of
violence against the citizens of several countries.'' But he
stopped short of calling the Americans hostages.
   The State Department said diplomatic posts worldwide had been
urged to ``take appropriate security precautions'' out of concern
that the Mideast crisis might lead to terrorist acts against
Americans elsewhere.
   Before heading to Maine, Bush sent Congress two letters
notifying it of the steps he has taken to respond to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. It was his way of complying with the War Powers
Act, despite an administration view that the post-Vietnam war
statute is unconstitutional.
   Bush told Congress he did not think hostilities were
``imminent.'' He said U.S. troops, spearheaded by units of the 82nd
Airborne Division, would remain on Saudi soil ``so long as their
presence is required to contribute to the security of the region.''
   Pentagon sources said that eventually 250,000 ground troops
could be deployed if Iraq took aim at the Saudi oil fields. Several
commercial airlines said they had been asked to help shuttle troops
to the Middle East.
   The Pentagon said other additional units involved in the buildup
included F-16 fighter planes from Shaw Air Force Base, S.C. and
C-130 transports from Pope Air Force Base, N.C.; the Navy hospital
ships Mercy from Oakland, Calif., and Comfort from Baltimore; and
elements of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort
Stewart, Ga.
   While designed to cripple Iraq's already weak economy, the
sanctions were exacting a toll in the United States as well. Fare
increases imposed by some commercial airlines because of higher
fuel costs kicked in Friday.

   Iraq said Saturday it has shut down the
Kuwait News Agency, in the latest move meant to solidify Baghdad's
hold on the emirate it invaded. But the agency said it was still in
business.
   The official Iraqi News Agency announced the dissolution of the
Kuwait News Agency in a statement distributed to foreign news
agencies. It said the Kuwait agency's overseas bureaus no longer
had official status, and the work of its correspondents was ``null
and void.''
   The decree was effective Aug. 8, the date that Iraq annexed
Kuwait. The United Nations Security Council has refused to
recognize the annexation.
   KUNA's office in London said the agency was still operating,
with all its offices open except those in Iraq and Kuwait. The news
agency's headquarters in Kuwait city were shut down immediately
after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion.
   ``We are functioning on a higher gear, more than before,'' the
agency said in a statement. On Saturday, for example, its London
bureau filed a dispatch describing conditions in Kuwait, quoting
Kuwaitis who had managed to flee the country.
   The agency, which has a reputation for aggressive Western-style
newsgathering and reporting, had more than 300 employees, and
offices in world capitals including Washington.
   It transmitted to local and foreign subscribers in Arabic and
English and exchanged news with about 30 regional and international
news agencies.
   Freedom of the press and publishing was guaranteed under the
Kuwaiti constitution. Before the Iraqi occupation, the country had
as many as eight daily newspapers and more han 100 weeklies and
periodicals.
   The Kuwait News Agency's reporting sometimes touched off
controversies with the government and other Arab governments.
   The former chairman and general director of the agency, Barges
Hammoud al-Barges, resigned in June after elections for an interim
National Council.
   Sources said he quit to protest accusations he manipulated the
news agency to favor pro-democracy activists, although the
Information Ministry said he had merely reached retirement age.

<TEXT>
   This is a time of uncertainty for
Pakistan's fledgling democracy, a time for Benazir Bhutto to assess
the disappointments and missed chances of her 20 months as prime
minister.
   Critics say her government created its own problems through
squandered opportunities, political squabbling and official greed.
   In December 1988, Ms. Bhutto became the first woman to lead a
modern Moslem country. The election victory of her Pakistan
People's Party was called a triumph for democracy after more than a
decade of military rule.
   President Ghulam Ishad Khan dismissed her Monday, citing rampant
``corruption and nepotism,'' and appointed a caretaker government.
   Ms. Bhutto said Saturday that her Pakistan Peoples Party planned
to fight the ``illegal and unconstitutional' dismissal of her
administration in the Supreme Court.
   ``We made mistakes but our performance exceeds our mistakes,''
she said.
   As the self-proclaimed ``poor people's sister,'' Ms. Bhutto
promised a better life for a nation of 110 million people burdened
by poverty, corruption and ethnic violence.
   Ms. Bhutto, wealthy and educated in the West, won the election
largely on a wave of sympathy for her father, Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown by Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq
in 1977 and executed two years later.
   She never had a job before becoming prime minister, and her
inexperience began to show within months of the inauguration.
   ``She could never graduate from being leader of the opposition
to being the prime minister of Pakistan,'' a senior Western
diplomat said. ``Compromise was not a word in her vocabulary. She
invariably saw everything in terms of `them' and `us.'''
   Her minority government left Pakistan much as it was on Aug. 17,
1988, the day a mysterious plane crash killed Zia and opened the
way to democracy.
   At least part of the responsibility for her failure rests with
opposition groups loyal to Zia, which used their power to block
change and vowed from the first day to unseat her.
   For her part, Ms. Bhutto would not try to make peace with her
political enemies, many of whom she blamed for her father's death.
   Her arrogance, stubbornness and combativeness only made the
situation worse.
   The former prime minister, 37, is widely criticized for poor
judgment in selecting her Cabinet ministers and advisers.
   She refused to dismiss her deputy finance minister even after a
high court said he was guilty of corruption and nepotism. Even
supporters were outraged when she appointed a doctor who hosts a
television show as Pakistan's ambassador to the United Nations.
   ``Nowhere was Ms. Bhutto's lack of competence more evident than
in the choice of people to advise her,'' said Khalid Hasan, a loyal
supporter of her father. ``With one or two exceptions, they were
men of straw. They could neither offer advice nor contribute to the
work of government,''
   That her government survived at all is a tribute to Ms. Bhutto's
personal reputation.
   While she fought to save her government, the country drifted.
   Unemployment and inflation rose. Her government failed to bring
reform, to repeal harsh Islamic laws imposed by Zia or alter tax
laws that give wealthy landowners a free ride in Pakistan, where
the annual per capita income is $390.
   ``If her conduct is to be attributed to the advice given by her
Cabinet and her army of hangers-on, even then the responsiblity for
accepting that advice was and will remain hers,'' Hasan said. ``She
sat behind the table where the buck stopped.''
   Corruption, endemic in Pakistan, continued to flourish. Ms.
Bhutto's husband and father-in-law have been accused of profiting
as intermediaries for people seeking lucrative government contracts.
   Some ministers and top officials allegedly made fortunes from
kickbacks or used their positions to obtain loans for themselves or
friends, with little or no collateral.
   Tens of thousands of jobs in the huge bureacracy went to leaders
of Ms. Bhutto's political party, their relatives and friends.
   She called the corruption charges a ``witch hunt'' by the
opposition, amazing even those who admired her.
   The public and powerful army generals became increasingly
dissatisfied and Ishaq Khan warned her repeatedly to clean up her
government.
   When she was dismissed, Ms. Bhutto accused the army of
engineering ``a constitutional coup.''
   Ms. Bhutto, her husband and members of her government are
expected to face a judicial inquiry. Many fear that will delay
elections and may lead to another military takeover.
   Ms. Bhutto told reporters Saturday that she would not appear
before any special tribunal. But she said she would present herself
before a civilian court.

   George Lucas, creator of the ``Star Wars''
and ``Indiana Jones'' movie series, is planning a film about the
Tuskegee Airmen, the famed all-black World War II fighter squadron.
   The story of ``Red Tails,'' named for the red paint found on the
squadron's planes, will be the first in a long-term deal Lucas
plans to cut with a studio yet to be determined.
   ``I'm sure to encounter resistance,'' he said. ``But I'm one of
the few people who can get this film made. I see the movie less as
a race picture than as an aerial action adventure. `Top Gun' proved
there's an audience for that.''
   The Tuskegee Airmen, formed from a select group of 926 blacks
trained at Alabama's Tuskegee Army Flying School, was created after
the Army Air Corps was ordered by Congress to lift a color ban in
1940.
   The squadron flew 1,578 support missions from bases in North
Africa and Europe without losing a single bomber to enemy fire.
   ``Red Tails'' also will focus on the pilots' lives once they
returned to civilian life, only to face continued racism and
segregation, said screenwriter Kevin Sullivan.
   ``Overnight, they went from heroes to second-class citizens,''
Sullivan said. ``It's a story that somehow got lost in our
history,'' he said.

   A neighborhood group holding an
anti-drug rally has rescinded an invitation to one-time civil
rights pioneer James H. Meredith, who's now a staff aide to
archconservative Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Meredith, who broke the color barrier at the University of
Mississippi in 1962, recently charged that the majority of
delegates to a National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People's convention were ``involved in the drug culture'' or
engaged in ``criminal or immoral activities.''
   The Grand Rapids South East End Neighborhood Association voted
last week to remove Meredith from a list of speakers for its
Anti-Drug Education Rally and Festival during Labor Day weekend.
   The group's director, Cynthia Townsend, who invited Meredith to
speak, refused to comment on the board's reversal, saying only:
``It's so sensitive right now.''
   Said Meredith: ``It doesn't particularly surprise me. I've been
on the blacklist of the liberal-controlled establishment for the
past five or six years.''

   Actor Judd Hirsch has a new pet, a 175-pound
California mountain lion. But the star of the sitcom ``Dear John''
won't have to worry about the big cat chewing up his furniture or
attacking his guests.
   The mountain lion will continue to live at the Los Angeles Zoo,
where it can be seen in a show that teaches visitors about wild
animals that live in Southern California.
   Hirsch adopted it through the Ralston Purina Big Cat Survival
Fund, a $1 million program to save rare and endangered cats at zoos

   He made a ``significant donation'' for the cat's adoption
Friday, officials of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association said.
In exchange, the lion will be named Judd.

   Glenn Close insists she fits the part
of a prairie woman in the Hallmark Hall of Fame production,
``Sarah, Plain and Tall.''
   ``I'm trying to be tall,'' the 5-foot-4 actress said, raising
her skirt just enough to expose her elevated boots. ``I've added
four inches to my height.''
   As for plain, she said: ``I'm a New Englander and I think of New
Englanders as being plain-spoken and unadorned and that kind of
thing. There are different interpretations.''
   Ms. Close was in this small southeastern Kansas town to film
part of the production scheduled for airing on CBS early next year.
Filming in Kansas was scheduled to conclude Saturday.
   She plays Sarah Wheaton, a Maine woman who answers a newspaper
ad from a newly widowed prairie farmer in 1910. Christopher Walken
plays Jacob Witting, the lonely farmer seeking a mother for his two
young children.
   The movie is based on Patricia MacLachlan's 1985 book that won
the Newberry Medal for outstanding children's literature.
   Ms. Close, a five-time Oscar nominee, appear infrequently on
television. The star of ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Dangerous
Liaisons'' was last seen on TV in ``Stones for Ibarra,'' another
Hallmark Hall of Fame production.

   A heavyweight boxer turned Hollywood
actor says the only fights he gets into now are with his wife.
   ``And she wins,'' Nashville resident Randall ``Tex'' Cobb said
about his wife, Sharon, who's a music producer-writer with their
record label and song publishing company, Heavyweight Titles.
   Cobb is most remembered for the beating he took from Larry
Holmes in a 1982 bout. The fight was so bloody that former TV
commentator Howard Cosell said it made him quit covering the sport.
   ``I can make more money selling the movie business than I could
selling my blood in the ring,'' Cobb said recently.
   Cobb made his movie debut in ``Uncommon Valor'' and had roles in
``Raising Arizona'' and ``The Champ.''
   His next movie, ``Blind Fury,'' is coming out this fall, he
said. He plays a heavy, much like earlier roles.
   ``I am another scum-sucking dog in this one _ a role that anyone
would be embarrassed to know me, much less bring me home with

   Iraq had been exporting 2.7 million barrels of oil a day by ship
through the Persian Gulf and pipelines across Turkey and Saudi
Arabia.
   Turkey banned ships from loading Iraqi oil at a terminal in the
eastern Mediterranean, and no ships are loading in the Red Sea at
the terminal off Saudi Arabia. The latest tanker to turn back was
Norway's 357,000-ton Hansa Vega.
   Oil executives in Bahrain said there have been no reports of any
ships loading Iraqi oil at the Mina al-Baqr terminal at the head of
the Persian Gulf, mainly because of the presence of U.S. warships.
   Asked if Iraqi tankers would be stopped, President Bush said
Friday: ``Put it this way. I would advise Iraqi ships not to go out
with oil.''
   The fate of foreigners trapped inside Iraq remained a concern.
   Italy, as head of the 12-nation European Community, protested
Iraq's decision to block their passage said Baghdad would be
responsible for their safety.
   In addition to the Americans, five West Germans also arrived at
the Jordanian border Saturday, but their identities were not
immediately known.
   Also, Britain's Foreign Office said 21 British citizens have
escaped from Kuwait. Seven contacted the embassy in Bahrain and 14
contacted the embassy in Saudi Arabia after crossing the border
Friday night. There were no details on their escape.
   The South Korean government decided to evacuate its citiziens in
Iraq and Kuwait. Officials at the Foreign Ministry said plans have
been made to to evacuate the 640 Koreans in Kuwait and the 620
Koreans in Iraq by air and sea.
   India has also drawn up plans to evacuate more than 170,000 of
its nationals caught in the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

   They were split down the middle, even after
watching Mayor Marion Barry smoke crack cocaine on videotape.
   Jurors' doubts about the motives and truthfulness of Barry's
chief accusers led to a stunning mistrial on 12 of the 14 charges
at his drug and perjury trial, and the FBI's undercover tape of
Barry ingesting the drug wasn't enough to overcome those doubts,
jurors said.
   The jury divided 6-6 on the charge arising from Barry's arrest
Jan. 18 at the Vista Intercontinental Hotel _ when the mayor was
videotaped smoking crack cocaine _ and on one perjury count,
according to juror Johnnie Mae Hardeman. The panel split 7-5 for
acquittal on two remaining perjury counts, she added.
   Barry was convicted Friday on one misdemeanor drug possession
count and acquitted on another. The jury deadlocked on three felony
perjury charges, one misdemeanor drug conspiracy count and eight
misdemeanor drug charges.
   The jury doubted the credibility of key prosecution witnesses
Charles Lewis and Rasheeda Moore, said Hardeman, a former
department store supervisor.
   Lewis, a convicted drug dealer, testified that he used cocaine
with Barry four times in 1988.
   Moore had lured Barry to the Vista hotel room where he was
videotaped and arrested.
   ``See, Charles Lewis and all them witnesses, all of them had
something to gain. And see, the government paid them off, so that's
it,'' Hardeman said.
   Hardeman declined to reveal how the panel voted on the 10 other
charges. Other jurors said the panel members agreed not to discuss
individual votes.
   Some jurors were surprised when U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson declared a mistrial on the remaining 12 charges.
   ``We were really thinking he was going to send us back to the
hotel for the weekend,'' juror Joseph Deoudes said Saturday.
``Nobody wanted to stay another weekend. I think he saw the
handwriting. I don't think further deliberations would have brought
out anything.''
   Jury foreman Edward P. Eagles, a history teacher at a
prestigious private school, reminded reporters, ``Never forget that
famous phrase, that key phrase, in law `beyond a reasonable doubt.'
That's a very, very tough standard to meet.''
   Jurors described the deliberations as calm, conscientious,
orderly, objective and devoid of racial overtones among the panel
members. Ten jurors were black, two white.
   ``I don't think people were looking at the case in terms of race
or politics,'' said Deoudes, 23. ``I didn't see any signs of racism
either way. We were above all that.''
   ``It was not black against white,'' Hardeman said. ``It was more
government against mayor.''
   Juror Harridell Jones, 58, said, ``We had differences of
opinion, but we got along fine'' and argued points about the
testimony.
   Once the jury returned to the hotel each night, ``there was good
rapport with everyone,'' Deoudes said.
   Eagles told reporters that jurors exchanged phone numbers and
addresses and he predicted that friendships will remain ``once you
all go on to other activities.''
   The jurors were housed at a hotel in New Carrollton, Md., on the
night of Aug. 2 when the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration
staged a drug sting operation in the parking lot.
   Deoudes said the jury ``had an idea what had happened'' that
night, but they didn't find out until after the trial that the
suspect was Brian Tribble, who was acquitted in a 1987 drug case in
connection with the death of University of Maryland basketball star
Len Bias.
   He said some jurors rooms faced the parking lot and they saw men
with FBI and DEA jackets that night. In the morning, Deoudes said,
``There were television reporters all around when we left the
hotel, so we knew our location had been compromised.''
   The jury was moved to a different hotel that day.

<HEAD>Hector Barrantes, Stepfather of Sarah Ferguson, Dies at 51</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentine polo player Hector
Barrantes, stepfather of Britain's Duchess of York, died after a
long battle with cancer, the official news agency Telam reported
Saturday. He was 51.
   Barrantes died Friday at his polo ranch in Guamini, 335 miles
southwest of Buenos Aires, the agency said.
   He was buried Saturday at Peace Garden cemetery in Buenos Aires.
   The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, returned to
London from Argentina on Thursday morning after a 10-day visit to
her ailing stepfather. She made the trip to Argentina with her two
children, Princess Beatrice, 2, and 4-month-old Princess Eugenie.
   In London, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said she was informed
immediately after his death Friday night. ``There is no question of
her returning to Argentina immediately,'' said the spokesman, who
by custom was not identified.
   The duchess is spending the weekend quietly with friends, the
spokesman said. Her husband, Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen
Elizabeth II, is a Royal Navy pilot currently on duty aboard HMS
Campbelton.
   Barrantes, born to a poor, working-class family, rose to become
a man who was at home with the British aristocracy.
   He got his big break at 15 when he was introduced to polo ponies.
   He first came to England in 1967 and three years later was
employed by Lord Vestey to play polo for Vestey's Stowell Park team.
   Barrantes first wife died in a car crash.
   In 1974, shock waves flowed through British society when Susan
Ferguson, niece of Viscount Powerscourt, left her husband, Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, and her daughters Sarah and Jane, to start a new
life with her husband's rival on the polo field. The Fergusons'
18-year marriage ended in divorce that year and Barrantes married
Susan in a civil ceremony in Argentina in 1975.
   Barrantes detected the first warning signs of cancer in
September, underwent surgery at a Buenos Aires clinic, and was
flown to New York where doctors confirmed he had cancer of the
lymph glands.
   He underwent chemotherapy before returning to his 1,000 acre
ranch, El Pucara, where he bred polo ponies. Barrantes had
described his illness as the ``first great inconvenience I've ever
encountered.''
   In an interview with Hello! magazine, he said: ``I'm not afraid
of dying. Having a clear conscience makes you face death in another
way.''
   He told the magazine the ranch would eventually be left to the
duchess.
   ``Sarah was there when we started work on the ranch in 1980. We
planted the first trees with her. She helped us move over there.
Sarah loves the place and in the end it will be hers.''
   Despite the rupture in Anglo-Argentine relations following the
1982 Falklands War, Barrantes was welcomed by the queen and Prince
Philip to the extended royal family when Andrew married his
stepdaughter in 1986.
   The duchess was the first member of the royal family to visit
Argentina since the war. Argentina and Britain restored full
diplomatic relations earlier this year.
   Barrantes is survived by his wife, Susan.

   Police and soldiers regained
control of riot-torn areas of Port Elizabeth Saturday, but unrest
flared in a nearby town. Authorities said 47 people were killed in
six days of rioting in the area.
   Heavily armed police and army patrols dispersed protesters in
scattered violence in Uitenhage, 15 miles inland from Port
Elizabeth, according to local news reports. The church of a leading
mixed-race politician was burned in an arson attack Friday night,
the reports said.
   Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
security forces had regained control of the region after six days
of rioting, arson and looting in the two cities.
   Police said the discovery of another body had raised the death
toll in the unrest that began Monday to 47.
   Hundreds of people were injured in the week of violence and 274
people were arrested in connection with 136 cases of looting and
arson.
   In Pretoria, at least 12 people were injured Saturday in a blast
police said was caused by commercial explosives. The explosive
device had been placed in a garbage can outside a fast food outlet
in a predominantly black shopping area.
   Eleven blacks and one mixed-race man were injured, two of them
seriously.
   The leader of the mixed-race Labor Party, Allan Hendrickse,
returned Saturday to his hometown of Uitenhage to find his
Congregational Church gutted by fire.
   Hendrickse, the Minister of Education and Culture in the
mixed-race chamber of Parliament said he had no doubt the attack
had been aimed at him.
   The racially-based Tricameral Parliament, of which Hendrickse is
part, was condemned by most blacks and people of mixed race as a
``sell-out'' to apartheid when it was instituted in 1983.
   The unrest in the area was apparently sparked by high home
rentals, a lack of proper water supply, lack of facilities and
inadequate schools.
   The riots began Monday between members of a political group and
police at a meeting to protest rent increases and educational
problems.
   According to police, criminals joined the political protesters
and were responsible for much of the arson and violence.
   The African National Congress and the Northern Areas
Co-ordinating Committee distributed about 3,000 pamphlets Saturday
urging residents to return to work and pupils and teachers to go
back to school Monday. The pamphlet also called on residents to
assist in cleaning up the area.

   The invasion and annexing of their homeland by
Iraq has Kuwaiti students in this country frightened for their
families, confused about the future, and worried about surviving
without money from home.
   Balqees Al-Saleh, who had just graduated from Boston University
and was about to head home to start a career in advertising, said
she faces an uncertain future after the Aug. 2 invasion ordered by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``Ever since I was little, I heard that sometime Saddam is going
to come and take over, and there will be no more Kuwait,'' Al-Saleh
said.
   The primary concern for many Kuwaiti students studying in the
United States is the safety of their loved ones.
   ``I'm just worried about my family. I don't think they're safe.
My people will suffer,'' said Badriah Alqaud, 28, a Kuwaiti whose
husband studies communications at the University of Massachusetts
in Amherst.
   ``You listen to so many people, you don't know what to
believe,'' said Omran Hayat, a 27-year-old graduate civil
engineering student at Northeastern University.
   Hayat was relieved last week to learn his parents, sister and
two brothers had fled Kuwait. They drove across the border into
Saudi Arabia last Tuesday.
   ``They were not excited about leaving, but they felt it was not
safe to stay there,'' Hayat said.
   His parents told him that many Kuwaitis hadn't known about the
pre-dawn invasion and had gone to work as usual. After a day of
house arrest, they were allowed to shop, he said.
   If Iraq remains in Kuwait despite international pressure and the
presence of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf, some Kuwaiti students
here will be cut off from money because of the freeze ordered on
Kuwaiti assets. Most Kuwaiti students study in the U.S. on
government scholarships, according to the Institute of
International Education. The government that provided the
scholarships was been ousted after the invasion.
   Garwood Platt, vice president for external affairs in
international banking at Bank of Boston, said Kuwaiti students
cannot draw money or credit on any account based in Kuwait.
   And that has students worried, said Al-Saleh, 21, one of 16
Kuwaiti students at Boston University.
   Al-Saleh said her parents, who were in Europe at the time of the
invasion, told her a committee is being organized in Europe to
raise money for refugees from Kuwait and students abroad who may
run short of cash.
   ``I am worried I would have to depend on the relief money,'' she
said.
   But she and the other students are mostly concerned about the
safety of their families.
   In Lowell, Geoffrey, Gloria and Gina Lewis said Friday they have
tried unsuccessfully to contact their parents in Kuwait since the
invasion.
   The Lewis siblings, all University of Lowell students, said the
Kuwaiti Embassy told them the phone lines were probably cut.
   Geoffrey said he last spoke to his mother the day of the
invasion.
   ``She told us she could hear fighter planes over her building
and bombs going off,'' he said. ``She was quite worried.''
   The international education institute, a student exchange
association based in New York, said there were 2,280 Kuwaiti
students studying in the United States during the 1989-90 school
year. It is not known how many of them stayed through the summer.
   Institute figures also indicate 4,110 Saudi students studying
here, and 770 Iraqi students. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service said there were 1,403 Iraqi students in the
United States as of Aug. 1.

<BYLINE>The Stranded Americans in Iraq and Kuwait: Hostages or Not?
^By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 3,500 Americans stranded in Kuwait and
Iraq aren't like the American hostages in Lebanon, some of whom
have lived in chains and suffered repeated beatings. Indeed, they
are free to move about, within limits, and have not been mistreated.
   But in other ways, there may be ominous parallels with the
dozens of other U.S. citizens who have fallen prey to
hostage-takers elsewhere in the Middle East over the years.
   And anxious relatives in the United States must cope with
frustration, grief and uncertainty.
   Ten days after the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait, there is a growing
concern that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may be intent on using
the Americans on his turf for political advantage _ much like the
kidnappers in Lebanon. There are about 3,000 Americans in Kuwait
and 580 in Iraq.
   The administration has carefully avoided describing the
Americans as hostages. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a
news conference on Friday that since no demand had been made in
exchange for their freedom, ``we are not calling them hostages.''
   The White House said Saturday that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad
is in almost constant contact with Iraqi authorities over the
Americans. And ironically, if the government called them hostages,
that would preclude negotiations because U.S. policy rules out such
talks with hostage takers.
   But the legalisms are of little comfort to relatives.
   ``They may not be called hostages but in reality they are,''
said the Rev. Edwin Davis of Koran, La., whose daughter and two
grandchildren are trapped. ``We're just waiting, hoping, praying.''
   He has not heard from his daughter since the early hours of the
takeover. The family went to Kuwait to visit a relative.
   ``I'm getting hostile. I'm getting frustrated,'' said Kevin York
of Mount Prospect, Ill., who last spoke to his pregnant wife, Faye,
on July 27. She and her mother, who requires a high blood pressure
medication unavailable in Iraq, were visiting their homeland for
the first time in 15 years at the time of the invasion.
   The Americans were mere bystanders when Saddam's troops invaded
Iraq's small southern neighbor.
   Initially, when queried about the fate of the Americans by U.S.
diplomats, Iraqi authorities gave contradictory answers. But the
Iraqi line seemed to harden last Thursday after President Bush
decided to send military forces to Saudi Arabia.
   The Iraqis formalized what had been a de facto situation,
telling American envoys and other Western diplomats that their
nationals would not be allowed to leave, with the exception of
diplomats and special cases, such as Penelope Nabokov, 10, of
Albany, Calif. She landed in Kuwait unaccompanied last week and
crossed the border into Jordan on Saturday with 10 U.S. diplomats
and dependents of American personnel in Iraq.
   Otherwise, the airports are closed and the borders sealed _ for
Westerners. Arabs and some other non-Westerners, including Indians
and South Koreans, generally have been allowed to depart.
   The Iraqi action left Bush in the uncomfortable position of
seeming to pursue goals that are mutually contradictory. The more
military force he sends to the region to protect Saudi Arabia, the
more vulnerable the stranded Americans become. Protecting those
Americans is one of his four stated goals.
   In almost all ways, the condition of the Americans trapped
inside Iraq and Kuwait is much different from that of traditional
hostages.
   Almost all are free to move about within Kuwaiti and Iraqi
borders. The exceptions are the 38 Americans confined to the Hotel
Rashid in Baghdad. Although they are free to talk with U.S.
consular personnel and have full access to hotel facilities, they
are under armed guard and are forbidden from leaving the grounds.
Almost all were oil workers in Kuwait until 10 days ago.
   While not suffering physical abuse, the Americans in Kuwait and
Iraq are traumatized by uncertainty over what will happen next. To
what lengths is Saddam willing to go in using them for political
advantage? Saddam knows that some of the weapons used against his
forces during Iraq's war against Iran were provided by the United
States as part of a U.S. bid to free hostages in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says Troops Making Saudi Arabia Less Vulnerable</HEAD>

   A ``window of vulnerability'' that might have
allowed Iraq to attack Saudi Arabia has been closed with the quick
deployment of Saudi and U.S. troops, the Saudi ambassador to the
United States said Saturday.
   Prince Bandar Bin Sultan said in an interview that the
``American buildup operation is going well and in certain areas it
is ahead of schedule.''
   The United States is expected to pour as many as 50,000 troops
into Saudi Arabia to defend the oil-rich desert kingdom against a
possible Iraqi invasion. Contingency plans call for as many as
250,000 troops to be sent eventually, depending on whether a grave
Iraqi threat develops.
   The troop deployment followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
Iraq annexed the emirate last Wednesday.
   Bandar said Iraq has seven army divisions with 1,500 tanks in
Kuwait, which lies on the northeastern corner of Saudi Arabia
between that nation and Iraq. But, the ambassador added, the
passing of each day means those troops could be more easily stopped
by the multi-national force.
   ``The window of vulnerability is closing very fast,'' he said.
   So far the multi-national force is comprised primarily of U.S.
and Saudi troops, but Bandar said Egyptian command units arrived
Friday night, Moroccans will arrive Sunday and the Syrians will be
in place soon. In addition, he said, the British will prepare to
handle air defenses and talks are underway with the French about
positioning troops in the area.
   Bandar said an added benefit is the Kuwaiti air force, which he
said has ``been retrieved to Saudi Arabia.''
   Asked how long the multi-national force would need to remain in
Saudi Arabia, Bandar said until ``we all agree there is no more
threat to Saudi Arabia and the Iraqis withdraw from Kuwait.''
   He refused to predict how long that would take, but said he
believed sanctions _ and possibly a blockade _ could affect Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's ability to run his country within the
next 12 weeks.
   Noting that Iraq has serious food shortages and depends on
imported foodstuffs to feed its citizens, Bandar said it will
probably take ``one month to three months before you get really
serious results.''
   Bandar said he didn't believe Saddam had stocked food or
prepared for sanctions because the Iraqi leader didn't expect the
swift international retaliation to his conquest of Kuwait.
   ``I think he is unpredictable and I think he misjudged grossly
the position of the international community,'' Bandar said of
Saddam.
   ``I am very saddened by what he has done to the Arab world,'' he
said.
   But Bandar dismissed Saddam's call for a holy war against
Americans and other foreigners saying the Iraqi president had
always been a secular leader, not a religious leader.
   The ambassador said the presence American troops on Saudi soil
will have ``important implications'' for the cultural and religious
habits of the nation's people, a conservative society that has
worked hard to remain free of foreign influence. However, he said
the Americans have been asked to respect the country's laws and
local customs.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's call for
an Islamic jihad, or holy war, against Saudi Arabia and Western
powers appeared Saturday to have fallen on deaf ears.
   The Arab media generally ignored Saddam's effort to emulate the
legendary Saladin, the Moslem warrior who waged the last great
jihad against a Western invader. Saladin fought and defeated the
Crusaders almost 800 years ago.
   The strongest evidence that Saddam's ploy was fizzling was the
decision by key Arab states, notably Egypt and Syria, at a Friday
emergency meeting of the Arab League, to send troops to Saudi
Arabia to help protect it against Iraqi troops massing on the
border.
   Saddam was only supported by the Palestine Liberation
Organization and Libya. Pro-Iraqi demonstrations were reported in
Libya, Yemen and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Many Arabs are convinced that the reason for Saddam's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait were to further his political ambitions to
become the leader of the Arab world and to seize the emirate's oil
fields to bolster his economy.
   They scoffed at any suggestion that Saddam, whose socialist
government has shown scant religious fervor in the past, was
seeking to further Islam by conquering an Arab state which observed
the faith more strictly than his country.
   ``It's a struggle for economic interests, greed and a desire by
Saddam to impose hegemony,'' said Persian Gulf merchant Nabil
Ibrahim.
   ``Involving religion in this is an extremely dangerous risk. The
call for jihad is certainly irrational, an act of despair that will
go unheeded.''
   The Arab troops being despatched to Saudi Arabia will join a
major buildup by the United States, backed by several of its
allies, to protect the oil fields that are vital to the
industrialized world.
   ``It's a pity that Saudi Arabia had to turn to non-Moslem powers
to help defend its holy land,'' said one Riyadh-based Egyptian
diplomat who, under his embassy rules, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``But it was Saddam, not Fahd, who brought the Americans to
Saudi Arabia,'' he said. ``It would be stupid to say that the
Americans have any designs on Islam. Saddam's call for jihad is
simply empty of any serious implications.''
   President Bush rejected Saddam's call for jihad as a ``frantic
ploy'' by a despot condemned by most of the Arab world.
   But Saddam's call has found support among some Arabs.
   In Yemen, thousands of Yemenis demonstrated outside the U.S.,
Saudi and Egyptian embassies. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank,
Palestinians waving Iraqi flags responed to Saddam's call for a
jihad and protested the moves to counter Saddam's annexation of
Kuwait. There were reports of a pro-Iraq demonstration in Libya.
   Literally, jihad means struggle. According to the Koran, Islam's
holy book, every Moslem is duty bound to struggle to spread his
faith, preferably by peaceful means. Violence is only to be used as
a last resort.
   Islam's spectacular expansion throughout the Middle East and
beyond to Spain and the borders of China shortly after the religion
was founded in the 6th century was attributed primarily to Moslems'
fanatical willingness to wage a holy war.
   Theoretically, Moslems are in a constant state of jihad. Many
modern Moslem scholars insist that jihad automatically becomes a
state of war only when the faith is threatened, which none see as
the case now.
   Saddam's attempt to rally Moslems against the United States is
not without irony.
   According to the Koran, Christians and Jews are accorded special
treatment. Known as ``scriptuaries'' because they believe in God
but not Islam's prophet Mohammed, they have the choice of
converting to Islam, retaining their faith but paying a tax, or
being fought like other infidels.
   A call for a universal jihad earlier this century was a total
failure. In 1914, Sultan Mohammed Rashad of Turkey decreed a holy
war against the West, apparently at the instigation of his German
allies.
   But the millions of Arabs ruled by the Turks in the Ottoman
Empire ignored that appeal and two years later, during World War I,
they rose in revolt against the Turks.
   Saladin's jihad in 1186 against the Crusaders, who had wrested
control of Jerusalem from the Moslems 90 years before, remains the
most successful such holy war.
   Saladin, a Kurd, crossed the Jordan River to recapture Jerusalem
in 1187.

   Iraq warned its people Saturday that
anyone caught buying or selling food on the black market will be
executed, indicating it is preparing for the economic sanctions
imposed after the invasion of Kuwait.
   President Saddam Hussein and his ruling Revolution Command
Council met and said that ``any manipulation of food supplies for
trading purposes will be considered a crime and a sabotage act
infringing national security.''
   ``The perpetrators will receive the death penalty and all their
assets, in cash or property, will be confiscated,'' the council
said in a statement carried by Baghdad radio and monitored in
Cyprus.
   The radio said the decision was taken to ``thwart the economic
blockade with God's help'' to ``provide enough foodstuffs to all
citizens and foil the cheats and the greedy ones.''
   The warning indicated Saddam is preparing his people for
possible hardships caused by the U.N.'s mandatory ban on food
supplies to Iraq to punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait on Aug. 2
and later annexing it.
   So far it is not clear whether one of Iraq's neighbors, Jordan,
will comply with the ban. A possible loophole in the sanctions
resolution allows imports ``for humanitarian purposes.''
   Iraq imports $2 billion worth of food a year, and food was
already rationed in Iraq before the invasion.
   Basic supplies such as rice, sugar and cooking oil are purchased
at government-run stores, and lines stretch the length of city
blocks.
   The state-run radio reported demonstrations as the ``enraged
Baghdad masses'' mobbed the Saudi Arabian and Egyptian embassies to
denounce them for helping bring ``U.S. and Zionist troops'' into
Saudi Arabia.
   Earlier, the radio claimed that Israeli troops and planes were
in Saudi Arabia. Israel has denied similar Iraqi claims in the past.
   The radio said the protesters ``chanted death to the enemies of
Iraq and the Arab nation, the inheritors of colonialist doctrine
and protectors of Zionism who are protecting their thrones with the
bayonets of foreign troops.''
   Arriving in Baghdad from Cairo, Deputy Prime Minister Taha
Yassin Ramadan said his delegation told Arab leaders at an
emergency summit there on Friday that Iraq did not fear foreign
threats.
   Ramadan said his country's ``strike capabilities could shake and
burn any spot from which aggression was launched,'' the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
   The Arab leaders decided to send an Arab force to Saudi Arabia
to defend it from possible attack by Iraq, which has massed
thousands of soldiers on Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia.
   Twelve of the 21 members of the Arab League voted to send troops.
   Ramadan said the conference was biased against Iraq from the
beginning and its resolutions were decided in advance, the news
agency said. He said the summit had been ``prepared to give the
green light to the imperialist and Zionist forces, to launch
aggression against Iraq and the Arab nation.''
   Baghdad radio said league members who voted to send troops into
Saudi Arabia were more interested in doing what the United States
asked than finding a reconciliation formula.
   ``The emirs of oil and their servant (Egyptian President) Hosni
Mubarak insisted on what America demanded of them,'' said a radio
commentary, also monitored in Cyprus.
   On Friday, Saddam urged the people of Egypt and the Persian Gulf
states to revolt against their governments and join Iraq in a holy
war against the West and its allies in the region.
   Iraq's ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party was formed on secular
lines, but Saddam began paying more attention to Islam because of
attacks on his beliefs by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of
Iran during the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war, a conflict that
established the reputation of Iraq's formidable army.

   Children whose parents are going through a divorce
are learning to cope through a program that includes puppets, a
board game and a mock television show that lets the kids play
divorce experts, researchers say.
   The program works for children in kindergarten through sixth
grade, using different teaching activities for different ages, said
JoAnne Pedro-Carroll.
   ``Divorce need not result in inevitable long-term trauma for
children,'' said Pedro-Carroll, director of the program at the
University of Rochester in New York.
   Studies with some 400 children of divorce show improvement in a
variety of areas, including solving day-to-day problems,
communicating with relatives, coping with family changes, getting
along with schoolmates and completing schoolwork, researchers said.
   The children said they were less anxious, less likely to blame
themselves for the divorce and less worried about family
circumstances, researchers said.
   Pedro-Carroll and colleague Linda Alpert-Gillis, both clinical
psychologists, spoke in interviews before describing the program
Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological
Association.
   The program is ``the best stuff out there'' for working directly
with children of divorce, commented Arizona State University
researcher Irwin Sandler.
   A complementary approach that involves parents who have custody
of a child is also showing success, he said.
   The Rochester program is carried out in school over 12 to 16
weeks, with four or five children to a group in kindgergarten
through third grade, and five to eight for fourth- through
sixth-graders.
   One major goal is to teach problem-solving skills. Older
children describe problems in their lives, discuss solutions and
try them out in impromptu skits in which they may play themselves,
then a parent. After trying out a solution they report back on
results.
   In this way, Pedro-Carroll said, one boy was able to persuade
his mother to let him spend Father's Day weekend with his father.
``It gave him a sense of control,'' she said.
   Children also are taught to identify and avoid focusing on
problems they cannot solve, she said.
   ``Worrying about what's happening in court between Mom and Dad,
or the support payments, those are very adult issues'' that
distract a child from schoolwork and the normal activities of being
a child, Pedro-Carroll said.
   Using a board game that involves throwing dice, moving a marker
and picking up a card that presents a problem, children discuss
what issues they can and cannot solve.
   The program also aims to teach children to identify and express
their feelings. Lacking an adult's thinking and language skills, a
child may convert unexpressed feelings into headaches or stomach
aches, Pedro-Carroll said.
   Even kindergartners can be taught to ask a parent for more time
together rather than whining or clinging, she said.
   Puppets that act out a child's feelings let younger children
more easily discuss their own experiences at home, she said.
   Older children review lessons of the program by taking turns as
divorce experts on a mock television show, in which they answer
questions posed by group leaders.
   ``You can see how that could really empower kids with a sense of
efficacy ... and competence,'' said Arizona State's Sandler.
   On an emotional level, the program is designed to help children
feel good about themselves and their families. It stresses that
``all families don't have to have two parents living together,''
said Alpert-Gillis. ``Families are people who love you, and each
family is unique and special.''
   The groups provide a place for children ``to find out they're
not alone, they're not the only ones who have the feelings they've
been struggling with,'' Pedro-Carroll said.

<TEXT>
   Rebel forces moved to within 200
yards of Monrovia's airport Saturday, and the government announced
it had arrested an American and accused him of supporting the
insurgents.
   The fighting Saturday came on the third day of an offensive
aimed at driving President Samuel Doe from power before a West
African force arrives to try to end the 7-month-old civil war.
   The fighting forced officials to begin evacuating the last
operating hospital in Monrovia on Saturday, a Western relief
official said.
   Fifty rebels of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front,
supported by 60mm mortars and a 200mm anti-aircraft gun, met stiff
resistance from government troops using small arms to defend
Spriggs Payne airfield.
   No flights have been reported for several weeks at the airport,
which is two miles from Doe's fortified mansion. Taylor launched
his offensive on Wednesday from Paynesville, a suburb on the
eastern outskirts of Monrovia.
   In a radio telephone call from Doe's mansion to the British
Broadcasting Corp., a presidential spokesman said the arrested
American man was armed with a U.S.-made M-16 rifle and a loaded
revolver when he was apprehended Friday in an apartment building in
eastern Sinkor suburb.
   He was tentatively identified as Andrew Voros of New Jersey, but
the BBC reporter who took the call said the line was poor and it
was difficult to understand the statement. The spokesman, whose
name was not audible, accused the American of carrying out ``rebel
activities.'' Arrested with him was a Liberian army officer
identifed as Col. Christopher Doe, who was accused of working for
the CIA. He is not related to President Doe.
   In Washington, the State Department said the American was
arrested at a guest house of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the government agency that administers the U.S. aid
program worldwide.
   Doe's spokesman said the U.S. Embassy had been informed of the
arrest.
   The State Department said U.S. officials had been in contact
with Doe's aides but had received no response about what they
planned to do with the man. The official refused to identify him by
name because he was a private citizen.
   On Aug. 5, more than 200 Marines were airlifted to Monrovia to
evacuate Americans and other foreigners. The Marines have since
taken up defensive positions in the U.S. Embassy compound. The rest
of the 2,100 Marines sent to Liberia are on U.S. warships cruising
off Liberia's coast.
   Washington has said repeatedly that the Marines in Liberia are
there only to protect U.S. citizens and installations and will not
intervene to halt the war in the country founded by freed American
slaves in 1847.
   West Germany said on Saturday it has decided to close its
embassy in Liberia. Bonn said it has contacted the United States
about the best way to evacuate its 10 people and about 100 refugees
and has asked Taylor to allow the evacuees to pass through
territory he controls on their way out of the country.
   The rebel advance comes as a five-nation West African
peacekeeping force was mobilizing to sail to Monrovia from
Freetown, capital of neighboring Sierra Leone. A contingent of 100
Nigerian troops arrived in Freetown by air Saturday.
   Three Nigerian ships are waiting in Freetown to carry soldiers
to Monrovia. Gambia announced it was sending a token company of 120
soldiers. Gambia has less than 1,000 soldiers and most are fighting
a rebel insurgency.
   Hundreds of troops also have massed on Liberia's eastern border
with Sierra Leone and armored tank divisions on the northern border
with Guinea.
   Doe and Prince Johnson, a rival rebel leader whose troops
already are in downtown Monrovia, have welcomed news of the West
African force. The peacekeepers have orders to fight to enforce a
truce, if need be.
   Taylor has opposed West African calls for a cease-fire, which
were echoed Friday by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   Saturday's fighting forced doctors at St. Joseph's Catholic
Hospital, which was only 500 yards behind the front, to begin
evacuating the 500 wounded civilians and rebel troops they have
been caring for.
   ``(A rebel commander) told me we had to evacuate the hospital
because of the danger of shelling,'' said Dr. Johan Heffinck of the
Belgrian humanitarian group Doctors Without Border.
   ``Those who could walk have already begun trying to make their
way back to safer area. The rest, about 80 more severely wounded,
will be evacuated to'' another hospital outside the city, he said.
   He left with the patients in a 40-vehicle convoy after winning
assurances from rebels that it would not be attacked. St. Joseph's
was the last operating hospital in the besieged city.
   ``During the last three or four days it has been terrible here
with shelling and firing the whole day almost,'' Heffinck said.
``We couldn't even work anymore. It is impossible to continue now.''

<HEAD>Murder Trial Of Alleged Cult Leader To Begin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAINESVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors pooh-poohed a poll showing
it's impossible to find an unbiased jury to hear the case against a
reputed cult leader charged with killing a family of five.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 40, a defrocked lay minister, is charged with
five counts of aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping in
connection with the deaths of two followers, Dennis and Cheryl
Avery, and their three daughters. He could face the death penalty.
   The trial is due to start Monday with questioning of prospective
jurors.
   The Averys' bodies were found buried in January on a farm in
Kirtland, about 30 miles east of Cleveland. Prosecutors contend the
Averys were led one by one into a barn on April 17, 1989, bound and
blindfolded with duct tape, then shot to death and buried in a
common grave under the barn.
   Lundgren's wife, Alice, was convicted Aug. 1 on 15 counts of
kidnapping and complicity and conspiracy to commit aggravated
murder. Five other cult members have pleaded guilty to reduced
charges and may be called to testify against Lundgren.
   Defense attorney Paul LaPlante had sought a change of venue for
Lundgren's trial, citing among other things the results of a
telephone survey conducted by Jack Arbuthnot, a psychology
professor at Ohio University in Athens, asking people whether they
have heard of Lundgren and his purported cult.
   ``I have conducted a telephone survey which indicates there is
no potential juror in Lake County who doesn't know something about
the case,'' LaPlante said.
   He said 201 people were called and ``only one person claimed not
to know something about it, and I question that.'' The survey also
indicated that 70 percent of the respondents wanted Lundgren put to
death.
   But prosecutor Steven LaTourette said an impartial jury can be
found, although it could take more than a week.
   In an affidavit filed by prosecutors Friday, Ohio State
University psychologist Jon A. Krosnick dismissed the defense
survey as biased and unprofessional.
   LaPlante agreed the survey may be flawed, but said that did not
change the fact there has been enormous publicity about the case.
   Lundgren is a defrocked lay minister of the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The church, based in
Independence, Mo., is separate from the Salt Lake City-based Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, although both draw from the
book of Mormon.
   After Lundgren came to Kirtland from Independence in 1984, he
began teaching Sunday school and giving tours of the church's
historic temple there. Others joined Lundgren in Ohio.
   The Rev. Dale Luffman, pastor of Kirtland's Reorganized Church,
said Lundgren became critical of the church's leaders, especially
after the Reorganized Church approved ordaining female ministers.
   Luffman said Lundgren began seeing himself as a prophet and
recruiting followers. The church defrocked him in 1988, and he and
his 12 members _ including his wife and their 19-year-old son,
Damon _ lived and worshiped at the farm. Damon Lundgren faces the
same charges as his father.
   Dennis Avery, 49; Cheryl Avery, 42; and daughters Trina, 15;
Rebecca, 13; and Karen, 7; also were members of the group but not
as fervent as the others, authorities have said. They did not live
on the farm but in nearby Madison Township.
   Shortly after the arrests, Kirtland Police Chief Dennis
Yarborough said there was speculation the Averys had been killed as
a ``soul-cleansing'' sacrifice before the group headed to West
Virginia to find God.

<HEAD>Study Estimates Half Of Priests Violate Celibacy Rule</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Archbishop Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to half of Roman Catholic priests in the United
States do not uphold their vows of celibacy, according to estimates
from a 25-year study by a former Catholic priest who is now a
psychotherapist.
   A. W. Richard Sipe told a forum at the American Psychological
Association meeting Saturday that his study indicated 20 percent of
priests ``have a clear pattern of heterosexual behavior,'' 10
percent to 13 percent are homosexually active and 6 percent are
involved sexually with minors.
   The study, carried out between 1960 and 1985, is not a random
scientific survey, but involved extrapolations from interviews with
about 1,500 people. One-third were priests who were undergoing
psychotherapy, a third were priests who shared their stories in
workshops or informal settings and a third were lovers or others
with firsthand knowledge of priests' sexual behavior.
   The Rev. Kenneth Doyle, a spokesman for the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops, criticized the study for not gathering data
from a random sample. He said the study relied heavily on priests
who sought counseling for sexual problems.
   Dean Hoge, a sociology professor at the Catholic University of
America, said estimates are all that is available on the subject.
   ``A topic like this is impossible to measure with any precision
because it is so confidential,'' Hoge said. ``Nobody will know the
facts. It's too sensitive.''
   Sipe is a lecturer in the psychiatry department of the Johns
Hopkins University medical school in Baltimore, and conducts a
private family-therapy practice. He left the priesthood in 1970 to
get married.
   He said his estimates are the ``best numbers'' available on the
sexual activity of priests.
   ``The point is, whether it's scientific or not, you can validate
a lot from experience,'' he said in an interview Saturday.
   The findings will be detailed in a book, ``A Secret World:
Sexuality and the Search for Celibacy,'' being published next month
by Brunner-Mazel of New York City.
   While half of priests generally support the idea of celibacy,
only 2 percent fully achieve it, Sipe said. About 6 percent to 8
percent of priests adhere to celibacy despite past reversals.
   About 40 percent ``are practicing it sufficently well enough to
be called celibate,'' Sipe said. ``They have the possibility of
future celibate consolidation, yet at the same time unresolved
personal and spiritual issues make their practice tenuous enough to
allow for non-celibate exploration.''
   Up to 23 percent of Catholic priests have a homosexual
orientation, Sipe estimated, and half of that group are sexually
active. He also said, at any one time, 20 percent of priests are
involved in ``a non-celibate relationship with a woman or have a
clear pattern of heterosexual behavior.''
   An additional 6 percent to 8 percent of priests who are
heterosexual ``experiment with non-celibacy,'' and 6 percent are
involved sexually with minors, he said.
   Five percent of priests were described as involved in
``problematic sexual activity'' such as ``pornography and
compulsive masturbation'' and 1 percent in transvestism, or
cross-dressing, Sipe said.
   Sipe said that clerical celibacy has been shrouded in secrecy.
   ``In all sexual matters, the whole muscle tone of Roman Catholic
moral authority has been enfeebled by the avoidance of legitimate
discussion and controversy and by the authoritarian reliance on
pronouncement rather than on reason,'' he said.
   The Rev. Tom O'Connor of the Institute of Religious Research at
Loyola College in Baltimore, said it is hard to guess how many
priests break their vows of celibacy, ``but there's certainly a lot
of problems around sexuality.''
   Once the ``sensational'' aspects of the study are put in
perspective, Hoge said, ``A little more open discussion of this, I
think, would serve everyone well.''
   There were 53,222 priests in the United States in 1988,
according to the Official Catholic Directory.

   President Paul Biya ordered the release
of an unspecified number of political prisoners Saturday, including
a prominent lawyer who was imprisoned after attending meetings in
support of multiparty democracy.
   The release of the prisoners followed Biya's pledge to lift
restrictions on opposition parties in the West African nation.
   Pressure for the right to organize opposition parties erupted
into violence in May when police clashed with demonstrators, and
six were shot dead.
   One of those ordered freed was Yondo Mandengue Black. Amnesty
International had protested the conviction of Yondo, a former
president of the Cameroon Bar Association. He was sentenced to
three years in jail for threatening state security.
   Also ordered freed was company director Anicet Ekane.
   Amnesty had called the trial of the two last April by a military
court ``a travesty of justice.''
   ``There was no convincing evidence to justify their conviction
and details of the charges were withheld from the defendants
throughout the trial,'' it said. One of the defendants' lawyers was
killed at police roadblock on the last day of the trial.

   Four months ago, 22-year-old Pamela Smart
was a popular teacher who seemed to have a grand future with her
husband of less than a year. Now, she sits alone in a prison cell,
accused of talking a 16-year-old student at her school into
shooting her husband to death.
   Gregory Smart, 24, was found dead in the couple's Derry
apartment, a single bullet in his head, on May 1 _ just six days
before their first wedding anniversary.
   ``I think about what our dreams were, and those will never
happen,'' Mrs. Smart said days after the murder. ``But I'm still
alive and I still have dreams. I will try to go forward and do
those things.''
   On Aug. 1, though, she was arrested and charged her with
plotting her husband's murder. She is being held at the state
prison for women in Goffstown, awaiting a bail hearing Monday.
   If convicted on the accomplice-to-murder charge, Mrs. Smart will
face life in jail without parole.
   A police affidavit alleges that Mrs. Smart was in love with
someone else and wished to have an affair with him, but did not
want to do so until after Gregory's death. So, police say, she
instructed a 16-year-old Seabrook boy, identified by authorities as
a Winnacunnet Regional High School student named ``William F.,'' to
kill her husband.
   William F. was one of three Seabrook teens arrested in June on
juvenile charges related to the killing. Because of their ages, few
details of their cases have been released, including how the other
two boys allegedly got involved in the plot.
   But William is alleged to be one who pulled the trigger while a
second youth held Smart down; a third is alleged to have driven the
getaway car. Prosecutors say they will try to have all three tried
as adults on charges of murder and accomplice to first-degree
murder.
   Mrs. Smart knew the boys as a teacher of video and media for the
Winnacunnet Regional School District.
   The night of the murder, Mrs. Smart had to work late at a school
board meeting, finding her husband's body when she returned home.
When police arrived, they found the apartment had been ransacked
and the couple's dog locked in the basement.
   But the next day, Derry police Capt. Loring Jackson said he
doubted the crime was a random attack or a bungled burglary.
   Mrs. Smart insisted her husband must have surprised a burglar.
She went on television soon afterward to ask for help in finding
the culprit.
   After the teen-agers were arrested, Mrs. Smart was angered by
speculation that, because she knew the boys, she must somehow be
involved.
   She acknowledged that she had gone to the home of one of the
arrested boys on several occasions to work on a school video, and
that she had invited him to her house once. But she denied any
connection to the murder.
   ``People are treating me like I'm the big link between the kids
and Greg's murder,'' she said. ``But what about the thousands of
other videos I did for the kids in the school system? That's my job.
   ``Why doesn't anyone treat me like the victim?''
   Mrs. Smart's relatives and friends have mostly rallied around
her, insisting on her innocence and describing her as a loving wife.
   ``You have to understand, they dated for three years before they
got married,'' said John Wojas Jr., Mrs. Smart's younger brother.
``Greg was smart enough to know who he was marrying.''
   Judith Smart, Gregory's mother, said that although the couple's
marriage appeared problem-free, she now has doubts.
   ``Looking back, some things just didn't seem right,'' she said.
``It's starting to sink in that, yes, she probably is involved.
   ``It hurts because I know how much Greg loved her, and he
wouldn't believe what's happening now.''

   Leoluca Orlando, known as the
``anti-Mafia'' mayor for his crusade against Sicilian organized
crime, resigned on Saturday after political squabbling among his
supporters.
   Orlando came to international fame in 1986, when 400 defendants
were brought to trial in Palermo in the largest anti-Mafia trial
ever held.
   Among his innovations were his insistence that all holders of
city public works contracts be screened to make sure they had no
ties to the Mafia and that the contracts go to public bids to avoid
corruption.
   Orlando, a Christian Democrat, was elected by the city council
last month for a second term following local administrative
elections in May. A champion of the Christian Democrat's left wing,
he was also backed by the environmental Greens and the Communists.
   Political squabbling among his supporters led to his
resignation, news reports said.

   A leftist Moslem militia leader said
Saturday he expected Swiss hostage Elio Erriquez to be freed
shortly.
   Erriquez, 24, was kidnapped Oct. 6 in front of an International
Red Cross artificial limbs center in Sidon, along with co-worker
Emanuel Christen, 33. Christen was freed Wednesday.
   Mustafa Saad, head of the Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia that
has governed Sidon since the 1975 outbreak of Lebanon's civil war,
told reporters in Sidon: ``I believe Erriquez will be released
soon.''
   He declined to elaborate, or to specify when the release might
be.
   Saad was instrumental in negotiating previous releases of
hostages connected to humanitarian organizations in Sidon, a port
city 25 miles south of Beirut.
   The terse statement came four days after a group calling itself
the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads handed Christen over to Syria.
   The group had said in a statement released Tuesday that it would
free both Christian and Erriquez within 24 hours. But only Christen
was set free on Wednesday.
   The release of Christen, who flew home from the Syrian capital
of Damascus on Thursday, left 15 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon.
   In addition to Erriquez, they are six Americans, four Britons,
two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Most are believed held by extremist factions under the umbrella
of the Shiite Moslem fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God,
Iran's main ally in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Meanwhile, a previously unknown group calling itself the Eagles
of the Tempest threatened to retaliate Saturday for any Western
military action against Iraq.
   ``We warn all those who let themselves be seduced into thinking
of a military action against Iraq that they have citizens,
interests and hostages in Lebanon,'' said the statement, which was
delivered to Western news agencies in Beirut.
   ``We shall not let the whole world rest as long as our nation is
in danger,'' the statement added. ``Our nation'' is believed to be
a reference to the Arab people.
   The name used by the group suggests it belongs to the Syrian
Social Nationalist Party, a leftist Lebanese group that advocates
the merger of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, pre-Israel
Palestine and Cyprus into a greater Syria.
   The group supports Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion and
annexation of Kuwait even though they are pro-Syrian.
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main power
broker in that country. Syria has strongly condemned the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Magellan's Venus Exploration May Provide Clues to the Early Earth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geologists may get a glimpse of what
Earth's surface was like a few billion years ago when the Magellan
spacecraft's radar pierces the clouds of Venus to reveal secrets of
an alien terrain.
   ``Venus is the last of the inner planets we are exploring in
detail, and probably is the most important from the point of view
of understanding the Earth,'' said Jim Head, a member of NASA's
Magellan science team and a geology professor at Brown University
in Providence, R.I.
   Magellan fired its braking rocket and slipped into orbit around
Venus on Friday after a 15-month, 948-million-mile voyage from
Earth.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory monitored the
spacecraft's health Saturday so it will be ready by Sept. 1 to use
its radar to peer through thick Venusian clouds and make the most
detailed pictures and maps yet of the planet's landscape.
   Magellan entered orbit so smoothly that it used very little
thruster fuel to point it properly while the rocket fired. So
Magellan weighs more and moves faster than expected, making the low
point in its orbit 183 miles above Venus instead of 171 miles as
planned, said navigation chief John McNamee.
   The orbit is so good that an adjustment maneuver planned for
Aug. 28 will not be needed, Magellan project manager Tony Spear
said Saturday.
   Magellan is designed to study the geology and geography of
Venus, heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a ``greenhouse effect''
gone berserk.
   Venus' high temperature and crushing atmospheric pressure might
make rock in the planet's crust much thinner and more flexible than
Earth's, Head said.
   So Venus may resemble Earth before our home planet's crust
cooled off and broke into colossal plates. Those plates now drift
across the face of the Earth, moving whole continents and colliding
to uplift mountain ranges and trigger volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes.
   Most of Earth's original surface was destroyed long ago by
erosion and plate movements, so ``we have grave difficulty
answering fundamental questions about the early history of the
Earth,'' Head said.
   While Venus is hot, dry and lifeless, ``it is very similar in
size and density and also is the closest planet to the Earth,'' he
said. ``That means it probably had the most similar conditions when
the planets formed (4.6 billion years ago). So if we want to study
another planet to learn something about the early Earth, Venus is a
good candidate.''
   Learning how Venus' crust moves and is deformed ``will tell us a
lot more about the Earth,'' said Steve Saunders, NASA's chief
scientist for Magellan.
   Magellan may settle debate over competing theories that seek to
explain the creation of Venus' continent-like highlands, which
include Africa-sized Aphrodite Terra, Australia-sized Ishtar Terra
and Hawaii-like Beta Regio.
   Saunders believes ``hot spots'' of rising molten rock created
the highlands, just as hot spots created Hawaii on Earth.
   ``If you could look at a time-lapse movie over billions of
years, it might look like a big pot of thick porridge simmering,'
Saunders said, adding Venus' crust may feature ``a bunch of big
Hawaiis all over the place.''
   Some other scientists think Venus' highlands are big pieces of
crust that solidified first as the planet's initial molten surface
cooled off.
   But Head believes plate movements formed the highlands.
Aphrodite Terra resembles Earth's midocean ridges, the undersea
mountain ranges where molten rock emerges to add new material to
the drifting plates of crust.
   Ishtar Terra ``has many of the features that you would expect
where blocks of crust are colliding,'' including volcanoes such as
those along the Pacific coasts of Alaska and South America and
folded mountain belts such as Earth's Himalayas, which were created
because India is smashing into Asia.
   Even if the Venusian crust hasn't yet broken into plates, ``we
probably will find faults like the San Andreas in California,'' a
pretty sure sign that ``Venusquakes'' shake the second planet from
the sun, Saunders said.

   Here is a transcript of the news
conference given Saturday by President Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III on Baker's diplomatic mission and other
developments in the Middle East.
   BUSH: Well let me just say that we've had a very good briefing,
update from the secretary of state. I thanked him for the success
of his diplomatic mission, a very important trip to our good friend
President Ozal of Turkey. And Jim filled me in on the details of
that Turkish leg, and then of course I'm so pleased that the NATO
alliance is together, and that we're in accord on the _ how to look
at the problems in the Middle East.
   And I think every single member of NATO is in accord with the
economic plan. And so it was a good trip, and I'm very grateful to
Secretary Baker just on the heels of this long swing to come back
up here and brief us. I filled him in on four phone calls I had
today: President Mubarak, King Fahd and then two other Arab
countries, and I _ I think things are moving in the right direction.
   We're pleased so far with the solidarity, cohesiveness of the
economic actions that have been taken. So I'd be glad to take one
or two questions, and I know the secretary would too.
   Q. Mr. President, did President Mubarak say that Egyptian troops
would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops in Saudi
Arabia?
   BUSH: Well he _ did who say that?
   Q. Did President Mubarak tell you Egyptian troops will be on the
ground next to ours in Saudi Arabia?
   BUSH: Well he made clear that they're willing to do their share,
and yes, that they will be there.
   Q. When will they be there?
   BUSH: Well, I don't have the exact time on that, but they will
do their share and so will other Arab countries. And I think we've
been saying all along, or indicating all along that indeed this
would be a multilateral force, and it would be a multilateral force
with some Arab components. And that's exactly the way it's working
out. And I think that's a good -- I think that sends a very good
signal.
   Yeah.

<HEAD>Squealing Computers May Be Source of Stress, Researchers Say</HEAD>

   Women afflicted by headaches and tension
at the office should not automatically blame the boss. The source
of the irritation may be a high-frequency, barely audible squeal
from their computers.
   Two researchers believe they have linked noise made by video
display terminals with stress symptoms in women, who hear
high-frequency sounds better than men.
   ``The sound is present in almost all American computers,'' said
Dr. Caroline Dow, assistant professor of communication at the
University of Evansville. ``We can all work through that sound, but
it is tiring and distracting.''
   The sound might be compared to the cry of a rabbit caught in a
trap, said Dow's husband, Dr. Douglas Covert.
   ``This squeal, to a mother, is a distress call,'' Dow said.
   Dow and Covert, also an assistant professor of communication at
the university, were to present their findings Sunday at the
national convention of the Association for Education in Journalism
and Mass Communications in Minneapolis.
   Dow noticed the effects while working in a computer laboratory
at another university.
   ``These computers bugged me,'' she said. ``I was very, very
strung out. Sometimes I could hear it and sometimes I couldn't.''
   The couple's studies show women can be affected by the noise
even when they can't consciously hear it, she said.
   But men are rarely bothered, because most of them cannot hear
the 16-kilohertz pure-tone sound at all, she said. Men generally
cannot hear frequencies above 15 kHz, while women can hear up to 18
kHz, Dow said.
   Such pure tones are more distressing than the broad-range sounds
people more commonly hear in their environment, she said.
   Dow and Covert became interested in computer noise after
observing headaches, fatigue and irritability in female students
working with classroom computers.
   In the fall of 1987 they came to the University of Evansville,
which agreed to support their research.
   In their first test in April 1987, 41 students were asked to do
clerical tasks in a room where the sound was created at about the
level of normal conversation.
   ``What we found was they speeded up and doubled their errors
(when exposed to the sound),'' Dow said. ``Those are symptoms of
high stress.''
   In March 1990, the couple set up a second test using 100 female
students. The group was asked to spend a morning taking the
Graduate Record Exam, half of them working while exposed to the
tone.
   ``The experimental group did anywhere from 8 percent to 9.5
percent worse than the control group,'' Dow said.
   The couple said they hope their research will be duplicated and
expanded by other researchers. They wonder if further study could
link the noise with miscarriages and other health problems linked
to computers.
   In the meantime, there is some relief for people who find the
tone irritating, Dow said.
   Switching to a high-definition monitor should solve the problem.
Those monitors operate at twice the frequency, producing a noise
well above the human hearing range.
   When noisy monitors can't be avoided, foam ear plugs can offer
temporary relief by reducing the intensity of high-pitched sounds
without affecting ordinary conversation.

   The refugees walk in single file. The
only sounds are bare feet slapping softly, the scuffle of shoes
soaked by the constant rain _ and the crackle of gunfire.
   At any moment, they can be pulled out of the long line and shot
_ if the rebels fighting to oust President Samuel Doe suspect them
of being former government soldiers. Summary executions are common.
   The faces of the refugees in Congo Town, an eastern suburb of
the Liberian capital, are drained of emotion. They rarely speak,
stepping impassively across the bodies littering the roadside.
   Every question _ Where are you from? Where are you going? What
has happened to you? _ draws the same response.
   ``I don't know,'' they murmur, if they answer at all. ``I don't
know.''
   One man pushes a wheelbarrow holding a white-haired old man, who
bounces among burlap bags stuffed with belongings.
   Tens of thousands of refugees have fled the capital's eastern
suburbs since the rebels began closing in on Doe's executive
mansion.
   It is a last-ditch bid to oust Liberia's leader of 10 years
before the arrival of more than 2,000 West African peacekeepers who
have orders to enforce a truce, by force if necessary.
   Most of those fleeing had been trapped behind government lines
and were only able to move after the rebels advanced and the
fighting moved past them.
   All the men, especially younger ones, risk arrest if they are
suspected of being government deserters or members of Doe's Krahn
tribe, who can be identified by their tribal language.
   Most of those displaced by the fighting make their way toward a
temporary refugee camp set up at the University of Liberia's Fendel
campus, 12 miles northeast of Monrovia.
   An estimated 180,000 people have crowded into the camp, which
has no water, little food and no means of caring for the new
arrivals.
   Another 400,000 Liberians already have fled the 7-month-old war
to neighboring states. Thousands of others are displaced elsewhere
in the country.
   Journalists who visited the Fendel camp report the rebels
provide rice from time to time, but the fighters eat first.
   The only help for the refugees comes from 12 doctors and eight
nurses of the Belgian branch of the humanitarian organization
Doctors Without Borders.
   On Saturday, they evacuated St. Joseph's Hospital in Congo Town,
where they had been caring for 500 civilians, government soldiers
and rebels wounded in the fighting. It was the last operating
hospital in the war-torn city.
   Most of the patients were well enough to walk. But about 80
seriously wounded people were taken in a convoy of 40 vehicles to
the town of Gbarnga, about 100 miles northeast of Monrovia, where
the doctors plan to set up at another hospital.
   Life in Liberia is so hard that even war-battered Lebanon looks
like a safe haven. A group of 152 Lebanese refugees arrived in
Beirut Saturday after a 48-hour overland journey from Liberia to
Sierra Leone. They flew to Beirut aboard a chartered Middle East
Airlines jet.
   Ali Matar, who has lived in Monrovia for the past 10 years, told
reporters the war had left the country devastated.
   ``There is no water, no food supplies,'' he said. ``Fighting was
so ferocious that we had to stay indoors for more than 20 days. And
since there are no underground shelters, our lives were in danger.''
   He said a convoy of 46 cars carrying about 222 Lebanese left
Liberia for Sierra Leone early Tuesday and arrived two days later.
Matar said another group of 70 Lebanese was expected in Beirut
Sunday.

   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Thousands of demonstrators on Saturday
staged pro-Iraqi protests in front of several embassies in the
Yemeni capital and smashed the windows of the U.S. mission,
witnesses said.
   Rallies in Yemen and elsewhere were to show support for Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and express opposition to Arab and Western
military intervention to protect Iraq's oil-rich neighbor Saudi
Arabia.
   In several Jordanian towns and cities, protesters denounced the
United States and hailed the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait. In Irbid,
50 miles north of Amman, a crowd of about 3,000 people chanted
pro-Iraqi slogans and speakers denounced Arab leaders who agreed to
send troops to Saudi Arabia as traitors.
   Similar rallies were also staged in Jordan's sprawling
Palestinian refugee camp of Baqaa and the predominantly Palestinian
town of Nusseibeh near Amman, the capital.
   Libya's official news agency JANA, monitored in Rome, reported a
march in Tripoli protesting military and economic measures aimed
against Iraq. But the dispatch did not say when the demonstration
took place, or how many people participated.
   In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinians demonstrating in
support of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein clashed with Israeli
troops, Arab reporters said. There were no reports of any injuries.
   More than 400 supporters of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's mainstream Fatah faction took part in a rally in
Nablus, the largest city in the occupied West Bank.
   Arab reports said demonstrators carried pictures of the Iraqi
president and chanted: ``Go on! Go on! We are with you, Saddam!''
They said Israeli troops fired tear gas to disperse the protesters
and stone-throwing clashes erupted.
   Other pro-Saddam rallies and marches were also held in the West
Bank town of Tulkarum and in Khan Yunis and Gaza City in the Gaza
Strip, the reports said.
   The army said its forces had dispersed two demonstrations in the
West Bank and that no one was injured.
   Some Palestinians have bitterly criticized the international
moves to punish Saddam for occupying Kuwait, complaining no similar
moves have been made to support their demand for a homeland in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   In the Yemeni capital, witnesses said the demonstrators chanted
slogans denouncing the buildup of Arab and Western forces in Saudi
Arabia.
   Thousands of protesters rallied in front of the American, Saudi
Arabian, Egyptian, British and French embassies, the witnesses
said. Official sources said the embassies were cordoned off to
protect them.
   Police dispersed the demonstrators by afternoon, the officials
said. Similar demonstrations were staged Thursday and Friday.

consultation, active consultation with other powers, who have naval
vessels there or under way, to be sure that no oil goes out. But we
aren't prepared to announce anything more than that. But I think in
terms of the world market and in terms of the effectiveness of the
sanctions, I can tell you that with the exception of one small
tanker, I believe it was, no vessels from Iraq or Kuwaiti ports are
trying to get out of there with cargo, with oil cargo.
   Q. Sir, if I may follow-up, have you made the decision in
principle, anyway, to impose this kind of _
   BUSH: I made the decision in principle, and I think most other
leaders have, that the sanctions will be fully enforced and that
exports from Iraq will not get into the _ get into the market.
   Q. Mr. President, could we ask at this point, with all of the
diplomatic efforts that you've constructed, what exactly is your
strategy now, if not simply just patience _ is that it?
   BUSH: No, my strategy _ well, the goal is to get Iraq out,
obviously, of Kuwait and have the legitimate rulers return. That is
the goal, and the strategy is to use economic sanctions, fully
effective, to see that that happens. And there's another part of
our strategy, and that is to show a willingness on the part of the
United States and other countries to tell Saddam Hussein that
aggression will not be successful, and that friends will be
protected.
   Q. (Inaudible) _ that with all of these sanctions in place and
with the effective encirclement that you have going, that there'll
be forces inside Iraq who will rise up against Hussein?
   BUSH: That sometimes happens when leaders get so out of touch
with reality that they commit their country to outrageous acts.
That does happen. And I know that some countries around the world
are hoping that that'll happen in this situation. But, we'll have
to wait and see.

   President Bush suggested Saturday
that Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein risks overthrow from within
unless he ``changes his spots.'' Pentagon sources said
sophisticated U.S. missiles capable of knocking out Iraqi tanks and
aircraft had been deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   The administration said the economic quarantine of Iraq was
biting hard, and expressed ``significant optimism'' now that Arab
troops were joining American forces in the armed defense of Saudi
Arabia.
   The administration said it was encouraged that 11 Americans,
including 10-year-old Penelope Nabokov, were allowed to leave Iraq
overnight. Yet, an estimated 3,800 Americans remain in Iraq and
Kuwait, prevented from leaving.
   ``We think it would be a mistake to characterize it as a hostage
situation and to use a word like that since we are in discussion
(with Iraq) with respect to the matter,'' Secretary of State James
A. Baker III said. He said there was no indication any Americans
have been mistreated.
   From his vacation home on the coast of Maine, Bush turned up the
heat on Saddam, a day after the Iraqi leader declared a ``holy
war'' against countries uniting against his invasion of Kuwait.
Bush consulted Arab leaders on the growing multinational military
buildup in the Saudi desert.
   Bush said the United States was not prepared to support Saddam's
ouster but said that ``some countries around the world are hoping
that that will happen.'' He said such an ouster ``sometimes happens
when leaders get so out of touch with reality that they commit
their country to outrageous acts.''
   The military buildup grew in the Persian Gulf and their were
fresh indications that a naval blockade was being readied against
Iraqi commerce.
   Up to 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to take up positions in
Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks, and Pentagon sources say
contingency plans call for as many as 250,000 to be sent if Iraq
makes a military move into Saudi Arabia.
   In Riyadh, diplomatic sources said Saudi Arabian anti-aircraft
batteries on Saturday fired at two Iraqi reconnaissance planes near
the border with Kuwait. They said the planes turned back without
crossing the border.
   Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Patriot ground-to-air missiles were earmarked for deployment in
Saudi Arabia, and that U.S. Stinger shoulder-fired guided missiles
already had arrived in the kingdom as the United States prepares
for a possible Iraqi invasion.
   Other anti-aircraft missiles to be deployed include the
Chaparral, a supersonic mobile heat-seeking missile that is capable
of knocking out aircraft and helicopters at low altitude, the
sources said.
   While praising the success of sanctions to enforce a United
Nations trade embargo against Iraq, the White House said that
``planning for a blockade is underway, should it be necessary.''
   Bush said, ``The good news is that no shipping from Iraq is
coming through the Straits of Hormuz,'' and added that the United
States was working with other naval forces in the region ``to be
sure that no oil goes out but we aren't prepared to announce
anything more than that.''
   Asked about a blockade, Bush said, ``I've made the decision in
principle and I think most other leaders have that the sanctions
will be fully enforced and that exports from Iraq will not get into
the market.''
   ``Right now the United Nations sanctions are being widely
implemented and there is no Iraqi oil leaving Turkey or Saudi
Arabia,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman.
Pipelines through Saudi Arabia and Turkey are the primary outlets
for carrying Iraq's oil.
   ``The embargo appears to be having considerable effect,''
Fitzwater added.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was ``in contact
almost hourly with Iraqi officials concerning the safety'' of the
3,800 Americans in Kuwait and Iraq.
   Bush met with Baker and other top advisers to review
developments. Later, in a news conference, Bush was asked whether
he would support the ouster of Saddam.
   ``We're not prepared to support the overthrow but I hope that
these actions that have been taken will result in an Iraq that is
prepared to live peacefully in a community of nations,'' Bush said.
``And if that means Saddam Hussein changes his spots, so be it. And
if he doesn't, I hope the Iraqi people do something about it so
that their leader will live by the norms of international behavior
that will be acceptable to other nations.''
   On the first full day of a 25-day vacation, Bush found time for
leisure time activity, too. Despite a driving rain, he went out
during the morning on his racing boat, Fidelity. He also played
golf in the rain.
   He was up early to press diplomatic efforts by phone. At 5:45
a.m., the president called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
congratulated him on the Arab summit meeting, which decided Friday
to send Arab troops to Saudi Arabia.
   Bush also called King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the emirs of
Bahrain and Qatar.
   ``I think things are moving in the right direction,'' Bush told
reporters. ``We're pleased so far with the solidarity,
cohesiveness, of the economic actions that have been taken.''
   Bush said Saddam was increasingly isolated, as demonstrated by
the Arab summit's commitment of troops to Saudi Arabia. Bush said
that was a promising development in view of Saddam's ``outrageous
rhetoric and outrageous military action against Kuwait.''
   Bush said he hoped that economic sanctions would deter Saddam.
   He said the United States and other nations must prove their
willingness ``to tell Saddam Hussein that aggression will not be
successful and that friends will be protected.''
   Asked if forces in Iraq might rise up against Saddam, Bush
replied,
   ``I know that some countries around the world hope that'll
happen in this situation, but we'll have to wait and see,'' Bush
said. ``My feeling is that whatever it takes to have our objectives
met is what should take place.''
   The president noted differences with Jordan's King Hussein, who
came to Saddam's defense after his forces invaded Kuwait.
   Bush said the Jordanian monarch ``has been a friend of the
United States for a long time and I'd like to see that friendship
be reinstated or be reinvigorated in the future.'' He said Hussein,
whose country borders Iraq, was ``in a difficult position.''
   On a related front, Bush said it appeared that oil prices were
moderating after sharp increased.
   ``We are using every diplomatic channel we can to be sure that
there are no shortages and there is no gouging and there isn't some
profit windfall made by _ out of these most unfortunate events.''

<HEAD>Catholics Rallying As Another Scandal Rocks Atlanta Archdiocese</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta had
just recovered from a pedophilia scandal when along came Vicki
Long, whose allegedly intimate ties with three clergyman plunged
the church into another swirl of gossip.
   Ms. Long's links with men of the cloth have set church
telephones jangling with queries from tabloids and TV talk show
hosts. The former lay minister is scheduled to appear in next
week's National Enquirer. MGM-United Artists is interested in a
movie-of-the-week.
   All the prurient interest in the affair hasn't made life easy on
local Roman Catholics. They are responding with compassion toward
the priests, anxiety for their church and irritation with the media.
   ``It's a very painful process for all of us,'' said the Rev.
Peter Dora, a spokesman for the archdiocese. ``But there is a very
significant level of support, mostly by mail.''
   ``They're making too much out of this,'' said 63-year-old Neil
Brogan when she heard that her priest, the Rev. Michael Woods,
resigned because of his ties to Ms. Long. ``They're human beings,
not gods.''
   Ms. Long's saga with the church began when she filed a paternity
suit against a Columbus priest, the Rev. Donal Keohane, claiming he
fathered her 4-year-old daughter, LaDonna Michelle. Keohane denied
the charge and blood tests proved he could not be the father, but
the church is paying child support.
   Church officials two weeks ago confirmed reports that Archbishop
Eugene Marino, who stepped down as the nation's highest-ranking
black Catholic in July, had resigned because of an ``intimate''
relationship with Ms. Long that involved paying her $1,500 monthly.
The archdiocese is conducting an audit to see whether church funds
were used.
   Two days later, Woods resigned because of his relationship with
Ms. Long.
   Dora said Friday that Marino was admitted to a psychiatric unit
at an undisclosed hospital late Thursday.
   Ms. Long, who was relieved of her lay minister duties at St.
John the Evangelist Church, has refused to comment. But her
attorney, Anthony Fontana, said she was victim of sexual abuse who
turned to Marino for help and then was manipulated by him.
   Ms. Long claims she and Marino were secretly married, but denies
having a sexual relationship with Woods, who is her daughter's
godfather.
   Ms. Long flew to Chicago Thursday to discuss possibly airing her
story with Oprah Winfrey, who hosts a syndicated TV talk show.
   ``We don't know what to believe anymore,'' said Mary Bishop, who
attends Ms. Long's Hapeville church. ``If she's right, what's that
say about the priests? But if she's wrong, she's dragged us all
into the mud for nothing.''
   The ever-changing allegations come just months after another
scandal rocked the Atlanta archdiocese, which covers 69 counties
and about 175,000 Catholics.
   The Rev. Anton Mowat, a visiting priest from Britain who spent
two years as associate pastor of a Stone Mountain church, was
accused of molesting four altar boys during a 12-month period
ending in October 1987. He disappeared before his arrest but was
found in England in January. Mowat was sentenced to six years in
prison in May, and the archdiocese settled a lawsuit by three of
the boys' parents by agreeing to pay $358,000.
   ``It's sad that this had to come just after the news about
(Mowat) finally died down,'' said Cynthia Kennedy of Atlanta,
interviewed as she left St. Anthony's Catholic Church. ``We thought
that was bad enough.''
   Many Catholics are rallying around the church. Bishop James P.
Lyke, the acting archdiocese administrator, said the scandal had
prompted an ``avalanche of people who care'' to call their churches.
   ``People's feelings about their ministers arise from their
personal relationships with them. You will find these in a great
degree very positive.'' Lyke said.
   One priest said members of his congregation were concerned about
the allegations.
   ``But so many feel that the situation has just grown too
bizarre, and they are deeply worried about whether Bishop Marino
and Father Woods will survive.''

   Two Dutch teenagers were arrested
Saturday as they tried to open a grave in the cemetery of a Roman
Catholic monastery. They said they were digging for human skulls,
Dutch television reported.
   The two suspects, aged 16 and 18, had already removed a
tombstone when they were surprised by the monastery's gardener, the
report said.
   The report quoted police as saying the two had removed at least
two skulls, one of which they sold to an unknown buyer for $56.

desecrated tombs.
   The teenagers were suspected of desecrating at least two other
graves at the monastery and two more at a public cemetery in this
southern Dutch city since mid-June, the television said.
   The suspects were not identified in line with Dutch police
practice.

<HEAD>Poll: Bush Approval Rating Jumps With Crisis Response</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's handling of the current Middle
East crisis boosted his approval rating among Americans to 75
percent, the second-highest total since he took office, a Newsweek
poll released Saturday shows.
   An overwhelming percentage of Americans _ 93 percent _ felt U.S.
oil companies were taking advantage of the Middle East uprising to
unfairly raise gasoline prices, the poll showed.
   It also showed 94 percent of Americans supported military
retaliation if Iraqi troops struck against U.S. troops; 79 percent
favored a U.S. strike if the Iraqis killed U.S. civilians in Kuwait
or Iraq; and 61 percent backed a strike if the Iraqis took American
hostages.
   Three out of four Americans believed it was at least somewhat
likely that the U.S. forces in the Middle East will engage in
combat with Iraqi troops, the poll said.
   The poll showed that 58 percent were opposed to a covert
assassination of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
   Bush's rating was his second-highest since Newsweek began
gauging his approval rate in May 1989. Last month, his approval
stood at 65 percent, with 26 percent disapproval; only 15 percent
disapproved now, the poll showed.
   The Gallup Organization conducted a telephone survey of 770
adults on Aug. 9-10. The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus
4 percentage point.

   BUSH: My _ my feeling is that whatever it takes to have our
objectives met is what should take place. Yeah, Ann.
   Q. Mr. President, who is in command of the multinational force
that's on the ground in Saudi Arabia now, and who will take the
lead _
   BUSH: Well, General Schwarzkopf is in command of the United
States forces, and then arrangements are being worked out as these
other countries send components to have a more detailed structure.
And clearly, the _ we're in Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the
King. They have forces _ the Saudis have forces on the ground. So,
we will be very sensitive to the requirements of the Saudi
government.
   Q. But will it be the Saudis who are actually in control of _
   BUSH: Well, as I say, the arrangements _ I don't believe _ I can
ask General Scowcroft _
   GEN. BRENT SCOWCROFT: Still working it out.
   BUSH: Still being worked out.
   Q. Yesterday you said that maybe, just maybe, somebody could
talk some sense into Saddam so he'll retreat and back off, but you
said you weren't optimistic. Following the events of the past 24
hours with the Arab League, are you any more optimistic _
   BUSH: Well, I _ I don't know about being optimistic or
pessimistic, but I must say that the forthright position taken by
the Arab summit is very, very positive, and it must make Saddam
Hussein realize how isolated he is in terms of world opinion. There
have been many manifestations of that before the Arab summit, but
now with the Arab countries weighing in in spite of his outrageous
_ Saddam's outrageous rhetoric and outrageous military action
against Kuwait, I'd say that's very promising.
   Q. Mr. President, you said a moment ago you supported doing
whatever it takes to meet your objectives. Does that include
overthrowing Saddam Hussein?
   BUSH: I'll just leave it sit out there and everybody can figure
it out. And they can see the mobilization of forces, and they can
see the determination on the part of the whole world to make these
economic sanctions be successful.
   Q. Mr. President, could you give us any optimistic report on
efforts to get out non-diplomatic American citizens who are caught
up there?

   Three teen-agers charged in the rape and beating
of the so-called Central Park jogger waited in court with their
parents as jurors worked through the weekend trying to reach a
verdict.
   Antron McCray, 16, Yusef Salaam, 16, and Raymond Santana, 15,
are charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, riot,
assault and robbery in separate attacks on the woman and two male
joggers during an April 19, 1989, gang rampage in the park.
   Jurors in their third day of deliberations viewed a videotaped
statement to police from Santana and asked Acting Supreme Court
Justice Thomas Galligan to explain a point of law dealing with a
robbery charge stemming from an attack on one of the male runners.
   According to prosecutors, the woman now known as the Central
Park jogger was jumped and dragged into the woods, where she was
gang-raped, bashed with a brick and a pipe and left to die.
   Her recovery after the savage attack captured the attention of
the city and the nation. The jogger is back at work as a vice
president at Salomon Brothers investment bankers.
   One defense attorney has suggested the jogger was never raped,
and the lawyers for the teen defendants have charged that
incriminating statements from their clients were coerced by police.

<HEAD>Verdict In Washington Mayor's Trial Prompts Extra Newspaper
Coverage</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Barry, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mistrial in Mayor Marion Barry's drug and
perjury case prompted the Washington Times on Saturday to publish
its first-ever weekend edition.
   It was the second-ever extra edition for the 8-year-old
newspaper that usually is published Monday through Friday. The more
widely distributed Washington Post is printed seven days a week.
   The first extra edition published by the Times came after
Barry's arrest Jan. 18.
   Barry was convicted Friday of a single misdemeanor cocaine
possession offense after a trial that featured a video tape showing
the mayor smoking crack cocaine during an FBI sting operation. The
U.S. District Court jury acquitted Barry on another misdemeanor
charge and deadlocked on a dozen other charges, including three
felony perjury counts. The judge declared a mistrial on those 12
counts.
   Linda Clark, spokeswoman for The Times, said Saturday's
newspaper was being sold in downtown Washington and in newsstands
and racks on the street. She said the paper also was being
distributed in some suburban areas.

<TEXT>
   BUSH: Well, I might ask Secretary Baker to comment on that. But
some Americans have come out today, but, Jim, do you want to _ can
you add anything to that.
   BAKER: Simply repeat what I said yesterday in Brussels, and that
is that we are still discussing this matter with representatives of
the government of Iraq. We are hopeful that we'll be able to
resolve the situation because it does, after all, run against all
international norms, the fact that American citizens and other
foreign nationals as well are not permitted to leave Iraq or to
leave Kuwait.
   Q. Why do you not believe this constitutes a hostage situation
since they are, in fact, detained?
   BAKER: Well, nothing has been demanded or asked in connection
with permitting them to leave the country, for one thing. And we
think it would be a mistake to characterize it as a hostage
situation and to use a word like that since we are in discussion
with respect to the matter. And as far as we know, no American
citizens have, as yet, been mistreated.
   Q. Will you keep the Kuwaiti Embassy open, Mr. Secretary, until
_ unless the Iraqis force it closed? Is that what it will take to
close the Iraqi Embassy in Kuwait City?
   BAKER: That's a matter that, frankly, we are discussing today.
And we will continue to discuss it. The European Community, the
ASEAN nations and others have all told Iraq that they are going to
maintain their embassies because they do not want to give credence
to the suggestion that Iraq has somehow annexed Kuwait. I think
it's important to remember that not only do we have these loyal
government officials there, but we have 3,800 American citizens in
Kuwait, as well.
   Q. Mr. President, there's now reports there may be as many as a
quarter-million American troops going to Saudi Arabia _
   BUSH: Again, I'm not prepared to comment on troop numbers. I've
tried to make that clear. I believe that (Secretary of Defense
Dick) Cheney and (Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin) Powell have
taken that same position, and as long as forces are moving, we're
just going to leave it there.
   Q. But, sir, is a quarter-million out of the realm of
possibility?
   BUSH: You must have misunderstood me. I said I'm
   not going to comment on that.
   Q. Mr. President, did you talk to King Hussein _
   BUSH: Yeah _ yeah _ just a sec.
   Q On the subject of _ why don't you go over there _
   BUSH: Okay. (Laughter) _ no, I did not talk to King Hussein. The
two other Arab leaders that I talked to today were the rulers of
Qatar and Bahrain.
   Q. There seems to be some concern that Jordan is something of a
back door for Iraq both in terms of being able to provide a supply
line and also perhaps further military exercises. What are you
saying or trying to do to convince Hussein that he should, perhaps,
go along with the rest of his Arab neighbors?
   BUSH: Well you know, it was interesting at the Arab summit that
Jordan did not vote against the resolution, and they _ I believe
they abstained, but in any event they were not against. We all
recognize the difficult position that King Hussein is in.
   There's no question to that, and in my view, he has been a
friend to the United States for a long time. And I'd like to see
that friendship be reinstated, or be reinvigorated in the future.
He's in a difficult position, and I was pleased that he did not
vote against that resolution yesterday.
   But let's face it, we have had some differences with Jordan over
what initially appeared to be a little bit of a strong backing for
Saddam Hussein. So we're _ we respect the territorial integrity of
Jordan. We respect its sovereignty, and I will not kind of go into
hypothetical situations as what might happen to Jordan. But it is a
relationship that presidents for years have valued, and it's one
that I hope we can restore through a lot of contact to its vitality
in the future.
   I think I spoke quite candidly the other day when I said there
was a certain disappointment factor there. But now, with what the
king was able to do yesterday, perhaps we can find ways to move
forward. I would like to do that when all of this comes down.
   Q. What's your next step, Mr. President, now?

<TEXT>
   BUSH: My next step is to stay in touch with the situation over
there and to implement the plan that is already in effect. And that
is to do what we can to guarantee the total effectiveness of the
Chapter VII sanctions, and then take further steps that I'm not
prepared to discuss in detail, that will guarantee the integrity of
Saudi Arabia, for openers, and by being there, offer some moral
support at least for countries in the area who could be threatened
in the future from this Saddam Hussein.
   Q. Mr. President, some said yesterday's Arab summit effectively
exhausted the diplomatic solution. Do you feel that as well? Is the
next step military?
   BUSH: No, I think we've still got plenty of diplomacy to _ ahead
of us with lots of countries and lots of _ and in lots of different
avenues. So, I wouldn't say that.
   Q. But how do you get to Saddam Hussein, who's not listening to
anybody?
   BUSH: Well, we have _ you know, these economic sanctions haven't
been in effect very long. Already, as I've indicated, there are
some signs that they are going to have an effect, and we'll just
have to wait and see. These kinds of actions cannot be judged 48
hours after they're put into place, or 72 or whatever. I think
we've just got to wait and see how all of this develops.
   But I think he does see today more clearly than he saw yesterday
at this time that the world is united against him. And by that I
mean the action of the Arab summit was very, very important in this
regard. So these things are happening as we go along now, different
countries taking strong positions. So I'd say there's still room
for more diplomacy, but we'll just have to wait and see whether
this _ whether it makes an impact on him.
   Yeah, Michael.
   Q. Mr. President, would you like to see a United Nations
military force? And can you tell us specifically what other
countries are you expecting to put troops on the ground in Saudi
Arabia?
   BUSH: No, I can't tell you what others, but I think you'll see
others, and _ I know you'll see others, and I cannot prematurely
say who they will be. And in terms of the United Nations, I think
that there could be a role in the naval side for some UN role. But
I don't think that our plans are contingent upon a UN flag flying
over the effort, as was the case in Korea, for example.

   An earthquake set off landslides that
blocked roads and buried homes in this Andean nation, killing at
least four people, officials said Saturday.
   The temblor at 10 p.m. Friday lasted about 25 seconds, said Hugo
Yepez, director of the Geodesic Institute.
   More than 40 aftershocks were recorded after the quake, which
registered 5.0 on the Richter scale.
   Four people died when a landslide crushed a house in Pomasqui,
12 miles north of Quito, the capital, said Emilio Suarez, the civil
defense director.
   Suarez said landslides buried part of the Pan American highway
and at least 10 adobe houses in the sparsely populated area north
of Quito. He said many other roads were also blocked.
   A one-mile stretch along one lane of the Pan American highway
remained obstructed Saturday, Suarez said. He did not known whether
any vehicles were buried by the landslide.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.

   President Hosni Mubarak said Saturday he
believes there is no hope for a peaceful solution to Iraq's
invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
   His comments came a day after the Arab League passed a
resolution calling for the dispatch of troops to Saudi Arabia and
supporting mandatory economic sanctions imposed by the United
Nations against Iraq.
   Egypt and Morocco immediately sent advance units to Saudi
Arabia. Diplomatic sources said the two Arab countries were each
expected to provide 5,000 troops.
   After the first Egyptian and Moroccan troops landed, Saudi
Arabian anti-aircraft guns fired about 10 rounds Saturday to deter
two Iraqi reconnaisance planes close to the border with Kuwait,
diplomatic sources said. The planes turned back without crossing
the border, the sources said, requesting anonymity.
   Iraq denied any of its planes crossed the border but did not say
whether any of its aircraft came under fire.
   When asked by reporters if he believed there was any chance of a
peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis, Mubarak said:
   ``I want to tell you honestly _ and note that I am always
optimistic _ there is no hope for that.''
   It is unclear if the Arab troops will join with the thousands of
American soldiers deployed in the desert kingdom.
   Arab states have repeatedly called for Arab troops to protect
Saudi Arabia from Iraqi troops massing on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border.
   ``The solution for the Gulf crisis should be purely Arab,'' said
Sudanese leader Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir.
   The independent Tunisian daily As-Sabah wrote: ``An Arab
solution, bad as it may be, is a thousand times better than what an
American intervention could bring about. The United States has only
caused misfortune to Arabs.''
   Twelve of the 21 Arab League members supported the measure,
while nine either voted against it, abstained or expressed
reservations.
   There have been demonstrations in Jordan, Yemen, Libya and
Mauritania to protest against the massive American buildup in Saudi
Arabia.
   Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed al-Ghazali said Saturday, ``We
had rejected all intervention, direct or indirect, by foreigners in
considering solutions.''
   In his Saturday interview with reporters, Mubarak repeatedly
blasted Arab delegates for their ineffective and disruptive
behavior at Friday's emergency session of the Arab League.
   ``What a racket. It was noisy, with everyone wanting to speak. I
like organization, so imagine two or three talking together at the
same time,'' Mubarak said. His comments were carried by the Middle
East News Agency.
   He said at one point Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat asked to address the summit ``and he started talking
about the mediation between Afghanistan and Kashmir.''
   ``I explained to him that we were here to solve the problem of
Kuwait and asked if they had any solutions,'' the Egyptian
president added.
   ``I called for a summit hoping we would find a way out but they
sat and exchanged accusations,'' Mubarak said. ``(A) few talked
well, but no one came up with a realistic and practical solution.''
   He also explained why a proposal to send an Arab League
delegation to Iraq failed.
   ``I refuse to go to Baghdad because I know the result in
advance. I asked the people on the list if they wanted to go to
Baghdad as a mediation committee but none of them responded and no
one volunteered to go,'' he said.
   The early Sunday editions of the state-owned Cairo newspapers
al-Ahram and al-Akhbar accused Arafat of supporting Saddam and
deliberately trying to stop the summit from reaching any
resolutions.
   ``The most important landmark of this summit was the crazy
attempts by the Iraqi and Palestinian delegations to sabotage the
summit,'' al-Akhbar's editor Galal Dewidar wrote.
   He said that Kuwait's deposed emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, wore a bullet-proof vest to the summit after learning
that Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraq's deputy premier, was carrying his
personal handgun.

   The plucky spirit of 10-year-old Penelope
Nabokov surprised even her father, he said Saturday after a desert
caravan brought the girl to the safety of Jordan after nine days in
occupied Kuwait.
   ``The spirit that sometimes keeps her mother and I trembling was
still there,'' Peter Nabokov said. ``She's obviously being treated
well. I had the sense that she was moving through and (was)
protected by a field of very well-meaning people.''
   Penelope reached freedom in Jordan on Saturday after a 72-hour,
660-mile journey with 10 other Americans in several cars. She had
been trapped in Kuwait when Iraqi forces invaded Aug. 2.
   ``I asked her if she was OK, and she said, `Well, Dad, how would
you feel if you had been driving across the desert for 72 hours?'''
Nabokov told reporters outside City Hall in the family's hometown
of Albany, a suburb of Oakland.
   ``The border crossing was a bit dicey, I gather,'' he said. The
Americans twice ran into difficulty because they lacked proper
permits and had to call on diplomats to negotiate passage, he said.
   ``She didn't tell me about the food. She didn't tell me about
where she was sleeping,'' he said. ``Details didn't stick in my
mind as much as the cool, deliberative way in which she described
her movements. She was reporting to Dad.''
   Nabokov said Penelope told him she wanted to come home and see
her friends, who have been closely following her plight. But
instead, Nabokov said, he planned to fly to France on Sunday to
meet with his daughter and his wife, Isabelle.
   He did not elaborate on the family's plans to return to the
United States.
   Penelope was on her way to join Isabelle Nabokov in India when
the episode began with the girl's British Airways flight making an
unfortunately timed stopover in Kuwait.
   Despite the ordeal, ``she was in phenomenally good spirits, well
spoken, describing everything with a reporter's memory,'' Nabokov
said.
   The experience hasn't soured her on travel, her father said.
She's made frequent trips abroad with her parents, both
anthropologists, and has been traveling alone since age 6. Nabokov
also speculated that her status as a solo traveler probably helped
her get released more quickly.
   Penelope's spirits remained strong during most of her ordeal,
although her father said she broke into tears while speaking to her
mother after the girl was released to the American Embassy in
Kuwait a few days ago.
   ``I got the impression it wasn't so much out of fear as (it was)
out of anger,'' Peter Nabokov said, adding that she was worried
about three other children still stranded at a Kuwait hotel where
she had stayed with other passengers stranded because of the
stopover.
   He identified them as 14-year-old Vinil Polam, an Indian girl
traveling alone; and the Bazners, 6-year-old Elizabeth, and her
infant brother, Kevin, who are traveling with their parents, Dawn
and David.
   At the time of the invasion, Penelope was flying unaccompanied
from France to India, where she was to have joined her mother. In
Kuwait, she was taken into custody by Iraqi soldiers, and later
brought to Baghdad with some of the passengers from the plane.
   The 11 Americans, who included some personnel from the U.S.
Embassy in Baghdad and their dependents, drove in several cars from
the Iraqi capital to the Jordanian border outpost of Ruweishid on
Saturday.
   There, they were met by U.S. officials. Penelope was allowed to
pass the Jordanian border post without any formalities, according
to an AP photographer at the scene, and she left for Amman by car
with a U.S. Embassy staff member.
   The rest of the group made the five-hour, 210-mile trip by
embassy bus.

   Q. How critical is it that there be other troops besides
   Americans _
   BUSH: Well, they are there, and that's very important.
   Q. Mr. President, is the United States prepared in any way to
support the overthrow of Saddam?
   BUSH: No, we're not prepared to support the overthrow, but I
hope that these actions that have been taken will result in an Iraq
that is prepared to live peacefully in the community of nations.
And if that means Saddam Hussein
   changes his spots, so be it. And if he doesn't, I hope the Iraqi
people will do something about it, so that their leader will live
by the norms of international behavior that will be acceptable to
other nations.
   This is the last one _ yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, we all noticed yesterday that you didn't want
to use the word ``blockade.'' Is that because in your own mind
right now you consider that the Chapter VII sanctions enable you
legally to stop an Iraqi ship or two?
   BUSH: I think we have the authority to stop a ship at sea under
Chapter VII. There may be some difference of opinion on that. But
there's no use using _ using words that may have _ may have
different connotations in different countries and this one does in
terms of legality. And so, why do that? What we want to do is see
that no oil comes out through the Straits of Hormuz and if it
requires naval vessels to see that that _ that happens, fine. But I
just am not one who _ who flamboyantly believes in throwing a lot
   of words around. I'm more interested in action. And so, I've
been very pleased that the Iraqis are _ recognize that the export
of oil is almost an impossibility now. But we've got _ we've got
some more diplomacy to make sure that it is a total impossibility.
   Thank you all very much. Glad it's cleared up.
   Q. Can the oil companies _
   BUSH: Well, I think there's been a lightening up of _ on the
pricing and we're _ there's a lot of efforts under way to see that
there's plenty of supply in the international market. And if
anybody's familiar _ those _ for those who are familiar with the
availability of production that isn't on the market, one would
conclude that other countries can be helpful in making up the loss
from Kuwait and loss from Iraq. So, to the American people, I would
say we are using every diplomatic channel we can to be sure that
there are no shortages and there is no gouging and that there isn't
some profit windfall made by _ out of these most unfortunate events.
   But I'm confident that there can be stability in the
international oil market because there is excess capacity around
the world and some countries have stepped up and said they want to
help and we salute them for that. And so I'm _ and I'm encouraged
and _ by how the diplomacy is working there and yet we still have
more to do to guarantee that there not be a lot of hardship for
countries around the world.
   Thank you all very, very much. Thank you.

   Three members of a New York rock 'n' roll
band and a nightclub owner were arrested Saturday after the group
played songs from 2 Live Crew's album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be''
to protest censorship.
   Too Much Joy played to a crowd of about 350 people at Club
Futura early Saturday to protest the arrests of the controversial
rap group's band members two months ago in Broward County and to
raise money for their legal defense.
   ``We played a game of constitutional chicken, and the group Too
Much Joy lost,'' said Robin Blumner, executive director for the
American Civil Liberties Union in Florida.
   Arrested for investigation of performing a lewd show were band
members Jay Blumenfield, 24; Alexander Smallens, 24; and Timothy
Quirk, 25, all from affluent Scarsdale, N.Y. They were released on
$100 bond.
   If convicted, each man faces up to one year in prison and a fine
of $1,000.
   Four undercover sheriff's officers watched the group's
performance before deciding to make the arrests, said sheriff's
spokesman Jim Leljedal.
   ``Band members had stated publicly that they intended to perform
obscene material and they expected to be arrested,'' Leljedal said
in a statement.
   Club owner Kenneth Geringer, 34, was arrested on charges of
promoting an obscene performance, officials said. He was released
on his own recognizance.
   The group's drummer, Tom Vinton, 24, was not arrested because he
was not singing, authorities said.
   ``The arrests effectively terrorize other singing groups to
conform to certain standards of performances,'' Blumner said. ``It
says `You must toe the line, be pedestrian and don't rock the
boat.'''
   Too Much Joy released the album ``Son of Sam I Am'' two years
ago.
   2 Live Crew leader Luther ``Luke Skyywalker'' Campbell and other
band members were arrested June 10 at the nightclub for performing
songs from their album. The album has been ruled obscene by a
federal judge under the state's obscenity law.

   The Americans in Kuwait are mostly oil
workers or diplomats, but there are also U.S. lawyers, physicians,
engineers and bankers in the country.
   In addition, there are school teachers and university
professors, and about 200 Kuwaitis married to Americans. The oil
workers are consultants, engineers and blue-collar workers.
   The State Department said there were about 3,800 Americans
registered with the U.S. Embassy at the time of the invasion, but
it is believed many of them were outside the country, on summer
vacation.
   There are an estimated 150 embassy staff and dependents
according to Kuwaitis who knew the embassy. Some estimates run as
high as 250.
   They were living in a compound attached to the embassy, but
travelers reaching Bahrain think the U.S. diplomats have all moved
into the embassy proper, which is more fortified.
   Most of them are believed to have been in the country at the
time of the invasion and apparently were still there a week later,
including Ambassador Wilson Nathaniel Howell.
   Getty Oil Co., which was operating on the Kuwaiti side of the
Divided Zone along the borders with Saudi Arabia, was able to
evacuate 100 American families to the neighboring kingdom as the
first waves of Iraqi troops rumbled across the borders.

   Saudi Arabian anti-aircraft
batteries on Saturday fired at two Iraqi reconnaissance planes near
the Kuwaiti border with the kingdom, diplomatic sources said.
   A Saudi Arabian official denied the incident took place. Iraq
denied any of its planes crossed the border but did not say
anything about whether any of its aircraft came under fire. U.S.
sources could not immediately confirm the report.
   The diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the Saudis fired about 10 rounds at the planes
in the Khafji region close to the border to deter them.
   They said the planes turned back without actually crossing the
border.
   A Saudi official denied there had been any firing at Iraqi
planes.
   ``It is not true at all ... the first bullet will not be from
Saudi Arabia,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Iraq's official Baghdad radio, quoting a spokesman, said: ``None
of our aircraft conducted any sortie over Saudi territory.''
   The spokesman said the reports were ``some sort of prattle and
buffoonery propagated by the suspect quarters that are seeking to
undermine great Iraq or to attack it.''
   In Washingon, Col. Miguel Monteverde, a Pentagon spokesman, said
he was aware of the report but that ``It's unconfirmed by American
sources.'' The State Department's Kuwait desk said it also was
unable to confirm the report.
   Contingents of Egyptian and Moroccan troops landed in the
kingdom early Saturday in line with an Arab summit decision,
diplomatic sources said. They said the Egyptian force was highly
trained in chemical warfare.
   The Arab troops began taking positions side by side with the
American contingents that preceded them as tension mounted in the
region with the first Saudi firing in the Khafji border region with
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   It was unclear how the Egyptian and Morrocan troops would be
deployed with American soldiers in Saudi Arabia, but all the forces
were landing at the same northeastern Saudi base.
   The Pentagon has committed 50,000 ground troops but the number
could skyrocket if Iraq invades with forces massed on the
Kuwait-Saudi border.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and took over the emirate within
hours.

<TEXT>
   The crisis touched off by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait is shattering old alliances in the Middle East, creating
surprising new lineups and possibly opening opportunities for the
United States to rebuild its once-fast friendship with Iran.
   That, in turn, could lead to fresh opportunities to try to win
freedom for six Americans long held hostage by pro-Iranian factions
in Lebanon.
   Alliances shift constantly in the Middle East, and the latest
round of change, flowing directly from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
and threat to Saudi Arabia, already has produced unexpected results.
   For their own reasons, Israel, Syria and Iran are lined up with
the United States _ and in effect with each other _ in a unlikely
coalition against Iraq.
   At the same time, Jordan is risking its reputation for
moderation by tilting toward Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. And
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is winning admiration in
Washington for his efforts to rally Arabs against Iraq.
   Perhaps the most startling development involves the United
States and Iran, which held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days in
1979-81 and regularly denounced America as ``the Great Satan.'' .
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has authorized indirect
talks with Tehran, creating a semblance of normal contacts that
hasn't existed since relations were broken after the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran was seized in 1979.
   From the Iranian point of view, nothing is more appealing than
having the United States ready to cross swords with Saddam. For
eight years, Iran waged relentless war against Baghdad hoping to
overthrow Saddam after Iraq invaded Iran in 1980.
   The effect on the fate of the hostages now in Lebanon _
including Terry Anderson, Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press _ is unknown. But President Bush has made it clear
since the day he took office that he would like to improve
relations with the fundamentalist leaders in Iran who are believed
to hold sway over those holding the hostages.
   Baker also has sent John H. Kelly, the assistant secretary of
state for the Near East, to Damascus to engage the Syrians.
   Officially, the State Department still brands Syria as a
supporter of terrorism, a notoriety lifted from Iraq in 1983.
   But President Hafez Assad's hatred of Saddam could be critical
in the U.S.-engineered drive against Iraq. Assad could divert
Iraq's military by sending troops to the common border or backing
covert activities in Iraq.
   The threat to Israel from Iraq is obvious, resulting from
Saddam's threat to rain deadly chemical warheads on the Jewish
state. But it took the Iraqi seizure of Kuwait to persuade the Bush
administration that Saddam must be confronted.
   Iraq's ballistic missiles may not be capable of spanning the 500
miles to Israel, but if Iraqi troops moved into Jordan either at
the invitation of King Hussein or against his will, Israel would be
at greater risk.
   King Hussein announced Wednesday that he would not let foreign
forces use Jordanian soil. And a senior U.S. official said Friday
there was no evidence he had.
   The Jordanian ruler's tilt toward Saddam seems odd considering
the weapons and aid lavished on him over the years by the United
States.
   In an interview taped in Jordan and broadcast Saturday on the
CNN ``Evans and Novak'' show, Hussein said the latest crisis occurs
``in this new world in which we live now _ no more a communist
threat _ and therefore there is an industrial future for this world
that depends on energy and I believe there is a struggle to try to
control the sources of energy in this area.''
   ``We want to world to enjoy these sources of energy,'' he said,
``but we want also to be recognized as the people on whose land
this very important commodity exists.''
   The king is a logical middleman should negotiations seem
possible with Saddam. But the Jordanian leader is fast losing his
credit in Washington.
   ``Obviously, he has put himself in a position now that is
difficult for him,'' said a senior American official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``I think he hoped he can be a mediator.
But there doesn't look to be much of a basis for mediation. And I
don't know how it enhances his credibility in the Arab world or the
outside to associate himself with Saddam Hussein.''
   Egyptian President Mubarak, on the other hand, is actively
trying to heal the rift between Iraq and the conservative Saudi
monarchy.
   The Arab summit meeting he hosted in Cairo voted Friday to send
Arab troops to Saudi Arabia to confront the Iraqis.
   It was a watershed event.
   But Mubarak's success in giving what U.S. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney calls an ``Arab face'' to the American military deployment
in Saudi Arabia also shattered Arab brotherhood.
   Only 12 of the 21 members of the Arab League voted to send
troops to protect Saudi Arabia and other gulf states from Iraq and
to impose economic sanctions to punish the Baghdad government.
Opposing the move were Iraq, the Palestine Liberation Organization
and Libya, and expressing reservations were Jordan, Sudan and
Mauritania. Others abstained.
   These divisions may deepen and turn more bitter when the Arab
League tries to enforce its decision.
   Still, Mubarak's diplomatic success enhances the admiration the
Bush administration holds for the Egyptian president.
   The Saudis, meanwhile, are generating sympathy that could have a
concrete payoff. Already, Baker and Cheney are promoting the idea
of selling the Saudis at least a dozen F-15 jet fighters.
   They hope Iraq's takeover of Kuwait's oil fields and the threat
to the rich Saudi fields will force Israel's supporters in Congress
to drop their opposition to the deal.
   Meanwhile, Jordan is not alone in risking its reputation for
moderation.
   Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, which has
been gaining ground in its campaign against Israel by lowering its
rhetoric, is in Saddam Hussein's corner. So is Libya, whose leader,
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, has been seen consistently as an extremist.

   An explosion and fire Saturday at an oil refinery
in a city north of Moscow killed three people and injured ten, the
official news agency Tass reported.
   A compressor station blew up and started a fire, the news agency
said. The blaze was extinguished within three hours.
   It sent a thick cloud of smoke over Yaroslavl, a city 250 miles
north of Moscow.

<HEAD>Palestinians March In Support Of Saddam Hussein</HEAD>

   Palestinians in the occupied territories
marched Saturday with Iraqi flags and posters of Saddam Hussein in
support of his invasion of Kuwait, Arab reporters said.
   More than 400 supporters of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's mainstream Fatah faction took part in the biggest
rally in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city and a hotbed of
violence.
   Arab reporters said the marchers carried banners and waved the
Iraqi and the outlawed Palestinian flags.
   Some Palestinians hail Saddam as a hero for standing up to the
superpowers while the Palestinians fight a seemingly hopeless
battle against Israeli rule.
   The demonstrators carried pictures of the Iraqi president and
chanted slogans like: ``Go on. Go on. We are with you Saddam,'' and
``Saddam Saddam, Attack Attack, Saddam,'' the reporters said.
   Israeli troops charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to
disperse them, the reports said. Stone-throwing clashes erupted,
but there were no reports of any injuries, they said.
   Other pro-Iraq rallies and marches were held in the West Bank
town of Tulkarem and in Khan Yunis and Gaza City in the Gaza Strip,
Arab reports said.
   The army said its forces had dispersed two demonstrations in the
West Bank and that no one was injured.
   During the 32-month uprising, 728 Palestinians have been killed
by Israeli soldiers and civilians, and another 247 slain as
suspected collaborators by fellow Arabs. Forty-seven Israelis have
been killed.
   Faisal Husseini, the leading pro-PLO activist in the occupied
lands, said the Palestinian support for Iraq was largely a sign of
frustration over the U.S. failure to force Israel to withdraw from
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``It is not that the Palestinians support the regime in Iraq or
believe in Saddam Husein's ideology, but because they believe there
is a double standard in the area,'' he said in a recent interview
with The Associated Press.
   Also Saturday, Deputy Foreign Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said
the United States so far has not asked Israel to take military
action in the Persian Gulf crisis.

   Families of the doctors and nurses aboard
a hospital ship bound for the Mideast bid stoic but troubled
farewells Saturday to loved ones who will care for the injured
should fighting erupt.
   ``He joined the Navy and I guess that's just part of the Navy's
way of life,'' said Lisa Abbott, who watched with her 2-year-old
daughter, Katie, as her husband, medic Don Abbott, boarded the USNS
Comfort.
   ``He is too much of an optimist to be worried,'' Mrs. Abbott
said, adding she wept hard before saying goodbye.
   The Comfort is one of two floating trauma centers designed for
emergency care of American troops. The Comfort and the Mercy, based
in Oakland, Calif., each have a 70-man crew and 1,200 medical
personnel.
   The Mercy also was being readied for deployment to the Mideast,
naval spokesman Bob Bordon said. He would not disclose when the
ship would leave.
   The Comfort has treatment areas for patients exposed to chemical
and biological weapons, such as those Iraq has threatened to use.
   Marie Barber, 35, of Bethesda, Md., brought her three children
to see the ship on which their father, Byron Barber, would work as
a plastic surgeon.
   ``It's not quite pleasant,'' Mrs. Barber said.
   Mary Vincent, 38, of Potomac, Md., was with her four children,
ages 11, 9, 4, and 16 months. Her husband, Michael Vincent, 40,
also is a plastic surgeon assigned to the ship.
   ``Obviously, you worry about their safety,'' she said. ``But we
feel it's very important that he goes.''
   The converted oil tanker departed at about 6:30 p.m. for a
12-hour trip to Norfolk, Va., where it will pick up more medical
personnel and supplies.
   The ship was loaded in Baltimore with fresh food, including 32
tons of melons, 15,000 pounds of potatoes, 10,000 pounds of
tomatoes, and 11,400 pounds of bananas, said ship spokeswoman Terri
Kaish.
   The ship will take 21 days to reach the Middle East via the Suez
Canal, said Marge Holtz, a spokeswoman for the Military Sealift
Command, which controls the ship in domestic ports. Medical
personnel will train during the voyage and have an ample supply of
magazines, books and video games for their spare time, she said.
   The ship is part of ``Operation Desert Shield,'' the military's
name for the deployment of U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia from
attack by Iraq.

   Here, at a glance, are the major developments Saturday in the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait:
   
   IRAQ-SAUDI: Saudi Arabian anti-aircraft batteries fired at two
Iraqi reconnaissance planes near the Kuwaiti border with the
kingdom, diplomatic sources said. Iraq downplayed the report and
denied any of its planes had crossed the border.
   The planes turned back without actually crossing the border,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A Saudi official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
denied the incident took place. In Washingon, Col. Miguel
Monteverde, a Pentagon spokesman, said he was aware of the report
but, ``It's unconfirmed by American sources.''
</TEXT>

   IRAQ: Iraq warned its people that anyone caught buying or
selling food on the black market will be executed, indicating it is
preparing for the economic sanctions imposed after the invasion of
Kuwait.
   President Saddam Hussein and his ruling Revolution Command
Council, according to Baghdad, met and said that ``any manipulation
of food supplies for trading purposes will be considered a crime
and a sabotage act infringing national security.''

   ANTI-U.S. DEMONSTRATIONS: Thousands of Yemeni demonstrators on
Saturday staged pro-Iraqi protests in front of several embassies in
the capital of S`Ana and smashed the windows of the U.S. mission,
witnesses said.
   In several Jordanian towns and cities, protesters denounced the
United States and hailed the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait. In Irbid,
50 miles north of Amman, a crowd of about 3,000 people chanted
pro-Iraqi slogans and speakers denounced Arab leaders who agreed to
send troops to Saudi Arabia as traitors.

   ARAB REACTION: Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he believes
there is no hope for a peaceful solution to Iraq's invasion and
occupation of Kuwait.
   Mubarak commented after the Arab League passed a resolution that
called for the dispatch of troops to Saudi Arabia and supported
mandatory economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations against
Iraq for invading and annexing Kuwait. Egypt immediately sent 5,000
troops and Morocco said it will deploy the same number.

   MULTINATIONAL FORCE: British fighter jets and Egyptian and

   AMERICANS RELEASED: Penelope Nabokov, a 10-year-old California
girl stranded in Kuwait when Iraq invaded, reached freedom in
Jordan after a grueling 72-hour, 660-mile desert journey with 10
other Americans. Her father described her as ``in phenomenally good
spirits.''
   Thousands of Americans were trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the
Aug. 2 invasion, but the plight of Penelope, who was traveling
alone when she was detained, has captured the most public attention.

<TEXT>
   Members of a Christian group carrying a
10-foot wooden cross and religious pamphlets railed at rock fans
outside a heavy metal concert Saturday, charging that the music
promotes devil worship.
   A group of about 125 people taking part in a ``Jackson for
Jesus'' weekend preached and sang through a microphone aimed at
youths waiting in line for ``Michigan Death Fest I,'' an 8-hour
concert featuring groups like Sacrifice, Lucifer's Hammer and
Nuclear Death.
   ``I want to let them know somebody loves them and cares about
them,'' said Stan Williams of Flint, one of the demonstrators.
   The concert-goers outside the Jackson Optimist Sports Arena
occasionally hooted and made obscene gestures.
   ``I'm a born-again Christian and I go to church. I don't see
what the big fuss is,'' said Brian Hadley, 20, one of the fans.
``They say we're worshiping Satan and we're not. It's just the kind
of music. It's just kind of loud and fast.''
   The Rev. Jerry Davis of Houston, Texas, said he talked to some
band members who told him their songs included ``Worship the
Coffin.''
   ``We're not talking about pop music that makes you feel good and
want to dance,'' said Davis, one of the rally organizers.
   Heavy metal music can encourage young people to commit suicide,
he said. ``It's the promotion of death,'' he said.
   Members of the British rock group Judas Priest are on trial in
Reno, Nev., charged with inserting subliminal messages into their
songs that led two youths to attempt suicide.
   Sandi Newton, owner of Double M Productions and the event's
promoter, said her son sings in the band Lucifer's Hammer. It has
nothing to do with Satan, but is a name taken from of a fictional
comet headed toward earth in a popular novel, she said.
   ``There's nothing in their lyrics about Satan. They have got one
song that talks about God called Gothic Cathedral. These people
don't know what they're talking about,'' she said. ``We don't push
our music on them. What gives them the right to push their religion
on us?''
   Newton, who said her father-in-law is a minister, said she sold
about 1,500 tickets for the eight-hour event. Tickets sold for $15
in advance and $17 at the door.

   Iran indicated Saturday it is willing to
cooperate with other Persian Gulf states to put pressure on Iraq,
but did not say whether Iranian troops would be sent to the region.
   ``Iran is prepared for any kind of cooperation with the
countries of the region which may restore peace and tranquility and
prevent the presence and influence of the superpowers in the
Persian Gulf,'' Tehran radio said.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, added: ``Serious pressure
must be brought to bear on Iraq, and Iran is ready to cooperate
with countries in the region to achieve peace and prevent a
superpower presence.''
   A U.S.-led multinational force has been deployed in Saudi Arabia
to block any Iraqi invasion. Egyptian and Moroccan troops arrived
in the desert kingdom Saturday as the advance guard of a force that
12 Arab League countries agreed to send at their summit in Cairo.
   Iran, whose forces are battle-hardened after fighting an
eight-year war with Iraq, has not indicated whether it is prepared
to send troops to support the multinational forces.
   But Tehran Television, also monitored in Nicosia, said that the
Supreme Security Council warned Saturday that ``Iran is prepared to
protect its interests under all conditions.''
   The council, headed by President Hashemi Rafsanjani, added that
``the buildup of foreign forces in the region, and in the Persian
Gulf waters, has heightened the crisis.
   ``Iran is concerned about the situation in the region,'' it
added.
   Iran, which considers itself the most powerful regional state,
would like to be seen as the policeman of the Gulf, and is
suspicious of any U.S. attempt to take on such a role following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iran is unlikely to send troops to protect Saudi Arabia from an
Iraqi attack given its anti-American stance and hatred of the Saudi
ruling family. Tehran's Shiite Moslem leaders have repeatedly
called for the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy, members of the
dominant Sunni Moslem sect.
   Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were among Iraq's staunchest Arab allies
in the 1980-88 Gulf war against Persian Iran.
   That war, which halted with a United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire in August 1988, was never formally ended with a peace
treaty.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must keep a wary eye on Iran, and
keep part of his 1-million-strong army stationed on his country's
eastern front.
   If Iraqi troops engage the multinational forces in Saudi Arabia,
Iran could try to take advantage of Iraq's international isolation
to reclaim hundreds of square miles of territory lost in the
closing weeks of the Persian Gulf war.
   Since the cease-fire, the Iranians have been calling in vain on
the United Nations to force Saddam to withdraw Iraqi troops from
Iranian territory.

<HEAD>Houston Ship Channel Open; Cleanup Equipment Moved Out of Bay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large ships were allowed to transit the
Houston Ship Channel from both directions simultaneously Saturday
for the first full day since a tanker collided with two barges,
spilling 700,000 gallons of oil.
   Meanwhile, salvage crews removed cleanup equipment from the bay,
which has been cluttered with skimmers, vacuum trucks and booms
since the July 28 accident. The cleanup ended Friday.
   ``We're trying to collect all the equipment for all of the
contractors today,'' Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Mike Shoul
said. ``Our overflight this morning failed to find any sign of the
oil. We'll do a final assessment on Monday.''
   A ban on shrimping in Trinity and Galbeston bays was lifted
Friday, but orders against taking crabs and oysters remained in
effect until laboratory tests for contamination of those species
are completed this week.
   The spill occurred when the Greek tanker Shinoussa collided with
two barges under tow. One barge sank and the other ruptured,
spilling heavy oil that threatened sensitive marshes, birds and
other wildlife.
   The sunken barge that had hampered traffic was freed of its
cargo, refloated, and cut into scrap metal. It was removed from the
shallow waters near the channel Friday afternoon.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Robert Douville and National
Transportation Safety Board investigator Allan Dreibelbis on Friday
reconvened a federal probe so they could watch a home video made by
a Georgia man who witnessed the accident.
   ``We hope it's going to help determine the relative positions of
the vessels,'' Douville, an investigator with the Coast Guard's
Marine Safety Office in New Orleans, said of the videotape.
   Coast Guard officials said Saturday they did not expect to take
further testimony.
   Douville said the findings will be forwarded to the admiral of
the Coast Guard's 8th District in about a month. Dreibelbis said
his agency expected to take about six months to review the accident.
   The Coast Guard estimated about 200,000 gallons of the oil was
collected by skimmers and shoreline cleanup crews. The whereabout
on the rest of the oil is unkown, officials said, though some
evaporated.

<TEXT>
   Crime may not pay but being a good samaritian
has its risks, too. A store owner found that out when he was
sprayed with red dye while trying to return bundles of money left
behind by a bank robber.
   It started when a man walked into the Banco De Ponce in Harlem
on Saturday morning and demanded money from a teller, said police
spokesman Sgt. Norris Hollomon.
   The teller gave the man two money packets rigged with timed
devices set to explode a few moments later and spray the robbers
with telltale red dye.
   But after the robber walked out of the bank, he inexplicably
tossed the money in front of the building.
   Eli Hacyem, who owns a store next to the bank, saw the money and
carried it back into the bank. The parcel exploded and sprayed him
and 10 bank customers with dye.
   Two people were treated for minor injuries they suffered when
the money exploded; one woman suffered eye irritation and one man
was treated for blood pressure problems, Hollomon said.
   The bank robber escaped, officials said.

<HEAD>Two Protesters Charge They Were Run Down by Navy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two dolphin activists charge they were run
over by Navy boats while trying to halt the testing of 1,200-pound
explosives near the Dry Tortugas, and the Navy concedes the men
could have been hit.
   ``They used boats as weapons,'' said Russ Rector was injured in
Friday's protest along with Richard O'Barry, the dolphin trainer
for the ``Flipper'' TV series of the 1960s.
   ``They ran right over me,'' Rector said. ``I dove down and, by
the grace of God, I'm not chewed up by propellers.''
   O'Barry suffered a concussion and bruises, according to a
medical report from Florida Keys Memorial Hospital. Rector suffered
a back injury and bruises and left the hospital with his right arm
in a sling.
   O'Barry, 50, and Rector, 42, were dropped from a sea plane into
the test zone in the Gulf of Mexico. They were swimming with the
aid of propeller-driven Aqua Scooters when they saw boats approach,
said Lincoln O'Barry, Richard's son and vice president of an
activist group called the Dolphin Project.
   The two were run over by a boat about 60 feet long and then
repeatedly hit by other smaller boats, Rector said. O'Barry said he
was hit in the head and jabbed in the face with an aluminum pole.
   ``It's very bizarre, very bizarre,'' Lincoln O'Barry said
Saturday. ``It's something I just couldn't believe would happen.''
   Dolphin activists have demanded cancellation of the Navy tests
because of area dolphin sightings. Fishermen want the tests
suspended because the region is home to several seafood varieties,
and environmentalists are concerned about possible damage to nearby
coral reefs.
   When asked for comment on the report, Ensign Robin Perkins at
Key West Naval Station said, ``They in fact were trying to get in
the way of the boats.''
   ``Apparently they were pursued, and one of the boats could have
hit them,'' said Dan Probert, who is overseeing the Navy trials.
   The Coast Guard pulled the men from the water about 85 miles
northwest of Key West and delivered them to the hospital on
stretchers.
   ``We were told (by the Navy) we had two injured people in the
water,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Karonis. ``Our only
involvement was to help get the two injured people out of the water
and bring them back to Key West.''
   O'Barry, who has previously taken part in ``guerrilla''
activities like cutting open dolphin cages under water, began his
latest campaign Thursday. He grabbed a plastic orange buoy floating
over a Navy bomb and held on for nine hours until he was returned
to Key West by the Coast Guard.
   O'Barry and Rector headed back to the test site Friday but
arrived about an hour after an explosive had been detonated,
Lincoln O'Barry said.

<HEAD>Thousands Arrested For Looting in Peru's Capital, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers and police have arrested almost 7,000
people for looting since the government of new President Alberto
Fujimori announced a severe austerity program, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   At least 12 people were wounded by gunfire as security forces
clashed with looters in dozens of markets in Peru's shantytowns and
poor neighborhoods, the daily La Republica reported.
   The military joint command would not comment on the report.
   The looting broke out Thursday, immediately after the new
government sharply raised prices. Gasoline prices jumped from seven
cents to more than $2. The cost of many basic foods tripled or
quadrupled.
   Telephone, water and electricity rates will rise, as will taxes
on the rich.
   Fujimori, who took office July 28, has made reducing inflation a
primary goal of his austerity program aimed at bringing the country
out of its economic crisis. Inflation has been running at 3,000
percent annually.
   The austerity measures eliminate the price subsidies for basic
goods. Such subsidies have been largely responsible for a huge
budget deficit, which the government has covered by printing money.
   To soften the effects of the program, Fujimori has proposed
giving food directly to the poor. But the government has been slow
in setting up soup kitchens, leading to panic in many shantytowns.

   The Navy on Saturday christened the
Kentucky, its newest Trident submarine, with a bottle of blended
bourbon from the Bluegrass State.
   The Kentucky, with a crew of 154, is to serve as an undersea
intercontinental missile-launching platform. It will be
commissioned next year.
   Carolyn Hopkins, the wife Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky., smashed
a commemorative bottle of whiskey blended from eight Kentucky
distilleries over the hull of the 560-foot, 18,750-ton boat.
   Groton police said 10 anti-nuclear protesters were arrested at
the site and released Saturday afternoon.
   The Electric Boat division of General Dynamics has delivered 10
of the ships and is close to delivering an 11th, the West Virginia.
Seven more Tridents are under construction.
   Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. in Newport News, Va.,
also makes nuclear submarines.
   The submarine Kentucky will be the third U.S. Naval vessel to be
named in honor of the Bluegrass State. The first was a Confederate
transport; the second a battleship decommissioned in 1920.

   Mayor Marion Barry urged federal prosecutors
to abandon any thought of retrying him on drug and perjury charges
and political allies said Saturday he will seek election to the
city council next November.
   ``Now is the time for healing,'' Barry told cheering supporters.
   Of the jury that convicted him Friday on one charge, acquitted
him on another and was deadlocked on 12 more, Barry said, ``Let
their judgment be our last judgment.''
   In an emotional speech before some 500 people _ many of them
chanting, ``Four More years!'' _ Barry did not directly address his
own political future. Nor did he say whether he would appeal his
conviction on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession.
   But top political aides to the mayor, speaking on condition of
anonymity a few hours later, said Barry will run for a city council
seat.
   ``The man's life is politics, and now that this trial is over,
he has decided he will run for the council,'' said one top adviser
who spoke with Barry after the speech Saturday. ``This allows him
to keep his hand in local politics, earn a living, and redeem
himself.''
   But in his appearance, which blended elements of a campaign
rally and a revival meeting, the mayor avoided discussing politics
and instead apologized to the city's residents, ``young and old,
black and white, Jew and gentile,'' and he asked them to ``forgive
me for any hurt I may have caused. ... I hope that any of you who
still harbor resentment and vengeance can let go.''
   Barry had said repeatedly before the trial that he was being
targeted for investigation in part because he is a prominent black
leader.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens has not announced whether he will
seek to retry the mayor on charges that the jury could not decide.
Among them are three perjury counts and a cocaine possession charge
backed by videotaped evidence of the mayor smoking crack cocaine in
an FBI sting operation Jan. 18 at the Vista Intercontinental Hotel.
He was arrested that night.
   ``Now is the time for healing,'' Barry said. ``I call on the
United States government to join in this healing.''
   Barry, 54, announced earlier that he would not seek re-election
to a fourth term as Democratic mayor of the nation's capital this
year. But close associates confirmed that he plans to run for the
13-member council. He served on the city council from 1974 until he
was elected to his first mayoral term in 1978.
   Barry will make the first formal step of his candidacy when he
changes his party affiliation from Democrat to independent on
Monday, the political sources said. That move will qualify him for
the November general election, where he will face the winners of
Republican, Democrat and Statehood party primaries in September.
They said he would seek one of two at-large council seats being
contested; the top two vote-getters will be elected.
   In his remarks, Barry said he realized he had been ``behaving in
ways that were not in keeping with the vows I made to my wife'' and
he asked for her forgiveness. ``She has granted it,'' he said.
   He reviewed his well-publicized treatment for what he said was
alcohol and prescription drug abuse.
   ``There's no shame or disgrace in being addicted to anything,''
he said. ``The shame and disgrace is in not making the decision to
seek help. ... I could have believed I was bigger and badder than
anything in this world.... But the quiet voice of God whispered to
me and said, `Take my hand.'''
   Barry, whose remarks shifted in turn from contrition to
confrontation, had a few pointed remarks for prosecutors, saying,
``The U.S. government must examine its conduct to see if it's been
in keeping with its responsibilities.''
   It was in everyone's interest, he said, to ``insist that the
government guard against a tendency to overreach in its zeal, its
zest to make a point.''
   ``I'm relieved that this trial is over,'' Barry said as he
launched into criticism of the news media for what he considered
excessive coverage of his case.
   ``Enough is enough,'' he said, and the audience picked up the
chant, echoing, ``Enough is enough.''
   Barry spoke as others also urged prosecutors not to seek a
retrial.
   ``We are trying simply to say to the government that there is a
time when both sides must step back from the battle lines that were
drawn,'' said Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy. ``It is not
cowardly to do so.''
   ``We can think of no legitimate reason for the government to go
to the expense and the resulting trauma of another trial,'' said
Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP. ``We hope this
brings this sad, sad saga to a close.''
   The mayor faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a
$100,000 fine for his conviction on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine
possession. He has not said whether he will appeal. U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has not yet set a sentencing date.
   Barry retained the support of about 20 percent of the city's
electorate, according to recent polls, despite the six-week trial
in which prosecutors portrayed him as a regular cocaine user and a
womanizer.
   Jurors in the case said they split down the middle on most of
the deadlocked charges, including the one that arose from an FBI
sting operation that videotaped Barry smoking crack cocaine.
   One juror, Johnnie Mae Hardeman, said the panel doubted the
truthfulness and motives of Barry's chief accusers, who were
themselves drug users.
   Some prominent civil rights leaders had suggested that Barry was
targeted for prosecution because he is black, and Hooks quickly
urged the government to abandon its case. George Stallings, a
locally prominent black priest who was excommunicated after
starting his own congregation, echoed Hooks' sentiments and
suggested Jackson issue a light sentence in view of the jury's
failure to convict Barry on multiple counts.
   While future prosecution of the mayor remains in doubt, Barry
has no legal obstacles preventing him from running for office now.
Under city law, Barry would have been barred from office if he had
been convicted of any of the three felony perjury charges he faced,
but there is no such prohibition based on the misdemeanor
conviction.

   The Food and Drug Administration has approved
major new clinical trials for a controversial drug believed to
prolong the lives of AIDS victims and persons infected with the
AIDS virus, officials said Saturday.
   FDA spokesman Brad Stone confirmed that HEM Research Inc. of
Philadelphia, will conduct a double-blind study using the
anti-viral compound Ampligen beginning next month. About 135
patients in as many as eight cities will participate and neither
the doctors nor patients will know who is receiving the drug or the
placebo.
   HEM's chief scientist William A. Carter is a co-inventor of the
new drug.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus,
now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, discovered in
France and the United States. The virus is spread through contact
with blood or with semen from infected persons.
   Ampligen is designed to stimulate the body's production of
interferon, a substance used by the immune system to fight viral
infections.
   The only antiviral drug approved currently to treat AIDS is AZT.
This drug originally was known as azidothymidine, but is now called
zidovudine, and is marketed by Burroughs Wellcome Co. as Retrovir.
   During the study, Ampligen will be administered in conjunction
with AZT.
   In its only other study major study two years ago, Ampligen
failed to work on about 300 men at hospitals in seven cities. This
time, officials said, doctors will try to determine whether
Ampligen can help patients maintain a healthy level of special
cells that regulate the immune system rendered inactivated by the
AIDS virus.
   FDA officials said that generally AZT has been shown to keep the
level of T4 cells at acceptable levels for several months, after
which the levels decline. Ampligen is expected to continue working
long after AZT has stopped, and lessen AZT side effects such as
severe headaches, gastrointestinal disorders and nausea.
   HEM officials said initial results will be released in the fall
of 1991.

   The father of a newborn boy whose dismembered
body was eaten by the family's German shepherd was charged with
murdering the infant in a fit of anger over a wet diaper, police
said Saturday.
   Jason Radtke, 19, who had just moved here from a small town in
Nebraska, was charged late Friday with two counts of second-degree
murder, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a police spokesman.
   No charges were filed against the infant's mother, Radtke's
common-law wife Linda Boyce, 19.
   The boy, Anthony Radtke, was born Aug. 4.
   Mohrmann said police believe Anthony's crying early Friday
awakened Radtke, who took the baby out of a dresser drawer the
couple used as a makeshift crib. The infant urinated on Radtke, and
the father threw him to the ground, Capt. John Creegan said.
   He cut the baby up and left the remains in a position so the dog
_ a 3-year-old named Appoll _ could consume it, Creegan said.
Police believe Radtke used a razor, but no weapon has been found,
he said.
   The couple called police Friday morning to report the infant was
missing. They said they had put him to sleep about midnight in
their bedroom, police said.
   The couple's 11-month-old daughter, Kayla, was found sleeping
unharmed in her playpen in the living room, police said. She was
placed in the custody of the Bureau of Child Welfare, Creegan said.
There was no indication she had been abused, he added.
   Radtke moved to New York two weeks ago from Alma, Neb., to
fulfill his dream of becoming a dog trainer, police said. He
attended the K-9 Behavioral Science Center, a dog-training school
in the Queens borough where the couple lived, said Anthony Malardi,
the school's manager.
   Radtke bought the German shepherd two months ago for $3,500,
said Jerry Sukeforth, owner of Sukee Kennels in Warren, Maine.
Radtke wanted the dog to help start his trainer's career, Sukeforth
said.
   Detectives took Appoll to an Animal Hospital in Manhattan to be
X-rayed. The dog was put to sleep and a necropsy showed the baby
was killed before he was eaten, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman
for the Medical Examiner.
   The Radtkes moved to New York City from Alma, a farming town of
1,200 about 200 miles southwest of Lincoln, Neb., where they had
worked at an ice cream shop, Alma Sheriff Ron Early said.
   Radtke had a criminal record that included petty theft and
simple assault, Creegan said.
   The murder counts against Radtke included one for intentional
murder and one for depraved indifference, police said.

   British fighter jets and Egyptian and Moroccan soldiers arrived
in Saudi Arabia on Saturday as warships from several nations headed
to the Persian Gulf to join American forces in trying to deter
further Iraqi aggression.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Syria also was sending
troops to join an Arab umbrella force being mobilized by the Arab
League.
   It was unclear whether the Arab troops would operate
independently of the U.S.-led multinational force or whether the
two forces would coordinate their operations.
   Both forces want to prevent further attacks by Iraq, which
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed it Wednesday.
   Up to 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to arrive in Saudi Arabia
in the coming weeks, the largest American mobilization since the
Vietnam War. U.S. officials said as many as 250,000 troops could be
sent, depending on the scope of the Iraqi threat.
   Many American troops were taking up positions in Saudi Arabia's
far northeast, near the Kuwaiti border, facing an Iraqi occupation
force in Kuwait estimated at between 130,000 and 170,000 men.
   The Arab League decided Friday night to send its own troops to
Saudi Arabia, but the size and members of the force have not been
announced. The first of 10,000 troops from Egypt and Morocco landed
Saturday.
   Mubarak told BBC-TV news in London that Syria would also send
troops. Egypt and Syria boast the largest Arab armies after Iraq's.
   ``We have already taken the decision in the summit to help our
friends with Arab forces and we are going to do it, and Syria also
is going to do it ...'' Mubarak said.
   Mubarak, announcing earlier that his advance troops had been
deployed on Saturday, said they are battle-ready and will fight
``if someone launches an aggression.''
   As part of the multinational effort, Britain announced that a
squadron of Tornado fighter jets arrived in Saudi Arabia from
Cyprus and a squadron of Jaguar warplanes was heading for Oman from
Britain. Each squadron has about 12 planes.
   More than 1,000 British servicemen are being deployed to the
region in ``Operation Granby,'' Britain's biggest military
deployment since the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina.
   The first of three British Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft will
leave Scotland on Sunday and three Royal Navy minesweepers depart
for the gulf on Monday, the Ministry of Defense said.
   The destroyer HMS York, already in the gulf region, was joined
Saturday by the frigate HMS Jupiter. The frigate HMS Battleaxe is
expected to arrive Sunday, the Ministry of Defense said.
   The United States already has nine ships in the gulf, seven in
the Mediterranean, and aircraft carriers and their battlegroups in
the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.
   Canada is contributing two destroyers and a supply ship to the
multinational force, Denmark is making ships available, and West
Germany is sending four or five minesweepers to the eastern
Mediterranean which might be available for duty in the Gulf.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said Friday that two
frigates and a supply ship would leave within five days and would
be in the gulf in about three weeks.
   Italian Defense Minister Virginio Rognoni said Saturday that
Italian military forces would be ready to go into action
immediately if the government decides to contribute to the
multinational force.
   France and the Soviet Union have already sent ships to the gulf
independent of the multinational force.
   The Soviets have two warships in the gulf, which they say are to
protect Soviet shipping. The Soviets say they will consider joining
a blockade against Iraq only if the United Nations calls for one.
   French President Francois Mitterrand announced Thursday his
nation was increasing its naval and air forces in the gulf to seven
ships and 3,200 military personnel.
   NATO foreign ministers pledged to defend Turkey, a NATO member,
if the country is attacked by neighboring Iraq. Turkish leaders
said Saturday they were taking defensive precautions.
   The Turkish Air Force has moved several squadrons of jet
fighters to forward bases near the Iraqi border and troops in that
area have been put in a state of readiness.
   Turkey on Thursday gave permission for U.S. forces to launch
attacks against Iraq from Turkish bases in the event of war.

   A group of 32 foreign men, women and
children, mostly Americans and Britons, escaped across the desert
from Kuwait with the help of Bedouin guides, reaching Bahrain on
Saturday, a newspaper reported.
   One woman in the group told the Gulf Daily News that she knew of
at least four foreign women who were raped by Iraqi soldiers in
Kuwait.
   The English-language newspaper, in its Sunday edition, said the
32 escapees included British, American and Irish expatriate workers
and family members as well as one Singapore citizen and a Filipino
woman. The group included 11 women and seven children.
   The escapees were led by John Carlough, of Los Angeles, general
manager in the consumer division of the Gulf Bank in Kuwait, who
fled with his family, the paper said. He said his major regret was
that he had brought his two children to Kuwait for the summer
holidays.
   Using Bedouin guides, who live in the desert and knew where to
cross the expanses to avoid Iraqi soldiers, the group crossed the
border into Saudi Arabia in a convoy of eight four-wheel drive
vehicles, the newspaper said. They then traveled on to the island
nation of Bahrain.
   It was not known when they fled Kuwait.
   Carlough and his family, as well as an American couple, were
apparently spirited away by U.S. Embassy officials after arriving
in Bahrain. The embassy said they would contact reporters if they
wanted to.
   The group did not reveal their desert route in order to keep the
information from the Iraqis. They said they gave a list of
foreigners left behind to their guide drivers in the hope they
would help others.
   Bob Grimstead from Bexley, England, was quoted as saying the
Bedouins ``could pinpoint a needle in the dark. They knew all the
dunes and rocks. They were brilliant.''
   The convoy had to travel through deep sand dunes from which the
cars had to be hauled out, the report said.
   ``The only time we got really frightened was when we had to pull
out one vehicle and two tanks came over the dune,'' said Alan
Jones, of Selsdon, England.
   ``We saw the gun turrets move and it was terrifying. We were
only five minutes from the border and we really thought that was
it. But they didn't fire and they left us. I don't know why,'' he
told the newspaper.
   Deedie McKenzie, who escaped with her husband and three
children, told of rapes committed by Iraqi troops, who invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   She said a West German neighbor, in her 30s, came screaming to
her home after being raped by an Iraqi soldier.
   ``He came into their flat, pointed a gun, and locked the husband
in the bathroom,'' said Ms. McKenzie, whose nationality was not
given. ``The soldier raped the woman and when he had finished, sat
down and had a cup of tea. He then offered money to the couple, and
stole a gold cross before leaving.''
   They reported the rape to the Iraqis who promised that if the
soldier was found he would be shot. Ms McKenzie said she also knew
of rape incidents involving two Filipino women at the SAS hotel and
a British woman.
   The escapees told the newspaper that the Iraqi army was
generally very disorganized, with some of the troops as young as 17
or 18.
   ``They didn't know why they were there and apologized to
Kuwaitis,'' said one of the escapees. ``They had been told that
their families would be shot if they did not join the army. They
were told that there had been a rebellion and the Iraqi army had
been called to help.''
   The Iraqi soldiers also admitted they were scared of the
Americans, they said. ``They had no idea why they were there. They
were scared to their pants of the Americans,'' Jones was quoted as
saying.

<TEXT>
   A Las Vegas showman was awarded $4.2 million
Saturday in his defamation lawsuit against an animal rights group
that secretly filmed him striking his orangutans.
   ``Thank you America,'' Bobby Berosini said as he left the
courtroom.
   ``He'll never see a penny of that money,'' responded Philip
Hirschkop, an attorney for the Washington, D.C.-based People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).
   Hirschkop promised to appeal the award, handed down late
Saturday afternoon by a state jury after three days of
deliberations.
   PETA was assessed $2 million in damages on counts of invasion of
privacy and defamation. PETA investigator Jeanne Roush and former
Stardust Hotel employee Ottavio Gesmundo each were assessed $1
million in damages on the same charges.
   Gesmundo videotaped scenes of Berosini, who does an act with his
orangutans at the Stardust Hotel, striking the beasts before going
on stage with them for July 1989 performances.
   The videotapes were circulated to animal rights groups,
including PETA and the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) of
Galt, Calif. Members of those two groups took the tapes to local
and national media, including the television show, ``Entertainment
Tonight.''
   Berosini claimed the adverse publicity damaged his career. Early
in the month-long trial attorneys said they would seek up to $80
million in damages from PETA, PAWS and seven individuals.
   The jury found the defendants innocent of actual malice and
declined to award punitive damages in the case.
   PAWS and the group's president, Pat Derby, were each assessed
$100,000 in damages for defamation and invasion of privacy.
   Berosini had defended his treatment of the primates, saying they
had been spooked by dancers in the show. He was filmed striking the
animals with a stick.
   Animal rights activists descended on Las Vegas, picketing in
front of the Stardust and encouraging the public to pass up the
show. Berosini claimed the actions hurt his career in Las Vegas and
commercial opportunities in Hollywood.
   He continues to headline at the Stardust and hurried from the
courthouse Saturday, saying ``I've got to go take care of the kids.
We've got to perform tonight.''
   Berosini's legal costs are at least $200,000 to date, according
to one of his attorneys, Harold Gewerter.
   ``Bobby came here for vindication and he got it,'' Gewerter said.

   The IRS says it has decided not to exhume the
body of an Iranian businessman who allegedly owed the government
$157,000 when he died.
   The U.S. attorney's office earlier said it might want to dig up
the body of Ehsanolla Motaghed, 66, just to make sure he's dead.
   ``This is a victory for the little people and a loss for the
Internal Revenue Service,'' attorney James Martin Davis said Friday
of the government's decision not to exhume Motaghed, who was
accused of paying an Internal Revenue Service agent $4,000 to
reduce his tax liability.
   Motaghed died at his Omaha apartment June 9, before he went to
trial on the charge. Davis asked that the indictment against
Motaghed be dismissed and $110,000 in U.S. Treasury notes posted as
his bail be returned.
   Federal authorities first sought to reopen Motaghed's grave to
make a positive identification that Motaghed was buried there. But
a document filed last week in U.S. District Court indicated the
U.S. Attorney's Office does not dispute Motaghed's death and will
not resist Davis' request to dismiss the indictment.
   First Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Thalken said his office had
received information that ``convinced us that the person who
allegedly was dead is dead.''
   The court document, filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert
Kokrda, cited a levy against Motaghed's property for unpaid taxes
totalling $157,869 for the 1985, 1986 and 1987 tax years. He said
the levy was appropriate since Motaghed now is deceased.
   Kokrda asserted that the Treasury notes put up as Motaghed's
bond should be turned over to the IRS. Magistrate Richard Kopf
scheduled a hearing on the matter for Thursday morning.
   Davis said the case was ``almost heartless in terms of what they
have done to the family'' of Motaghed.
   ``That's about as inhumane as anything the Ayatollah might do,
and they fled from the Ayatollah,'' Davis said. Motaghed came to
the United States 12 years ago after being expelled from Iran by
the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Motaghed ran an optical lens importing business. When he was
arraigned, the U.S. Attorney's office said his assets were between
$750,000 and $1 million.

   Saudi Arabian anti-aircraft guns fired at two Iraqi planes near
the border with Kuwait on Saturday, diplomatic sources said. The
reported firing came after Egyptian and Moroccan troops landed to
join the U.S. buildup to protect Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said ``there is no hope'' for a
peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Also Saturday, a 10-year-old California girl was one of 11
Americans who fled to safety in Jordan from Iraq.
   The Saudis fired about 10 rounds at two reconnaisance planes in
the Khafji region close to the border to deter them, according to
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They said the
planes turned back without crossing the border.
   A Saudi official denied the incident took place and said ``the
first bullet will not be from Saudi Arabia.'' The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Iraq denied any of its planes crossed the border but did not say
whether any of its aircraft came under fire.
   Iraq's official radio quoted a spokesman as saying the reports
were ``some sort of prattle and buffoonery propagated by the
suspect quarters that are seeking to undermine great Iraq or to
attack it.''
   Worldwide sanctions tightened a vise around Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, whose call for an Arab ``holy war'' against Saudi
Arabia was met instead with Arab forces arriving to defend it. Iraq
said it would execute any citizens that sells food on the black
market.
   Syria and Iran, both enemies of Iraq, supported Friday's
decision of 12 of 21 Arab League members to send troops, and
President Hosni Mubarak said Saturday that Syria was sending in a
force. The Soviet Union also supported the Arab League decision,
hoping it would lead to ``a speedy resolution to the crisis.''
   President Bush, beginning a three-week vacation in
Kennebunkport, Me., praised the Arab action at a news conference.
   ``It must make Saddam Hussein realize how isolated he is in
terms of world opinion,'' said Bush, who took a boat ride in the
rain Saturday. ``The world is united against him.''
   A belligerent Saddam, who said he holds the Saudis responsible
for Arab disunity, now faces a growing multinational military force
of ground and naval power. And his oil flow, vital to its ability
to import food, has been virtually cut off by a U.N. condemnation
of Iraq's Aug. 2 blitzkrieg and absorption of Kuwait.
   In Cairo, Mubarak was asked if believed there is a possibility
of a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf crisis. ``I want to tell
you honestly _ and note that I am always optimistic _ there is no
hope of that,'' Mubarak said.
   There were also indications that Iraq is preparing for a world
economic seige. The Ruling Economic Command Council warned that
selling food on the black market would be a criminal act of
sabotage punishable by death.
   In a statement broadcast Saturday, the council said the decision
was taken to ``provide enough foodstuffs to all citizens and foil
the cheats and the greedy ones.''
   The state-run radio also said ``enraged Baghdad masses'' mobbed
the Saudi Arabian and Egyptian embassies. The radio said the
protesters ``chanted death to the enemies of Iraq and the Arab
nation, the inheritors of colonialist doctrine and protectors of
Zionism who are protecting their thrones with the bayonets of
foreign troops.''
   Iraq had sealed its borders after its lightning invasion,
trapping 3,500 Americans and other foreigners.
   But Penelope Nabokov, 10, of Albany, Calif., crossed the
Iraqi-Jordanian frontier after a 660-mile overland journey. She was
flying unaccompanied from France to India when she was taken into
custody by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait during a stopover. She was
later brought to Baghdad with 10 other Americans.
   The girl's father, Peter Nabokov, said she was ``in
phenomenonally good spirits.''
   The Americans who crossed into Jordan included non-essential
U.S. Embassy staff and dependents, border officials said.
   It was unclear how the Egyptian and Morrocan troops would be
deployed with American soldiers, but all the forces were landing at
the same northeastern Saudi base.
   The Pentagon has committed 50,000 ground troops but the number
could skyrocket if Iraq invades with forces massed on the
Kuwait-Saudi border.
   Egypt and Morocco were each expected to provide 5,000 troops,
according to diplomatic sources who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. They were under the flag of their respective countries.
Cairo Radio called them ``an Arab umbrella to safeguard the
region.''
   The troop deployment set off demonstrations Saturday in Yemen,
Libya, Jordan and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Thousands of
people rallied in front of the the American, Saudi Arabian and
Egyptian embassies in the Yemeni capital, San`a, in support of
Saddam.
   In the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians also marched in
support of Iraq, shouting ``We are with you, Saddam!'' Arab
reporters said.
   No other U.S. allies have committed ground forces, but a naval
aramada is muscling up in an effort to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   The United States already has nine ships in the Persian Gulf,
seven in the Mediterranean, and three aircraft carriers and their
battlegroups in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.
   Britain committed two fighter aircraft squadrons, anti-aircraft
missiles and other air and sea forces totaling more than 1,000 men
to the gulf area. Australia, Canada and West Germany promised
ships. Denmark said it would make ships available, and Spain was
considering sending a frigate.
   France and the Soviet Union sent ships to the gulf independent
of the multinational force.
   Pressure also came from countries bordering Iraq.
   Turkey moved F-16 fighter jets and other warplanes near its
border with Iraq, Turkish newspapers reported, and the
semi-official Anatolia news agency said Iraq had moved
anti-aircraft weaponry into place on its side of the frontier.
   Syria's state-run radio praised Arab leaders' decision to send
troops to Saudi Arabia to defend it from possible Iraqi attack,
calling it ``an achievement that reflects a determined Arab stand
toward one of the most dangerous crises ever faced by the Arab
world.''
   Syria has feuded with Iraq for a decade and supported Iran in
the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Meanwhile, Iran's state-run radio said Tehran was willing to
cooperate with other Persian Gulf states to seek a peaceful end to
Iraqi aggression and urged a regional solution that would exclude
the United States.
   ``Iran is prepared for any kind of cooperation with the
countries of the region which may restore peace and tranquility and
prevent the presence and influence of the superpowers in the
Persian Gulf,'' the radio said.
   Iran was the first producer in the region to make up for the
shortfall of oil caused by the boycott of Iraq. Iran has sold
millions of barrels of oil from storage tanks, according to the New
York Times.
   Iraq's oil spigot has been cut off by an international embargo,
according to oil sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

   Penelope Nabokov, a 10-year-old California
girl stranded in Kuwait when Iraq invaded, reached freedom in
Jordan Saturday after a grueling 72-hour, 660-mile desert journey
with 10 other Americans.
   Her father described her as ``in phenomenally good spirits.''
   Penelope left late Saturday for Paris aboard an Air France
airliner.
   Thousands of Americans were trapped in Iraq and Kuwait by the
Aug. 2 invasion, but the plight of Penelope, who was traveling
alone when she was detained, captured the most public attention.
   At the time of the invasion, she was flying unaccompanied from
France to India, where her mother was doing research. The British
Airways flight had a stopover in Kuwait, where the passengers were
taken into custody by Iraqi soldiers.
   Later, Penelope was brought to Baghdad with some of the
passengers from the plane.
   The 11 Americans, who included some non-essential personnel from
the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and their dependents, drove in several
cars from the Iraqi capital to the Jordanian border outpost of
Ruweishid on Saturday.
   There, they were met by U.S. officials. Penelope was allowed to
pass the Jordanian border post without any formalities and left for
Amman by car with a female U.S. Embassy staffer.
   The rest of the group made the five-hour, 210-mile trip by
embassy bus.
   On arriving in the Jordanian capital, they got off the bus and
hurried into a hotel without speaking to reporters. One woman had
two dogs on a leash.
   In her hometown of Albany, Calif., her father, Peter Nabokov,
said he had talked to his daughter by telephone.
   ``She was in phenomenally good spirits, well spoken, describing
everything with a reporter's memory,'' Nabokov told reporters
outside City Hall in the Oakland suburb.
   ``I asked her if she was OK, and she said, `Well, Dad, how would
you feel if you had been driving across the desert for 72 hours?'''
   Nabokov said he plans to fly to Paris where he will meet up with
his wife, Isabelle, and daughter on Sunday.
   At the U.S. Embassy in Amman, spokesman Jonathan Owen said the
evacuees were exhausted and did not want to talk about their
experience.
   On Wednesday, Iraq sealed its borders to all foreigners except
Arab citizens and diplomats.
   ``We are trying to get other Americans out of Iraq but we don't
know when others will arrive,'' Owen said.
   In Bahrain, a group of 32 foreign men, women and children,
mostly Americans and Britons, arrived in Manama on Saturday after
escaping across the desert from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia with the
help of Bedouin guides, the English-language Gulf Daily News
reported in its Sunday edition.
   The newspaper said the escapees included British, American and
Irish expatriate workers and family members as well as one
Singapore citizen and a Filipino woman. The group, which included
11 women and seven children, reportedly fled in a convoy of eight
four-wheel drive vehicles.
   President Bush on Friday expressed concern about the 3,500
Americans detained in Iraq and Kuwait, but stopped short of calling
the Americans hostages.
   On Friday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III condemned as
``beyond all international norms'' Iraq's refusal to permit some
the Americans and other foreigners to leave Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``The United States is very disturbed about the restrictions on
the freedom of travel,'' Baker said Friday in Brussels, where he
attended a NATO gathering.
   He said diplomatic contacts were continuing in an effort to
secure their freedom.
   Five West Germans arrived at the Jordanian border post of
Ruweishid at the same time as the American group on Saturday,
officials reported.
   In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said he had no information
on the West Germans but said perhaps they worked for one of the
multinational companies in Iraq.
   The spokesman said there are about 600 West Germans there,
mostly businessmen and their families.
   In London, the British Foreign Office said Saturday that 28
Britons had contacted British embassies in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain
after making their way out of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. A spokesman
said he had no details how they managed to leave the country.
   France summoned the Iraqi ambassador in Paris on Saturday to
seek assurances that French citizens in Iraq and Kuwait are not
being held hostage or prisoner.
   Italy delivered a strong protest Saturday to the Iraqi
ambassador over what it called the blocking of foreigners trying to
leave. It warned that the European Community was holding Baghdad
responsible for their safety.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Iraq has agreed to
permit all 880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave, but only by road, via
the Iraq-Jordan border.
   The news agency did not say how many of the nearly 8,000 Soviets
in Iraq were being allowed to leave. The evacuation was already
being organized, the report said.

   President Bush's handling of the current Middle
East crisis boosted his approval rating among Americans to 75
percent, the second-highest total since he took office, a Newsweek
poll released Saturday shows.
   An overwhelming percentage of Americans _ 93 percent _ felt U.S.
oil companies were taking advantage of the Middle East uprising to
unfairly raise gasoline prices, the poll showed.
   It also showed 94 percent of Americans supported military
retaliation if Iraqi troops struck against U.S. troops; 79 percent
favored a U.S. strike if the Iraqis killed U.S. civilians in Kuwait
or Iraq; and 61 percent backed a strike if the Iraqis took American
hostages.
   Three out of four Americans believed it was at least somewhat
likely that the U.S. forces in the Middle East will engage in
combat with Iraqi troops, the Newsweek poll said.
   A separate poll by The New York Times poll found that about half
of Americans expect a bloodless resolution to the confrontation,
but a third said they anticipated fighting. The rest said they did
not know what would unfold.
   The Newsweek poll showed that 58 percent were opposed to a
covert assassination of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
   Bush's rating was his second-highest since Newsweek began
gauging his approval rate in May 1989. Last month, his approval
stood at 65 percent, with 26 percent disapproval; only 15 percent
disapproved now, the poll showed.
   The Gallup Organization conducted a telephone survey of 770
adults on Aug. 9-10. The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus
4 percentage point.
   In the Times poll, published Sunday, 66 percent approved of
sending troops to Saudi Arabia and 28 percent disapproved.
   That poll found 50 percent of Americans believed Bush had
clearly explained why troops were sent to Saudi Arabia, and 41
percent said the reasons were not explained clearly.
   Those polled were roughly divided when asked if they thought
entering the Middle East conflict was like getting involved in
Vietnam in the 1960s. Forty-two percent said that was a good
comparison, 52 percent said it was not.
   The New York Times poll of 670 adults was taken by telephone on
Thursday and Friday. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.

<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yosemite National Park's
spectacular sights, normally enjoyed by up to 25,000 visitors on
summer weekends, were clouded by smoke Saturday as 14,000 acres
burned on the park's west side.
   ``There's next to nobody here,'' Don Fox of the U.S. Park
Service said at Yosemite Valley, location of the El Capitan and
Half Dome rock masses and other much-photographed attractions.
   Yosemite was closed Friday after the first summertime evacuation
in its 100-year history.
   ``It sounded like jet engines,'' said Debbie Brossman, a
bartender who evacuated her home Friday in nearby El Portal when
the fire was within yards of her house. ``This raging wind was
blowing down the hill. The sky turned dark with smoke and ash.''
   ``It's darkness at noon,'' said Dennis Scotty, Brossman's
neighbor. Their houses in El Portal were saved when the wind
shifted, allowing firefighters to set ``backfires'' that met the
oncoming flames.
   All told, more than 175,000 acres were burning in northern
California, with 14 fires classified as major and hundreds of
smaller ones being watched.
   More than 116,000 acres of forest land have burned in Oregon in
recent days, and more than 90,000 acres burned in Idaho. Fires have
also hit Utah and Washington.
   About 11,000 firefighters were working on the California lines,
mostly in pine forests. The largest fire, in Tehama County, had
burned 106,000 acres by Saturday afternoon, the California
Department of Forestry reported.
   The U.S. Forest Service requested help from the military on
Saturday and was told that three Army battalions would be made
available after undergoing three days of special training in
firefighting.
   Firefighters had contained about 10 percent of each Yosemite
blaze, one 9,200 acres, and the other 5,000 acres. The fires were
both about 10 miles west of Yosemite Valley, the park's most
heavily visited area and site of the famous Bridalveil Falls,
Halfdome and El Capitan. The valley was closed although officials
said there was little smoke there Saturday.
   ``For a lot of tourists, one of their lifelong ambitions was to
see Yosemite. Some barely got there and were turned out,'' said
Denise LeDuc, a service station operator in Mariposa, 30 miles west
of the park.
   More than 10,000 visitors were sent out of the park Friday. The
valley's sleeping facilities, including campgrounds, for 8,000 were
virtually unused overnight.
   ``We are sad, very much, because for us, in France, we don't see
sequoia trees,'' said Maite Letertri, a member of a French tour
group.
   Most of the California fires were started by lightning,
officials said; some 23,490 lightning strikes were counted in the
state by electronic detection equipment between Aug. 3 and Friday.
A fourth straight year of drought has increased the risk of fires
almost throughout the state.
   ``The good news today is that there were no lightning strikes
overnight, and there shouldn't be any for several days now,'' Lisa
Boyd of the California Department of Forestry said.
   The flames of the California fires destroyed 77 structures _
from outbuildings to homes _ including 66 in the town of Foresta
along the Merced River Canyon near Yosemite.
   A National Guard helicopter crashed Friday evening while
scooping up water out of a Tehema County pond. Staff Sgt. Milo
Laguna, the crew chief, suffered minor injuries, but the pilot and
co-pilot escaped unharmed. The crash's cause was not immediately
determined.
   Firefighters were spread thin in many spots. An 18-person crew
was fighting a 2,500-acre wildfire in the King Mountain Range, a
federal wilderness area on the northern California coast that
includes habitat of the endangered spotted owl.
   Two crews were overrun by fire Friday, one in Yosemite and
another in the Sequoia National Forest, but all escaped serious
injury by scrambling into heat-resistant tents.
   In eastern Oregon, firefighters held their own Saturday in
efforts to corral forest and range fires burning across more than
116,000 acres.
   Lightning storms continued, with 2,600 strikes reported
overnight. But fire spokesman Doug Decker said the threat from
lightning was abating after five straight nights of 2,000 or more
strikes.
   The lightning started more than 100 fires each day, but most
were controlled.
   More than 6,500 firefighters were on the lines in Oregon
Saturday. Crews from at least 16 states in the South and East
helped out.
   Decker said the state's most troublesome fire was along the
southern side of the Strawberry Mountain Wilderness southeast of
John Day in the Malheur National Forest. The fire burned actively
through the night, growing from 9,000 acres to nearly 11,000 acres,
Decker said.
   In Idaho, hundreds of firefighters labored to dig containment
lines around forest and range fires, but thunderstorms crackling
overhead in the central mountains promised yet another round of
blazes.
   Temperatures dropped below earlier highs over 100 in southern
Idaho and some heavy rain even fell Friday night in the Payette
National Forest north of Boise, although 19 new lightning-caused
blazes began.
   Some 160 firefighters and air retardant tankers worked together
Friday to rein in the state's biggest blaze, a 66,000-acre range
fire about 35 miles north of Twin Falls. Officials hoped to contain
it Saturday night, although wind gusts accompanying the storms
could change matters drastically.
   Crews in eastern Washington labored Saturday in 90-degree heat
to fight dozens of small forest fires started by lightning strikes
overnight.
   ``Things are pretty hectic today,'' said Paul Hart, spokesman
for the Wenatchee National Forest where lightning strikes started
up to 40 new fires.
   In Utah, fire bosses called in reinforcements to battle several
brush fires, but at least one fire, a 200-acre blaze near the
Uninta and Ouragy Indian Reservation, has been allowed to burn
unchecked because other blazes in the West have taken precedence.

   Marines and Army air assault troops began
deploying to Saudi Arabia on Saturday to join a rapidly swelling
U.S. military force that is preparing to defend the desert kingdom
from a possible Iraqi attack, officials said.
   Also, Pentagon sources disclosed that Patriot surface-to-air
missiles and other sophisticated air defense hardware were being
sent to Saudi Arabia on the assumption that, in the event of an
Iraqi attack, an initial air battle could be decisive.
   The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said
Patriot high-altitude missiles have never before been deployed in a
military contingency such as the mobilization that has been under
way in Saudi Arabia since Wednesday.
   In addition to the computer-guided Patriots, the United States
is sending Hawk medium-range guided missiles, Chaparral mobile
heat-seeking missiles and Stinger shoulder-held anti-aircraft
missiles, Army sources said. U.S. Stinger missiles already have
arrived there, the sources said.
   The Army also is rushing over Apache attack helicopters and
other weapons capable of knocking out Iraqi tanks, an Army source
said. Tanks would lead any Iraqi thrust into Saudi Arabia.
   ``We're cramming Apaches over there as fast as we can,'' the
source said.
   The U.S. operation is code-named Desert Shield.
   The Pentagon declined to comment on a number of reports that the
aircraft carrier USS Kennedy would be sent to the Mideast from
Norfolk, Va., where it is currently being supplied for a new duty
cruise. A Navy source said deployment to the Mideast could not be
ruled out, but that it would be going too far at this point to say
that such a deployment is likely.
   The Pentagon officially announced that elements of the 1st
Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, Calif., and the
Army's 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., began moving
to embarkation points for the trip to Saudi Arabia.
   The Marine force includes elements of the 7th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade, the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, the 1st Marine
Division and the 1st Force Service Support Group, said Lt. Col. Ron
Stokes, a Marine Corps spokesman. He said a Marine expeditionary
force usually totals 30,000 to 60,000 men.
   Col. Miguel Monteverde, a Pentagon spokesman, said no
information would be provided on the numbers of troops deploying
from Camp Pendleton or Fort Campbell.
   About 40,000 Marines are stationed at Camp Pendleton, 70 miles
south of Los Angeles.
   An Army source said troops from Fort Hood, Texas, also were to
be deployed. He gave no details. News reports in Texas said 1,000
soldiers had been readied for deployment, and that five batteries
from the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Bliss, Texas,
have been ordered to prepare for departure to the gulf.
   The 101st Airborne, with 15,400 troops, has two attack
battalions equipped with 18 AH-64 Apache ground attack helicopters
and 18 AH-1 Cobra anti-tank helicopters. It also has two assault
helicopter battalions, a medium-lift helicopter battalion and an
air cavalry squadron with reconnaissance helicopters.
   The Pentagon, citing security concerns, has refused to say how
many soldiers, airmen and other ground forces have arrived in Saudi
Arabia or where they are setting up their defensive positions.
Sources have said contingency plans call for deploying as many as
250,000 ground troops if Iraq were to attack.
   An Army strategist, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said Pentagon planners already had determined that if Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein were to send his army into Saudi Arabia he
would be limited to two main avenues.
   The most likely path for Iraqi tanks would be the coastal plain
in eastern Saudi Arabia. In that region, along the Persian Gulf
coast, lie Saudi Arabia's main oil fields and the heart of its oil
processing and transportation system. Saudi Arabia's oil reserves,
estimated at 255 billion barrels, are the largest in the world, and
the kingdom is the United States's main foreign supplier of oil.
   The other possible avenue for an Iraqi attack from Kuwait, where
an estimated 200,000 Iraqi troops are massed, is through a crossing
near where the northern Saudi border meets the juncture of the
Kuwaiti and Iraqi borders, the source said.
   President Bush said Friday there is no indication of an imminent
Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia.
   Army planners figure that if Iraq attacked, the U.S. Air Force
would move first to establish air superiority. An unknown number of
F-16 Fighting Falcon planes began arriving in Saudi Arabia on
Friday, and the Pentagon announced Saturday that F-16s were
continuing to arrive from Shaw Air Force Base, S.C.
   The Pentagon also said an unspecified number of C-130 transport
aircraft were continuing to arrive in Saudi Arabia from Pope Air
Force Base, N.C.
   An air battle also would require strong U.S. air defenses to
counter the Iraqi air force, which gained extensive experience
during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   The Pentagon announced on Friday that elements of the 24th
Mechanized Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart, Ga., moved to
the port of Savannah for loading aboard a troopship, the Capella,
for the trip to Saudi Arabia. It also said two hospital ships were
being prepared for active duty in the gulf area.
   Other U.S. forces in the gulf include at least 48 F-15 fighters
and more than 35 naval vessels, including nine ships in the gulf,
two aircraft carrier battle groups in the Arabian Sea or Indian
Ocean and one carrier in the Red Sea.

   Heavy rains from typhoon Winona injured at least 13
people in central Japan Friday and caused railway problems that
affected more than 500,000 people throughout the country, officials
said.
   Officials said Winona moved northeast over Tochigi prefecture,
60 miles north of Tokyo, after dumping more than 20 inches of rain
in western and central Tokyo, flooding 686 houses.
   Police said the storm damaged roads at 19 sites and caused 43
landslides, paralyzing parts of Japan's transportation system.
   The Tokyo Waterworks Bureau lifted restrictions on water use
Friday, bureau spokesman Hideo Higuchi said.
   Tokyo's seven reservoirs quickly recovered more than 20 million
tons of water to reach 36 percent capacity.
   Before the typhoon brought the rain, a hot, dry summer had left
the seven reservoirs serving the capital and portions of five
nearby prefectures with only two weeks of water for the region's 20
million people.
   Heavy rain halted at least five railroad lines in the Tokyo area
and many other lines were delayed, affecting more than a
half-million Japanese, according to East Japan Railways Co.
   The rains also shut down portions of highways near Tokyo and
caused Tokyo's Haneda Airport to cancel more than 62 domestic
flights, officials said.
   A warm-core tropical cyclone is called a typhoon in the western
Pacific when its minimum sustained surface winds are at least 74
mph.

   Suspected leftist guerrillas in a pickup
truck opened fire with submachine guns on a police bus Friday,
killing two officers and wounding four people, authorities said.
   Police later found the body of another man, apparently an
attacker killed when police fired back.
   No one claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, but
police Col. Juan Carlos Salgado called it the work of
``extremists.'' The term is used here to refer to two bands of
urban guerrillas organized years ago to fight the past military
regime of Gen. Augusto Ponochet.
   Four young gunmen sprayed the bus with gunfire during Friday's
attack in La Florida, a working-class district in southern
Santiago. The police bus was hit by at least 40 shots.
   The pickup, reported stolen hours earlier, sped away immediately
after the attack, witnesses said.
   Police said they found the truck abandoned two hours later about
20 blocks away with the body of a man, apparently an attacker, dead
of gunshot wounds in the back seat. Police said the man, in his
late 20s, was wearing a wig.
   In addition to the two slain officers, two policemen and two
civilians were wounded, authorities said.
   Similar attacks were common during Pinochet's 16{-year rule. But
they had virtually ceased after Pinochet was succeeded March 11 by
President Patricio Aylwin, an elected civilian.
   The attack came hours after the government announced it is
increasing the 30,000-member National Police force by 4,500.

   A Mexican doctor accused in the
torture-slaying of an undercover U.S. drug agent must be returned
home because federal agents illegally ordered his kidnapping, a
judge ruled.
   The abduction soured diplomatic relations between the United
States and Mexico, which accused U.S. officials of encroaching on
Mexican sovereignty and threatened to cut off anti-drug cooperation.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was brought from Guadalajara to Los
Angeles in April to face prosecution in the 1985 death of Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ruled Friday the United
States violated its extradition treaty with Mexico when DEA
operatives kidnapped the doctor from his office at gunpoint.

   Red Cross blood services are under a new,
centralized, national management designed to correct problems with
the way blood bank accidents and errors are reported, reviewed and
followed up.
   The Red Cross said Friday it is scrapping its current system of
local control in each of 54 blood services regions, which supply
blood to more than half the hospitals in the United States.
   Instead, each regional program will be run by an officer named
and paid for by the national headquarters _ and the officers will
report to a new senior vice president whose only responsibility
will be the group's $500 million blood bank program, the nation's
largest.
   The Red Cross also announced major expansions at its national
headquarters. The staff responsible for evaluating the local blood
programs and following up on their accident and error reports will
double from eight to 16. And the unit that makes sure the Red Cross
complies with federal regulations will nearly triple from five
people to 14.

   A former top adviser to U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh was indicted on charges he used cocaine
during Thornburgh's five-year rise from Pennsylvania's governor to
the nation's top prosecutor.
   It was the fourth time since May that long-time Thornburgh aides
have fallen from grace. Two were reassigned after deception on FBI
polygraph tests and a third resigned after his security clearance
was revoked.
   Former Justice Department lawyer Henry G. Barr, 47, was charged
Friday with one count of cocaine possession, two counts of making
false statements and one count of conspiracy.
   The indictment returned by a grand jury in Harrisburg accuses
Barr of using cocaine from December 1984 to January 1988, and again
on April 8, 1989 _ about one month before he resigned his federal
post and resumed private practice.

   An electrician whose faulty work caused
a house fire in which a 12-year-old boy died was sentenced to five
years in prison.
   National trade groups said the case marked the first time an
electrician was found criminally liable for work that caused a
fatal fire. The judge also called it a unique case.
   Richard E. Salz, 49, was convicted in June of second-degree
manslaughter in the death of Burton Gorman III, who died of smoke
inhalation in a 1988 house fire in the neighboring town of East
Haven.
   In passing sentence Friday, Superior Court Judge Joseph T.
Gormley Jr. said he found disturbing Salz's unwillingness to accept
any blame for the fire. He also ordered Salz to serve five years'
probation after his prison term.
   Defense attorney James Ullman said that, at most, Salz was
guilty of sloppy workmanship. He said the verdict would be appealed.

   It's a late-summer film festival for the
Sheen brothers, with Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen starring in
three films, including one together.
   The two sons of Martin Sheen co-star in Epic Productions' ``Men
at Work,'' which Emilio also wrote and directed. He repeats his
role as Billy the Kid in Fox's ``Young Guns II,'' and Charlie plays
a hot-shot commando in Orion's ``Navy SEALS.''
   Their father changed his name from Estevez to Sheen. Emilio
chose to use the family name in his career.
   The brothers are a strange pair for brothers. Estevez, 27, is
blond, with Spanish-looking features, reflective, serious; Sheen is
taller, dark, more impulsive. Are they truly brothers?
   ``As far as we know,'' said Charlie Sheen in a joint interview.
``But anything can happen.''
   ``I've seen baby pictures of us together,'' said Estevez. ``We
lived in the same house.''
   Who beat up on whom during their Malibu childhoods?
   ``I think we beat each other up pretty equally,'' Estevez said.
``Mine was more of a mental torture on Charlie; I terrorized and
teased him just about all the way around the world (they traveled
to their father's locations). Physical confrontations were few but
memorable.''
   ``Of the Ali-Foreman caliber,'' Sheen said.
   Sheen checked into a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center for
a month on Aug. 9. His publicist, Jeff Barnard said he was
suffering from extreme exhaustion from filming two movies
back-to-back.
   In ``Men at Work'' the brothers play a couple of garbagemen who
find a body in the trash and become involved in a plot of murder
and environmental poisoning. Estevez traces the film's beginnings
to a sleepless night at his Santa Monica apartment in 1984. Hearing
the trash truck outside his window, he started devising a script.
   The project stagnated at a studio for a year until Estevez could
rescue the script. Fifteen drafts later, he made the deal with
Epic. The budget was definitely not in the ``Die Hard 2'' category.
   ``We made it for what is considered by the studios a low-budget
standard,'' Estevez said.
   How low? About half of the industry average of $18 to $20
million.
   Such a budget doesn't allow for Charlie Sheen's $1 million-plus
salary. He dodged the issue: ``I don't like to discuss cash, but
they were very generous.''
   Four years ago, Estevez wrote, directed and starred in
``Wisdom,'' becoming the youngest to perform all three functions in
a major film. It failed to find an audience.
   ``If I learned anything on the first picture, it was to really
open myself up, to include everybody in a community effort,'' he
said. ``If Charlie has an idea or if the crafts-service guy has an
idea, they both come from a place of wanting to make the movie
better. I didn't approach it that I was paranoid and they wanted to
take my movie away from me.''
   ``Oh, he'd listen to me _ if it was a good idea,'' added Sheen.
``I came up with some stinkers now and then, and they didn't make
the movie. They all can't be winners.''
   Did the brothers work well together?
   ``Absolutely,'' assured Estevez. ``You get there on the set and
there's 100 people. They all have a job to do, you have a job to
do.''
   ``You had three jobs to do,'' said Sheen.
   ``Right,'' said Estevez. ``There really wasn't time for any
shenanigans.''
   ``That doesn't mean we didn't have a good time making this
thing,'' his brother said.
   ``We had a lot of laughs. It's tough, though, making a film. My
days were running 18-19-hours. A director maybe gets four or five
hours' sleep.''
   About ``Navy SEALS,'' Sheen commented: ``A long shoot, 16 weeks,
eight in Virginia Beach, the remaining eight in Spain. Very
physical picture. Very dangerous picture. But a lot of time, I had
a great time playing that role. I got to create some situations as
opposed to just reacting to them.''
   He also appeared in ``Young Guns'' but missed the sequel.
   ``We left Charlie back at Blazer's Mill, where the historical
figure was killed. So he didn't follow us,'' Estevez said.
   ``I had no concern about doing this sequel. I felt the second
half of the Billy the Kid story had been left blank, and I wanted
to fill it in. It's a great character for an actor to play.
   ``Also, Charlie's got a pretty good body count in the films he's
done. I had to catch up. He's got 32, and now I'm up to 16 or 17
confirmed kills. So I'm working on it.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock 'n' roll, never a prime concern of the French
government, is getting a boost through France's new junior minister
of rock.
   ``Monsieur Rock,'' as he's been dubbed, is 27-year-old Bruno
Lion, a jean-clad dynamo with degrees in law and political science.
   His official title at the Culture Ministry is ``charge de
mission'' for rock and pop music, but he doesn't object when the
title is translated as junior minister. He was picked last year by
Culture Minister Jack Lang to revitalize a domain long dominated by
foreign talent or homegrown copycats.
   His appointment came at a time when French rock and pop were
beginning to outgrow their reputation as mediocre.
   Second-generation immigrants from post-colonial France _ a
patchwork of ethnic groups from Africa and the West Indies _ are
musically coming of age, venting their rage and fears in tough
sounds as diverse as their backgrounds.
   In recent years, Paris has emerged as a capital of ``world
music'' _ catchy, ethnic rhythms sung in French, Arabic, Spanish
and Caribbean dialects and updated with state-of-the art technology
by talented, innovative performers.
   Among the rising rockers are Mano Negra, who blends salsa,
hip-hop, gospel, punk and reggae; Les Negresses Vertes (the Green
Negresses), eight white men dressed in suits singing a blend of
exotic melodies, puns and Edith Piaf-style passion; and Les Garcons
Bouchers (the Apprentice Butchers), who wield meat cleavers and
spit wine.
   However, Lion's appointment met with ridicule and even outrage
from some critics who believe rock, by definition, ceases to be
rock once pulled into the mainstream.
   ``Any country that needs a minister for rock is not a rock
country,'' said Lionel Rotcage, editor of the French edition of
Rolling Stone. ``He should resign; that would be the `rock' thing
to do.''
   Lion, the son of a prominent businessman, has persevered,
chasing down financial and media support. With a 1990 budget of
$7.8 million, he expects to set up a solid support structure for
musicians and industry professionals, including direct subsidies to
artists.
   His tasks also involve promoting native talent at home and
abroad, no easy matter given France's dearth of concert space and
poor reputation as an inspiration for rock.
   ``France is underequipped compared to its neighbors. When I took
the job, we had as many concert halls as there are in greater
London or in Holland, and we're 12 times bigger,'' Lion said in an
interview.
   His priority is getting groups out of suburban basements, or
subway stations and onto the stages of concert halls and clubs.
Since he took office in May 1989, the government has helped finance
nearly 100 new auditoriums.
   Lion's appointment was hardly a disinterested cultural gesture.
   ``A little investment can go a long way,'' Lion said, noting
that the government yearly earns more than $180 million in taxes
from record sales.
   Lion sees himself as something of a talent scout. He said he
works 14-hour days, lobbying for formation of a major, all-French
record company, financing music videos and trying to get rock into
high schools. One of his goals is to internationally launch French
groups.
   At the recent New Music Seminar in New York, about 250 French
musicians performed, as opposed to only 10 in 1988 and 196 in 1989,
according to Lion. A follow-up measure includes the opening of a
French music office in New York next fall.
   Lion, however, is concerned about the new U.S. immigration
requirements for artists seeking temporary work permits. Lang and
other West European culture ministers have protested the measures,
which virtually exclude all but a handful of foreign performers who
can prove ``financial success and artistic worth.''
   ``The American laws discriminate against foreign artists,'' Lion
said. ``Look at Zouk Machine, No. 1 on Top 50 charts here for three
straight weeks. They are still waiting for their visa.''
   Lion said the European Economic Community may be forced to
retaliate to make its point. ``Looking ahead to 1993, we're talking
about a European export market of 340 million people,'' he said.
   Lion, who usually wears a black polo shirt, jeans and an
expensive leather jacket, was weaned on the Beatles and took up the
saxophone and bass, ``which I massacred,'' before turning to
management and production.
   In 1986, he set up the French Rock Council and published the
first definitive rock catalog for music professionals, which is
updated yearly.

<HEAD>New Private Television Offers Same Old Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICENTE L. PANETTA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight months after the government
raised hopes for better television by selling two channels, the
private tubes carry the same diet of game shows, tired comedy,
sensational news and reruns.
   ``They promised us cultural programs and they deceived us,''
said Raul Paladino, a high school math teacher. ``The news programs
aren't very informative ... and shows that are supposed to be funny
give me a headache.'' Dora Schmidt, a housewife, said both private
channels ``seem to have the same formula: soap operas, bloody
stories, conflicts between neighbors, assaults, rapes and all sorts
of low blows.''
   Carlos Montero, who has produced hit shows for three decades,
said the station staffs have ideas, but no money, and programming
might improve when the economy does.
   ``Television is like a dragon,'' he said. ``When it's healthy,
it breathes fire and converts everything to gold. When it's
asthmatic, in crisis, it begins to wheeze and turn everything to
ashes.''
   Channels 11 and 13 were sold in December, leaving only Channel 7
in government hands. The two other channels also are privately
owned.
   State-run television offers performances from around the world
of opera, ballet and classical music, and movies from Spain, the
United States, France and other countries.
   It carries top sports events, especially those with Argentine
competitors, and fewer, but not better, variety shows than the
private channels. Programs of news and commentary sometimes are
dull, but are not sensational.
   The two channels were the first state enterprises transferred to
private investors by President Carlos Menem's administration, which
is committed to divesting the telephone company, state airline,
railroads and virtually any other public entity that can be sold or
leased.
   Menem says privatization means new investment, technology,
enterprise, creativity and many other good things. What has
happened at the two TV channels indicates the rewards may be slow
in coming.
   Editorial Atlantida, Argentina's largest magazine publishing
company, bought Channel 11 for $8.2 million. Company President
Pedro Simoncini said the station had debts of $27 million and
obsolete equipment that must be replaced.
   Artear, owner of the mass-circulation newspaper Clarin, bought
Channel 13 for $5.6 million. Jose Demaria, the program director
said $8 million more must be spent on new equipment alone.
   Each channel has cut its staff to about 250 people, the
approximate level of the private station, Channel 9, that regularly
leads in ratings and profit.
   Executives at both of the new private channels say they are
losing money, and attribute most of the losses to a recession that
has cut advertising revenue, forcing stations to broadcast only
about 12 hours a day. Resources for new programs are scarce.
   The lineups on all private channels are about the same.
   Soccer matches are a mainstay, along with international sports
events involving Argentine stars _ Gabriela Sabatini in tennis, for
instance; boxer Martin Coggi, and Daniel Scioli in motorboat racing.
   Series imports from the United States are big. ``Miami Vice''
and ``Platoon'' placed in the top five recently.
   Locally produced variety shows feature arm wrestling, scantily
clad women, men wearing dresses and makeup, tango singers and
comedy skits with suggestive punch lines.
   In one popular show, women stand in a transparent booth and grab
money blown about by a fan that also lifts their skirts.
   News programs tend to be sensational: bloody crimes, political
scandals, fires, accidents, personal tragedies. Political satire
and interviews as likely to be dull as incisive.
   Satirist ``Tato'' Bores pretends to call President Menem on the
telephone and viewers hear a one-sided conversations. In the late
1960s, Bores made the same calls to Gen. Juan Carlos Ongania, who
was president at the time.
   Shows for children are ``short on ideas and repetitive,'' the
magazine Noticias said recently. U.S.-made cartoons are shown so
often that children know the endings in advance.
   Osvaldo Alvarez Guerrero, a national legislator with the
opposition Radical Civic Union, said simply: ``The level of
programing is pitiful.''

   When Vice President Dan Quayle was in
Lima the other day, you could exchange $3 for about a million
Peruvian intis, and inflation was getting worse.
   In Bogota, the new president of Colombia said in his inaugural
address that his nation's economy had been irreparably damaged by
the drop in coffee prices that followed U.S. withdrawal from an
international price agreement.
   Bolivian leaders weren't ready to complete the drug extradition
treaty the vice president hoped to see concluded. It will have to
wait, at least until the government completes a similar pact with
another country, perhaps Spain, to avoid the appearance of catering
to Washington.
   Those nations all are in the fight against drugs, but they have
their own problems, and sometimes their own priorities. In the
three capitals, Quayle talked about cooperation for economic
development and against drugs, with presidents who pledged support
to the drive against narcotics _ with varying degrees of dedication
_ while putting their emphasis on trade and assistance.
   That's the view of the U.S.-urged cocaine war from the Andean
nations looking north, along the route Quayle followed on a speedy,
Tuesday-to-Thursday mission last week.
   Colombia's newly inaugurated President Cesar Gaviria pledged to
continue the cocaine-combatting policy of his predecessor, but
pointedly reminded his inaugural audience that the Andean producing
nations can't choke off narcotics unless the industrial countries
where drugs are used curb the illegal appetite.
   In different words, that was repeated as Quayle conferred with
the leaders of Peru and Bolivia, where some suspect the United
States is trying to load the whole problem onto the producers
because it cannot control its users.
   Quayle said the United States is as determined to deal with its
own drug lords and users as with the producers, calling them
complementary efforts.
   But priorities don't necessarily mesh.
   Quayle's journey was a followup to the Feb. 15 drug summit at
Cartagena, Colombia, and at each stop he told of the
administration's plans for freer trade and expanded development
assistance for the Andean nations.
   But those pledges were general, without the specific measures
the three nations would like.
   In Peru, for example, where inflation has multiplied into
hyper-inflation and made the inti almost worthless, the new
president, Alberto Fujimori, met with Quayle on Wednesday hours
before instituting austerity measures, sharply increasing the cost
of basic commodities.
   His capital was in a state of emergency, braced for rioting and
the terrorist violence that has become commonplace. ``I told him
very clearly that the United States stands ready to help him with
those challenges,'' Quayle said. ``This is a time of opportunity
for Peru, though a time of great troubles.''
   But he didn't say how the United States would help, beyond the
$160 million in economic and military aid proposed for the next
year, much of it tied to the campaign against the coca, the raw
material for cocaine _ and a major source of dollars in the
stricken Peruvian economy.
   There is $36.5 million in military assistance stalled in the
pipeline, awaiting a Peruvian plan for action against cocaine
growers and traffickers. Quayle and Fujimori discussed it, with no
conclusion announced.
   ``I do believe it is in his interest to accept the aid
package,'' Quayle said.
   Appraising the Andean strategy against cocaine, the
administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy said
Peruvians are more concerned about their economic crisis and the
struggle with revolutionary guerrillas than about narcotics.
   Common sense says the same thing.
   Fallen coffee prices have cost the Colombian economy more than
$500 million in export earnings in the year since the international
coffee agreement came apart, after U.S. withdrawal, in part because
eastern bloc nations were getting their coffee at cut rates.
   Coffee is the major legal export; lowered prices can only make
illegal cocaine a more enticing business.
   Quayle said in Bogota that the United States isn't opposed to
reinstating the price pact, but ``Brazil has been the holdout.'' He
said coffee prices are going up anyway, benefiting producers.
   Colombian traders also want lower U.S. tariffs on cut flowers,
another major export. They got one specific from the vice
president; Quayle interceded to speed negotiation of a new trade
agreement, with talks to begin by the first week in September.
   But Quayle did not get approval for an extradition treaty to
send Bolivian narcotics suspects under U.S. indictment to the
United States for trial. Extradition has been one of Colombia's
major steps against the drug cartel. Quayle said he hoped there
would be a Bolivian treaty soon, and is confident the Colombian
extraditions will continue under the new president.
   Quayle called for partnership and cooperation.
   The administration's drug policy office supplied a tougher
message, saying that continued U.S. aid hinges on effective action
against narcotics. The drug office said the anti-cocaine efforts of
the Andean nations are being monitored and evaluated now, to see
whether they justify aid next year.

<HEAD>TNT's ``Heat Wave'' Relives Watts Riots of 1965</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early in ``Heat Wave,'' a black teen-ager fresh
in from the segregated Alabama of 1960 stands on a hill overlooking
Los Angeles. His memories: ``It was California. The color-blind
dream.''
   Five years later, the youngster, Bob Richardson, is a Los
Angeles Times messenger, reluctantly made the Times' first black
journalist to report on the city's bloody Watts riots after white
reporters were attacked there.
   Premiering tonight on Ted Turner's TNT cable network, ``Heat
Wave'' is partly based on what scriptwriter Michael Lazlou says was
Richardson's true story, sporadically told from Richardson's point
of view in voice-overs.
   But it's basically a mosaic of life back then in that black
community, one that dramatizes events leading up to the riots and
the deadly nights of rage, looting and burning that erupted there
25 years ago this month.
   It has a number of pluses, including a superb cast. The players
include Blair Underwood as Richardson; James Earl Jones as the
owner of a Watts shoe-repair business, a man who urges patience;
and Cicely Tyson as Richardson's grandmother, who works as a maid
for a Beverly Hills family.
   You've got to give ``Heat Wave'' an A for its effort to portray
the racial discrimination, the lack of all but menial jobs for
blacks, the police harassment of blacks, the anger and frustration
that brews up and explodes on one sweltering summer night.
   It also has a few well-shaded illustrations of the complexity of
the Watts riots, particularly its version of a highway patrolman's
arrest of a black teen-ager for suspected drunken driving, an
arrest that sparked the riot.
   The white patrolman is anything but abusive. The youth's mother
shows up and slaps her son for drinking. But when the patrolman,
almost apologetically says he has to arrest the teen-ager, the kid
gets violent.
   More cops are called, they bust heads, they get hit back, the
riot is on, and in due course fearful whites in distant
neighborhoods arm themselves _including the man for whom Tyson's
character works.
   But the movie is an uneven effort, partly because of Lazlou's
propensity for clunky dialogue, particularly in the crucial
newsroom scenes, which use real names of two staffers, the Times'
then-city editor, Bill Thomas, and reporter Art Berman.
   When white reporters are beaten and chased from Watts by angry
blacks and the paper is faced with the prospect of only police
handouts to rely on, the editor, played by David Strathairn, says,
``Damnit, I need a Negro reporter.''
   Reluctantly agreeing to Richardson's pleas to let him report
from Watts, where Richardson lives, he subsequently gets an
eyewitness account that the rookie purportedly has dictated from
the scene his first time out.
   ``Pretty good, huh?'' asks Berman (Adam Arkin).
   ``Better than good,'' says the editor, who promply emits Cliche
101 used in most TV depictions of newspaper life. ``Run it. As is.''
   It goes on the front page, with Richardson's byline _ and an
editor's note that says Richardson, ``a Negro, is an advertising
messenger for The Times.''
   Although filled with self-doubt when the father of his best
friend calls him an ``Uncle Tom bastard'' and his best friend also
berates him for his report, the wise, knowing businessman Jones
plays urges Richardson to continue.
   ``Look into your heart and tell the truth,'' the older man says.
``Not the white man's truth. Not the black man's truth. There's
only one truth.''
   Noble sentiments. Unfortunately, he is so noble, you may suspect
he is doomed. Likewise a decent young white cop (Harold Pruett) who
befriends Richardson.
   It's a little maddening, this telegraphing of punches, as is
director Kevin Hooks' terrible staging of a scene in which one
epitome of decency is shot down by California National Guardsmen.
   That scene just doesn't ring true, a pity since Hooks' direction
elsewhere is usually effective.
   Summation: ``Heat Wave'' is a good attempt that tries hard. But
given the excellence of the cast, it could and should have been far
better.

   PRIMARIES FORCE NEW NIGHT FOR DOCUDRAMA: CBS says its made-for
TV movie about last year's much-publicized Stuart murder case in
Boston has been rescheduled to Sept. 25. The show's previous Sept.
18 air date, CBS apparently discovered a bit late, would have
conflicted with the Massachusetts gubernational and senatorial
primaries. CBS commissioned the movie less than a week after
Charles Stuart, implicated in the shooting murder of his pregnant
wife, leaped to his death from a Boston bridge. The film's unwieldy
title: ``Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston.''

<HEAD>Americans Have Options in Oil Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two very American responses to a potential oil
shortage have emerged from the Iraqi threat. One is to have
``somebody do something'' about it, and the other is to do
something about it oneself.
   In the first instance, elected officials are urged to take
action against alleged price exploiters through the courts or
legislative bodies, the notion being that sellers should be forced
to serve consumers.
   The process hasn't worked well in the past. If there are no
profits to be made, oil shippers, wholesalers, refiners,
distributors and sellers won't remain in business. The flow will
slow and the pump lines will grow.
   In the other instance, people examine their own situation and
decide what action they can take. They recognize that while high
prices or a shortage will hurt them, they can lessen the damage by
conserving.
   Conservation worked in the past, in the 1970s, and the American
economy and all those who contribute to it are better off. It
raised the quality of homes and automobiles, not to mention the
effect on the quality of the air we breathe.
   It worked well for a decade. More efficient and cleaner
combustion engines were developed, doubling the miles per gallon of
automobiles. More effective insulation materials were developed,
making homes snug with less fuel used.
   The development of solar power, cleanest of all, was
accelerated. Idle water power was put to use. Heat from machinery
and electricity was reused rather than vented.
   Progress was made in the safe use of nuclear power, and while
environmental fears thwarted full usage and eventually stalled the
program, the advances that were made might be relied on again some
day.
   Lives as well as gasoline were saved when the national speed
limit was reduced to 55 miles an hour. In spite of higher prices,
some people even reduced their bills by agreeing to car pool their
way to work each day.
   Americans all but abandoned much of the conservation effort
during the 1980s. Young, innovative solar power companies went out
of business. Utilities abandoned nuclear power plans. The speed
limit and thermostats went up.
   But the effort has shown that individuals could find value in
what appeared to be a total negative, and some of those options are
still available.
   Many people can drive less, and more slowly and efficiently.
Some can join car pools. Most can turn down thermostats and be
healthier for it. They can avoid paying prices that are out of line
with those of other sellers.
   In a business sense, alternative energy sources still represent
a private-sector investment opportunity. For the government, the
latest crisis could provide an opportunity for measures reducing
U.S. dependency on imports.
   Experience shows that any economic crisis an have important and
lasting benefits for individuals, companies and governments.
Recessions create conditions for expansions, for example, and fuel
shortages lead to fuel-saving.
   It suggests that initiative in the face of crisis might be more
effective than complaining to elected officials, some of whom might
be more interested than the oil refiners and retailers in
exploiting the situation.

<HEAD>James Stewart's Favorite Pooka</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, and I'm happy,
Doctor. I finally won out over it.'' _ Elwood P. Dowd.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Stewart was talking the other day about
one of his favorite co-stars, a 6-foot pooka named Harvey.
   What's a pooka? It's an oversized rabbit, considered fictional
by most folks, but very much real to Elwood P. Dowd in the 1950
movie ``Harvey.'' The Universal Pictures comedy has been released
for home video, along with a six-minute introduction by Stewart
himself.
   ``Coming back in video _ I kind of like the idea,'' he remarked
in an interview at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ``People can see the
whole picture with no interruptions for anything.
   ``It seems that in the mail I've gotten for the past 10 years,
almost everybody speaks of `Harvey.' It's one of their favorite
pictures.''
   With Henry Koster as director, the movie is all about Elwood,
who is in his early 40s and shares a house with his older sister,
Veta, and niece, Myrtle Mae. He is the most considerate of men,
forever holding doors open and offering invitations for dinner, a
penchant for martinis his only vice.
   Why is he so happy? According to Elwood, he was walking down the
street one evening when he encountered a large, white rabbit
leaning against a lamppost and the two became instant soulmates.
Elwood has no job _ a large inheritance took care of that _ and no
sweetheart, but always has a wonderful time thanks to the towering
and invisible presence of his dear friend, Harvey.
   ``Harvey and I have things to do,'' Elwood says. ``We sit in the
bars ... have a drink or two ... play the juke box. Very soon the
faces of the other people turn towards me and they smile. They say:
`We don't know your name, mister, but you're all right. All right.'
Harvey and I warm ourselves in these golden moments.''
   Stewart traced his history with ``Harvey,'' Mary Chase's
Pulitzer Prize-winning play with the gentle message of who's sane
and who's not.
   ``I got into it after the war, quite by accident. I went to New
York to see the play; Frank Fay had been playing Elwood P. Dowd for
quite a while.
   ``During the intermission, the producer, Brock Pemberton, came
up and asked what I thought of the play. I said, `I just think it's
the most wonderful thing I've seen in my life.' He said, `How'd you
like to play it?' I thought he was kidding, but I said, `I'd love
to.' In three weeks I was playing it.''
   After three years in the play, Fay wanted a vacation, and
Stewart was delighted to substitute. Pemberton invited all the
drama critics to cover the new Dowd. The result: ``I've never
gotten such bad reviews.''
   Stewart returned for another Fay vacation the following year.
Again the critics were invited. ``The reviews were even worse than
what I got before,'' he said.
   Undeterred, Stewart continued playing the role, and years later,
when he was a better fit for the age of Elwood P. Dowd, he revived
it in New York and London, with Helen Hayes as Dowd's dismayed
sister.
   Stewart discovered a regular pattern at the Saturday matinees.
Parents would bring their young children, and inevitably in the
first act one of them would call out, ``Where's the rabbit?''
   ``That was always the biggest laugh in the play,'' he said.
   Chase declared Stewart her favorite to star in the movie version
of ``Harvey,'' and a deal was struck. However, the actor had a
certain reluctance.
   ``I wasn't sure about the movie. To me the whole idea is that
you have to convince the audience that there is a rabbit up there
with you, and you're talking to him. With the movie you have no
audience; you have a camera, you have electricians, you have
another set next to you. So it seemed different, and I didn't know
if it would work. But the thing is strong enough so it did work,''
the actor said.
   Elwood is among Stewart's most popular roles.
   ``In this world you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant,''
Elwood says of his unflappable geniality, and that sums up the
sweet comedy. Even Stewart has said his portrayal was too nice. He
brought out more haunting aspects of Elwood in later appearances,
including a 1972 television production.
   Jimmy Stewart at 82 no longer makes movies, but he remains busy,
flying around the country to receive honors, appear for worthy
causes and to talk about his book, ``Jimmy Stewart's Poems.'' The
slender volume, containing a total of four poems, has sold 350,000
hardcover copies. The paperback, due later this year, is expected
to zoom over 1 million, and Stewart has now recorded an audio
version.
   ``Johnny Carson had a lot to do with it,'' he said. ``I recited
the poems on his show, and I had some encouragement from
(screenwriter) Leonard Gershe. He talked to some people in New
York. They said, `You just have four of them?'
   ``I love the idea when people say, `When's your new book of
poems coming out?' It took me 20 years to write these four poems.
When I write another book, I'll be 102 years old. So I think I'm
going to leave the thing. This'll be my book of poetry.''

<TEXT>
   ``I was always terrible at remembering lyrics and so I'd just
shout `hi-de-ho' in place of some words. When I saw how people
reacted, I just kept `hi-de-ho-ing.''' _ Cab Calloway.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Don't bring up all that legend stuff with Cab
Calloway.
   He's not in the mood.
   Yeah. He's been around. How many years now? Well, just say 60 if
you need a number. But that's not important.
   What's important is the music. It's what keeps the 82-year-old
``hi-de-ho'' king on the road and away from his home in White
Plains, N.Y., much of the year.
   It doesn't matter what town he's in anymore. Just find a spot
and a band and he'll be there. He was in Europe in the spring. He's
been all over the United States this summer.
   ``It doesn't mean anything to me, it's just part of the
routine,'' Calloway said when asked if he was looking forward to
two recent performances at the Hollywood Bowl. ``If I wasn't here,
I'd just be someplace else this weekend.''
   Sound harsh? Perhaps, but after all the guy is a legend, even if
it bugs him to admit it. One could tell by the awe-struck looks on
the faces of the musicians when he glided out on stage during
rehearsal, just like one of those old black-and-white film clips
from the 1930s.
   One could see it again when he sang ``Minnie the Moocher,'' when
he held that last note on ``St. James Infirmary'' longer than a
human being ought to be allowed to, when he swayed and strutted
around stage like some nimble tightrope walker.
   Those moves have slowed a bit since the '30s, a time when
Calloway could have danced Michael Jackson or Mick Jagger into the
ground. And maybe the hair is white and thinner now, the
mid-section thicker and that classically handsome face lined and
puffy after eight decades of full-throttle living. But every bit of
his voice is still there _ and every bit of the style and grace
that made the legend.
   So ask him who some of his own musical legends are.
   ``Nobody,'' he answers tartly.
   No, really.
   ``I don't know _ it's been too long,'' he finally offers. As he
does, he peers off into space as if to recall those wonderful days
when jazz was king _ those days of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington,
Dizzy Gillespie, Lena Horne and others. He worked with them all.
   ``No, I'll tell you who my heroes are,'' he finally says,
wheeling around to face his interviewer. ``My heroes are the notes,
man. The music itself. You understand what I'm saying? I love the
music. The music is my hero.''
   Indeed, Calloway, who was born Cabell Calloway on Christmas Day
in Rochester, N.Y., gave up a law career for music. His old Lincoln
University classmate, Thurgood Marshall, stayed in school and made
quite a name for himself on the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``Yeah,'' Calloway says, smiling at the memory. ``I went to high
school with him, too. He's a good old guy.
   ``I was studying law and I got involved in music, so I put the
law career down for music.''
   Any regrets?
   ``Nah. But it wouldn't matter much now, would it?''
   The music started in earnest sometime in the '20s, when he
became a part-time singer in Baltimore, and joined an all-male
quartet in the revue ``Plantation Days.''
   ``Really, I don't remember,'' Calloway laughs when pressed for
more specifics. ``I don't want to remember. It's been too many
years to want to remember.''
   But it was in 1930, he concedes, that he hooked up with another
legend, Harlem's Cotton Club.
   ``They wanted a band up there to follow Duke Ellington and they
picked me,'' he said.
   He took the fabled old nightclub by storm. Soon there were not
only concerts but hit movies such as ``Stormy Weather'' and
``International House,'' and a string of Broadway shows. He also
found time to get married and have children. His daughter, Chris,
is a singer who has performed with her father in recent years.
   And always there was the music: one big-band aggregation of
brilliant musicians after another, each led by the dressed-to-kill
dandy, the wild, leaping, gyrating band leader with the
unbelievable voice. They cranked out such hits as ``The Jumpin'
Jive,'' ``Reefer Man,'' ``It Ain't Necessarily So.'' They created
musical styles that everybody else copied.
   They first did ``Minnie the Moocher'' in 1931. More than a
half-century later, people sing it all over the place. Even those
who don't know they know it sing the chorus:
``Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho.''
   ``I needed a theme song and I knew `Minnie' would be a good
one,'' Calloway says of the tune he wrote about the ``lowdown
hootchie kootcher'' with the heart as big as a whale. ``It really
doesn't mean anything.''
   But it made him the king of ``hi-de-ho'' and brought him success
that didn't slow until the '50s. Even after that there were more
movies and plays, but rock and other musical forms crowded aside
the big bands.
   Then The Blues Brothers came along. Comedians Dan Aykroyd and
John Belushi took to the stage as cheap-suited, sullen-looking,
ersatz rhythm and blues singers, mimicking the music they loved.
When they put their act on the big screen as ``The Blues Brothers''
movie in 1980, Calloway went with them. He sang ``Minnie the
Moocher'' and stole the show.
   ``I think a lot of the young people knew me,'' he says now.
``They just didn't recognize me until `The Blues Brothers' movie.''
   Now that they recognize him once again, he's in no mood to slow
down. He'll perform for the public, he says, ``Whenever they want
me.''

<HEAD>Haiti's `Little Priest' Defrocked, but Not Silenced</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Ragged, barefoot boys stop playing
marbles and run to the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide when the priest
arrives at his white, two-story wooden home for street children.
   They shout ``Pe Titid!'' _ Little Priest, a Creole nickname for
Aristide.
   He is thin, about 5 feet 4 inches tall and appears almost
fragile, but many people believe the man behind those gold-rimmed
spectacles is one of the most powerful in Haiti.
   Aristide's strength is rooted in his ability to inflame the
downtrodden masses who are the majority in this violent,
impoverished Caribbean nation of 6 million.
   Many followers believe the 35-year-old Roman Catholic priest is
a prophet. He has demonstrated the ability to stir the slums with
fiery oratory and fill the streets with protesters.
   He opposes the elections scheduled for Nov. 4 and speaks of a
revolution by ``active nonviolence.'' Aristide advocates liberation
theology, which would involve the church in a political struggle
for social justice.
   In an interview, he said: ``The people will know when to come
out. Protests are a weapon, but like all weapons, you have to know
when to fire.''
   The Salesian Order expelled him in December 1988 as a
``protagonist of destabilization.'' Aristide remains a priest, but
is not allowed to conduct services or deliver sermons on the church
radio.
   ``I continue to proclaim the same truth without Mass,'' he said.
``The most important thing for me is to serve people.''
   Aristide said he opposes the elections because Haiti has too
many violent holdovers from the Duvalier family dictatorship, which
ruled for three decades until a popular uprising drove Jean-Claude
Duvalier into exile in February 1986.
   Haiti has had five governments in the violent years since.
   ``We are in a struggle,'' Aristide said. ``It's a real war.
People with money and guns are killing people without money and
guns. We have to have justice first, then elections. Today, those
with weapons will win elections.''
   In Aristide's view, free and fair elections are not possible
until the people behind major violence in Haiti are caught and
imprisoned.
   His main interest is in those responsible for the 1987 election
massacre, when thugs backed by the army killed 34 people; an
assault on his church while he was saying Mass by gunmen who killed
13 parishioners, wounded 70 and burned the building, and the attack
June 28 on the Council of State during a meeting. A council member
and a union activist were killed.
   The priest calls attention to the recent return from exile of
Roger Lafontant and Williams Regala, a retired army colonel, both
associated with the Duvalier regime.
   Lafontant was a leader of the Tonton Macoutes, the brutal
personal militia of the Duvaliers. Regala, former minister of
interior and defense, has been accused of coordinating the
election-day attack in November 1987.
   Aristide criticizes the United States for insisting on
elections, to which it has tied the resumption of aid. Washington
canceled $70 million in assistance after the November 1987 massacre.
   Violence also is likely on the forthcoming election day,
Aristide said, and he does not think the presence of international
observers will stop it.
   ``If the American government sends observers, they too will be
criminals because, after they leave, the killing will continue,''
he said. ``Why not help us get justice first?''
   Jean-Claude Roy, a leader in a coalition of 12 political
parties, said the priest ``has a lot of weight and followers. He is
certainly somebody to have on your side. He is a man who lives with
the suffering of the people and is moved and touched by it.''
   Georges Fauriol, a Caribbean specialist with the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said of
Aristide: ``If he can mobilize people, it is a worrisome prospect
for elections.''
   Aristide spent months in hiding after his expulsion from the
Salesians. Now, he keeps a nonstop schedule.
   He drives to peasant meetings in the countryside with an
entourage of followers. In Port-au-Prince, he runs the home and
farm for 140 homeless boys and meets with politicians and labor
leaders.
   During an interview in a classroom of the boys' home, called
Lafami Celavi, his eyes flashed with anger as he told stories of
military persecution of the peasants.
   Little boys peered up a wooden staircase and giggled when they
sew him talking to a stranger.
   ``Put on a clean shirt! Go! Go!'' Aristide admonished one of the
scruffy youngsters.
   He scoffs at rumors of presidential ambitions.
   ``I would be a traitor to my people if I wanted power,'' he
said. ``Everybody who wants to be president is sick. They have
presidentitis.''
   Aristide has escaped at least three attempts on his life. The
last was the raid on his church in September 1988 while he was
saying Mass.
   He sleeps at different places, as a precaution, and said threats
would not deter him.
   ``I am not afraid for my life,'' he said. ``I am a Haitian
first, a Christian second and I can't be happy with my people
unhappy.''

   Carlos Lucero was given up for ``very dead'' in
his race for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. But he's
alive again, testimony to the resurrection potential of the savings
and loan debacle.
   Lucero, 49, an Alamosa attorney, has shrunk front-runner Josie
Heath's lead to a few percentage points with a relentless S&amp;L
assault that even includes his own band of investigators, the
Untouchables.
   Heath, 52, a former Boulder County commissioner, has responded
with a series of calls for the government to seize the assets of
``S&amp;L villains'' to pay for what she calls an outrageous rip-off.
   ``We're going to ask working men and women to bail out a decade
of the politics of privilege and greed. I'm unwilling to do that,''
she said recently. ``People are angry and they feel victimized.
They're hopping mad. Everybody's talking about it.''
   The two face off in Tuesday's primary. But polls show that
whoever wins will have a formidable job catching up with five-term
U.S. Rep. Hank Brown, running unopposed on the GOP side. Sen. Bill
Armstrong, R-Colo., is retiring.
   Brown, a personable man with a seat on the powerful tax-writing
Ways and Means Committee, is a diehard opponent of new taxes and
has a relatively moderate record on issues such as abortion and the
environment.
   He is already benefiting from White House support in the form of
high-profile campaign visits from people like U.S. trade
representative Carla Hills and drug-war chief William Bennett.
   But Brown's ace in the hole is money.
   As of June 30, the Federal Election Commission said Brown had
raised just under $3 million; Heath had drawn $411,000; and Lucero
brought in $182,500. The candidates' cash on hand was even more
telling: $1.39 million for Brown, $84,000 for Heath and $10,000 for
Lucero.
   In a gesture he could well afford, Brown recently turned over
$9,000 to the federal agency in charge of cleaning up the thrift
mess _ all the money he's ever received from S&amp;L interests.
   Lucero contends Brown ``has accomplished next to nothing'' in
Congress and is the favorite solely because he has raised so much
money.
   ``They checked his pockets, and they jingle when he walks,'' he
said. ``And that, according to the smart money, leaves me on the
outside looking in... very poor, very dead.''
   Lucero has astounded observers by remaining a viable candidate.
But Heath has also been a surprising performer, showing so much
strength early on that former party chairman Buie Seawell was
forced out of the contest.
   If she wins the nomination, she'll be the fourth Colorado woman
to run for Senate on a major party ticket since 1980.
   The portents are not good. Republicans Mary Estill Buchanan and
Martha Ezzard lost in 1980 and 1986, while Democrat Nancy Dick lost
in 1984 after edging Lucero in the primary.
   But Heath, whose only political experience has been as a county
commissioner, is undaunted. She's attracting national attention and
support from women's groups with a pro-choice abortion stance and
an issue-oriented campaign.
   She has proposed cutting the defense budget by half over 10
years and converting Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant to a toxic
waste research facility. She has also called for some form of
national health care.
   In a new television ad, Heath says political experts told her
all three ideas were risky. ``Well to me, winning isn't worth it
unless you can do what's right when you get there,'' the candidate
says.
   Lucero has lately depended almost exclusively on the S&amp;L crisis,
particularly Denver's failed Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan,
to stoke voter indignation:
   _He has said Colorado U.S. Attorney Mike Norton should remove
himself from the Silverado investigation because Norton received a
$2,000 contribution for an unsuccessful congressional race from a
Silverado figure.
   _He has called for a lifetime ban of Neil Bush from the banking
industry because of Bush's actions as a Silverado director.
   _His ``Untouchables'' team discovered myriad trust funds set up
by Ken Good, a former Denver real estate investor who declared
bankruptcy and defaulted on $32 million in Silverado loans.
   Lucero's summer S&amp;L offensive has attracted attention so far but
not money. In the first 25 days of July, he reportedly raised about
$11,000 _ a fifth of the Heath take and less than a tenth of what
Brown raised in the same period.

<HEAD>Most Weapons Makers Still Shunned Despite Middle East Menace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prolonged military conflict in the Middle East
will boost business for some U.S. arms manufacturers but the
defense industry probably still faces further retrenchment.
   Despite the deployment of American air, sea and ground forces in
the Persian Gulf region, investment strategists who follow defense
contractors mostly remain bearish.
   Paul H. Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., however,
says the unfolding crisis could subtly alter the attitude in
Washington toward defense spending.
   ``We feel that the chopping of the defense budget _ rather
mindlessly as we would view it by the Congress _ has probably been
brought to an end,'' he says. ``There will be more concern about
what they are chopping and less inclination to just hack away.''
   Proponents of maintaining American military might immediately
seized on the Iraqi threat as an argument against gutting the
Pentagon budget.
   Iraq President Saddam Hussein has been portrayed as the new
villian. He has become a replacement for the Soviet Union, which
under the Bush administration has been regarded as a kindler,
gentler superpower, little like the menacing foe of the Cold War
era.
   On the same day news broke that Iraq had invaded its Persian
Gulf neighbor, the Senate voted to leave intact President Bush's
1991 budget request for the B-2 bomber.
   In advocating preservation of funding for the stealth aircraft,
Republican leader Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas called Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait a ``wake-up call'' against deep cuts in military spending.
   Such rhetoric will grow louder if the Mideast turmoil
intensifies. Already, the situation has provided enough ammunition
to make the job of defeating proposed defense cuts much easier.
   The Wall Street selloff triggered by Iraq flexing its military
muscle didn't deal as harsh a blow to defense stocks as it did to
other sectors. Defense stocks outperformed the overall market by 10
percent to 15 percent, analysts estimate.
   Prudential-Bache upgraded its investment opinion of the 14
stocks included in its defense group. The group's rating was raised
to a buy from a hold, although ratings on individual companies
didn't change, Nisbet said.
   Some of the stocks within the group that Pru-Bache has selected
as buys are Boeing Co., Martin Marietta Corp., McDonnell Douglas
Corp., Northrop Corp. and Raytheon Co.
   General Dynamics Corp., which recently announced plans to trim
2,000 jobs by the end of the year in consolidating two of its
missile-making operations, is rated as a hold by Pru-Bache.
   Nisbet believes General Dynamics would be a crucial stock to own
in a time of war or prolonged conflict.
   ``It represents a one-stop shopping center for weapons,'' and
supplies everything from tanks and nuclear submarines to fighter
aircraft for the Navy and radio backpacks for the Army, he says.
   General Dynamics also is one of the cheapest defense stocks
around _ selling at only four times next year's projected earnings,
according to Nisbet.
   Steven Binder of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. says the Mideast situation
and subsequent oil price spiral will temporarily improve the
relative performance of defense stocks.
   An inflation flareup benefits arms manufacturers. Contracts
typically include escalation clauses allowing higher costs to be
recovered.
   A few companies, Binder says, could experience particular
benefits over a longer time period. Raytheon, which makes the
patriot missile, should find additional eager customers in Israel
and Saudi Arabia.
   Phil Friedman, first vice president for research at PaineWebber
Group Inc., says Iraq's actions have helped speed an evolution in
thinking about the types of weaponry that should be emphasized in
planning defense outlays.
   Conventional arms that capitalize on fast response and lift
capability _ the ability to move troops and equipment into remote
areas _ have gained favor over the fancy strategic stuff in fashion
until the big thaw in superpower relations.
   But Friedman doesn't foresee any windfall for the defense
industry.
   ``We don't think that you're going to see any material budget
changes due to the Middle East developments,'' he says.

<HEAD>Many `New Low' Stocks Don't Mean Buying Opportunity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How low have things been on Wall Street lately?
Well, more New York Stock Exchange issues reached ``new lows'' this
week than in any time since the Black Monday crash of 1987.
   Last Monday, 370 Big Board stocks close at their lowest levels
of the past 52 weeks in consolidated trading, hurt by the economic
uncertainty surrounding the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. By comparison,
1,068 issues closed at new lows on Black Monday, and 1,173 stocks
did so the following day.
   To put it another way, roughly one out of every six Big Board
stocks touched on a new low last week.
   ``That's a wound,'' said William Raftery, an analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. Discounting 1987, he said, last week's
showing was the worst since the summer of 1981, the start of a bear
market.
   Analysts are particularly concerned with the divergence between
the Dow Jones industrial average _ which tracks the stocks of 30 of
America's largest corporations _ and the broader market, or
everything else.
   As the Dow average flirted with the 3,000 level last month, the
broader market was losing ground. That move was exacerbated this
past week after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sparked fears that oil
supplies would be jeopardized and the U.S. economy badly hurt.
   ``As long as most stocks hold to their trading range, you could
argue that the market was working out'' of a slump, Raftery said.
``But once you start seeing so many stocks hitting new lows,
they're probably going down for some good, economic fundamental
reasons.''
   Which is precisely why many experts say now is not the time to
buy. Many doubt the market has hit bottom and a number of major
brokerages this past week recommended clients limit their stock
exposure and shift more assets into cash.
   ``When you're at a bottom, you see the broad market start to
churn a little bit ... start to lift a little,'' said Alfred E.
Goldman, a vice president at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons
Inc. This hasn't yet happened.
   According to a recent Smith Barney forecast, there is a 20
percent chance stocks are in a bear market right now, up from just
a 10 percent chance a few weeks ago.
   Events in the Middle East aside, plenty of problems still plague
the market. ``Nothing's changed,'' Raftery said. ``The economy's
still weak, the inflation rate is still questionable _ there's
nothing to cheer about.''
   Indeed, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report issued last week irked
Bush administration officials by predicting that even without
higher energy costs, the economy is grinding to a standstill and
will slip into a recession this fall.
   What would have been a positive report on July wholesale prices
_ which declined 0.1 percent rather than post increase as the
market expected _ was dismissed by the govenment's own caveat that
the recent spike in oil prices would show up in the next assessment.
   ``The bulk economic evidence points to a much more sluggish
economy than anybody anticipated, and hopes for soft landing have
been thrown out window due to the Middle East crisis,'' Goldman
said.
   With economic fundamentals such as they are, corporate profits
are likely to be pressured for some time, and that will further
weigh on the stock market.
   At the close on Friday Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips
stood at 2,716.58, down 93.07 points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.67 to 184.15;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
9.43 to 408.03 and the American Stock Exchange market value index
stood at 339.32, off 7.31.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 181.29 million shares a day,
down from 208.51 million the week before.

<HEAD>Why Is a Man Named Saddam Hussein Taking Money Out of Your Wallet?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are quickly learning that a remote
country called Iraq and its dictator Saddam Hussein are making them
pay more to fill up the car, buy a plane ticket, turn on the air
conditioner or borrow money.
   The gravity of the U.S. confrontation with Iraq increased this
past week, economically as well as militarily.
   Oil prices jumped at the prospect of disrupted supplies from the
Persian Gulf. Stocks and bonds weakened, and business strategists
scrambled to re-spin their forecasts for an already weak economy.
   The crisis resurrected memories of the 1970s Arab oil embargo,
reminded the country of its addiction to foreign energy and
refocused attention on efforts to conserve and live modestly.
   But for millions of ordinary consumers who watched fuel prices
rise at an alarming rate within days, the linkage with Iraq was
unclear at best and smacked of price gouging at worst. Many
motorists, cynical from previous oil shortages that produced record
industry profits, believed the crisis was fabricated.
   Here, in question-and-answer form, are some of the most
fundamental economic questions arising from the Middle East
situation:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Why have crude oil prices risen so quickly, even when there's</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   plenty of supply still around?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's occupation of neighboring Kuwait and threat to Saudi
Arabia provoked a U.S.-led boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait. The
possibility of a prolonged shutoff of oil from those two countries,
combined with the potential disruptions of shipments from the
Persian Gulf region, raised the specter of quickly depleted oil
stockpiles around the world _ especially in the United States,
which imports 50 percent of its daily consumption of 8.4 million
barrels. This forced a rush of buyers into the oil markets, hiking
the price from $21 a barrel to more than $28 at midweek before
settling back to the $26.50 range.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Why would that have such an immediate impact on the prices of</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   refined products like gasoline, since they were produced from oil
that was purchased relatively cheaply?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Oil refiners contend they must pay the prevailing price at the
time crude oil reaches them, regardless of the price when it was
pumped from the well. Therefore, they must reflect the increase in
their costs immediately. Moreover, many oil companies say, pressure
for rising gasoline prices has been building for months, partly
because of increased summer demand. Even so, the oil industry has
shown some sensitivity to consumer anger over rising prices and
several companies have frozen or rolled back gasoline prices
slightly.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Are higher oil prices forcing up the other costs of everyday</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   life?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   They could, if prices stay high for a prolonged period. Items
ranging from electric bills to frozen broccoli to steel-belted
radials could cost more. Transportation companies, for example,
will exact surcharges to ship produce from farms to cities. Oil is
also a key component of automobile tires, plastics and fertilizer.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>What is the potential impact on the economy in general?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   By all accounts, inflation will accelerate and erode consumer
purchasing power at a time when few people can afford it. Many
forecasters say the economy has already dipped dangerously near
recession, which ordinarily would mean the Federal Reserve would
ease interest rates to stimulate economic growth. But higher
inflation could keep the Fed from lowering rates and might even
push rates higher. Already, the cost of borrowed money has gone up,
making loans such as home mortgages more expensive.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Does this mean it's wise to buy a fuel-efficient car?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Probably yes, and that is bad news for the nation's automakers,
which have leaned more toward selling gas-guzzlers in recent years
because gasoline has been plentiful and relatively cheap. Although
most U.S. cars burn much less gas than they did in the 1970s,
Japanese models generally are more fuel-efficient, increasing
prospects that their share of the U.S. market could grow and
further weaken the Big Three's business.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>What other U.S. companies could be badly hurt?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Airlines are especially feeling pinched by rising oil prices and
many have increased ticket prices by as much as 10 percent. Fuel is
one of the airlines' biggest and most unpredictable expenses. But
airline analysts say passing the costs along to consumers is a
risky move, because many potential passengers could simply choose
not to fly. That will reduce airline revenue at a time when many
already are hurting. Some analysts say the Middle East crisis
eventually could put some money-losers such as Eastern, TWA and Pan
Am out of business.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Wouldn't conservation lessen reliance on foreign energy?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Yes, but that will take a long time. An enormous rise in the
number of vehicles on U.S. highways has largely outrun advances in
fuel efficiency, which means the United States needs more imported
oil than ever. Energy experts say alternative fuels such as
corn-derived ethanol fuel, natural gas, solar and nuclear power
would ease this dependence. But others predict that earnest
conservation wouldn't begin unless shortages appear and prices
double or triple.
