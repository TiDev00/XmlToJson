   Lawmakers rallied Wednesday behind President
Bush's decision to dispatch troops to Saudi Arabia, but cautioned
against U.S. forces defending the oil-rich nation without the help
of other countries.
   A key senator warned that ``the next 48 hours is crucial.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
told reporters in Atlanta that Iraq's president ``won't be bluffed.
But I don't think what we're doing is a bluff.''
   Chances of an attack on Saudi Arabia will decline if one does
not take place within 48 hours, Nunn said, adding, ``I hope and
pray there will not be an attack,'' but if there is one, ``it's
likely to come before we have all our intelligence in place.''
   ``The Arab countries must come to the party, too,'' Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas told reporters.
   ``I hope we will not be the `Lone Ranger' like we were in
Vietnam,'' Sen. Alan Cranston of California, second-ranking
Democrat, said in a telephone interview from Los Altos, Calif.
   The handful of senators and representatives still in the
nation's capital during a month-long recess also expressed concerns
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could act quickly to seize
Saudi oilfields before troops are in place.
   ``There is a danger of a hot war,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ``Saddam sees us
coming. He knows more troops will be there tomorrow and still more
next week. If he wants to move, now is better than later.''
   Aspin also commented that Abu Nidal, the leader of one of the
most infamous terrorist groups, ``is back in Baghdad. He (Saddam)
may be fixing to loose Abu Nidal on the world.''
   The overriding reaction on Capitol Hill from Democrats and
Republicans was praise for Bush's action, which calls for U.S.
troops to take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia to deter
further aggression from Iraq.
   The move was precipitated by Iraq's invasion and takeover of
Kuwait last week.
   Bush declined to discuss the size of the U.S. military force at
a news conference, but government sources said at least 5,000
ground troops were involved, along with 140 sophisticated fighters
and bombers and naval supply ships.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
supported Bush's decision and hoped ``this action, taken in
cooperation with other friendly nations, will deter an Iraqi attack
on Saudi Arabia and convince Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops
from occupied Kuwait.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said the ``participation of U.S. military
forces in the defense of Saudi Arabia is clearly justified as part
of the timely international effort to deter further Iraqi
aggression.''
   Bush must ``set foreign policy goals for a military action and
objectives which tell us whether the deployment is effective; the
president has done both,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``I applaud President Bush for his decision to send in American
forces to support Saudi Arabia against the threat of aggression
from Saddam Hussein. It is not just the Saudis who are at risk:
America's national security is at risk as well,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said the president was doing the right thing.
   ``This action puts U.S. forces in a position to inflict a very
punishing attack on Iraq if it should decide to invade Saudi
Arabia,'' Boren said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, another member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said he supported Bush's decision,
describing it as in the best interest of the United States and the
world.
   ``It is disappointing that more of the Arab nations are not
standing shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the world in
defending the independence and freedom of Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, ranking Republican on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was important ``that other
regional powers understand that the world will not put up with
naked aggression.''
   A senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Ike
Skelton, D-Mo., also stressed the importance of a joint operation.
``I hope other Arab states can get involved,'' Skelton said.
   Britain has said it would commit an unspecified number of its
forces but Egypt and Morocco denied reports from some U.S. sources
that they would participate in a multinational operation.
   ``I'd prefer to leave that to'' the Saudis to announce, Bush
told reporters when questioned about Arab involvement.
   Dole, asked about the length of time U.S. forces would
participate in the defense of Saudi Arabia, said the president
``left the clear impression this morning that this could be quite
long.''

   President Bush ordered U.S. troops and warplanes to the front
line of the explosive Persian Gulf standoff Tuesday to guard oil
giant Saudi Arabia against military giant Iraq.
   Capitol Hill sources said the troops would be part of a
multinational force, a condition set by the Saudis, and that Egypt
and Morocco were joining the attempt to deter Iraq's million-man
army from storming Saudi oil fields.
   A fresh U.S. Navy task force set sail for the region, meanwhile,
as an economic and military noose slowly tightened around Iraq.
   Turkey shut down the Iraqis' vital oil outlet to the
Mediterranean, honoring a U.N. trade embargo ordered to punish Iraq
for last week's lightning conquest of Kuwait. In Saudi Arabia, the
Iraqi oil flow was reported slowing to a trickle through another
pipeline.
   Despite the global pressure, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
remained defiant, declaring in a nationwide speech that he would
never back down and leave Kuwait.
   ``We would rather die than be humiliated,'' he said, ``and we
will pluck out the eyes of those who attack the Arab nation.''
   A crisis atmosphere took hold in official Washington, where Bush
called together his Cabinet to review options for squeezing Iraq
and rolling back its invasion force, which the White House declared
an ``imminent threat'' to outmanned Saudi Arabia.
   A Pentagon source later said the president ordered U.S. combat
troops and warplanes sent to Saudi Arabia to help protect the
U.S.-aligned desert kingdom against Iraq. The first U.S. Army units
reported headed out are specially trained and equipped for rapid
deployment in crisis zones.
   Pentagon sources said the units included the 18th Airborne
Corps, a command-and-control umbrella organization based at Ft.
Bragg, N.C.; the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division at Ft. Stewart,
Ga.; the 101st Airborne Division at Ft. Campbell, Ky., and the 82nd
Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg.
   Diplomats, meanwhile, worked to arrange for evacuation of
Americans and other foreigners stranded in Kuwait and Iraq.
   The State Department advised Americans not to travel to eastern
Saudi Arabia or the gulf states of Bahrain, Qatar, Oman or the
United Arab Emirates. Travel to Kuwait and Iraq has not been
possible since the invasion last week.
   One military option was a multinational naval blockade against
Iraq. But in Moscow, the Foreign Ministry deflated expectations
that the Soviet navy might join in, saying ``naval muscle-flexing
... is not the best line of action.''
   Early foreign reaction to the U.S. move described it as certain
to strengthen the Saudis, but unlikely to bring a swift end to
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   ``It is a protective measure,'' said Sir John Moberly, a former
British ambassador to Iraq who is now with the Royal Institute of
International Affairs in London. ``But I agree that to get Saddam
Hussein out of Kuwait is a very different question, and it's a very
long haul.''
   Aftershocks of the Gulf explosion still reverberated through the
world economy:
   _The Tokyo stock market fell sharply again Tuesday. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones average was down slightly. The London market
edged upward.
   _Crude oil prices continued to rise and stood one-third higher
than prices two weeks ago, driven up by fears of oil shortages.
   _Senate and House subcommittees met in Washington to investigate
what some called a ``rip-off'' by oil companies that raised
gasoline prices by as much as 19 cents a gallon after the invasion.
   Iraqi forces poured into Kuwait last Thursday after Saddam
complained that Kuwaiti overproduction had driven down world oil
prices and Iraqi oil revenues. He also accused Kuwait of stealing
oil from a border oilfield both countries claim.
   In his speech Tuesday, Saddam said the invasion rectified unjust
borders drawn up by colonial powers. The takeover of Kuwait gave
Iraq control of 9 percent of world daily oil production.
   A conquest of Saudi Arabia would raise the Iraq-controlled of
world oil to almost 20 percent. But the Iraqis have repeatedly
denied any plans for a follow-up invasion of Saudi Arabia.
   Many governments Tuesday were drawing up regulations to enforce
the anti-Iraq trade embargo ordered Monday by the U.N. Security
Council at U.S. urging. If fully enforced, the boycott could
cripple Iraq, which depends heavily on its oil exports for economic
survival.
   At a maritime terminal in southeastern Turkey, Turkish officials
began turning away tankers seeking to take on Iraqi oil and said
they would shut down the pipeline from Iraq within days, cutting
off more than half of Iraq's oil exports.
   At Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, terminus of Iraq's other key pipeline,
no tankers had loaded oil since the weekend, oil executives said.
They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said the oil flow had slowed to 200,000 barrels a day from
800,000 because of the sharp falloff in demand for Iraqi crude.

<HEAD>Survivors of Navy's Worst Sea Disaster to Hold Reunion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Glenn G. Morgan remembers the small purple
fish that darted around his life raft and the malt tablets he used
as bait to catch them in nets.
   He remembers catching rainwater in a tarpaulin, and the huge
shark that lunged halfway into the raft, then slid out just as
abruptly and swam away.
   But mostly Morgan remembers the elation 45 years ago when, after
five days adrift, he and about 300 other survivors of the USS
Indianapolis were pulled to safety.
   The cruiser was sunk by a Japanese submarine during World War II
in the worst disaster in U.S. maritime history. Nearly 900 crewmen
were killed.
   About 70 survivors and some of their rescuers gather in
Indianapolis, the ship's namesake, for a three-day reunion starting
Friday. They have traveled here every five years since 1960. Morgan
expects more than 350 people to attend.
   The Indianapolis was sunk halfway between Guam and the
Philippines on July 30, 1945. Two days earlier it had unloaded key
parts of the atomic bomb at Tinian, where the Enola Gay would take
off on its flight to end World War II.
   Most of the ship's 1,196 crewmen were asleep. Morgan, a
21-year-old buglemaster third class, had just gotten off watch and
was on the bridge.
   ``When I hit the water off the side of the ship, I swam away
from it because I'd always heard it would suck you under,'' he said
in a recent telephone interview from his home in Franklin, Texas.
   Clutching a rubber tube he often had used as a pillow, Morgan
stayed afloat and watched in the moonlight as the ship tilted on
its end, propellers still churning, then slipped underwater _ all
within 12 minutes.
   Morgan caught sight of four life rafts and crawled into one with
about 20 colleagues.
   Most crewmen weren't so fortunate. Those who found life jackets
bobbed in the oily water with no rations. Others were eaten alive
by sharks or succumbed to their injuries.
   Morgan's raft was equipped with rations, small kegs of water and
a first-aid kit. A couple of the men were badly burned. One died
the next day.
   The raft drifted away from the others _ 45 miles away when they
finally were rescued.
   The isolation was terrifying, Morgan said.
   ``Nobody knew we were sunk. That was the brutal thing about
this,'' he said. ``We were beginning to get down in the mouth after
being in the water four and a half days.''
   But they kept their spirits up by fishing, scanning the horizon
and watching a big shark.
   ``We called him Charlie. Every time we'd throw a Spam can over,
he'd get real curious and he'd come around,'' Morgan said. Although
it did lunge into the raft once, ``Old Charlie never got violent,
by golly,'' Morgan said.
   On the fifth day, aviator Wilbur Gwinn spotted some survivors
during a routine patrol, and rescuers were alerted.
   One of them was Graham Claytor, commander of the destroyer Cecil
J. Doyle.
   ``The warm spot I have for Graham Claytor was that ... he broke
some Navy regulations by turning on the big blue searchlights,''
Morgan said. ``They certainly looked good to me. Oh, how good they
looked.''
   Claytor went on to become secretary of the Navy and is now
president of Amtrak.
   The survivors were taken to hospital ships and medical centers
at Guam and the Philippines. When they were fit, they were reunited
in San Diego.
   Their skipper, Capt. Charles McVay III, was the only captain
ever court-martialed for the loss of his ship in battle. He was
charged with failing to take evasive maneuvers, or zigzag, in
dangerous waters.
   McVay shot himself to death with his Navy pistol in 1968 at his
home in Litchfield, Conn. Some of his crew believe he was a
scapegoat, Morgan said.

<HEAD>Modern Lombard League Seeks Autonomy from Rome</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Winds of independence, blown from the
north by an 800-year-old ghost incarnate, are giving Rome a few
shivers.
   Northern politicians have revived the Lombard League, a 12th
century alliance of autonomy-loving cities that fought the
oppression of the Holy Roman Empire.
   They want to remove Lombardy, the most productive part of Italy,
from the grasp of a slow-moving, tax-eating, notoriously
inefficient central government.
   Rome was stunned this spring by the league's strong showing in
local elections. It became the second-ranked party in the region,
behind Premier Giulio Andreotti's Christian Democrats.
   Part of the Lombard League's popularity stems from northern
resentment of Rome for sending workers from the underdeveloped
south for the past 40 years to deliver their mail, teach their
children and police their streets.
   Northerners have disdained some of those jobs, particularly
police work, because of the low pay and high risk. Others jobs,
such as teaching, are based on national competitions the
northerners claim are weighted in favor of people from the south.
   In addition, many bureaucratic posts are political appointments,
and northerners say southerners get most of them.
   The league wants to end a virtual open-door policy that is
bringing a tide of poor immigrants to Italy. Most of the latest
arrivals are poor, from North Africa and Asia.
   On a wall of the league headquarters, in a working-class
district of Milan, is a poster showing a plump chicken whose golden
eggs tumble into a basket held by a fat farmer's wife. As the
league sees it, the chicken is productive Lombardy and the peasant
woman a parasitic south.
   Lombard League newspapers denounce Rome for, they say, using
money from the north for wasteful development programs in the south.
   Hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into construction
projects in the Naples area after the 1980 earthquake there, for
example, but thousands of people made homeless by the disaster
still live in makeshift housing.
   Sen. Umberto Bossi said in an interview the party wants Italy to
become a federalist state with the central government's role
limited to defense, foreign policy, taxes and some judicial matters.
   Bossi, league president and its only member of Parliament, looks
to Switzerland, Lombardy's neighbor across the Alps, as a model.
   Many Lombards say they identify more with the rest of Europe
than with Italy, whose international image often is that of the
south.
   Soccer may well be country's strongest bond, but north-south
bitterness emerged even during the World Cup competition Italy
hosted this summer.
   Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona, who plays for Naples
during the regular season, was booed for trying to get his fans to
root for Argentina when it played the Italian national team in
Naples. He was accused of exploiting north-south hatreds.
   ``I never said that the Neapolitans should root for Argentina,''
he said later. ``I just made a few observations ... like the
banners in Verona,'' when Naples played there, ``that said `Wash
yourselves' and `Welcome to Italy'.''
   Charges that the League is racist make some northerners cautious
in expressing sympathy for the party. Bossi rejects the racist
label.
   ``I didn't vote for the league, but some of my friends did,''
said Claudio Tarini on the train ride home to Milan from Rome,
where he had spent two days dealing with the bureaucracy to obtain
the necessary permits for a business trip to Nigeria.
   While racism undoubtedly motivated some to vote for the league,
Tarini said, public disgust with Rome was the principal reason for
the election success.
   As a newspaper columnist wrote in describing the average
citizen's entanglements with clerks and paperwork to meet ordinary
requirements of daily life: ``Will I have to vote for the league to
get a driver's license?''
   The column appeared in La Stampa, a national daily based in
Turin, capital of the Piedmont, which borders Lombardy and has its
own regional party.
   Bossi says the League will begin collecting signatures in
September to force a referendum on a law that allowed tens of
thousands of Third World immigrants to stay in Italy.
   After his election to the Senate in 1987, Bossi sponsored a bill
that stopped the practice of sending convicted Mafiosi from the
south to internal exile in northern towns.

   Bong Jae Jang rises before dawn and goes to the
Brooklyn Terminal Market, where he stocks up on green plantain,
Haitian mangos and other fruits and vegetables popular with the
Caribbean immigrants who used to shop at his store on Church Avenue
in Flatbush.
   These days, Jang's trip is an academic exercise; he knows most
of the produce will sit unsold on the shelf, rot in the July heat
and wind up in the trash bin outside.
   ``Who's going to buy this?'' he asks, holding up a
cellophane-wrapped hunk of a vegetable called pium kim that is
besieged by a swarm of tiny flies.
   After six months, a black-led boycott of Jang's greengrocery
continues, even though the television cameras are gone and the
pickets who gather outside the front door each afternoon have
dwindled to a handful.
   The boycotters' avowed aim is to force the store to close.
   Jang's troubles began Jan. 18, when Giselaine Felissaint, a
Haitian immigrant, got into an argument with several of his
employees over some merchandise. One of them touched her. She says
the man knocked her down; another employee says the man put his
hands on her and she laid down.
   Five months passed before the store's manager, Pong Ok Jang, was
charged with assault, but the incident immediately became a symbol
of the tensions between the city's black and Korean communities.
   Within a few months, hundreds of demonstrators were gathering
outside the store each day, along with almost as many police and
journalists. Pickets yelled racial slurs at the Koreans and urged
them to ``go back to where you came from.''
   Tensions were heightened by the trial of some white youths
accused of killing a black youth in the Bensonhurst section. In a
special televised speech to the city, Mayor David Dinkins pleaded
for calm and understanding.
   The problem runs far beyond a simple assault charge. Many blacks
resent the way they are treated in some of the Korean grocery
stores that have opened in their communities, and some are jealous
of the immigrants' business success. The self-employed account for
6.7 percent of all city workers, but only 3.4 percent of all black
workers.
   Skeptics derided the boycott as a news media creation that would
end as soon as the last camera crew departed. They were wrong. By 5
p.m., there usually are about a dozen demonstrators behind the blue
police barricades that line the sidewalk outside the store. Few
neighborhood residents defy their cries of ``Boycott!'' and venture
inside or visit another Korean grocery across the street.
   ``The stores have become a symbol of what has happened across
this city in terms of the lack of recognizing the humanity of black
people,'' says George Dames, a spokesman for the Flatbush Coalition
for Economic Empowerment, a boycott group. ``It was not an isolated
incident.''
   Since May, however, ``tensions there have been lessening, if not
dramatically, then incrementally,'' says Lonnie Soury, spokesman
for the city's Human Rights Commission.
   The Rev. Roy Thompson of St. Paul's Episcopal Church agrees: ``I
can drive by the store without getting stuck in traffic for a
half-hour.''
   Dinkins has appointed a fact-finding panel and called for an end
to the boycott, but none seems likely soon. There still have been
no direct negotiations between the Korean and Haitian communities,
let alone Jang and Mrs. Felissaint. She has refused to denounce the
boycott and has filed a $6 million suit against the store.
   ``People say, `End it,' but we can't just wave a magic wand,''
says Soury of the human rights commission, which is trying to get
talks started.
   ``We're trying to identify leaders who represent those with
legitimate interests. There are people who don't have an interest
in settling the issue,'' he says. ``We think that if we can get a
group of people who can meet, we can make progress. But they're not
meeting now.''
   According to a poll taken last month, only 13 percent of New
Yorkers supported the boycott, while 58 percent supported the
Koreans. Among blacks, only 27 percent sympathized with the
boycotters, while 37 percent sided with the Koreans. Boycott
leaders say the results simply reflected biased news coverage.
   Jang, 35, says he came here in 1983 and worked for five years at
another store before opening his own. Before the boycott, he says,
he routinely worked 17 hours a day, and was robbed three times. He
shows off the scar where a robber's bullet entered his abdomen last
year.
   His business is being sustained largely by $5,000 to $7,000 a
month in donations from the city's other Korean grocers. ``They
will support him until the boycott is over,'' says Michael Kang of
the Korean Produce Association. ``He is their Maginot Line. They
think they're going to be next.''
   Jang is infuriated by the refusal of the police department to
enforce a judge's order that the protesters be kept 50 feet from
his door. The city has appealed, arguing that the police should be
allowed to use discretion in deciding where the protesters should
stand.
   Jang says neither Dinkins nor Police Commissioner Lee Brown
wants to stand up to the boycotters, and pass responsibility for
dealing with them back and forth. He does not speak English very
clearly, but he gets his point across: ``They play a ping-pong
game. They killing my dream.''
   To Soury, the boycott is a tragedy. ``Two immigrant groups are
pitted against each other,'' he says, ``when they should be
fighting together to demand more government aid for small
businesses _ for blacks and Koreans and everyone else.''

DELETES outdated material. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>POZA RICA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Diana battered Mexico's Gulf
Coast with 85 mph winds Tuesday, toppling trees and electricity
poles in Poza Rica, 25 miles inland, Federal Highway Police said.
   Red Cross spokesman Moises Gutierrez Pina said by telephone that
at least one person was injured, adding, ``I don't doubt that there
are more.''
   Hundreds of residents fled low-lying areas before Diana hit and
hundreds more were left homeless in this city surrounded by oil
fields.
   Police said 120 families were evacuated from their flooded homes
in two city neighborhoods. About 300 more people were taken to
makeshift shelters when the storm blew the roofs off their houses.
   The Veracruz state government reported many areas were without
electricity, dozens of roads in the Gulf Coast area were blocked by
fallen trees, and at least 14 towns had no telephone service.
   Journalists driving through the area said storm damage extended
as far inland as Huachinango, a town about 90 miles southwest of
Poza Rica.
   The government news agency Notimex said the army was preparing
to declare an emergency in the area and send in food and other
relief.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the eye of the storm was about 80 miles west
of the Gulf Coast town of Tuxpan, according to the U.S. National
Hurricane Center near Miami. Tuxpan is 180 miles northeast of
Mexico City.
   The storm was moving in a westerly direction at 10 mph, with
winds diminished to 45 mph, the center said.
   It said people in mountainous areas north of Mexico City were
threatened by flash floods and mud slides from heavy rains.
   Diana carried 90 mph winds while still at sea, and winds of up
to 85 mph when it hit the coastal regions.
   Telephone lines to Tuxpan were out. The Red Cross and highway
police in Poza Rica, on higher ground 30 miles southwest of Tuxpan,
said they had no radio contact with the coastal town.
   Poza Rica police said Diana blew down palms and other trees and
power lines, cutting off electricity to Poza Rica. Fallen trees and
telephone lines blocked some streets but major roads to the city
were open, the Red Cross said.
   Gutierrez Pina said a man in Poza Rica was cut when hit by
falling roof tiles, and that another person was treated for
hysteria.
   Small craft were warned to remain in port from Baffin Bay,
Texas, southward. Phone lines to some cities along the 400-mile
stretch of Mexican coast threatened by the storm were out.
   One man was killed Monday night in Veracruz, down the coast from
Tuxpan, when winds blew over a tree, said Rosalio Romero Hernandez,
a Red Cross spokesman in Veracruz.
   Rainfall of 10 inches or more was expected along Diana's path,
said Max Mayfield, a specialist at the U.S. National Hurricane
Center near Miami. Tides were expected to be four to six feet above
normal, he said.
   ``The main threat to life will be the rising waters on the coast
and the heavy rains producing flash floods and possibly mud slides
inland,'' said Mayfield.
   A tropical storm warning was in place from La Pesca to Boca
Jesus Maria, about 100 miles south of Brownsville, Texas.
   Tropical storm force winds extended up to 200 miles out from the
center, the weather service said.
   Diana is the second storm of the Atlantic season to reach
hurricane strength. As a tropical storm, it soaked Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula on Monday but did little damage.
   Tropical Storm Cesar, meanwhile, weakened to a tropical
depression and was in the mid-Atlantic about 1,150 miles
east-southeast of Bermuda with top sustained winds of nearly 35 mph.
   Tropical depressions become named storms once sustained winds
reach 39 mph. A storm becomes a hurricane when winds hit 74 mph.

<HEAD>Movement Against Official English Grows in India</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A growing movement is afoot to rid India
of a pervasive vestige of the British colonial Raj: the English
language.
   It won't be easy.
   English is the language of law, government and some of the best
modern Indian literature.
   It is spoken by the wealthy and well-educated who have dominated
politics and business since independence in 1945. They often are
called, derisively, the Brown Sahibs.
   Kapil Kapoort, a linguistics professor, predicted the movement
would grow because knowledge of English ``provides privileges to a
few, but it deprives privileges to many.''
   Experts estimate 35 million Indians know some English. That is
more than the population of Canada, double that of Australia and
about half the number of people in Britain, but only 4 percent
India's 880 million.
   Anti-English sentiment has arisen periodically, sometimes
accompanied by violence. This year, the campaign has gone farther
than before toward eliminating English from official business in
some of India's 25 states.
   Mulayam Singh Yadav, who leads the government of Uttar Pradesh,
the most populous state, banned the official use of English in
April. He instructed the courts to conduct their business
exclusively in Hindi, the language of about 200 mllion people in
northern India.
   Yadav also suggested forbidding English as the language of
instruction in private schools, where the children of many
well-to-do Indians are educated.
   Two other Hindi-speaking states in northern and central India
have ordered all official correspondence and public announcements
made in Hindi.
   In Goa, on the southwest coast, the local government tried to
cut off public funds for English-language schools and teachers
blocked the main highway for three days in protest.
   At a seminar in New Delhi last month, Yadav of Utter Pradesh
said: ``I will happily accept any Indian language as our national
language, but English must go.''
   There are plenty of indigenous tongues to choose from.
   India has 15 recognized official languages, including English. A
census in 1971 indicated 1,652 languages and dialects were spoken,
33 of them by more than a million people each.
   English billboards and signs rule the streets of New Delhi, in
the heart of the Hindi belt. One-fourth of all the newspapers
circulated in India are in English, as are 40 percent of the books,
said publisher Ravi Dayal.
   ``It's not that easy to get rid of English,'' said M.P. Chhaya,
a consultant for the Education Department. ``It's only possible if
one common language besides English is accepted. That won't happen
soon.''
   One advantage of English is its neutrality. Although Hindi is by
far the most widely spoken language, southern Indians say adopting
it as the official national tongue would amount to accepting
northern domination.
   Chhaya said in an interview: ``English was thrust on us by the
British. They were the rulers and we had no choice. Now we are a
democracy. You can't thrust Hindi down everyone's throat.''
   Even politicians who rail most loudly against English send their
children to English-language schools, he said.
   In the English-language Indian Express, publisher Dayal wrote:
``Regional languages now dominate administrative activity in the
states. English has its own niche in the government at the Center
(federal level) and in communications with the states, in the
higher courts, in some universities.''
   Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayed, questioned in Parliament
about his sincerity in promoting Indian languages, admitted his
office had 633 typewriters in English and only 57 in the Devnagri
script used for Hindi.
   ``The constitution was written in English,'' said Kapoor,
director of the Center for Linguistics and English at Jawaharlal
Nehru University. ``Maybe 98 percent of the people can't read it,
but they are supposed to swear by it.''
   ``English is an instrument for making people feel inferior,'' he
said in an interview.
   Persian was the administrative language of the Mogul emperors
who united most of India in the 16th century, then English became
the tongue that linked the nation together.
   Sanskrit, ons and the medium of
India's classics, has been dead as a spoken idiom for 1,000 years.
   After 40 years of studying English, Kapoor said, he began to
appreciate his own culture when he discovered the importance of
Sanskrit and early Indian literature to Western thinkers.
   ``In this prestigious university, there is no department or
chair in Sanskrit,'' he said. ``We have chairs in all kinds of
classical languages, but not our own.''
   Resentment of India's ruling class feeds the anti-English
movement.
   ``They are a class of people deliberately created by the
British,'' Kapoor said. ``They are English in taste and opinion,
and Indian in blood and color.''

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life in Monrovia has collapsed into
random terror and widespread starvation as rebel forces close in on
beleaguered President Samuel Doe.
   Since rebels began besieging the capital a few weeks ago, Doe's
troops have been ransacking shops, restaurants, warehouses, offices
and homes.
   In the morning, countless dead bodies bear witness to the random
violence of the night before. Some are headless, others are missing
parts of skulls or limbs. Liberians say the missing parts are used
in cannibalistic rituals by soldiers of Doe's Krahn tribe.
   A coconut plantation near Monrovia's beaches has become known as
``the killing field'' because of the number of corpses dumped there
daily in troughs dug by bulldozers. Civilians blame Doe's troops
for the killings.
   The stench of rotting bodies pervades Monrovia, a city scarred
by rocket and mortar fire.
   But the rebels have also been blamed for killings.
   In one incident last week, Prince Johnson, a rebel leader, shot
a Liberian man wearing a Red Cross bib twice as he pleaded for his
life.
   Johnson had accused the man, who was handcuffed to a foreign
relief services worker, of profiteering from rice sales.
   ``You are traitor,'' Johnson said as he fired a burst of fire
from his AK-47 assault rifle at the man.
   The man fell to the ground, wounded, and lifted his head.
   ``Why, why?'' he asked.
   Pointing at the dying man Johnson said to the French relief
worker, Jacques Monthouroy: ``You are lucky you are a foreign
diplomat.'' He then fired another burst at the pleading Liberian
man, killing him.
   The victim's identify was not known. Monthouroy, a Frenchman
working for the U.S. Catholic Relief Services was released after
the U.S. Embassy vouched for him.
   Rice, the staple of Liberia's 2.3 million people, is scarce in
the capital. Starving Monrovians eat grass and weeds from seaside
swamps and river banks to survive.
   The city's water supply was cut nearly two months ago. People
scoop water from creeks, drains and ponds. Crowds stampede into
gardens of homes with wells.
   No car is safe from robbery by Doe troops, who menace occupants
including ambassadors, relief workers and Liberian legislators with
their rifles.
   In late July, Johnson won control of the city's northern Bushrod
Island suburb and two bridges linking it to downtown Monrovia,
where Doe is holed up in his heavily fortified cliffside mansion.
   Johnson's guerilla rival, Charles Taylor, has moved into
Monrovia's eastern suburb of Paynesville and randomly slaughtered
civilians of the Krahn and Mandingo tribes. The Mandingo are
accused of supporting Doe.
   Doe's troops have targeted civilians of the Gio and Mano tribes,
which support the rebels.
   The rebels invaded Liberia in December, accusing Doe of
corruption and human rights abuses.
   Relief workers are often accused of taking sides in the war. The
International Committee of the Red Cross, which had given its
protection to refugees at St. Peter's Lutheran Church where 600
refugees were massacred, said its two representatives in Monrovia
were in hiding and incapable of protecting refugees.
   When Johnson began distributing rice to starving Monrovians, his
soldiers had to fire into the air to control the huge crowds that
came begging for food.
   They later began firing at knee level, wounding at least four
people, including a 24-year-old woman.

<HEAD>Mysterious Woman Pays Fines For Convicted Pro-Democracy Activists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious woman has paid the fines for five
pro-democracy activists convicted of illegally using megaphones and
collecting money without a permit.
   Court officials said a woman in black, who declined to identify
herself, paid the fines, totaling about $100, on Monday.
   The five activists had refused to pay the fines, saying they
would rather go to jail. They said they did not know the mystery
woman or her motives for helping them.
   Their supporters have described the case as a ``show trial''
aimed at suppressing political activity in this British crown
colony. They accuse Britain of bowing to China, which will regain
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 and is opposed to a faster pace
of democracy for Hong Kong.
   The five were prosecuted under a 1933 law that forbids the use
of bullhorns. The law has rarely been invoked and is widely ignored
by teachers and tour guides who use bullhorns.
   The five activists, members of the United Democrats of Hong
Kong, have appealed their July 27 conviction.
   ``The prosecution against us is clearly politically motivated
and we will continue to appeal,'' said one of the activists, Yeung
Sum, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong.
   Although their fines have been paid, Yeung said the activists
will still seek a court hearing on their appeal.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress'
decision to end its armed struggle against the South African
government is just a first step in what promises to be a long and
difficult quest for peace.
   There is no guarantee the two sides will find a peaceful
solution to three centuries of racial conflict. There is growing
violence and the threat of major confrontation as rival groups
struggle for power.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela announced Tuesday after talks with the
government that his group was ending its military operations. The
cease-fire clears the way for talks on ending white-minority rule.
   ``The way is now open to proceed towards negotiations on a new
constitution,'' the two sides said in a joint declaration.
   The two sides have made enormous strides since President F.W. de
Klerk legalized the ANC and other opposition groups in February and
freed Mandela after 27 years in jail. In just a few months, the
white government that created apartheid has pledged to share power
with the black majority.
   But both sides admit that this is just a beginning.
   South Africa's racial conflict has been going on for some 350
years. In that time there have been virtually no attempts to have
blacks and whites live together in peace and equality.
   Political violence has soared since de Klerk legalized
opposition groups and began political reforms. Most of the violence
pits rival black factions against each other as they scramble for
power.
   Some 4,000 blacks have been killed in savage fighting in Natal
Province in recent years between ANC groups and Inkatha, a
conservative political movement. The violence is spreading to other
provinces and enveloping other groups.
   The violence seems to be growing despite repeated promises from
the ANC and the government to make every effort to stop the
killings.
   The peace process also faces violent resistance from right-wing
whites who oppose any settlement with the black majority. The
extremists have demanded the creation of a separate white state.
   White extremists have been implicated in a recent wave of
bombings and killings. Security officials say even a few dozen
white extremists, heavily armed and with supporters in the security
forces, could cause havoc.
   Enormous divisions remain between whites and blacks. Each group
has little understanding or knowledge of the other. Contact between
most whites and blacks is minimal and there is enormous distrust
and fear on both sides.
   Whites still dominate politics and the economy. Official figures
indicate that 5 percent of South Africans, virtually all of them
white, own 88 percent of the country's wealth.
   The ANC and other opposition groups contend that political
equality must be matched by a drastic redistribution of wealth to
quickly ease the plight of the millions of poor blacks. The
government agrees there is a need for change, but opposes any
scheme that would threaten free enterprise and private property.
   Some observers fear that if a government led by the ANC attempts
to ease black poverty by redistributing wealth by legislation or
other means it could provoke a white revolt. Others say it will
wreck the economy.
   De Klerk has indicated he is seeking guarantees under any future
black majority government that will leave whites with considerable
power and wealth.
   There are indications some ANC leaders believe the negotiations
are to arrange a hand over of power. Such a misunderstanding could
make it very difficult for the two sides to find a workable
compromise.

<TEXT>
   Iraq has stepped up its efforts to jam the
Arabic-language broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corp. World
Service, the BBC said.
   The BBC expanded its Arabic-language broadcasts from nine to 10{
hours a day last week following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   BBC engineers have detected interference with the World
Service's Arabic transmissions on a range of short-wave frequencies
serving the Middle East.
   They have traced the jamming to a site south of Baghdad, the BBC
said Tuesday. English-language broadcasts have not been affected.
   ``Jamming the BBC is always the last resort of those who wish to
suppress the truth _ and in a way it is a tribute to the role of
the World Service at times of crisis,'' said David Witherow, deputy
managing director of the BBC World Service.
   ``Jamming is never entirely effective and I am sure that
listeners throughout the region are relying on the BBC for news,''
he said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasting weather is an imprecise science, at
best, but the chance that people might heed a bleak forecast that
doesn't come true has some Massachusetts restaurant operators up in
arms.
   All too often, complains Frank Catania, a television weather
forecaster will predict rain or snow, and instead the sun will
shine over empty tables at his restaurants.
   ``They're not God. They're going to make mistakes,'' Catania
said.
   While many people would like more detail in the forecasts, and a
warning of even a chance of rain or snow that might affect their
lives, some people in the restaurant business have mounted a
campaign to get television prognosticators to tone down their
predictions.
   ``We're not asking them to say the weather's always going to be
nice,'' said Cindy Eid, public affairs coordinator for the
Massachusetts Restaurant Association. ``We're looking for some
responsibility on their part.''
   The restaurant group has formed a ``weather task force,'' which
aims to educate meteorologists about the way their nightly
forecasts can affect business.
   The group especially doesn't like five-day forecasts.
   Bruce Schwoegler, a forecaster for WBZ-TV in Boston, says he is
always careful to call that a ``five day outlook,'' trying to draw
a distinction with short-range forecasts that tend to be more
reliable.
   Schwoegler said he also has told viewers not to make their
weekend plans based on Monday's weather predictions.
   John Orgler, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
Boston, said he, too, would not encourage people to make plans
based on long-range predictions.
   ``It only makes sense to wait for the day before to get
something more reliable and up to date,'' he said.
   But the restaurateurs think that apparently hasn't sunk in with
some people. The restaurant group has collected letters from
members around the state to illustrate their point.
   E. Thomas McCabe Jr., president of Tom Foolery's in Westboro,
described how on more than one occasion, no snowstorms materialized
after ``alarmist'' weather forecasts, ``turning $13,000 Fridays
into $7,000 Fridays.''
   Even the prestigious Harvard Club of Boston joined in. A letter
from the club said a weather forecaster who ``cried wolf'' last
year led to the cancellation of a dinner for 250 people.
   The industry is especially sensitive on Cape Cod, where people
will make weekend plans well in advance.
   Catania, vice president of Dan'l Webster-Hearth 'n Kettle, which
runs an inn and several restaurants on the Cape, recalled how a TV
forecaster earlier this year advised people to scrap their Sunday
golf plans because it was going to rain.
   ``Guess what? I played golf on Sunday on the Cape and I got a
suntan,'' he said.
   Some restaurant operators suggest weather forecasters simply add
a few more cautionary phrases to their delivery, and refrain from
``sensationalized'' pronouncements.
   ``We're not trying to impinge on their creative talents,'' Eid
said. ``We just want them to be aware that there are economic
implications when they make forecasts.''

   President Bush on Tuesday dispatched American
warplanes and ground troops to Saudi Arabia where sources said a
multinational military force was being created to defend the
vulnerable oil kingdom from attack by Iraq.
   Capitol Hill sources said Egypt and Morocco were joining the
effort, part of an accelerating international response to Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
   While using an oil embargo in an effort to reverse the Kuwaiti
invasion, allied forces hoped the unusual multinational defense of
Saudi Arabia would deter Saddam's million-man Iraqi army from
storming the Saudi oil fields as well.
   There was no announcement from the White House of the military
moves. Word came from authoritative Pentagon sources and from
Capitol Hill. The White House said President Bush would address the
nation on television at 9 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``We're not playing games. There are strategic reasons why I
can't tell you,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. He
declared, ``We believe there is an imminent threat to Saudi
Arabia.''
   Plans drawn up by U.S. officials called for the international
force to serve as a ``trip wire'' to deter Saddam.
   Explaining the government's reasoning for pulling together
troops from a number of nations to protect the Saudi kingdom's
outnumbered 38,000-man army, one Pentagon official said: ``If
Saddam Hussein sees a group of Saudi, American, Moroccan _ and even
German _ soldiers staring at him across the border, he may have
little inclination to move any further.''
   In what appeared to be an effort to enlist America's European
partners in Iraqi sanctions or the Saudi defense effort, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III made plans to meet Friday in Brussels
with the foreign ministers of the 15 U.S. allies in Europe after a
quick consultation trip to Turkey.
   The New York Times said in Wednesday editions that the United
States was prepared to invite the Soviet Union to participate in an
international naval blockade, and had ``signalled'' to the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France that a blockading force would be
needed soon.
   In Moscow, however, the Soviet Foreign Ministry, called a
blockade ``not the best line'' to take.
   The Washington Post said Britain had agreed to cooperate in a
blockade. Both newspapers attributed their reports to unidentified
U.S. officials.
   The Post also said unidentified U.S. intelligence officials
reported that Iraqi forces appeared to have been loading poison gas
aboard combat aircraft Tuesday. Iraq has a large stock of chemical
weapons and has used them against Kurdish rebels as well as against
Iranian troops in its 1980-1988 war with Iran.
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified
by name, said they expected Army units heading for Saudi Arabia to
include elements of the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg,
N.C.; the 24th Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. and the
101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky., near Clarksville,
Tenn. The 82nd and the 101st make up the 18th Airborne Corps.
   The three divisions together would total about 44,800 soldiers,
if all elements of each division, including a Georgia National
Guard Brigade in the 24th, were assembled.
   The airborne divisions would protect Saudi air bases, so that
other troops, aircraft and equipment can be sent in. A
congressional source said Bush had decided to send F-16 fighters,
F-15 fighters and tanker aircraft from bases within the United
States, adding to the option of using fighter aircraft from Navy
carriers.
   NBC News said Tuesday evening that Special Forces troops had
been in Saudi Arabia for the previous 24 hours.
   Meantime, the carrier Saratoga and four escort ships steamed out
of Mayport Naval Station in Florida on a week's voyage to the
Mediterranean. The battleship Wisconsin was to leave Norfolk, Va.,
too, joining the Eisenhower and the carrier Independence in the
region.
   Pentagon sources said the Eisenhower would pass through the Suez
Canal Tuesday night en route to the Persian Gulf.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said if the deployments in Saudi Arabia were taking
place as reported, ``I think this is the right thing to do. ... It
discourages Iraq from invading.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the reported deployment would amount to a
``clear signal of our commitment to defend Saudi Arabia from a
possible Iraqi attack.''
   But, he said the United States ``should not expect that Saudi
Arabia will implement United Nations sanctions against Iraq and
close the Iraqi oil pipeline through its territory.''
   The Bush administration has asked the Saudis to shut off the
flow of Iraqi oil through its territory, as Turkey said it would
Tuesday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was in Egypt Tuesday to seek that
country's cooperation and later traveled to Morocco to discuss the
situation with King Hassan. His whirlwind tour had begun with a
stop in Saudi Arabia.
   Fitzwater said Bush told his Cabinet ``that he views the Iraqi
troops lined up in Kuwait facing Saudi Arabia as a threat to United
States security interests.''
   The spokesman also reported that in a tense, two-hour session
Monday between Saddam and the highest ranking American official in
Iraq, charge d'affaires Joseph Wilson, ``Saddam indicated he had no
intention of leaving Kuwait and had every indication of staying and
claiming it as his own.''
   The Iraqi leader underscored that reading in a message over
Baghdad radio in which he defended the invasion as necessary to
correct flawed regional borders drawn up by colonial powers.
   The invasion marked ``a new period in which the sun will shine
on us in the coming days,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Fitzwater would not comment on a Washington Post report that
Saddam had warned Wilson that he would attack Saudi Arabia if his
pipeline through that country were cut off. Two State Department
officials, insisting on anonymity, said Saddam leveled no such
threat.
   Elsewhere, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez promised to
do everything he could to make up the 4.5 million barrel-a-day
shortfall in oil stemming from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, an
administration official traveling with Vice President Dan Quayle
said. Quayle met Perez while both were in Bogota for the
inauguration of Cesar Gaviria as president of Colombia.
   Perez was quoted as telling Quayle that Venezuela and other OPEC
states were working to stabilize oil prices at or near the cartel's
agreed price of $21 a barrel. The price has soared to more than $28
a barrel since the invasion.
   The New York Times said in Wednesday editions that Saudi Arabia
was expected to increase output by 2 million barrels a day, about a
40 percent increase.
   Bush had declared on Monday that sanctions approved 13-0 by the
United Nations Security Council ``will be enforced, whatever it
takes.'' But on Tuesday he had nothing to add, saying at the White
House, ``I'm just not going to take any questions today, thanks.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said an international naval blockade to isolate Iraq _
which depends on imported food _ is ``very likely unless the Iraqis
back off and start moving out of Kuwait,'' undoing last week's
invasion.
   Concern over the fate of Americans and other Westerners trapped
in Baghdad appeared to ease.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that 28
Americans picked up Monday by Iraqi troops in Kuwait have turned up
in a Baghdad hotel but ``are not being allowed to leave.''

   The gaily painted carousel on the National
Mall is still taking tourists on a gentle musical swing through
yesteryear, but officials at the Smithsonian Institution's nearby
headquarters are bracing for a bumpy financial ride into the future.
   Anticipating a new era of austerity after a quarter-century of
extraordinary expansion, the Smithsonian is delaying the start of
several major construction and renovation projects and searching
for ways to trim its costly payroll of 6,600 employees.
   At the moment, Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian,
is gratified that a House subcommittee recently voted to boost his
federal appropriation next year by nearly 18 percent, from $267
million to $313 million, even more than he had requested.
   Nevertheless, Adams is worried about ominous portents of a
long-term budget squeeze, including economic disruptions from the
Persian Gulf crisis and the threat of ``almost unbelievably
devastating'' automatic spending cuts in mid-October under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   ``The Smithsonian has been generously treated for a very long
time,'' Adams said recently. ``But I think it is the case that the
numbers are large enough now that we cannot expect them to continue
as they have in the past.''
   ``We have to face the fact that we are likely to grow more
slowly in the years ahead,'' he said in a telephone interview from
his vacation home in Basalt, Colo.
   An early casualty of the impending budget crunch was
Undersecretary Dean W. Anderson, who resigned in late July as
Adams' day-to-day overseer of the sprawling Smithsonian complex of
14 museums and galleries, plus the National Zoo.
   After 17 boom years at the Smithsonian, Anderson made clear he
had little stomach for presiding over personnel and program
cutbacks in future years of retrenchment and streamlining of
managerial staff.
   Anderson's resignation resulted in scare headlines suggesting
that the Smithsonian had plunged into a severe financial crisis.
Adams wrote a letter to the editor of The Washington Post
complaining that the press reports ``may leave the public with the
erroneous impression that the Smithsonian is about to close its
doors.''
   The Smithsonian is still very much in business, but the growing
budgetary pinch that it shares with other federal agencies may be
more visible at the Smithsonian's vast cultural and scientific
enterprises, which attracted 24.2 million visitors last year.
   The National Museum of Natural History, for example, has more
than 50 staff vacancies, leaving gaps in the museum's far-flung
research activities and threatening to delay curatorial work for
future exhibitions.
   In April, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden temporarily
closed an entire floor of its galleries of modern art because it
couldn't afford to pay the guards. The National Museum of American
History has abandoned its school programs, bilingual activities and
its plans to bolster hiring of minority staffers.
   The Smithsonian receives virtually no federal money to mount
major exhibitions, even though 84 percent of its current $353
million budget comes from congressional appropriations and the rest
from various trust funds, gifts and profit-making ventures.
   As a result, American History was forced to rely on computer and
telecommunications industry donors to finance its ambitious
``Information Age'' show which opened in May, raising questions
about corporate influence over exhibition content.
   The National Air and Space Museum desperately needs additional
storage space, but Adams says construction of a planned $330
million museum extension at Dulles International Airport may be in
jeopardy if budget cuts require postponement of building plans.
   At the National Zoo, Director Michael Robinson said ``additional
budget cuts could have grave consequences'' by forcing the zoo to
suspend modernization projects and curtail education, conservation
and research activities.
   Adams said his major priorities are to build a $175 million
National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall _ the
Smithsonian's 15th museum _ and decide what form an
African-American ``presence'' should take in Washington.
   He also is determined to expand cultural diversity at the
Smithsonian, with greater focus on minority interests, and pursue
research and education on protecting the environment.
   Last week, the White House budget office told the Smithsonian to
begin preparing for a 32 percent spending cut if budget negotiators
fail to meet Gramm-Rudman's deficit reduction target by the Oct. 1
start of the fiscal year.
   To compensate for a projected loss of $77 million in federal
funds next year, Adams envisioned cancellation of museum programs,
drastically shorter museum hours and widespread job layoffs.

   Voters narrowly approved a $50 million
bond issue to renovate and expand the aging Kansas City Zoo.
   With all precincts reporting, the issue had 37,514 yes votes, or
58.4 percent, and 26,517 no votes, or 41 percent. It needed 57
percent of the vote to pass.
   The money will be used to more than double the size of the
80-acre zoo on the city's east side, and increase the number of
species from 168 to 263.
   The plan also calls for new African and Australian exhibits that
allow species to interact as they do in the wild.
   Supporters said renovation would boost slumping attendance and
assure better care for animals at the 81-year-old zoo.
   Opponents said the city should focus on more pressing problems,
such as drugs, crime and homelessness.
   They also said it was the wrong time to add to Kansas City tax
bills. The bond issue will add an estimated $10 a year to the
average homeowner's property tax.
   Residents of the school district already face a likely 24
property tax hike for teacher salaries, approved by a federal judge
and awaiting school board acion.

   Bert Parks says he may take up Miss
America Pageant officials on their offer to return. But he won't do
it for a song.
   Parks serenaded the newly crowned beauty queen with ``There She
Is'' for 25 years before he was fired as emcee in 1980 to give the
show a younger look.
   The pageant director who dumped him, Albert Marks, died last
year. Marks' successor, Leonard Horn, wants to bring back Parks for
the pageant's 75th anniversary this year. The pageant will be held
Sept. 4-8 and shown on NBC.
   Parks, 75, said Tuesday that terms of his return are still being
worked out.
   Horn said Gary Collins and Phyllis George will be hosts this
year for the second time.
   Parks wasn't thrilled about that news.
   ``I don't want to appear in something fourth-fiddle,'' he said.
And he said he will not appear merely to sing the traditional song.
   ``If it's just that, we ain't doing nothing,'' Parks said.

on her husband's recordings.
   The lawsuit filed Friday says CBS Records underreports and
underpays royalties to entertainers.
   A CBS Records receptionist Tuesday said lawyers had no comment
on the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit demands return of an estimated 50 to 100 master
recordings, including the soundtracks to such Astaire films as
``Easter Parade,'' said Thomas White, an industry consultant who
manages the Astaire music assets.
   Astaire albums sell hundreds of thousands of copies a year
worldwide, White said.
   He said CBS Records' license to distribute the records has been
terminated.
   Astaire died in 1987.

<HEAD>Cool August Weather Concerns Corn, Soybean Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cool weather in August is concerning many
farmers whose late-planted corn and soybeans might run into an
early frost in a few weeks.
   That would reduce grain yields and put a crimp into Agriculture
Department predictions of bumper harvests this fall and a generally
rosy outlook for the coming year.
   But it's premature to make such dire weather predictions, says
USDA meteorologist Jeffrey A. Andresen. Farmers, bankers and grain
traders will have to sweat a while longer.
   ``Based on normal weather, I would think the odds and statistics
would favor the crop maturing normally and not having any
problems,'' Andresen said.
   The USDA will issue its first survey-based estimate of 1990
production of corn, soybeans and other fall-harvested crops on
Thursday. Those estimates will be updated again in September,
October and November.
   Heavy rains kept farmers out of their fields over much of the
country last spring, delaying planting and reducing the chance for
optimum yields. But the growing season has been a dandy, for the
most part, and now the worry is about early freezes in the northern
areas.
   A weekly weather and crop report on Tuesday showed corn
development still running far behind normal in much of the main
production areas.
   In Iowa, for example, 85 percent of the corn was in the silking
stage, compared with a normal development of 98 percent. Illinois
was even more behind at 79 percent, compared with 100 percent
usually by now.
   Andresen said in a telephone interview Tuesday that he knows of
``no precursor to help predict an early frost.'' Most, he said, are
``micro-climatic phenomena'' that happen only occasionally on a
significant scale.
   The last time an early frost did major economic damage was in
1974, when freezing weather ``clipped some of the corn and
soybeans,'' Andresen said.
   On the other hand, farmers in 1984 had a very late spring and
crops were planted well into June, he said. Those crops went on to
mature for the fall harvest.
   The threat of frost begins in the Corn Belt ``sometime in the
first couple of weeks of September,'' he said. That early area
would include southern Minnesota and parts of northern Iowa.
   ``But most of the major part of the Corn Belt does not
experience the first 32-degree Fahrenheit weather until sometime in
early October,'' Andresen said.
   The recent below-normal temperatures have been ``fantastic as
far as pollination and silking'' of corn is concerned, he said. But
some warmer weather would be welcome now for development ``to speed
it up a bit.''
   Andresen added: ``We're just going to have to keep our finger
crossed, but I would say again the statistics and the odds still do
favor a normal completion of the season.''

   Soybeans might be more attractive as human
food if a world standard for protein nutritional quality is
adopted, according to Agriculture Department officials.
   A new method of measuring food proteins was proposed by the
department's Agricultural Research Service and Canada's Food
Directorate, said William H. Tallent, assistant administrator of
the research agency.
   The U.S.-Canada proposal and evaluation were made for the Food
and Agriculture Organization, an agency of the United Nations. An
FAO committee is recommending that countries adopt the new method.
   ``With the current method based on nutritional needs of rats
rather than humans, soy protein ranks only about two-thirds as high
as animal protein,'' Tallent said Tuesday. ``The new method is
simpler, cheaper and more meaningful because it's based on human
needs.''
   Tallent is U.S. delegate to the vegetable protein committee,
part of the Codex Alimentarius Commission that sets food standards
for the FAO.
   Retired food technologist Frank McDonough, who organized much of
the international testing of the method's reliability, said the new
method could help the image of vegetable protein, particularly U.S.
soybean products.
   ``Soy protein scores higher for nutritional quality under the
new standard, and the United States produces most of the soy
protein in world markets,'' McDonough said.

   Apple juice is gaining favor in Japan, says an
Agriculture Department trade report.
   ``This increasing thirst is expected to grow at an annual rate
of more than 10 percent for the next several years from the 1989
level of 54,000 metric tons as consumers switch to high-quality
fruit juices the report said.
   Until recently, it added, juice consumption was limited to
``relatively poor quality fruit beverages'' because of strict
government controls on fruit juice. That limited the supply of 100
percent fruit juice.
   ``But supplies are improving due to expansion of import quotas
and Japanese liberalization of apple, grape and pineapple imports
on April 1, 1990,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   One man's ping-pong balls are the Navy's
``model baby turtles.''
   The Navy plans to float ping-pong balls this week from the
hatching grounds of threatened turtles near the Dry Tortugas to
determine whether hatchlings might drift into an explosives testing
zone.
   Navy officials said they will delay tests of 1,200-pound
explosives 15 miles from the island chain until they feel confident
the babies won't be hurt.
   ``If they (the balls) drift into the area, we'll have a
problem,'' said Dan Probert, head of the Navy's ordnance testing
program in Key West.
   The weapons research is aimed at helping produce new systems for
submarines.
   Richie Moretti, who runs the Hidden Harbor Environmental
Project, called the ping-pong ball exercise ludicrous. He said
Monday the Navy should hold off on explosives testing until after
the August-to-October turtle hatching season.
   ``Mother Nature provided them with a shell, but not one that can
withstand a blast,'' Moretti said.
   Michael Eng, the National Park Service superintendent for the
Fort Jefferson National Monument on Dry Tortugas, said his staff
counted 40 turtle nests on the Tortugas islands. Each nest contains
100 to 120 eggs.

   A fire Monday gutted the gas station and restaurant owned by

   The three frogs, posed dancing on their hind legs, were the

The third just dances along.
   The truck stop near Hillsboro, about 55 miles southeast of

   Oklahoma is preparing for its first

   Up to 40 prison officials will take part next week in the mock
execution at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.
   ``We will role-play the entire process and video it,'' said
Warden James Saffle. ``We want to make sure we are maintaining
professionalism and the dignity of the inmate.''
   The last person executed in Oklahoma was James French, who died
in the electric chair in 1966.
   Charles Troy Coleman has been sentenced to die by injection
Sept. 10 for the 1979 shotgun slaying of John Seward, 68, of
Muskogee. Seward and his wife, Roxie, were killed after they
apparently surprised a burglar.
   In 1987, Coleman came within 36 hours of execution before he
received a stay.

   Good title: ``Good Vibes.''
   It describes precisely the first composition commissioned by
Classical Jazz at Lincoln Center as conducted Tuesday by its
creator, Benny Carter, the night before his 83rd birthday.
   ``Good vibes'' is what the audience felt for 35 minutes, the
vibraphone the solo instrument. Each of the six movements was a
delight musically and, somehow, set the mood of an enjoyable social
occasion.
   Carter led a 17-piece band, sometimes playing his saxophone. He
wrote for unusual instrumentation, putting the spotlight on two
vibraphones. His soloists for the premiere were Bobby Hutcherson
and Milt Jackson.
   They are splendid players and so was the band. Carter has
written for a melodic swing band, like Fletcher Henderson or Count
Basie, more than the driving big band style of Buddy Rich, Woody
Herman or Stan Kenton.
   Hutcherson, who was inspired to play vibraphone by hearing a
record by Jackson, makes a dashing attack on the instrument. His
notes are clean and clear and heard individually. Jackson is more
subtle, playing smooth phrases.
   But Carter didn't always compose to those leanings. He gave
Hutcherson the solo in the movement titled ``Ballad for Bobby''
which had some melancholy and lovely chords and turned romantic.
And Jackson was given some fast, urgent passages.
   It was marvelous to hear both vibraphonists play enough to get a
rounded sense of their abilities.
   The first half of the concert in Alice Tully Hall had pianist
James Williams, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Billy Higgins.
Hutcherson played with them on a tune which went from slow to fast
to mellow, a pretty ballad and a jump-right-in number. Jackson then
played with them on ``If I Were a Bell,'' ``Willow Weep for Me''
and a flowing, elegant riff.
   Before presenting his ``Good Vibes,'' Carter led the big band in
a few of the songs he has written, ``Vine Street Rumble,'' ``Sao
Paulo,'' ``The South Side Samba'' and the lovely ``Evening Star,''
which he said he titled ``Blue Star'' until he wrote lyrics for it
and needed an additional syllable.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: America's Three Best Friends Stand to Gain _ If
Iraq Pulls Back</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If _ and at this point it's a big optimistic
if _ U.S. and world pressure forces Iraq's Saddam Hussein to pull
back from Kuwait, three of America's best friends in the Middle
East stand to gain new stature.
   The three are Egypt, which has stood virtually alone in the Arab
world alongside the United States; Jordan, which ironically stood
apart; and Israel, which has sounded warnings about Baghdad that
until now were considered exaggerated.
   Saddam's drive into Kuwait shocked the Bush administration into
a starker perception of the Iraqi leader than policymakers were
willing to consider only a few weeks ago. Sanctions urged by
Congress were sidestepped then as too harsh, although consideration
was given to restoring Iraq to the State Department's list of
countries that support terrorism.
   Now, with Kuwait in the hands of an invading Iraqi force and
U.S. troops preparing to defend Saudi Arabia's oil fields, the
United States seems poised to take Saddam on _ preferably through
an economic blockade backed by an international armada.
   In pursuit of this strategy, President Bush sent Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney on the road to persuade the Saudis their oil
fields must be secured and then to Egypt to stake out bases there.
Today, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was flying to Turkey
and then to Brussels on Friday where the 16 NATO countries will
develop a blockade strategy.
   Historically, the sense of brotherhood that permeates the Arab
world makes it difficult for outside powers like the United States
to gain overt support from one country against another.
   That makes Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's decision to line
up with Washington against Saddam's invasion of Kuwait all the more
remarkable.
   Egypt, by virtue of being the only Arab country to sign a peace
treaty with Israel, already is held in special regard by the U.S.
administration.
   Mubarak also is the key U.S. conduit to the Palestine Liberation
Organization in Baker's so far unsuccessful attempt to set up
negotiations between Israel and Palestinian Arabs.
   Cairo receives nearly $3 billion in annual assistance from the
United States. Any reasonable request for additional economic or
military help is apt to get a sympathetic hearing at the White
House and on Capitol Hill.
   If Iraq submits to pressure and withdraws, Jordan also will
benefit, but under very different circumstances.
   Unlike Mubarak, the Jordanian monarch, King Hussein, did not
rally to the U.S. banner. In fact, he disputed the Bush
administration's assessment of the Iraqi leader.
   On Saturday, as Iraqi troops solidified their hold on Kuwait,
the king said it was premature for Arab countries to condemn the
invasion. Hussein called the Iraqi leader a patriotic man.
   Whatever motivated the king to defer to his more powerful
neighbor, Jordan offers safe passageway from Iraq, and 78 tourists,
most of them Japanese, exited that way on Monday. And if under
increasing pressure Saddam elects to seek a diplomatic compromise,
he might well ask Jordan to play a middleman role.
   The third biggest gainer could be Israel, which understandably
is maintaining a low profile as the United States marshals the
forces to stop Saddam.
   Nine years ago, Israel destroyed Iraq's only nuclear facility in
what Jerusalem described as a pre-emptive strike. In today's Middle
East, the Israelis worry just as much about Iraqi missiles and
chemical weapons.
   But they may not be inclined to take the same political and
diplomatic risk they chanced in June 1981 by leveling the Osirak
reactor near Baghdad. Nor may Israel have to.
   The United States, with infinitely more prestige than the small
Jewish state could ever hope to muster, is leading a world campaign
against the Iraqi leader.
   Saddam's invasion of Kuwait could backfire against him in any
number of ways, all of them enhancing Israel's security.
   Forcing him to withdraw would clip his wings. Although officials
are reluctant to discuss hypothetical situations, a military
collision with Iraq conceivably could lead to his ouster _ and a
drastic change in the security situation in the Middle East.

<HEAD>NASA Plans to Resume Shuttle Flights Next Month, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA plans to roll Columbia back to the launch
pad late this week and prepare the space shuttle for an early
September liftoff that will put Americans back in orbit for the
first time since April.
   At a news conference Tuesday, NASA Associate Administrator
William Lenoir said the agency is so confident about the repair of
a hydrogen leak on Columbia that it has canceled plans to make an
additional test for the leak.
   ``We're back on track and more or less are in our normal
operating scheme,'' Lenoir told reporters.
   He said a new plumbing connection, called an umbilical, has been
placed on Columbia and engineers believe this has eliminated the
hydrogen leak.
   Meanwhile, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope
said Tuesday they are getting closer to a complete description of
the focusing flaw that has crippled the $1.5 billion spacecraft.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not
launched a space shuttle since April. Launch attempts of Columbia
and of Atlantis were scrubbed after hydrogen leaks were discovered
on the craft. The leaks forced the agency to ground the shuttle
fleet until engineers found the source of the leaking hydrogen and
corrected the problem.
   Lenoir said tests of Columbia's leaky umbilical determined that
hydrogen was escaping from seals near two valves. The flawed
umbilical was replaced with new hardware from Endeavour, a space
shuttle now being built.
   Tests showed that the leak on Atlantis was not in the valve
seals, but in another place in the maze of pipes that carry liquid
hydrogen, Lenoir said. This means, he said, that the leaks were
from two separate problems and did not indicate a design or
manufacturing weakness in the shuttle system.
   Atlantis, still on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida, will be rolled back to the hangar for repairs late this
week. Columbia will take its place on the launch pad and be
prepared for a liftoff on Sept. 4 or 5, Lenoir said.
   NASA earlier had announced plans to test Columbia for leaks by
pumping liquid hydrogen into the shuttle's fuel tank. A similar
test on Atlantis led to discovery of its leak in June.
   But Lenoir said Columbia now will be tested for leaks only as
the shuttle is being fueled for launch. He said that even if a
special test detected a leak in Columbia, it could not be fixed in
time for a mission in September.
   NASA engineers have to spend much of September preparing for the
Oct. 5 launch of space shuttle Discovery and its payload, the
Ulysses space probe.
   The Ulysses, which is destined to go into a polar orbit of the
sun, can only be launched during a planetary alignment of the Earth
and Jupiter that occurs once every 13 months.
   The purpose of Columbia's mission is to carry into orbit an
array of astronomy instruments. A seven-man crew will use the
instruments to study the stars during a nine-day flight.
   Atlantis had been scheduled to fly a secret military mission.
That flight has yet to be rescheduled. The current schedule calls
for Atlantis to fly a science mission in November and for Columbia
to fly a space laboratory mission in December.
   Regarding the Hubble problem, mission scientist Ed Weiler said
NASA engineers expect by Labor Day to understand enough about the
focusing problem to start the grinding of eight corrective lens for
a replacement camera now being built.
   An instrument, called the wide field planetary camera, will be
installed in the Hubble during a space shuttle flight in 1993.
Corrective optics in the camera will compensate for the flawed
focus in the primary mirror of the telescope.
   Weiler said scientists are taking a series of pictures with the
camera now on board Hubble and that by analyzing these pictures,
experts should be able to draw up a prescription for the corrective
optics on the new camera.
   He said with this schedule, the replacement camera could be
ready in time for a space shuttle repair mission to the orbiting
Hubble by January 1993.

   Numbed by terror and loss, Kuwaiti
refugees are telling of desperate attempts to escape the Iraqi
assault wave and of invaders killing people who tried to stop them
from entering private homes.
   But the refugees appear to be finding some solace in the
generosity shown by leaders of neighboring Persian Gulf states.
   One refugee, 7-year-old Fahd, said Iraqi soldiers had forced
their way into his family's Kuwait city home and made them turn
over everything they owned.
   Ghanem al-Asimi, who worked at Kuwait International Airport,
described how Iraqi troops were ``beating up people, stealing cars
and forcing drivers to stop, shooting them if they disobeyed.''
   Asimi and others Kuwaitis spoke Tuesday in the cafeteria of a
hotel in Bahrain, to which they had fled after Thursday's invasion.
   ``Everybody was hysterical,'' he said. ``We kept getting calls
from friends saying that a few families who tried to stop Iraqis
from entering their homes were shot dead.''
   The bulk of refugees who made it out were those who fled south
on the first and second days of the invasion, before the Iraqis
stretched their forces along the borders. More recent arrivals
slipped through the desert.
   In Dubai, the capital of the neighboring United Arab Emirates, a
number of Europeans said Tuesday that they had sneaked across the
Kuwaiti desert to safety, pushed by a general desperation and a
fear of food shortages in Kuwait.
   Jeremy Upton, a 28-year-old Briton, said Iraqi artillery hitting
targets in Kuwait city persuaded him he ``had to go for it fast.
   ``I was looking north to the city, and about 15 miles away saw
the shells hitting,'' he said. ``It was probably the palace and
that really brought it home.''
   Upton, a shipping company employee, grabbed his 2-year-old
daughter, Hannah, and his Kuwaiti wife, Ashmahan al-Abdul Hadi and
fled.
   Leaving behind all personal belongings, they jumped into a small
jeep and drove 840 miles to Saudi Arabia and on to Dubai on the
southern Persian Gulf.
   Helena Von Schantz, a 31-year-old Stockholm native, and her
electronics engineer husband Mikael Wiberg fled by car with their
daughter and son and a German technician.
   They left Kuwait shortly after sunrise Sunday, driving to
Bahrain from Abu Halifa, a southern suburb of Kuwait City.
   ``It was safer to risk our lives this way than remain behind,''
said Mrs. Von Schantz said. ``Food supplies were beginning to run
out in Kuwait.''
   ``The soldiers in our area seemed almost apologetic and
uncomfortable about having invaded Kuwait. But soldiers near the
border were different, exuding a feeling of power,'' she said.
   The Kuwaitis and other nationals who escaped their occupied
oil-rich kingdom have been greeted warmly bytheir southern
neighbors.
   In the United Arab Emirates, the government is paying the hotel
bill of 800 Kuwaitis who arrived there. Each was given more than
$500 on arrival.
   Kuwait had a population of some 1.8 million, of which more than
60 percent were foreigners. When the invasion was launched, about
half the population was reportedly out of the country, escaping the
gulf's burning summer.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd has issued orders to consider all
Kuwaitis guests of the kingdom, according to official sources
reached by telephone from Bahrain. Saudi banks were ordered Tuesday
to purchase Kuwaiti dinars from cash-starved Kuwaitis at a higher
rate than the plummeting market value after the Iraqi invasion.
   In addition, Kuwait Airways has started operating out of the
eastern Saudi city of Dhahran.
   The sources estimated the number of refugees from Kuwait now
inside the kingdom at about 40,000. They include the emir, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who was spirited to Saudi Arabia in the
first hours of the invasion.
   The emir has apparently taken up residence in an opulent palace.

<HEAD>Vice President Conferring With Peruvian Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle was discussing drug
control and economic development today with the new president of
Peru, a country the Bush administration considers laggard in the
drive against cocaine.
   President Alberto Fujimori, who took office only 11 days ago, is
looking for development aid as he tries to repair a collapsing
economy.
   But Quayle's message was expected to be that without strong
anti-drug measures by Peru, Congress won't approve the kind of aid
the country needs.
   It was the second stop on Quayle's mission to the three nations
that joined the United States at the Cartagena, Colombia, drug
summit last Feb. 15. In Bogota, Colombia, on Tuesday, the vice
president said the campaign against illegal drugs is ``a common
fight _ it is a partnership.''
   Quayle went to Bogota for the inauguration of Colombian
President Cesar Gaviria, and said his visit symbolized the U.S.
commitment to work with that government against drugs and for
expanded trade and development there.
   He told Gaviria that talks the Colombians seek to implement a
new trade agreement between the two countries will open by the
first week in September.
   In his inaugural address, as Quayle sat among visiting leaders,
Gaviria emphasized that drug-consuming countries must reduce their
demand for cocaine, because the cocaine-producing nations cannot
solve the problem otherwise.
   Fujimori has made that point, too.
   Quayle also was meeting in Lima with 11 Peruvian business
leaders. The topic, again, was economic development for an economy
in which inflation has rocketed to over 3,000 percent a year.
   The vice president was attending a luncheon with Peruvian
officials before heading on to La Paz, Bolivia.
   While Quayle aides said Congress would be the problem in a bid
for new aid without tough drug measures, the administration's own
Office of National Drug Control Policy put it even more sharply in
a paper on the Andean drug strategy.
   That account, distributed aboard Quayle's Air Force jet, said
the United States is monitoring and evaluating drug-fighting
efforts to see whether they ``justify the provision'' of additional
aid next year.
   The drug policy office said the situation in Peru ``is the most
problematic'' among the three Andean countries.
   ``Peruvians commonly perceive the economy and the insurgency as
bigger national issues than narcotics,'' the paper said. ``To date,
Peru has demonstrated limited effectiveness in curtailing its
cocaine industry and its national will to do so remains to be
demonstrated.''
   The drug policy office said the Andean strategy is designed to
``assist Peru by strengthening its institutional will and
capability to take action against the cocaine industry.''
   Quayle is to meet tonight in La Paz with Bolivian President
Jaime Paz Zamora. After a final round of meeting in Bolivia on
Thursday, he flies to Haiti and then returns to Washington.

   Marlon Brando's son pleaded innocent
to murdering his sister's lover and remained behind bars on $10
million bail.
   Defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro said he will ask for a
reduction in 32-year-old Christian Brando's bail, arguing that an
everyday defendant in such a case would be held on $50,000 to
$100,000.
   ``We are going to ask that Christian not be singled out and
treated differently than anyone else would be in a similar
situation,'' Shapiro said.
   He said he may propose at a hearing Thursday that the actor's
son be released with an electronic monitoring device on his ankle
or wrist.
   Christian Brando pleaded innocent to murder and possession of a
machine gun in the slaying of Dag Drollet, the 26-year-old Tahitian
lover of his half-sister, Cheyenne Brando, in an argument May 16 at
the elder Brando's estate.
   Marlon Brando did not attend Tuesday's hearing.
   Prosecutors argued previously for no bail, saying the defendant
might flee the country.
   Two weeks ago, a judge set $10 million as the price for Brando's
freedom, taking into consideration his father's vast wealth.
Authorities said that was believed to be the highest bail ever set
in Los Angeles County.
   Miss Brando, 20, recently went to Tahiti. Authorities say she is
unwilling to return to testify at her brother's trial.
   Police who arrived at the Brando home in the Santa Monica
Mountains said young Brando told them he shot Drollet accidentally
``because he hurt my sister. My sister is pregnant.'' Miss Brando
gave birth June 30 in Tahiti.

   Hitting Baghdad where it hurts, more countries have
joined a U.N.-sanctioned boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   On Tuesday, countries ranging from powerful Japan to neutral
Switzerland to tiny Cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort
to convince the Baghdad government to withdraw its troops that
invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
   Turkey announced it was shut down the twin Iraqi oil pipelines
that run through it to the Mediterranean _ carrying half of
Baghdad's crude output _ and cutting off trade with Iraq.
   Baghdad's only other major pipelines exporting crude run through
Saudi Arabia, where the flow has been drastically reduced.
   The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted to impose broad
economic sanctions against Iraq for invading small oil-rich Kuwait.
The measure forbids loans to Iraq or Kuwait and prohibits any
activities, including the transfer of money, that would help the
two countries export their goods.
   Sanctions adopted by the European Economic Community on Saturday
froze Iraqi assets and suspended the purchase of oil from the two
Arab countries. More than 90 percent of imports from Iraq to the
12-nation EEC are petroleum products. The EEC also suspended arms
sales to Iraq.
   Switzerland, which is not a member of the United Nations, made
the unusual move Tuesday of joining the U.N. sanctions and banned
all trade with Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. In addition,
Switzerland prohibited all payments and other financial transfers
to Iraq and Kuwait.
   Denmark, Norway and Sweden also announced embargoes on all trade
with both countries.
   Japan's participation in the U.N. sanctions was seen as
especially key since Tokyo usually has taken a low profile in the
Middle East, which supplies much of its petroleum needs. Japan
imports 99 percent of its oil.
   China joined the U.N. decision to embargo arms sales to Iraq,
but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning
the invasion. China sold arms to both Iran and Iraq during their
eight-year war and is a major Iraqi trade partner.
   Cyprus' sacrifice in joining the embargo was to give up 70
percent of its oil imports, government spokesman Akis Fantis said.
Cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of August,
he said, but ``we are already in the process of taking steps to
secure alternative sources ...''
   The worldwide closing of ranks against Iraqi oil imports is
likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices, which have already
risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact
on the world economy.
   Wholesale oil prices soared to five-year highs in New York on
Monday.
   France will introduce controls Thursday on prices of petroleum
products to prevent refiners from using Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
as an excuse to raise prices, acting Premier Pierre Beregovoy
announced Tuesday.
   An official with the Petroleum Association of Japan said he was
unaware of any increase yet in the price of gasoline for consumers.
The official, who refused to be further identified, said it would
be at least three months before the sanctions could be expected to
force higher gas prices in Japan.

   An anti-war demonstrator whose legs were
severed by a Navy munitions train has agreed to settle his lawsuit
against the government and train crew for $920,000, his lawyer says.
   The settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. Justice
Department, said attorney Thomas Steel.
   Brian Willson, 49, had sued for personal injuries and civil
rights violations after his legs were cut off below the knee as he
sat on the tracks outside the Concord Naval Weapons Station in
1987. He and others were protesting against U.S. weapons shipments
to Central America.
   ``I hope this settlement at least means that the government
can't use lethal force to stop demonstrators,'' Willson said in
today's San Francisco Chronicle.
   Lawyers for the defendants _ the U.S. government, the
three-member train crew and two supervisors at the Concord base _
agreed to the settlement, Steel said. The lawsuit had been set for
trial Sept. 10 in federal court.
   Steel said that under the agreement, none of the defendants
admitted any wrongdoing.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Penrose, who represented the
government, said he was barred by a confidentiality order from
commenting on the settlement.
   Willson sued in 1988 after the train crew filed a complaint
seeking damages for emotional distress they said he intended to
inflict on them by letting them run over him. Their lawsuit was
dismissed earlier this year.
   Willson's lawsuit claimed the Navy had been notified about plans
to block the train and that the crew could see him far down the
tracks and had time to stop the train before running into him at 17
mph, more than three times the posted 5 mph limit.
   The Navy accused Willson of causing his own injuries.

<HEAD>Young Fails in Georgia Bid; Hayden Survives Kansas Scare</HEAD>

   Andrew Young came up short in his bid to make history as
Georgia's first black governor, falling to Lt. Gov. Zell Miller in
a Democratic runoff. Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden survived a scare,
edging a Republican primary opponent who blamed him for higher
property taxes.
   ``Don't say that I didn't run a good campaign,'' Young, the
former Atlanta mayor, congressman and U.N. ambassador, said Tuesday
night. ``Say that Zell Miller ran a better campaign.''
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Miller had 576,226
votes, or 62 percent. Young had 352,159 votes, or 38 percent.
   The loser called for party unity and termed Miller his ``former
opponent, but my friend.''
   ``Zell Miller is a people-person whom the people of Georgia feel
comfortable with,'' Young said. ``They know Zell Miller better than
they know Andy Young.''
   Young, 58, had hoped to follow in the footsteps of L. Douglas
Wilder of Virginia, who last November became the nation's first
black elected governor.
   He finished 12 points behind Miller in the primary July 17 after
a genteel campaign in which race was rarely mentioned. For the
runoff, Young went on the offensive, attacking Miller's ties to the
banking industry and resurrecting the label ``Zig-Zag Zell'' that
was hung on Miller 10 years ago to suggest he changed positions for
political expediency.
   ``Now is the time for reconciliation,'' Miller, 58, said in
claiming victory. ``The last two weeks I did not see the Andy Young
I had known for the last 20 years. But I also can empathize with
him. I've been behind. I've lashed out. I understand that feeling.''
   Miller, whose main issue was support for a state lottery, faces
Republican Johnny Isakson in November. Democratic Gov. Joe Frank
Harris was barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term.
   In Kansas, Hayden narrowly defeated real estate executive Nestor
Weigand Jr., the strongest of five primary challengers. In an upset
on the Democratic side, state Treasurer Joan Finney wrecked former
Gov. John Carlin's hopes of a comeback.
   With all precincts reporting, Hayden had 138,025 votes, or 45
percent, Weigand had 130,358 votes, or 42 percent, and four others
divided the remainder.
   Hayden and other Republicans were surprised by Mrs. Finney's
victory.
   ``We certainly don't take her lightly,'' Hayden said. ``I look
forward to an aggressive, very straightforward campaign on the
issues.''
   Weigand, a 51-year-old businessman with no political experience,
spent his own money freely in a 10-week TV blitz. He hit hard at
the 46-year-old governor's role in property reappraisal and a new
classification system that many blamed for big property tax
increases in 1989.
   ``You all have given me more than any candidate could ever
expect,'' Weigand told supporters. ``We've come a long way in the
last 11 weeks. And we've left an indelible mark on Kansas.''
   On the Democratic side, Finney had 80,831 votes, or 47 percent;
Carlin had 79,115 votes, or 46 percent; and minister Fred Phelps
had 11,612 votes, or 7 percent.
   ``I have no regrets over the decision I made (to try a comeback)
last October, and I have no regrets over the race I ran,'' Carlin
said.
   Mrs. Finney said she attributed her victory to ``a desire by the
people to regain control of their government, and have some fiscal
responsibility.''
   The longtime treasurer ran a shoestring campaign, raising only
about $50,000, and few political observers gave her any chance. She
received no major newspaper endorsements.
   Carlin's private life may have cost him votes. He divorced twice
while he served as governor from 1979 to 1987, and his second wife
drew unfavorable attention by trying to raise money for a swimming
pool at the executive mansion while the Kansas economy was in
trouble.
   Here are highlights of other voting Tuesday:
   MICHIGAN: Republicans picked state Sen. John Engler to challenge
Gov. James Blanchard and Rep. Bill Schuette to take on Sen. Carl
Levin. Both incumbent Democrats seek third terms. Engler won 87
percent of the vote against General Motors engineer John Lauve,
while Schuette defeated lawyer Clark Durant 62 percent to 38
percent.
   MISSOURI: Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader,
easily captured the Democratic nomination for an eighth term,
claiming 82 percent of the vote against Nicholas F. Clement, a
newspaper carrier who is a follower of extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   KANSAS: Sen. Nancy Kassebaum had no trouble gaining the GOP
nomination for a third term, piling up 87 percent of the vote
against political unknown Gregory Walstrom. The victor in the
Democratic Senate primary was former Rep. Bill Roy, who tried too
late to remove his name from the ballot and still outpolled
political newcomer Dick Williams of Wichita 57 percent to 43
percent.

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has put Turkey in
a delicate spot, testing both its allegiance to NATO and the West
and its commitment to friendly ties with its volatile Arab and
Moslem neighbors.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III arrives Thursday, and
there is speculation the United States wants to enlist Turkey's
military against Iraq.
   Turkey, which considers itself a bridge between Europe and Asia,
has been feeling the pull of both East and West more than ever as
it tries to take a balanced position in the aftermath of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Turkey doesn't want to isolate itself from the United States and
Western Europe by refusing to take strong punitive action against
neighboring Iraq.
   It is hoping for admission to the European Community, which has
taken a tough line against Iraq. But predominately Moslem Turkey
also fears provoking the wrath of Iraq and angering Moslem
fundamentalists who value Arab solidarity.
   The dilemma was most evident in the way Ankara dealt with the
twin pipelines that carry Iraqi oil through Turkey to a terminal on
the Mediterranean coast.
   Turkey came under immediate pressure from the United States to
shut down the pipelines, but Turkey refused to act unilaterally.
Before long, Iraq shut down one of the pipelines itself and reduced
the capacity of the second.
   Then, on Tuesday, the second pipeline was effectively shut down
when Turkey announced it was banning tankers from loading oil from
it. But Turkish officials were quick to stress that the decision
was taken strictly in line with the oil embargo ordered by the U.N.
Security Council on Monday.
   ``We were not pressured by anyone,'' said the state minister for
oil affairs, Mehmet Kececiler.
   Western diplomatic sources said Turkey stood the most to lose of
any NATO country from sanctions against Iraq. Iraq owes Turkey
about $740 million, debts which were to be paid off with oil
purchases. Turkey was being paid more than $250 million a year to
service the pipelines.
   Now that the United States has intervened militarily in the
crisis, Turkey may face tough decisions. The United States would
need permission from the Turkish government to use bases on Turkish
soil for any operations in the Persian Gulf.
   U.S. officials in Washington said Tuesday that a multinational
force including Egyptians and Morrocans will be deployed in Saudi
Arabia to deter an Iraqi attack.
   Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Murat Sungar said early today
that Turkey had not received any request to join such a force.
   There has been speculation that Baker will raise military
options when he arrives for talks with President Turgut Ozal and
other officials. Western diplomatic sources said, however, that
Baker is coming for ``broad consultations on overall strategy'' and
not on a military mission.
   The Turkish media has speculated about the presence of 14 U.S.
F-111 figher-bombers at the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey.
   The same type of aircraft, taking off from bases in Britain,
were used in the 1986 U.S. bombing raids against Libya.
   The U.S. Embassy and the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the
planes are on a routine rotation in Turkey.
   While Turkey suddenly finds itself in a prominent position in
the Persian Gulf equation, only recently the country was wondering
whether its long strategic role on NATO's southern flank was
evaporating with the end of the Cold War.
   A further sense of isolation from the West came when the
European Community indefinitely put off consideration of Turkey's
bid to join the trading bloc.

<HEAD>Justice Asks End of Antitrust Immunity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is calling for an end
to the immunity U.S. airlines have from antitrust laws in fixing
international air fares.
   The department's antitrust division made the recommendation
Tuesday in comments filed with the Transportation Department, which
is considering whether to extend the antitrust immunity for the
International Air Transport Association.
   IATA's members, who include American and foreign airlines, set
international air fares under an antitrust immunity that the
organization has enjoyed since 1946.
   The Federal Aviation Act allows the granting of such antitrust
exemptions to further ``international comity'' or other foreign
policy interests.
   the Justice Department urged the Transportation Department to
review the immunity on a country-by-country basis.
   ``Immunity for IATA appears particularly unwarranted in those
markets where the involved foreign government does not actively
support or favor cartel pricing,'' the Justice Department said,
noting that European Common Market nations are pushing for
increased airline competition.
   ``Many Americans may not realize that the prices of their
airline tickets for travel abroad are set by what is in effect a
legalized international cartel,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
said in a statement.
   Now that airline deregulation has promoted competition on
domestic flights, ``there is a strong interest in protecting
consumers when they travel on U.S. carriers from the United States
to foreign countries,'' said James F. Rill, assistant attorney
general for antitrust.

<TEXT>
   A 32-year-old meatpacker who blamed a
curse for the deaths of her six children and a niece has been
charged with killing three of her daughters to collect on their
life insurance.
   Diane Lumbrera was indicted Tuesday on three counts of murder.
   Five of Ms. Lumbrera's children died before their fourth
birthdays between 1976 and 1984, but the deaths did not arouse
suspicion at the time.
   Authorities in Texas began to investigate after Ms. Lumbrera was
charged with murder in Garden City, Kan., where she moved from
Bovina in 1985, in the smothering of her 4-year-old son in May.
   The Texas charges cover the deaths of 3-month-old Joanna
Lumbrera in 1976, 3-year-old Melissa Lumbrera in 1978 and
2-year-old Melinda Ann Garza in 1982.
   Prosecutors did not say how the three youngsters are alleged to
have been killed. Hospital and autopsy reports had given the cause
of death as choking in two cases and congenital heart disease in
the third.
   Bovina Police Chief Gary Coleman said Ms. Lumbrera told
authorities one of her former mothers-in-law put a curse on her
that damned all her children to early death.
   Sheriff's deputy Richard Bonham said he discovered Ms. Lumbrera
had attached to her life insurance policy riders for each of her
children and had collected a total of about $15,000 for their
deaths.
   Two other sons and a niece also died while under her care
between 1978 and 1984. Grand juries are looking into those deaths.
   After the Kansas death was questioned, authorities in Texas
began searching for details on the other deaths in and around
Bovina, a town of about 1,400 people 70 miles southwest of Amarillo.
   District Attorney Johnny Actkinson would not detail the evidence
against Ms. Lumbrera.

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound From Previous Losses, Dollar Slips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange sharply
rebounded Wednesday from the previous day's plunge and posted the
eighth-largest gain. The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended at 150.00 yen, down 0.60 yen from Tuesday's
finish. It opened higher at 150.63 yen, and ranged between 149.85
and 150.63.
   The Nikkei Stock Average recouped 856.07 points, or 3.10
percent, ending the day at 28,509.14.
   Wednesday's gain was the first since July 31 and the
eighth-largest ever, following a 901.75-point increase recorded
Nov. 13, 1987.
   The Nikkei's rebound was helped by index-linked bargain-hunting
in reaction to Tuesday's big drop, traders said.
   They said the index's rebound also reflected stability in bond
and currency markets.
   Masashi Wakabayashi, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., said
market players began to pick up underpriced issues following the
recent drops and adjusted their oversold positions.
   He said Wednesday's earlier gains in the futures market
encouraged investors buying in the spot market. He said, however,
very few people participated in the market.
   Other traders said stability in the bond market also contributed
to the Nikkei's gains Tuesday.
   Since last Thursday, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the index has
dropped 3,184.92 points, or 11.5 percent, topped by Tuesday's
946.46-point loss. The index's 27,653.07-point close Tuesday was
the lowest level since Oct. 26, 1988, when the index fell to
27,620.60.
   Already vulnerable due to higher interest rates, the index has
now lost 5,204.88 points since July 20 in 12 losses against one
gain in the last 13 trading days.
   The dollar inched downward against the yen after opening higher.
The yen strengthened against major European currencies as a result
of a technical correction, dealers said.
   They said the market is basically bearish toward the U.S. unit
but many market players are focusing less on the dollar as a safe
haven.
   In the bond market, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond slipped to 7.97 percent from Tuesday's
close of 8.105 percent. Its price rose to 83.56 points from 82.98
points.

   The Energy Department says the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve is ready for use if there is a severe energy
supply interruption, but that it won't be used just to keep prices
low.
   Congressional Democrats have asked President Bush to tap the
reserve now to stop the energy price rise the Iraqi invasion
started, but Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore says the reserve
will not be used to flood the market.
   However, John Easton, deputy assistant secretary of energy for
international affairs and energy emergencies, assured a House panel
Tuesday the agency is ready to use the reserve if necessary.
   The oil reserve was established in response to the 1973-74 Arab
oil embargo and built to its current size at a cost of about $20
billion, which includes the cost of the oil, and preparing and
maintaining the storage site. It has been tapped only once, when
Congress ordered 2 million barrels auctioned to oil companies in
1985.
   It would take at least 16 days from a presidential request for
oil to flow from the reserve, DOE spokesman Phil Keif said. During
that time, bids from oil companies would have to be submitted,
reviewed and chosen.

   Rep. Pete Stark has apologized to Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan for calling him a
``disgrace to his race'' last week, according to spokesmen for both
men.
   Neither Sullivan nor Stark's office would release the text of
the letter of apology delivered Monday night.
   ``He did apologize,'' Bob Shemermund, a spokesman for Sullivan,
said Tuesday.
   Stark's remark last week infuriated Sullivan, the only black
member of President Bush's Cabinet, who called the statement
``incomprehensibly offensive.''
   Stark, who said the intended target of his criticism was Bush
administration policies he believes harm blacks and the poor, said
on the House floor afterward, ``I blew it.''
   Sullivan did not take that as an apology.
   He did take the letter that way, but did not send a reply,
Schmermund said.
   In a speech Tuesday, Sullivan said ``he accepted the apology and
considered the incident closed,'' Schmermund said.
   Perry Plumart, a spokesman for Stark, refused to discuss the

<TEXT>
   The former chairman of a failed Texas savings
and loan association has been charged with embezzling more than $4
million after purchasing a controlling interest in the thrift in
1985.
   Alan Ross Rothery, a California attorney and former chairman of
Trinity Valley Savings and Loan Association of Cleveland, Texas,
was accused of bank fraud, embezzlement, self-dealing and giving
false information to a federal bank examiner.
   Each count carries a five-year sentence and a possible $250,000
fine.
   The indictment, returned Aug. 2 by a federal grand jury in
Beaumont, Texas, was unsealed in court Tuesday.
   It accuses Rothery and two California businessman, Errol
Coughlan, of Malibu, and John Coughlan Jr., of Long Beach, of
participating in a scheme to fraudulently divert loan proceeds.
   The Texas thrift was taken over by federal regulators in March
1989 and sold Oct. 6, 1989, to Hibernia National Bank in Texas,
regulators said. The loss to the government for insured deposits
and speculative loans is expected to reach $33 million, the Justice
Department said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Architect Gordon Bunshaft, whose austere,
modernist designs included glass and steel office towers in New
York and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, has died at age 81.
   Bunshaft, a retired partner at the firmi Skidmore, Owings &amp;
Merrill, died of cardiac arrest at his home on Monday.
   His designs included the Hirshhorn, the Lyndon Baines Johnson
Library in Austin, Texas, and his last and most elaborate project,
the National Commercial Bank in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, a triangular
building 27 stories high with no apparent front or back.
   His Lever House, built in 1952, introduced the sleek
International Style to New York's Park Avenue. The 24-story,
blue-green office tower was a marked contrast to the traditional
masonry buildings that lined the avenue.
   Bunshaft designed several other New York office towers,
including the Manufacturer's Hanover Trust building, the PepsiCo
building and the headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank, which
brought modernism to the financial district.
   A new generation of architects turned away from Bunshaft's
austere modernism.
   ``The architecture today would have nothing to do with what I
like doing,'' he said after his retirement in 1979. ``It's a
different world _ and I prefer mine.''
   He was awarded the Pritzker Prize for architecture in 1988 in
recognition of his early designs.
   He is survived by his wife, Nina. Funeral arrangements were not
disclosed.

   The first ``Roseanne'' episode since Roseanne
Barr screeched the national anthem finished in a tie for third
place in the ratings.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was No. 1 and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was second
for the week that ended Sunday, according to figures released
Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   With overall viewership hitting one of its lowest-ever levels,
the rerun of ``Roseanne'' was in a five-way tie for third place
with a 13.0 rating, compared with 14.6 for the July 31 show. About
1.4 million fewer households tuned in to ``Roseanne'' last week
than the previous week.
   ``Reruns don't matter,'' Miss Barr's husband, Tom Arnold, said
Tuesday. ``It's hard to gauge. It doesn't mean much.''
   Miss Barr screeched the national anthem at a San Diego Padres
baseball game July 25 and was pilloried for it.
   In the overall ratings, NBC was first with a 9.0, followed by
ABC with an 8.9 and CBS with 8.5. Each rating point represents
921,000 households.
   The audience interest in prime-time entertainment programs
dipped to a combined 50 share for the big three networks last week.
A share is the percentage of the TV sets in the country turned on
and tuned to a show.
   Preston Beckman, NBC research executive, said the share last
week was the lowest ever, except for weeks in which the national
political conventions were broadcast. He emphasized that it does
not represent a large, sudden decline.
   The three-network audience is down only two points for June and
July compared with the same months last year, he said.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings:
``Cheers,'' NBC, 14.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 13.3; (tie) ``America's
Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 13.0; (tie) ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 13.0;
(tie) ``Married ... With Children,'' Fox, 13.0; (tie) ``Roseanne,''
ABC, 13.0; (tie) ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC, 13.0; ``Designing
Women,'' CBS, 12.9; ``The Simpsons,'' Fox, 12.8; ``The CBS Tuesday
Movie _ Murder Ordained, Part 2,'' CBS, 12.7.
   In the network evening news ratings, ABC was first with 8.8,
followed by NBC with 7.8 and CBS with 7.7.

   In an inauguration ceremony ringed by
tight security, Cesar Gaviria became Colombia's youngest president
and called for more international help in fighting his country's
drug war.
   Helicopter gunships circled the city, anti-aircraft guns were
aimed at skies over the presidential palace where the inauguration
took place Tuesday and thousands of troops backed by armor
patrolled the streets.
   ``No country in the history of humanity has paid such a high
price as Colombia in confronting international crime,'' said
Gaviria, a demure 43-year-old economist and former treasury
minister.
   ``Drug trafficking is the main threat against our democracy. We
will fight it without concessions,'' said Gaviria, who took office
for a four-year term, succeeding President Virgilio Barco.
   The new president called on industrialized countries to lower
trade barriers to boost Colombian exports, which would give more
Colombians an alternative to participating in the drug trade.
   Gaviria was catapulted to his nation's highest office a year ago
when the then-leading presidential hopeful, Luis Carlos Galan of
the governing Liberal Party, was murdered by drug traffickers.
   That sparked a war between the government and powerful cocaine
lords that has left hundreds of people dead.
   Gaviria, who had served as Galan's campaign manager, became a
candidate after the assassination. During the campaigning for May's
elections, two other presidential candidates were also murdered. At
least one of the slayings was linked to drug lords.
   During Tuesday's ceremonies, Gaviria, his wife, two young
children and visiting presidents were seated behind bullet-proof
glass.
   Gaviria appealed to the United States, which consumes most of
the cocaine smuggled out of Colombia, to implement recently
announced policies that would favor his country's exports.
   ``It's not direct economic aid, or military assistance we need
most. It's fair treatment. It's free trade,'' Gaviria said.
   He called on developed countries to attack cocaine consumption
within their borders.
   Gaviria cautioned that extradition of suspected traffickers to
the United States _ the fate the drug lords here fear most _ cannot
be the only weapon or the main strategy in Colombia's fight against
the cocaine cartels.
   But he didn't rule out continued extraditions. In the last year
Colombia has extradited 22 trafficking suspects to the United
States and has 15 more waiting to be be extradited.
   The presidents of Venezuela, Argentina, Ecuador and Haiti
attended the ceremonies, which were held outdoors under rainy skies
alongside the presidential palace.
   Vice President Dan Quayle took the occassion to try to build
solidarity for world sanctions against Iraq's Saddam Hussein for
his invasion last week of Kuwait.
   ``Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait cannot stand, will not
stand,'' Quayle told a news conference in Bogota after meeting with
Gaviria.
   Quayle's security personnel took no chances with the vice
president's safety. Several of his muscular bodyguards, wearing
dark sunglasses, patrolled the Bogota airport and searched through
journalists' bags.
   Quayle flew from the airport to an army base in a helicopter
accompanied by four other Blackhawk helicopters armed with missiles.
   Despite an apparent cease-fire declared by Colombia's
billionaire drug traffickers last month, authorities did not
discount the possibility of terrorism.
   In the past year, drug traffickers have been blamed for
exploding some 300 bombs, killing about 500 people.
   In his remarks, Gaviria promised to further peace talks
currently under way with leftist guerrillas, open up the political
system to minority groups and promote social programs in Medellin,
Colombia's second largest city where much of the drug-related
violence takes place.
   The president's commitment to political pluralism appeared to be
confirmed by his choice of Cabinet ministers.
   The new Cabinet includes five members of opposition parties,
including M-19, a former leftist guerrilla group that signed a
peace treaty with the government in March.
   M-19's Antonio Navarro became the first former guerrilla to
occupy a Cabinet post in Colombia. He is the minister of health.
   Barco, who was prohibitied by the constitution from running
again, received international praise for launching the government's
war against drug traffickers. He will reportedly become Colombia's
next ambassador to Britain.

   At a glance, the latest developments involving Iraq and Kuwait:
   
   President Bush was addressing the nation today on the Middle
East crisis. Tuesday it became known he is sending combat troops
and jet fighters to Saudia Arabia to protect the kingdom from Iraqi
forces massed in Kuwait.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The administration continued to press for a full economic
boycott of Iraq. It asked the Saudis to shut off the flow of Iraqi
oil through its territory.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   More countries joined the U.N.-sanctioned boycott of oil from
Iraq and Kuwait. Among the latest are Japan, Denmark, Norway and
Sweden. Turkey shut down the Iraqis' vital oil outlet to the
Mediterranean.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein remained defiant despite the show
of force. He declared that the Iraqis ``would rather die than be
humiliated'' and threatened to ``pluck out the eyes of those who
attack the Arab nation.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Post is quoting intelligence sources as saying
Iraqi forces appeared to be loading poison gas munitions aboard
combat aircraft. Iraq has used chemical weapons during its
eight-year war with Iran and against its Kurdish minority.

   The American Automobile Association reports gasoline prices at
the pump are nearing five-year highs. It said Tuesday that
self-service unleaded rose 1.5 cents overnight to $1.201 per
gallon, the highest price since the last week of 1985. Based on a
survey of 1,400 stations nationwide, it said unleaded fuel has
increased 12.6 cents since last Wednesday, the day before Iraq
invaded Kuwait.

   Picnics, flashlight marches and
neighborhood visits from police marked this year's National Night
Out, a 7-year-old effort to get people more involved in preventing
crime.
   Around the country, people were urged to turn on their porch
lights and sit outside after dark Tuesday. New York Mayor David
Dinkins attended a rally in Harlem, and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
Police Chief Joe Gerwins went to 10 events.
   ``It's a sad time in the life of this city when little children
can't sleep in their parents' homes without risking death from a
bullet coming through the window,'' said Dinkins, referring to a
recent rash of child slayings in his city. ``It's a sad time, an
angry time, a time to come together and fight back.''
   Dinkins pledged $250,000 for neighborhood grants to provide
activities for young people and $950,000 more for community
crime-prevention programs, but spending a lot of public money
wasn't the theme of the evening.
   Night Out founder Matt Peskin said the cost of keeping a 60-watt
light in front and behind the average house at night is just $32 a
year but a big step toward getting a criminal or vandal to move on.
   When it started in 1984, the Night Out was mostly people sitting
in front of their homes with the lights on, but folks quickly began
to throw block parties and invited the police as a way to get to
know neighborhood officers.
   Barbara Landers held a party in Philadelphia.
   ``The block is running over with people,'' she said. ``We got to
introduce people to each other and let them know that there's
someone else out here networking with them.''
   Peskin had predicted a turnout of 21 million in 8,000
communities in all 50 states and Canada and at U.S. military bases
around the world. Participating groups have until the end of August
to report on turnout, he said.
   Elsewhere:
   _In Charleston, W.Va., at least 25 neighborhood groups held
rallies, cookouts, marches, block parties and other events. A
senior citizens group marched with flashlights around their
high-rise apartment complex.
   _In Columbus, Ohio, police coordinated activities of 194
community watches.
   _In Pittsburgh, hundreds of people blocked off streets for
potluck dinners, and children paraded down streets.
   _In Norfolk, Va., walkathons and flashlight vigils were held and
office buildings stayed lit into night. City vehicles kept their
lights on all day.

   A Colombian immigrant active in his homeland's
hard-on-drugs Liberal Party was shot to death in front of his home.
Police today would not say whether the attack was believed to be a
political assassination.
   Pedro Mendez, 50, was shot three times Monday night as he walked
from his car toward his home, police said. Mendez still had his
wallet and other valuables when police found him, said police
spokesman Fred Weiner.
   Mendez, who moved to this country 19 years ago, was treasurer of
the New York Chapter of the Colombian Liberal Party, which is
considered the leading opponent of Colombia's drug lords.
   The leader of the party, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, was inaugurated
president on Tuesday.
   ``It's possible the drug cartels killed him to assert their
power with the new president. Isn't it coincidental that (he) was
killed on the eve of Gaviria's inauguration?'' said Mendez's
brother Hector.
   Police spokeswoman Sgt. Tina Mohrmann would not comment on
whether the attack was believed to be politically motivated.
   Neighbors told police they heard gunshots and a car speeding
away, but no one reported witnessing the shooting.

   A Peace Corps volunteer freed after 50
days as the hostage of anti-American rebels in the Philippines says
he hopes to return to his adopted country some day.
   ``We're definitely going back. I don't know when,'' Tim Swanson
said after he arrived in Cheyenne on Tuesday.
   Swanson, 26, dined on steak and his mother's rhubarb pie after a
24-hour trip from Manila.
   He was freed by the New People's Army on Thursday after the
Philippine military agreed to a three-day truce. He was turned over
to the International Red Cross and taken to the U.S. Embassy in
Manila, where he was checked by doctors.
   The Peace Corps sent its volunteers home from the Philippines on
June 27 because of reported threats from rebels. U.S. officials
said they were unaware of Swanson's kidnapping when the order was
issued.
   Swanson, who is married to a Filipino teacher, said he
contemplated escaping but discarded the idea.
   ``Bbasically I knew I would get out sometime and I wanted ...
that when I eventually did get out to have no more problems with
the NPA because I wanted to be able to come back to the Philippines
without worrying about them anymore,'' he said.
   Swanson said he had little to do but sit and wait in the rebels'
jungle hideout near his Philippine home of Patag.
   ``They just told me to rest, take it easy,'' he said. ``I paced
up and down some. Peeled the bark off the wood that our shelter was
built out of. Daydreamed a lot. Sat around doing pretty much
nothing quite a bit.''
   Swanson said he had a radio for part of the time and listened to
reports of the efforts to free him. He also heard from his captors
that there had been speculation that he went willingly with them.
   ``They thought that sounded pretty silly,'' he said. ``I thought
it was pretty crazy-sounding myself.''

<HEAD>Mirror Flaw Threatens to Delay Weather Satellite Launching</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mirror design flaw in a new $1 billion series
of weather satellites could delay their launch and leave
forecasters ``standing in front of blank screens,'' The New York
Times reported today.
   The flaw is in mirrors meant to reflect images from the
satellites' telescopes, the newspaper said, citing federal
officials and experts. The problem is that the mirrors warp when
heated, as sunlight would do in outer space.
   The trouble is another blow to NASA, which is supervising the
satellites' construction. The space agency already is reeling from
problems with its shuttle fleet and a defective mirror on its $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   The two mirror problems are technically unrelated, the Times
said.
   Officials said they have no estimate of how much it will cost to
correct the satellite mirror problem or how long the launch of the
first advanced satellite might be delayed. It is scheduled for
1992, but the Times said unofficial estimates put the delay at
anywhere from two months to more than a year.
   James R. Greaves, NASA program manager for meteorological
satellites, said the ``scary aspect'' is that the nation is now
down to one working advanced satellite.
   ``If that fails, weather people are going to be standing in
front of blank screens,'' he said.
   The United States also has planes, radar and other satellites
that contain forecasting equipment, but only this type of satellite
gives a comprehensive view of the weather situation at any instant.
   The five-year lifetime of the current advanced satellite, which
beams the weather pictures used in newspapers and on television,
ends in February 1992, although it might last longer.
   Elbert W. Friday Jr., head of the National Weather Service, said
that loss of advanced satellite coverage would constitute ``a
national emergency,'' with significantly less capability for making
forecasts and tracking hurricanes and other storms.
   The five new satellites are being built by Ford Aerospace under
NASA supervision, at a cost of $1 billion. Greaves said the mirrors
had been built correctly by the Applied Optics Corp. according to
ITT Corp. specifications.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index today posted
its eighth-largest gain and almost erased the previous day's huge
losses that were blamed at least in part on the Persian Gulf
crisis. The dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average recouped 856.07 points, or 3.10
percent, ending the day at 28,509.14 in moderate trading. First
section volume was estimated at 580 million shares, compared with
Tuesday's volume of 500 million.
   Today's gain was the first since July 31 and the eighth-largest
ever.
   The Nikkei's rebound was helped by index-linked bargain-hunting
in reaction to Tuesday's big drop, traders said.
   They said the index's strength also reflected stability in bond
and currency markets, as well as a drop in oil prices in Tokyo.
   The yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond closed lower at 7.915 percent from Tuesday's close of 8.105
percent. Its price ended at 83.80 points, up from 82.98 points.
   Oil prices sharply fell in Tokyo. At about 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT),
Brent for October delivery was valued at about $26.00-26.20 a
barrel, down from $27.80-28.00 Tuesday in Asia.
   ``The stock market has bottomed out with yesterday's plunge,''
said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   ``Market players felt they had sold too much and began picking
up underpriced issues to adjust their positions,'' he said.
   Since last Thursday, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the index had
dropped 3,184.92 points, or 11.5 percent, topped by Tuesday's
946.46-point loss. The index's 27,653.07 close Tuesday was the
lowest level since Oct. 26, 1988, when the index fell to 27,620.60.
   The Tokyo stock market, already vulnerable due to higher
interest rates, had lost 5,204.88 points between July 20 and Aug. 7.
   Inoue said the market will remain nervous until the Iraq-Kuwait
dispute starts moving toward a peaceful settlement. He also
predicted some more selling for technical adjustment involving
option trading. The final day of August option trading is scheduled
for Thursday.
   On the foreign exchange market that reacted nervously to news
reports about the Middle East, the dollar ended at 150.00 yen, down
0.60 yen from Tuesday's finish. It opened higher at 150.63 yen, and
ranged between 149.85 and 150.63.
   After its morning slip following dollar-selling for
profit-taking by some trading companies, the dollar rose back to
the day's high in the afternoon, when the market was swayed by the
report that President Bush was sending troops to Saudi Arabia, said
Eiichi Seino, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   Market players than sold the dollar for position adjustment when
a rumor of an important announcement by Bush scheduled later today
failed to be confirmed before trading ended, he said.

   The spray-painted words on the wall of an
abandoned building express what many in the city's large Iraqi
community are afraid to say.
   ``The Iraqi government continues to torture the Iraqi people,''
reads the message. ``NO to the fascist government in Iraq.''
   The graffiti stands out among the businesses and residences
owned by Chaldeans _ Christian Arabs, mostly from Iraq _ whose
largest community in the United States is in the Detroit area.
   Most Chaldeans here have relatives in Iraq and refuse to comment
on the invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's troops,
said a gasoline station owner who refused to give his name.
   ``Some of them like Saddam Hussein. Some of them don't,'' he
said. ``People are afraid of him.''
   About 45,000 Chaldeans live in the Detroit area, said Father
Manuel Boji, the priest at the Chaldean Diocese in suburban
Southfield. Chaldeans emerged after Christianity spread to the
Middle East, where Islam is the dominant religion.
   Most Chaldeans in the area come from northern Iraq and few wish
to return, Boji said Tuesday.
   They open grocery stores, selling fruit and vegetables from
wooden bins on the sidewalks. They work as dentists, advertising on
signs in Arabic and English. They raise their children, worrying
about families in Iraq.
   And they stay quiet about Saddam.
   ``Some are for him. Some are not,'' said Karim Hakim, a retired
grocery store owner in Southfield.
   Hakim left Baghdad in 1925, returning only to get married in
1937.
   ``Some of them just left recently within three or four years and
they're for him. Lots of them have to be because they're afraid for
their people,'' he said.
   ``Saddam Hussein is No. 1,'' said a teen-ager as he walked in
the Chaldean neighborhood. The youth refused to be identified, but
he and five friends cheered Saddam's invasion of Kuwait. ``He's
doing the right thing for our people,'' he said.
   Hakim said Chaldeans who left Iraq several years ago have fewer
loyalties and less fear of Hussein's government than more recent
arrivals.
   ``I'm not for (the invasion),'' Hakim said. ``I'm American. I've
been here all my life mostly, so that's it.''

<TEXT>
   The woman whose intimate relationship with Roman
Catholic Archbishop Eugene Marino led to his resignation claims she
was secretly married to him nearly two years ago, her lawyer says.
   Vicki R. Long and Marino exchanged what she considered wedding
vows in December 1988 during a trip to New York, attorney Anthony
Fontana said Tuesday.
   Fontana said he was not sure of the details ``but I do know that
she says that at one point in time he got her to perform vows and I
think it's a further indication of the tremendous amount of control
that he had over her.''
   Archdiocese spokesman Peter Dora denied Marino and Ms. Long had
wed.
   ``There is no marriage that would be recognized by the state or
by the church,'' he said.
   Marino, 56, resigned earlier this year because of what
archdiocese officials said last week was an intimate relationship
with Ms. Long, 27, of Riverdale. Marino had been the nation's
highest ranking black Catholic.
   Ms. Long also claims she was seduced by a nun during a trip to
Pittsburgh when she was 19, The Atlanta Constitution reported
today, citing two unidentified sources familiar with an account Ms.
Long gave church officials.
   The newspaper did not give the nun's name. Ms. Long's
allegations about the nun surfaced in her 1987 paternity suit
against the Rev. Donal Keohane of Columbus, who she claimed
fathered her 4-year-old daughter, the newspaper said.
   Blood tests showed that Keohane was not the father, but the
archdiocese is paying child support.
   The Rev. Michael Woods, a Sandy Springs priest, resigned
Saturday after admitting he, too, had an intimate relationship with
Ms. Long.
   Ms. Long has denied she had a sexual relationship with Woods.
She has not said whether she had a sexual relationship with the
archbishop.
   Marino, whose whereabouts have been withheld by the church, has
not commented publicly on his relationship with Ms. Long.

   Showers were scattered along the Atlantic seaboard from Maine to
the Carolinas today, and extreme heat lingered in the Southwest.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms in the deserts of
Southern California and Arizona and in Florida, Georgia and South
Carolina. Showers were expected along the East Coast.
   Hurricane Diana was expected to bring flooding to Mexico.
   On Tuesday, temperatures dropped to record lows across the
nation's midsection, and heavy rain caused flooding in the
Northeast.
   Record lows mostly in the 50s and 60s were reported in Texas,
New Mexico, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Kansas, West
Virginia, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee and
Colorado.
   Billings, Mont., warmed to a record high of 103. Temperatures
along the northern half of the Rockies were as much as 15 degrees
higher than normal.
   The high temperature for the nation Tuesday was 120 at Death

   Ruby-red mulberry jam made from fruit
grown near the Hanford nuclear plant has been sent to Energy
Secretary James Watkins and Gov. Booth Gardner.
   They should have no problem recognizing the gifts. They're
labeled ``Radioactive. Do not eat.''
   Two scientists said they made the jam during the weekend from
mulberries gathered along the banks of the Columbia River beside
the Hanford complex in south-central Washington. They say the jam
is contaminated with strontium 90, a deadly isotope present in
radioactive fallout.
   Oceanographer Norm Buske and his wife, mathematician Linda
Josephson, said they wanted to alert state and federal officials
that contamination of vegetation near the closed N Reactor could
pose a safety hazard.
   Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, which has been
contracted by the government to monitor the plant, said researchers
have known for years that vegetation in ``no trespassing'' areas
near the reactor is contaminated.
   Strontium 90 ``has not been reported in mulberries before, but
it's been documented in other vegetation in the area for several
years,'' said Battelle Pacific spokesman Jerry Holloway.
   The isotope is a byproduct of nuclear weapons production and was
knowingly and legally released around the riverside N Reactor, he
said.
   Buske and his wife, who operate an independent laboratory about
75 miles northeast of the reservation, said they were concerned
that strontium 90 is present in edible plants accessible by boat.
The isotope travels through underground springs to the river, Buske
said.
   The jam, which Buske said was shipped Monday by Federal Express,
arrived at the governor's office Tuesday, said Dick Milne,
Gardner's press secretary. It was not known if Watkins' office
received the jam.
   ``The mulberry jam with the little extra something'' has been
sent to a state radiation lab for further analysis, Milne said.
   The jam's contents were not revealed to Federal Express, Buske
said.
   Under federal standards, the jam contains 80 to 90 times the
strontium 90 levels allowed in daily consumption in drinking water,
Buske wrote in an accompanying letter. But the jam would only pose
``a minimal risk'' if it was eaten, he said.
   The couple also gathered curly dog, an edible green, along the
riverbank, which is posted with ``no trespassing'' signs, but opted
not to deliver it because it could be harmful if handled.
   ``This is not a hollow exercise,'' Buske said. ``We are
convinced that some of their radiation pathways are dangerous to
the public.''
   Most of the plutonium used in U.S. nuclear weapons was made at
the 600-square-mile plant near Richland, Wash. It is considered the
most severely polluted site in the federal weapons complex.
Technology to handle some of the hottest radioactive wastes does
not exist.
   The full cleanup is expected to take more than 30 years and cost
more than $100 billion.

<HEAD>Metabolism Rebounds After Extremely Low-Calorie Diets, Study Says</HEAD>

   The crash diet that gave Oprah Winfrey her svelte
new figure does not permanently lower the body's metabolism, a
study says.
   Many people have worried that crash dieting permanently lowers a
person's metabolism _ the rate at which the body at rest burns
calories _ making it harder and harder to shed more pounds and to
keep the weight off.
   Today, a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association found that the Optifast liquid diet caused women's
metabolism to plunge, but it rebounded after they began eating
normal food. The study was funded in part by Optifast.
   The diet helped the women lose almost 50 pounds in four months,
the study said.
   ``The good news is that the study showed dieting, when combined
with exercise, does not result in a long-term reduction in
metabolic rate,'' said lead researcher Thomas A. Wadden. ``The bad
news is that it's still a struggle to maintain weight loss.''
   Wadden, associate professor of psychology at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine and clinical director of its
Obesity Research Group, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that
for every 25 pounds of weight loss, a dieter must eat 100 fewer
calories a day than in pre-diet days to maintain the loss.
   Wadden also is a consultant to the Sandoz Nutrition Co., maker
of Optifast. Miss Winfrey shed 67 pounds on the Optifast diet.
   The study compared nine women who went on the 420-calorie-a-day
Optifast program with nine women who went on a diet of conventional
food totaling 1,200 calories a day.
   The metabolism of the Optifast women dropped 22 percent over 16
weeks, when they were consuming only the liquid diet, while the
metabolism of the others fell about 13 percent.
   Metabolism rates of the Optifast group rose to within 11 percent
of initial rates during the following six weeks, when the women
were gradually switched from to about 1,100 calories of normal food
a day, the study found.
   Metabolism in the 1,200-calorie group rose to within 8.6 percent
of original levels during that period.
   Exercise _ walking up to 20 minutes at a time, three times a
week _ was an important part of the program for both groups, said
Wadden.
   ``We're not sure why that is,'' he said. ``It may have some
long-term effect on metabolic rates. More importantly, it simply
burns up calories.''
   Over the entire 48 weeks of the study, women in the Optifast
group lost about 48 pounds each; women on the 1,200-calorie diets
lost about 40 pounds each. Subjects weighed an average of 216
pounds at the beginning of the study.
   Dr. Peter D. Vash, assistant clinical professor of medicine at
the medical school of the University of California at Los Angeles,
said the study will not be news to researchers in the field.
   ``I concur with Dr. Wadden's conclusion, that diet will not
adversely permanently affect the metabolic rate,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Vash emphasized that such extremely low-calorie diets are
appropriate only with proper supervision and only for the obese.
Optifast, which costs about $3,000 and requires at least a year's
commitment, is supervised through hospitals.

<TEXT>
   An Army chaplain who faked a heroic
record with the elite Green Berets and Rangers in the Vietnam War
was dismissed and fined $10,000 after pleading guilty during a
court-martial.
   Maj. Gary Probst, who joined the Army in the 1980s, was ordered
Tuesday to pay $1,000 a month for 10 months, said a Fort Lewis base
spokesman, Maj. Martin Eckert.
   Probst's sentence will automatically be reviewed. In the
meantime, he has been assigned to administrative duties.
   He pleaded guilty to five violations of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice. Probst wore 15 insignia he never earned,
including the Bronze Star and the Vietnam campaign ribbon, ruled
Lt. Col. Richard Mann, a military judge.
   Probst, 37, also admitted making false statements in his list of
career duties and decorations, disobeying an order by returning to
the 1st Special Forces Group complex after being ordered to stay
away, putting in a false claim of about $100 in motel bills and
taking a government-owned chair for personal use.
   Probst, a Mormon chaplain who worked at the 1st Special Forces
Group, could have been given a dishonorable discharge and up to 20
years in prison.
   He indicated in an interview before his court-martial that he
wore the insignia to gain the trust of soldiers.
   Probst served at Fort Gordon, Ga., and Schofield Barracks,
Hawaii, before coming to Fort Lewis in 1987, Eckert said.

   Suspended Navajo tribal leader Peter
MacDonald survived a hard-fought primary and will face longtime foe
Peterson Zah in November for the tribe's highest office.
   Zah, tribal chairman from 1983 to 1987, was the top vote-getter
Tuesday, with 13,785 votes, or 30 percent. MacDonald was next in
the 15-candidate field with 10,322 votes, or 22.7 percent, edging
interim President Leonard Haskie.
   In a restructuring, the president will replace the tribal
chairman as leader of the 172,000-member reservation in Arizona,
New Mexico and Utah.
   About half the more than 95,000 eligible voters on the
reservation turned out for the election.
   Zah, 53, defeated MacDonald in 1982, but MacDonald regained the
post in 1986. The Tribal Council placed MacDonald on paid leave in
1989 following U.S. Senate testimony that MacDonald had accepted
bribes and kickbacks.
   MacDonald, 61, is awaiting three trials in tribal court on
charges of bribery, fraud and election violations. His first trial
is scheduled for Sept. 18. He has denied any wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Dollar Generally Higher, Gold Also Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was generally higher in nervous
European trading late this morning as dealers positioned themselves
for a possible war in the Middle East.
   Gold prices were also higher as the market continued to be
buffeted by rumors and counter-rumors regarding rising tension from
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last week, dealers said.
   News that Iraq planned an ``important announcement'' later today
raised tension in the currency markets.
   President Bush sent troops to Saudi Arabia ``and the dollar's a
few points higher,'' said one trader at a major West German bank in
Frankfurt. ``At such times one has to buy a few dollars. It's
purely a precaution.''
   But one Milan dealer said room for the dollar to move higher is
limited because the U.S. currency ``seems to have lost its role as
a safe haven.''
   ``The market is discounting a possible intervention by the U.S.
in the Middle East,'' the dealer said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.50 yen to a closing 150.00 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 150.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.5905 West German marks, up from 1.5763
   _1.3350 Swiss francs, up from 1.3315
   _5.3293 French francs, up from 5.2995
   _1.7858 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7785
   _1,164.00 Italian lire, up from 1,155.37
   _1.1511 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1495
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound and was
quoted at $1.8733, compared with $1.8765 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $383.00 a troy ounce,
down from $383.25 bid late Tuesday. But at midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $384.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $385.25, up from $383.15 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 87 cents to close at a bid
$382.65.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.88 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $4.89.

<HEAD>Ex-Bodyguard Of Mrs. Mandela Sentenced To Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former bodyguard of Winnie
Mandela was sentenced to death today for murdering a 14-year-old
black activist who had been kidnapped and held at Mrs. Mandela's
house.
   Supreme Court Justice Brian O'Donovan rejected arguments from
the defense that 37-year-old Jerry Richardson's desire to gain Mrs.
Mandela's favor was a mitigating factor in the killing.
   ``It is difficult to see how kidnap and murder can be mitigated
by the desire to please anybody,'' said O'Donovan.
   He also sentenced Richardson to 18 years' imprisonment for
kidnapping, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and
attempted murder.
   James ``Stompie'' Seipei Moeketsi was found stabbed to death in
January 1989 after Richardson led him away from Mrs. Mandela's
house in the black township of Soweto.
   According to the testimony, Stompie was accused of being a
police informer.
   Black leaders later criticized the group surrounding Mrs.
Mandela, saying they had engaged in a ``reign of terror'' in Soweto
and that the community should shun Mrs. Mandela.
   She began to reappear at anti-apartheid rallies a few months
before her husband Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African
National Congress, was released from prison in February.
   O'Donovan said the evidence indicated Mrs. Mandela was at her
home at the time of the beatings.
   Mrs. Mandela has not been charged in the case, and declined a
request by Richardson's lawyers to testify on his behalf. Her
driver and other associates are scheduled for trial on kidnapping
and assault charges in September.
   Only Richardson was tried for Stompie's murder.
   President F. W. de Klerk suspended all hangings in February, but
courts still have the option of imposing the death sentence in
murder cases when the judge finds there are no mitigating factors.

   A 95-year-old man awaiting trial for murder was
struck by a bus and killed after receiving special permission to
leave his apartment for a hospital visit, police said.
   ``This is more than ironic, it's Kafkaesque,'' said Manhattan
Supreme Court Justice Rose Rubin, the judge who was to preside at
Barre's trial.
   Oliver Barre was hit by a city bus as he walked across the
street with a companion Tuesday morning on his way to a Veterans
Administration hospital about a block away, police said. He died
two hours later at Bellevue Hospital, hospital spokeswoman Brenda
Rivera said.
   Helen Carroll, 90, described by Rivera as Barre's girlfriend,
suffered head injuries and was listed in serious condition this
morning at Bellevue, said hospital administrator Robert Frazier.
   The bus driver, Basil Pesce, was cited for failing to yield to
pedestrians, police said. He was not injured in the accident, and
the bus carried no passengers.
   Barre was charged with second-degree murder in the metal pipe
bludgeoning of an elderly neighbor June 16.
   He pleaded innocent and was due in court Oct. 4. Barre claimed
his victim, Norma Marks, 88, had tried to strangle him and poison
other people in his building.
   More than 140 residents of Barre's apartment building petitioned
to have him jailed after the murder.
   However, Rubin allowed him out on bail provided he only leave
his apartment from 2 to 4 p.m.
   On Monday, his lawyer got special permission for Barre to go to
the VA hospital Tuesday morning.

<HEAD>Heart Valve Manufacturer Reports Defects To Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A heart valve manufacturer bowed to the
demands of consumer activists and agreed to inform thousands of
implant patients of potential defects.
   Shiley Inc. of Irvine, a subsidiary of New York-based Pfizer
Inc., said Tuesday it will identify and notify 21,000 patients in
the United States of product defects that could prove dangerous.
   Its notices will advise patients about the warning signs of
mechanical valve failure and what steps to take should the device
fail, company officials said.
   The announcement affects those patients who received the
Bjork-Shiley 60-degree ``convexo-concave'' heart valve. The company
voluntarily pulled the valves from the U.S. market in 1986
following reports of valve fractures.
   Roger Sachs, vice president and medical director at Shiley, said
the firm was determining how patients will be notified. He said
Shiley was negotiating with another company to compile a registry
of implant patients.
   The decision comes after Public Citizen Health Research Group, a
Washington, D.C.-based consumer organization, filed a lawsuit
against Shiley and Pfizer to force Shiley to warn patients about
the defects.
   A judge dismissed the suit in May after ruling that the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration had sole authority to issue such an
order.
   ``If the company does what it says it is going to do, there is
no question that some people who otherwise would die will live,''
said Public Citizen's director, Dr. Sidney Wolfe.
   ``I think they (Shiley) saw the handwriting on the wall and
yielded to something they should have done a long time ago,'' he
added.
   Originally, Shiley had cautioned only surgeons about the valve's
problems, replying upon them to notify their patients.
   In March, the company mailed warnings to surgeons,
cardiologists, primary physicians and emergency room practitioners.
   A statement issued Tuesday by Shiley said the decision to notify
patients directly came in response to FDA concerns that physicians
may not have effectively communicated the product's defects to
implant patients.
   Shiley officials added they will ask the FDA to review the
notices it will send to patients.
   FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the agency could decide by
early next year whether to require valve manufacturers to notify
patients directly of any potential product defects.

<TEXT>
   State tax collections rose by 7.5 percent in
fiscal 1989 over the previous year, the Commerce Department says.
   The agency said Tuesday that state tax collections totaled $284
billion in 1989, up from $264 billion a year earlier.
   Eight states reported increases of more than 10 percent
including Oregon, up 22.5 percent, and California, up 14.2 percent.
   Other increases above 10 percent included 13.4 percent in
Delaware, 12.7 percent in Alaska, 11.5 percent in Idaho, 11.1
percent in Indiana, 10.8 percent in Iowa and 10.2 percent in
Kentucky.
   Only Utah and South Dakota reported decreases in state tax
collections. Utah was down 11.4 percent while South Dakota dropped
1.7 percent.
   The Commerce Department said the national average per capita
state tax ranged from a high of $2,675 in Alaska to $554 in New
Hampshire.
   Alaska, New Hampshire and Wyoming have no state income or sales
taxes. The severance tax, which applies to oil and other minerals
extracted from the earth, is the primary source of state income in
Alaska and Wyoming, while the corporate net income tax is the
largest source in New Hampshire.
   Other states ranking at the top of the per capita list were:
Hawaii, 1,994; Delaware, $1,679; Massachusetts, $1,534;
Connecticut, $1,485; New York, $1,481; Minnesota, $1,470;
California, $1,418; Washington, $1,367, and New Jersey, $1,357.
   In addition to New Hampshire, other states at the end of the per
capita list were: South Dakota, $655; Texas, $822; Tennessee, $823;
Utah, $832; Colorado, $875; Mississippi, $882; Alabama, $889,
Nebraska, $900, and Arkansas, $903.
   More than half of the state tax revenues were collected by just
nine states: California, $41.2 billion; New York, $26.6 billion;
Texas, $14 billion; Pennsylvania, $12.6 billion; Florida, $12.5
billion, Illinois, $11.8 billion; Michigan, $11.1 billion; Ohio,
$10.8 billion, and New Jersey, $10.5 billion.
   As usual, general sales and gross receipts taxes were the
largest source of state taxes in 1989, up 7.3 percent to $93.4
billion. Individual income taxes gained 10.7 percent to $88.7
billion, while corporate net income taxes rose 4.8 percent to $23.9
billion.

   President Bush didn't mention Adolf Hitler or
World War II today in his speech on the Iraq crisis, but they
clearly were on his mind as he described Saddam Hussein and the
tactics needed to stop him.
   ``As in the case of the 1930s, we see in Saddam Hussein an
aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors,'' Bush said.
   ``Twice we have seen what his promises have meant. His promises
mean nothing,'' the president said, apparently referring to
Thursday's invasion of Kuwait and Saddam's offer Friday to withdraw
his troops.
   ``Appeasement does not work,'' Bush said.
   ``If history teaches us anything, it is that we must resist
aggression or it will destroy our freedoms,'' he said. ``This is

   Here is the text of President Bush's address
Wednesday on the Iraq crisis:
   In the life of a nation we're called upon to define who we are
and what we believe. Sometimes these choices are not easy. But
today as president I ask for your support in a decision I've made
to stand up for what's right and condemn what's wrong all in the
cause of peace.
   At my direction, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, as well
as key units of the United States Air Force, are arriving today to
take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia. I took this action to
assist the Saudi Arabian government in the defense of its homeland.
No one commits America's armed forces to a dangerous mission
lightly, but after perhaps unparalleled international consultation
and exhausting every alternative, it became necessary to take this
action.
   And let me tell you why. Less than a week ago in the early
morning hours of August 2nd, Iraqi armed forces, without
provocation or warning, invaded a peaceful Kuwait. Facing
negligible resistance from its much smaller neighbor, Iraq's tanks
stormed in blitzkrieg fashion through Kuwait in a few short hours.
With more than 100,000 troops, along with tanks, artillery and
surface to surface missiles, Iraq now occupies Kuwait.
   This aggression came just hours after Saddam Hussein
specifically assured numerous countries in the area that there
would be no invasion. There is no justification whatsoever for this
outrageous and brutal act of aggression. A puppet regime imposed
from the outside is unacceptable. The acquisition of territory by
force is unacceptable. No one, friend or foe, should doubt our
desire for peace, and no one should underestimate our determination
to confront aggression.
   Four simple principles guide our policy.
   First, we seek the immediate, unconditional and complete
withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   Second, Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored to
replace the puppet regime.
   And third, my administration, as has been the case with every
president from President Roosevelt to President Reagan, is
committed to the security and stability of the Persian Gulf.
   And fourth, I am determined to protect the lives of American
citizens abroad.
   Immediately after the Iraqi invasion, I ordered an embargo of
all trade with Iraq, and together with many other nations,
announced sanctions that both froze all Iraqi assets in this
country and protected Kuwait's assets. The stakes are high. Iraq is
already a rich and powerful country that possesses the world's
second largest reserves of oil and over a million men under arms.
It's the fourth largest military in the world.
   Our country now imports nearly half the oil it consumes, and
could face a major threat to its economic independence. Much of the
world is even more dependent upon imported oil and is even more
vulnerable to Iraqi threats. We succeeded in the struggle for
freedom in Europe because we and our allies remain stalwart.
   Keeping the peace in the Middle East will require no less.

   We're beginning a new era. This new era can be full of promise,
an age of freedom, a time of peace for all peoples. But if history
teaches us anything, it is that we must resist aggression or it
will destroy our freedoms. Appeasement does not work. As was the
case in the 1930s, we see in Saddam Hussein an aggressive dictator
threatening his neighbors.
   On 14 days ago, Saddam Hussein promised his friends he would not
invade Kuwait and four days ago he promised the world he would
withdraw. And twice we have seen what his promises mean. His
promises mean nothing.
   In the last few days, I have spoken with political leaders from
the Middle East, Europe, Asia and the Americas and I have met with
Prime Minister Thatcher, Prime Minister Mulroney and NATO Secretary
General Woerner. And all agree that Iraq cannot be allowed to
benefit from its invasion of Kuwait.
   We agree that this is not an American problem or a European
problem or a Middle East problem. It is the world's problem. And
that's why, soon after the Iraqi invasion, the United Nations
Security Council, without dissent, condemned Iraq, calling for the
immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its troops from Kuwait.
   The Arab world, through both the Arab League and the Gulf
Cooperation Council, courageously announced its opposition to Iraqi
aggression. Japan, the United Kingdom and France and other
governments around the world have imposed severe sanctions. The
Soviet Union and China ended all arms sales to Iraq. And this past
Monday, the United Nations Security Council approved, for the first
time in 23 years, mandatory sanctions under Chapter 7 of the United
Nations Charter.
   These sanctions now enshrined in international law, have the
potential to deny Iraq the fruits of aggression while sharply
limiting its ability to either import or export anything of value,
especially oil.
   I pledge here today that the United States will do its part to
see that these sanctions are effective and to induce Iraq to
withdraw without delay from Kuwait.
   But we must recognize that Iraq may not stop using force to
advance its ambitions. Iraq has massed an enormous war machine on
the Saudi border capable of initiating hostilities with little or
no additional preparation. Given the Iraqi government's history of
aggression against its own citizens as well as its neighbors, to
assume Iraq will not attack again would be unwise and unrealistic.
   And therefore, after consulting with King Fahd, I sent Secretary
of Defense Dick Cheney to discuss cooperative measures we could
take. Following those meetings, the Saudi government requested our
help. And I responded to that request by ordering US air and ground
forces to deploy to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Let me be clear,
the sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital interest to
the United States.
   This decision, which I shared with the congressional leadership,
grows out of the longstanding friendship and security relationship
between the United States and Saudi Arabia. U.S. forces will work
together with those of Saudi Arabia and other nations to preserve
the integrity of Saudi Arabia and to deter further Iraqi
aggression. Through their presence, as well as through training and
exercises, these multinational forces will enhance the overall
capability of Saudi armed forces to defend the Kingdom.
   I want to be clear about what we are doing and why. America does
not seek conflict, nor do we seek to chart the destiny of other
nations. But America will stand by her friend. The mission of our
troops is wholly defensive. Hopefully, they will not be needed
long. They will not initiate hostilities, but they will defend
themselves, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other friends in the
Persian Gulf.
   We are working around the clock to deter Iraqi aggression and to
enforce UN sanctions. I'm continuing my conversations with world
leaders. Secretary of Defense Cheney has just returned from
valuable consultations with President Mubarak of Egypt and King
Hassan of Morocco.

   President Bush today said he will ask other
oil-producing nations to replace embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil on
world markets and explore whether to dip into the nation's
strategic reserves to bolster supplies.
   The president also asked Americans to conserve energy and called
on oil companies to ``do their fair share'' and try to hold the
line on prices.
   Bush did not name the countries he planned to call on to
increase production. The president of Venezuela said Tuesday his
nation would try to increase production, according to an official
traveling with Vice President Dan Quayle, who met with the
Venezuelan leader.
   Bush's sanctions against Iraq for invading Kuwait include a
trade embargo that bans import of either Iraqi or Kuwaiti oil.
Although supplies are said to be high, prices for gas and other
petroleum products have increased in the days since the invasion,
prompting criticism from Congress and administration officials.
   ``I'm asking the oil companies to do their fair share,'' Bush,
himself a former oilman, said in his nationally televised address
from the Oval Office. ``Conservation measures also can help,'' the
president said. ``Americans everywhere must do their part.''
   Bush said he and the leaders of other nations boycotting Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil were exploring whether it would be necessary to
draw from oil reserves.
   In the meantime, Bush said he was asking ``all producing nations
to do what they can to increase production'' in order to minimize
the effect of the boycott.
   On Tuesday, the Energy Department said the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve is ready for use in the event of severe oil shortages but
would not be used just to keep prices low.
   Some in Congress have called on Bush to tap the reserve to push
prices back down.
   The oil reserve was established in response to the 1973-74 Arab
oil embargo and built to its current size at a cost of about $20
billion, which includes the cost of the oil, and preparing and
maintaining the storage site. It has been tapped only once, when
Congress ordered 2 million barrels auctioned to oil companies in
1985.
   It would take at least 16 days from a presidential request for
oil to flow from the reserve, Energy Department spokesman Phil Keif
said. During that time, bids from oil companies would have to be
submitted, reviewed and chosen.

   Secretary of State Baker has consulted with his counterparts in

Europe to consult with President Ozal of Turkey, a staunch friend
of the United States. And he'll then consult with the NATO foreign
ministers.
   I will ask oil producing nations to do what they can to increase
production in order to minimize any impact that oil flow reductions
will have on the world economy. And I will explore whether we and
our allies should draw down our strategic petroleum reserves.
Conservation measures can also help. Americans everywhere must do
their part.
   And one more thing. I'm asking the oil companies to do their

uncertainties to raise prices.
   Standing up for our principles will not come easy. It may take
time and possibly cost a great deal. But we are asking no more of
anyone than of the brave young men and women of our armed forces
and their families. And I ask that in the churches around the

defend America's interests.
   Standing up for our principles is an American tradition. As it
has so many times before, it may take time and tremendous effort,
but most of all, it will take unity of purpose.
   As I have witnessed throughout my life in both war and peace,
America has never wavered when her purpose is driven by principle.
And on this August day, at home and abroad, I know she will do no
less.
   Thank you and God bless the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   The jury in Marion Barry's drug and perjury
trial resumed deliberations today after refusing to reveal its
verdict on one of the 14 counts.
   On Tuesday, the mayor's lawyer conceded for the first time that
Barry may be convicted on some counts.
   Jury foreman Edward Eagles sent a note to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson late Tuesday indicating the jury had
``reached a verdict on count 12,'' Jackson said.
   That count stems from the testimony of former Carter
administration aide Doris Crenshaw, who said that she and Barry had
snorted cocaine together in her Washington hotel room between Nov.
7 and Nov. 10, 1988.
   ``Have you reached a verdict?'' Jackson asked Eagles.
   ``I would prefer that you poll the jury,'' the foreman replied.
   After a moment, Jackson asked whether the jury wanted to reveal
its decision.
   ``Not at this time,'' said a woman juror. A male juror shook his
head.
   Jackson then dismissed the panel of nine women and three men for
the day after answering a routine evidentiary question.
Deliberations resumed this morning.
   The panel last Thursday began deliberating the 14 charges
against Barry _ three felony counts of perjury, one misdemeanor
count of conspiracy and 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession.
   Meanwhile, chief defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy speculated
Tuesday that Barry could be convicted on some counts.
   ``You're going to get some hung counts ... some acquittals ...
you might get one or two convictions,'' Mundy said. ``My opinion is
they've passed the perjury ... (and) ...he's going to be
acquitted'' of those counts.
   Allen Palmer, a former federal prosecutor who now works as a
criminal defense attorney, speculated that Eagles declined to
reveal the jury's decision because one or more jurors became
uncertain about their conclusion.
   ``Obviously someone was a little shaky in their resolve during
the 20 minutes or so it took to assemble people in the courtroom,''
Palmer said in an interview.
   ``One or two people indicated to the foreman that they may not
be willing to go along with their prior vote,'' he theorized.
``That's why the foreman wanted the judge to ascertain from the
jurors themselves what their individual votes were.''
   The maximum penalties for conviction on all 14 criminal charges
against the mayor are 26 years in prison and $1.85 million in
fines. Under federal sentencing guidelines, however, any sentence
would be far less than the maximum.
   The defense has acknowledged the mayor was an occasional user of
cocaine but has contended the government has not proven charges
concerning use at specific times and places.
   Witnesses at the trial testified that Barry snorted and smoked
cocaine and smoked opium and marijuana some 200 times.
   Thirteen witnesses said they saw Barry use cocaine between 1983
and last January when the mayor was videotaped by the FBI smoking
crack. Three other witnesses said they saw Barry smoke marijuana.
Admitted cocaine dealer Lydia Pearson said she sold crack to the
mayor about 25 times in a three-month span.

<HEAD>Bhutto: Army Threatened to Impose Martial Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
said today the army had threatened to impose martial law as a way
of forcing the president to dismiss her 20-month-old government.
   On Monday, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved Ms. Bhutto's
government, citing widespread corruption among senior officials,
misuse of power and the failure to control ethnic violence in her
home province of Sindh. He named a caretaker government and called
for elections on October.
   ``The president's speech was prepared by the military
headquarters,'' Ms. Bhutto claimed at a news conference. That
charge has been denied by both the military and Ishaq Khan.
   ``The caretaker government is temporary,'' she added. ``Within a
few weeks, the army will take over.''
   An army spokesman said Ishaq Khan had consulted the army chief
of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, before making his decision to
dismiss the government, but he denied the president was pressured
by Beg.
   ``It was in the offing for a very long time,'' the army
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Even they
(Ms. Bhutto's government) were aware of it.''
   He also rejected Ms. Bhutto's claim that the military was
considering the imposition of martial law.
   The spokesman said with tensions high on the border with
neighboring India, the army would be unable to declare martial law
and deploy large numbers of troops to patrol in cities.
   Ms. Bhutto's critics and even members of her own Pakistan
People's Party said she had been warned repeatedly to reform her
government.
   Ms. Bhutto told reporters she had no differences with the army
until May, when disputes emerged over the conflicts in neighboring
Afghanistan and in Kashmir, the disputed territory divided between
India and Pakistan.
   ``Until May there were no differences between me and Gen. Beg,
but when the process of repatriation started, major differences
developed,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto claimed the army opposed the repatriation of 3.8
million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan, saying it would give
legitimacy to the Soviet-backed government in Kabul that
U.S.-supplied guerrillas have been fighting to overthrow.
   Ms. Bhutto also claimed the army wanted to go to war with India
over Kashmir, where a Moslem uprising for independence from mainly
Hindu India has claimed more than 900 lives since late January. Ms.
Bhutto said she opposed a war with India.
   An army spokesman dismissed those allegations.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Mexican Foreign Secretary Fernando Solana joined forces today in
condemning the Iraqi conquest of Kuwait and demanded an immediate
withdrawal of Iraqi forces.
   The occasion was a gathering of more than 150 American and
Mexican officials, including nine cabinet members from each side,
to discuss such issues as energy supplies, drug trafficking and
immigration.
   One U.S. official said the assemblage constituted perhaps the
largest bilateral discussion in diplomatic history. The meetings
are held annually under the auspices of the Mexico-U.S. Binational
Commission.
   Minutes after President Bush addressed the nation on the Persian
Gulf crisis, Baker stood before the delegates and condemned Iraq's
``outlaw act of blatant, illegal aggression.''
   Baker reaffirmed the administration's call for the ``immediate
withdrawal of Iraqi forces and the return of Kuwait's legitimate
government.''
   In a similar vein, Solana said Mexico condemns the Iraqi
invasion.
   ``We call for the immediate withdrawal of the invading troops.''
he said.
   Shortly after the opening ceremony ended, Baker headed for
Turkey for consultations on the Gulf crisis.
   The Iraqi invasion added a new dimension to this year's
Mexican-American conclave because of the destabilizing impact it's
having on the price and supply of oil worldwide.
   Mexico exports about half of its 2.5 million barrel daily
production of oil and stands to benefit substantially from the
recent sharp increases in oil prices.
   It was expected the two sides would discuss the possibility of
an increase in Mexico's production capacity in the event of a
significant drop in the international supply of oil.
   In his remarks, Baker said completion of a free-trade agreement
and continued progress in the war against narcotics trafficking are
two of the major challenges the United States and Mexico face.
   He said cooperation in combatting the drug trade has been better
this year than at any time in history.
   For his part, Solana said: ``Mexico is willing to multiply its
economic contacts with the United States. We believe that a fair,
free-trade agreement would be a major step in that direction.''
   Solana touched only briefly on the drug issue in his remarks.
   According to U.S. officials, the priority Mexico has given to
the issue is reflected in increased cocaine seizures: an estimated
12,000 kilos (26,500 pounds) over the last six months, most as a
result of joint Mexican-American operations.
   In addition, Mexico is pleased that the United States is
increasingly accepting Mexico's view that the U.S. government
should do more to reduce demand for narcotics.

   Iraqi state television declared today
that Kuwait is part of Iraq and called for ``full unity between
Kuwait and Iraq.''
   The statement stopped short of saying Iraq has annexed Kuwait,
but strongly suggested that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has no
intention of giving up the emirate, which his troops seized in a
lightning raid on Thursday.
   ``Our fellow citizens, history has proved that Kuwait is a part
of Iraq,'' said the statement, read by an unidentified announcer.
   ``In order to make our banners the banners of freedom and
unity...we are appealing for all Iraqis...we are appealing to all
principles of honor, to go with their heroic leader, Saddam
Hussein,'' the announcement said.
   The statement also called for Arab unity in the face of outside
threats, an apparent reference to a multinatinal force being sent
to Saudi Arabia.
   Earlier, Iraqi radio had said there would be an important
announcement today, fueling speculation that Baghdad intended to
say it had annexed Kuwait.
   The statment came less than two hours after President Bush told
the American people that U.S. troops were taking up ``defensive
positions'' in oil-rich Saudi Arabia to guard against a possible
attack by Iraq.
   Bush again demanded an immediate Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.

   Lawmakers today praised President Bush's
decision to send U.S. combat forces to Saudi Arabia to deter
further aggression by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose troops
overran neighboring Kuwait last week.
   But members of Congress cautioned that the United States should
not go it alone in protecting other Arab nations and U.S. oil
interests in the Persian Gulf region.
   ``It's important that this be a joint operation. I hope other
Arab states can get involved,'' Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., a senior
member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a telephone
interview.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., stressed during a
campaign swing for Democratic candidates in Georgia that it would
``be important if we could obtain greater and greater international
cooperation and coordination in these efforts not only on the
ground but in terms of any potential blockade.''
   ``The international support is important, I think, to American
public feeling that we're not in this alone and that we represent a
broader concern,'' Foley said in an interview on NBC's ``Today''
show.
   In an Oval office address this morning, Bush announced that U.S.
troops were taking up defensive positions in oil-rich Saudi Arabia
to guard against a possible attack by Iraq.
   Bush described the makeshift Saudi defense force as
``multinational,'' but he did not identify the participants and
there was considerable confusion about its makeup. Egypt and
Morocco denied they were involved.
   ``I think that the policy the president is following is one
that's very, very important to our national security interests, and
I think he has strong support in the Congress,'' Foley said of the
decision.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said in a CNN interview from Miami that he
endorsed Bush's actions but emphasized the need for participation
from other countries.
   ``I certainly support the concept of other nations being
involved in this matter besides just simply air and naval power,
essential as that might be,'' he said.
   ``I'll just feel a lot better when I see some other troops on
the ground joining those U.S. troops in defense of Saudi Arabia,''
Fascell said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said on CBS's ``This Morning'' program that the battle
``is to really prevent one rather demented soul, this fellow Saddam
Hussein, from gaining control over the bulk of the world's oil
reserves.''
   Rep. William S. Broomfield of Michigan, ranking Republican on
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the United States should
``make an example of Saddam Hussein.''
   ``It's important that other regional powers understand that the
world will not put up with naked aggression,'' Broomfield said in a
statement.

   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt today denied U.S. reports that
his country has agreed to send troops to join the multinational
force to defend Saudi Arabia and other threatened states in the
Middle East.
   Mubarak made the comment in a nationally televised speech in
which he did not rule out sending Egyptian troops as part of an
Arab force.
   Earlier today, Britain announced it would join the multinational
military effort to help prevent Iraq from expanding its invasion.
   U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, had said on Tuesday that Egypt and Morocco, close allies
of the United States, had agreed to send troops to join the
U.S.-led multinational force.
   But both countries today denied those reports.
   The question of Egypt's and Morocco's participation in the force
is important because Saudi Arabia reportedly has insisted that
other Arab nations join with the United States in sending troops to
counter Iraq.
   Egypt has a large arsenal of U.S.-supplied weapons and is the
second-largest recipient of U.S. economic and military aid _
currently receiving $2.3 billion a year. Since 1981 the United
States has conducted biannual joint maneuvers with Egypt.
   But Mubarak said intervention by foreign troops could worsen the
crisis, which began Thursday when tens of thousands of Iraqi troops
overran Kuwait, then massed along the Saudi border.
   ``We have no troops there (in Saudi Arabia). We are not
preparing troops and there is no talk about this,'' Mubarak said.
   ``But if we are asked to participate with Arab troops, I do not
think Egypt would refuse,'' he said.
   Mubarak called for an emergency Arab summit within 24 hours and
offered to hold it in Egypt. Shortly before Iraq invaded Kuwait,
Mubarak had tried to ease tensions between the two countries and
had thought he had succeeded.
   ``I call for an urgent Arab summit within 24 hours. It would be
better than having a solution forced on us by foreign powers,'' the
Egyptian leader said.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that Saudi Arabia,
Algeria, Libya, Tunis, Morocco, Jordan, Oman, Yemen and Syria had
agreed to attend the summit. There were no details on when the
proposed summit would be held.
   Mubarak said he had no personal knowledge that foreign powers
would strike Iraq but said he feared such an attack was coming.
   ``I have told our brothers in Iraq, I am afraid that Iraq will
be struck by a harsh strike from the outside. Don't think that the
fleets are just going to sit there sleeping,'' Mubarak said of
naval forces being sent to the region by the United States, France
and Britain.
   Morocco also indicated today that it was not willing to join the
multinational force. The official Moroccan news agency MAP quoted
an official source as saying, ``We deny all military
participation'' in the force.
   Morocco's King Hassan II receives millions of dollars a year in
U.S. military aid. The moderate Arab country has U.S.-made tanks.
   There was hope that a multinational defense of Saudi Arabia
would deter President Saddam Hussein's million-man Iraqi army from
crossing the border and seizing the kingdom's rich oil fields.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III made plans to meet Friday
in Brussels with the foreign ministers of the 15 U.S. allies in
Europe after a quick consultation trip to Turkey. The move appeared
to be an effort to enlist Western Europe in the Saudi defense
effort.
   The announcement by British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today
that Britain would participate in the multinational force followed
a conversation between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd.
   Hurd said the Saudis asked for British help, and Britain was in
contact with the United States and other allies on the best
contribution it could make.
   He said it was too soon to specify which forces Britain would
send, but he added: ``We are essentially talking about naval and
air forces.''
   Also today, Spain and Italy agreed to let the United States used
bases on their territory to help transport U.S. troops and
equipment sent to gulf.
   France has said it has not been asked to take part in the
multinational force and that participation was not ``envisaged at
this stage.''
   Turkey, which closed twin Iraqi oil pipelines to the
Mediterranean on Tuesday, also was not asked to join such a force,
said Turkey's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Murat Sungar.
   Bonn today signaled readiness to allow the U.S. military to use
American facilities in West Germany as a ``basis for operations''
for soldiers headed to Saudi Arabia to defend that nation against
Iraq.
   But the West German government said late Tuesday that there were
no plans for German troops to join the multinational force, noting
that the West German Constitution bars the use of German troops
outside the country.
   Taizo Watanabe, spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry,
also said his country's constitution would bar it from joining any
international military effort in the Persian Gulf.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney returned to Washington today after
visiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Morocco in a two-day trip to drum
up support for U.S. pressure on Iraq. He met with King Hassan in
Morocco on Tuesday.
   A handful of British and French navy vessels were also in the
region. A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said a Soviet
anti-submarine ship and destroyer were dispatched from the Indian
Ocean toward the area, but only to ``ensure safety of navigation of
Soviet civilian vessels.''
   Diplomats said the U.N. Security Council's resolution Monday
ordering an international trade embargo against Iraq could be used
as justification by the United States and other nations to act
unilaterally, or in concert apart from the United Nations, to
enforce the boycott.

   President Bush announced today that U.S.
troops were taking up ``defensive positions'' in oil-rich Saudi
Arabia to guard against a possible attack by Iraq. ``They will not
initiate hostilities but they will defend themselves,'' he said.
   At least 5,000 ground troops were involved, along with 140
sophisticated fighters and bombers and naval supply ships,
according to government sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Cruise missiles programmed to hit specific Iraqi sites
were aboard a battleship that set out on a week's journey to the
Middle East.
   In a televised Oval Office address, Bush sharply condemned Iraqi
aggression in invading Kuwait last week. He demanded ``immediate,
unconditional and complete'' withdrawal and the restoration of the
Kuwaiti government to power.
   The president conceded that the Saudi defense mission ``may take
time and be costly'' and said he would consider tapping the
nation's strategic petroleum reserves to assure a ready supply of
oil. He called on the oil companies not to engage in unnecessary
price hikes to take advantage of the international uncertainty and
urged that other oil-producing nations boost production.
   Bush committed American forces as the second part of an
international effort to force an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The
United Nations voted earlier in the week to impose a complete trade
embargo against Iraq, and Bush and other world leaders have been
considering how to implement the sanctions, including a possible
naval blockade.
   Bush described the make-shift Saudi defense force as a
``multi-national'' one, but he did not identify the participants
and there was considerable confusion about its makeup. Egypt and
Morocco denied they were involved.
   The reaction from Iraq was defiant. State television declared
that ``history has proved that Kuwait is a part of Iraq.''
   One Pentagon official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the nation's military leadership was settling in for what
could be a lengthy operation.
   ``This whole thing isn't easy. You don't deploy forces and they
suddenly show up in another part of the world. There are a hell of
a lot of logistical problems that go into moving people around the
world, particularly in the extreme conditions of the Middle East,''
he said.
   Members of Congress offered immediate backing for the
president's moves. Said House Speaker Thomas Foley, ``I think the
people and the Congress will support him.''
   Expressions of concern blended with support. Democratic Rep. Les
Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the
nation was in for ``a couple of very, very tense days.''
   The president provided no estimate of the number of troops
involved in the Saudi deployment _ deliberately so, according to
Pentagon sources who said Bush did not want to tip off Iraq.
   U.S. sources had said Eqypt and Morocco would participate in the
multi-national force, but only Britain said it would take part.
   ``We have no troops there,'' said Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak. ``We are not preparing troops and there is no talk about
this. But if we are asked to participate with Arab troops, I do not
think Egypt would refuse.
   The USS Wisconsin departed Tuesday night on a week-long voyage
for the Mediterranean Sea, armed with 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles
programmed with targeting information about specific Iraqi
positions, the sources said.
   It would escort the carrier Saratoga to the Mediterranean. Two
other carriers are in the region, along with their escort ships.
   The president continued his diplomatic maneuvers as the military
deployment unfolded.
   White House officials said Bush was meeting during the day with
Kuwait's ambassador in a gesture that reflected continuing American
support for the exiled Kuwaiti government.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker was departing for Turkey and a
later visit to Brussels for a meeting with NATO leaders on Friday.
Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Turkey was seeking
compensation of as much as $2 billion in exchange for shutting down
the Iraqi oil pipeline that crosses its territory.
   ``There is no justification whatsoever for this outrageous and
brutal act of aggression,'' Bush said of Iraq and its leader,
Saddam Hussein, a man he described as ``an aggressive dictator
threatening his neighbors.''
   ``A puppet regime imposed from the outside is unacceptable. The
acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable. No one, friend
or foe, should doubt our desire for peace, and no one should
underestimate our determination to confront aggression.''
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition of not being
identified, said Army units heading for Saudi Arabia included
elements of the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, N.C.; the
24th Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga., and the 101st
Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky. The 82nd and the 101st
make up the 18th Airborne Corps.
   As well, several Marine supply ships based at the super-secret
U.S. facility on the island of Diego Garcia have set sail for the
region, the sources said.
   ``This first movement is of light infantry and airborne troops.
But these ships have the heavy tanks, M1-A1 Abrams and M-60s, that
are needed for heavy-duty ground fighting,'' the source said.
   The source said the Tomahawk cruise missiles would overmatch the
French-made Exocet missiles that Iraq has used so successfully in
other conflicts.
   Sources said Navy supply ships have departed Guam, the strategic
Pacific Island base manned with 8,000 U.S. airmen and sailors, for
the Arabian Sea to back up the Independence and the Eisenhower
carriers.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on Iraq-Kuwait:
   Let us hope that anyone who believes history ended with the
decline of the Cold War is aware of the Iraqui invasion of Kuwait.
   This remarkable event has come as a shock, but no surprise:
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had been hinting about such action
for some time, and had bullied Kuwait with the threat of force at
the recent OPEC conference in Geneva. ...
   President Bush has vowed that the United States will ``take
whatever steps necessary'' to defend American interests in the
Persian Gulf. ...
   We take President Bush's comments to mean that oil supplies to
the West will not be interrupted _ and we trust that he will not
hesitate to guarantee those supplies. If this means a resumption of
our earlier policy of reflagging and escorting tankers in danger,
then that earlier policy should be swiftly resurrected.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on Iraq-Kuwait:
   Iraq has a huge army, massive debts and ambitions that are out
of proportion to its size. At its doorstep lies Kuwait, a virtually
undefended country with $2 trillion worth of oil. In retrospect,
it's surprising that Iraq waited until now to grab its rich little
neighbor. ...
   Iraq's invasion has also confirmed that its president, Saddam
Hussein, is one of the world's most dangerous men. Under his
leadership Iraq has launched an eight-year war against Iran, used
chemical weapons more extensively than any nation since World War
I, attempted to buy nuclear weapons triggers on the international
black market, and threatened Israel with annihilation.
   Now, with Kuwait's resources at his disposal, Hussein controls
20 percent of the output of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, putting him in a position to cause economic mischief on
a global scale.
   Iraq must be forced back within its borders, but armed force _
particularly American military intervention _ should not be the
instrument. The United States does not have enough at stake to
justify a war with Iraq over Kuwait. ...
   Hussein is undeterred by world opinion. He will, however,
respond to economic pressure. ...
   President Bush has already cut off trade with Iraq, frozen Iraqi
funds and protected Kuwaiti assets in the U.S. from Iraqi seizure.
Other countries should respond with sanctions of their own. The
Soviet Union and France, Iraq's two main suppliers of military
equipment, have a special responsibility to end arms shipments.
Japan and Western Europe, the main consumers of Iraqi oil, should
seek supplies elsewhere. Oil exporters in the Mideast and elsewhere
should increase production to facilitate the boycott.

   Orange Coast Daily Pilot, Costa Mesa, Calif., on Iraq-Kuwait:
   It's time to act like a superpower.
   The United States needs to use its military force to dislodge
Iraq from its occupation of Kuwait and to cripple the million-man,
renegade Iraqi army.
   The reason is simple: other methods of retaliation are too
risky. From all accounts, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is the Hitler
of the 1990s, the Butcher of Baghdad, a madman who wants to rule
the Middle East.
   If we put an international economic knife to Hussein's throat,
he might lash out in defense. Remember, this is a man who has built
a Third World country into a first-rate military power, liberally
used chemical weapons in his war with Iran and, some analysts fear,
may have a nuclear surprise up his sleeve.
   Why sweat an outlaw like this?
   The United States has spent $300 billion per year to build up
its military; let's put it to use. ... As Iraqi troops sit just
miles from the Saudi Arabia border, the time for the U.S. to draw
the line has passed. Hussein obliterated the line as soon as his
army crossed the border of Kuwait.
   The world community has unanimously condemned Iraq for its
lightning takeover of Kuwait. We encourage the United States to
lead the world and bring this outlaw country to justice.

   The Brainerd (Minn.) Daily Dispatch on Justice Marshall:
   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall (made) malicious
comments concerning President Bush's nomination of David Souter to
replace Justice William Brennan on the court.
   In an interview on ABC television, the 82-year-old justice
scoffed at Souter as a nobody who couldn't hope to fill the shoes
of Brennan, an esteemed liberal.
   But Marshall's pique didn't end there. He also blasted the
president. ``It's said that, if you can't say something good about
a dead person, don't say it,'' Marshall said of Bush. ``Well, I
consider him dead.''
   This statement is not only shockingly rude but also totally
inappropriate from the mouth of a supposedly dignified Supreme
Court justice. The fact that he has a lifetime appointment and is
largely insulated from public scrutiny doesn't excuse such
callousness.

   Athens (Ohio) Messenger on S&amp;Ls and student loans:
   The savings and loan scandal is actually having one beneficial
side-effect: It is making Washington nervous about the federal
government's vast and miscellaneous liabilities.
   Federal insurance on thrift deposits is the reason the public
must pick up the tab for hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls around the
country. The cost to the taxpayers: $300 billion over 30 years.
   But deposit insurance is only one form of public guarantee.
Numerous other programs shift risk and potential losses from
private parties to the citizens at large. The administration is
starting to take a close look at the public's exposure in areas
like home mortgages, farm credit _ and that perennial invitation to
abuse, student loans.
   Federally guaranteed student loans worth $13 billion will be
made this year. Those loans help millions of young people pay for
college or vocational training. Unfortunately, they also line the
pockets of con artists who set up fly-by-night trade schools that
exploit unsophisticated, often semiliterate clients and feed off
federal loans.
   The default rate, just 9 percent at four-year colleges, averages
40 percent at for-profit trade schools. Loan deadbeats are costing
taxpayers $2 billion this year. ...
   Together, these agencies will have more than $1 trillion in
liabilities outstanding by 1991. The taxpayers, reeling from the
savings and loan bailout, have a right to insist that these
enterprises be financially sound.

<HEAD>Study Says Kids Shouldn't Ride in Backs of Pickups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Children riding in the back of pickup trucks risk
severe injury and death even if the vehicle is not involved in a
crash, researchers report.
   The study in today's Journal of the American Medical Association
examined data on 290 children up to age 14 who had been injured or
killed in pickups from 1980 to 1989 in Orange County, Calif.
   The researchers found that 24 percent of those injured in the
back of the truck were hurt in non-crash events _ such as a sudden
stop or turn _ compared with 9 percent of those in the cab.
   And 47 percent of the children riding in the back were injured
when ejected from the vehicle, while only 11 percent of those
riding inside were ejected, the researchers said.
   ``The ultimate goal should be a legislative intervention
eliminating travel in the back of a pickup truck where no
opportunity for restraint exists,'' wrote the authors, led by Dr.
Phyllis F. Agran of the University of California at Irvine's
pediatrics department.
   ``It goes against every principle of child safety that you could
imagine,'' said Dr. Mark Widome, chairman of the American Academy
of Pediatrics' Committee on Injury and Poison Prevention.
   The authors noted that National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration statistics show that in 1987, 127 children under age
20 were killed nationwide while riding in the back of pickups.
About 1,000 children were injured in such instances that same year,
the authors said.
   In 1989, 103 youths aged 21 and under died while riding in
pickup beds, federal statistics show.
   Only eight states have measures restricting travel in the back
of pickups, said the study's authors.

<HEAD>Antibiotics Head Off Urinary Tract Infections In Women After Sex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking a tablet containing antibiotics after sex
can give women who suffer frequent urinary tract infections a
reprieve from that common and frustrating problem, researchers
report.
   Such an approach is better than taking the same antibiotics
daily or three times a week to prevent infections, since continual
antibiotic therapy can be costly and can promote
antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the researchers reported in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The drugs they used in a new study _ trimethoprim and
sulfamethoxazole, marketed in combination under the trade names
Bactrim and Septra _ seem to work regardless of how often a woman
has sex, the researchers said.
   The drugs also are highly effective in women who use diaphragms
for contraception, an important finding since diaphragms have been
blamed for contributing to urinary tract infections in sexually
active young women.
   The researchers compared 16 infection-prone women who took the
antibiotics after sex with 11 similar women who were given an inert
drug. The women were an average of 23 years old, and each had
suffered at least two urinary tract infections in the previous year.
   Only two of the 16 women taking antibiotics developed infections
during the 180 days of the study, compared with nine of the women
taking placebos. The researchers were led by Dr. Ann Stapleton of
the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
   The infection rate in study subjects who took antibiotics after
sex _ 0.3 per patient-year _ compares favorably with rates reported
previously for patients who took the same drugs daily or three
times per week _ zero to 0.15 infections per patient-year, the
researchers said.
   Taking antibiotics after intercourse is something many
physicians already prescribe for such women, but the Seattle study
is the first scientific support for the strategy.
   ``It is an important study, even though the idea is not new,''
Dr. Arieh Bergman, chief of gynecology and urology at the
University of Southern California Women's Hospital, said in a
telephone interview Tuesday from Los Angeles.

   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Iraq-Kuwait:
   There are mounting international calls for economic sanctions
against Iraq as a result of its invasion of Kuwait. ... More than
anything else, we wish to see the conflict resolved in the United
Nations from the standpoint of the Kuwaitis whose country has been
invaded.
   There were not a few cases where economic sanctions invoked in
the Cold war years tended to become half-baked and did not function
in an effective manner. Given this tendency, Japan used to be
rather passive on economic sanctions. ...
   Having an increasingly bigger say in the world community, Japan
ought to extricate itself from its conventional passive posture of
following other countries and act positively so that economic
sanctions against Iraq may be effective. ...
   The best option for making economic sanctions effective is to
respond to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti situation in an imperturbable manner,
instead of being carried away by immediate market trends.

raise its voice a bit louder and make it heard by the masses
calling for law and justice? ...
   It must be admitted that Iraq has committed this very unjust
action extremely successfully and gotten the highest grade. ...
Neither the CIA, nor the KGB nor anyone else had the slightest idea
of what was going to happen. (But Iraq) may get used to that. ...

   Sovetskaya Rossiya, Moscow, on Iraq-Kuwait:
   The conflict in relations between Iraq and Kuwait erupted more
than a fortnight ago when Baghdad accused Kuwait authorities of
exceeding OPEC production quotas and thereby bringing down world
prices of oil and harming the Iraqi economy. ...
   But the roots of this bloody conflict go much deeper. They lie
in the hegemonistic nature of the Iraqi leadership's foreign policy
over the past decade.
   Tensions in the Persian Gulf continue unabated. This, as the
Soviet government justly said in its statement, is directly at odds
with the interests of Arab countries, means extra obstacles to
settling conflicts in the Middle East, and runs counter to positive
trends of recovery in the international economy.

   The Guardian, London, on Iraq-Kuwait:
   Frustration in the Gulf leads temptingly to the invocation of
task forces and tactical bombing, but the military option is no
option at all. The emergence of a potential hostage problem of vast
dimensisons only emphasized that this is far too vast a crisis for
gunboat diplomacy. Loose talk of ``carpet-bombing'' Baghdad should
be put back in the bottle of theoretical but unacceptable
scenarios. ...
   For the West to use force now would only compound its enormous
historical error which has allowed the monster we helped create to
thrive. ... Nothing would do more to convince the Arab world that
Saddam Husseein is the Nasser of the '90s. And nothing would more
quickly undermine the new harmony of the post-cold war world than
unilateral action by the United States and its allies.

   Straits Times, Singapore, on Trinidad and Tobago:
   The coup attempt (in Trinidad and Tobago) is to some extent a
manifestation of a nation's unhappiness with grinding poverty and a
worsening economy. ... Exploiting this, the rebels claimed that
they staged the coup because of government corruption and austerity
measures. Whether or not they are to be believed, corruption at the
highest level and further economic pain through austere _ and
necessary _ measures are the ingredients that could turn a
contented people against their government. ...
   What made matters worse in Trinidad and Tobago was that the
frustration also took on a religious and racial slant. Moslems,
mainly converts, form six percent of a population which is
predominantly Christian. ...
   Another sinister aspect of this highly combustible situation was
the allegation that some of the rebels were trained in Libya,
dubbed by many Western governments as a sponsor of terrorism. If
Libya did indeed help pull the trigger, then clearly Trinidad's
troubles have far wider implications, especially for small
countries who suffer from a triple dosage of economic woes and a
racial minority which is also a religious minority.

   Jakarta (Indonesia) Post on normalizing relations between China
and Indonesia:
   As we begin to conduct full diplomatic relations with China in
the continuously changing setting of the Asia-Pacific region,
therefore, we must from the outset have a clear vision and retain
concrete ideas of what the actual purposes of maintaining such
relations are. ...
   Although we will be developing our bilateral relations with
China on different levels _ trade, culture, sports, science and
technology and so forth _we should prevent ourselves from
developing sentimental views that could fog our clear view on the
aspirations of China as a major Asian power.
   That is why it is important to convey to China, in no uncertain
terms and precisely at this initial stage of normal diplomatic
relations, that the efforts to restore peace in Cambodia have by
now become a crucial test case of whether it has the intention of
playing a constructive role in Southeast Asia.
   Certainly the majority of countries in the world, as well as we
in Indonesia, find it difficult to understand how a major power
such as China ... persists in using such a despicable group as the
Khmer Rouge as its policy instrument on mainland Southeast Asia. ...
   In that fundamental sense, the resumption of normal diplomatic
relations between ... Indonesia and ... China could have a
beneficial impact on the stability and the dynamic development of
East Asia.

   Trouw, Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Liberia:
   The end of the Liberian president, Samuel Doe, is near, although
he himself doesn't seem to think so. With a few hundred faithful
followers he has barricaded himself in his palace in the besieged
capital, Monrovia, and feels strengthened by his belief in
``juju,'' the magic powers that should make him invincible. ...
   Doe did not turn out to be the champion of emancipation of
suppressed ``natives.'' He established a new ethnic supremacy, of
his Krahn tribe over other ethnic groups. Under his corrupt rule
the country was impoverished.
   But the Americans stayed. They had economic interests (rubber),
maintained the radio station Voice of America and an important
military communication center, and the Monrovian airport was of
military significance.
   It would be nonsense to say that the Americans bear guilt for
the current violence in Liberia. But Washington could have
protested earlier against Doe's misbehavior, and it could have
thrown in its economic and political power. ...
   Now the European Community and the United States have distanced
themselves from the violence of Doe, and from the rebels who are
fighting him. ...
   Not siding with the rebels is nice. ...
   But waiting (until) things get better is the worst position
possible. Tens of thousands of refugees are floating into the Ivory
Coast and other poverty-stricken neighboring countries. Help has to
be given there. Efforts of West-African countries to mediate in
order to break through this deadlock merit support. ...
   However, the most important thing is that it is made clear to
the ``victors'' in this horrible conflict, from the start and in
every possible way, that human politics pay and draconian politics
do not.

   The American Bar Association's policymaking body
today withdrew its formal support of abortion rights, heeding a
plea from a majority of members who took part in an earlier forum
here.
   The ABA's House of Delegates, by a vote of 200-188, approved a
so-called neutrality proposal to repeal its ``pro-choice'' policy
adopted in February.
   The vote followed nearly two ours of spirited, at times
impassioned debate over an issue that has divided the nation's
largest lawyers' group as have few issues in its history.
   Supporters of the pro-choice stance vowed to fight on and said
future ABA conventions could be dominated by the abortion issue.
   ``Nobody here has the illusion we're going to put our tails
between our legs and go home,'' said Estelle Rogers of Washington,
D.C., a leader of those who wanted the ABA to remain on record in
support of abortion rights.
   Anthony Palermo of Rochester, N.Y., who led the drive for
repeal, said he hoped the matter now is resolved. ``It would be a
grave mistake if we kept dominating each meeting with this issue,''
he told reporters.
   During the debate among the delegates, Sally Determan of
Washington, D.C., urged rejection of the repeal resolution.
Adopting it, she said, would send a signal the ABA was abandoning
its support of ``women's right to choose, to control our own
bodies'' and was bowing to a well-financed campaign by a vocal
minority.
   Barbara Howard of Cincinnati said she supported the repeal
proposal because views on abortion reflect deeply held individual
religious and moral beliefs.
   ``Abortion is not a legal issue,'' she said. ``It's a political
issue, a moral issue.''
   Lawyers attending the ABA's Assembly on Monday voted 885-836 to
urge the delegates to rescind the February policy. Abortion
opponents joined forces with those who support neutrality to
narrowly approve the recommendation.
   Neither side said it had any plans for a referendum on the issue
among all 360,000 ABA members nationwide.
   The split within the ABA was underscored by two speakers today,
its new president, John J. Curtin Jr. of Boston, and his designated
successor, Sandy D'Alemberte of Tallahassee, Fla.
   Curtin urged repeal. D'Alemberte pleaded with his colleagues to
stand fast behind the pro-choice policy, which he said defends
``the principle of liberty.''
   ``I am forced to ally myself with one set of friends against
another,'' Curtin said.
   On Tuesday, he told a news conference the issue has caused
wounds within the ABA he hopes to help heal.
   Regardless of the outcome of today's debate, Curtin said,
``There will be some disappointed people and I'll speak to the
healing process. We're not a single-issue organization.''
   Curtin had said he would refuse to sign any legal briefs in
which the ABA advocates abortion rights if the pro-choice stance
were retained.
   Palermo, in urging repeal of the February policy, said, ``If
current policy is not altered, the ABA will be accurately portrayed
as an advocate of one extreme position in the debate, thus
forfeiting its potential role as a constructive arbiter of the
debate.''
   Monday's Assembly: 12th graf pvs.
   Monday's Assembly vote was open to any of the 12,000 association
members attending this week's annual convention who paid a $250
registration fee.
   The resolution adopted by the House of Delegates in February
said government should not interfere ``with the confidential
relationship between a pregnant woman and her physician'' in
deciding on abortions.
   The policy prompted criticism by some who said it creates an
impression the ABA may be biased when it decides whether to support
judicial nominees.
   But Curtin said Tuesday that the ABA will continue to evaluate
judicial appointees, including Supreme Court nominee David H.
Souter, based on competence, integrity and judicial temperament.
   More than 1,500 members have quit the ABA since February in
protest over the pro-choice stance, costing the association about
$300,000 in annual fees.

   Here are some of Wednesday's quotes on the Iraq-Kuwait crisis:
   
   ``I want to be clear about what we are doing and why. America
does not seek conflict, nor do we seek to chart the destiny of
other nations. But America will stand by her friend. The mission of
our troops is wholly defensive. Hopefully, they will not be needed
long. They will not initiate hostilities, but they will defend
themselves, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other friends in the
Persian Gulf.'' _ President George Bush.

   ``We have no troops there (in Saudi Arabia). We are not
preparing troops and there is no talk about this. But if we are
asked to participate with Arab troops, I do not think Egypt would
refuse.'' _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

principles of honor, to go with their heroic leader, Saddam
Hussein.'' _ From a statement read on Iraqi radio.

   East German soldiers will no longer march the
goose step because it is out of step with the country's new
democratic ways, East Germany's defense minister announced
Wednesday.
   The goose step, widely linked to Germany's militaristic past, no
longer fits the armed forces' image, Defense Minister Rainer
Eppelmann said, according to the ADN news agency.
   The goose step was a trademark of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
After Germany was divided, the West dropped the goose step, but the
East retained it.

   A heroin addict and who is infected
with the AIDS virus was convicted Wednesday of attempting to hold
up a jewelry store with an infected syringe.
   The Lugano jury court found the 28-year-old Italian guilty of
armed robbery and sentenced him to three years in prison. He was
also barred from Switzerland for 15 years.
   The defendant's name was not given as is custom for first
offenders in Switzerland.
   He threatened to stab the saleswoman of a store at Ponmte Tresa,
near the Italian border, with the infected syringe.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. One way in
which it is spread is through needles or syringes shared by drug
abusers.

<TEXT>
   Showers fell in the parched Tokyo area Wednesday,
the first measurable precipitation in nearly four weeks, but the
rain missed the city's dwindling water source in the northern
mountains, weather officials said.
   The capital's Waterworks Bureau said the city of 12 million
people has enough water for only 15 days.
   A hot, dry summer has left seven reservoirs serving the capital
and part of five surrounding states at just 25 percent of capacity.
   The 4.8 million households in Tokyo have been urged to cut their
water use by 10 percent. The water bureau said it will have to ask
residents to further cut their water use if the situation worsens.
   The water bureau said the water shortage was the worst since the
long drought in the summer of 1987.
   A high pressure system touched off intermittent showers in the
Tokyo area, dropping up to 2.8 inches of rain Wednesday. It was the
first rain in Tokyo to amount to more than 0.4 inches since July 13.

<TEXT>
   Family and friends of three defendants in the
Central Park jogger case walked out of the courtroom this morning
as a prosecutor told the jury the teens were guilty of raping and
nearly killing the woman.
   The closing argument by Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth
Lederer was interrupted about 10 minutes after it began when a
dozen of the defendants' supporters stood up and left.
   Lederer continued speaking, imploring the jury to convict Yusef
Salaam, 16, Raymond Santana, 15, and Antron McCray, 16, in the
April 19, 1989, brutalization of the jogger during a gang rampage
through Central Park.
   ``These three youths had gone into the park ... with 30 or more
people. They went to rob people, to beat people, and to assault
people. And that is what they did. They robbed, beat and assaulted
anyone they could catch,'' Lederer said.
   Lederer made reference to the courtroom appearance of the woman
who authorities said was beaten, bludgeoned, raped and left for
dead by her assailants.
   ``The fact that she could even come to this courtroom is a
miracle. ... (The jogger) will never be the same as she was,''
Lederer said.
   The jury was expected to begin deliberations later today.
   Defense lawyers made their final appeals to the jury on Tuesday,
with one attorney suggesting the victim was not gang-raped and
others accusing detectives of lying about how admissions were
obtained from the three defendants.
   Robert Burns, lawyer for Salaam, said in closing statements that
unanswered questions raise doubts about whether she was raped.
   ``Nobody in his right mind would dispute the seriousness of her
injuries,'' said Burns, ``but this brave young lady did not, and
cannot, shed any light on what happened to her on April 19, 1989.''
   Burns said semen found inside the jogger's body did not match
that of the three defendants, her boyfriend or any person known to
prosecutors.
   ``How can one conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the sperm
found inside her arose out of the criminal assault?'' Burns asked.
   Salaam, Santana and McCray are accused of raping and nearly
killing the jogger and assaulting two male runners in the north end
of Central Park.
   They are on trial in state Supreme Court in Manhattan on charges
of attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, riot, assault and robbery.
   The 30-year-old woman is back at work as a vice president at
Salomon Brothers investment bankers, but she testified that she
still suffers from impaired sight, balance and smell as a result of
the attack.
   The principal evidence against McCray and Santana are statements
they gave police. Salaam did not give police a statement but a
detective testified he took notes of admissions Salaam made during
questioning.
   All the lawyers said police lied on the witness stand about how
the admissions were obtained.
   Michael Joseph, McCray's lawyer, charged that detectives used
threats and promises to extract statements from his client.
   Peter Rivera, Santana's lawyer, told the jury, ``Raymond was not
involved in any way, shape or form in the events he confessed to.''
   Burns also criticized prosecutors for putting the jogger on the
stand and for showing the jury color photographs of her injuries.
   ``I believe the district attorney has made an attempt to appeal
to your emotions,'' Burns told the jury. ``When the prosecutor
waves all those ghastly pictures at you, those are attempts to
catapult you into a spirit of vengeance.''

<HEAD>With AM-Iraq-Kuwait Rdp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait:
   July 17 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices
down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.
He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are
conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's
economy and undermine its military buildup.
   July 18 _ Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of
oil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking
to wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down
prices.
   July 20 _ Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of
belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _ including Kuwait _
to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
   July 24 _ The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy
warships and aircraft are holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in
the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles
southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait reinstates a state of
alert it declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tension
between the two oil-producing countries.
   July 25 _ The Iraqi government says that it will not be
intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring
Kuwait, and Saddam summons the U.S. ambassador for talks. President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet in Saudi
Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute.
   July 26 _ OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproduction
in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates pledge to abide by the agreement. Analysts say
Saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the meetings.
   July 31 _ Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations meet in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, to negotiate the oil and border dispute. Diplomats say Iraq
has massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple the
number originally estimated. That number dwarfs the Kuwaiti army,
which has a total of about 20,000 troops.
   Aug. 1 _ Iraq pulls out of talks on the 2-week-old border, oil
and money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends its forces to
invade the oil-rich sheikdom.
   Aug. 2 _ Iraq's army overruns Kuwait before dawn; tank-led
troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and other government
buildings.
   Aug. 3 _ Shelling and gunfire shakes portions of Kuwait's
capital, indicating a last-ditch attempt by Kuwaiti forces to hold
out against the Iraqis. Iraqi troops push to within 5 to 10 miles
of the Saudi Arabian border. The State department also said 14
Americans are now known to be missing in Kuwait and are believed to
be in Iraqi hands.
   Aug. 4 _ Baghdad announces a new military government for
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The 12-member European Community imposes an
embargo against imports of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil. It also bans
exports of weapons to Iraq, suspends that country's preferential
trade status and freezes Iraqi assets.
   Aug. 5 _ Kuwait's new Iraqi-installed government claims that
Iraqi troops begin pulling out of Kuwait; the United States says it
doubts withdrawal is really under way.
   Aug. 6 _ The U.N. Security Council orders worldwide embargo on
trade with Iraq to punish that nation for its invasion of Kuwait.
In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other
U.S. military leaders confer with Saudi leaders about how to defend
the oil kingdom against any attack by Iraq.
   Aug. 7 _ President Bush orders the deployment of U.S. combat
troops and warplanes to Saudi Arabia; a U.S. Navy task force sets
sail for the region. Turkey shuts down the Iraqi pipeline to the
Mediterranean, honoring a U.N. trade embargo.
   Aug. 8 _ Iraq declares that Kuwait is part of Iraq and calls on
Iraqis to rally behind President Saddam Hussein. Britain agrees to
join a multinational force in the Persian Gulf.

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Wednesday on the Iraq crisis:
   Bush: Terry?
   Q: Mr. President, how many American troops have you sent to
Saudi Arabia? How long are you committed to keeping them there? And
why not use them to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait?
   Bush: There will be a military briefing at the Pentagon, I think
it's within an hour, and so I will leave the numbers to them. I
would expect there would be some reluctance to give out specific
numbers at this point for very obvious reasons. What was the last
part of your _
   Q: The other parts, sir, were how long will you keep American
forces in Saudi Arabia, and why not use them to drive the Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait?
   Bush: Well, as you know from what I said, they're there in a
defensive mode right now. And therefore, that is not the mission,
to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait. We have economic sanctions that
I hope will be effective to that end, and I don't know how long
they'll be there. They just got there _ are just getting there.
   Q: Is this an open-ended commitment? I mean, could this drag on
for years?
   Bush: Nothing is open-ended, but I'm not worrying about that
there at all; I'm worrying about getting them there and doing what
I indicated in our speech in there is necessary: the defense of the
Saudis and the trying, through concerted international means, to
reverse out this aggression.
   Q: Mr. President, are we in a war? And what other nations have
agreed to join our forces in defending Saudi Arabia? And I take it
you also have included other Gulf nations in that umbrella.
   Bush: We're not in a war. We have sent forces to defend Saudi
Arabia. Other nations _ I will leave announcements about what other
nations will be participating to the Saudis. But I believe Margaret
Thatcher, after talking to King Fahd, has announced that forces
will be going in, and then I think you'll see other such actions,
but I'd much prefer to leave that to Saudi Arabia, who _ indeed,
it's their country.
   Q: But was Cheney's mission successful in rallying support with
Egypt and Morocco?
   Bush: Well, I _ I, having talked to Mubarak a couple of times
myself, feel that we are in very close agreement with him. Who was
your other country you asked about?
   Q: Morocco, Yemen.
   Bush: Morocco _ very, very supportive of the Saudis and of our
overall position on the Mideast. So, they're _ I was very pleased
with the Cheney mission in that regard. Brit?
   Q: Mr. President, there are several dozen Americans in Baghdad
apparently not able to leave (inaudible) and perhaps hundreds more
in Kuwait, and perhaps elsewhere in Iraq as well. In view of the
extreme political sensitivity of Americans toward this whole
question of hostages, why should not Saddam Hussein feel that he
holds very high cards now in dealing with the United States?
   Bush: Well, I've been encouraged that there had been _ have been
actually announcements, I believe, saying people were free to
leave. So I'm not going to speculate or hypothecate beyond that. I
want to see them out of there obviously. But what he does, that's a
bit unpredictable. But I'm not going to heighten tensions in this
regard by responding to hypothetical questions that might go beyond
your question.
   Q: Well, what _ I just wonder what assurances you might be able
to provide so that our policy in this instance will not become, as
it has in the past, hostage-driven?

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Prince Johnson today freed
foreign hostages his forces had kidnapped to provoke international
intervention in Liberia's bloody civil war.
   The British Foreign Office said Johnson released all the
hostages seized Monday and Tuesday, but said it was unclear how
many people were freed.
   On Tuesday, Johnson had presented 22 hostages from eight
countries to reporters at a news conference.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said Britain was waiting
for the hostages to come to Monrovia from the nearby town of
Caldwell, where they were being held.
   Only eight of the hostages have been identified. They are an
American, an Argentinian, three Britons, a Dutchman and two West
Germans. A fourth Briton has been freed but not identified. In
Beirut, an official said 10 Lebanese were among those kidnapped.
   The American hostage was identified as Chris Mende, 27, a mining
contractor from Sacramento, Calif.
   U.S. Marines were airlifted into Monrovia on Sunday, one day
after Johnson threatened to begin rounding up foreigners in an
effort to force foreign powers to intervene and end the civil war.
The Marines evacuated Americans and other foreigners and took up
defensive positions within the walled U.S. Embassy compound.
   Neighboring West African nations agreed Tuesday to send troops
to stop the civil war. Diplomats based in Sierra Leone, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said 2,000 West African troops will soon
be sent by sea to Monrovia from Freetown, Sierra Leone. Most of the
troops would be from Nigeria. Earlier reports had said Nigeria was
planning to airlift 500 soldiers to Monrovia.
   Johnson had said the hostages would not be freed until the
United States or West African nations intervene militarily to halt
the 7-month civl war to oust President Samuel Doe.
   Johnson said his forces would attack the Marines if no troops
came. Some 5,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the
civil war.
   ``What this country really needs is the peaceful intervention of
the United States'' or other African nations, said Johnson. ``If
they don't intervene I will attack the American Marines.''
   Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida said today the peacekeeping
troops would be deployed soon in Monrovia. Babangida said he hoped
they would meet no resistance but added that they would be prepared
to impose a truce if necessary.
   Street battles continued to rage in the Liberian capital, where
rival rebel armies loyal to Johnson and former bureaucrat Charles
Taylor are fighting each other and soldiers of the beleaguered Doe,
who remains holed up in his fortified mansion. Heavy fighting also
broke out near the U.S. Embassy.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Marines
will protect the embassy and ``will do that with force if
necessary.''
   The State Department said the U.S. Embassy has taken steps to
evacuate all Americans who can reach the embassy in Monrovia. The
U.S. government also has agreed to evacuate some other foreign
nationals.
   Ms. Tutwiler said a representative of Johnson's group had
informed U.S. officials on Tuesday that the hostages were all well
and would not be harmed.
   The Economic Community of West African States, meeting in
Banjul, Gambia, did not say when the soldiers would go to Liberia.
   The West African leaders said in a communique at the end of
their two-day summit Tuesday that a five-nation group led by a
Ghanaian commander would go to Liberia. The other nations sending
troops are Guinea, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
   The West African force would impose a cease-fire that would
allow the establishment of a broad-based interim government charged
with organizing free and fair elections, the announcement said.
   None of the warring parties would be permitted to participate in
the interim government. No members of the interim government would
be allowed to stand for election, the communique said.
   The beleagured Doe, who has repeatedly called for international
intervention, welcomed the West African initiative in a telephone
call Tuesday to the British Broadcasting Corp.
   The West African have asked the international community to help
pay the cost of the operation and elections estimated at $50
million.

   Some things never change. A 1904 letter
found at the University of Montevallo sounded two familiar themes
of parent-child correspondence: money and letters.
   The letter was found by a remodeler under a window molding in
the Main Hall basement, which was once a cafeteria.
   The letter was in its original envelope, addressed to Clyde
Merrill, a student at the university in the early 1900s. Bill
Plott, UM's director of information services, said the letter was
from Miss Merrill's father, J.B. Merrill of Edwardsville.
   In his closing remarks, Merrill wrote: ``I will send check in
day or two. Will carry my check book with me ... P.S. write to your
ma.''
   Ed Booth, a history buff who owns Central Construction, was
thrilled with his find.
   ``I have a collection of arrowheads that I've found on
construction sites before, but never anything like this,'' said
Booth.

   Sunbathers wearing a boa that isn't
made of feathers are subject to a ticket.
   The City Commission passed a law Tuesday prohibiting boa
constrictors and all other reptiles on city beaches.
   Another ordinance barring animals didn't include cold-blooded
creatures such as snakes or lizards.
   ``We've had several people try to bring boa constrictors to the
beach and when they were asked to leave, they argued that a reptile
isn't an animal,'' said Lt. Matthew McShane.
   ``It's younger guys using snakes as a come-on for girls _ a
`look at me' kind of thing,'' the police officer said.
   ``The people were asked to leave but we can't enforce a law that
doesn't exist. We didn't anticipate this problem when the original
ordinance was passed,'' said Mayor Marvin Frederich.
   Frederich said the slithery creatures go to the beach wrapped
around their owner's neck or arm.
   ``What's a police officer supposed to do _ cuff them over the
snake?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Mayor's Mansion Going Against Water Conservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most city residents are going along with the
mayor's call for water conservation because of a drought, but water
use is way up at the mayor's official residence.
   Mayor Tom Bradley has lobbied for a mandatory water conservation
program that would impose rationing if residents fail to reduce
their consumption by 10 percent below 1986 levels.
   By that standard, the mayor's official residence, Getty House,
passes muster. During June and July, water use at Bradley's
residence was 26 percent below 1986 levels, although in April and
May, the decrease was less than 1 percent, according to Department
of Water and Power records.
   But compared to last year, the faucets at Getty House are
gushing.
   Water consumption from April through July at Getty House was an
average 2,079 gallons per day, up nearly 27.5 percent over the same
period last year, according to the records cited by the Daily News
of Los Angeles.
   City residents cut their water use by 9.5 percent over the same
period last year, the newspaper reported Wednesday.
   A Bradley spokesman blamed unseasonably high temperatures this
year and more official receptions at the residence.
   ``The mayor held three times as many receptions this year than
he did during the same four months last year,'' Bill Chandler said.
``If you know how much water is used at a reception with a hundred
people, it's clear where much of the water went.''
   City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, chairwoman of a council
committee on water issues, said the Getty House water bill could
dampen the mayor's credibility on conservation matters.
   ``People look to public officials for good examples,'' Flores
said.
   The City Council rejected Bradley's conservation proposal last
month in favor of a voluntary plan.

   Bush: I can provide only the assurance that I consider the
protection of American life fundamental to my job and
responsibilities as president. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, the question of chemical weapons. There are
reports that the Iraqis were seen loading airplanes with chemical
weapons. How concerned are you that he would use these over our
troops that are there?
   Bush: Well, I think any time you deal with somebody who has used
chemical weapons on the battlefield, you are concerned about it,
and I would think that he'd know that, given the way the world
views the use of chemical weapons, that it would be intolerable and
that it would be dealt with very, very severely. So I would hope
that there would be no use of chemical weapons.
   Q: Mr. President, I am being told in my ear that there is a
report or a rumor out of Jedda that Saddam Hussein is dead. Have
you heard anything of this?
   Bush: I've not heard anything of that.
   Q: Do you know if the Saudis will _ do you know if the Saudis
will follow _ do you know if the Saudis are going to follow the
Turks' lead in shutting off an Iraqi pipeline, the one (inaudible)?
Have you had any promises from the Saudis or any other
oil-producing countries that they will increase production to make
up for this shortfall?
   Bush: Well, I'm convinced _ I believe that the Venezuelans have
announced a significant increase, and I expect you'd find others to
follow. And what was the first part, John?
   Q: Are the Saudis cutting off the pipeline to _ (inaudible)?
   Bush: That matter will be discussed, I'm sure, and I know that
the Saudis are fully in accord with the action taken by the United
Nations in terms of Chapter 7 sanctions. And so I _ but we have no
deal with them in that regard.
   Q: Sir, it's difficult for us to get information from Saudi
Arabia, one reason being the American news media were not permitted
to accompany American troops into Saudi Arabia. Was that your
decision or King Fahd's?
   Bush: That decision didn't come to me. But there's plenty of
reporters in Saudi Arabia right now.
   Q: Well, do you think there should be a Pentagon pool, as there
was for example in Panama?
   Bush: Well, I'd have to discuss that with the Secretary of
Defense. I'm glad that the matter _ that that many forces could be
moved with not too much advance warning, and with not too much,
therefore, risk to Saudi Arabia or to these troops. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, was there any one single thing that tipped
your hand into deciding to send U.S. troops and aircraft into Saudi
Arabia? And secondly, how supportive have the Soviets been about
your decision?
   Bush: There was no one single thing that I can think of, but
when King Fahd requested such support we were prompt to respond.
But I can't think of an individual specific thing. If there was
one, it would perhaps be the Saudis (sic) moving south when they
said they were withdrawing.
   Q: You mean the Iraqis, sir?
   Bush: I mean, the Iraqis _ thank you very much, it's been a long
night _ moving _ the Iraqis moving down to the Kuwait-Saudi border
when indeed they had given their word that they were withdrawing.
That heightened our concern.
   Q: How supportive have the Soviets been to your decision, sir?
   Bush: The Soviets have been very responsible, in my view. They
have joined the United Nations on that resolution, and Jim Baker,
as recently as yesterday afternoon or evening, was in touch with
Shevardnadze again, and you know, I can't ask for a more favorable
response than he received. Yes, Jerry.
   Q: Mr. President, is it your intention to let economic pressure
alone provide the force that drives Iraq out of Kuwait? Are you
prepared to wait several months, which is how long it might take
for the economic sanctions to really bite?
   Bush: Well, we've taken this first significant step to defend
Saudi Arabia. The economic sanctions should begin to bite pretty
soon. There will be further steps taken to ensure that they are
fully effective, and then we'll wait and see where we go from
there. But I have no _ we're not _ we're not _ I'm not beyond that
in my thinking. There, obviously, is a lot of contingency planning
that always goes on and prudently should go on. Charles, then Ann.

   President Bush said today he was encouraged by
suggestions that 3,500 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait may be allowed
to leave, but added that their safety still cannot be assured.
   Bush told a news conference that one concern was the
``unpredictable'' nature of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Bush spoke after an Iraqi Airways passenger jet arrived from
Iraq in Amman, Jordan, today with more than two dozen Americans as
well as other foreigners, a Jordanian security official said. But a
U.S. Embassy spokesman in Amman said he was unaware of any evacuees
arriving in Jordan.
   It would be the second commercial flight carrying out foreigners
stranded after Thursday's invasion of Kuwait. An Iraqi airliner
arrived in Cairo Tuesday carrying 78 foreigners, mostly Japanese.
   Bush told reporters: ``I want to see them (the Americans) out of
there, obviously. But what he (Saddam Hussein) does, that's a bit
unpredictable.''
   He said protection of American life was ``fundamental to my job
and responsibilities as president.''
   U.S. officials have been concerned since the Iraqi invasion took
place about the fate of the 3,000 or so Americans in Kuwait and the
500 in Iraq.
   The officials spoke of their concerns Tuesday as Bush ordered
U.S. troops and combat planes to Saudi Arabia to protect that
country against a potential attack by Iraq.
   While declining to refer to the Americans as hostages, the State
Department said Tuesday they were not being permitted to leave the
two countries freely.
   Part of the confusion stems from contradictory signals Iraqi
authorities have been sending concerning whether Americans who wish
to leave will be allowed to do so, said the officials, who asked
not to be identified.
   A group of Americans, most of them bused from Kuwait to Baghdad
by Iraqi authorities, were not allowed to leave their hotel in the
Iraqi capital, causing some officials to worry about Iraq's
intentions.
   ``It is our hope that circumstances will permit Americans to
depart Iraq by road within the next few days and eventually that
Baghdad airport will reopen so that all foreigners may depart,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. ``This
depends, obviously, on the government of Iraq opening its borders.''
   She said Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly raised the
issue of the Americans' safety with the Iraqi ambassador on Monday
but received no immediate reply.
   Turkey and Jordan, both neighbors of Iraq, are logical
destinations for Americans who want to leave the country by land.
Jordanian authorities have promised to help any Americans who cross
into their country by land.
   A senior Iraqi official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday that Iraq is considering allowing foreigners,
including U.S. Embassy staff and dependents, to leave by land
through Jordan.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Americans in Kuwait have been advised to leave
the country as soon as possible and a few have managed to leave by
various routes.
   She said it was not clear when Americans and other foreigners
will be allowed to depart freely.
   About 39 Americans are at the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad, many
taken there by bus from Kuwait by Iraqi authorities. Ms. Tutwiler
said they have been interviewed by U.S. consular officials and
appear to be in good shape.
   Among the 39 is Penelope Nabokov, a 10-year-old girl from
Albany, Calif., whose family said she was among 367 passengers
taken from a British Airways jetliner in Kuwait while the invasion
was under way last week. The girl was traveling alone from London
to India, where her mother was doing research.

   A British businessman believed to be the
first foreigner to travel by road from Baghdad to Jordan since the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait said Wednesday he had ``no problem.''
   ``I just took a taxi and went,'' said Bryan Hume, who manages a
freight business based in Amman.
   It was only after he arrived late Tuesday, after a 19-hour
journey, that Hume was informed other foreigners had not been
allowed to leave Iraq.
   Iraq began flying foreigners out later that day. The second
Iraqi Airways passenger jet arrived in Jordan on Wednesday carrying
foreigners, a security official reported.
   The first Iraqi airliner arrived Tuesday carrying 78 foreigners,
mostly Japanese. It was the first commercial flight carrying people
who were stranded in Kuwait and Iraq after Iraq invaded its
neighbor.
   Hume, 52, of Southampton, said he was in Erbil, in northern
Iraq, when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait one week ago. Movement out
of Iraq was barred, but the country has since begun allowing
foreigners to leave.
   ``When I returned to Baghdad, I spent some time with friends and
then simply took a cab and asked to be driven to the border. It was
as simple as that,'' he said.
   ``When I arrived at the Iraqi border post of Rutbah, a surprised
Iraqi civilian told me `How did you get here? Foreigners are not
allowed to leave,''' he said in an interview in his office.
   ``But the Iraqi border officials gave me no trouble. They
stamped my passport and waved me on.''
   Hume said he apparently became the first foreigner to cross the
border after the Iraqi government decided to allow foreigners to
leave.
   Rutbah is 490 miles west of Baghdad and 75 miles east of the
Jordanian border.
   Hume said it was only after he arrived in Amman that he realized
there was an international crisis. ``Everything was perfectly
normal in Baghdad, no excitement, no fear or anything,'' he said.
   ``Of course there is a lot of cheering and patriotic songs on
(Iraqi) TV,'' he said.
   Hume said traffic on the desert highway from Amman to Baghdad
``appeared normal'' and that there was no military presence on the
highway.
   Meanwhile, a Jordanian airport official said a ``preliminary
passenger list'' listed eight French citizens and 32 Britons on the
flight that arrived in Amman on Wednesday.
   He said some Americans also were aboard the Boeing 747 jetliner,
but a U.S. Embassy spokesman said he was unaware of any American
evacuees aboard the plane.

   Q: Mr. President, I can understand the need for individual
countries to announce their own attentions with regards to the
multinational force, but it's our understanding that the Saudis
wanted an Arab component in that force. Is that in fact the case,
and will there be one?
   Bush: They didn't tell us that, but it would not be at all
surprising if there was an Arab component in that force, not at all.
   Q: But you do not have one at this point?
   Bush: Well, I'm not going to comment on _ on _ because I think
announcement of all components really should come from the
participating countries. Yeah, Ann?
   Q: Not even broader, to define it as Arab, if not by nation?
   Bush: No, I told you I wouldn't be surprised if that happened,
but I think that I'd much prefer to have that _ the announcements
of that come from others. This _ I think it is important that the
focus be on Saudi requests and on the defensive nature of the move
we've made with these forces. Yes, Ann?
   Q: Mr. President, you've told us several times of Saddam
Hussein's lies in his dealings with other leaders and with the
United States on his intentions. Why do you now believe the Iraqi
government's statements that they will let Americans go if there
are no _ if there is no evidence of an American being let go?
   Bush: I'm not sure I totally believe them. I hope they're
telling the truth.
   Q: Do you have assurances from any intelligence source, any
other source, that indicates movement by those Americans, or any _
   Bush: Well, I've had a source of movement by some foreigners, so
I would hope that this would then apply to Americans. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, you said in your speech this morning that the
puppet regime in Kuwait was unacceptable, and so was the
acquisition of territory. At the same time, though, you said that
the _ that the deployments are wholly defensive. The question is,
how do you actually expect to force Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait?
   Bush: Economic sanctions in this instance, if fully enforced,
can be very, very effective. It is a rich country in terms of oil
resources. They're a poor country, in a sense, because he
squandered much of the resource on military might, and there are
some indications that he's already beginning to feel the pinch. And
nobody can stand up forever to total economic deprivation. Yes?
   Q: If I could follow that up _ if I can just follow real
quickly. Could you _ will you rule out preemptive strikes against
Iraq?
   Bush: I am not going to go into hypothetical situations. We've
been very careful not to do that, and I'm simply not going to
respond. Maureen; and then we'll go to the aisle.
   Q: Mr. President, could you share with us the precise military
objective of this mission? Will the American troops remain there
only until Saddam Hussein removes his troops from the Saudi border?
   Bush: I can't _ I can't answer that because we have _ we have a
major objective with those troops, which is the defense of the
Soviet Union. So I think it's beyond _
   (Cross talk.)
   Bush: (Laughing) _ a defense of Saudi Arabia _ so I think it's
beyond the _ I think it's beyond just the question of the tanks
along the border.
   Q: Sir, are you preparing for a prolonged ground _
   Bush: A lot of air power, for example.
   Q: Are you preparing for a prolonged ground war in the Persian
Gulf?
   Bush: I'm not preparing for a long ground war in the Persian
Gulf. There's not a war going on there right now.
   Q: But, I'm just saying, could you just tell the American people
what your specific military objective is?
   Bush: My military objective is to see Saudi Arabia defended _
that's the military objective. Our overall objective is to see _
see Saddam Hussein get out and go back and to have the rightful
regime of Kuwait back in place. Yes?

   The ``thank you'' that ended President Bush's
news conference Wednesday came not from the press corps but the
president, thanking reporters for correcting several mistakes.
   Bush verbally confused Iraq and Saudi Arabia and also said the
main U.S. objective in sending troops to the Persian Gulf area was
``the defense of the Soviet Union.''
   Asked at one point what persuaded him to send U.S. troops to
Saudi Arabia, Bush replied, ``If there was one it would perhaps be
the Saudis moving south when they said they were withdrawing.'' As
reporters murmured ``the Iraqis,'' Bush said, ``I mean the Iraqis
moving south. Thank you very much. It's been a long night.''
   Later, Bush said, ``We have a major objective with those troops,
which is the defense of the Soviet Union.''
   As reporters chorused ``Saudi Arabia,'' Bush laughed and
corrected himself.
   Bush also spoke of the pre-invasion substantial ``boycott'' of
Iraqi troops on the Kuwait border. He caught the mistake himself,
changing the word to ``buildup.''
   He ended the brief news conference with these words:
   ``Thank you all very much and let me just say this on a personal
basis. I screwed up a couple of times here, and I'm very grateful
for your assistance in straightening it out.
   ``God, I'd hate to have had some of those answers stand,'' Bush
added.

   The Broadway production of ``Miss Saigon'' was
canceled Wednesday after Actors' Equity refused to allow a white
British actor to play the role of a Eurasian in the musical.
   ``The debate is no longer about the casting of `Miss Saigon' but
the art of acting itself,'' producer Cameron Mackintosh said in a
statement issued on behalf of the creative team for the hit London
musical.
   The show, scheduled to open in March at the Broadway Theater,
had a more than $25 million advance sale, the largest in Broadway
history. The money, according to Mackintosh, will be refunded. The
producer said an estimated $600,000, already spent on
pre-production work for the show, has been lost.
   The union Tuesday denied Englishman Jonathan Pryce permission to
repeat his award-winning performance as a brothel owner when the
London hit comes to New York in March.
   ``The casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an
affront to the Asian community,'' said Alan Eisenberg, the union's
executive secretary.
   ``The casting choice is especially disturbing when the casting
of an Asian actor in this role would be an important and
significant opportunity to break the usual pattern of casting
Asians in minor roles.''
   The union has jurisdiction over all performers appearing on
Broadway and must give its approval to actors from foreign
countries who appear there, except for British ``stars.'' But the
definition of ``star'' is hazy.
   ``We did not deal with the issue of whether this man is a star
or not,'' Eisenberg said.
   Mackintosh said he would not take the matter to arbitration, a
process Equity suggested Tuesday might be the next step.
   ``The inaccurate and inflammatory statements which Equity made
concerning `Miss Saigon' have served only to craete a poisonous
atmosphere in which creativity and artistic freedom cannot function
or survive,'' Mackintosh said. ``Arbitration cannot clear this
atmosphere.''
   Mackintosh and other producers have argued that the ban is an
infringement on their right to choose the performers they want.
   ``When my production team cast the noted black actor Robert
Guillaume to replace Michael Crawford as the Phantom in the Los
Angeles company of `Phantom of the Opera,' we did so purely on the
grounds of talent and suitability,'' Mackintosh said last week.
   ``Ironically, in the current Broadway production of `Phantom' we
have an Amerasian actor of tremendous ability playing the lead role
of the Vicomte de Chagny. Why is it quite proper for him to play a
European artistocrat and not for Jonathan Pryce to play a
Eurasian?''
   Robert Stigwood, who produced the musical ``Evita,'' said in a
letter to Equity earlier this week that he is casting the film
version of the show.
   ``Does the view of Actors' Equity concerning ethnic casting
preclude my consideration of an American-Italian female star to
play the title role?'' he asked. ``Will I incur the wrath and
condemnation of Actors' Equity for casting a non-Hispanic in the
role of Che?''
   Eisenberg said the union's decision was made ``in full awareness
that many jobs may be lost to actors of Asian background'' if
``Miss Saigon'' is canceled.
   According to Variety, the musical would employ 182 people,
including 50 actors and stage managers, 26 musicians and 34
stagehands.
   Non-traditional casting has been more common off-Broadway,
particularly at the New York Shakespeare Festival, where black
actor Morgan Freeman recently played Petruchio opposite Tracey
Ullman, who is white, in a Central Park production of ``The Taming
of the Shrew.''
   The festival has used black, Hispanic and Asian actors in almost
all its recent Shakespeare productions. It even cast actress Diane
Venora in the title role in ``Hamlet'' several years ago.
   ``You do non-traditional casting whenever possible, but it
depends,'' said Alan Coleridge, a casting director. ``You look at
the text. Does the text support it?''
   The controversy over ``Miss Saigon'' began with a complaint
filed by playwright David Henry Hwang, author of ``M. Butterfly,''
and actor B.D. Wong, who starred in the play.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind of the irreparable damage to my
rights as an actor that would be wrought if ... Asian actors are
kept from bringing their unique dignity to the specifically Asian
roles in `Miss Saigon,''' Wong said in a letter to Equity President
Colleen Dewhurst.
   In London, Pryce won the Olivier Award as best actor in a
musical for his performance in ``Miss Saigon.'' He won praise on
Broadway in 1976 for his performance in ``Comedians,'' which earned
him a best-actor Tony Award.
   About 300 to 400 of Equity's 40,000 members are Asian, Eisenberg
said.
   ``We are talking here about color and this union responding to
the wishes of its membership,'' Dewhurst said Tuesday.

   Q: Mr. President, can you tell us what U.S. and Saudi forces
will be up against? You mentioned surface-to-surface missiles,
you've spoken previously of the chemical warfare capability of the
Saudis (sic: may mean Iraqis). What are they up against? And the
second question is _ the second part of the question is, did we
misread Saddam Hussein? A couple of months ago, your people were up
on the _ the administration was up on the Hill deflecting a move to
put sanctions on _ on _ on _
   Bush: Let me _ let me ask you _ I'm not going to take the
question on the exact military problem there because we're going to
have a thorough briefing at the Pentagon _ I think they're much
better equipped to handle that kind of detail. On Saddam Hussein,
look, we have tried very hard to see if there wasn't a way to have
somewhat improved relations _ there's no question about that. But _
and I have no regret about having tried to have discussions that
might have led to a better relationship.
   But that had to stop the minute you have this _ this kind of
aggression. But I don't think having _ having tried tentatively to
have a little better relationship with a person over the last
couple of years _ we've still been very, very wary all along of his
_ of his intentions.
   Q: But did our intelligence let us down or _ or did you know
that what has happened _ when did you get an indication of _
(inaudible) _ as far as moving into Kuwait and that sort of thing?
   Bush: No, I don't _ I don't feel let down by the intelligence at
all. When you plan a blitzkrieg-like attack that's launched at 2:00
in the morning, it's pretty hard to stop, particularly when you
have just been given the word of the people involved that there
wouldn't be any such attack. And I think the intelligence community
deserves certain credit for _ for _ for picking up what was a
substantial boycott _ (correcting himself) a substantial buildup
and then reporting it to us. So _ and this information was relayed
properly to interested parties, but the move was so swift that it
was pretty hard for them to stop it. I really can't blame our
intelligence in any way _ fault them in this particular _ in this
particular go-round. Yeah, Ellen?
   Q: Mr. President, you said this morning that our troops will
also defend our other friends in the Gulf. Do we view the American
troops there as peacekeepers throughout the Gulf?
   Bush: We view them there to defend Saudi Arabia, and hopefully
their presence there will deter adventurism against any of the
other Gulf countries. Yes?
   Q: What other countries, sir, are we prepared to defend in the
Gulf region?
   Bush: Well, I'm not going to give you a list, but _ but we're
certainly interested in the freedom and the independence of all
those countries in the GCC, just for openers. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, do you see any domestic impact on the budget
talks or deficit from this situation in the Middle East, impact on
the gasoline tax possibility or in any other way?
   Bush: Well, an operation of this nature has considerable expense
associated with it. But I've asked for some estimates now as to
what that _ what that price may be, but whatever it is, we're going
to have to pay it. But I don't have the exact figures yet. John?
   Q: Mr. President, the national security analysts say that this
crisis demonstrates once again the vulnerability _ constant
vulnerability of the oil fields in the Middle East. Doesn't this
suggest that this force that you've sent over there may be there
for some time, or at least fragments of it will be there to make
sure that there is a steady flow?
   Bush: Well, you might interpret it that way. I'm not prepared to
say that I think that's what the outcome will be, because I think
if there is this pull-back that the world is calling for, and if
the sanctions are effective, I think you would reduce the risk of
future adventurism.

<TEXT>
   Israelis hurled stones at Arab-owned cars
Wednesday as an unprecedented wave of anti-Arab rioting in
Jerusalem entered its third day.
   The riots erupted Monday after the discovery of the bodies of
two Jewish teen-agers who had been stabbed to death, apparently by
Palestinian militants. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets,
injuring dozens of Arabs in stoning attacks.
   Mayor Teddy Kollek, a champion of coexistence in this mixed
Arab-Jewish city, said the riots were ``the most effective attempt
to re-divide the city.''
   ``It will remain a unified city, but the question is, what kind
of city? Will it be a pleasant city like in the last 20 years or a
hard city like in the last 2{ years?'' Kollek said, referring to
the 32-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   For Israel, unity of Jerusalem, its declared eternal capital,
has been a matter of prestige since it captured Arab east Jerusalem
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it to west
Jerusalem.
   Palestinians demand east Jerusalem, home to 140,000 Arabs, be
the capital of their would-be state. Israel refuses to negotiate on
the unity of the city.
   Invisible barriers, strengthened by the Palestinian uprising,
now crisscross the city, dividing Arab and Jewish neighborhoods.
   Most of Jerusalem's 354,000 Jews are afraid to visit the city's
eastern sector, fearing stonings, stabbings or firebomb attacks.
   Of the 47 Israeli victims of the uprising, eight have been
killed in Jerusalem. At least nine Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli security forces.
   Until recently, anti-Arab rioting was rare, but now fear has
gripped the Arabs.
   ``I have a car with blue plates which means I'm an Arab, and
frankly speaking I don't feel safe to drive to the western part of
the city,'' said Ziad Abu Ziad, a pro-PLO newspaper editor.
   Arabs from the occupied territories have blue license plates,
while Israeli citizens, Arabs and Jews, have yellow license plates.
   Israeli officials, such as district police commander Rahamim
Comfort, acknowledged that ``such a situation never existed in the
past.''
   Kollek described Tuesday as ``the hardest day Jerusalem ever
had.'' That was after riots broke out following the funeral for the
slain teen-agers.
   Thousands of Israelis, many chanting ``Death to the Arabs,''
thronged the funeral. Dozens of Arabs were injured in the ensuing
rioting. One of the wounded was in critical condition Wednesday.
   The violence continued Wednesday as Jewish mobs stoned
Arab-owned cars and taxis. Several windshields were smashed, but
there were no reports of injuries.
   Israel radio said that by late Wednesday police had arrested
some 35 Jews for stoning Arabs and their property over the past two
days.
   Many West Bank Palestinians stayed away from Jerusalem for fear
of attack.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's adviser, Avi Pazner, insisted
that the city is not divided.
   ``This is nonsense. I heard the same two months ago when there
were disturbances in (Arab villages of) Silwan and A-Tur,'' Pazner
said. ``The key is that the Arabs have to understand that this is
one city, that they have to live in peace with us. Any action like
such a horrible murder ...will make tensions rise.''

   Hurricane Diana weakened to a tropical
depression today and moved inland from the Gulf of Mexico,
battering northeastern mountains after triggering mudslides and
flooding.
   Two deaths were reported in the Gulf city of Tuxpan and one in
Veracruz after the worst of the storm passed Tuesday.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the storm had winds of 35 mph and its center was
located 100 miles northeast of Mexico City and moving west at 12
mph, the U.S. National Weather Service said.
   The Weather Service said it expected rainfall of up to 8 inches
over the next day, which could produce flash flooding and mudslides.
   About 500 Tuxpan residents spent the night in local schools, and
Mayor Perecles Namorado Urruita said some 4,000 homes were wrecked
by the hurricane, which local officials said packed winds of up to
120 mph at the height Tuesday afternoon.
   The Federal Highway Police said scores of cars and other
vehicles were stranded for hours by flash floods on the
Tampico-Altamira highway, which in some places was under more than
six feet of water.
   On Tuesday, Diana packed winds of 90 mph in the Gulf of Mexico
after sweeping by the Yucatan Peninsula and Campeche state.
   The storm knocked down power and telephone lines in Veracruz and
Tamaulipas states. Large areas were without telephone service or
electricity, dozens of roads were blocked by fallen trees and
mudslides and hundreds of people were flooded out of their homes.
   Red Cross spokesman Rosario Romero Hernandez in the port city of
Veracruz said one man was killed by a falling tree Monday night.
   About 800 families were flooded out of their homes in Tampico, a
port in neighboring Tamaulipas state, the government news agency
Notimex reported. It said another 70 families lost their homes in
Ciudad Madero and 500 people were flooded out in Altamira.
   The Federal Highway Police said scores of cars and other
vehicles were stranded for hours by flash floods on the
Tampico-Altamira highway, which in some places was under more than
six feet of water.
   Tropical storms have sustained surface winds of between 39 and
74 miles per hour, while a hurricane is at least 74 mph.

<TEXT>
   Q: In your call to the producing countries to pick up the slack,
do you expect that to begin immediately?
   Bush: Well, I think it will start very, very soon. I don't know
about today, by any _
   Q: Mr. President, with the economy tipping close to the edge of
a recession, do you think we still can afford to raise taxes or cut
spending, or won't that increase the risk of a (inaudible)
recession?
   Bush: I still think it's absolutely essential to get a budget
agreement, and that's going to require a lot of compromise and it's
going to require a lot of principle. But you know, what I want to
do is separate out my feelings about the budget now that I feel
uninhibited by an agreement not to say anything, because I want to
tell you exactly how strongly I feel about it. But I don't want to
do it here today. I don't want to mix it into this briefing that is
largely, you know, dominated by the world concern about the Middle
East. But I feel like a liberated human being now. I don't feel
bound by _
   Q: Why not?
   Bush: _ by _ may I finish what I'm saying here? (Laughs.) I
don't feel bound by an agreement that I've told the congressional
leaders is no longer in effect. And we've been getting one side of
that, mainly from the Democrats in the Congress. And now you're
fixing to get the other, but not this minute; you have to stay
tuned.
   Q: Mr. President, to follow up, do you think the spike in oil
prices which has occurred significantly at home as a result of the
Persian Gulf problem could edge the economy into a recession?
   Bush: I have not been advised of that. I hope that is not the
case, and what I hope to do is see a reduction in oil prices once a
_ once it becomes clear that there will not be shortage. There's an
overhang now of oil in the marketplace, thank God. We have a
Strategic Petroleum Reserve that we can draw from. Other countries
have the same _ a couple of other countries have SPRs themselves.
And I hope that this rapid spike on oil prices will not be
permanent, and I think if we _ if the world begins to see
assurances, that there will not be a dramatic cutoff _ or cutdown
on oil, that then things will return much more to normal in the
market. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President?
   Q: Mr. President, assuming that _
   Bush: One more after this.
   Q: _ assuming that we achieve the goal of Iraqi forces out of
Kuwait, Saddam Hussein is still going to be sitting there on top of
a million-man army _ (inaudible). What happens in the long run
after that, and can you contain that with _ short of removing
Saddam Hussein from power?
   Bush: I would think that if this international lesson is taught
well, that Saddam Hussein would behave differently in the future.
And that's what has been so very important about this concerted
United Nations effort, unprecedented you might say or certainly not
enacted since 19 _ what was it? 23 years ago? _ 19 _ 23 years ago.
So, I _ I _ I don't think we can see that clearly down the road,
but a line has been drawn in the sand. The United States has taken
a firm position, and I might say we're getting strong support from
around the world for what we've done. I've been very, very pleased
about that. Large countries and small countries. The world reaction
has been excellent. And I would hope that all of this would result
in Saddam Hussein or some calmer heads in Iraq understanding that
this kind of international behavior is simply unacceptable, and we
see where we go.
   Q: Mr. President?
   Bush: Yes, Sarah?
   Q: Sir, would you please _
   Bush: This is the last question.
   Q: I understand that we provide most of the food for Iraq and
have done so on the long term and short term and subsidy payments,
credit (inaudible) for some time. That means that we've been
letting them have a lot of food and a lot of other products from
our farmers at probably low rates, arranged by the Department of
Agriculture. Now, do you _ would you please discuss the effect of
your embargo; and how much do you think that the Iraqis already owe
us for food?
   Bush: Well, I don't know what they owe us for food, but I know
that this embargo, to be successful, has got to encompass
everything. And if there are _ you know, if there's a humanitarian
concern, pockets of starving children or something of this nature,
why, I would take a look. But other than that, this embargo is
going to be all encompassing, and it will include food. And I don't
know what Iraq owes us now for food. Generally speaking, in normal
times we have felt that food might be separated out from _ you
know, grain, wheat, might be separated out from other economic
sanctions. But this one is all encompassing and the language is
pretty clear in the United Nations resolution.
   Thank you all very much. And let me just say this, on a personal
basis. I've screwed up a couple of times here and I'm very grateful
for your assistance in straightening it out. God, I'd hate to have
had some of those answers stand.
   Thank you.

<TEXT>
   A deeply divided American Bar Association
rescinded its 6-month-old endorsement of abortion rights Wednesday
and leaders immediately called for healing among the orgbers.
   The ABA's policy-making House of Delegates voted 200-188 to
repeal aanization's
mem resolution that the nationwide lawyers' group had adopted
in February by a more than two-to-one margin.
   Repeal proponents said Wednesday's about face returned the
organization to a neutral position on the explosive issue. But
abortion rights forces said the fight was far from over.
   ``Nobody here has the illusion we're going to put our tails
between our legs and go home,'' said Estelle Rogers of Washington,
D.C., who opposed the repeal.
   Anthony R. Palermo of Rochester, N.Y., who led the repeal drive,
said a continuing feud over abortion rights could hurt the ABA's
reputation.
   ``It would be a grave mistake if we keep dominating each meeting
with this issue,'' he said. ABA conventions are held twice a     $0.01

<NOTE>EDs: Combines pvs, raising reference to AWACs and adding Powell
quote on Iraqi forces; edits to shorten</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   American ground and air forces fortified Saudi
Arabia's defenses against Iraq today, with two powerful aircraft
carriers positioned to block vital sea routes and protect troops
rushing into the desert kingdom.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs, said
the first U.S. military aircraft dispatched from the United States
have arrived in Saudi Arabia and `taken up position.''
   Powell said five AWACs reconnaissance planes were arriving
today. In addition, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the United
States had granted a Saudi request to waive the cap on the number
of F-15 jetfighters the kingdom is allowed.
   At a Pentagon briefing, Powell and Cheney refused to provide
many specific details of the U.S. troop movements or describe the
size of the sudden deployment.
   ``You can be sure that for the mission we have been given we
will put in adequate forces,'' Powell said. Of the battle-tested
Iraqis, Powell said: ``They are not invincible. They are not
10-feet tall.''
   Powell, using a map of the Gulf area, demonstrated where the
aircraft carrier USS Independence and its support ships have taken
up positions just outside the Persian Gulf and the carrier USS
Eisenhower in the Red Sea _ not far from the end point of an Iraqi
oil pipeline and within range for its aircraft and other weapons to
engage Iraqi forces.
   On the ground already in Saudi Arabia are the first arrivals
among the warplanes and ground forces ordered into the oil-rich
country on Tuesday, the Pentagon officials said.
   Powell said the troops brought with them protective clothing and
medical supplies to be used in the event Iraq uses its sizeable
stores of chemical weapons against the American forces.
   Powell and Cheney briefed reporters four hours after President
Bush delivered a nationally televised address in which he confirmed
his decision to send U.S. forces into the tense Persian Gulf region.
   Cheney described the deployment as ``a major commitment of U.S.
forces'' but said he could not provide specific details for
strategic reasons.
   ``Our purpose in sending forces at this time into the gulf
region and to Saudi Arabia in particular is to deter any further
Iraqi aggression,'' Cheney said. He said he expected other nations
to join the U.S. forces in the area, but with the exception of
Great Britain, he refused to name other nations expected to
participate in the multinational effort.
   Pentagon sources said earlier that the U.S. arsenal will include
heavy tanks for possible ground battles and sophisticated cruise
missiles programmed to destroy specific Iraqi targets.
   Thirty-two Tomahawk cruise missiles are aboard the battleship
Wisconsin, which was sent from the United States to the gulf area
Tuesday night, according to sources, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   The sources also said today that a second Navy cruiser had been
added to the gulf, bringing the number of U.S. ships in the
strategic waterway to nine.
   At the Pentagon briefing, Powell said the carrier Eisenhower,
accompanied by five other warships, today completed its transit of
the Suez Canal enroute to the gulf.
   President Bush, in his speech this morning, said the U.S. forces
were on a ``wholly defensive'' mission, and added: ``They will not
initiate hostilities, but they will defend themselves.''
   Should it come to that, one of the sources today said the
Tomahawks would be a crucial part of the U.S. arsenal.
   ``They are sophisticated, terrain-following cruise missiles
programmed with special software packages that allow them to hone
in on specific targets, such as Iraqi oil refineries,'' the source
said. ``You sit off beyond the range of the Iraqis and fire in.''
   The sources also said several of the Marines' prepositioned
supply ships based at the super-secret U.S. facility on the island
of Diego Garcia have set sail for the region, the sources said.
   ``This first movement is of light infantry and airborne troops.
But these ships have the heavy tanks, M1-A1 Abrams and M-60s, that
are needed for heavy-duty ground fighting,'' one source said.
   It will take the Wisconsin, which is escorting the carrier
Saratoga, at least a week to reach the eastern Mediterranean, the
sources said.
   U.S. forces were ordered into Saudi Arabia and the gulf region
Tuesday as the Bush administration, with fresh intelligence on
Iraqi troop activities in Kuwait, declared the Saudi kingdom under
``imminent threat'' of attack.
   Under the Saudi desert lie the largest oil reserves in the world.
   Cheney, as Bush had earlier, declined to speculate on the
possible length of the historic U.S. presence in the volatile
region.
   ``We don't know how long it will last,'' Cheney said.
   Among the dangers facing U.S. troops in a conflict with Iraq is
Saddam's arsenal of chemical arms and his track record of using
them as a weapon of mass destruction.
   Powell said it was unclear whether Iraq was preparing its
chemical weapons for use, ``but we attribute them with that
capability.''
   The Army units facing duty in Saudi Arabia are part of the
nation's rapid deployment .''
   The reaction from Iraq was defiant. State television declared
that ``history has proved that Kuwait is a part of Iraq.''
   In his remarks, the president conceded that the Saudi defense
mission ``may take time and be costly'' and said he would consider
tapping the nation's strategic petroleum reserves to assure a ready
supply of oil. He called on the oil companies not to engage in
unnecessary price hikes to take advantage of the international
uncertainty and urged that other oil-producing nations boost
production.
   Bush sidestepped a question about what other countries would be
joining a multi-national force in Saudi Arabia. ``I'd prefer to
leave that to'' the Saudis to announce, he said. He noted that
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had said she would commit
forces.
   Egypt and Morocco had said they were not participating in the
Saudi defense buildup, contrary to reports from some U.S. sources.
Bush said encouraging things about both nations, but did not claim
their involvement.
   Bush said ``It wouldn't be at all surprising'' if there were an
Arab component in the force that eventually took shape in Saudi
Arabia.
   Bush also said he was concerned with the possibility that Iraq
might use chemical weapons, since it has employed them in the past.
``It would be intolerable and it would be dealt with very, very
severely.''
   Powell said the American forces were equipped with masks,
clothing and medicine to thwart the chemical weapons.
   He expressed confidence about the mission, saying of the
battle-tested Iraqis, ``They are not invincible. They are not 10
feet tall.''

   ,
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Hundreds of expatriates flooded
airports Wednesday, hoping to leave Saudi Arabia following news of
the military escalation resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Transister radio sales boomed as nationals and expatriates tuned
in to hear the latest news of U.S. military intervention and Arab
reaction.
   They had to find foreign stations. The state-run radio and
television maintained regular programs, which consist mainly of
religious discussions and chanting of verses from the Koran.
   ``We are calm, because we trust in God,'' said Atiya al-Anzi, a
shopkeeper in Dammam. ``We will be afflicted only if God wills it
this way. Otherwise, God will protect us and grant victory to our
leaders. But I must admit that households (families) are a bit
scared.''
   The U.S. troop deployment to the kingdom increased apprehension
among expatriate communities, especially in the Eastern Province,
home of the world's largest oil fields.
   Some U.S. and other expatriates were reported sending away their
dependents. Arab, Indian and other workers stood in long lines
requesting exit and re-entry visas, so they can return when calm is
restored.
   The management of the Arabian-American Oil Company, or Aramco,
was reported to be weighing the advisability of evacuating some of
its 38,000 expatriate employees or dependents. They live mainly in
Dhahran, Sanajib and Khafji, in the Eastern Province near the
crisis area on the Saudi border with Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   About 28,000 Americans live and work in Saudi Arabia. They make
up the largest American community overseas.
   The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh recommended that American citizens
depart.
   ``Due to the Iraqi military invasion of Kuwait and continuing
unstable conditions in the region, the Department of State advises
all Americans to defer all travel to the (Saudi) Eastern Province,
Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates,`` the U.S. Embassy
told members of the American community.
   ``The department is permitting dependents of U.S. government
officials to depart the area on a voluntary basis. The department
advises other Americans to consider doing the same.''
   There were no symptoms of war fever, but civil servants operated
in an air of emergency. They arrived at offices earlier and staying
much later than usual.
   The government-guided newspapers had front-page editorials in
support of Kuwait against Iraq, stressing that the Saudi government
would spare no effort to protect its people and seek an honorable
way out of the crisis.
   ``Our government has been serving Moslem and Arab brethren with
sincerity and honesty, and as such will never fail to crush these
devils,'' said Abdul-Rahman Salem, a merchant in Jiddah.
   ``The Iraqis have done themselves no good by hurting Kuwait,
whose ruler is a kind and honest man. (Iraqi President) Saddam
Hussein has sown the seeds of mischief and he can only reap the
fruits of evil.''

<HEAD>Police Report Five Deaths in Violence in Suburbs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Wednesday that
five people have been shot to death in three days of looting,
burning and battles between police and mobs in mixed-race suburbs
of Port Elizabeth.
   Police headquarters in Pretoria said four of the dead were shot
by officers.
   Police roamed the northern suburbs in armored vehicles, firing
birdshot and tear gas at stone-throwing groups Wednesday, said a
journalist.
   The violence began Monday and spread to numerous suburbs of the
eastern port city.
   Members of the Northern Areas Action Committee said police fired
tear gas at them as they left a meeting Monday. Police said they
fired tear gas, stun grenades, birdshot, and finally pistols after
crowds repeatedly attacked a police bus Monday night.
   The Northern Areas Action Committee is allied with the African
National Congress, but there was no evidence either organization
was controlling the crowds.
   Journalists said much of the mob violence was directed at people
connected with the local council structures set up by the white-run
provincial government. The Evening Post newspaper quoted an
unidentified ANC member as saying the violence would stop when the
local government management committee resigned.
   Police and officials of the Northern Areas Action Committee and
the ANC said the mobs were running wild.
   ``It is out of control to a great extent, but we are trying our
hardest to keep our people disciplined,'' said Ronald Niegaardt,
chairman of the Northern Areas Action Committee. ``Some criminal
elements have become involved and they are looting all over the
place for their own benefit.''
   The journalist, who did not want to be identified, described the
scene Wednesday: ``They are looting, they are stoning police, they
are putting up roadblocks, using tires and refuse. There are lots
of onblookers standing by and the police are riding around in
Casspirs (armored vehicles). They are shooting with birdshot and
tear gas.
   ``From the air you can see fires in quite a few places. A large
number of shops have been broken into and the goods looted,'' said
the journalist.
   Cliff Foster, a reporter for the Newscape news agency, said,
``The northern areas are cut off from the outside world by burning
barricades erected at all entrance and exit routes as police and
mobs continued to battle in the street.''
   Barricades and stonethrowers kept ambulances from entering the
suburbs. They circled the perimeters, picking up wounded when
notified by police, but there was no estimate of how many people
had been injured.
   Pupils and teachers were unable to get to schools, and most
people were prevented from getting to work.

   The government announced today that an Arab
summit on the Iraqi invasion will be held in Cairo on Thursday.
King Hussein of Jordan said the meeting will be the ``last change''
to resolve the crisis peacefully.
   In a nationally televised speech, President Hosni Mubarak
spurned a U.S. plan for multinational forces under its leadership
in Saudi Arabia, opting instead for a purely Arab force.
   Mubarak called for an emergency Arab summit ``within 24 hours''
to discuss the crisis and offered to host the summit.
   At a news conference in Amman, Jordan, King Hussein of Jordan
said he would attend the conference. ``We are trying to resolve the
problem in an Arab context,'' the king said.
   He described the meeting as the Arab world's ``last chance'' to
solve the problem without resorting to further violence.
   He said he could understand the anger of Arabs over the
inability of Arab states to resolve the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by
themselves. `
   ``I have no plan to present,'' Hussein said. ``The plan will be
presented by the Arabs themselves. It will be a good and open
meeting.''
   Mohammed Abdel-Moneim, Mubarak's press secretary, told reporters
that the summit will convene in Cairo Thursday evening.
   ``Arab leaders will begin arriving for the summit in a matter of
hours,'' he said. ``This quick response reflects a sense of the
gravity of the situation which President Mubarak stressed in his
speech.''
   Abdel-Moneim did not give the exact number of Arab countries
that accepted Mubarak's summit proposal. But he said they included
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Algeria, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates,
Yemen, Libya and Qatar.

<HEAD>Bush: No Longer Bound by Vow of Silence on Budget Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday he's no longer
bound by his vow of silence with the Democrats on the deficit
talks, making him ``feel like a liberated human being.''
   Bush, at a news conference on his decision to send U.S. troops
and warplanes to Saudi Arabia, did not unburden himself of his
feelings on the long sputtering talks. But he left no doubt that he
soon will.
   ``I still think it's absolutely essential to get a budget
agreement, and that's going to require a lot of compromise and it's
going to require a lot of principle,'' Bush said.
   He said he would like ``to tell you exactly how strongly I feel
about it, but I don't want to do it here today. I don't want to mix
it into this briefing ... dominated by the world concern about the
Middle East.
   ``But I feel like a liberated human being now. I don't feel
bound by an agreement that I've told the congressional leaders is
no longer in effect,'' Bush said.
   ``We've been getting one side of that mainly from the Democrats
in the Congress,'' Bush said. ``And now you're fixing to get the
other, but not this minute. You have to stay tuned.''
   The president indicated earlier that he would feel free to speak
out against the Democrats because they failed to come forward with
a plan of their own.
   The budget talks, begun in May, came to a temporary halt last
week when lawmakers left town on a one-month summer vacation. Bush
and congressional leaders Congress plan to take another crack after
Labor Day at whittling down the nearly $170 billion deficit looming
for 1991.
   Bush said that sending U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia entails
``considerable expense.''
   ``I've asked for some estimates now as to what that price may
be, but whatever it is, we're going to have to pay it,'' he said.
   The White House said Tuesday that it has given the initial order
to federal agencies to prepare for deep, automatic spending cuts in
October if the budget talks fail.
   Without an agreement, the Gramm-Rudman law will require
across-the-board cuts in many programs of roughly $100 billion.
That's not counting the cost of the savings-and-loan bailout, which
could push the actual 1991 deficit from $169 billion to $231
billion or more.
   Gramm-Rudman requires a 1991 deficit no larger than $64 billion.
   Bush in late June backed off his ``no-new-taxes'' campaign
promise and acknowledged that solving the deficit will require tax
revenue increases. Both sides agreed at the outset to try to
conduct the bargaining with no private preconditions.
   A Republican proposal to raise taxes on alcohol and limit state
and local income tax deductions subsequently came to light, while
the Democrats refused to put any package of their own on the table.
   The negotiators were aiming at reducing the deficit by $50
billion in 1991 and $500 billion over five years.
   With the sluggish economy already veering dangerously close to a
recession even before the recent spike in oil prices, some
economists predict the budget negotiators will be forced to adopt a
more modest goal for reducing next year's red ink.

<HEAD>Study: Many Americans Can't Afford Necessities After Housing Costs</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third of Americans are ``shelter poor,''
spending so much of their incomes on housing that they can't afford
other necessities, a study released Wednesday said.
   The report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal economic
research organization, said 27 million households ``are unable to
meet their non-shelter needs at even a minimum level of adequacy''
because of high housing costs.
   Those households contain 78 million people, or 32 percent of the
population, the organization said.
   The study said 42 percent of all who rent their homes were
``shelter poor'' in 1987, the last year of the study. Twenty-two
percent of homeowners were in that category, it said.
   The number of ``shelter poor'' households increased from 18.7
million in 1970 to 26.5 million in 1987, a 42 percent increase, the
study concluded.
   The study's author, Michael E. Stone, professor of community
planning at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, used an
index that assumes a family pays its rent or mortgage first, then
uses what income is left to pay for basic needs such as food,
clothing, transportation and medical care.
   He concludes that people are ``shelter poor'' if their household
has too little left after paying the housing costs to afford the
minimum basic necessities, as defined by the federal government's
bureau of labor statistics low budget standards.
   Stone's index differs from conventional rules of thumb that
families have housing affordability difficulty if they pay more
than 25 or 30 percent of their income for housing. He instead used
a sliding scale of affordability, varying with income and size of
household.
   ``Some households can afford less than the traditional 25
percent of income,'' Stone said. ``Indeed, some can afford nothing
for housing while others can pay more than 25 percent and even 30
percent without hardship.''
   His report contends that growth in one and two-person households
since 1970 has concealed an increase in housing affordability
problems experienced by families with children.
   The ``shelter poverty'' rate for one and two-person households
declined from 32 percent to 26 percent during the period, while the
rate for households with three or more people rose from 29 percent
to 34 percent.
   The problem is worst among the poorest one-third of households,
but also affects some middle-income households, particularly
renters, the study said.
   The study said the average ``shelter poor'' household faced a
gap of $290 a month between what they were paying and could afford
for housing.
   ``Shelter poverty is in part a problem of worsening income
inequality and declining real incomes among those at the bottom of
the distribution,'' the study said. ``But it is also a problem of
escalating housing costs... .''

<HEAD>L-Tryptophan Outbreak Linked to Manufacturing Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The recent outbreak of a potentially fatal disease
linked to L-tryptophan probably came from an impurity introduced by
a change in how the dietary supplement was made, according to a
report.
   Disease experts in several states have traced the mysterious
illness to supplements made by one Japanese chemical company that
produces L-tryptophan in bulk.
   Now, doctors have tracked down the specific batches responsible
for the outbreak and conclude that changes in the way they were
made, including less filtering of possible toxic contaminants, were
the most likely cause.
   ``We believe that some of the (toxic) agent has been getting
into L-tryptophan for years,'' said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm.
   ``But there was a series of circumstances that may have
increased the agent in the product in late 1988 and at the same
time resulted in lowering the amount removed in the finished
product.''
   Osterholm, the Minnesota state epidemiologist, said researchers
are now trying to pinpoint the poisonous substance that apparently
contaminated the supplements.
   All L-tryptophan was ordered off the market in the United States
in March after it was linked with an outbreak of
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome that has struck more than 1,500
people, killing 27. The painful blood disorder can cause high
fever, rash, weakness and shortness of breath, among other symptoms.
   L-tryptophan, an amino acid, has been used to treat insomnia,
depression and other disorders. It is made in bulk by six
companies, but the outbreak was linked to the Showa Denko K.K. firm
of Japan.
   Osterholm was senior author of the latest report, along with
other researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the
Mayo Clinic and the Minnesota Department of Health. It was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   While most of the cases of the blood disease associated with
L-tryptophan were spotted during 1988 and 1989, Osterholm said
others occurred in the early 1980s.
   L-tryptophan is made in fermentation vats by the bacteria
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens.
   The researchers found that the problems began after Showa Denko
started using a new strain of the microbe and cut in half the
amount of carbon used to filter out impurities.
   ``What we were able to demonstrate without a doubt was that
there were changes that occurred that let more of it (the toxic
substance) be in there,'' said Osterholm.
   Alan Wachter, a spokesman for Showa Denko, said, ``The company
has acknowledged that there was a statistical profile that pointed
to their product'' as the cause of the outbreak. However, he said
it is still uncertain whether the fault lies in changes in its
manufacturing process.

   Former Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose
arrived at a federal work camp today to begin serving a five-month
sentence for filing false tax returns, prison officials said.
   Baseball's career hit leader reported to the prison at about 1
p.m., according to a statement released by warden John Clark.
   ``Mr. Rose will have all the rights and obligations as all
prisoners and will receive no special privileges,'' Clark said.
``We will have his term pass as uneventfully as possible for him
and the other prisoners.''
   Rose said he did not want to talk to reporters, and Clark's
statement said the prison will respect his request for privacy.
   Rose, 49, was facing a Friday deadline to enter the minimum
security Federal Prison Camp. He was convicted on two counts of
filing false income tax returns for failing to report more than
$350,000 in income from gambling, autograph signing and baseball
memorabilia sales.
   He delayed reporting to prison while he recovered from knee
surgery he underwent July 20, the same day he was sentenced by U.S.
Distict Judge S. Arthur Spiegel.
   His release is scheduled for Jan. 7, 1991. Rose has said he
hoped to be home for Christmas, and authorities have said he could
knock 15 to 20 days off his sentence for good behavior.
   During his first two weeks at the camp, Rose will stay in a
building apart from the main dormitory while he is oriented to
prison life, authorities said. Prison officials will interview him
to match his skills to one of about 35 prison jobs.
   He will not be permitted to give interviews during the
orientation period. Rose's attorneys have said he will not grant
interviews during his entire term, said assistant warden Randy
Davis.
   Prison guards have been prohibited from seeking Rose's autograph.
   Camp inmates have been eagerly awaiting his arrival and have
said they hope he will play on a prison softball team. Rose also
will have use of the camp's basketball, tennis, handball and boccie
ball courts, and a weight room.
   He originally was ordered to a federal camp in Ashland, Ky., but
that facility was still under construction, so he was reassigned to
Marion.

   Soldiers held their children tight, military wives shopped with
tears in their eyes and at least one bride was left at the altar as
U.S. troops were mobilized to help Saudi Arabia defend a possible
attack by Iraq.
   Pfc. Mark Ohmer, a member of Fort Bragg's 82nd Airborne
Division's chemical unit, was to marry Angela Nelson, 19, on
Saturday in suburban Detroit. The $6,000 wedding was postponed when
he was called back to the North Carolina base to prepare to leave
for Saudi Arabia.
   ``It's scary _ not just for my wedding, but for the country and
for all the soldiers who might have to go over there and fight,''
Nelson said. ``It happened so fast. I'm so upset.''
   In North Carolina, convenience store clerks said brisk sales of
chewing tobacco, batteries and insect repellent to somber soldiers
and their wives were sure signs Fort Bragg soldiers were ready to
go.
   ``A lot of fathers are coming in with their kids, holding them
real tight'' and many wives are in tears as they make their
purchases, said Effie Parsons, a clerk at the Short Stop
convenience store near the base.
   ``They are definitely going. There is no doubt in my mind that
this is another war,'' said Ms. Parsons, 23.
   President Bush ordered U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia to repel a
potential Iraqi attack. Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait last week.
   ``At my direction, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, as
well as key units of the United States Air Force, are arriving
today to take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia,'' Bush said
today. ``I took this action to assist the Saudi Arabian government
in the defense of its homeland.''
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
besides that division from Fort Bragg, they expected deployment of
the 24th Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. and the 101st
Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky. Elements of those three
units would be deployed with the 18th Airborne Corps, a control
unit at Fort Bragg that directs the combat divisions, the sources
said.
   Bush provided no estimate of the number of U.S. troops involved
in the deployment. But government sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said at least 5,000 ground troops were involved, along
with 140 sophisticated fighters and bombers.
   About 2,000 troops temporarily stationed at Fort Chaffee, Ark.,
for training were headed back to their home base at Fort Bragg
``because of the activities in Iraq,'' said base spokesman Cecil
Green.
   A task force of the 82nd Airborne Division had been
participating in a mock war scheduled to end Sunday, but the
exercise was cut short, he said.
   At Fort Campbell, a base spokesman said today that the 101st
Airborne had not been deployed to Saudi Arabia, but soldiers were
tensely awaiting word.
   ``I'm sure everybody that had access to a TV was watching
closely, or if they did not, listening to the radio,'' said public
affairs officer Bill Harralson.
   Soldiers on leave from the 24th Infantry Division at Fort
Stewart were summoned back Tuesday, but base officials refused to
say whether they were being sent to the Middle East.
   Spec. 4 Norman Aimes, 24, part of the infantry division, said he
was called back from leave in Utah.
   ``They called and said there is a 99 percent chance that we are
going,'' Aimes said Tuesday.
   Pentagon sources said today that a second Navy cruiser was added
to the Persian Gulf, bringing to nine the number of U.S. ships in
the strategic water way.
   The sources said the battleship Wisconsin, carrying cruise
missiles, was deployed Tuesday night and that President Bush
planned to send F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft. Already deployed
were five AWACs reconnaisance planes, government officials said.
   Navy and government officials downplayed the possibility of a
blockade or military involvement for sailors aboard the USS
Saratoga, which set out Tuesday from the Mayport Naval Station near
Jacksonville, Fla.
   But the possibility of action was on the minds of many family
members as the huge aircraft carrier set out.
   ``I hope we get involved. I hope so. Maybe we can straighten out
the situation out there. Maybe they need us to go in and kick
butt,'' said Wendy Hunter, holding her 8-month-old son, Jonathan.
   Her husband, Paul, is aboard the Saratoga, which was joined by a
small support flotilla that included the guided missile cruiser
Philippine Sea, the destroyers Spruance and Sampson, and the
frigate Elmer Montgomery.
   In Washington state, four Navy squadrons with more than 950 men
from Whidbey Island Naval Air Station were aboard the three
aircraft carriers in or heading for the gulf, said base spokesman
Howard Thomas.

   Kidnappers freed a Swiss Red Cross worker
in Lebanon today and handed him over to Syrian authorities, a
Syrian official said.
   Reporters were summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Damascus for
the imminent handover of the hostage to Swiss officials.
   There was no immediate word on the identity of the hostage, one
of two Red Cross workers kidnapped 10 months ago in Sidon in
southern Lebanon.
   It was the first breakthrough in the hostage situation since
April, when two American hostages were freed.
   A group calling itself the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads had
said in a statement released late Tuesday that it would free the
two hostages within 24 hours. It was not known why only one hostage
was expected in Damascus.
   The statement, delivered to the independent newspaper An-Nahar
and a Western news agency, came with a photograph of captive
Emanuel Christen. He appeared with short hair, a clipped beard and
a mustache and looked straight into the camera.
   Christen, 33, was kidnapped Oct. 6 along with Elio Erriquez, 24,
outside the artificial limbs center in south Lebanon's port city of
Sidon, where the two worked as orthopedic technicians. Sidon is 25
miles south of Beirut.
   It was the first claim of responsibility for the kidnapping of
the two Swiss men by a group since their abduction.
   Police in Sidon had blamed their abduction on the
Libyan-financed Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction, led by
Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal. But the group had
denied the charge.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction has reportedly been
undergoing bloody internal purges over the past year.
   The statement said the decision to free the Red Cross captives
came in response to the wishes of Syrian President Hafez Assad,
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and Algerian President Chadli
Bendjedid.
   Christen and Erriquez have been among 16 foreigners held hostage
in Lebanon since March 1985. The others are six Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Two American hostages were released within a week of one another
in April.
   The statement also said the group had guarantees that their
demands would be met, but did not specify what the demands were.
   The longest held foreign hostage is Terry Anderson, 42, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>NASA Says Mirror For Weather Satellite Warps In Sunlight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mirrors being built for a $747 million series
of weather satellites have been found to warp and become useless in
the temperature extremes of space, NASA officials said Wednesday.
   The problem marks the second time in recent months that a NASA
project has been seriously affected by failed mirror technology.
Engineers found in June that a mirror aboard the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope was ground to the wrong specifications and
produces only a blurred visual image.
   A spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said the new flaw was discovered by ITT Aerospace, a
subcontractor for the project, and that the planned weather
satellites can not be completed and launched until a solution is
found.
   ``The visual images from these mirrors would be pretty close to
useless,'' said Bryan Dunbar, a space agency spokesman.
   The mirrors are being built for a satellite to be launched in
February, 1992 as the first of five in a series of robot weather
observers.
   Dunbar said engineers for NASA, ITT and Ford Aerospace, the
prime contractor, are scrambling to correct the problem in time for
the 1992 launch and it is possible that there could be no delay if
a solution is found quickly.
   Managers of the NASA program were not available for comment,
Dunbar said.
   Officials said the problem occurs only when the 12-by-20-oval
mirrors are exposed to the intense light of the sun in space.
   Dunbar said tests in a vacuum chamber showed that intense
sunlight, such as experienced by satellites in orbit, can warp the
mirrors. That distorts images that the mirrors reflect into
instruments aboard the satellite.
   NASA is supervising construction of the weather satellites for
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Frank
Lepore, a NOAA spokesman. He said the space agency builds and
launches the satellites and that the weather bureau takes over the
operation once the craft are at geostationary orbit 22,300 miles
above the Earth.
   The weather craft scheduled for launch in 1992 is to supplement
the single satellite that NOAA now has for cloud cover observations
over the United States.
   Lepore said that the current satellite, called GOES 7, was moved
over the center of the U.S. after GOES 6 failed last year. He said
the weather bureau prefers to have satellites over both coasts so
the craft can observe ocean storm fronts far from U.S. shores.
   The weather satellites take pictures of the cloud cover that are
commonly published in newspapers and broadcast on television.
   Dunbar said that the mirrors for the new series of weather
satellites are made of berylium metal coated with nickel. The
reflective surface is then coated with aluminium and silicone
dioxide.
   He said that after two mirrors were made, ITT discovered in a
computer simulation that the mirrors would warp when exposed to
direct sunlight in space. ITT then tested the computer model in a
vacuum chamber and confirmed the problem, Dunbar said.
   The new weather satellites are to have two of the 12-by-20-inch
mirrors. One will be used to reflect cloud cover images in visible
light to a camera. The other will be reflect light to an infrared
detector which can then determine temperatures in the lower 10
miles of the atmosphere.

   East German lawmakers on Wednesday voted
against immediately unifying with West Germany but said the
historic merger should take place on Oct. 14.
   Under the proposal, the first united German elections in almost
60 years would be held on that date and formal unity would take
place either immediately before or after the balloting.
   The vote sets the stage for a pivotal showdown Thursday in the
West German Parliament, which must approve the constitutional
changes needed to allow elections to take place so quickly.
   Opposition Social Democrats in West Germany have vowed to block
those changes, which require a two-thirds majority in the lower
house of Parliament, the Bundestag.
   The Christian Democrats of East German Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl want unification
and united German elections on Oct. 14.
   Social Democrats, the second-largest parties in both nations,
want unification alone on Sept. 15 and elections on Dec. 2.
   Kohl needs the approval of the Social Democrats to substantially

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from President Hosni
Mubarak's nationally televised speech Wednesday on Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   Brothers, our country and the Arab nation are passing through
very difficult and complicated circumstances. You are used to me
talking with you with complete honesty about any internal or
external event which affects Egypt or Arab national security...
   Today, I find myself obliged to warn of the extreme danger... We
have to consider with concern and extreme care the disastrous
effects that it could have if it continues...
   I am neither biased to this side or that. I do not want it
misunderstood that I am biased to the Kuwaiti side against Iraq. it
is a matter of principles. Egypt has its principles and positions
and these positions cannot be sold for money ...
   The problem started with the border problem between Iraq and
Kuwait. This border dispute goes back long years ... Kuwait should
have moved and tried to resolve it...
   I held long talks with our brother President Saddam (Hussein of
Iraq). I asked him outright if his troops were moving toward
Kuwait, and his told me these were just routine movements and that
the troops were 70 kilometers (about 40 miles) away from the
border. I asked him if he intended to attack, and he told me no, he
told me that he had had enough, and I said good, then we can work
on finding a compromise...
   (Later) They told me Iraq had invaded Kuwait and that paralyzed
my thoughts. I am a military man and know how these things develop.
I woke up , still finding it hard to believe it was happening to
two Arab sisters ... I was dazed ....
   (The day of the invasion) King Hussein said he would pass by me.
We sat and talked and I told him the situation was very serious. We
decided that no one wants an Arab summit because we would only sit
and curse each other. I said to him, King Hussein, ``I am afraid of
the consequences of this. It will be destructive and will put the
Arab nation on the spot and our position will be very bad.'' I told
him to go to talks with President Saddam, and stress two points ...
1. The necessity for the immediate withdrawal from Kuwait and 2.
The necessity for Iraq to stop overthrowing other regimes by force
because it is not its responsibility. It is the right of the
people...
   I told him if the need arises, Egypt will join in forming an
Arab force to serve as a buffer zone between the two sides ...
   The crisis has become internationalized. The Arab League Council
condemned the invasion ... the Organization of Islamic Conference
also issued a similar condemnation, as did the Gulf Cooperation
Council. We were here, snapping at each other, while the Security
Council met and condemned the Iraqi invasion and demanded the
withdrawal of the Iraqi troops. The Security Council was ahead of
us as though the crisis was not Arab, as though the Arabs are a
dead body which does not want to move. After that, the Security
Council met again and issued a more severe statement, banning the
exports of any Iraqi or Kuwaiti products and banning the sale of
anything to Iraq and Kuwait. It was like a seige ... and if this
siege does not produce any results, they move to article number 42
which is a military siege and the use of military force. And we
were still sitting and watching...
   The Canadian prime minister and the American President Bush and
French President Mitterrand and Turkey and Britain, they all
contacted me and said a siege is inevitable. I tried to convince
them to give us a chance. I told President Bush to give us a
chance, but he said he would issue the sanctions ...
   The issue is grave. The situation is grave and the European
countries are moving. You (Saddam) said you would not strike and
you struck. And now you are turning to Saudi Arabia and saying ``I
will not strike.'' They will not believe you. Do you think they
will wait until disaster strikes them too? We can see in the world
news, American planes and British vessels. The world is moving
freely in the region. I told our brothers in Iraq and I will tell
you, this is not a secret, this is my estimation of the situation...
   I tell you my point of view as a former military man. I am
afraid that Iraq will be struck by a harsh strike from different
sides. Don't think that the fleets are just going to sit there
sleeping. This is just my personal point of view. I have not
received any information that there is an attack coming. It is
clear to me that there is an attack coming, and it could be
destructive and frightening...
   You (Saddam) are not accepting the Arab umbrella. Well, you are
getting the foreign umbrella. American and French and British and
other forces are being forced on you. ...
   Isn't it more honorable for us to solve our problems in the
framework of an Arab umbrella. Isn't it more honorable for us to
listen to the sound of reason between each other. I think the
situation is very grave. Today, fighter bombers went to an Arab
country. An aircraft carrier passed (through the Suez Canal.)
Someone might ask me to stop the aircraft carrier, but I cannot
stop it. According to the (international) agreement ... I cannot
stop anyone from passing through the canal except if I am at war
with him.
   You (Saddam) cannot put me in a bind like this. You cannot
commit such a crime and then ask me for the impossible. Don't
embarrass me. Just like you have interests, I have interests. I am
trying as much as possible to protect Arab honor ...
   Everyone will ask for foreign troops after this. There is talk
that Egyptian forces went to protect there (Saudi Arabia.) We have
no troops there. We are not preparing troops and there is no talk
about this. But, I tell you honestly, if we are asked to
participate with Arab troops as a safeguard, I do not think Egypt
would object to this. Arab joint troops. I am not participating
with foreign troops. We hope to resolve this crisis with an Arab
solution. In all truth, the picture I see is black...
   The picture is frightening and if we do not contain the
situation and move very quickly, we will no longer have a standing
and we will be dead bodies and military powers will force things on
us and will have their own way ...
   From this stand, I call on President Saddam and the Iraqi
leadership to respond to an Arab umbrella and withdraw its forces
from Kuwait and restore the legitimacy of Kuwait. It is also
possible to have joint Arab forces to stand between the two sides
until negotiations start to resolve the issue. I am sure that the
Arab leadership will reach a solution to this problem. At the same
time, time is running out very quickly and events are happening
quicker than our movements.
   I call for an emergency Arab summit within 24 hours, or even
within a few hours. It would be better than having a solution
forced on us by foreign powers. I hope Arab presidents and kings
will respond to this appeal and I am ready in this case to host the
Arab summit in Egypt, hoping that we reach a solution before
something we do not like or accept happens.
   National security is in danger and Iraq is in danger. They may
say no, but this is my point of view ...
   It will not be an Arab summit to exchange curses or tear each
others clothes. But it will be to solve our problem in the Arab
framework which is more honorable to the Arab nation.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, driven by America's thirst for
oil, has undertaken the riskiest gamble of his administration by
sending U.S. forces to a faraway faceoff with one of the world's
most dangerous leaders.
   Other American presidents have painfully learned that the Middle
East can become a graveyard for U.S. servicemen, a prison for
hostages and a sand trap for politicians.
   Bush acknowledged that the United States may have to pay a big
price to stop Iraq's Saddam Hussein from plundering Saudi Arabia
and its vast oil reserves.
   ``Standing up for our principles will not come easy,'' Bush
cautioned the nation in a speech Wednesday from the Oval Office.
``It may take time and possibly cost a great deal.''
   Bush, politically strong at home, has received strong
international support for his campaign to drive Saddam's troops
from Kuwait and keep them out of neighboring Saudi Arabia, the
largest single supplier of U.S. oil.
   In contrast to his normal caution, Bush decisively imposed U.S.
economic sanctions and an oil boycott against Iraq and then rallied
other world leaders to do the same.
   So far, so good.
   In times of crisis, ``Americans are quick to support a president
and rally around the flagpole in a nationalistic way,'' said
Colorado College political scientist Tom Cronin.
   ``However, Americans find fault with a president when casualties
occur, when hostages are taken and when maneuvers seem to backfire
or are inept,'' Cronin added. ``The risk is even greater (in the
Middle East) because we are under severe limitations of weather,
language, distance and because of Arab animosity toward the United
States.''
   The danger of hostage-taking is real. There are an estimated
3,000 Americans in Kuwait and 500 in Iraq who are vulnerable to
Saddam's whims. ``What he does, that's a bit unpredictable,'' Bush
acknowledged.
   Even for a superpower like the United States, Saddam is a
formidable foe.
   His million-man force, hardened by eight years of war with Iran,
is the fourth largest army in the world. It is armed with more than
5,600 tanks, over 500 combat aircraft and a horrifying arsenal of
chemical weapons that Saddam has been willing to use, even against
his own countrymen.
   Ruthless and unpredictable, Saddam has proven his willingness to
fight, not only with helpless neighbors such as Kuwait but with
well-armed adversaries such as Iran.
   ``It's not a country that bluffs,'' said Judith Kipper, a Middle
East expert at the Brookings Institution. ``There's no subtlety
here. He's (Saddam) not somebody who puts troops on a border to
wink and blink.''
   Despite the hazards, Bush's hand was forced by America's
addiction to foreign oil, which accounts for 50 percent of the
petroleum used in the United States.
   Iraqi control of Saudi Arabia would give Saddam the unacceptable
power to control oil supplies and prices. Bush said Iraq's
aggression could pose a major economic threat to the United States,
which already has been edging toward a recession.
   If a recession comes now, Bush at least can blame Saddam.
   Even while confronting the Iraqi leader, Bush said U.S. troops
would be used solely to prevent an invasion of Saudi Arabia, not to
drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. For now, that second step is just
too big, Bush judged. He expressed hope that global economic
sanctions would impel Saddam to bring his troops home.
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf puts a spotlight on Bush's
reluctance in recent months to try to restrain Saddam despite many
warning signs of menacing intentions.
   The White House opposed congressional efforts to impose
sanctions on Iraq and argued it could win Saddam over by diplomacy.
   ``The fact is, it didn't work,'' conceded White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We did the best we could.''
   There also are lingering questions about the effectiveness of
Bush's policy toward the Middle East, where the president has been
frustrated time and again in efforts to win a broad peace agreement.
   ``We have not had a regional policy,'' said the Brookings'
Kipper. ``We have tended to always look at this through the prism
of the Arab-Israeli conflict.''
   Suggesting a broader perspective, she said, ``We ought to look
at it through an aerial view, a satellite view. ... That's been our
failure, the failure of the Bush administration.''

   Iraq today annexed Kuwait, the emirate it overran six days ago,
and defied ``all the fleets and squadrons of aircraft'' of a
U.S.-led force. Arab nations balked at challenging Iraq militarily,
opting instead for more diplomacy.
   U.S. troops were deployed to protect Iraq's neighbor, Saudi
Arabia, in what Washington calls a multinational effort.
   But so far only Britain has agreed to send troops, though other
nations have agreed to provide support. The Arab states of Egypt
and Morocco declined to participate, despite U.S. reports that they
would. An Arab summit meeting on the crisis was scheduled for
Thursday in Cairo.
   President Bush, in a nationally broadcast speech, confirmed U.S.
forces were dispatched to the troubled region. But he said: ``We're
not at war.''
   Meanwhile, the economic and military noose slowly tightened
around Iraq. Turkey shut down the Iraqis' vital oil outlet to the
Mediterranean, honoring a U.N. trade embargo ordered to punish Iraq
for its takeover of Kuwait. One published report said the Saudis
had agreed to boost their oil output.
   Diplomats were working to arrange for the evacuation of
foreigners stranded in Kuwait and Iraq, including thousands of
Americans. It was unclear whether the Iraqis would allow all who
wanted to leave.
   Iraq, in a statement by its official Iraqi News Agency monitored
in Cyprus, said its formal takeover of Kuwait came at the request
of the provisional government it installed in the emirate last week.
   ``The Revolutionary Command Council has decided to return the
branch, Kuwait, to the whole and to the Iraq of its origins in a
comprehensive and eternal merger,'' the statement said. Iraq has
long laid claim to Kuwaiti territory, and cited those claims as
among the reasons for its invasion.
   Earlier, an announcement on Iraqi radio and television indicated
the annexation was imminent, calling Kuwait ``part of Iraq.'' The
later Iraqi statement warned that outside military intervention
would be useless.
   ``All the evil and all the conspirators, all the fleets and
squadrons of aircraft, all the centers of brute force inside or
outside the Arab homeland will not shake a single palm frond in
Basra ... Kuwait or Ahmadi,'' the Iraqi statement said. Mina
al-Ahmadi is Kuwait's main oil-loading terminal. Basra is a key
port on the Shatt-al-Arab in southern Iraq.
   Saudi rulers have never before allowed U.S. troops onto their
soil, and sources had said Arab participation in the multinational
effort was a Saudi condition for doing so. But Morocco and Egypt
denied U.S. reports their troops would participate.
   The fact that the Saudis are allowing in U.S. forces and
warplanes indicates they consider Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein,
to harbor further expansionist intentions.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called in a nationally
televised speech for an emergency Arab summit. His spokesman,
Mohammed Abdel-Moneim, later said the meeting will be held in Cairo
on Thursday evening.
   Abdel-Moneim did not give the exact number of Arab countries
that had accepted Mubarak's summit proposal. But he said they
included Saudi Arabia, Syria, Algeria, Djibouti, the United Arab
Emirates, Yemen, Libya and Qatar.
   Bush provided no estimate of the number of U.S. troops involved
in the deployment. But government sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said at least 5,000 ground troops were involved, along
with 140 sophisticated fighters and bombers. Cruise missiles
programmed to hit specific Iraqi sites were aboard a battleship
that set out on a week's journey to the Middle East.
   Today's Iraqi announcement said the Baghdad-backed provisional
government of Kuwait yearned ``to achieve complete unity between
Kuwait and Iraq, and for the hero Saddam Hussein to be our leader
and protector.''
   Iraq says it invaded to support a new government by
``revolutionary youth'' who had toppled Kuwait's rulers, but
diplomats have called that a farce.
   Iraq had already announced that Kuwait's currency was being
linked on a one-to-one basis to the Iraqi dinar, in another sign of
imminent annexation.
   On Tuesday, Saddam said his people ``would rather die than be
humiliated'' and threatened to ``pluck out the eyes of those who
attack the Arab nation.''
   ``No one should underestimate our determination to confront
aggression,'' Bush said in a nationally broadcast address on the
crisis. ``If history teaches us anything, it is that we must resist
aggression or it will destroy us.''
   
   Reports today by The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN
and others quoted intelligence sources as saying Iraqi forces
appeared to be loading poison gas munitions aboard combat aircraft.
That was said to have sealed the decision to deploy U.S. troops.
   Iraq did not hesitate to use chemical weapons during its
eight-year war with Iran and against its Kurdish minority.
   U.S. troops and warplanes, ordered on Tuesday to guard oil-rich
Saudi Arabia against Saddam's million-man army, would be part of a
multinational force, which sources said was a condition set by the
Saudis.
   In addition to Mubarak's denial that Egypt was participating,
the Morocaan news agency MAP said Morocco would not participate in
the multinational effort. Mubarak said Egypt would consider acting
in an Arab force.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney returned to Washington today after
a two-day swing to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Morocco. After Cheney's
visit to Saudi Arabia, Bush administration officials said the
Saudis had agreed to increase oil production by 2 million barrels a
day, The New York Times reported today. Such a move would help
offset the reduction in world supplies.
   Meanwhile, Britain announced today that it will send unspecified
naval and air force units to join the multinational force.
   ``The multinational effort is designed to deter Hussein. If Iraq
compounds this with a fresh act of aggression, it will be extremely
expensive, damaging and destructive to Iraq,'' Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd said in London.
   The multinational force would be far outnumbered by the
estimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers reported to have massed on
Kuwait's southern border, but is seen as a symbol of U.S.
commitment to Saudi defense.
   As part of the Bush administration's mobilization of forces to
the tense region, a U.S. carrier group passed through the Suez
Canal en route to the Red Sea today and a new U.S. Navy task force
set sail from Florida.
   Iraq overran Kuwait after threatening its small neighbor for
weeks over a border dispute. Baghdad also said Kuwait's violation
of OPEC oil-production quotas amounted to economic war because
overproduction kept oil prices down.
   The conquest of Kuwait drove oil prices up by about 30 percent
and gave Iraq control of 9 percent of world daily oil production.
   If Iraq were to conquer Saudi Arabia, it would raise its share
of world oil production to almost 20 percent.
   But oil prices sank today in London in what traders said
reflected confidence that there would be enough world oil
production to make up for supplies lost in the wake of the Iraqi
invasion.
   Meanwhile, many governments were drawing up regulations to
enforce the anti-Iraq trade embargo ordered Monday by the U.N.
Security Council at Washington's urging. If fully enforced, the
boycott could cripple Iraq, which depends heavily on its oil
exports for economic survival.
   In Saudi Arabia, the Iraqi oil flow was reported slowing to a
trickle through a pipeline on Saudi territory because of the drop
in demand due to the embargo. But the Saudis did not immediately
announce a shutoff of the pipeline, apparently not wanting to give
Saddam a pretext to invade.

   Tamil rebels opened fire on a bus
Wednesday, killing at least 27 civilians, and hacked to death 27
other people in a village raid, military officials said.
   The rebels, battling for an independent homeland, raided
Bandaraduwa village in eastern Ampara district late Tuesday and
killed 27 villagers, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   First report of the killings came from four injured villagers
who arrived at a military camp in Ampara seeking medical help. The
town is is 135 miles east of Colombo.
   In the other attack, Tamil rebels stopped a bus Wednesday and
gunned down at least 27 Sinhalese at Mahadivulkewa village in
northeastern Trincomalee district, said the officials. The area is
125 miles northeast of Colombo.
   It was the fourth massacre by Tamil rebels since Friday, when
they stormed two mosques and killed 140 Moslem worshippers in
eastern Batticaloa district.
   On Sunday, at least 50 Moslems were hacked and shot to death by
the rebels in three separate villages in Ampara district. It was
not immediately known if the village and bus victims were also
Moslems.
   The militants accuse Moslems of backing the government in the
civil war. Moslems, who account for about 7 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people, claim neutrality.
   The rebels say their minority Tamil community is discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese. Tamils form 18 percent the
population of Sri Lanka, while Sinhalese make up 75 percent.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-old ethnic
conflict in this nation.

   Andrew Young's crusade to become the Georgia's
first black governor foundered in a tidal wave of white votes. But
there was almost certainly more to it than that.
   Young was late to go on television, late to articulate his
message, late to give Georgia Democrats a good enough reason to
turn their backs on Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, a populist they'd been
electing and re-electing for 16 years.
   Miller buried Young _ 68 percent to 32 percent _ in Tuesday's
Democratic primary runoff and will meet Republican state Rep.
Johnny Isakson in November. Democratic Gov. Joe Frank Harris was
barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term.
   ``American politics is complex,'' Young said Wednesday. ``It's
an insult to try to break it down as racial. It's not as simple as
that.''
   Young's campaign manager, Hobby Stripling, a white small-town
mayor from southern Georgia, conceded Wednesday that Miller had
effectively zoomed past the field before anyone figured out quite
what was going on. ``Zell ran a very good campaign,'' he said.
   Miller declared his candidacy two years out, immediately
dominating the race. His television advertising was clever and
sharply focused. He said he'd bring Georgia a state lottery to
benefit education. He said he'd put drug criminals in boot-camp
prisons.
   Young, the former Atlanta mayor, congressman and ambassador to
the United Nations, didn't announce until January. He didn't go on
TV until June. His first ads were bland and inoffensive, mostly
scenes of Young in an integrated classroom telling Georgians that,
yes, he was pro-education.
   He spent much of the time leading up to the July 17 primary in
white, rural southern Georgia, preaching his message of economic
development. In two terms as mayor, he had brought jobs and
prosperity to Atlanta, and he would do it for Thomasville and
Moultrie and Waynesboro.
   ``He believes very strongly in the economics of the world,''
Stripling said. ``It was very hard for him not to deal with that
issue. He likes that issue.
   ``But the average voter just didn't give a damn.''
   Some black leaders grumbled that Young was taking his base _ the
black vote _ for granted, while pushing a traditional white
pro-business campaign.
   He hit snags cultivating what politicians call ``free media,''
too.
   Reporters following Young swapped stories about how many times
they were unable to reach his press staff.
   The day before the runoff, Young's plane was filled with four
staff members and two reporters, while Miller hauled at least three
TV crews around the state.
   Young insisted more than once that his money was going to
get-out-the-vote efforts, rather than TV advertising. But in black
neighborhoods, his historic campaign failed to turn out as many
voters as Jesse Jackson did in 1988.
   And finally, Young came as close Wednesday as he will likely
ever come to conceding that yes, there was a little bit of racism
involved.
   ``I don't think there'll ever be a colorless campaign,'' he
said. ``I think we can be comfortable enough with our differences
to not let that influence us too much.''
   Young polled 80 or more of the black vote, according to the
votes from some key precincts. But in some white counties, he lost
by a margin of nearly 20-to-1.
   In other elections Tuesday, Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden, seeking a
second term, edged real estate executive Nestor Weigand Jr. in a
six-way Republican primary. State Treasurer Joan Finney won the
Democratic nomination, upsetting former Gov. John Carlin.
   Michigan Republicans chose Sen. John Engler over General Motors
engineer John Lauve to challenge two-term Democrat James Blanchard
for governor. In a race for the Senate, Republican Rep. Bill
Schuette defeated lawyer Clark Durant for the right to oppose
Democrat Carl Levin, who is seeking a third term.
   In Missouri, Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader,
won the Democratic nomination for an eighth term, trouncing
Nicholas F. Clement, a newspaper carrier who is a follower of
extremist Lyndon LaRouche.

<HEAD>Anti-Abortion Group Targets American Express for Boycott</HEAD>

   Anti-abortion activists said Wednesday they
would boycott American Express and 43 other companies that donate
funds to Planned Parenthood.
   Leaders of the Christian Action Council said the move follows a
letter-writing campaign in which companies were asked to withdraw
support from Planned Parenthood because abortions are performed at
its clinics.
   The organization said the businesses should ``stay out of and
keep out of the abortion business.''
   The Christian Action Council said it was focusing its first
boycott attempt on American Express because that company is widely
known, not because it donated the most money.
   American Express spokeswoman Toni Maloney said the firm has not
taken a stand on abortion.
   ``We give to a lot of various projects that basically meet the
themes of community service and education,'' she said. ``We gave
two modest grants to Planned Parenthood projects in 1989 and we
felt that both of those fell into those categories.''
   Maloney said American Express had not yet made a 1990 grant to
Planned Parenthood. ``But this year is only half over and last
year's donations were made late in the year,'' she said.
   David Andrews, vice president of Planned Parenthood of America,
said of the boycott threat, ``American Express is a very
sophisticated corporation and they're not going to be pushed around
by the CAC.''
   The Christian Action Council had been pursuing a letter-writing
campaign asking companies to withdraw support from Planned
Parenthood because abortions are performed at its clinics.
   The group said its actions led American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. to withdraw its support for Planned Parenthood, beginning in
1991, and that at least 10 other companies had followed AT&amp;T's lead.
   ``Letters were sent pointing out to AT&amp;T that it was, in a
sense, shooting itself in the foot by supporting an agency that
kills its future customers,'' said Joe Scheidler of the Pro-Life
Action League.
   Andrews said he knew of no other businesses that had withdrawn
financial support from Planned Parenthood.
   ``I think that AT&amp;T's withdrawal of support backfired not only
on AT&amp;T but also on the CAC. We got thousands of new donors after
that,'' he said. ``Most corporations don't appreciate any interest
group like the CAC trying to dictate their corporate support.''
   Maloney said American Express was concerned about card holder
complaints. ``We have received calls both for and against our
support of Planned Parenthood,'' she said. ``We know that we cannot
please everyone all the time.''
   The CAC says companies will be removed from its boycott list
once they pledge to withdraw support or if support has not been
given for more than five years.

   Patti Davis, a frequent critic of her father's
government, blames the Reagan administration for the slaughter of
thousands of dolphins.
   In a report for the syndicated television series ``A Current
Affair,'' Davis traces the slaughter of dolphins _ many caught in
tuna nets _ to among, other things, her father's administration.
   ``My sense of grief and helplessness increased when I learned
that the Reagan administration had allowed 20,500 dolphins a year
to be killed, contrary to the intent of the Marine Mammal
Protection Act,'' she said.
   Davis, 37, the daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, has been an
actress, singer, writer and environmental activist, clashing with
her parents on many issues.
   The report is to air Friday.

   Singer Bonnie Raitt donated her concert

out of western New York, a group official said Wednesday.
   Raitt also promised that her road manager would match her $2,000
contribution, said James Weiss, co-chairman of Citizen's Against
Radioactive Dumping. Two sites in Cortland County were under
consideration for the dump.
   Raitt, who won a Grammy last year for her album ``Nick of

Finger Lakes Performing Arts Center in Canandaigua.
   ``Don't ever allow the state to dump radioactive waste in any of

   Weiss said the singer spoke with CARD members who had set up a
table outside the arts center and gave them a check after the show.

   Actor William Shatner, the unflappable Capt.
James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise, says bad reviews shake
him up.
   Critics castigated last year's ``Star Trek V,'' blaming the
film's creative and box office failure on Shatner's direction, so
he was apprehensive about literary reviews of his first book.
   ``In this business, we all want to be loved, and when someone
says they don't like your work, they're saying, in effect, that
they don't like you, so you suffer for it,'' he said in a recent
interview.
   Reviews of Shatner's futuristic cop thriller ``Tekwar,''
published late last year with the paperback released a week ago,
were generally favorable.
   He decided to ``throw caution to the wind'' and write the book
because he was familiar with science fiction and police work,
Shatner said. He starred in the ``T.J. Hooker'' cop series.
   ``So I took a cop I've played and put him in the future. Then, I
took a subject that was in the news, drugs, and put it in the book.
Then, to keep costs down in case it's made into a movie, I set most
of the action in the forests of Mexico.''

   Film star Gerard Depardieu was fined $1,800 and his
license was suspended for six months for driving while drunk. He
was arrested after a car accident that injured two people.
   Depardieu, who won best-actor award at the Cannes Film Festival
this year for his title role in ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' also was
sentenced Wednesday to a two-month suspended prison sentence.
   Depardieu, 41, did not attend the court proceeding in Riom. His
lawyer, Serge Teillot, said the actor ``fully acknowledged his
responsibility'' but felt the proceedings would be more calm if he
did not attend.
   Prosecutors said Depardieu's blood contained twice the legal
alcohol limit of 0.08 percent after the July 20 accident, which
occurred as the actor drove to a hotel after shooting scenes for a
new movie.
   His car collided with another on a country road near
Puy-de-Dome, slightly injuring the wife and daughter of the other
driver.
   Depardieu told police he was trying to answer a call on his car
telephone and was blinded by the setting sun when the crash
occurred.

<HEAD>Brady: Higher Oil Prices Needn't Cause Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said
Wednesday that oil price shocks need not topple the economy into a
recession, but he called on the Federal Reserve to stimulate growth
with lower interest rates.
   ``We are not contemplating recession,'' Brady said after a
luncheon speech to the National Press Club.
   ``Certainly the events of last week, where the price of oil has
gone up, are going to impose additional hardships on the country,''
he said. ``But I don't think we should come to judgment quickly.''
   However, Brady said he and President Bush want the Federal
Reserve to give economic growth a boost by lowering interest rates.
He said strong growth was particularly important now, when the
United States was responding to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
   ``Everybody wants lower interest rates. ... At this point in
time in the United States, economic growth is very important,'' he
said.
   He expressed confidence that Federal Reserve policy makers, who
meet next on Aug. 21, would lower rates in response to sluggish
growth. The economy, as measured by the gross national product,
grew at an anemic 1.5 percent annual rate in the first half of 1990.
   ``We look for lower interest rates. ... The fact that the
country is faced with slower growth will almost certainly produce
lower interest rates,'' Brady said.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that economic growth was
slackening even before the price of crude oil soared from $20 a
barrel before last week's invasion of Kuwait to $28 after.
   In a July 27 survey of the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks,
``most noted that the pace was slow or had slackened recently,''
the central bank said in a report known as the ``beige book.''
   Richard W. Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said a recession is now unavoidable. The economic impact
of turmoil in the Persian Gulf is exacerbating the effects of the
Federal Reserve's tight money policy, he said.
   ``We anticipate that the economy will grind to a virtual
standstill during the third quarter of this year and actually
contract by 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter,'' he told a news
conference. ``Our forecast shows the economy continuing to
experience negative real growth in the first quarter of 1991 and
practically no growth in the second quarter.''
   On other topics, Brady said:
   _He did not know if oil companies were taking advantage of
consumers by raising gasoline prices so quickly after the invasion
of Kuwait, but said, ``If people are gouging ... those that are
doing the gouging will hear from the president.''
   _Budget deficit negotiations with Congress may produce a number
different from the $50 billion reduction goal, but that reducing
the deficit was more important now that the United States was
trying to exert its influence in the Persian Gulf.
   _The staggering cost of the savings and loan bailout ``frightens
politicians into finger-pointing and blame-avoiding.'' The
administration will ``rise above the political blame game,'' he
said, while ``the line in the political world goes, `Since I don't
make mistakes, someone else must be making them.''

<HEAD>Company Suspected of Working on Second Chemical Weapons Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A West German company involved in the
construction of a Libyan plant alleged to produce chemical weapons
may have supplied plans for a second such facility, prosecutors
said Wednesday.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, the head of the Imhausen-Chemie
company, was found guilty in June of shipping materials for the
Libyan plant. He was sentenced to five years in prison.
   Mannheim prosecutor Peter Wechsung said 80 police officers
raided various homes and offices Wednesday, seeking clues about the
latest suspicions regarding Imhausen-Chemie.
   Wechsung told The Associated Press that ``at the end of 1988,
when there were the first signs of the company's involvement in the
Libyan affair, the firm had already been at work on the second
facility.''
   According to prosecutors, the Imhausen company delivered the
plans for the second plant in violation of West Germany's export
laws.
   Wechsung, whose office has jurisdiction in the case, added that
Imhausen is suspected of having used federal research funds to pay
employees involved in the second project.
   The prosecutor did not say how far the second project may have
gotten, or where it was to have been located. He also did not say
what led officials to suspect that plans for a second plant were
under way.
   Suedwestfunk, the state radio station in southern
Baden-Wuerttemberg, said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi planned to
build it in Sabhah deep, in the desert. The first plant was built
in Rabta, about 50 miles from Tripoli.
   Disclosures about German involvement in the Rabta plant strained
relations between Washington and Bonn for several months starting
in December 1988.
   The United States alleged the plant was intended to produce
chemical weapons. Gadhafi denied it and said the plant was making
pharmaceuticals.
   On June 27, a Mannheim superior court found Hippenstiel-Imhausen
guilty of violating export laws and tax evasion in connection with
the plant at Rabta.
   Chief Judge Juergen Henniger said that based on the testimony of
expert witnesses, the court concluded that the Rabta plant ``was
clearly intended for the production of chemical warfare agents.''
   Henniger said the plant was capable of producing mustard gas and
other poison gases, and that Hippenstiel-Imhausen was aware of its
intended purposes.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen, 49, confessed in June to helping in
construction but said he did not know the plant was intended to
make poison gas.
   The Rabta plant was reportedly damaged by fire under mysterious
circumstances earlier this year.
   The United States initially said the blaze caused heavy damage
to the plant, but later news reports said U.S. officials believed
the fire was a hoax.

   Honorable citizens of Kuwait, dear kinfolk in great Iraq, O sons
of the glorious Arab nation: When the uprising in Kuwait took place
on August 2, the objective of the uprising was not just to remove a
regime, although it was a corrupt agent regime, and replace it with
a new national system.
   The objective from the very beginning was a big and historic
goal, a dear pan-Arab goal, through which we would rectify
comprehensively, eternally and radically what colonialism had
imposed on our country. Dear brothers, the crystal-clear historic
fact is that Kuwait is a part of Iraq. Its people are Iraqis, and
throughout their history they drank the waters of the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers; they grew up on the shores of the Shatt-al-Arab.
   The colonialism that partitioned the Arab homeland to secure
itself a foothold in the land of the Arabs, to exploit their
resources, and weaken them forever, is what created an artificial
entity called the state of Kuwait....
   The free provisional Kuwaiti government has decided to appeal to
our kinfolk in Iraq, the valiant men of al-Qadissiyah (a 7th
century Arab victory over the Persians), the honorable, generous,
chivalrous guards of the eastern gateway of the Arab homeland _ led
by the knight of the Arabs and the leader of their march, President
Field Marshal Saddam Hussein _ to agree that their sons should
return to their large family, that Kuwait should return to great
Iraq, the mother homeland, and to achieve a complete merger and
unity between Kuwait and Iraq, and for the hero Saddam Hussein to
be our leader and protector of our march as the president of the
Republic of Iraq, as he is the chairman of the (Iraqi)
Revolutionary Command Council....
   We look to your decision and your heed to our call so the
festival can be complete and so that jubilation may spread
throughout Iraq and the land of Arabism. We have relied on God; let
the faithful put their trust in God.
   Brothers in proud Iraq, this is our appeal and our decision.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of an Iraqi government announcement, also
broadcast by Baghdad radio, announcing that the merger has taken
place.
   In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. O great
Iraqi people from the land to the sea; O zealous Arabs everywhere;
scarce are the days when the Arabs are jubilant, when they are
joyous because of the meanings these days carry, and when they look
forward to the days to come....
   One of the most egregious criminal acts of colonialism was its
partition of the homeland, which was a single homeland the day
Baghdad was the capital of all Arabs. And following the
independence which Arab countries won, imperialism started
intensifying its malicious actions....
   Thus, the spiteful pencil and scissors of imperialism began to
draw up maps....
   In all cases, while drawing up geographic and sovereign
boundaries for all states, Western colonialism sought to make all
states weak and to ensure that partition, with the passage of time,
would prevent these states from closing ranks and demonstrating a
unified stance.
   Thus, colonialism achieved its objectives. The strongest
evidence to show its success is that it turned the Arab homeland
into 22 states ... by pursuing these methods, colonialism divested
the Arabs of not only the components of material capabilities, but
also of the components of spiritual progress.
   What has befallen other states in the Arab lands befell Iraq
when colonialism divested it of a dear part of it; namely Kuwait,
and kept Iraq away from the waters to prevent it from acquiring
part of its tactical and strategic abilities, and thus kept part of
its people and part of its wealth away from the origin and the
wellspring....
   Because the gates of the sky open up to the active and those of
goodwill and to the determination of the believers who reject
oppression, tyranny, and injustice, the gates of the sky opened up
to Iraq before the day of the call on 2nd August (the day of the
invasion of Kuwait) and to its detached part, Kuwait....
   Woe be to us from God's torture if we are late in performing our
duties toward him. Some of our duties to him and on his land are
struggle and jihad (holy war) for the sake of a deep pan-Arab
awakening which rectifies affairs and retrieves for the Arab
individual his status and leading role in the message of God and
life....
   Based on all this .... in view of what the situation has
resulted in after the Croesus entity (previous Kuwaiti government)
was shaken and after the earth under its feet and the feet of its
collaborators collapsed; with the objective of weakening the hopes
of the traitors and evildoers inside and outside the Arab homeland;
the Revolutionary Command Council has decided to return the branch,
Kuwait, to the whole, to the Iraq of its origins in a comprehensive
and eternal merger.

   In a separate report from the Iraqi News Agency, the
Revolutionary Command Council was quoted as saying in a statement:
   All the evil and all the conspirators, all the fleets and
squadrons of aircraft, all the centers of brute force inside or
outside the Arab homeland will not shake a single palm frond in
Basra ... Kuwait or Ahmadi.
   Mina al-Ahmadi is Kuwait's main oil-loading terminal. Basra is a
key port in southern Iraq.

   Oil futures prices fell and stocks built on early gains today as
speculators reacted to the movement of U.S. forces into Saudi
Arabia to defend against Iraqi threats to oil-producing nations
beyond Kuwait.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the cost of key West Texas
Intermediate crude for September delivery fell $2.35 to settle at
$25.96 a barrel. The contract had risen 26 cents in volatile
trading Tuesday to settle at its highest level since Dec. 6, 1985.
   Prices for unleaded gasoline and home heating oil were down by
more than 6 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said word that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other major
oil-producing nations would increase their output also worked to
suppress crude prices.
   Iraqi state television declared today that Kuwait is part of
Iraq and called for ``full unity between Kuwait and Iraq.'' An
unidentified announcer suggested that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein has no intention of giving up the emirate, which his troops
seized in a lightning raid on Thursday.
   Crude futures fell further following the announcement.
   The Iraqi statment came less than two hours after President Bush
told the American people that U.S. troops were taking up
``defensive positions'' in oil-rich Saudi Arabia to guard against a
possible attack by Iraq.
   Bush said he will ask other oil-producing nations to replace
embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil on world markets and explore
whether to dip into the nation's strategic reserves to bolster
supplies.
   Oil prices also sank in London. The spot price of Brent Bend,
the most widely traded international crude oil, fell $1.90 to
$25.50 a barrel.
   On Wall Street, stock prices inched higher as investors picked
over marked-down issues. The Dow Jones industrial average, which
lost 5.70 points on Tuesday for its sixth straight loss, rose 24.26
points to close at 2,734.90.
   Prices had plunged Monday and the Dow fell more than 93 points,
its worst one-day slide since the mini-crash of last October.
   In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded today and posted
its eighth-largest gain as traders taking advantage of the Persian
Gulf crisis went bargain hunting.
   But Persian Gulf war rumors depressed stock prices in London.
   The Nikkei Stock Average recouped 856.07 points, or 3.10
percent, ending the day at 28,509.14. It was the first gain since
July 31. Since Thursday, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the index has
dropped 3,184.92 points, or 11.5 percent.
   The Nikkei's rebound was helped by bargain-hunting in reaction
to Tuesday's big drop of 946.46 points, traders said. They said the
rebound also reflected stability in bond and currency markets.
   But stock prices turned lower at midday on the London Stock
Exchange as rumors swirled about hostilities in the Persian Gulf.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 8.6
points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,227.2.
   In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar was down against the
Japanese yen but up against most European currencies.
   The dollar fell 0.60 yen to 150.00 yen in Tokyo but was quoted
in London at 150.15 yen and still higher in early New York trading
at 150.33. The currency also rose against the German mark, the
British pound and the Swiss franc.
   In New York on Tuesday, war rumors sent jolts through U.S. stock
and bond markets and lifted oil prices to almost $29 a barrel,
their highest level in nearly five years.
   Each suggestion of a conflict sent oil prices higher and stocks
and bonds lower on the theory that oil-shock inflation would wallop
the already weak U.S. economy. Conversely, rumors that the
situation was easing weakened oil prices and sent money back into
the stock and bond markets.
   ``It's an emotional, volatile market,'' said William Veronda, a
strategist at the Denver investment firm Financial Programs Inc.
   Prices also fell Tuesday in the bond market, a barometer of
interest rates and economic health. The weakness especially
affected long-term bonds, reflecting fear that higher inflation
would erode their value.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell about $6 per $1,000
face amount, while its yield rose to 8.86 percent from 8.80 percent
late Monday.

   On Wednesday, Bush again addressed fears for the safety of the
stranded Americans _ 3,000 in Kuwait and 500 in Iraq. Protection of
their lives is a fundamental responsibility of the president, he
said.
   American officials, declining to refer to the Americans as
hostages, said they received conflicting signals from the Iraqis
about whether they would be allowed to leave.
   More than two dozen Americans were aboard an Iraqi Airways
jetliner that arrived in Jordan from Iraq Wednesday, a Jordanian
security official said. But a group of Americans earlier bused from
Kuwait to Baghdad by Iraqi authorities had been ordered to stay in
their hotel in the Iraqi capital, U.S. officials said.
   Back home, families waited nervously.
   ``She's still there, somewhere in Baghdad,'' Kevin York of Mount
Prospect, Ill., said of his wife, Faye, visiting relatives in Iraq.
``I want her to get out of there and get home, and then President
Bush and the rest can deal with it as they see fit. At that point,
I don't care.''
   Tens of thousands of Kuwaiti refugees have poured into Saudi
Arabia from their homeland, bearing tales of looting by Iraqi
soldiers and food shortages. In Baghdad, by contrast, the mood
appeared calm.
   ``Everything was perfectly normal ... no excitement, no fear or
anything,'' said British businessman Bryan Hume, who simply took a
taxi from Baghdad to Jordan late Tuesday.
   Some calm returned to world markets after days of distress.
   Stock indexes in Tokyo, London and New York were higher
Wednesday. Oil prices, which have shot up by one-third, fell for
the first time since the invasion of Kuwait.
   Governments were scrambling, meanwhile, to replace Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil supplies cut off by the U.N. embargo. Willing sellers
abounded.
   Venezuela, Nigeria and Iran all said they would boost production
to make up for any shortfalls. Although they did not announce it _
possibly to avoid antagonizing Iraq _ the Saudis were reported
ready to boost production by 2 million barrels a day, equal to
almost half of combined Iraq-Kuwait production.

   U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia are carrying
medical supplies to counter the effects of a possible Iraqi
chemical weapon attack, officials said Wednesday.
   There is no single antidote for all chemical warfare agents, but
the Army's Mark I kit issued to combat soldiers includes an
injectable antidote that counters the effects of nerve gas.
   The antidote is atropine, a common drug with a variety of
medical uses, said Mickey Morales of the Army's Chemical Warfare
Office at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Md.
   Iraq is believed to have blister agents and nerve agents.
Mustard gas, which Iraqi forces used on villagers during the
Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88, is a blister agent that kills by
chemically burning the skin and lungs and causing blisters to arise.
   Morales said combat soldiers also are issued an M17 kit, which
includes protective garments and some decontamination and detection
equipment. These garments cover the entire body. The kit includes a
mask designed to prevent inhalation of chemical, gas and biological
agents.
   There is also a March 258 kit, said Morales, that is used to
decontaminate skin and equipment. It can remove nerve and blister
agents.
   The Army also issues a hand-held device that can detect nerve or
blister gas, the concentration and the type of chemical. There are
also detectors that work from a distance and a vehicle device that
can sniff for chemical agents while the vehicle is in motion.

   Hundreds of radical students in Seoul
shouted ``Crush Yankees blocking national unification!'' and hurled
stones and firebombs at police Wednesday.
   There were no reports of injuries or arrests at the
demonstration.
   But in two southern cities, police arrested 21 youths at
anti-American demonstrations in front of U.S. facilities. The
protesters were demanding the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea.
   Also Wednesday, South Korea invited North Korean officials to a
meeting to exchange the names of the more than 56,000 people who
have asked to cross the common border when visits are permitted
next week.
   The clash in Seoul erupted when 700 students began hurling
stones and firebombs at police and attempted to march from Korea
University into eastern Seoul.
   About 1,000 riot police, armed with shields and clubs, sealed
two access roads to the school and fired tear gas at the students.
   The students claim that the U.S. troops in South Korea are an
obstacle to the reunification of South Korea and communist North
Korea.
   They also accused President Roh Tae-woo of manipulating the
issue of national unification to prop up his declining popularity.
   In Kwangju, an opposition stronghold 150 miles south of Seoul,
riot police arrested 11 student radicals and dissidents for trying
to storm a U.S. cultural center, the Yonhap News Agency reported.
   In another southern city, Pusan, police arrested 10 students for
illegally demonstrating in front of a U.S. military base, the South
Korean news agency reported. The agency said the students were
shouting `Yankees go home!''
   Protesters in both cities, identifying themselves as members of
a ``suicide squad for peaceful unification of the fatherland,''
demanded an end to the U.S. military presence in South Korea.
   Korean radicals have been calling for an end to the U.S.
military presence in South Korea and the signing of a peace treaty
to replace an armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.
   In a telephone message sent to his North Korean counterpart on
Wednesday, South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon suggested
that liaison officers from the two nations meet Thursday and Friday
at the border village of Panmunjom to discuss details of the border
crossings.
   South Korea has said it would open its border next week and
allow South Koreans to cross if their safe return is guaranteed.
   Seoul also said North Koreans would have virtually unlimited
access to travel in South Korea during the trial exchange.
   If the border opening occurs, it would be the first border
crossing since a small family exchange program in 1985.
   The two Koreas have not met to discuss procedures for the
proposed border opening and most observers doubt it will take
place. Both sides have charged the other with using the border
opening as propaganda.

<TEXT>
   A California congressman says that Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, far from being a disgrace
to his race as the congressman said last week, is above reproach.
   Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., delivered an apology in a
letter to Sullivan dated Monday.
   The existence of the letter was known Tuesday, but its contents
were not revealed.
   Neither Stark's office nor that of Sullivan would release copies
of the letter, but its text was made available Wednesday by
government sources who insisted on anonymity.
   ``I apologize to you for the inaccurate, inept, indefensible and
totally uncalled for remarks regarding you as a human and as a
professional,'' Stark wrote. ``On both counts you stand above
reproach. I hope you accept my apology.''
   Stark, chairman of the health subcommittee of the House Ways and
Means Committee, created a furor last Thursday when he said
Sullivan, who is black, was a disgrace to blacks because of his
support for Bush administration policies that Stark contended have
harmed minorities and the poor.
   Sullivan demanded an apology, saying, ``I don't work on Pete
Stark's plantation.''
   Stark told the House a day later that ``I blew it'' by referring
to Sullivan's race, but he stood by his complaint about Sullivan's
support for administration policies on abortion, discrimination,
health insurance and other issues. Sullivan declined to construe
those remarks as an apology.
   Sullivan referred to Stark's apology in a speech Tuesday to the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Richmond, Va.
   He said ``there is a rich, deep and vital diversity within the
black community. This diversity is one of our strengths, and we
don't need other people to tell us what to think.''
   Sullivan called Stark's remarks a ``public insult.'' But he said
that after receiving the apology, ``I consider this unfortunate
matter closed.''

<TEXT>
   An elderly recluse who couldn't make much
money growing apples found he had a green thumb in the stock
market. He left more than $812,000 in his will to help Washington
children.
   Stanislas Dumas, who never married and lived most of his life in
a ramshackle farmhouse, spent little and treated his stock earnings
like Monopoly money, his stock broker said Tuesday.
   Dumas left $812,295 to two hospitals and a trade school, said
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. broker Bruce Heiser, who also served as
Dumas' guardian.
   ``For him it was Monopoly money,'' Heiser said. ``He never took
a withdrawal from here.''
   ``He lived a very simple kind of life,'' said Heiser, who said
he became Dumas' best friend after they met in 1979.
   At the time of his death, Dumas owned only a few clothes, mostly
overalls, a rocking chair and bedroom set and a television sitting
on top of two apple boxes, Heiser said.
   ``He bought new cars and drank champagne,'' Heiser said. ``That
was the extent of his spending money.''
   Dumas would sock the meager earnings from his apple orchard into
stocks, and rode the bull market of the 1980s to huge profits,
Heiser said.
   Dumas died at age 85 in November 1988. The money from his will
was distributed last September.
   He left $325,000 to Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital's neonatal
unit, $162,295 to the Shriners' Hospital for Crippled Children in
Spokane and $325,000 to Perry Technical Institute in Yakima, Heiser
said.
   ``The different thing about this story is that the money didn't
end up under his mattress,'' said Heiser, 39. ``It ended up doing
something magnanimous.''
   Heiser said Dumas was born and died on a 30-acre apple farm
outside of Selah, just north of Yakima.
   Because Dumas never changed the farming techniques he learned
from his father, the small farm was never very profitable, Heiser
said. But because the farmer spent so little, he was able to save
money to purchase stocks beginning in 1921.
   Most of his life Dumas handled his stock transactions by
telephone with brokers in Seattle. The Seattle office passed the
account to Heiser in Yakima in 1979, when the portfolio was worth
$79,000 and mostly in South African gold stocks. They later
switched to oil stocks, then high-tech stocks, Heiser said.
   Dumas' investments are still coming in. Heiser recently located
$1,500 in a savings account that Dumas had forgotten, and checks
come in from a revolving fund at a fruit packing warehouse. That
money also goes to the institutions in Dumas' will.

   King Hussein warned Wednesday that a
planned Arab summit is ``the last chance'' to avert war over the
Kuwait crisis.
   The king of this Iraqi-aligned nation was asked at a crowded
news conference whether there would be a risk of war if the summit,
set for Thursday in Cairo, fails.
   ``There is a very rapid escalation and a very rapid
deterioration of the situation and we are very concerned over what
might happen. We will do our best so that the Arab world can stop
the slide,'' Hussein answered.
   Asked if he saw the summit as ``a last chance,'' he responded
somberly and without hesitation: ``Yes, I see it as a last chance.''
   Earlier in the news conference at Basman Palace, Hussein said
``the escalation of action and reaction could lead us to the verge
of disaster.''
   The king, who is not related to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
was dressed in a blue business suit and blue tie and spoke slowly
in English. His voice sounded tired.
   He kept repeating that Arabs themselves should settle the crisis
created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait without outside
intervention.
   Asked if he approved of U.S. troops being sent to Saudi Arabia
to shield the oil-rich kingdom from Iraqi attack, he said ``Saudi
Arabia is a sovereign state that can accept or seek any kind of
assistance that it believes it needs.
   ``It is not for me to say whether this is right or not. Time
will tell whether it was, or otherwise.''
   Referring to Iraq's announcement Wednesday of the merger of
Kuwait with Iraq, the Jordanian monarch said, ``Jordan is against
the acquisition of territory by war or any change as a result of
external pressure.''
   Jordan ``still recognizes the emirate regime in Kuwait,'' he
added.
   Saddam has declared that Kuwait's royal family wuld never be
allowed to return.
   The king made it clear that as a member of the United Nations,
Jordan would abide by the principles and decisions of the world
body. He did not specify, however, whether Jordan would implement
the mandatory sanctions against Iraq decreed by the Security
Council this week.
   He said the region was passing through ``a most dangerous
situation,'' adding that Jordan's army has been on partial alert
since the crisis began.
   ``This country is facing a danger, and I think this applies to
other Arab countries,'' he said.
   The king said he did not know how many Arab leaders would attend
the Cairo summit.
   Asked what Jordan would do ``in the final worst-case scenario
where war breaks out,'' he again expressed hope that the Arabs will
manage to settle the crisis themselves.
   He said he did not believe any danger existed of anti-American
riots breaking out in Jordan.
   ``I believe that the Jordanian people have confidence in their
leadership,'' he said.
   The Moslem Brotherhood Movement, the strongest bloc in Jordan's
Parliament, called on Arabs Wednesday ``to stand firmly against
American interests.''
   Commenting on reports that if threatened, Israel might use
Jordanian space to attack Iraq, he said, ``Jordan is not a passage
for anybody and if this happens we shall defend ourselves.''

   A Kuwaiti diplomat appealed to Arab countries
Wednesday to rally behind the United States-led effort to force
Iraqi invaders from his homeland.
   Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United
States, charged that his people are suffering ``brutal atrocities''
at the hands of Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait.
   Saud met with President Bush at the White House after Bush's
nationally televised address to explain why he had sent U.S.
troops, ships and warplanes to defend Saudi Arabia and the Persian
Gulf.
   The ambassador, a member of the deposed royal family, said he
conveyed to Bush ``a message from the Emir expressing our gratitude
and thanks to him, to the American people and to all those
countries that have rallied behind us in our day of need.''
   He said he told Bush of the reports of atrocities from refugees
who have fled Kuwait since last Thursday.
   ``I urged our friends around the world, with the leadership of
the United States ... and our brothers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
countries and also in the Arab world to rally and not to waste time
to put an end to these atrocities,'' Saud said.
   Asked if he had hoped for even more aggressive action from the
United States to liberate Kuwait, Saud said Bush was ``adamant''
about forcing the Iraqis to withdraw.
   ``The situation is in good hands, and we are reassured of
this,'' he said.
   Standing before a bank of cameras on the White House driveway,
he said, ``I would like from this forum to reassure my people in
Kuwait and my people around the world that ... Kuwait will be back
under the leadership of his highness the Emir.''
   ``Be patient. Keep collected and patient,'' he said.

complete'' Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, and later told reporters
U.S. forces would not try to drive the Iraqis out of that country.
The GIs are there primarily to defend Saudi Arabia, he said, and he
hoped the global U.N. trade embargo ordered Monday would pressure
Iraq President Saddam Hussein into a Kuwait pullout.

<HEAD>Vicki Long Claims She Was Seduced by Nun, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman whose romantic involvement with the
archbishop of Atlanta led to his resignation claims she was seduced
by a nun when she was 19, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Two anonymous sources say Vicki Long, 27, claims the seduction
occurred during a weekend trip to Pittsburgh, the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reported in a story Wednesday.
   Ms. Long has refused comment since her relationship with former
Archbishop Eugene Marino became public last week. Her attorney,
Anthony Fontana, did not return phone calls Wednesday.
   Atlanta Archdiocese officials confirmed last week that Marino,
who resigned his office citing health reasons, had an ``intimate
relationship'' with Ms. Long, a former lay minister. Marino has not
commented publicly.
   The Rev. Michael Woods, a Sandy Springs priest, resigned
Saturday, citing an intimate relationship with Ms. Long.
   Ms. Long has denied a sexual relationship with Woods, but an
archdiocese spokesman, the Rev. Peter Dora, said Woods ``did make
it clear ... that they had a sexual relationship.''
   Fontana has said Marino sexually manipulated Ms. Long, who is
considering filing a lawsuit against the archdiocese.
   The nun allegation first surfaced in Ms. Long's August 1987
paternity lawsuit against the Rev. Donal Keohane of Columbus, who
she claimed fathered her 4-year-old daughter. Blood tests showed
Keohane was not the father, but the archdiocese is paying her child
support.
   The lawsuit claimed Keohane developed a priest-counselor
relationship with Ms. Long and ``through this relationship learned
the details of (Ms. Long's) previous traumatic, demoralizing and
frightening experience.''
   That experience, the newspaper reported, was with a nun Ms. Long
worked with at St. Francis Hospital in Columbus. Pittsburgh is the
site of the home convent of the Franciscan Sisters of Millvale,
which furnishes nuns to St. Francis Hospital.
   The nun, who was transferred from Columbus, has not been
identified.

<HEAD>Winnie Mandela's Bodyguard Sentenced to Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former bodyguard of Winnie
Mandela was sentenced to death Wednesday in the killing of a
teen-age political activist, and officials said Mrs. Mandela's
alleged involvement in the case will be reviewed.
   The Supreme Court sentenced Jerry Richardson, 37, ex-bodyguard
and coach of the Mandela United soccer team, in the killing of
James ``Stompie'' Seipei Moeketsi, 14. There will be an automatic
review by an appeals court.
   The South African Press Association quoted Witwatersrand
Attorney-General Klaus van Lieres as saying he now will consider
the role in the case of Mrs. Mandela, wife of Nelson Mandela,
deputy president of the African National Congress.
   Mrs. Mandela has not been charged. Her driver and other
associates face trial next month on kidnapping and assault charges.
   The judge held during Richardson's trial that Mrs. Mandela was
at her home when Moeketsi was assaulted there. Moeketsi was killed
after being held at the house.
   Supreme Court Justice Brian O'Donovan rejected defense arguments
that a need by Richardson to gain Mrs. Mandela's favor, and a
desire to do whatever he thgought would please her, was a
mitigating factor in the killing.
   ``It is difficult to see how kidnap and murder can be mitigated
by the desire to please anybody,'' O'Donovan said.
   He also sentenced Richardson to 18 years imprisonment for
kidnapping, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and
attempted murder.
   Moeketsi was found stabbed to death in January 1989, after
Richardson took him from Mrs. Mandela's house in the black township
of Soweto. Richardson lived at the house with other young men who
called themselves the Mandela United Soccer Team and acted as Mrs.
Mandela's bodyguards.
   Last February, a group of South Africa's most prominent black
leaders said the soccer team engaged in a ``reign of terror'' in
Soweto. They urged the community to shun Mrs. Mandela.
   She began to reappear at anti-apartheid rallies, however, a few
months before her husband was freed from prison.
   According to trial testimony, Richardson and other associates of
Mrs. Mandela abducted the boy and three young men from a Methodist
Church-run home in Soweto in late December 1988. The three men
testified that Mrs. Mandela, Richardson and other bodyguards beat
and whipped them in a room at her house.
   Moeketsi was accused of being a police informer, according to
the testimony, and the three men were accused of having homosexual
relations with a Methodist minister who ran the church home.
   O'Donovan ruled that no evidence emerged to support the
allegation against the minister. Only Richardson was tried for the
murder.
   Referring to trial testimony, defense lawyer H. Joubert said
Mrs. Mandela had said Moeketsi and the three abducted men were
``not fit to be alive,'' and that she began the beatings.
   President F. W. de Klerk suspended hangings in February, but
courts may still impose the death sentence in murder cases when the
judge finds no mitigating factors.

<HEAD>Groups Go To Court To Protect Lab Rats, Mice and Birds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two animal welfare groups have sued the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to try to force officials to regulate
treatment of laboratory rats, mice and birds.
   In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, the Humane
Society of the United States and the Animal Legal Defense Fund
claim that the department misused its discretion in excluding rats,
mice and birds from the protection of the Animal Welfare Act.
   The two groups filed a petition with the department last year,
formally asking for regulations to cover rats, mice and birds. It
was denied in June on the grounds that Agriculture Secretary
CLayton Yeutter has legal responsibility to decide which animals
are covered, aside from those specified in the text of the law:
dogs, cats, monkeys, guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbits.
   Kelly Shipp, spokeswoman for Yeutter, said she was aware of the
groups' concerns but could not comment on the lawsuit because she
had not seen it.
   Martin L. Stephens, the Humane Society's director of laboratory
animals, said rats, mice and birds make up nearly 85 percent of all
animals used in research, testing and experimentation in the United
States.
   ``If these animals are needed in research, surely they deserve
minimum standards of care,'' Stephens said.

   A Swiss Red Cross worker who had been
held hostage in Lebanon for 10 months was freed Wednesday and
handed over to Swiss authorities, officials and witnesses said.
   It was the first release of a Western hostage in more than three
months.
   Reliable eyewitnesses said they saw Emanuel Christen being
handed to Swiss authorities shortly after midnight in front of the
Syrian Foreign Ministry. Syria had said the handover would not
occur until later Thursday.
   Christen, 33, was kidnapped Oct. 6 along with fellow Red Cross
worker Elio Erriquez, 24.
   A group calling itself the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads said
in a statement released Wednesday he had been freed. The Syrian
Foreign Ministry and Red Cross in Geneva confirmed the release.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Christen was handed to Swiss Charge d'Affaires Fritz Kuehni. They
said Kuehni and Christen were then driven to the Swiss Embassy. The
eyewitnesses said they were too far away to tell whether Christen
appeared to be in good health.
   The statement from the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads did not
explain why only one of the Swiss men was released. It had said in
a statement Tuesday night they both would be freed within 24 hours.
   That was the first time since the abductions a group had claimed
to hold Christen and Erriquez.
   ``After we have promised yesterday night to release the two
delegates of the International Red Cross in Lebanon within 24
hours, one of them, Emanuel Christen, has been set free and handed
over to a representative of Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan at 6 p.m. this
evening,'' said the text in full. It was handwritten in Arabic.
   The statement was delivered to the Beirut office of a Western
news agency at 11:30 p.m.
   Kenaan is the chief of Syrian Army intelligence in Lebanon.
   The statement was accompanied by an instant photograph of
Christen. It showed him from the waist up, wearing a dark T-shirt.
It was similar to the photograph that accompanied Tuesday's
statement, which was delivered to a Western news agency and the
independent An-Nahar newspaper.
   Christen and Erriquez were abducted outside an artificial limbs
center in Sidon, a port city 25 miles south of Beirut, where they
worked as orthopedic technicians.
   Police in Sidon had blamed their abduction on the
Libyan-financed Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction, led by
Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal. The group denied the
charge.
   The statement Tuesday said the decision to free the Red Cross
captives came in response to the wishes of Syrian President Hafez
Assad, Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and Algerian President
Chadli Bendjedid.
   The statement also said the group had guarantees that their
demands would be met, but did not specify what those demands were.
   There are now 15 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon. They
include six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, an Irishman
and an Italian, in addition to Erriquez.
   The longest held foreign hostage is Terry Anderson, 42, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   The two most recently freed hostages were Americans Frank
Herbert Reed, 57, and Robert Polhill, 55. Both were freed in April.

   It was one man's tribute to workers
with a dirty job.
   Todd Crittenden prepared and served breakfast Tuesday for four
employees of Clark Brothers Sanitation in the alley behind his
garage. A small hand-written sign said, ``The First Annual
Sanitation Engineers' Sunrise Breakfast.''
   The host said the meal was to still his guilt for a mound of
trash from a recent cleaning of his basement.
   ``This is about 10 years worth of accumulated junk, the
memorabilia of failed do-it-yourself projects,'' he said. ``I
thought the poor sanitation engineers are going to hate me for
this, so why don't I feed them breakfast?''
   Crittenden got up at 5 a.m. to prepare the TV tray settings. He
wore a tuxedo and served the workers sweet rolls with coffee,
orange juice and milk.
   Small wicker baskets held the rolls on each tray, next to jelly
jars with a cigarette in each. Crittenden was armed with a lighter
to do the bidding of any worker who cared to smoke.
   ``Each setting has an individual floral centerpiece in an
antique cream bottle,'' Crittenden pointed out.
   ``Surprising, very surprising,'' said Rick Homolka, one of the
workers.
   Ray Wooten has collected garbage on the same route for 10 years.
As he smoked the complimentary cigarette he said he has never been
served breakfast in an alley before.
   ``Well fellas, let's get to work,'' Wooten said after taking
about five minutes to enjoy the rolls and beverages. Wooten's
colleagues rose, thanked Crittenden and started loading the junk.

   Joseph T. Hill would have been better off
printing wallpaper than counterfeiting 3 million Polish zlotys,
federal agents say.
   That amount of Polish currency is worth $316.
   ``The guy could have printed a boxcar full of them and not have
enough to buy an expensive suit,'' said Rick Johnson of the U.S.
Secret Service office in Orlando.
   A U.S. District Court jury convicted Hill, 61, on Tuesday of
counterfeiting the bogus bills plus an unspecified amount of U.S.
currency. He faces 20 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.
   Hill, a former building contractor who traveled to Poland
earlier this year, testified he obtained a $19,000 laser copy
machine to duplicate greeting cards and make wallpaper.
   Secret Service agents investigated after police in nearby
Longwood arrested a man passing two counterfeit $20 bills. He led
authorities to Hill.
   ``We can only speculate that he was going to return to Poland
and live like a king,'' Johnson said.

   A man distraught over marital problems
set himself on fire and ran into his mother's house, which also
became engulfed in flames. He survived but his mother was killed.
   Evidence indicates Samuel Taylor, 30, doused himself with a
flammable liquid and set himself afire in ``a possible suicide
attempt,'' said homicide detective Belinda Weldon.
   ``He was despondent over his marital situation,'' she said.
   Police found what they called a suicide note in the charred
remains of the house. Details about the note and Taylor's marriage
were not disclosed.
   Police and witnesses said Taylor was aflame from head to toe
when he ran into his mother's house and screamed for help.
   ``I tried to stop it, but I couldn't put it out,'' said a
relative, George Davis. ``Fire was spreading everywhere.''
   He said Taylor ran out of the house after seeing flames race
across furniture and up curtains.
   Neighbors wrapped blankets around Taylor to put out his flames.
   Davis said he tried to save 51-year-old Clara Taylor, a stroke
victim, but the heat forced him and his wife outside.
   Taylor was in critical condition Wednesday in the burn unit of
University Hospital.

   Only buses and private cars have been allowed to cross the

   Turkey in effect closed an Iraqi oil pipeline, banned all
exports to Iraq except food and medicine, and stopped Iraqi imports
Tuesday in compliance with U.N. economic sanctions.

   The Soviet Union kept conspicuously silent
Wednesday about the U.S. military buildup in the Middle East in
what appeared to be a tacit endorsement of the moves against Iraq,
Moscow's former ally.
   Moscow, along with Washington, has strongly condemned the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. On Wednesday, the Kremlin did not go so far as
to offer immediate ships, troops or moral support for President
Bush's announcement of a multinational force to deter any Iraqi
attack on Saudi Arabia.
   But the Soviet silence came in stark contrast to the past, when
Moscow routinely denounced U.S. military operations in Libya,
Panama, Grenada and Lebanon.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry held no briefings Wednesday, and no
commentaries on the U.S. moves appeared immediately in the
state-run press. Factual accounts of Bush's speech announcing the
deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia appeared on Soviet
television and in the official news agency Tass.
   The only hint of Soviet reaction was anchorman Igor Fesunenko's
remark on the television news program Vremya about ``the most
alarming news'' from the Middle East. Introducing a report on
Iraq's announcement it had annexed Kuwait, Fesunenko said, ``I
wouldn't take it upon myself to predict the consequences of this
event.''
   During the crisis, the Soviets have acted in unprecedented
cooperation with the United States, despite their previous alliance
with Iraq. They issued a joint statement with Washington calling
for the Iraqis to withdraw, and they backed the U.S. plan approved
by the United Nations for a worldwide embargo on Iraqi oil and
other goods. They also cut off all military supplies to Iraq.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said Tuesday the
Soviets were adopting a ``wait and see'' attitude toward the U.S.
naval presence in the region.

   East German lawmakers, pressed by a sinking
economy, voted on Wednesday to merge with West Germany in less than
10 weeks.
   The vote set the stage for a political showdown in West
Germany's Parliament over the date of unification.
   Under the East German proposal approved Wednesday, the first
united German elections in almost 60 years would be held Oct. 14.
Formal unity would take place either immediately before or after
the balloting.
   The West German Parliament would have to approve constitutional
changes needed to allow elections to take place that quickly.
   Opposition Social Democrats in West Germany have sworn to block
those changes, which require a two-thirds majority in the lower
house of Parliament, the Bundestag.
   The left-of-center Social Democrats believe early unification
but a later election date would hurt conservative West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, because he would be blamed for East
Germany's deteriorating economy.
   Kohl's Christian Democrats, also the party of East German Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere, want unification and united German
elections on Oct. 14.
   The Social Democrats, the second-largest parties in both
nations, want unification alone on Sept. 15 and elections for a
united government on Dec. 2.
   Kohl needs the approval of the Social Democrats to shorten the
constitutional timetable for holding elections.
   East German lawmakers on Wednesday voted 187-148 in favor of the
Oct. 14 proposal for both joint elections and unification. There
were 11 abstentions.
   Oct. 14 is also the date East Germany will hold elections for
the state governments it will create to match West Germany's
federal system.
   Wednesday's vote was a victory for de Maiziere, but he has
nearly destroyed his governing coalition over the issue. The Social
Democrats in his coalition voted against the proposal.
   ``Unity must be completed quickly and well,'' de Maiziere said
in urging approval of his party's proposal.
   He said that splitting unity and elections would force East
Germany, plagued by rising joblessness, to endure too long a
political campaign.
   Kohl is believed to want elections as fast as possible. The
prolonged dispute over unification has led to political
bloodletting that could hurt him.
   Earlier Wednesday, East German lawmakers voted overwhelmingly
for a proposal that the merger take place only after major
international and domestic questions on unity are resolved.
   That vote blocked an attempt by a small conservative party to
seek an instant merger so West Germany could assume immediate
responsibility for East Germany's faltering economy.
   Under the adopted resolution:
   _A political treaty on merging the German states must first be
concluded, expected before September.
   _The final round of unification talks must be concluded between
the four World War II allies _ the Soviet Union, the United States,
Britain and France. The last session is set for Sept. 12 in Moscow.
   _Progress must be made on building the five states to which East
Germany will be reduced when it merges with West Germany.
   Some lawmakers expressed embarrassment over the increasingly
harsh debate that lawmaker Christian Schultze characterized as an
``unrestrained pre-election campaign.''
   ``We politicians have not cut a good figure in the quarrel over
this question,'' said Richard Schroeder, parliamentary leader of
the East German Social Democrats.
   The West German Bundestag meets Thursday.
   All the parties say they are motivated by East Germany's rising
jobless rate and worsening economic situation since the July 1
economic merger of the two nations.

   Thunderstorms spread rain across parts of the East on Wednesday,
and a third day of record low temperatures cooled the central part
of the nation.
   Strong thunderstorms developed in the Southeast in the hot,
moist air ahead of a slowly moving cold front. Thunderstorms
produced winds gusting to 55 mph in Atlanta, and hail as large as
golf balls in Marion County, Fla.
   The same cold front produced showers and thunderstorms along
much of the Atlantic Coast.
   Elsewhere, a few showers and thunderstorms fell over coastal
Texas and the southern Appalachians. There were a few showers over
parts of Upper Michigan.
   Hot weather continued in the West, with temperatures approaching
90 degrees in Washington state by midday, and nearing 100 in the
desert Southwest. Fresno, Calif., hit 111 and the temperature
reached 120 at Death Valley, Calif.
   It was unseasonably cool across the south-central part of the
nation Wednesday morning. Sixteen cities reported record low
temperatures for the date.
   Those records were: Alamosa, Colo., 37; Austin, Texas, 69; Baton
Rouge, La., 64; Birmingham, Ala., 60; Camden, Ark. 57; El Dorado,
Ark., 56; Hot Springs, Ark., 50; Houston, 68; Kansas City, Mo., 57;
Lake Charles, La., 64; Lubbock, Texas, 58; Meridian, Miss., 58;
Pine Bluff, Ark., 57; Port Arthur, Texas, 69; South Bend, Ind., 50;
Texarkana, Ark., 58; Waco, Texas, 61.
   North of that region, afternoon temperatures were in the upper
80s in the northern High Plains and in the lower 90s in western
South Dakota and western Nebraska.
   Wednesday's low in the Lower 48 states was 34 degrees in
Gunnison, Colo.

   Rebel leader Prince Johnson on
Wednesday freed foreign hostages, and Liberia's West African
neighbors prepared to send in peacekeeping troops to try to bring a
halt to the bloodshed.
   Savage street battles raged in the Liberian capital of Monrovia,
where rebel armies loyal to Johnson and his rival, Charles Taylor,
were fighting each other and soldiers of the beleaguered President
Samuel K. Doe.
   Johnson seized the hostages Monday and Tuesday in a bid to
provoke foreign intervention in Liberia's bloody 7-month-old civil
war. Earlier in the week, the rebel leader presented 22 hostages
from eight countries to reporters at a news conference.
   The British Foreign Office said Johnson released all the
remaining hostages Wednesday, but said it had no total number.
However, one official in London said four Britons were among those
freed.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the freed foreigners were back at a hotel. He said they include one
American whom he identified only as Chris Mendez. He said the
fighting prevented U.S. officials from contacting Mendez.
   The other hostages included an Argentinian, a Dutchman, two West
Germans and 10 Lebanese.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday
that 2,000 West African troops were being sent to Monrovia by sea
from Freetown, the capital of neighboring Sierra Leone.
   They said most of the troops would come from Nigeria, the most
powerful West African nation. Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida
said Wednesday the troops would try to impose a truce, and he hoped
they would meet no resistance.
   He did not say when the force was being dispatched but said it
would be ``very soon.''
   In the past, Babangida has been a strong ally of Doe. Taylor
claimed earlier this week that the force was being sent to keep Doe
and his corrupt administration in power. He had threatened to
attack such an army.
   Military sources in Freetown said troops of the force were on
standby at the Sierra Leonean coastal village of Sulina, 10 miles
from the Liberian border.
   Reports from the Nigerian capital, Lagos, said troops also might
be airlifted into Monrovia.
   The five-nation African force was to be led by Lt. Gen. Arnold
Quainoo of Ghana, a Cabinet minister who used to command the army,
according to Ghana's government.
   Other nations sending soldiers are Guinea, Sierra Leone and Togo.
   Babangida, arriving in Lagos from a two-day emergency summit of
the West African Economic Community in Gambia, suggested the West
African leaders hoped for some form of U.S. intervention.
   ``I believe the United States shares our desire to bring peace
to Liberia and halt the daily carnage there, especially around
Monrovia, urgently and we are hoping that this operation will get
the support of America,'' he said.
   The 16-nation West African Community, of which Liberia is a
member, has asked the international community to help pay costs of
the peacekeepers and proposed general and presidential elections,
estimated at $50 million.
   Leaders at the summit of the Economic Community of West African
States said the troops were being deployed ``in the interest of the
African people as a whole and for the maintenance of international
peace and security.''
   The announcement said the troops would impose a cease-fire that
would allow for the establishment of a broad-based interim
government charged with organizing free and fair elections.
   It said none of the warring parties would be permitted to
participate in the interim government, and no members of the
interim government would be allowed to stand for election.
   Doe welcomed the West African initiative, and Taylor's envoys
told the Gambia meeting they might accept such a force.
   France appealed Wednesday for its citizens in the Liberian
capital to make their presence known to the U.S. or French
embassies in case they needed to be evacuated. A Foreign Ministry
spokesman in Paris said there are about 20 French nationals in
Liberia.
   Other nations trying to evacuate their nationals include
Nigeria, Ghana and India.
   The U.S. State Department said a skeletal staff would remain at
its embassy in Monrovia. The U.S. government also has agreed to
evacuate some other foreign nationals who can reach the embassy
compound.
   Some of the 235 Marines who were airlifted into Monrovia to
pluck out Americans and other foreign nationals have taken up
defensive positions within the walled U.S. Embassy compound. About
2,100 Marines were sent in ships off Liberia.
   State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said the Marines
will protect the U.S. Embassy ``with force if necessary.''
   Boucher said evacuation flights were continuing and that eight
more people, including four Americans, were flown out of the
country Wednesday. In all, 125 people have been evacuated in the
U.S. operation, including 91 Americans, he said.

<HEAD>NASA Arms Magellan Rocket As Spacecraft Speeds Toward Venus Orbit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA armed Magellan's rocket Wednesday,
preparing the spacecraft to orbit Venus for a $744 million mission
to take the best radar pictures yet of the surface of the
cloud-covered planet.
   The agency has recently been embarrassed by a mirror defect that
crippled the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope and hydrogen leaks
that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet.
   So engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory are intent on making
sure the unmanned Magellan successfully fires its rocket Friday to
go into near-polar orbit around Venus.
   If all goes well, engineers will spend most of the month testing
Magellan's radar and making adjustments. Sometime between Aug. 26
and Sept. 1, Magellan will start formal use of its radar to peer
through thick Venusian clouds and map the planet.
   ``I'm able to sleep as long as I don't drink caffeine, but I
suspect I'm going to be very nervous'' until Magellan is safely in
orbit, said Magellan project manager Tony Spear. ``It's like your
life can go either one direction or another, so I don't plan after
Friday right now.''
   The 3.7-ton Magellan was released from the cargo bay of the
shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, then fired an inertial upper-stage
booster rocket to launch it on a looping, 948-million-mile trip to
the second planet from the sun.
   Engineers received a radio signal from Magellan on Wednesday
indicating the spacecraft successfully completed an electronic
circuit to arm a solid-fuel Star rocket, Spear said.
   At 9:32 a.m. PDT Friday, a computer program will automatically
order the rocket to fire for 83 seconds. The rocket, firing
forward, will reduce Magellan's speed from 24,600 mph to about
18,600 mph. That will allow Magellan to be captured by Venus'
gravity into an orbit ranging from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles
above the planet.
   The spacecraft will be behind Venus when the rocket ignites, and
won't emerge from Venus' shadow until about 9:54 a.m. Radio signals
from Magellan take almost 13 minutes to reach Earth. So it will be
about 10:07 a.m. PDT when engineers receive a radio signal
indicating Magellan is in orbit.
   If they receive the signal five minutes early, that will mean
the rocket didn't fire and Magellan is speeding past Venus in
another major failure for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   But Spear is optimistic the mission will work.
   ``We trust our spacecraft,' he said. ``It's demonstrated it
knows how to take instructions.''
   At midmorning Wednesday, Magellan was 519,095 miles from Venus
and 143 million miles from Earth. It was traveling at 10,189 mph,
increasing speed as it was tugged by Venusian gravity.
   Magellan will be able to detect Venusian surface features larger
than the length of about 2{ football fields. So its pictures will
be about 10 times more detailed than the best pictures obtained by
radars on Earth or aboard some of the two dozen spacecraft that
have visited the planet before.
   Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor other than the moon, and the
two planets are similar in size and density. Magellan may reveal
whether the two planets also have similar geological processes,
including movements of gargantuan plates of shifting crustal rock.
   It also may detect evidence of ``Venusquakes,'' determine if any
of the planet's tens of thousands of volcanoes are erupting, and
learn if Venus had oceans before a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
raised its surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Magellan's prime mission is to map 70 percent to 90 percent of
the planet during the first 243-day cycle, equal to one Venus day.
NASA is expected to approve continued operation. Three 243-day
mapping cycles are needed to map the entire planet.
   NASA's comptroller's office says the total cost of the Magellan
mission is $744 million, including $413 million for the spacecraft
and its instruments.

<TEXT>
   Israelis are becoming increasingly jittery
about Iraq's military expansion, worrying that Saddam Hussein will
try to make good on threats to use chemical weapons against the
Jewish state.
   Some Israelis are stockpiling canned goods in their attics,
since the Persian Gulf conflict has triggered memories of being
under siege by Arab armies. Others are trying to purchase gas masks.
   Most are glued to their radios and eager to see their superpower
ally, the United States, put an end to the invasion.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens warned Wednesday that an Iraqi
attack on Israel ``is not impossible.''
   ``We have heard his (Saddam's) threats and we know he carries
out his threats, as he did with Kuwait,'' Arens said. ``But I'm
sure he knows that Israel is not Kuwait and not Saudi Arabia,
therefore I think that the chance he will do such a thing is not
very high.''
   Arens said Israel has not been asked to help in the U.S.-led
multinational force to deter Iraqi aggression. But he said Israel
would respond positively if the United States asked to use its
landing facilities.
   Arens, of the right-wing Likud bloc, has repeatedly warned that
Israel will take action if Saddam sends forces into neighboring
Jordan. He has called Saddam a ``little Hitler.''
   Even dovish legislators have thrown their support behind Arens.
   ``Iraq's action has surprised many and people talk about it all
the time,'' said Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, a psychologist at Haifa
University. ``It is clear this has made many fear there could be a
war. He's got missiles and planes. Everyone would love to see this
whole crisis come to an end.''
   Iraq, which boasts a 1-million-strong army, is Israel's most
formidable Arab foe. It has a powerful air force and weapons
arsenal that includes non-conventional arms.
   On Wednesday, Iraq's military command claimed Israeli warplanes
had been painted in American colors and readied for an attack on
Iraq. The Iraqi command warned that Iraq would respond to ``any
aggressive act by Israel ... wherever Iraq's long arm may reach to
strike its targets.''
   Four months ago, Saddam said he would torch half of Israel with
binary chemical weapons if Israel attacked his country.
   Israeli officials denied the Iraqi allegations.
   ``This is another lie that the President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
is using to advance his aggressive aims,'' the Israeli military
command said in a statement.
   An army spokesman refused to say whether the army has been put
on alert following the Iraqi announcement.
   Most Israeli observers agreed that the Iraqi announcement was
aimed at winning sympathy in the Arab world while deterring the
United States from attacking Iraq.
   Adding to Israel's concern is the alliance Saddam has forged
with King Hussein of Jordan, the Arab country with the longest
common border with Israel. Israeli reports say Hussein recently
allowed Iraqi warplanes to fly menacingly close to Israel's
frontier.
   The invasion of Kuwait last Thursday made Iraq's threat loom
larger, compounding the Israelis' preoccupation with security that
is fueled daily by the Palestinian uprising.
   Israeli generals held an emergency meeting last weekend and
decided to step up the distribution of gas masks nationwide,
Israeli media reported.
   But some Israelis are too anxious to wait for army-issued
equipment. Miriam Sterman, a Jerusalem homemaker and mother of
four, told a reporter she would try to buy her own masks.
   Ms. Sterman reacted to reports that Iraq was loading chemical
weapons onto warplanes in response to a U.S. military buildup in
Saudi Arabia.
   Hannah Ilan, another Jerusalem resident, has asked her husband
to buy cartons of flour, sugar, canned milk, and a sesame paste
called tehina, which is a popular Middle East food.
   Mrs. Ilan explained that she survived two sieges of Jerusalem.
One was in the 1948 Middle East war when Palestinian fighters
choked all supplies to the city for weeks. The other was in 1967,
when she spent most of the weeklong war in a shelter with three
children, including an infant.
   ``Those memories haunt me. I hear there's a war going on around
here so all I worry about is having enough in the house,'' Mrs.
Ilan said.
   Many feel consoled that the military action is happening far
from Israel's borders. Kuwait is 800 miles away.
   Analysts also note that Israel's military strength would likely
deter Saddam from attacking the Jewish state.
   But there is also some disappointment at seeing the United
States unable to put a swift end to the crisis, said Mark Heller,
an expert on Iraq at Tel Aviv University.
   ``There is this hope, expectation that the U.S. will give them
(the Iraqis) a slap in the face,'' he said.

   President Bush said Wednesday he dispatched
American troops on a dangerous mission to the Persian Gulf to
protect Saudi Arabian oilfields and ward off a threat to America's
``economic independence.'' He warned Iraq's Saddam Hussein: ``A
line has been drawn in the sand.''
   Bush said, ``We're not in a war.'' And he called the U.S. effort
``wholly defensive.'' He offered no guess as to when the operation
might end.
   He demanded Iraq's ``immediate, complete and unconditional''
withdrawal from Kuwait, the little oil state Saddam's armies
overran last week.
   Laying out reasons for the largest deployment outside this
hemisphere since the Vietnam war, Bush said America imports half
its oil from abroad and ``could face a major threat to its economic
independence'' if Saddam, ``an aggressive dictator,'' manages to
take over the oilfields of the Persian Gulf.
   The president reached out to unlikely international partners in
his bid to squeeze Iraq. Secretary of State James Baker told
reporters the Soviet Union had dispatched naval forces to the
Persian Gulf for use in any international blockade to enforce a UN
trade embargo.
   Baker also said he was dispatching an aide to Syria ``to see if
we can coordinate'' and added the United States has been in touch
with Iran ``through third party contacts.'' Both nations are bitter
foes of Iraq _ but Syria is on the official State Department list
of states supporting terrorism, and Iran has long been accused of
pulling the strings behind the holders of American hostages in
Beirut.
   The president's decision won quick support from members of
Congress, but some worried whether other countries would join in
the stop-Iraq action. ``I hope we will not be the `Lone Ranger'
like we were in Vietnam,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   Bush's appeals to other nations to commit their armies to a
multinational defense of the Saudis met a tepid public response.
Only Britain joined in wholeheartedly.
   However, congressional sources who asked not to be identified
said several hundred soldiers from other Persian Gulf countries,
already in Saudi Arabia under the auspices of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, had been moved into position to cooperate with U.S. and
Saudi forces.
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said following a briefing by Defense
Department officials ``it appears this is a very strong
multi-national effort.'' But he declined to be more specific about
the origins of the force.
   As a tense president spoke to the nation, government sources
said at least 5,000 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne and other
units were en route or already taking positions on Saudi soil _
backed by an armada of air and seapower, armed to the hilt.
   By evening, one Pentagon source said the military movement was
expected to last ``several days, at least.'' The source said the
troop movements had encountered no difficulties.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, peeled away some of the secrecy from the
operation _ while keeping quiet about the size of the U.S.
commitment.
   Powell told reporters ground forces had ``taken up position'' on
Saudi soil. And he said the aircraft carrier USS Independence and
its support ships were stationed just outside the Persian Gulf, in
position to choke off Iraqi trade lines.
   The U.S. contingent included 140 jet fighters and bombers as
well as battleships that carried 32 Tomahawk Cruise missiles
programmed to destroy specific targets in Iraq, military sources
said.
   ``You can be sure that for the mission we have been given we
will put in adequate forces,'' Powell said. The battle-tested
Iraqis, he said, ``are not invincible. They are not ten feet tall.''
   Diplomatic sources in the Mideast reported that hundreds of U.S.
Marines were airlifted early Wednesday to near Khafji, an
oil-terminal Saudi town near the Kuwaiti border. Khafji is the site
of the Japanese-owned Arabian Oil Co. There was no immediate
confirmation in Washington.
   Bush seemed tense when he went on television at 9 a.m. EDT for a
10-minute speech, but he appeared more relaxed _ although tired _
three hours later at a news conference. He stumbled over his words
occasionally.
   ``No one commits America's armed forces to a dangerous mission
lightly,'' he said. The American forces ``will not initiate
hostilities but they will defend themselves,'' he said.
   Instead of trying to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait by military
action, Bush expressed hope that a U.N.-directed worldwide trade
embargo of Iraqi oil could force Saddam into submission. He hinted
that a blockade of Iraqi ports _ usually considered an act of war _
might be forthcoming if the embargo proves ineffective.
   ``The stakes are high,'' the president said. ``Iraq is already a
rich and powerful country that possesses the world's second largest
reserves of oil and over a million men under arms. It's the fourth
largest military in the world.''
   Baker, who flew to Turkey, said he was carrying assurances of
financial and military support for its ``forthright closing of an
Iraqi oil pipeline and for freezing Iraqi assets.'' Earlier,
government sources said the Turks were seeking $2 billion to
compensate them for revenue lost by cutting off Iraq's oil exports.

   Denouncing three teen-age defendants as rapists
and would-be killers, the prosecutor in the Central Park jogger
case summed up the case Wednesday by asking jurors to imagine the
victim's terror.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, stressing charges
of rape and attempted murder, repeatedly referred to the woman who
was gang-raped and bashed repeatedly with a brick the night of
April 19, 1989, while out for her nightly run.
   ``After they finished beating and raping her, they left her
bleeding and unconscious in the most desolate part of the park,''
Lederer said. ``They weren't satisfied with raping her. They
demonstrated an intent to kill her.''
   She asked the jury to convict Yusef Salaam, 16; Raymond Santana,
15; and Antron McCray, 16, in the attack on the jogger and attacks
on two male joggers during a gang rampage through Central Park. The
three are charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, riot,
assault and robbery.
   After Lederer's final argument, Justice Thomas Galligan began
his charge to the jury. Deliberations were to begin Thursday.
   Earlier, about 10 minutes into Lederer's summation, about a
dozen relatives and supporters of the defendants walked out of the
courtroom together.
   Lederer continued speaking, and the jury showed no reaction as
the group exited. The supporters then stood humming a spiritual and
praying in a circle outside the courtroom.
   Galligan subsequently banned them from the courtroom.
   Lederer asked jurors to ``imagine what went through the mind of
(the jogger) as the attackers surrounded her and started ripping
off her clothes.
   ``These defendants wanted her to die, and they took the steps to
make that happen,'' the prosecutor said. ``These defendants had
every reason for not wanting her to survive.''
   Lederer challenged each defendant's claim that his statement was
improperly taken and that police lied about interrogation
procedures.
   Referring to Yusef Salaam's contention that he was tricked into
confessing the crime, Lederer noted his confidence when he
testified.
   ``This is not a person who is manipulated. This not a person who
has words put in his mouth,'' Lederer said.
   Lederer disputed a defense argument that a lack of blood on the
teen-agers' clothing indicated they had nothing to do with the
attack. The jogger lost at least three-fourths of her blood in the
assault.
   Lederer said the jogger was found a short distance from where
her assailants left her to die.
   ``The defendants dragged her into the cover of darkness,'' about
78 feet into the woods off a paved drive, where they beat and raped
her, Lederer said.
   Still thrashing because of neurological reflex, ``She lost that
blood while rolling down to the path.
   ``There was no reason their clothes should be bloody,'' Lederer
said. ``She was bleeding from her head. These defendants didn't
come into contact with her head. ... They were raping her.''
   Defense lawyers made their final appeals to the jury on Tuesday,
with one attorney suggesting the victim was not gang-raped, while
another accused detectives of lying about how incriminating
statements were obtained from the three defendants. Those
statements are the prosecution's chief evidence.
   Salaam's attorney, Robert Burns, said unanswered questions about
the woman's sex life raised doubts about whether she was raped at
all.
   The 30-year-old jogger is back at work as a vice president at
the Salomon Brothers investment banking firm. She testified that
she still suffers from impaired sight, balance and smell as a
result of the attack.

   Czechoslovakia's ambassador to Washington,
hospitalized with acute leukemia 20 days ago, is much improved, her
embassy said Wednesday.
   Ambassador Rita Klimova ``is recovering and the doctors are very
optimistic,'' said Czechoslovak Embassy press officer Daniel
Veseley.
   ``The chemotherapy is working, it is the best news we could
have,'' he said a reporter. ``She is feeling quite well and
optimistic for recovery,'' he added.
   Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where Klimova was taken
Aug. 20 for examinations and chemotherapy treatment, has referred
queries on her condition to the embassy. Leukemia is cancer of the
white blood cells treated by pharmaceuticals or bone marrow
transplant or a combination of the two.
   The disease was first diagnosed at Walter Reed U.S. Army Medical
Center in Washington, where President George Bush's personal
physician arranged for her to be examined, Embassy Charge
d'Affaires, or acting ambassador, Miroslav Chrobok said last month.
   Doctors at Walter Reed were quoted by Chrobok as saying
radioactive fallout from the 1986 Soviet nuclear accident at
Chernobyl could be the cause of Klimova's leukemia.

<HEAD>Mexico To Boost Oil Exports To the United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Mexico said Wednesday it plans to increase oil
exports to the United States by 100,000 barrels a day for two
months to help compensate for the the loss of U.S. imports from
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Mexican Foreign Secretary Fernando Solana said the gesture was
being made in the interests of benefiting ``an important and
friendly client.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the action ``exemplifies
the spirit of relations between the two countries.''
   Solana and Brady spoke to reporters at the conclusion of
day-long discussions between Mexican and American officials held
under the auspices of the U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission.
   After the Iraqi military takeover of Kuwait, President Bush
imposed an embargo on imported oil from both countries. According
to U.S. government figures, the United States imported about
600,000 barrels a day from Iraq and about 117,000 from Kuwait.
   Total daily U.S. imports average an estimated 8 million barrels
a day. Solana indicated that the Mexican increase would have been
higher but that oil production in Mexico is running virtually at
capacity.
   Last year, Mexico exported 763,000 barrels a day to the United
States out of total production of more than 2.5 million barrels.
About half Mexico's production is exported.
   ``This aid by Mexico is much appreciated at this time,'' Brady
said.
   While the U.S. stands to benefit from increased supplies,
Mexico, in turn, will receive increased revenues from the expanded
oil exports, as well as a bonus from the higher prices that have
resulted from the international embargo of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil.
   At the ceremonial opening of Wednesday's discussions, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III joined forces with Solana in condemning
the Iraqi conquest of Kuwait and they demanded an immediate
withdrawal of Iraqi forces.
   Baker said completion of a free trade agreement and continued
progress in the war against narcotics trafficking are two of the
major challenges the United States and Mexico face.
   Trade officials from both countries recommended to President
Bush that the two countries open negotiations on a free-trade
agreement. Bush was pleased by the recommendation, said spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fiztwater said in a statement such an agreement ``could create a
more prosperous trade and investment relationship'' between the two
countries.
   The United States and Canada negotiated a similar agreement in
1988, removing almost all trade barriers between the two countries.
   Baker said cooperation in combatting the drug trade has been
better this year than at any time in history.
   For his part, Solana said, ``Mexico is willing to multiply its
economic contacts with the United States. We believe that a fair,
free trade agreement would be a major step in that direction.''
   Solana touched only briefly on the drug issue in his remarks.
According to U.S. officials, the priority Mexico has given to this
issue is reflected in increased cocaine seizures, an estimated
26,500 pounds over the last six months, most as a result of joint
Mexican-American operations.
   In addition, Mexico is pleased that the United States is
increasingly accepting Mexico's view that the U.S. government
should do more to reduce demand for narcotics.
   More than 150 representatives from the two countries attended
this year's meeting of the Binational Commission. The size of the
delegations reflects the broad array of cross border issues on the
bilateral agenda.

   The United States turned to two of its
long-time Middle East adversaries, Syria and Iran, seeking
potential partners to counter Iraq's aggression in the Persian Gulf.
   The dramatic moves were announced by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III as he flew to Turkey with assurances to that nation of
financial and military support for its ``forthright closing'' of
two Iraqi oil pipelines and for freezing Iraqi assets.
   U.S. government sources said Turkey was seeking $2 billion to
compensate it for revenue it will lose by closing the pipelines.
   Before stopping at a Portugese air base in the Azores for
refueling, Baker also said he had received new assurances of Soviet
support in enforcing an economic boycott of Iraq ordered by the
United Nations Security Council.
   Baker told reporters traveling with him he would send John H.
Kelly, assistant secretary of state for the Near East, to Damascus
from Ankara ``to see if we can coordinate with the Syrians'' on
collective efforts against Iraq.
   At the same time, Baker verified reports that the United States
also has been in touch with Iran through ``third party contacts.''
   The enmity between the Syrian and Iraqi governments is intense,
with the only possible greater enmity being that between Iran and
Iraq. Syria helped Iran in Iran's long and bloody eight-year war
started by another invasion of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in
1980.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad and Saddam Hussein are longtime
rivals within the Arab world. The two nations are ruled by rival
Arab socialist parties, each considering the other an outcast.
   Apart from that conflict, Syria's relationship with the United
States has been as bad as U.S. reations with Iraq. In fact, Syria
is one of six countries listed by the State Department as
sponsoring terrorists acts. Iraq was removed from that list several
years ago.
   Terrorist groups believed to be under the influence of Iran are
holding six Americans hostage in Lebanon, the longest since 1985.
   Baker declined to say what `` collective efforts'' Syria and the
United States might undertake against Iraq.
   ``I really don't want to get into the specifics of that,'' he
said.
   Baker talked for about a half hour by telephone with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, their third conversation
in two days. The secretary then said, ``They continue to support
enforcement of the U.N. resolution. We can look toward continued
Soviet cooperation to carry out the resolution.''
   Baker said Moscow had dispatched naval forces to the Persian
Gulf for use in any international blockade to enforce the sanctions
approved unanimously Monday by the U.N. Security Council.
   Kelly, who was flying to Turkey with Baker, will go on to Saudi
Arabia, whose oil fields the U.S is protecting with thousands of
troops dispatched Wednesday. Kelly will meet with ousted leaders of
the Kuwaiti government who were given sanctuary in Saudi Arabia,
and with Saudi officials.
   A senior U.S. official who demanded anonymity said was up to
Saudi Arabia to decide whether Syria and Iran could participate in
defense of the kingdon against Iraq. Iran has mounted terrorist
operations against Saudi Arabia in the past, according to Saudi
officials.

   By sea and air, American paratroopers, seamen and fighter pilots
plunged into the gathering storm of the Middle East on Wednesday to
defend the Saudi oil kingdom against any attack by a powerful,
expansionist Iraq.
   Just six days after invading Kuwait, the Iraqis proclaimed they
had annexed that wealthy Persian Gulf nation, and Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein sounded unafraid of the U.S. superpower.
   ``All the fleets and squadrons of aircraft ... will not shake a
single palm frond'' in Iraq, said a statement by Saddam's ruling
council.
   In Washington, President Bush warned the Iraqis that ``a line
has been drawn in the sand'' in Saudi Arabia, where the first
aircraft and ground forces of a U.S. expeditionary force took up
positions Wednesday.
   The United States also turned to two of its longtime Middle East
adversaries, Syria and Iran, seeking partners to counter Iraq's
aggression.
   Egypt announced that an emergency Arab summit would convene in
Cairo Thursday to discuss the crisis.
   The potential for further explosions in the Arabian desert sent
new tremors through the Middle East and around the world.
   Hundreds of Americans and other foreigners streamed to airports
in Saudi Arabia to get out of the country. American officials again
expressed concern about more than 3,000 U.S. citizens stranded _
and possibly detained _ in Iraq and Kuwait. Dozens of oil tankers,
their masters fearful of conflict, stood anchored outside the
Persian Gulf.
   As GIs packed up for the 5,000-mile journey to the Persian Gulf
and the uncertain days ahead, Americans wondered whether they were
headed into war.
   Angela Nelson was to wed an 82nd Airborne Division soldier on
Saturday in Michigan, but he was recalled for duty in Saudi Arabia.
``It's scary,'' she said. ``Not just for my wedding, but for the
country.''
   Saddam said his 100,000-man invasion force seized Kuwait last
week because the emirate had wronged Iraq _ by overproducing oil,
driving down world prices and Iraqi revenues, and by demanding
repayment of huge loans it made to Iraq. He also reasserted
longstanding Iraqi territorial claims on Kuwait.
   In announcing the abrupt annexation Wednesday, the Iraqis
claimed that ``history has proved that Kuwait is a part of Iraq.''
   But Bush, in a White House address televised to the nation,
declared that history had instead proven that ``we must resist
aggression or it will destroy us.''
   Saddam disclaims any design on vast Saudi Arabia, which borders
both Kuwait and Iraq. Refugees filtering out of Kuwait say the
dug-in Iraqi troops are in seemingly defensive positions.
   American officials said, however, they considered the Iraqi army
an ``imminent threat'' to Saudi Arabia, and said intelligence
reports indicate the the Iraqis are in offensive formations.
   The United States rushed to Saudi Arabia's side, Bush said,
because the American economy, heavily dependent on imported oil,
would be threatened if Saddam, ``an aggressive dictator,'' took
over Gulf oilfields.
   Bush, who demanded an ``immediate, unconditional and complete''
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, later told reporters U.S. forces
would not try to drive the Iraqis out of that country. The GIs are
there primarily to defend Saudi Arabia, he said, and he hoped the
global U.N. trade embargo ordered Monday would pressure Saddam into
a Kuwait pullout.
   American officials provided few public details of the strength
and timetable of the U.S. military deployment in Saudi Arabia.
   At least 5,000 ground troops were involved, U.S. sources said,
along with 140 F-15s, F-16s and other jet fighters and bombers.
   Besides the 82nd Airborne, Pentagon sources said Bush ordered
elements of the 101st Airborne Division and the 24th Infantry
Division (mechanized) to duty in Saudi Arabia. The 101st is
equipped with attack helicopters that could be launched against
advancing tanks.
   In addition, 4,000 U.S. Marines were flown to Saudi Arabia and
some units were deployed near the oil-terminal town of Khafji,
which abuts the border of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, Mideast diplomatic
sources said. And five U.S. Air Force AWACs reconnaissance planes
were arriving Wednesday in Saudi Arabia, said Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The Bush administration called the intervention a
``multinational'' effort, but few other governments climbed aboard
immediately. Egypt and Morocco denied reports by U.S. sources that
they had agreed to send troops to Saudi Arabia. Only the British
said they would send unspecified military forces.
   But Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak said Egyptians might later
take part in an all-Arab force. Meanwhile, the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council, an alliance of Arab emirates, condemned the
Iraqi aggression, raising the possibility that the smaller oil
states might join the U.S.-led force. A brigade of troops from the
emirates was already in Saudi Arabia.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, flying to Turkey with
assurances of financial and military support for Ankara's closing
of two Iraqi oil pipelines, told reporters he would send John H.
Kelly, assistant secretary of state for the Near East, to Damascus
``to see if we can coordinate with the Syrians'' on collective
efforts against Iraq.
   At the same time, Baker verified reports that the United States
also has been in touch with Iran through ``third party contacts.''
   The enmity between the Syrian and Iraqi governments is intense,
with the only possible greater enmity being that between Iran and
Iraq.
   Not all Arabs condemn Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. In
Iraqi-aligned Jordan, for example, the Moslem Brotherhood Movement,
the strongest bloc in the Parliament, called on Arabs ``to stand
firmly against American interests.''
   Gen. Powell said in Washington that the Iraqis, hardened by a
recent eight-year war with Iran, ``are not invincible. They are not
10 feet tall.''
   But the several thousand U.S. troops reported being deployed in
the 100-degree heat and blowing sands of Saudi Arabia would be no
match for the large Iraqi invasion units in Kuwait, or the
million-man Iraqi army that backs them up.
   The best immediate U.S. weapon appeared to be the economic
embargo, which had already cut off much of Iraq's all-important oil
exports.
   Global solidarity looked unlikely, however. Two examples:
Indonesia said it would continue trading with Iraq; the
Netherlands, a U.S. ally, said it would allow a Dutch dredging
company to continue work to enlarge an Iraqi port on the Gulf.
   Bush said ``additional steps'' might be needed _ an allusion to
a naval blockade of Iraq orchestrated by the United States.
   The necessary U.S. warships were assembling. Nine U.S. Navy
vessels are now patrolling the Persian Gulf, Iraq's only direct sea
outlet, and a 15-ship task force led by the aircraft carrier USS
Independence was just outside the mouth of the strategic waterway.
In addition, the carrier Eisenhower, accompanied by five other
warships, passed through the Suez Canal on Wednesday en route to
the gulf.

   The Trident submarine USS Kentucky will be
christened Saturday _ with a special blend of Kentucky bourbons
instead of the traditional bottle of bubbly.
   Eight distilleries donated their most seasoned bourbon for the
event, according to a news release from U.S. Rep. Larry J. Hopkins,
R-Ky. Twelve Kentuckians assigned to the submarine will bottle the
whiskey during a special ceremony on land Thursday.
   Hopkins' wife, Carolyn, is to break the commemorative bottle
over the bow of the 560-foot, 18,750-ton submarine.
   The christening will take place at the Electric Boat division of
General Dynamics. Electric Boat is the sole builder of the Trident
submarine, which is designed to serve as an undersea
missile-launching platform. Electric Boat has already delivered 10
Tridents to the Navy.
   The boat will be the third Navy vessel named in honor of the
Bluegrass State, but it's the first to be christened with Kentucky
spirits, the release said.

   About 4,000 U.S. Marines were flown
to Saudi Arabia and Marine contingents were deployed Thursday near
Khafji, close to the kingdom's border with Iraqi-occupied Kuwait,
according to diplomatic sources.
   The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said
the Marines reached the area early Thursday morning. They did not
say how they were flown in or give other details of the airlift.
   The sources said no U.S. military planes had been landing at
Dhahran's international airport on Thursday but could be landing at
other air strips.
   Pentagon sources in Washington had reported that the American
planes and men would be flown to Riyadh, the capital, and Dhahran
on the Persian Gulf coast.
   The diplomatic sources said they did not know how far the
Marines were from the Khafji oil terminal, site of the Arabian Oil
Co., a Japanese concern.
   Executives in Khafji said that from their location they were not
aware of any extraordinary activities.
   The oil terminal lies 18 miles south of town and the border.
   The report of a Marine deployment in the oil-rich northeast
corner of Saudi Arabia was not immediately confirmed in Washington,
where President Bush announced Tuesday he had ordered ground and
air forces to Saudi Arabia to defend the kingdom against any Iraqi
aggression.
   American sources in Washington said about 5,000 ground troops
and 140 warplanes would be involved. But one diplomatic source in
the region said two U.S. army divisions, about 30,000 troops, were
on their way to Saudi Arabia. The U.S. sources had said elements of
three divisions _ not necessarily the entire divisions _ would be
sent to Saudi Arabia. But the discrepancy in reports could not
otherwise be immediately reconciled.
   Associated Press photographer Greg English reported after flying
over the Strait of Hormuz that about 30 oil tankers were anchored
outside the strait, about double the number over the weekend.
   English said few vessels ventured into the Persian Gulf itself.
   ``The whole of the southern gulf seemed like it had been
deserted overnight,'' he said.
   During an extensive morning overflight of the southern gulf,
English reported sighting only one Norwegian-flagged tanker sailing
out and one French warship.
   Shipping executives said that only ships with very strict
schedules or those that had been there already were inside the
gulf. They said those outside were the ones that were told they
could wait for further instructions.
   Loading at the main Saudi oil terminal of Ras Tanura was normal,
but one executive pointed out that the vessels were moving
cautiously and more slowly than usual.
   Loading was canceled, however, at Dubai's Jebel Ali terminal,
where ships were told that ``due to situation in gulf, loading will
not continue,'' the executives said.
   Jebel Ali cargo includes stored Iraqi oil products.

   A quarter-million motorcyclists have
converged on this small Black Hills town to enjoy races, tours and
general good times.
   The weeklong 50th Black Hills Motor Classic has turned the town
of 7,000 on the edge of western South Dakota's Black Hills into a
motorcycle mecca.
   ``It's great, mind blowing,'' Marguerite McNeill of Queensland,
Australia, said Tuesday. ``It seems to have all ages. It doesn't
matter what or who you are.''
   Motorcycles are parked on the six blocks of Main Street that
have been blocked off to other traffic. Bikes are parked on both
sides of the street and in double rows down the middle of every
block.
   The visitors included lawyers, bankers, police officers, doctors
and housewives.
   ``This is just unreal to see this many people,'' said Burt
Trumbower, wearing leather and a diamond stud in his left ear, as
he surveyed Main Street. Trumbower, 45, a postal inspector from St.
Paul, Minn., was attending his 17th rally.
   Two wedding parties zoomed up and down the streets, and another
couple was observed taking vows in a nearby park with a bearded,
leather-clad man officiating.
   Some attending the rally belong to established groups, such as
Hell's Angels, Banditos and Sons of Silence.
   The rally started small in 1940, and was dedicated to tours and
races. The races are still held, but over the years the parties
have taken precedence.
   ``I bet most people don't know the races go on,'' said Bruce
Hubbard, president of the Black Hills Motor Classic Board, which is
part of the local Chamber of Commerce. ``They just come to ride
their bikes, maybe drink a couple of beers and talk to their
buddies.''
   The gathering officially began Monday, but bikers began arriving
last week _ along with extra law enforcement offiicers. The rally
runs through Sunday.
   The rally's relatively mellow mood was broken Tuesday night when
police shot and killed a man who'd broken into a home after
pounding a knife blade about 2 feet through a door, authorities
said. The man also had threatened at least one other person and
caused other disturbances, said Mike Jackley, Meade County state's
attorney.
   Authorities would not release the man's name.
   ``This is a very isolated incident,'' said Jackley. ``There's no
good rational explanation for it. I'd say from the reports I've
seen he definitely was not acting rationally.''
   For the most part, the crowd is friendly, said Harold Sykora,
chairman of a task force of state agencies providing support
services for the rally.
   ``They seem to be polite. If you bump into someone on the
street, they'll say `Excuse me' and be on their way. People come
here to have a good time,'' Sykora said.

   Oliver North, a major figure in the
Iran-Contra arms scandal, says he has no political aspirations _
for now.
   North told the Loudoun (Va.) Times-Mirror in an interview
published Wednesday that he's formed an educational foundation that
will deal with politics on a grass-roots level.
   But the retired Marine lieutenant colonel told the newspaper,
``I have no political aspirations of my own.''
   He added, however, ``My daddy used to tell me, `Never say
never.''
   North has made similarly vague statements about his political
plans before, and that last remark is similar to one made in March
to USA Today.
   North also is a walking advertisement for one of his companies,
Guardian Technologies International Inc., which manufactures
bulletproof vests.
   ``I wear one every time I'm out in public,'' he said.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington last month set
aside all three of North's convictions in the Iran-Contra case.
   The court said there needed to be a hearing on whether there had
been improper use of testimony North gave Congress under a grant of
partial immunity.
   The court dismissed outright one count, citing faulty
instructions from the judge.

<TEXT>
   Take my flight, please, says a commuter airline,
which is putting comedians in the cabin to lighten up the short hop
between Cleveland and Detroit.
   On a flight too quick for work or napping, comedian Don Tersigni
reminded the crowd Wednesday on Continental Express' 50-minute
flight to Detroit, ``If you don't like my act, where are you going
to go?''
   The Detroit entertainer then launched into Sylvester Stallone
and Elvis Presley impersonations, with a bit of improvising.
   ``I couldn't hear myself, really,'' he said. ``Especially doing
impressions. I was just sort of winging it.''
   Said Boston businessman William Stadler, ``At least it wasn't
boring.''
   ``It's a good way to spend a short flight,'' said Robert
Anderson, an architect from the Detroit suburb of St. Clair Shores
who flies to Cleveland weekly.
   The commuter airline on Monday launched a week of in-flight
business talks and comedy to publicize the Detroit route it started
in February. Detroit is one of 15 cities the airline serves from
Cleveland.
   But for stand-up comics, some flights force a change of style.
   Comic Al Aprill did sit-down comedy when Flight 4454 en route to
Cleveland experienced turbulence Monday night.
   ``I was told our comedian does a real good job,'' said Capt.
Bill Daly. ``I'm sorry I can't let him stand up.''
   Earlier Wednesday, most of the 17 passengers on the 30-seat
plane stayed awake to hear Detroit Free Press assistant business
editor Nunzio Lupo give a 20-minute talk on the labor negotiations
going on between the Big Three automakers and the United Auto
Workers union.
   Passengers applauded Lupo after the flight, and, perhaps more
importantly, listened to the airline's emergency instructions.
   ``In the morning it's really hard. They'll sleep, or read their
paper. They don't listen to my demo,'' said flight attendant Lisa
Lyons of Erie, Pa.
   Detroit dentist Frank Markie said Lupo's talk ``shortens the
time'' and that flights are ``usually pretty boring.''
   The morning airborne business briefings and evening flights with
comedians have been popular enough that the Continental Airlines
commuter-feeder line may try them on other routes, spokeswoman
Nancy Compel said.
   ``It's a lot different than entertaining a nightclub crowd,''
Tersigni said.

<HEAD>Quebec Asks Military Help in Mohawk Standoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Quebec has asked the federal government to
send in soldiers ``to ensure public security'' in a month-long
armed standoff between Mohawks and provincial police, Premier
Robert Bourassa said Wednesday.
   In another development, the Mohawks and the federal government
announced agreement on a mediator to bring the parties back to the
bargaining table.
   Bourassa had given the Mohawks a 48-hour ultimatum that ran out
Wednesday to either resume talks or face unspecified consequences.
The dispute has polarized Canadians, spurring both sympathy
protests by other Indians and anti-Indian demonstrations.
   At his news conference in Quebec City, Bourassa said he wants
the military's role to be peaceful. ``There's no question at this
stage of an armed assault,'' he said.
   He did not say when or how many soldiers would move into the
town of Oka, where police and Mohawks have faced each other behind
barricades since a gun battle July 11.
   A policeman was killed during that fight, which broke out when
police stormed a barricade erected by Mohawks to stop the expansion
of a local golf course on land the Mohawks claim as ancestral.
Blame in that killing has not been established.
   Bourassa said the soldiers will back up provincial police
because ``for the last month, they've had a very difficult job that
they've done very courageously.''
   Calling in the army to Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, does not
mean that civil liberties are being curtailed, Bourassa said. He
said the military will take its orders from provincial police.
   Loran Thompson, a Mohawk spokesman, said he was not surprised
nor overly concerned about the military's arrival.
   ``We're hoping the army just stays out there and tries to
maintain peace,'' he said.
   Asked if the Indians fear an assault, Thompson said,``That's
always possible, but we're advised that our men are ready if it
comes to that.''
   There was no immediate comment on the military role from federal
officials.
   In separate remarks, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said
the negotiator in the dispute will be Alan B. Gold, chief justice
of Quebec Superior Court. He said Gold's job will be to ``clarify
any pre-conditions, and having addressed these matters, he will
take steps for the commencement of substantive negotiations.''
   Mohawk negotiator Joe Deom said in a statement that the Indians
had agreed to Gold's role. But he added that ``nothing has
changed'' in the Mohawks' demands.
   The talks bogged down over the Mohawks' conditions: free
movement of food and Mohawk advisers across the barricades, and the
presence of international observers.
   Deom said the Mohawk barricades will remain during the talks.
   Federal officials plan to buy the disputed land to block the
golf course addition.

   Pakistan's new leader said Wednesday
he will hold elections in October, but ousted Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto raised doubts about that promise and the future of
democracy in the country.
   After Ms. Bhutto's government was abruptly dismissed Monday,
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan set new elections for Oct. 24. He
accused the government of corruption and nepotism.
   On Wednesday, acting Prime Minister Mustafa Jatoi, the former
opposition leader, said he intends to carry out the plan for
October voting.
   ``Elections is our priority,'' said Jatoi, speaking to reporters
for the first time since taking office. ``I unequivocally declare
that I will fulfill this promise.''
   He said an election commission had been formed and had begun to
set the timetable for the balloting.
   However, Ms. Bhutto said she doubted elections would be held.
She predicted the military that has ruled Pakistan for much of its
43-year history would soon seize power.
   ``The caretaker government will not last. Within a few weeks,
the army will take over,'' Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference in
her hometown of Karachi.
   She also said the military had threatened to take over unless
the president dismissed her government.
   The army denied her allegations, and Jatoi told reporters he was
``astonished'' by the former prime minister's remarks.
   ``The army has played a positive role in helping to restore
democracy,'' he said. ``This is her expression of gratitude.''
   Ms. Bhutto inherited the political mantle of her father, the
late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He was ousted by Gen.
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in a 1977 coup and hanged two years later.
   Zia himself was killed in a mysterious plane crash on Aug. 17,
1988. His death led to the first democratic elections after more
than a decade of military rule.
   When Ms. Bhutto led her party to victory and took office in
December 1988, she pledged to restore democracy.
   Diplomats and political analysts also voiced skepticism
Wednesday about the date of elections, pointing out that the
interim administration is comprised largely of Ms. Bhutto's
fiercest critics.
   They also cited the threat of war with neighboring India over
the disputed territory of Kashmir.
   The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, said October
elections were not certain.
   ``I agree there is a question mark,'' Oakley said at a seminar.
``I retain the same feeling at the moment that the chances are
reasonably good.''
   But he added, ``There's always the impact of whether a
government is true to its words.''
   The president dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government, citing a long
list of charges ranging from official greed to misuse of power. She
has repeatedly denied the allegations, saying anyone with proof
should take it to court.
   Corruption is endemic in Pakistan, but Jatoi said it had
flourished at unprecedented levels during Ms. Bhutto's
administration.
   ``Rampant corruption and the complete breakdown of law and order
necessitated the president's constitutional action,'' he said.
``The priorities of my government are going to be to continue the
democratic process while cleansing our society of the negative
influences of the past 20 months.''
   ``Accountability in accordance with law is the demand of the
people and will also be initiated,'' he said. ``Those who looted
and plundered the economy of the nation and the treasury cannot go
scot-free.''
   He said tribunals would be set up to investigate the charges and
empowered to disqualify candidates from election and assess
punishment.
   However, he said there would be no witch hunt against the former
government.

<HEAD>Trial of 2 Live Crew Members Set For October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge on Wednesday set Oct.
9 for the obscenity trial of three members of the rap music group 2
Live Crew.
   Broward County Circuit Judge June Johnson set the date after
rescinding bench warrants issued earlier in the day because the
defendants' attorneys didn't appear for a docket hearing. The
attorneys, contacted by the court, appeared later and told the
judge they hadn't been notified of the hearing.
   County sheriff's deputies arrested 2 Live Crew leader Luther
Campbell and member Chris Wongwon after a June concert in
Hollywood, Fla., at which the rappers sang sexually explicit lyrics
from their ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album. The record had been
ruled obscene U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez.
   A third member, Mark Ross, was charged later in the case. The
group has four members.
   Each of the three defendants is charged with one count of
misdemeanor obscenity, and faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine.
   The album has stirred the debate on obscenity and free speech.
   An Indiana judge last week ruled that the million-selling album
violates standards of decency and should not be sold to minors, and
Dallas prosecutors filed charges against two store chains for
selling it. The record has also been banned from record stores in
San Antonio.

<HEAD>Hurricane Diana Passes, Leaves Mexican Coast Town a Wreck</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TUXPAN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Diana was well inland and
appeared to be blowing itself out Wednesday after wrecking this
coastal oil town of 120,000.
   Mexico's National Meteorological Service said Diana, now
downgraded to a tropical depression, was over Central Mexico
heading west, but could still cause heavy rains there and as far
south as the Valley of Mexico.
   Tuxpan had long been lucky. The hurricanes that sweep the Gulf
of Mexico always seemed to veer away and spin north toward Texas.
``It was as if we had divine protection,'' said Mayor Perecles
Namorado.
   The luck ran out Tuesday when Hurricane Diana smashed this city
head-on with winds estimated at up to 120 mph, killing at least two
people, injuring eight and leaving thousands homeless.
   Two other fatalities were reported in the Veracruz area to the
south.
   High tides and flooding in Veracruz, Tampico, Tuxpan and
elsewhere forced thousands to flee.
   The U.S. National Hurricane Center near Miami meanwhile reported
that a tropical depression gained strength off Africa on Wednesday
and headed toward the Azores as tropical storm Edouard. It is the
fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs
through the end of November.
   Tuxpan was cut off from the rest of the world when Hurricane
Diana peaked. Telephone lines to the outside were down and radio
contact was lost.
   Mayor Namorado said power was cut, partly to prevent danger from
downed power lines, which ran through smashed roof tiles, tree
trunks and bent sign boards in the darkened streets.
   Downed trees surrounded the bandstand in the city's Benito
Juarez Plaza.
   The mayor said more than 4,000 houses in Tuxpan were damaged too
badly to occupy.
   Police Commander Jorge Ramos Mundo said a 12-year-old girl died
when a power line fell on her home and a 52-year-old woman was
killed by a collapsing wall.
   Thousands of Tuxpan residents returned home from shelters at
daylight Wednesday to find their houses smashed or damaged.
   ``Everything is drenched,'' moaned Alejandra Castan, whose wood
slat house lost its corrugated metal roof. ``We didn't have time to
remove anything.''
   ``We had confidence in Tuxpan that the hurricanes would never
come,'' fisherman Bartolo Gomez said, and then waved toward wrecked
houses nearby.
   ``Roofs began to fly. Trees fell. The lights went. We lost
communication.''
   Residents said the storm hit twice. In between, for about an
hour, Tuxpan was in the eye of the storm.
   ``It was totally calm. There was no rain. There was no wind. The
sun even came out,'' Ramos said.

   Britain pledged military backing Wednesday for a
U.S.-led multinational force to deter Iraqi aggression. West
Germany, Italy and Spain offered bases, but Egypt and Morocco _
considered the likeliest Arab participants _ refused to join.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III made a surprise
announcement that the United States also is turning to Syria and
Iran as potential partners to rein in Iraq, though U.S. relations
with both have long been hostile.
   The enmity between Syria and Iraq is possibly surpassed only by
that between Iran and Iraq.
   En route to Turkey, Baker told reporters he was sending an envoy
to Syria and confirmed the United States has been in touch with
Iran through ``third party contacts.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, responding to a direct
appeal from Saudi Arabia's King Fahd as well as U.S. requests, was
the only leader to offer ships and planes for the multinational
force.
   Despite leaks by U.S. sources at the Pentagon that Egypt and
Morocco were potential members, both countries denied any agreement
to participate.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt spurned the U.S.-led
multinational force, whose first troops and aircraft landed in
Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. But he said Egypt would consider
committing troops to an Arab force that would act as a buffer
between Iraq and Kuwait.
   Mubarak will act as host at an emergency Arab summit on Thursday
in Cairo to discuss the crisis sparked by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait last Thursday. Saddam proclaimed
Wednesday he had annexed Kuwait.
   Mubarak spokesman Mohammed Abdel-Monein on Wednesday listed the
countries that would attend as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Algeria,
Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Libya and Qatar. Egypt's
Middle East News Agency also listed Morocco and Jordan.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi arrived in Egypt Wednesday
night.
   The Kuwaiti news agency Kuna said it was told by Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmed Al Jaber, deputy prime minister and foreign minister in
the exiled Kuwaiti government, that the exiled administration
accepted an invitation to attend.
   Kuna quoted exiled government sources as saying Crown Prince
Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Alsalim, prime minister in exile, would
lead the delegation.
   ``I am afraid that Iraq will be struck by a harsh strike from
the outside,'' Mubarak said in a nationally televised speech. ``The
picture I see is black. I call on President Saddam to respond to an
Arab umbrella and to withdraw his force.''
   Military units of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council _
Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and
Kuwait _ already are in Saudi Arabia and could become part of the
multinational force.
   The council's force, called ``Peninsula Shield,'' consists of
two infantry brigades, one Saudi and one comprising units from the
other countries. With an estimated 3,000 troops and 100 U.S.-made
tanks, the brigades are currently at Hafr el-Baten in northeast
Saudi Arabia.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd offered British military
forces, but said it was too soon to say which countries would
contribute to the multinational force.
   ``The essential point is Saddam Hussein now knows an attack on
Saudi Arabia, were he to contemplate one, would not be an attack on
Saudi Arabia alone,'' Hurd said.
   Other members of the 16-nation NATO military alliance and the
12-nation European Community appeared to be holding back on
military commitments for now.
   Italy said it agreed to let bases be used to help facilitate
transport of troops and equipment and for logistical support,
Premier Giulio Andreotti's office announced.
   Spain, whose Premier Felipe Gonzalez opposes outside
intervention in the Persian Gulf, nonetheless agreed to allow the
United States to use four jointly operated military bases to
support U.S. troops.
   Bonn signaled readiness to allow the U.S. military to use
American facilities in West Germany as a ``basis for operations''
for soldiers headed to Saudi Arabia.
   West Germany said Tuesday its constitution bars use of German
troops outside the country.
   Greece said nine U.S. support planes were granted permission to
pass through Greek airspace on their way to the Persian Gulf.
   France, which has two ships in the Gulf of Oman and a frigate
with Exocet missiles en route, said Wednesday ``no participation is
envisaged at this stage'' in the multinational force.
   The Soviet Union offered no immediate military or moral support,
but its silence was seen as a tacit endorsement of the U.S. moves.
   The Soviets have condemned the Iraqi invasion and pledged their
full commitment to the U.N. economic embargo against Baghdad.
   Chinese Premier Li Peng said in Jakarta, Indonesia, that China
would respect Saudi Arabia's decision to allow U.S. troops on its
soil.
   Japan expressed support for the U.S. decision to send troops
into Saudi Arabia as a defensive measure.

   U.S. warplanes and combat troops, backed by an
armada of Navy ships, have taken up defensive positions in and near
Saudi Arabia, U.S. military officials said Wednesday. Some Air
National Guard units were called up for active duty.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney described the deployment as ``a
major commitment of U.S. forces'' that included elements of the
82nd Airborne Division and F-15 fighter jets. He declined to
provide specifics, citing security concerns.
   Terming the military situation ``uncertain'' after Iraq
President Saddam Hussein's ``act of infamy'' in invading Kuwait,
Cheney indicated American forces could be in the region for months.
   About 5,000 ground troops and more than 100 F-15 fighter planes
were ordered to the region, congressional and Pentagon sources
reported, and 4,000 Marines were said by diplomatic sources to have
been moved close to the Saudi-Kuwait border. Nearly 40 warships and
escort vessels _ some armed with sophisticated cruise missiles
programmed to destroy specific Iraqi targets _ will be in Mideast
waters by next week, the sources said.
   What was announced in Washington was evidently only part of the
story. Reports of other troop movements arrived throughout the day.
   Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey announced in Trenton that the
170th Air Refueling Group of his state's Air National Guard had
been called up. Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York said his state's 105th
Military Airlift Group, which flew transport missions in the
invasion of Panama, had been called to active duty with his
agreement.
   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said A-10 air-to-ground attack jets
from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base had left for Saudi Arabia. Unlike
the F-15, an ``air superiority'' fighter designed to tangle with
other planes, the A-10 was designed to attack ground targets, and
its six-barrelled 30mm anti-tank cannon has been described as the
best anti-tank weapon in the world.
   Diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said 4,000 U.S. Marines had
been deployed at Khafji, a Saudi oil-terminal town on the border
with Kuwait. It was not known where they came from, though Marines
had been based at Diego Garcia, the U.S. island bastion in the
Indian Ocean about 1,500 miles away.
   One of the diplomatic sources said the U.S. ground commitment
would be 30,000.
   The movement of troops, ships and planes will take ``several
days at least,'' said one Pentagon source early Wednesday evening.
   This source, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that most
of the 82nd Airborne Division was still in the United States. He
did not, however, say how much of the division would be moved to
Saudi Arabia.
   The build-up appeared to be going well without major
difficulties, the source said.
   At present, two aircraft carriers bristling with 80 to 90
aircraft each are within striking distance of Iraqi targets.
Another is on the way.
   ``Our purpose ... is to deter any further Iraqi aggression,''
Cheney said. He said he expected other nations to join the military
effort but declined to name any except Britain.
   ``The mission of the armed forces is to take up defensive
positions,'' said Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
   Powell expressed confidence American sailors, soldiers and
airmen were prepared for battle in the hostile, desert environment
if called upon.
   ``We've trained for it, we've exercised in it,'' he said.
   And while Iraq's million-man army has been hardened by its
eight-year war with Iran, he said, ``They are not invincible. They
are not ten feet tall.''
   Cheney and Powell briefed a packed room of reporters in the
Pentagon, standing in front of a map of the Saudi region that
identified some of the major U.S. units that had been deployed, but
not all of them.
   Asked for information on U.S. troop movements or the size of the
sudden deployment, Powell replied simply: ``You can be sure that
for the mission we have been given we will put in adequate forces.''
   Cheney and Powell said the aircraft carrier USS Independence and
its support ships have taken up positions just outside the Persian
Gulf and the carrier USS Eisenhower is in the Red Sea _ not far
from the end point of an Iraqi oil pipeline and within range for
the carrier's aircraft and other weapons to engage Iraqi forces.
   Powell said the troops brought with them protective clothing and
medical supplies to be used in the event Iraq uses chemical weapons
against the American forces.
   The briefing came after President Bush delivered a nationally
televised address announcing his decision to send U.S. forces into
the tense Persian Gulf region.
   Pentagon sources said the U.S. arsenal will include heavy tanks,
dispatched aboard Marine supply ships from the secret U.S.
facilities on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Other
supplies were en route from Guam, in the Pacific, the sources said.
   The battleship Wisconsin, steaming across the Atlantic with the
aircraft carrier Saratoga, had 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles
programmed to destroy specific Iraqi targets, sources said.
   And a second Navy cruiser has been added to the Navy's task
force in the Persian Gulf, bringing the number of U.S. ships in the
strategic waterway to nine.
   Powell and Cheney added that the aircraft carrier Eisenhower,
accompanied by the warships Scott and Ticonderoga, had gone through
the Suez Canal on its way to the scene.
   Five AWACs, Airborne Warning and Control aircraft, sold to the
Saudis in the late 1970s, had been put on station in central Saudi
Arabia, they said.
   Cheney said his discussion with the Saudis on a quick visit
earlier this week had also resulted in Bush's waiver of a
congressional limit on the transfer of F-15 fighter jets to Saudi
Arabia, permitting a dozen of the sophisticated aircraft to be
shipped to the kingdom.

   A federal immigration judge on Wednesday
granted permanent U.S. residency to a Soviet woman who was involved
in a highly publicized custody battle with her American husband.
   After a one-hour hearing, immigration officials agreed to drop
efforts to deport Inna Yurevna Carver to the Soviet Union.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in January
denied Ms. Carver's request that it waive certain requirements for
permanent residence.
   ``First it was my love and dream to live here,'' Ms. Carver, 27,
said after the hearing. ``But I had also burned my bridges with
Russia. I feel wonderful _ I love this country.''
   Ms. Carver drew attention two years ago when she battled to gain
custody of her 14-month-old son, Tristan. The baby and her
estranged husband, John Paul Carver, were found in Mexico in 1989,
a year after he took the baby.
   Carver was arrested in Texas in March 1989 and given a one-year
deferred sentence last December for abandoning his wife and taking
the baby.
   A psychologist testified during custody proceedings that Carver
believed his former wife was involved in Soviet espionage.
   During Wednesday's testimony, Ms. Carver said the only reason
she came to the United States was her love and devotion to Carver.
   The two met and married in the Soviet Union in 1986. Their son
was born there in 1987 before the family moved to Edmond, Okla.,
later that year. They were divorced in June.
   She said her reasons for seeking divorce included physical and
mental abuse.
   ``I was never treated like this in my life,'' Ms. Carver said.
   U.S. Immigration Judge John Duck denied several attempts by INS
general counsel James Reynolds to continue the hearing until Carver
could be present. Duck said he had reviewed past claims by Carver
and found them ``completely uncredible.''
   ``I'm not going to give a great bit of weight to what that man
says,'' Duck said.
   Reynolds then agreed to drop the deportation case, and told Ms.
Carver's attorney no appeals would be made.
   Ms. Carver said she will stay in Norman, work toward an
education degree at the University of Oklahoma and seek U.S.
citizenship.
   ``I really feel a lot of relief,'' she said. ``I thought it
would be a little more vicious.''

<HEAD>Soviet Interior Minister Wants Weapons Confiscation Deadline
Extended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Interior Minister has recommended that
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev extend his Thursday deadline for
militants to disarm and disband.
   Vadim Bakatin told the official news agency Tass Wednesday he
was making the suggestion because new leaders have come to power in
Armenia, which hosts the country's biggest and most defiant force
of militants.
   Gorbachev, trying to quell ethnic violence that has shaken this
multinational country, declared July 26 that militants nationwide
have 15 days to turn in their weapons.
   But many militants, especially those in Armenia which is locked
in a territorial dispute with neighboring Azerbaijan, have refused
to comply with Gorbachev's decree.
   More than 200 people have been killed in ethnic clashes between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis over control of the disputed territory
of Nagorno-Karabakh, which Azerbaijan has held since 1923.
   Soviet officials have warned that force would be used to
confiscate any illegal weapons they can find after the deadline
expired.
   There was no immediate word whether Gorbachev, who is
vacationing, had agreed to Bakatin's recommendation. The Interior
Minister did not say how long the deadline should be extended.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said Wednesday that only a
handful of the militants' estimated thousands of weapons have been
turned in.
   ``The appeal to humanness and reason, inherent in the demand to
hand over arms and stop bloodshed, did not find support among those
who heighten criminal tensions in the country,'' Pravda said.
   Bakatin said about 1,600 firearms and more than 100,000 rounds
of ammunition were voluntarily handed in or confiscated from July
25 through Wednesday.
   In Armenia, 6,700 firearms, including 1,200 submachine guns,
have been stolen this year, Pravda said.
   The Armenian parliament rejected Gorbachev's order as
interference in the republic's internal affairs, and has begun
debating an independence declaration.
   But Bakatin appeared hopeful because of the election of a new
president of Armenia. The president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, arrived
in Moscow on Wednesday for two days of talks with Soviet and
Russian Federation leaders on the weapons decree and other issues,
Tass reported.
   Bakatin, who met Ter-Petrosyan on Wednesday, told Tass, ``Until
recently, republican authorities did not take a constructive
attitude. However, there are grounds to maintain that the political
situation in the republic is changing.
   ``Hope has appeared that Armenian authorities can resolve,
within a short period and on their own, all tasks concerning ...
the stabilization of the socio-political situation in the
republic.''
   Bakatin said the Interior Ministry consulted with Armenia's new
leaders and that they agreed on ``the need to strengthen law and
order, protect citizens and rule out the unlawful bearing of arms.''
   Ter-Petrosyan, a leader of the Armenian National Movement, told
his republic's parliament on Tuesday that Armenia could handle its
own problems _ a response to Kremlin threats to send in troops to
enforce order if Gorbachev's decree on weapons is ignored.
   But it was unclear whether he would directly ask the militants
to give up their weapons and if he did, whether they would comply.
   The Soviet Interior Ministry faced a problem with another
southern republic, Georgia. Georgian President Givi Gumbaridze told
Tass his republic would not enforce Gorbachev's order until the
republic's parliamehnt ends its session on Aug. 17.

   The Broadway production of the hit London
musical ``Miss Saigon'' was canceled by its producer Wednesday
after an actors' union refused to let a white British actor play
the role of a Eurasian.
   ```Miss Saigon' is dead for this season,'' said Richard Maltby
Jr., co-lyricist of the musical. ``It would be hard to crank up
again.''
   The decision by producer Cameron Mackintosh came after the
union's council voted Tuesday to bar English star Jonathan Pryce
from repeating his portrayal of an amoral brothel owner.
   ``The debate is no longer about the casting of `Miss Saigon' but
the art of acting itself,'' Mackintosh said in a statement issued
on behalf of the show's creative team.
   The show, which had been scheduled to open in March at the
Broadway Theater, is a love story set during the closing days of
the Vietnam War. It had an advance ticket sale of more than $25
million, the largest in Broadway history. Mackintosh said the money
will be refunded.
   He said an estimated $600,000 spent on pre-production work for
the show has been lost.
   ``The Shubert Organization has turned down bookings of other
productions in order to reserve the Broadway Theater for `Miss
Saigon,' and now has incurred a substantial loss as well,''
Mackintosh said.
   Pryce said he was shocked to learn the union had turned him down
for the role.
   ``Once the shock has worn off, I think I'm going to feel pretty
angry about it,'' he said.
   Mackintosh's action came after the council of Actor's Equity
voted on whether Pryce, a respected British performer who has
appeared on Broadway twice before, should star in the American
production of ``Miss Saigon.''
   ``The casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an
affront to the Asian community,'' said Alan Eisenberg, the union's
executive secretary. Eisenberg said the union's decision was made
``in full awareness that many jobs may be lost to actors of Asian
background if the production is canceled.''
   ``The issue of lost money was really not a factor in
discussions,'' he added.
   The economic impact could be enormous. The trade newspaper
Variety calculated that the New York production of ``Miss Saigon''
alone would have employed about 182 people, including 50 actors and
stage managers, 26 musicians and 34 stagehands. The show-business
weekly said payroll benefits would total more than $200,000 a week.
   ``I think Actors' Equity misjudged Cameron Mackintosh,'' Maltby
said. ``They didn't understand that if the show wasn't done to
Cameron's standards, he just as soon not have it done.''
   Mackintosh declined to take the matter to arbitration, a process
Equity suggested Tuesday might be the next step.
   The controversy arose several weeks ago after Actor's Equity
received letters of complaint from playwright David Henry Hwang and
actor B.D. Wong about the casting of Pryce.
   ``Ten days ago, I informed Actors' Equity that I would support
whatever decision they determined to be in the best interests of
their membership,'' Hwang, author of the Broadway hit ``M.
Butterfly,'' said Wednesday. ``It has certainly never been my
intention to see a show canceled; I simply felt that an important
point had to be made, and this has clearly been achieved.''

   China and Indonesia formally resumed
diplomatic relations Wednesday after a 23-year suspension.
   Indonesia suspended ties in 1967 after accusing Beijing of
complicity in a Communist coup attempt two years earlier. China
never acknowledged involvement.
   President Suharto and Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng looked on
as their foreign ministers, Ali Alatas of Indonesia and Qian Qichen
of China, signed the documents at Merdeka (Freedom) Palace.
   In a speech at a state dinner honoring Li Tuesday night, Suharto
called the signing a milestone that ``marks a new era in the
relations of our peoples and nations.''
   After the signing, Li stressed that China had no intention to
support any underground Coummunists in Indonesia.
   ``For more than 23 years our relations have been suspended. But
now both countries have resumed diplomatic relations and so we are
now moving toward developing better understanding and we both
agreed to let bygones be bygones,'' Li said.
   Under terms of the memorandum of understanding signed Wednesday,
Indonesia recognizes only one China and that Taiwan is an integral
part of China. It says Indonesia maintains only economic and trade
relations of a non-governmental nature with Taiwan.
   The Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan still claims to be
the legitimate government of all China.
   A trade pact also was signed Wednesday under which the two
countries will grant each other most-favored-nation status with
respect to customs duties and other taxes.

   As President Bush dispatched U.S. troops to
Saudi Arabia, Iraq turned over a 10-year-old girl to U.S. diplomats
in Baghdad but kept 38 other Americans confined to a hotel under
armed guard in what one official described as a ``potentially
scary'' situation.
   The girl, Penelope Nabokov of Albany, Calif., was taken from the
hotel to the U.S. embassy by agreement with Iraqi officials, State
Department officials said Wednesday night.
   While the U.S. concern was focused on the Americans sequestered
at the Hotel Rashid in Baghdad, the State Department also was
worried about the thousands of other Americans in Iraq and in
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   Some Americans reportedly have been the target of threats by
Iraqi forces in Kuwait.
   A week after the Iraqi conquest of Kuwait, with borders in both
countries and airports closed, the Americans were still not free to
leave.
   This raised concern in Washington that Iraqi authorities might
find them politically useful at a time of escalating military
tensions with the Bush administration. The State Department has
refused to call them hostages.
   There are an estimated 3,000 Americans in Kuwait and 400 in
Iraq, 100 fewer than previous estimates.
   Bush told reporters that there had been some encouraging signs
concerning the Americans, apparently referring to statements by
Iraqi officials that all would be allowed to leave.
   But none of the statements have proved to be authoritative, and
U.S. officials expressed frustration over the their inability to
obtain a firm commitment from the Iraqis to allow the Americans to
leave.
   Asked about the status of the 39, State Department deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher said, ``Their status is that they cannot
leave the hotel grounds, but they have full use of the facility.
There are armed guards located at the hotel, but the Americans have
not been threatened.''
   Boucher spoke before Penelope was moved to the embassy. The girl
had been flying alone from her grandmother in France to join her
mother in India when she and other passengers on a British Airways
plane were caught during a refueling stop by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait last Thursday.
   One of the officials who disclosed her transfer to the embassy
said he did not know where she would go next or when. This official
spoke on condition that his name not be used.
   The top U.S. diplomat in Baghdad, Joseph Wilson, as well as
other consular officials, have met with the Americans at the hotel.
That group includes the 11 oil workers who were taken from the
border region in Kuwait a few days ago, 25 people brought by bus
from Kuwait City, and three who were already at the hotel.
   Boucher said the Iraqis have given contradictory statements
concerning the Americans in Iraq and Kuwait. One explanation given
for their lack of permission to leave is that the airport and the
borders have been closed for security reasons, said one official,
asking not to be identified.
   American envoys also have been told that the granting of exit
visas takes time, the official said.
   As for the reports of Iraqi forces threatening people, Boucher
said there is no evidence that Americans or other foreigners are
being singled out.
   ``We're certainly concerned about the incidents which have
occurred and we have raised these with the Iraqi government,''
Boucher said.
   ``We have repeatedly reminded the Iraqi government of their
responsibility for the safety of Americans and other foreigners,
and we expect the Iraqi government to carry out its pledges to
ensure the safety of foreigners and the security of diplomatic
premises.''
   Bush told reporters that he was concerned about the Americans
because of the ``unpredictable'' nature of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   He said protection of American life was ``fundamental to my job
and responsibilities as president.''

<HEAD>Man Kills Ex-Wife's Daughter, Shoots Self, Police Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who abducted his ex-wife and her
13-year-old daughter bludgeoned the girl to death, then shot
himself in the head when police stormed his home Wednesday,
authorities said.
   Ed Sugg, whose age was unknown, was in critical condition at a
Paris hospital, officials there said. His ex-wife, whose name was
not released, also was beaten, and was in stable condition with
head injuries.
   Police Chief Karl Louis said Sugg apparently used a baseball bat
to beat the woman and her daughter at the woman's Paris home, then
took them to his home early Wednesday morning and bound them.
   ``At one point, the suspect then left to clean up the crime
scene _ there was blood all over the woman's home and porch _ and
in that time, the woman managed to free herself and escape,'' Louis
said.
   ``She realized her daughter was dead and made her way to a
nearby home where she called the sheriff's department,'' he said.
   Louis said Sugg apparently returned to his home without going
back to his ex-wife's home. State, Lamar County and city
law-enforcement officers surrounded Sugg's home at mid-morning but
got no response from him.
   A tactical unit stormed the home late in the afternoon, and Sugg
fired one shot into his head, Louis said.

   The FBI settled a lawsuit filed against it by
a black agent who complained he had been a victim of racial
discrimination, the bureau said Wednesday.
   The FBI statement announcing the agreement did not give details,
including whether any payment was made to Donald Rochon, a special
agent who sued over alleged discrimination against him in the
bureau's Chicago office.
   In January the FBI settled racial discrimination complaints by
two other employees, Leadell Lee, a Chicago agent, and Gertie
Armstrong, a clerk in Omaha.
   Rochon's lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington alleged he
was the butt of racial jokes and death threats in the Chicago
office.
   Rochon also had worked in Omaha and complained of racial
harassment there. That complaint was upheld in administrative
proceedings and was not part of the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit accused FBI supervisors of tolerating racial
harassment against Rochon and his family and retaliating against
him for complaining.
   Rochon had been assigned to the Philadelphia office, but the FBI
statement Wednesday said part of the settlement provided that he
``will not return to active duty with the FBI.''
   It did not say when he left active duty. FBI officials were
unable to answer questions about the case Wednesday night.
   The FBI agreed to settle the case to ``avoid the disruption to
the FBI's operations and the drain on its resources which I believe
would have resulted from a bitterly contested trial,'' FBI Director
William Sessions said in the statement.
   In January, Rochon's attorney, David Kairys, said his case was
strengthened by settlement of the complaints by Lee and Ms.
Armstrong.

<HEAD>Security Council Discusses Iraqi Annexation of Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday
night discussed a proposed resolution condemning the Iraqi
annexation of Kuwait.
   The talks followed the council's vote Monday to impose a global
embargo on Iraqi products, including its oil. The 15-member council
formally denounced the Aug. 2 invasion hours after it began.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering said after Wednesday's
closed-door talks that he expects a unanimous vote Thursday to
condemn the annexation.
   ``In the informal consultation, I was impressed by the degree of
unanimity,'' Pickering said. ``Everybody in there is ready to go
ahead and condemn the annexation.''
   Mohammad Abulhasan, Kuwait's U.N. ambassador, called the
annexation ``bullying of a whole country by force and annexing it
without the will of the people.''
   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Amir al-Anbari, said the annexation was
declared at the request of Kuwait's new government, which Iraq
installed after its invasion.
   Al-Anbari said Kuwait's government had asked in a letter to
Iraqi officials ``that Iraq and Kuwait merge together into one
state.''
   The U.N. resolution under consideration declares ``null and
void'' the annexation and any other attempts to ``alter the status
of Kuwait.''
   The proposed measure also calls on all U.N. member nations and
international groups ``to refrain from any action or dealings that
might be interpreted to be an indirect recognition of the
annexation.''
   The draft resolution also reaffirms the Security Council's
``determination to bring the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by
Iraq to an end and to restore the sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity of Kuwait.''
   The Security Council is the U.N. body that handles issues
relating to international peace and security. Its resolution are
legally binding on all U.N. members, although past council
resolutions have often been ignored or flouted. The United Nations
has no enforcement mechanism.

   The deployment of U.S. warplanes and lightly
armed Army battalions to Saudi Arabia provides a strategic, but
highly risky, toehold against Iraq's menacing million-man army,
private military analysts say.
   The Bush administration said it views the 100,000 Iraqi soldiers
near the Saudi border as an ``imminent threat'' to Saudi security
after the forces of President Saddam Hussein conquered tiny Kuwait
and its vast oil riches last week.
   Under the Saudi desert lie the largest oil reserves in the world.
   Military experts interviewed Tuesday said placing American
ground forces in Saudi Arabia, even in relatively small numbers,
could be the start of a protracted and dangerous U.S. commitment.

   The cutoff of oil from Iraq is putting smiles on
the faces of those in the struggling U.S. oil industry.
   Houston, America's energy capital, has been crawling toward
recovery after prices plunged in the 1980s. Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and the U.N. embargo on Iraqi oil could speed things up.
   U.S. oil companies began last year to increase exploration
budgets, and new drilling and exploration techniques have brought
about regional booms. But a sustained increase in oil prices
because of the Persian Gulf crisis could spur domestic drilling and
attract investors scared off in the 1980s, observers said.
   ``There is an air of expectancy,'' said John Faulkinberry, chief
financial officer of Paramount Petroleum Co., an oil and gas
exploration and production company. ``This one event could really
heat things up. It could drive up drilling activity and bring
capital back into the industry.''

   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Miller had 576,226

   In Kansas, Hayden narrowly defeated real estate executive Nestor

   The gaily painted carousel on the National
Mall is still taking tourists on a gentle musical swing through
yesteryear, but officials at the Smithsonian Institution's nearby
headquarters are bracing for a bumpy financial ride into the future.
   Anticipating a new era of austerity after a quarter-century of
extraordinary expansion, the Smithsonian is delaying the start of
several major construction and renovation projects and searching
for ways to trim its costly payroll of 6,600 employees.
   At the moment, Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian,
is gratified that a House subcommittee recently voted to boost his
federal appropriation next year by nearly 18 percent, from $267
million to $313 million, even more than he had requested.
   Nevertheless, Adams is worried about ominous portents of a
long-term budget squeeze, including economic disruptions from the
Persian Gulf crisis and the threat of ``almost unbelievably
devastating'' automatic spending cuts in mid-October under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.

   Actors' Equity has barred a white actor from
playing a Eurasian in the Broadway musical ``Miss Saigon,''
stirring debate over color-blind casting and minority opportunities
on stage.
   The union Tuesday denied Englishman Jonathan Pryce permission to
repeat his award-winning performance as a brothel owner when the
London hit comes to New York in March.
   ``The casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an
affront to the Asian community,'' said Alan Eisenberg, the union's
executive secretary.
   Cameron Mackintosh, producer of ``Miss Saigon,'' has threatened
to cancel the show, the most anticipated musical of the coming
theater season, if Pryce is not allowed to perform. The musical,
set in the final days of the Vietnam War, already has a $24 million
advance, the largest in Broadway history.
   Mackintosh was vacationing Tuesday in France and could not be
reached for comment, said spokesman Marc Thibodeau.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1972, G. Gordon Liddy played a key role in
the Washington production of The Gang That Couldn't Break In
Straight.
   But he has come a long way from that effort, which earned him
bad reviews and 52 months in prison for masterminding the break-in
at Democratic National Committee's offices at the Watergate Hotel.
   The former intelligence chief for the committee to re-elect
then-president Richard Nixon, Liddy now has become an occasional
actor, among other things. He's usually cast as a steely-eyed
villain.
   But he recently finished his first role in comedy _ yes, comedy.
It's in a NBC movie for next season that the network says will
co-star Sherman Hemsley and be called ``Lights Out'' or ``Camp
Cucamonga.'''
   ``It's a comedy of mistaken identity,'' said Liddy, a former FBI
agent with a crisp, precise way of speaking. ``I play a summer camp
inspector ...''
   His TV series credits include ``Beans Baxter,'' ``MacGyver'' and
``Airwolf,'' and six TV or theatrical movies, including one called
``When Nature Calls.''
   Next month, he'll be seen as an archvillain named Satori in the
two-hour premiere of ``Super Force,'' a futuristic police series
syndicated to 160 stations. He doesn't know if he'll be a recurring
character in it.
   Liddy, whom Robert Conrad once played in an NBC movie about
Liddy's arrest, conviction and time in prison, made his acting
debut in 1985.
   He played Capt. Real Estate, an industrial-strength villain on
NBC's ``Miami Vice.'' He originally was to be killed, he said, but
the ending was ordered changed and he survived even the second
episode.
   Acting was not a quantum leap in a different direction, he said:
   ``You've got to remember, I once was a trial lawyer. I haven't
met a trial lawyer who was any good who wasn't also something of an
actor.''
   He speaks truth. Fred Thompson, former minority counsel for the
Senate Watergate committee, also now emotes, most recently in
``Days of Thunder'' and ``Die Hard 2.''
   Such is Hollywood that Liddy and Thompson even were on the same
side of the law as FBI agents in the recent movie, ``Feds.'' Did
they talk between scenes about old Watergate times?
   ``No, that's ancient history,'' said Liddy, who now is 59. ``And
we've all gone on to so many different things.''
   In his case, different things have included nightclub debates on
life and such with the likes of Timothy Leary, the ex-professor
with the acid wit, and Hunter S. Thompson, the only national
affairs analyst in America who doesn't appear on ``Washington Week
in Review.''
   This year, there was to be ``The Liddy Show,'' a syndicated
debate show. Alas, it didn't pan out. But there still is
Miami-based G. Gordon Liddy &amp; Associates, a private investigation
and guard company.
   Liddy also still lectures on security. His second novel,``The
Monkey Handlers,'' a new action-adventure novel, is due out in
October.
   And he soon will write a column about home-and-office security
as a contributing editor for Forbes' ``FYI,'' a new quarterly
magazine that will make its debut in September.
   Yes, it's his debut in journalism. He sardonically advises those
in that line of lunacy: ``I'm starting to break you guys' rice
bowl. You made a living off me for so long I figured, what the
hell...''
   Liddy, whose post-Watergate activities have yielded enough for
him to buy hia Maryland home facing the Potomac River and a winter
home in Arizona, is unrepentant, defiantly so, about the break-in
that made him famous.
   He has no regrets about the Watergate caper in which Nixon
repeatedly has denied any involvement.
   ``Let me put it this way,'' Liddy said. ``I did that for Nixon.
I had fun doing it. I'd do it again for (president) Bush if he
called.''
   __
   Elsewhere in television...
   NBC PUMPS TWICE: NBC has said it will ``double pump'' the
premiere episodes of six new series, or show them twice before the
new season officially starts on Sept. 17. Now, NBC is getting down
to cases.
   It says three pumpees, ``Hull High,'' ``Parenthood'' and
``Lifestories,'' will get their first showing on Aug. 20, then
again on different nights before their official premiere. ``Working
It Out'' will be pumped first on Aug. 22, ``Ferris Bueller'' on the
next night, and ``Law and Order'' on Sept. 13. Each also will have
another pre-premiere shot later on, ``Law and Order'' on Sept. 27
at 11:30 p.m. EDT. Three other newcomers, ``Fresh Prince of Bel
Air,'' ``American Dreamer'' and ``The Fanelli Boys'' get a
single-pump preview between Sept. 8 and Sept. 20.
   When will these series officially premiere? NBC, obviously
trying to keep the excitement going, says this will be announced
later.

<HEAD>Quayle's Latin American Trips Are Better Than Funeral Duty</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice presidents sometimes wind up on
funeral duty, but so far, Dan Quayle's specialty has been
presidential inaugurations _ openings, not endings.
   Maybe it reflects the generation gap.
   Quayle, 43, represented the United States on Tuesday at the
inauguration of Cesar Gaviria, 43, as president of Colombia. ``I am
here for his inauguration to show the strong importance that the
United States places on our continuing partnership with Colombia,''
Quayle said.
   Change the country and the theme can work most anywhere.
   In 18 months, Quayle has been at the inaugurations of six newly
elected leaders in Latin America. All of them won free elections,
on a continent once dotted with dictatorships. Most are youthful, a
new generation of Latin leadership.
   That prompted Quayle to remark in a Dallas speech that his Latin
American travels sometimes made him feel like an elder statesman.
   His still-sagging approval ratings in the public opinion polls
don't make him look like one at home.
   Quayle is returning to Washington tonight from Colombia, Peru,
Bolivia and Haiti, the stops on his seventh vice presidential trip
to Latin America and the Caribbean. Those travels have taken him to
17 Latin nations, among 29 he has visited as vice president.
   His inaugural contacts sometimes prove valuable. In Bogota, he
met again with President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, whose
second inauguration Quayle attended just after his own. They
crossed paths at two other inaugurals since.
   At the Venezuelan Embassy in Bogota, Perez told Quayle on
Tuesday that he would do everything he could with Venezuelan oil
and other OPEC producers to make up the shortfall left by the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   The emphasis on Central and South America wasn't designed for
Quayle; he was no specialist, and he does not speak Spanish. It
took shape trip by trip as events required high-level U.S.
representation. At a time of upheaval in eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, the president and the secretary of state were focused
elsewhere.
   They still are. Quayle left a U.S. capital gripped by the
Persian Gulf crisis, to fly to Bogota in a show of support for
Colombia's strong stand against the cocaine cartel and against drug
terrorists.
   And Bush had just postponed indefinitely a five-nation South
American trip of his own in mid-September. It was called off
because of budget deficit negotiations and other business at home.
   So Quayle has become the administration's point man in Latin
America. ``It's not a spectacular assignment, but it is a valuable
one for the administration,'' said his spokesman, David Beckwith.
   The low profile was evident when Quayle visited Bogota and spent
nearly three hours at an outdoor inauguration in a plaza by the
national Congress building. Before Bush went into Cartagena,
Colombia, under heavy military guard for the Feb. 15 drug summit at
an isolated naval base, he said he wasn't doing anything ``stupid
or macho.'' Quayle's appearance in Bogota obviously carried greater
risks, but nobody made much of it.
   He was there for about eight hours, touchdown to takeoff Tuesday
night, in a capital that has seen violence lthough drug terrorism
has centered elsewhere.
   The vice president's Latin American missions clearly have been a
plus, although it's not the kind of work likely to repair his
domestic political image. More people probably associate his
travels with the false story _ that he'd said he wished his
knowledge of Latin was better _ than with the favorable reviews he
has drawn, even from some Democrats.
   And it certainly beats funeral assignments. Quayle represented
the government at one, in Central America. As vice president, Bush
led U.S. delegations to the funerals of six foreign leaders, three
of them in Moscow.
   Bush made the count seem higher with periodic bits of funereal
humor.
   ``You die, we fly,'' he said.
   He also said that the funerals were useful. ``You do get to meet
firsthand these leaders and form a close personal relationship,''
he said at one dinner during his vice presidential days. ``Many of
these dead leaders have stayed in touch over the years.
   ``It's known as quiet diplomacy.''

<HEAD>A Recession Caused By The Fed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of words have been written and spoken
in praise of the Federal Reserve's determination to conquer
inflation and save the American economy from destruction.
   Those words are wasted on Richard Rahn. Though generally not
outspoken, economist Rahn has declared himself forcefully on the
subject, testifying before Congress that the central bank is
inflation's cause, not its cure.
   ``The central bank, and only the central bank, causes
inflation,'' he told Congress earlier this summer.
   Rahn commented then that governors of the Federal Reserve were
political appointees who acted secretly and without accountability
to anyone. He accused them of vagueness and even of misinformation.
   Now he accuses them of another economic crime, that of commiting
the economy to recession. While the recession might not have begun
yet, Rahn says it will be evident by the final quarter of this year
and the first of 1991.
   While some economists can be dismissed as publicity seekers _
being in the public eye is essential these days for an economist
seeking the big money _ Rahn must be listened to. He speaks for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   In his role as chief economist and vice president of that
organization, Rahn has watched as the Fed's tight money policy
squeezed small businesses, which the chamber has courted in recent
years.
   Some of those businesses that are being starved for credit,
supporters of Fed policy have argued, are speculative enterprises,
often in real estate or construction, that should be allowed to die.
   But other small companies are the opposite. They are innovative.
They have good products, markets and management. Today, their ideas
and products keep the big companies alert. Tomorrow, they are
themselves big companies.
   Many of these young companies also are being denied credit, in
part at least because of tight Fed policies.
   The Fed, he said, has left no margin for error in aggressively
pursuing its goal of inflation control, mistakenly assuming that
economic growth somehow produces inflation, when the real reasons
lie elsewhere.
   Rahn explained his thesis in his congressional testimony, during
which he stated that the nation has a fiat money system controlled
by government and outside the control of the rule of law.
   Government, he said, retains monopoly control of money simply by
spending it _ and then compelling the Fed to accommodate the
spending by manipulating the money supply to keep that spending
from creating inflation.
   The Fed does this, in part, by cracking down on the economy and
limiting its ability to grow, the rationale being that
private-sector growth atop the already heavy burden of government
spending might strain economic capacity.
   In Rahn's view, the effort is futile. He said ``as long as the
government maintains a monopoly over money and relies on an
unaccountable, government central bank to manage that monoply,
inflation will persist.''
   In an effort to accommodate government and its spending
proclivities, he said, the Fed ``whipsaws the economy between
inflation and recession,'' rather than pursuing a long-term policy
consistent with stable economic growth.
   In the first instance, inflation, the Fed enlarges the money
supply to avert inflation. In the second, Rahn suggests, it
overreacts to its own policy and cracks down with tight credit,
putting the economy into a tailspin.
   Get government spending in line, and open up the Fed's
activities to greater scrutiny, says Rahn. Require that Fed policy
be set and implemented in public.
   And if recession does come, as he forecasts, don't swallow the
explanation that it was caused by Iraqi adventurism in the Middle
East. Blame it on bad economic policy, he says.

<HEAD>Mideast Turmoil Lifts Oil, Gold Funds; But Experts Say Sit Tight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has bruised stock and
bond prices, raised most interest rates, and renewed fears of both
a recession and higher inflation from a possibly explosive rise in
oil prices.
   What should the average investor do?
   ``Sit tight and see what happens in a few days. The time to make
decisions is when the markets are quiet, not when they're crazy,''
says Jay Goldinger, an investment counselor and principal of
Capital Insight Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Many other financial planners and strategists are saying the
same thing to clients _ apparently over and over again _ as they
report a steady rise in customer calls.
   So far, most individual investors seem to be heeding that advice.
   Although the stock and bond markets have fallen sharply since
the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, mutual fund managers say
that haven't seen a mass exodus of money from their funds, which
move in tandem with the markets. Some are even reporting buying
interest among a few bargain-hunting investors.
   Not surprisingly, fund managers say interest has been
particularly acute in the 52 inflation-pegged gold and natural
resources stock funds traded in the United States, as their rates
of return rise with the tensions in the Persian Gulf. But some
experts caution investors against shifting their money there.
   ``It may be a little late,'' said Michael Lipper, president of
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in New York, which regularly tracks
mutual funds.
   Lipper said only the most nimble of investors who are betting
that oil prices will continue to increase might want to consider
moving in, then quickly cashing out.
   ``But if that's their approach, I don't think funds are the
right way for them to go,'' he said, noting that most fund
investors are usually in it for the long haul.
   The Iraqi-Kuwait conflict has pushed up crude oil prices by more
than 25 percent to levels not seen since the mid-1980s. That, in
turn, helped depress stock and bond prices and pushed up interest
rates as the markets worried about rising inflation and a recession.
   During the week of the invasion, natural resource funds, most of
which are oil based, had a 3.19 percent rise in the average rate of
return, while gold-related funds were up on average 3.89 percent,
according to Lipper. At the same time, general equity funds were
down 2.04 percent, he said.
   Fidelity Investments in Boston said its four main gold- or
energy-related funds remain standouts among its more than 180
funds, with rates of return between nearly 4 percent to nearly 6
percent higher in just one week.
   David McLaughlin, a financial adviser with Chase Investment
Counsel in Charlottesville, Va., said investors considering buying
into these funds, as well as related individual stocks, should do
so as a hedge against inflation, not as a change in strategy.
   Even then, he advises: ``Don't buy your whole position all at
once. Buy a little bit now and wait and see.''
   McLaughlin said now may be the time to pick up some high-quality
stocks of companies that can withstand economic changes. Consumer
products and media stocks, for example, would fit that category.
   Goldinger recommends that those with extra cash consider
Treasury bills and notes with maturities of two years of less.
Because money is locked in for a shorter time these securities are
less susceptible to higher inflation and market volatility.
   These days short-term securities are offering rates that are
highly competitive to those of longer-term bonds, which earlier
this week sustained their biggest selloff in nearly three years.
   The yield on the two-year Treasury note, for instance, stood at
7.98 percent on Wednesday, while the 30-year bond yielded 8.81
percent.
   Bank certificates of deposit and money market accounts also
offer similar short-term protection. But banks have been lowering
CD and money market rates, according the most recent random check
by the North Palm Beach, Fla., publication Bank Rate Monitor.

   Stay out of the music scene for four years
and look what happens.
   British soul stylist Paul Young can tell you all about it. After
his third album, ``Between Two Fires,'' ran its course in 1986, he
slowed down to start a family. He then took two more years to put
together his latest album, ``Other Voices.''
   While he was gone, the Motown sound returned to the charts with
blue-eyed soul singers and fellow Brits at the helm: George
Michael, Simply Red and Lisa Stansfield. Young returned just in
time.
   ``People could say I've been away long enough to be forgotten,''
he said in an interview. ``In some territories, it is long enough
to be forgotten, but in other territories, it's been a break, and
that's not such a bad thing.''
   Young began ``Other Voices'' with the same staff he had used on
his three previous albums, but was unsatisfied with the results.
Six months' work, as he said, went ``down the pan.''
   So he started anew. He brought in plenty of guest musicians _
Pink Floyd's David Gilmour on guitar, singer Chaka Khan on backing
vocals and Stevie Wonder on harmonica. Nile Rodgers produced a
track, and two more were done with former J. Geils Band leader
Peter Wolf.
   But Young still felt he had to get back to his roots in Britain
and did some recording there as well.
   ``Working with Peter, I was coming up with music that was very
different from what I'd done before, much more American,'' he said.
``My biggest audience is in Europe and I can't ignore that.''
   ``Other Voices'' is filled with material by other artists,
including covers of the Chi-Lites' ``Oh Girl'' and Free's ``A
Little Bit of Love.'' Young sees doing these songs as a way of
distancing himself from his own material.
   ``I'd like to forget that I wrote them and approach them as an
arranger and then I could probably enjoy it more,'' he said. ``But
underneath it, there's always my song and so I see it one
particular way. That somehow stops me from doing certain things.
   ``With other songs, I've heard them one way, I see them another
way, so straightaway, I've got this choice of things I can do with
it and I think that makes it more enjoyable.''
   He also sees doing covers as a way to keep great old songs
alive, but likes to look for the less well-known standards.
   ``I tend to prefer finding songs that are little gems in the
dust, as it were, and making them out to be something special,
because maybe they (the audience) missed it the first time
'round,'' he said.
   ``I don't like a lot of music that loses track of its roots. I
hope that what I'm doing when I do these things is keeping the old
stuff in their minds, but keeping up to date in terms of how I work
the arrangements, what instruments I use, stuff like that.''
   On ``Other Voices,'' Young said he went back to ``playing a lot
of stuff live again and not using too much machinery. I think the
trick is to use the machinery but still make it sound very human.''
   Songwriting is not his forte, he said, but he's looking to
change that.
   ``I think I was working with a guy who also found it very hard
to be a songwriter and that made it even more difficult,'' he said.
``So now I've made some contacts with people who actually enjoy the
process of being stuck in a room for eight hours, which I don't
find in the least bit inviting.''
   Young's solo career began in 1982 after 3{ years with the soul
outfit the Q-Tips. His first break came in 1983 with a version of
the Marvin Gaye classic, ``Wherever I Lay My Hat,'' which stayed at
No. 1 in England for three weeks. His debut album, ``No Parlez,''
also reached the top of the charts there.
   His long-awaited U.S. success came with the Top 20 song, ``Come
Back and Stay,'' also from ``No Parlez.'' But his second album,
``The Secret of Association,'' released in 1985, contained his
first U.S. No. 1 hit _ ``Everytime You Go Away,'' written by Daryl
Hall of Hall and Oates.
   He doesn't necessarily see ``Other Voices'' as a progression,
but rather a beginning of new things.
   ``I think I've now built myself another little base to work
from,'' he said. ``It's a pretty good mixture of what the last
three albums had done and it's now on one album. There's quite a
few indications of ways I could go.''

   Southern Baptist moderates have called a national
meeting Aug 23-25 to consider what to do about the fundamentalist
wing gaining full-scale control of the denomination.
   The gathering in Atlanta was called to explore ways to uphold
principles that differ with the new fundamentalist directions and
to consider alternate means for channeling giving to missions.
   ``I think we are ripe for God to use us in creating something
new and visionary and historic,'' said the Rev. Daniel Vestal of
Dunwoody, Ga., the moderates' defeated candidate in June for the
denominational presidency.
   That victory by fundamentalists for the 12th year in a row
completed their gradual solidifying of control over agencies of the
14.9-million-member denomination.
   A Houston-based moderate organization, Baptists Committed, and
Dunwoody called the Atlanta meeting as a growing number of
congregations across the country planned limits on giving to the
denomination's cooperative budget.
   Moderate discontent was intensified by the recent firing of the
top editors of the denomination's news agency, Baptist Press.
Indicating moderates have given up regaining influence over the
denomination, Vestal said they don't plan to enter a presidential
candidate in 1991.

   A United Methodist missionary from embattled
Liberia voiced dismay that the United States failed to send in
troops to prevent the massacre in St. Peter's Lutheran Church in
Monrovia, Liberia's capital.
   ``With 10 Marines, they could have guarded this church,'' the
Rev. William Warnock said of the slaughter July 30 by Liberian
government troops. As many as 600 adults and children were killed,
reports said.
   Referring to the conflict there between rebels and the Liberian
regime, from which U.S. Marines later brought out some Americans,
Warnock added, ``Both sides respect the U.S. government and the
Marines.''
   He said the Lutheran church and Nagbe United Methodist Church
across the street were among centers giving sanctuary to civilian
refugees from the fighting under auspices of the International Red
Cross.

   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati said three
delegations will fan out to various parts of Eastern and Central
Europe to ascertain needs and coordinate aid efforts.
   ``These delegations represent the first major step in what the
bishops envision as a substantial program of aid by American
Catholics to the long-suffering church in those countries.
   ``Equally important, the delegations will be a key part of a
process of renewing and deepening bonds of solidarity ... bonds
that had been broken or severely weakened in the past decades due
to government interference.''
   One deligation, led by Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los

<HEAD>Clear Purpose Counts More Than Money in Bettering Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More money, often singled out as the key to
improving schools, apparently in itself doesn't do the job.
   That's the conclusion of two different recent studies, one
secular, the other religious. They say cohesive purpose, less
centralized bureacracy and parental choice are what count.
   ``When it comes to education, money is not the panacea many
politicians and educators would have us believe,'' says Brother
Robert Kealey, chief researcher for a study by the National
Catholic Educational Association.
   ``Placing more trust in teachers and parents is the key.''
   This also is the general thrust of a recent study by the
Brookings Institution of Washington, D.C., in calling for a
reformed system open to parental choice of schools and competition
among them.
   ``Money is not what makes some schools more effective than
others,'' says the study, contending that reduced bureaucratic
constraints and more freedom in decision-making about instruction
and discipline are what gets better results.
   The book-long study, ``Politics, Markets and America's
Schools,'' by John Chubb, a Brookings fellow, and Terry Moe, a
Stanford University political scientist, says the U.S. education
system is hobbled by topheavy regulations.
   ``Private schools _ which outperform public schools, on the
average _ also tend to spend less than the public schools do in
educating their students,'' the study says. ``They get better
schools for less money.''
   That _ with figures to back it up _ also is the contention of a
study by the NCEA, which compares consolidated financial figures
from U.S. Catholic elementary schools and from the National Center
for Education Statistics.
   They show that the Catholic schools spent $1.476 per pupil in
1988-89, less than one half the $3,977 per-pupil cost for public
school students in the 1986-87 academic year, the latest overall
statistics available.
   ``The econmomies in the Catholic school network are related most
directly to the leadership responsibility placed in the hands of
Catholic school principals and teachers,'' says Sister Catherine T.
McNamee, NCEA president.
   ``Their empowerment _ and their success _ precludes the need for
high administrative costs.''
   Previous studies have found that Catholic school students
outperform their public school counterparts in reading, mathematics
and science tests.
   The costs comparisons were based on data from 907 Catholic
schools representing more than 12 percent of all U.S. Catholic
elementary schools and from national composites on public schools.
   Kealey, executive director of the NCEA's elementary and
secondary school department, said the findings correspond with
those of the Brookings Institution _ that greater expenditures
don't insure more effectiveness.
   The NCEA, noting that Catholic parents pay school taxes just as
do parents of students in public schools, advocates tax credits to
parents that would foster choice and competition among schools,
   ``The competitive spirit will engender excellence and initiative
_ keys to educational success,'' Sister McNamee says.
   The Brookings study recommends a similar approach to financing
in the form of scholarships.
   It says the present public system is ``fundamentally flawed,''
that ``America's children are not learning enough, they are not
learning the right things, and most debilitating of all, they are
not learning how to learn.''
   The study says private schools tend to be more effective because
they are not burdened by the bureaucracy and politics surrounding
U.S. public schools and their greater responsibility for decisions
makes for clearer purpose.
   ``The more school decision-making is constrained to
superintendents, district offices, unions and the rules and
regulations they promulgate, the less effective the school
organization is likely to be,'' the study says.
   ``Extensive, top-down control of schools is simply inconsistent
with the development at the school site of leadership and teacher
professionalism.''
   The Catholic report says the present average tuition costs in
Catholic schools is $924 annually, with the difference between that
and per pupil expenditure of $1,476 coming from parish or diocesan
subsidies.
   Sister McNamee says parents of Catholic elementary students last
year provided ``a financial gift to the nation of almost $8
billion'' _ the costs of 7,500 schools in which about 2 million
students were enrolled.
   The study notes the Catholic schools are seeking added sources
of income, such as endowment or development funds, and need to
improve salaries and benefits for teachers.
   Catholic school teachers make an average $16,000 annually while
public school teachers make about $27,000, the study says. It says
public elementary school principals make about $44,000 while
Catholic school princiapls average about $26,000.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disagreement by the two sides
over whether to kick dozens of allegedly corrupt officers out of
the army could push El Salvador into another round of civil war.
   On July 26, government and rebel negotiators ended a third
session of monthly U.N.-mediated peace talks with an accord on
human rights. They are to meet again Friday in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   July's agreements skirted armed forces reform, the main item on
the peace agenda and the key to ending a decade-long war that has
killed an estimated 72,000 people, most of them civilians.
   Salvadorans, barely recovered from the bloody rebel offensive of
November 1989, are waiting for the other shoe, a combat boot they
expect will crash down in the next few weeks.
   Leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
known as the FMLN, have warned of another major attack unless the
government agrees to steps toward ``demilitarization.''
   Acrimonious debate of the military's role has occupied more than
90 percent of the negotiating time and produced only cosmetic
changes in positions, with no agreement. Each side accuses the
other of intransigence.
   The army has been on alert since early July. Soldiers with
assault rifles are everywhere on downtown and suburban streets,
patrolling or manning roadblocks.
   Forced recruitment of young men has increased. Soldiers
routinely stop intercity buses to induct those who cannot prove
they have served already.
   Last month, citizens frightened by rumors of an imminent
guerrilla offensive stocked up on beans, a staple of the Salvadoran
diet, driving up the price.
   Seven points are on the peace agenda, but both sides agree the
only really sticky one is what to do about the army.
   El Salvador has held periodic elections since 1982 and tried to
consolidate some democratic institutions, but the military retains
tremendous influence.
   The main obstacle to an armistice that would disband the FMLN is
the dispute over the rebels' insistence that the high command be
purged of officers they accuse of corruption and abusing human
rights. The government and armed forces say that would amount to
interference with the military.
   Oscar Santamaria, the chief government negotiator, said in an
interview: ``The FMLN position appears designed to cripple the
armed forces rather than to change or reform them,''
   President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government has proposed
letting the armed forces police themselves. The rebels say history
shows the army cannot be trusted to do that.
   Despite evidence implicating the military in torture,
disappearances and thousands of murders, no officer has been
convicted of a crime involving the politically motivated abuse of
human rights.
   ``They are saying, `Trust us. We're going to be good from now
on,''' said Schafik Handal, a guerrilla commander and the chief
rebel negotiator. ``If we lay down our arms before agreeing on a
purge and an end to military impunity, there would be another
bloodbath like that of the early 1980s.''
   Guerrilla demands for a purge and a drastic reduction in the
army's numerical strength have struck a chord in a people who
traditionally view the army with a mixture of fear and contempt.
   ``Chafarote,'' the popular term for soldier, is a combination of
words meaning falseness and filth.
   ``I don't like the guerrillas, but I completely agree with their
demand for a purge and demilitarization,'' said the owner of a tile
factory. ``The military has been a scourge for this country.''
   As often happens in this violent nation, he asked that his name
not be used.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who follows
Central American affairs closely, said in July that 40 to 50
Salvadoran officers should be retired early or otherwise removed.
   Guerrilla spokesmen talk of purging 200 officers, but that is
seen as a negotiating figure subject to change. The rebels demand
only removal, not trials and punishment.
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, a brigade commander and member of the
government negotiating team, agreed that the military could benefit
from a change in its upper echelons, but said the process must be
gradual and internal.
   He said in an interview that about 10 top officers could be
removed in the next year, but that a more drastic housecleaning
would irreparably damage the command structure.
   The United States provides about $1 million a day in economic
and military aid to El Salvador. Earlier this year, the State
Department and U.S. Embassy appeared to be seeking some sort of
military shakeup, but recent comments indicate Washington has eased
the pressure.

<TEXT>
   Citizens of Tver and dozens of other
Soviet cities are casting off the names and symbols of a painful
past.
   The people of this ancient city 100 miles northwest of Moscow
started by taking back the name it bore for centuries before Stalin
called it Kalinin, for a henchman born near Tver.
   To Catherine the Great, the city was ``the most beautiful in the
empire'' after St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, because of its 18th
century architecture. As the namesake of Mikhail Kalinin, it became
a reminder of repression and death.
   Gorky Street in Moscow, the capital's main thoroughfare, has
been changed back to Tverskaya Street. Fashionable shops and stores
lined the street before the Bolshevik revolution, and outside the
city it became the main road to Tver.
   On July 19, the front page of Kalininskaya Pravda, the local
newspaper, carried a decree signed by Boris N. Yeltsin, president
of the Russian republic. It said the republic's Presidium
``decrees: Rename the city Kalinin to the city Tver.''
   Yeltsin had reversed half a century and fulfilled a dream of
many residents.
   A poem published with the decree said: ``Well, goodbye Kalinin.
You were just a pseudonym of our returning Tver.''
   Now, even the newspaper will have to call itself something else.
   The name game is sweeping this vast country. For decades,
cities, streets, ships, farms and factories were renamed for
Bolshevik heroes and officials.
   Then, as political times changed under Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
history was rewritten, some of the officials were disgraced and the
circle was completed.
   Naberezhni Chelny, renamed Brezhnev, was returned to its
original name. Tsaritsyn, renamed Stalingrad, became Volgograd.
   Other name changes actual or likely include the emergence of old
Samara from Kuibyshev, Nizhny Novgorod from Gorky; transformation
of Kirov to Vzyatka, Sverdlovsk to old Ekaterinburg, Andropov to
Rybinsk; the rescue of Marnupol from Zhdanov, Lugansk from
Voroshilovgrad and Vladikavkaz from Ordzhonikidze.
   Some people who are fed up with the old order even want to
change Leningrad back to St. Petersburg.
   The name of Mikhail Kalinin, the Soviet president in 1938-1946,
was attached to many places other than Tver, which became Kalinin
on his birthday in 1931.
   Koenigsberg, a historic German city incorporated into the Soviet
Union at the end of World War II, became Kaliningrad. Major streets
in other Soviet cities, including Moscow, honor Kalinin.
   He was a figurehead president hated by victims of the
collectivization of agriculture, a dark period in the country's
history.
   Millions of people were arrested and executed as ``enemies of
the people''' during the collectivization of the 1930s, including
many from Kalinin's home region. Some of the bodies are believed to
have been dumped into mass, unmarked graves near Tver.
   The campaign to regain Kalinin's old name began in the 1960s,
but did not get far until Gorbachev and glasnost came along. Eleven
engineers and intellectuals founded a group called Return in March
1988 with that as its goal.
   Boris Yershov, a leader of the group and a local legislator,
said Return's members were described at first as ``extremists,
sometimes as hooligans.''
   People asked, ```How could you insult the memory of Mikhail
Kalinin, a leading figure in the party, government and society?'''
Yershov said.
   ``When we said he wasn't a leading figure of the party and the
government, people just didn't believe us. People were so fooled by
the propaganda ... for years, for decades, about our leaders, they
just didn't accept our words.''
   Support for Return gradually increased, Yershov said, and people
began asking: ``If Kalinin is not the person he's made out to be,
why do we bear his name? Why such a supreme honor to a person who
promoted Stalin's crimes?''
   More than 14,000 of the city's 475,000 people signed a petition
last year demanding it be called Tver again. Local party and
legislative bodies eventually gave their support and the idea was
ratified by Yeltsin, a radical reformer elected president of
Russia, the country's largest republic, in June.
   Residents interviewed the day Yeltsin's decree was published
said the move was welcome but they also wanted other changes.
   ``I'm not in a festive mood,'' said Natalya Drozdenko, a woman
in her mid-30s waiting in a long line to buy chickens.
   ``It's only right to change the name and we have been struggling
for it, lending our signatures to petitions, etcetera, but somehow
I understand it's only symbolic and it won't affect our
well-being.''
   Alexander Bartyenyev, an 84-year-old World War II veteran
strolling past the shops, remembers when the city was still called
Tver and said Mikhail Kalinin never deserved the honor.
   ``Kalinin was treated as one of our own,'' Bartyenyev said. ``He
was born here and worked here, but as president of the country, he
could not stop the blood-letting.''
   Yershov said his organization now would turn its attention to
restoring monuments, churches and the old street names.

<HEAD>Infiniti M30: Capable but Unpretentious Hybrid</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Infiniti. The name connotes luxury, distinctive ride, smooth,
impressive power.
   Indeed, the Infiniti division flagship, the Q45 luxury sedan,
provides all that and more.
   The 1990 Infiniti M30 two-door coupe _ the littler sibling _ is
different, however.
   This makeover of the rear-drive Nissan Leopard, a model that
Nissan has sold in Japan since the 1987 model year, is a hybrid
composed of an admirable suspension system, an adequate powerplant,
and a rather non-distinctive exterior.
   The result is a capable but unpretentious car that may be
proving difficult for consumers to differentiate in the market _
even with the Infiniti badge it carries.
   The best part of the M30 is its handling on twisting country
roads. A unique sonar device mounted under the radiator senses the
coming contours of the pavement, plugs that data into an electronic
brain that monitors speed, body sway and other factors, and quickly
adjusts the car's suspension to give the driver maximum control.
   The driver also can select, from a button on the center console
inside the car, whether to drive in ``sport'' or ``comfort'' mode.
The ``comfort'' setting had a tad mushier feel than the ``sport''
mode but helped cushion road bumps. The M30 features MacPherson
struts in the front and semi-trailing suspension arms in the back.
Stabilizer bars are at both front and back of the car to aid
cornering.
   The 3-liter V-6 is similar to the powerplant in Nissan's Maxima
and can deliver 162 horsepower at 5,200 rpm. With four-speed
automatic transmission, it moves the 3,300-pound M30 from 0-60 mph
in 9.7 seconds.
   Compared with the refined yet exciting 278-horsepower of the
Q45, where the car's tires never screeched, the M30 would pull
aggressively as it went through the shift points during fast
accelerations. And the large tires _ Dunlop P215-60HR15 sport
all-season radials _ squealed a couple times as they worked to grab
the road.
   Outside, the Infiniti M30 looked similar to a Honda and had
minimal chrome. Even the Infiniti logo lacked the lacy, ornate
design of the Q45 badge.
   Still, the car was well appointed. Leather interior, power
windows, power door locks, sunroof, anti-theft system, air
conditioning and antilock brakes are standard.
   The M30 trunk was a roomy 11.6 cubic feet, though you have to
lift items up and over the car body.
   Rear seating was OK for two adults, with the front seats pushed
up a ways. My knees were shoved into the netted map holders on the
backs of the front seats when those seats were pushed back all the
way. I had to slouch if I sat in the middle of the rear seat to
keep my head from hitting the roof, and there I also had to contend
with the rear-drive hump in the middle of the rear floor.
   The M30 fit and finish was good, save for a small, plastic cover
that fell off the metal lever that activated the driver's power
seat.
   The Bose sound system included dual radio controls: one located
on the radio at the center of the dashboard and a second set on the
dash behind the steering wheel for an easier reach for the driver.
   Infiniti spokeswoman Laura Fox said competitors include BMWs and
Mercedes autos. The M30's $23,500 base price compares with a
$24,650 base price for the BMW 325 two-door and a $31,600 price for
the lowest-priced Mercedes.
   Early buyers of the M30 average 44 years of age, with household
income of $96,000. Fifty-seven percent were men, Fox said, adding
that most are married and are college educated.
   To bolster overall Infiniti division sales, the Q45 and M30 will
be joined this fall by a new Infiniti, the G20 sedan, which is to
be priced under $20,000.
   Because the M30 is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazine does
not list owner complaints.

<HEAD>California's Big Green Triggers Flashing Red Lights Among Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics of the so-called Big Green initiative
that Californians will vote on this fall say its restrictions on
agricultural chemicals probably would mean the end of civilization.
   That is an exaggeration, of course. But there is alarm among
some farm groups, chemical companies and consumer watchers. And
it's not just in California, says an Agriculture Department report.
   If Big Green is approved, it would ban the use of chemicals that
are suspected of causing cancer or birth defects.
   Overall, some estimates indicate 70 percent of the pesticides
now used in California would be banned within two to eight years.
   Shannon Reid Hamm of the department's Economic Research Service
said fruit and vegetable farmers ``may be left out in the cold if
the initiative becomes law.''
   Chemical manufacturers, faced with high costs of research and
development, would be less inclined to develop new chemical
alternatives for one state _ even when that state is California
with its giant share of the fruit and vegetable market.
   ``California is the major supplier of fruits and vegetables to
the United States and, in some cases, the world,'' she said in the
August issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   Last year, she said, California accounted for $8.5 billion, or
41 percent of the nation's farm sales of fruit, nuts and vegetables.
   During the 1980s, Hamm said, California had four consecutive
years of below-normal rainfall, soaring land prices and reforms in
labor laws.
   ``Alone, any one of these events would have strained local
growers,'' she said. ``Yet these changes may not reshape the
industry as much as the Big Green initiative.''
   The initiative _ formally, the California Environmental
Protection Act _ also has provisions for ozone depletion, offshore
oil drilling and oil spills, and air pollution.
   A coalition of local farm groups, retailers and distributors
called Californians for Responsible Food Laws, or CAREFUL, proposed
a counter initiative called the Consumer Pesticide Act of 1990.
   This initiative was designed to address only those parts of Big
Green dealing with food and farm worker safety, Hamm said. If both
initiatives pass, the one with the most votes will supersede the
provisions in the other that deal with food and worker safety.
   Hamm said there has been much public speculation about the
physical and economic impact of Big Green but that estimates vary
greatly.
   One USDA researcher has estimated that a ban on fungicides and
insecticides on lettuce and tomatoes would cut yields 50 percent to
60 percent and boost consumer prices.
   Others believe that output of several important fruits and
vegetables would drop about 28 percent and that prices would rise
50 percent, she said.
   But these estimates ``come from economic models and industry
consensus rather than historical evidence,'' Hamm said.
   ``Whether Big Green or the CAREFUL initiative passes on Nov. 6,
chemical availability probably will decline in the 1990s,'' she
said. ``Initially, fruit and vegetable growers likely will face
higher production costs and consumers will see higher prices, lower
quality and tighter supplies as chemicals are removed from use in
California.''
   The higher prices will encourage production in other states and
foreign countries, Hamm said.
   Other countries are watching the situation, and the Bush
administration is concerned that California going its own way with
Big Green could have world trade repercussions.
   Trade Representative Carla Hills has asked the U.S.
International Trade Commission to investigate the potential impact
of Big Green on world trade. An interim report is due by Sept. 31.
   Hills has said Big Green standards would be tougher than federal
rules and thus create potential conflict.
   Also, she said in her May 8 letter to the commission, adoption
of the initiative ``could seriously affect any new U.S. trade
obligations'' that may result from current talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation said if each state enacted
its own pesticide regulations, the lack of uniformity would
severely hamper U.S. agriculture production and trade.
   Paul Drazek, the federation's trade specialist, said the
California measure would make the United States less competitive
and would run counter to GATT efforts for a uniform set of
international agricultural health standards based on scientific
evidence.
   Supporters of Big Green, such as the Natural Resources Defense
Council, contend that the initiative would have only marginal
effect on U.S. trade because chemicals would be phased out over a
long period of time and that alternatives would be found.

<HEAD>Advertising Recession Greets New Chairman at Media General</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``for sale'' sign is hanging at J.
Stewart Bryan III's newspapers, but media-hungry investors
shouldn't get excited _ the deal is for advertising space, not the
papers themselves.
   ``There are plenty of enticing offers, but they're not for
sale,'' Bryan, newly installed as chairman of Media General Inc.,
said of the company's daily newspapers here and in Winston-Salem,
N.C., and Tampa, Fla.
   Two years ago, Burt Sugarman, a California-based television game
show producer, tried to parlay control of about 10 percent of Media
General stock into three seats on the board of directors. But the
effort failed because a two-tiered stock plan gave the Bryan family
the upper hand in shareholder voting power.
   Sugarman eventually gave up his holdings for $44 million and a
newsprint recycling mill valued at $56 million, which he sold a
year later for $95 million.
   Bryan, 52, said he didn't begrudge Sugarman the profit. ``We
think we made a good deal and we're happy with it,'' he said.
   But the Sugarman episode taught Bryan ``what a waste of company
resources it is to spend money and time to fend off raiders when
you ought to be spending your time trying to maximize shareholder
value,'' he said.
   These days, tending to the needs of shareholders means coping
with a sluggish advertising market.
   On July 1, Bryan succeeded his father, D. Tennant Bryan, as
chairman and replaced James S. Evans as president and chief
executive officer.
   The younger Bryan, a director of The Associated Press, is the
fourth generation of his family to run the city's newspapers. His
father, now 84, succeeded Bryan's grandfather as publisher in 1944,
then founded Media General in 1969 and steered the company to a
tenfold increase in assets over 20 years.
   During the senior Bryan's final quarter as chairman, the company
posted $12.4 million in earnings, or 48 cents a share, more than
double the $6.1 million, or 23 cents a share, in the second quarter
of 1989.
   But Stewart Bryan said advertising, a key element in newspaper
profits, is still ``troublesome'' for Media General's Richmond
Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader, the Winston-Salem
Journal and the Tampa Tribune.
   ``You set goals all the time, but they're very hard to keep when
you're in a recession, in an advertising recession, which is
certainly what all media companies with very few exceptions are in
right now,'' Bryan said. ``Times are tough.''
   Bankruptcies and consolidations in the retail industry are a
large part of the problem, he said.
   Three years ago, the Miller &amp; Rhoads department store chain was
the leading advertiser in the Richmond papers, Bryan said. ``And
now Miller &amp; Rhoads is no more.''
   The chain filed for bankruptcy late last year. Although some
Miller &amp; Rhoads stores were sold to other chains, its flagship
downtown store just two blocks from Media General's headquarters
remains vacant.
   Media General's restructuring has meant selling much of its
newsprint interests as well as the California papers. Last year,
the company's revenues fell to $606 million from $756 million in
1988, largely because of divested assets. Operating profits of $65
million in 1989 were down 34 percent from $98 million a year
earlier.
   What remains of Media General, in addition to the daily
newspapers, are three television stations in Jacksonville and
Tampa, Fla., and Charleston, S.C.; two cable television companies
in Fairfax County and Fredericksburg, Va.; a 40 percent stake in
New Jersey-based Garden State Newspapers, a chain of weeklies; plus
a few smaller holdings.
   ``Instead of expanding, we are trying to get back to the core
businesses that have been the basis for whatever success we have
enjoyed over the years,'' Bryan said.
   Bryan came up through the business, working in circulation and
editorial posts before becoming publisher of the Tribune Co. in
Tampa. He subsequently became publisher of the Richmond papers and
was named a director of Media General in 1974.
   ``He caught on real quick,'' said Tennant Bryan. ``It was time
for me to go and time for him to take over. I think he has earned
the high regard of his colleagues and his contemporaries in the
press.''
   ``I was never brought up to think I'd be running this company,''
Stewart Bryan said. ``I guess I began to think it might be a
possibility in the last five years or so.''
   Bryan, father of two daughters, said he has had little time
recently for his hobbies of tennis, fishing and duck hunting.
   Taking over the top job ``feels pretty much the same as before,
just a little less free time, a little more mail, a little more
work to do, I suppose,'' he said. ``This is not any radical change.
The same people are here.''
   Bryan's father stayed on as chairman of the board of directors'
executive committee, and Evans, who had been president since 1982
and CEO since 1985, moved to vice chairman.
   ``We try to seek a consensus on what it is we're doing or
considering doing, and I think it will remain that way,'' Bryan
said.
   Industry analysts see the company's shift in management as a
good sign.
   ``Frankly, I think having a younger guy at the helm is a
positive step for this company,'' said Peter Appert, a stock
analyst with C.J. Lawrence in New York.
   The company's stock has sunk from about $42 per share in May
1988, when Sugarman made his foray, to about $25.
   In recent months, the stock has attracted the interest of New
York money manager Mario J. Gabelli, who has raised his stake in
Media General stock to about 17 percent. Gabelli did not return
calls for comment.
   Bryan said he was not worried that Gabelli's holdings might be
used in a power play similar to the Sugarman raid. ``His investment
in us is really quite small when you look at it in terms of his
total pot that he's got to invest somewhere,'' Bryan said.

   Persian Gulf war rumors raced through the
financial world, pushing oil prices toward $29 a barrel and sending
more jolts through markets for U.S. stocks and bonds.
   Increasing indications of a possible Iraq-U.S. showdown in the
vital oil-producing region transfixed professional investors and
speculators through most of the day Tuesday and made many markets
seesaw without warning.
   Each suggestion of a conflict sent oil prices higher and stocks
and bonds lower on the theory that a fresh blanket of oil-shock
inflation would wallop the already weak U.S. economy. Conversely,
rumors that the situation was easing weakened oil prices and sent
money back into the stock and bond markets.

   Some magazine readers are thumbing their noses
at ``scent strips,'' the fragrance advertising inserts that can
make everything in the mailbox smell like a perfume store.
   These people want scent strips sealed in odor-proof wrappers to
protect the health of the allergic, asthmatic and hypersensitive,
as well as the olfactory sensibilities of everyone else.
   Legislation to regulate the use of the strips is even being
considered in some states.
   Manufacturers and publishers defend the strips as an
inexpensive, effective way to bring fragrances from the perfume
counter to the kitchen counter. But some have agreed to stop using
one form of the strips.
   The scent strip was first used widely in the early 1980s to
introduce a perfume called Giorgio, whose manufacturers could not
afford the usual television advertising and promotional giveaways.
   Women were able to sample the powerful perfume at their leisure,
and anyone else not directly upwind also got a blast. Giorgio
became America's best selling fragrance.
   Billions of fragrance inserts have been distributed over the
past decade, and about 30 major magazines regularly carry them. The
magazines love the ad revenue _ $15 million last year _ but some
readers don't like the scents.
   One is Amy Solomon, 38, who opened a fashion magazine last
spring on a train ride from Manhattan to Albany.
   By Beacon, she had a headache. By Poughkeepsie, she could barely
open her eyes. By Hudson, she felt sick to her stomach.
   ``There ought to be a law,'' she told herself. As director of
communications for New York state Sen. Martin Connor, she was in a
position to help pass one.
   At Solomon's urging, Connor is sponsoring a bill to prevent
distribution of cosmetic or fragrance samples unless they are
``enclosed in a sealant,'' such as a plastic or foil wrapper.
   Legislators in New Jersey and Massachusetts also are preparing
bills. Several magazines are refusing strip ads, and New York
magazine subscribers can request a strip-free copy.
   A scent strip is a coating, usually containing hundreds of
thousands of microscopic capsules of fragrance oil, that has been
slathered under the overflap of an ad page.
   In theory, the capsules are broken and their aroma released only
when the overlap is peeled back; in reality, capsules often break
prematurely in shipping and handling.
   But the worst culprit is something called ``free oil.''
   By the late '80s, thick fashion magazines had become a riot of
competing fragrances. In an attempt to grab readers by the nose,
some companies began dousing their inserts with unencapsulated
fragrance oil that soaks into the paper whether or not the flap is
pulled back.
   Such magazines mingle with other mail, and even Soldier of
Fortune could wind up smelling more like a boutique than a rifle
range. Carolyn Wright, a letter carrier from Ravena, N.Y., says she
gets a headache the day Cosmopolitan is delivered.
   Last month California barred free oil inserts.
   In an attempt to head off more restrictive laws, the leading
makers of fragrance inserts agreed to stop using free oil on July 1.
   Although no one knows how many people are acutely sensitive to
fragrances, experts say that between 10 and 20 percent of Americans
may be sensitive to chemicals commonly used in fragrances.
   Michael Petrina, spokesman for the Cosmetic, Toiletry and
Fragrance Association, says fragrances bother relatively few
people, and that their hardship is offset by the benefit to
advertisers, magazines and interested consumers.
   It's unclear, he adds, if any sealant could totally eliminate
the possibility of exposure; it would, at any rate, increase the
cost of producing each strip as much as 10 times.
   But Sen. Connor says some sort of sealant, as required by his
bill, affords the only reliable protection.
   ``When a reader opens a magazine,'' he says, ``the only danger
should be a paper cut.''

<HEAD>Polish Capital Almost Out of Money</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Polish capital is almost out of money
because the nation's economic reform program has left thousands of
businesses facing bankruptcy and unable to make tax payments, the
city government reports.
   Large enterprises, small factories, craftsmen and foreign-linked
companies all have had trouble meeting their obligations and a
dramatic drop in revenues collected by the Warsaw government has
resulted, the media reported this week.
   In the province of Warsaw, which includes the city and
surrounding villages, local governments have paid only 3 percent of
their annual dues to the provincial government, the Zycie Warszawy
newspaper said.
   The local governments owe $50.6 million, money they are unable
to raise because they managed to collect only 40 percent of the
taxes owed to the village administrations, the newspaper said.
   Meanwhile, the national Finance Ministry is demanding the
provinces pay their contributions to the central budget, the
official PAP news agency said.
   ``All this has made it so that the (Warsaw) province is on the
edge of bankruptcy,'' acting provincial governor Adam Langer told
PAP.
   Langer said a precise review of the budget would be completed
this month, but it appears some municipal projects would have to be
halted. He said the province needs $15 million to complete
municipal investments this year.
   The shock reform program initiated Jan. 1 nationwide is designed
to turn Poland's weak centralized economy into a market-driven
capitalist system. The massive national budget subsidies provided
to enterprises have been cut off, forcing businesses to become
self-sufficient or face bankruptcy. Meanwhile, prices for goods
have risen dramatically, requiring companies to buy supplies at
market prices.
   Many state-run and private enterprises have trimmed
often-bloated work forces to stay in business. Unemployment,
officially unknown under the Communist system that was toppled a
year ago, last month reached 5 percent of the work force, or almost
700,000 workers.

<HEAD>More Than Gasoline: Price Rises Could Hit Other Sectors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If higher oil prices hold, the effect is expected to spread
beyond gasoline to utility bills, home mortgages, foodstuffs,
fertilizer, automobile tires and a myriad of other goods.
   ``The first victims in line will be utilities and transportation
industries,'' said economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc. in
Lexington, Mass. ``You can expect your electic bills going up.''
   Wyss said inflation via high oil prices ``gradually dribbles
down to almost everything in the economy.''
   The American Automobile Association reported Tuesday that
gasoline prices at the pump hit nearly five-year highs, as
self-service unleaded rose 1.5 cents overnight to $1.201 per
gallon, the highest price since the last week of 1985.
   In its sruvey of 1,400 stations nationwide, the AAA said
unleaded fuel increased 12.6 cents since last Wednesday, the day
before Iraq's takeover of Kuwait sent the price of crude oil
skyrocketing on world markets.
   Spot checks showed gasoline prices up as much as 25 cents in the
week at some Michigan service stations, among the biggest weekly
increases since the 1973 Arab oil embargo.
   Spokespeople for various industries that rely on oil for
transportation or production said rising fuel prices all add to
costs that would have to be passed onto consumers eventually.
   ``If it turns into a long-term permanent increase, it will have
an effect on all costs associated with fuel prices,'' said Michael
Rourke, spokesman for the A&amp;P supermarket chain, which operates
1,231 stores in 26 Eastern states and Canada.
   Frozen Food Express Industries Inc. in Dallas, which hauls
perishable products nationwide, is one of several companies that
has asked the government to approve a surcharge on regular shipping
rates because of the oil price rise.
   Chairman Stoney M. Stubbs Jr., whose company has 1,000
refrigeration trucks, said up to 20 percent of costs are related to
fuel.
   ``A 15 cents a gallon increase eats your profit up,'' said
Charles Lambright, an independent trucker in Jacksonville, Texas.
``The only way we can stay in business is with a surcharge.''
   Surcharges are passed on to the food companies or other users
and economists predict those increased costs gradually will show up
on supermarket shelves by October.
   Oil is a major component of the raw materials used to make
tires. ``If oil prices continue at higher levels prices will have
to reflect these higher raw material costs,'' a Goodyear Tire &amp;
Rubber Co. spokesman said.
   Dow Chemical Co. faces $600 million in additional energy
spending annually if the price of oil rises $3 a barrel, said
Leonard Bogner, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst.
   Petroleum-based raw material cost increases at comapnies such as
Dow could directly affect prices of plastics, fertilizer and other
products.
   Utilities that burn large amounts of oil pass changes in fuel
costs directly to customers when the fuel is used. One benefit:
Utilities use more natural gas in the summer, which could help
forestall bill increases.
   Boston Edison Co. said customers will pay more for electricity
if oil prices remain high after the utility's 30- to 45-day supply
of oil runs out. The utility generates about a third of its power
from oil in the summer and about two-thirds in the winter.
   Cameron H. Daley, senior vice president in charge of power
production, said Boston Edison's most recent oil purchase was at
$15 a barrel. If prices hold at $30 a barrel, the average customer
faces a $6 to $10 monthly increase.
   ``When I start burning that more expensive oil they start seeing
the increase in the bill,'' Daley said.
   Consolidated Edison Co. of New York said the price of
low-sulphur residual oil it burns rose to $23 a barrel Monday from
$18 a week earlier, and the added costs will be passed on to
consumers. Spokeswoman Rosalie Zuckerman said the utility has a
roughly six-week stock of oil purchased at lower prices.
   Home mortgage interest rates have risen as much as a half of a
percentage point in recent days to above 10 percent, following
Treasury bond yields upward in reaction to fears that higher oil
prices would trigger inflation.
   ``Right now there is a general pickup in daily applications as
people look in to lock in interest rates and protect themselves
from subsequent increases,'' said Countrywide's chief financial
officer, Stanford Kurland.

   It might seem strange that Anheuser-Busch Inc.
executives are pleased with only flat sales this year from their
workhorse brand, Budweiser, but they are.
   After growing phenomenally in the 1980s while other premium
brands sagged, sales of the King of Beers fell slightly last year,
according to industry estimates. It was the first sales decline
since 1976.
   This year, expected to be the industry's best since 1986,
Budweiser is showing no growth, according to company figures.
   Meanwhile, one of its leading competitors, Miller Genuine Draft,
which has only been around since 1986, is growing at a rapid pace
and became one of the 10 top-selling beers last year.
   Patrick Stokes, who just took over as president of
Anheuser-Busch Inc., admits the brand is not growing as much as it
has in the past. But he's not worried about speculation by industry
watchers who say the King may be in trouble.
   ``I think that people who are speculating about Budweiser would
be right on target if it were down 5 percent, but it's not,''
Stokes said in a recent interview. ``Budweiser even, or up or down
1 percent is fine.''
   Such growth is a new strategy for the St. Louis-based beermaker,
which sells 42 percent of the beer in the United States and is
pushing over the next few years to reach a 50 percent market share.
   And it's not surprising that Budweiser, which accounts for one
out of every four beer sales in the country, is being excluded from
the company's growth strategy.
   In today's beer industry, the future seems to be in light beers
and other specialized niches. The nation's second-, third- and
fourth-most popular beers are light beers. Two of them, Bud Light
and Coors Light, are among the fastest growing.
   The premium-beer segment, beers such as Budweiser, Miller High
Life and Coors, slipped 20 percent from 1980 to 1989, while overall
beers sales remained fairly stagnant.
   ``They've (Anheuser-Busch) realized that you can't have one beer
that's going to appeal to a mega-segment of the society,'' said Bob
Bernstein, a stock analyst for Edward D. Jones Co. in St. Louis.
``There are more specialized tastes out there and the company is
going after them.''
   There's even a question as to whether Miller Genuine Draft is a
niche beer rather than a premium beer.
   But if Budweiser isn't being counted on for growth and premium
beers are on the way out, then what does the future hold for the
brand, which has been around since 1876?
   ``Our job is to have Budweiser as a stable brand within our
system and have the other brands contributing to give us a net
positive,'' said Stokes, 47.
   Stokes took over the brewery job from his boss, August Busch
III, the chairman and chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch
Cos. Inc. The company owns the brewery, the St. Louis Cardinals
baseball team and several other subsidiaries.
   ``The question is can they do that and not let their very
original brand, Budweiser, get clobbered too much,'' said Joseph
Doyle, a stock analyst with Smith Barney in New York.
   In an unusual move and in an effort to prove that the country's
most popular beer is not getting clobbered, Stokes has decided to
disclose some usually private brewery sales figures.
   According to the company, Budweiser sales to retailers for 1990,
through July, are exactly the same as last year. For just July, the
brand was up 8.3 percent.
   The company is very happy with flat sales for Budweiser _ here's
why.
   The brewery introduced its popular Bud Dry earlier this year and
that brand has been eating into Budweiser sales. Stokes estimates
that for every two Bud Dry beers that are sold, one Budweiser sale
is lost.
   ``That's a rate that we could live with forever,'' Stokes said.
   Meanwhile, another member of the Budweiser family, Bud Light,
continues to grow and take some sales away from Budweiser. Bud
Light was up 9.4 percent from last year in adjusted sales to
retailers through July. To Anheuser-Busch executives and industry
analysts, that's an outstanding number.
   The whole Budweiser family is selling 5.9 percent more beer to
retailers than last year and the overall brewery is up 6.7 percent.
That increase comes in a year when industry analysts are predicting
only 2 percent growth.
   ``Those are rather fabulous numbers. I'd say they're awesome,''
said Jerry Steinman, president and publisher of Beer Marketer's
Insights, an industry newsletter. ``I knew they were having a good
year but I didn't know it was this good.''
   The significance of the ``sales to retailers'' numbers is that
they are the best gauge of how much beer is actually being sold.
They usually are well-guarded secrets.
   Normally, the nation's beermakers release ``sales to
wholesalers'' figures that are not as illuminating.
   Anheuser-Busch's job for the '90s, Stokes said, is to manage the
portfolio of beers it has introduced. Twenty years ago, the company
only sold three brands of beer _ Budweiser, Michelob and Busch.
Today it sells 17 brands, including four introduced this year.
   So far, the company's ``family approach'' to beer marketing
seems to be paying off. Two weeks ago, Anheuser-Busch announced
record profits and sales for the second quarter and the first half
of the year, primarily because of the success of its brewery.

   Blue chip issues displayed modest strength. The Dow Jones

   The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all its listed
common stocks added 0.22 to 183.67.
   The American Stock Exchange's market value index edged 0.04
higher to 339.88.
   Stock prices were expected to steady today, analysts said. The
market's mixed performance Tuesday, with the Dow Jones average
posting only a minor loss, indicated that the selling wave that had
swept through Wall Street since the turmoil flared in the Middle
East has eased.

   On Tuesday, the Dow industrial average lengthened its string of
losses to a sixth straight session, falling 5.70 to 2,710.64. Since
the market started sliding last Thursday when Iraq invaded Kuwait,
the best-known market indicator has lost 188.62 points, or 6.5
percent.
   Broader market measures managed to post minor improvements.
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.40 to 334.83 and the NYSE
composite index added 0.13 to 183.45.
   But overall, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by
about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks as jittery
investors continued to pull money out of equities. There were 740
issues up, 845 down and 449 unchanged.
   Trading activity was heavy for a fourth session in a row. Volume
on the floor of the Big Board came to 231.58 million shares, down
slightly from 240.40 million on Monday.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at

   The $1.8 billion merger of the Norton Co. with
Saint Gobain of Paris is expected to proceed following approval of
the merger by a federal commission.
   The Commission on Foreign Investment in the United States has
determined that the merger of the Worcester, Mass.-based abrasives
company with the French firm would not threaten national security,
Rep. Joseph Early, D-Mass., said Tuesday.
   Norton's board of directors approved the merger in late April
after British conglomerate BTR launched a hostile takeover bid.
   Saint Gobain, one of the world's leading glass makers, had come
forward with a friendly tender offer after BTR's takeover attempt
provoked outcries from Worcester officials and Norton employees and
raised concerns among Massachusetts legislators.
   Norton is a leading manufacturer of abrasives and engineering
materials that has defense contracts with the U.S. government. The
company, with 1989 sales of $1.5 billion, employs 16,000 people and
operates 113 plants abroad.

<HEAD>Ratners in Talks to Revise Offer for Kay Bonds, Deadline Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's largest jewelry chain, Ratners Group
PLC, said Wednesday that it was holding talks to revise the terms
of its offer to bondholders as part of its $328 million takeover
bid for the U.S.-based Kay Jewelers Inc.
   Ratners said it had extended the deadline for its bond offer by
24 hours until midnight EDT Wednesday. It declined to say how much
of the debt has been tendered so far.
   The statement from the company said that it currently was
negotiating revising terms of its offer with representatives of the
holders of each class of the notes but it declined to elaborate.
   It added that ``there is, however, no assurance that any
agreement between Ratners and such holders will be reached.''
   The Financial Times reported that bondholders were unhappy with
the terms, and that they wanted more money.
   However, Ratners could press ahead without bondholder approval,
because shareholders have given the deal a green light, the
Financial Times said.
   Ratners is offering $17 worth of stock for each of Kay's 12.4
million shares, and is assuming Kay's debt. Kay is based in
Alexandria, Va.
   The addition of Kay's 494 stores would increase Ratners' U.S.
outlets to nearly 1,000, making it the United States' second
largest jeweler after Zales.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is driving up oil
prices and causing some smiles on the faces of those who have
struggled through the ragged recovery of the U.S. oil industry.
   In America's energy capital of Houston, a city still in the
final recovery stages of the last oil bust, there are whispers of
another boom.
   ``The oil and gas business has been down for quite a while, and
so we need a little good news. But I hate for it to come as a
result of a war,'' said John Faulkinberry, chief financial officer
of Paramount Petroleum Co., an independent oil and gas exploration
and production company.
   The oil industry has been inching toward a renewed vigor for
some time, anticipating higher oil prices in the coming years.
   Companies began last year to increase their exploration budgets,
and new drilling and exploration techniques have sparked regional
booms in the oil patch.
   But with the cutoff of oil from Iraq and Kuwait, and worries
about the rest of the Persian Gulf, the stumbling recovery could
hit full stride.
   A sustained increase in oil prices could fuel domestic drilling
activity, raise revenues and attract investors who were scared away
when prices plunged in the mid-1980s, some observers said.
   ``There is an air of expectancy,'' Faulkinberry said. ``This one
event could really heat things up. It could drive up (domestic)
drilling activity and bring capital back into the industry.''
   ``This probably means the business is really going to jump into
second gear now,'' he added. ``I think a lot (of oil exploration
companies) will be more aggressive in their businesses.''
   The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and gas rose to
4,500 at the height of the boom in December 1981, but it plunged to
a low of 663 after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   This week, the count totaled 966 _ down 30 from the previous
week but up from the 874 working rigs a year ago, according to
Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc., which keeps track of the count.
   ``If prices remain at the current levels, I'd say you'd have a
significant impact (on drilling activity),'' Ike Kerridge, a vice
president at Baker Hughes, said. ``You could start seeing that in a
few weeks.''
   Others, however, are remaining cautious about the possible
impact of the present turmoil in the Middle East. They still
remember the devastating effect that plunging oil prices had on the
entire energy industry.
   ``There are still too many of us who have memories of the
previous boom,'' said Don Covey, president of the exploration and
production division of Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp., an
independent oil company based in The Woodlands north of Houston.
   ``People are going to be moving slowly because of the
uncertainty and because we have seen what has happened before,''
Covey said.
   Oil prices soared towards $40 per barrel in 1981, but by 1986
had fallen below $10 per barrel.
   The decline undercut the financial and real estate industries in
Texas, while the rest of the country enjoyed cheap gas.
   ``Regardless of the progress that's been made, the state is oil
and gas driven, Houston in particular,'' Faulkinberry said.
``Anytime you have an event like this happen that makes oil prices
go up, it's going to have an impact on Houston.''
   Oil prices increased since Iraq's invasion and already have been
passed along at the pumps.
   In his address to the nation today, President Bush said he asked
oil companies to ``show restraint and not abuse today's
uncertainties to raise prices.'' Bush also said he will ask other
oil-producing nations to replace embargoed Iraqi and Kuwait oil.
   Oil prices fell today in what traders said reflected confidence
that there would be enough world oil production to make up for
supplies lost in the wake of Iraq's invasion.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the cost of benchmark West
Texas Intermediate was off 81 cents at $27.50 a barrel at
midmorning. The contract had risen 26 cents in volatile trading
Tuesday to settle at its highest level since Dec. 6, 1985.
   Oil prices also sank in London. The spot price of Brent Blend,
the most widely traded international crude oil, fell $1.90 to
$25.50 a barrel.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with
corn and soybeans down slightly after a drop in crude oil reduced
inflationary fears.
   Analysts also said traders were evening up their positions in
preparation for Thursday's release of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture crop report, the first official estimate of U.S. corn
and soybean production levels.
   ``It's pre-report trading combined with nervousness about world
developments,'' said William Biedermann, research director for
Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Biedermann said that even after the report is released, the size
of this year's corn and soybean crops will be difficult to assess
and frost damage to late-maturing crops is real concern.
   Market analysts estimate this year's soybean crop at 1.86
billion bushels, down from 1.93 billion last year.
   Analysts estimate the corn harvest at 7.9 billion bushels, up
from 7.5 billion in 1989.
   The USDA report will be released after Thursday's close.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $2.81 a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.53 a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent higher with September at $1.17{
a bushel; soybeans were } cent to 1{ cents lower with August at

   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .25 cent lower with August at
77.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .40 cent lower
with August at 89.55 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent to 1.17

   The stock market rolled ahead today as traders
assessed the economic implications of developments in the Middle
East.
   Market analysts attributed the buying interest mostly to bargain
hunting after a slump on Wall Street that pushed stock prices to
attractively low levels.
   But buying enthusiasm was restrained by concerns that the market
remains vulnerable due to the unfolding Persian Gulf crisis.
   Blue chip issues built on their initial strength this morning.
By noon, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 25.99
to 2,736.63.
   Gainers outpaced losers by about 5 to 3 on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 851 up, 505 down and 482 unchanged.
   Activity slowed slightly from the recent brisk pace. Volume came
to 93.78 million shares at midday, down from 127.74 million at the
same point in Tuesday's session.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all its listed
common stocks added 1.63 to 185.08.
   The American Stock Exchange's market value index edged 0.08
higher to 339.92.
   Stock prices were expected to steady today, analysts said. The
market's mixed performance Tuesday, with the Dow Jones average
posting only a minor loss, indicated that the selling wave that had
swept through Wall Street since the turmoil flared in the Middle
East has eased.
   On Tuesday, the Dow industrial average lengthened its string of
losses to a sixth straight session, falling 5.70 to 2,710.64. Since
the market started sliding last Thursday when Iraq invaded Kuwait,
the best-known market indicator has lost 188.62 points, or 6.5
percent.

   Former Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten
Mahlmann, who stepped down amid charges his trading firm misused
customer's funds, will get $120,000 in severance pay, exchange
officials said.
   Mahlmann, who headed Stotler Group, Inc., resigned from his
company and the BOT last week after federal officials charged the
company with using customer funds to shore up its own finances.
   Exchange officials said Tuesday that Board of Trade directors
voted last Thursday to pay Mahlmann, nicknamed ``Cash,'' for the
rest of his term, which was scheduled to expire Jan. 22. His post
paid $240,000 per year.
   Stotler was forced into involuntary bankruptcy Friday, and a
special master has been placed in charge of three of the company's
customer funds. U.S. District Judge Milton I. Shadur has frozen all
of Stotler's assets.

<HEAD>American Airlines to Hike Fares 10 Percent Because of Fuel Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines said today it will
increase its fares by 10 percent because of what it called the
skyrocketing cost of fuel brought about by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   Michael W. Gunn, the airline's senior vice president for
marketing, said the increase will go into effect Friday for flights
in the continental United States, Hawaii and the Caribbean and on
Aug. 15 for international flights.
   In recent days, Pan American World Airways and Northwest
Airlines said they would raise their fares because of soaring fuel
costs.
   ``We regret the recent events in the Middle East have caused an
increase in the costs of fuel, leading to an increase in our fare
price. American Airlines wants to be fair and we are especially
sorry to do this, because higher fares will create hardships,''
Gunn said.
   ``Airlines feel the impact of fuel increases almost immediately.
Thus we must move rapidly to recover this cost since many seats
have already been sold at prices that don't reflect the fuel
increase,'' Gunn said.
   ``Even with the higher fares, we expect to recover only a
portion of the increased fuel costs, since we have already sold
half of our seats for the next two months at old prices,'' American
Airlines spokesman Tim Smith said.
   The higher fares apply only to tickets that are bought after the
increase goes into effect, Smith said.
   Fuel costs make up 15 percent of American Airlines' total
budget, ``but at the higher prices, we estimate it will be at least
20 percent,'' Smith said.
   On July 1, American Airlines was paying an average of 57 cents
per gallon for its fuel, Smith said.
   ``By today, the system average had risen to 68 cents. But the
spot market is already at 85 cents, and the spot is what our market
is based upon,'' Smith added.
   American Airlines uses 2.4 billion gallons of fuel a year. The
increased cost of fuel at this point means the carrier's annual
cost of $1.6 billion would soar to $2.3 billion, an increase of
about $720 million, Smith said.

   President Bush said today that the Middle East
crisis and the resulting increases in oil prices have not reduced
the necessity for a significant deficit-reduction agreement.
   ``I still think it's absolutely essential to get a budget
agreement (with Congress) and that's going to require a lot of
principle,'' Bush told a news conference.
   Congressional leaders and the administration have made little
progress in devising a deficit-reduction plan, agreeing only to
resume efforts next month.
   Bush implied that he soon will resume public criticism of
Democrats' negotiating posture. ``I don't feel bound by an
agreement that I've told the congressional leaders is no longer in
effect,'' he said, apparently referring to an earlier concession to
tone down political rhetoric about the negotiations.
   Congressional Republicans are unhappy that Democrats have
refused to put forth a specific proposal, even after Bush backed
away from a campaign pledge to oppose tax increases.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole told reporters today the
administration is still seeking a $500 billion, five-year
deficit-reduction plan. He added, however, that there is little
chance of raising gasoline taxes as part of that plan and
questioned how deeply defense spending could be cut in light of
U.S. military involvement in Saudi Arabia.
   Key members of Congress say they see no reason to ease up on
efforts to reach an agreement.
   ``If the economy begins to look really bad, every element of the
deficit-reduction package will be threatened,'' Rep. Bill Frenzel,
R-Minn., ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, said
Tuesday. ``Right now, the major effect is to make an energy tax
less likely.''
   A military face-off with Iraq also could fuel arguments that
slashing the $300 billion defense budget is a bad idea right now.
``It's living proof there are mean people in the world and we need
a respectable national defense,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   However, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.,
said the proposed $10 billion to $15 billion in military cuts
``really aren't that deep in the first place.''
   Petroleum prices have jumped several dollars closer to $30 per
barrel since Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait last week. Fuel costs in
the United States are already rising, along with prices for other
goods and services such as airline tickets and electricity.
   Bargainers concede that with fuel prices rising, raising taxes
on gasoline or other sources of energy becomes less palatable.
   ``I think it probably will kill any effort to have a broad-based
energy tax,'' Gramm said.
   Congressional leaders and Bush administration officials have
struggled inconclusively since May to forge a package of tax
increases and spending cuts totaling $50 billion for next year and
$500 billion over five years. The summit talks are on hold for
Congress' August recess.
   Iraq's takeover of Kuwait _ and resulting military and economic
moves by the United States and its allies _ means the American
economy could be weaker when the bargainers reconvene in September.
Negotiators said they would watch economic performance closely.
   ``Anybody who thinks we're not being forced into a re-evaluation
these next few weeks is kidding themselves,'' said House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   If the economy seems shaky, one option would be to lower the
amount of taxes and spending cuts slated for fiscal 1991, which
starts Oct. 1.
   ``Under any circumstances, we need to focus on significant
deficit reduction over five years,'' said Panetta.
   But budget bargainers said no reasons have yet surfaced to shoot
for a less ambitious deficit-cutting package.
   ``I don't think we can see clearly enough into the future to
know how much we'll be affected,'' said Frenzel. ``I think the
summiteers ought to go forward with the plan we've been
discussing.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly Wednesday in dealings in
Europe, supported by worries about rising tensions in the Persian
Gulf.
   Gold traded in a narrow range.
   European dealers said the possiblity of a conflict with Iraq
outweighed fundamental concerns about weakness in the U.S. economy
that could drive interest rates lower and make the dollar less
appealing to foreign investors.
   ``There's only one reason for the firmer dollar and that's the
general situation in the Middle East,'' said Werner Esch, a trader
at Bethmann Bank in Frankfurt. ``Something is going to have to
happen here. Either Iraq will yield and withdraw from Kuwait or the
Americans are going to march in.''
   Bauer said as long as the situation remains unclear, the dollar
will continue to gain support. Once matters are more settled, he
said, the chances are that the dollar will resume its downward
drift.
   Some currency dealers in Europe debated whether the dollar was
the safest currency to hold, but they generally agree that growing
tensions in the Gulf will help mute any aggressive attempts to take
the dollar lower for now.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 150.00 Japanese yen from
150.60 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 150.15
yen. At midday in New Yor, the dollar was quoted at 149.90 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8660 from $1.8765 late
Tuesday. At midday in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.8680.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.5940 German marks, up from 1.5763; 1.3435
Swiss francs, up from 1.3315; 5.3445 French francs, up from 5.2995;
1.7955 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7785; 1,166.37 Italian lire, up
from 1,155.37, and 1.1485 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1495.
   Selected dollar rates at midday in New York included: 1.5930
German marks, 1.34005 Swiss francs, 1,164.75 Italian lire and
1.14815 Canadian dollars.
   Gold fell in London to $382.25 a troy ounce from $383.25 late
Tuesday. But in Zurich, bullion rose to $384.35 an ounce from
$383.15 late Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 87 cents to close at $382.65 an
ounce.
   Silver bullion fell in London to $4.87 a troy ounce from $4.89
late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beecham PLC, the Anglo-American health
and household products company, said Wednesday its second-quarter
profit jumped 47 percent over a year ago.
   The company said the good performance was highlighted by
continued sales growth, strong operating profits and significant
debt reduction.
   Net profit for the three months ended June 30 came to 174
million pounds, or about $303 million, compared with 118 million
pounds ($205 million) in the same period a year ago.
   Earnings per share rose to 9.3 pence, or 16.2 cents, from 9.1
pence (16 cents). Pre-tax profit rose 6.5 percent to 197 million
pounds, or $343 million, from 185 million pounds ($322 million).
   Sales climbed 3 percent to 1.21 billion pounds, or $2.1 billion,
from 1.18 billion pounds ($2.05 billion).
   The results are the second set reported on a quarterly basis
since Beecham PLC and SmithKline Beckman Corp. merged in July 1989.
Year-earlier figures were presented as if the merger had been in
place in the second quarter of 1989.
   In the latest quarter, net debt totalled 822 million pounds, or
$1.43 billion, down from 1.47 billion pounds in the first quarter.
The company realized 352 million pounds ($612 million) from asset
disposals.
   For the first six months of the year, net profit rose 45 percent
to 399 million pounds, or $694 million, from 276 million pounds
($480 million). Earnings per share came to 20.1 pence, or 35 cents,
compared with 21.4 pence. Pre-tax profit fell 1 percent to 416
million pounds ($724 million) from 420 million pounds ($731
million).
   Sales rose 14 percent to 2.3 billion pounds, or $4 billion, from
2.01 billion pounds ($3.5 billion).
   All figures were converted at a company-provided exchange rate
of 1.74 American dollars to the pound.

Stock Exchange Wednesday, after a hectic, choppy session in which
investors assessed the minute-by-minute developments in the Middle
East.
   ``Confusion remains extremely high in world equity markets,''
said Paul Harrison, a vice president at Salomon Brothers
International in London.
   ``Money managers don't have a clear view on how the Middle East
situation will resolve itself over the next days or weeks,''
Harrison said. ``Volatility is expected to remain high with
constant watching of the news tapes for the next five-minute
trend.''
   Shares opened on a strong footing but were reduced to losses
later in the session as a wave of war rumors flooded the market.
However, stocks were driven from mid-afternoon minimums by an early
burst on Wall Street.
   By the close of the London day, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 25.99 points at 2,736.63.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 1.7
points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,237.5 at the close. The sesion peak
was 2,253.2, while its minimum was 2,217.9.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 0.1 point at
1,748.5. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 0.3 point to
close at 1,210.76.
   Volume came to 429.2 million shares compared with 497.5 million
shares Tuesday.

<HEAD>Contract Deadlock Continues Between Western Union and Union
Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Management and labor officials
from Western Union Corp. said Wednesday they were closer to a
contract settlement but were stalled on medical benefits.
   ``We're closer, but we've still got a long way to go,'' said Dan
J. Beckstead, president of the Communications Workers of
America-United Telegraph Workers Bargaining Council.
   Both sides said they were on call to resume talks, but no
meetings were scheduled.
   A two-year contract between employees and the giant telegram
company expired Monday, and a strike authorization vote, taken last
week, is casting its shadow over the talks. But no settlement
deadline has been set, Beckstead said.
   Western Union spokesman Warren Bechtel agreed that progress has
been made, but declined to provide details.
   On Tuesday night, the company presented what it termed its final
offer, a package that Beckstead said included a 4 percent wage
increase and removed an earlier demand to boost the ranks of
part-time employees not entitled to union benefits.
   Western Union continue to demand curtailed medical benefits that
would require employees to pay higher out-of-pocket expenses and
would place restrictions on eligibility after retirement.
   The final offer also scrubs a wage investment plan established
in 1985 to repay employees for wage cuts and concessions, said
Bechtel, noting that the company hasn't made a profit that has
yielded a return to employees.
   Bechtel said the company, based in Upper Saddle River, is
seeking a contract that will allow it to operate profitably for the
first time in more than seven years.
   Past contract disputes between Western Union and its workers
have provoked three major strikes, ranging from 10 days to 57 days,
since 1952.
   Communications Workers of America represents operators, customer
relations clerks, other clerical workers and field technicians that
work for Western Union nationwide, Beckstead said.

   The stock market rebounded today as traders
reacted positively to developments in the Middle East crisis.
   Market analysts also attributed the buying interest to bargain
hunting after a slump on Wall Street that pushed stock prices to
attractively low levels.
   But buying enthusiasm was restrained by concerns that the market
remains vulnerable due to the unfolding Persian Gulf crisis.
   Blue chip issues maintained their earlier strength. By 2 p.m.,
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 25 to 2,735.64.
   Gainers outpaced losers by about 9 to 5 on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 968 up, 538 down and 435 unchanged.

   The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all its listed

   The American Stock Exchange's market value index edged 0.50
higher to 340.34.
   The market's mixed performance Tuesday, with the Dow Jones
average posting only a minor loss, indicated that the selling wave
that had swept through Wall Street since the turmoil flared in the
Middle East has eased.
   On Tuesday, the Dow industrial average lengthened its string of
losses to a sixth straight session, falling 5.70 to 2,710.64. Since
the market started sliding last Thursday when Iraq invaded Kuwait,
the best-known market indicator has lost 188.62 points, or 6.5

   The Magma Copper Co. will give more than
3,000 hourly employees $1,000 each in bonuses for helping the
company achieve record earnings, management and union spokesmen say.
   The company will give the workers two $500 bonuses, the first
next week and the second near Christmas, the spokesmen said Tuesday.
   Magma spokesman Frank Harris said the bonuses were a way of
``thanking employees for helping Magma achieve significant
improvement in operations over the last 12 months, since the
signing of the current labor agreement.''
   Don Shelton, president of united Steelworkers Local 937, said
the action is ``a real indication of the spirit of cooperation that
has been generated here. It is going to be a real boost in
everybody's credibility.''
   He said union leaders suggested the idea of a bonus last month
to Magma's president and chief executive officer, J. Burgess
Winter, after Magma announced record earnings and increased
productivity.

<TEXT>
   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell in
Wednesday's auction to the lowest level in six months as the
government's quarterly refunding continued.
   The average yield was 8.77 percent, down from 8.88 percent at
the last auction on May 9.
   It was the lowest rate since 10-year notes averaged 8.59 percent
on Feb. 7. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 8.75
percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,986.90.
   A total of $10.5 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling
$16.7 billion.
   The refunding concludes Thursday with the auction of $10.25
billion in 30-year bonds and $10 billion in 36-day cash management
bills. It began on Tuesday with the sale of $11.5 billion in
three-year notes.
   The notes and bonds are regularly sold at auctions held four
times a year to replenish the government's coffers. Undersecretary
Robert Glauber said the proceeds would refund $20 billion of
privately-held notes maturing on Aug. 15 and raise approximately
$12.25 billion of cash.
   When the current auctions were announced last week, there was
some concern whether they would have to be postponed as the
government approached its borrowing limit.
   However, Congress approved a hike in the debt ceiling over the
weekend from $3.12 trillion to $3.195 trillion and the Treasury
announced on Monday the auctions would proceed on schedule.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy will not be able to avoid
a recession later this year even if the explosive Middle East
situation eases soon, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Wednesday.
   ``We anticipate that the economy will grind to a virtual
standstill during the third quarter of this year and actually
contract by 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter,'' said Richard W.
Rahn, chamber vice president and chief economist.
   ``Our forecast shows the economy continuing to experience
negative real growth in the first quarter of 1991 and practically
no growth in the second quarter,'' he told a news conference.
   Rahn said the impending recession is due to ``misguided economic
policy'' and not Middle East developments although, ``Iraqi
adventurism in the Middle East is exacerbating this country's
economic weakness.''
   Even without the Mideast impact, a recession is unavoidable,
Rahn said.
   Although the Bush administration and Congress must share the
blame for a recession, the Federal Reserve is most responsible, he
said.
   ``For over two years, the Fed has labored under the mistaken
fear that economic growth causes inflation and has pursued a credit
policy designed to slow real economic growth,'' Rahn contended.
``It is time for the Fed, Congress and the administration to adopt
pro-growth economic policies.''
   With ``correct policy choices,'' the economy will begin to
rebound during the third quarter of next year, he added.
   Rahn called on the Fed, as he has repeatedly, to rescind its
high-interest rate policy and allow markets to set the levels. At
the same time, he said the Fed should open its policy-making
process to the public.
   ``It is unconscionable that unelected central bankers are
permitted to determine the nation's economic fate in secrecy
without any form of public accountability,'' he said.
   Rahn also called on the administration and Congress to cease
efforts to create a five-year budget deficit reduction package that
includes tax increases.
   Instead, he said, budget negotiators should adopt ``pro-growth''
tax cuts, including a lowering of the capital gains rate and
reduction of the Social Security payroll tax.

<TEXT>
   Woolworth Corp. on Wednesday reported it earned
4.2 percent more in the second quarter than a year earlier as
revenue rose 10 percent.
   The retailer had net income of $50 million, or 39 cents a share,
in the three months ended July 28, up from $48 million, or 37 cents
a share, in the corresponding 1989 quarter. Revenue grew to $2.19
billion from $1.98 billion.
   Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer of the New
York-based retailer, said profits declined in the specialty chains
of Woolworth's U.S. apparel group and Canadian and Australian
operations due to increased promotional activity.
   Those declines were offset by earnings improvements at the
European, domestic Woolworth and domestic Kinney shoe operations,
he said.
   The corporation owns numerous strings of specialty retailers in
addition to its Woolworth variety store chain. Among its retailers
are the Foot Locker and Lady Foot athletic shoe stores and the
Champs sporting goods chain.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, Woolworth earned $88
million, or 68 cents a share, up 4.8 percent from $84 million, or
65 cents a share, through two quarters of 1989.
   Revenue rose 10 percent to $4.26 billion in the first half from
$3.86 billion a year earlier.

   Wheat futures prices rose modestly Wednesday on

   Atlantic Richfield Co. today froze wholesale
fuel prices for one week, becoming the first U.S. oil company to
heed a request by President Bush to control prices during the
Middle East crisis.
   Arco, based in Los Angeles, said prices of gasoline, diesel and
jet fuel would remain at today's level.
   ``We hope the market will stabilize during this time, but if at
the end the week our position is out of line with world market
prices we will have to recognize that fact,'' George Babikian,
president Arco Products Co., the company's refining and marketing
division, said in a statement.
   ``We will not raise our prices even then unless we are
substantially below the general market,'' he said. ``Otherwise, if
we remain below the market we risk a run on our stations which
could drain our supply and create a panic buying situation in the
marketplace.''
   Arco said it was encouraging its dealers, who by federal law set
their own prices, not to increase pump prices. The company also
called for the driving public to begin conserving fuel ``in support
of the president's effort to lead the country through this crisis.''
   In a televised address on the Middle East situation earlier
today, Bush called for oil companies ``to do their fair share'' in
holding down gasoline prices, which have risen about 13 cents a
gallon at the pump in the last week. An Arco spokesman said the
company had raised wholesale prices by only 4 cents a gallon since
Iraq took over Kuwait last week while the spot market for gasoline
had jumped 20 cents.
   Arco receives most of its crude oil from Alaska and not the
Middle East, but the spokesman said the cost of its crude oil still
reflects world market prices.
   Company officials acknowledged that it could lose money through
the price freeze, but said they wanted to comply with Bush's
request.
   Other oil companies today said they supported Bush's call for
restraint, but blamed market forces for rising prices and said they
had behaved fairly in raising prices.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former owner of the defunct Lamar Savings
Association said Wednesday he is innocent of federal criminal
charges in the failure of the $2 billion thrift.
   Stanley E. Adams Jr. said he did nothing wrong or different than
many other S&amp;L executives.
   ``If I am to be indicted and tried for my actions, then every
banker and savings and loan official in Texas during the past
decade should be indicted and brought to trial,'' said Adams, whose
S&amp;L once applied to open a branch on the moon.
   Adams, an unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial candidate this
year, was named late Tuesday in a 14-count indictment alleging
misapplications of $121.1 million in S&amp;L funds; so were three other
ex-Lamar officers and two borrowers.
   The indictment accused Adams and the others of trying to hide
Lamar Savings' poor financial condition from the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board and of arranging ``sham'' loans to fund purchases of
repossessed real estate from the troubled thrift's portfolio.
   ``The blame for this tragedy should be laid where it belongs _
at the doorstep of the Reagan administration,'' which deregulated
S&amp;Ls, Adams said in a written statement. ``These indictments
against me are part of what has become a political issue and little
more.''
   In Washington, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh called Lamar
``one of the most notorious failures in the Southwest and among the
top 100 S&amp;L fraud cases'' being investigated.
   Adams' lawyer, Henry Novak, contended the former thrift
executive is the victim of a double standard under which the
government allowed certain S&amp;L business practices in the early
1980s, but now calls them fraud.
   Novak said Lamar's transactions were legitimate. But prosecutors
now are applying new ``theories of criminality'' to what once was
standard S&amp;L practice, he said.
   ``It was business as usual in the savings and loan industry in
1983, '84 and '85. But now Bush administration _ since the entire
industry has collapsed _ what you're doing is taking the position
that that was fraud, that that was wrongdoing,'' Novak said.
   Novak, who is defending Adams in a $100 million civil suit filed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said government regulators
long were out to get Adams because he was an innovative maverick in
a staid business.
   ``Stanley Adams had been the target for quite some time of bad
feelings on the part of the regulators. He was an innovator. He was
different. He was a maverick in an industry in which conformity was
a very important thing,'' Novak said.
   Adams was principal owner of Lamar Savings from 1973 to December
1985. Government regulators shut it down in May 1988. It was the
biggest thrift failure in central Texas, and officials have
estimated the cost to the government at $1 billion.
   The colorful Adams, 56, unsuccessfully ran for governor in this
year's primary. When filing for the Democratic nomination, he
listed his occupation as ``alleged white-collar racketeer.''
   Several years ago, Lamar applied to federal regulators to open a
branch office on the moon, naming a crater where the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration proposed to build a space
station. No action ever was taken.
   At a news conference Wednesday, publicist Garry Entress released
Adams' statement and one from a second defendant, former Lamar
senior vice president Reuben Coleman, who said he was innocent and
also protested what he called political interference.
   ``The current climate in Washington _ what I would describe as a
feeding frenzy of vindictiveness _ played a role in this action,''
Coleman said.

   Architect Stephen Chiang always wanted a home in bustling
midtown Manhattan, but skyrocketing real estate prices during the
free-spending '80s relegated him to the life of a New Jersey
commuter.
   With the bang of an auctioneer's gavel, Chiang, 30, finally got
his wish: a luxury studio apartment in a prime New York spot for
$129,000, nearly a third off the asking price.
   Dozens of other successful bidders snapped up about $9 million
worth of what they considered bargain condominiums during a recent
auction. In turn, the cash-strapped developer quickly disposed of
hard-to-sell property.
   Once the dismal realm of bank foreclosures, bankrupt farmers and
estate liquidations, auctions have become an increasingly popular
way to peddle property in today's sluggish market. Even individual
homeowners, frustrated by a dearth of buyers, have resorted to the
auction alternative.
   ``The auction marketing industry is no longer a last resort,''
said Jim Gall, president of Auction Co. of America in Miami, which
expects to auction a record $100 million in residential property
this year. ``It's not a giveaway process. It's a way to bring the
top dollar.
   ``We're seeing it in distressed areas, but also where the
markets are reasonably strong.''
   Stephen Martin, president of the Gwent Group, a real estate
consulting firm in Bloomington, Ind., estimates the volume of all
real estate sold through auction jumped to $26.5 billion last year
from $10 billion in 1980. He predicts overall volume will rise by
at least 10 percent in 1990.
   Auctions offer sellers the prime advantage of speed, while
giving buyers the chance for a bargain.
   Developers of the Manhattan complex, where Chiang got his condo,
probably are saving at least $1 million in annual ``carrying
costs,'' since it might have taken them as long as three years to
sell their remaining 55 vacant units under current market
conditions, said Michael Fine, senior coordinator for Sheldon Good
&amp; Co. of Chicago, the auctioneer.
   Fine said the apartments sold for an average 32 percent off the
asking price.
   In nearby Queens, N.Y., developer Tim Naples said he expects to
pay off most of his debts on a 207-unit townhouse project after
auctioning the last 68 units this past spring. The carrying costs,
which include mortgage payments and utilities, had amounted to
about $150,000 a month.
   ``We couldn't have gone on much longer,'' Naples said. ``I'm
sure the banks would have taken over the place and done their own
auction or sold it to some investor at a lower price.''
   Auctioneers say they can offer the same help to individuals
trying to sell their homes. A growing number are feeling squeezed
by the worst market for housing since the 1981-82 recession.
   ``An auction is ideal for people who are caught between two
houses ... (and) can't afford to wait a year to sell one of them,''
said Steven L. Good, Sheldon Good's president.
   Auctions also can work in strong markets by helping bring the
best price when competition among buyers is brisk, Good said.
   About 20 percent of Sheldon Good's $250 million in residential
auction sales last year were from individual homes, and Good
expects that to rise to 30 percent of an anticipated $350 million
in sales this year.
   Many real estate experts are predicting that by the end of the
decade individual homeowners will be using auctions just as
frequently as developers do now.
   They've long been an accepted practice overseas. In Australia,
where people attend auctions the way Americans go to garage sales,
at least a third of all home sales are sold by the gavel.
   ``We don't believe it's an end all,'' Good said. ``Conventional
brokers are here to stay. But in a number of situations auctions
are preferable, and the broker community has acknowledged that.''
   The National Associaton of Realtors once resisted selling homes
though auction, considering it a direct threat to the property
brokerage profession. But the group has begun to embrace the
practice. Last November, it set up a special committee to advise
members how to work with auctioneers.
   All this comes as the government prepares to auction billions of
dollars in real estate from insolvent savings and loan
institutions, a potential windfall to the auctioneering industry.
   ``It's not competition. It's more cooperation,'' Norman D.
Flynn, president of the National Association of Realtors, said of
the auctioneering business. ``It fits closely into what we're
doing.''
   He said brokers can act as consultants to auctioneers by pricing
or inspecting a home within a familiar marketplace, or they can
represent prospective buyers by inspecting a property or even
bidding on their behalf.
   Auctions are conducted two ways. In an absolute auction,
property goes to the highest bidder regardless of price. In a
reserve-basis auction, a minimum acceptable price is set, or the
seller can be granted 48 hours to decide whether to accept or
reject the highest bid.
   Sellers prefer the reserve-basis method, while buyers prefer
absolute sales. In cases where a large number of units are
auctioned, auctioneers usually recommend sellers set aside a few
for absolute sale as a way of drawing buyer interest and sell the
rest the reserve way.
   Regardless, there are potential pitfalls for sellers and buyers.
   For one thing, selling property by auction is more expensive
than using a traditional broker. The auctioneer takes the region's
prevailing broker's fee _ from 4 percent to 10 percent of the sale
price _ plus often charges for advertising the property or renting
an auction hall. That can cost as much as 5 percent more and is
payable regardless whether the property sells.
   Buyers could lose money, too. Immediately after a bid is
accepted, they're required to sign a sales contract, so in most
cases there's no turning back.
   Unlike offers to buy a house through a broker, auction sales
agreements aren't subject to a successful bidder's ability to
obtain a mortgage. Some buyers have lost their deposits because
they couldn't follow through with a purchase, auctioneers say.
   Also, in cases of multiple-unit auctions, buyers may not always
get their first choice.
   ``The ones (apartments) I wanted bidded out in the very
beginning,'' said architect Chiang. ``I still got a good bargain. A
few years ago real estate was unreasonable in Manhattan. It's
getting reasonable now. I hope it's going to rebound right now.''
   Walter Carr, a Charleston, S.C., real estate agent who recently
picked up a couple of two-bedroom apartments via auction in his
hometown's posh historic district, says he already has seen a
rebound.
   Not only did he buy the units for around 50 percent below the
asking price but has resold one for a profit exceeding $50,000.
   Douglas Clemens, president of Louis Traiman Real Estate Auction
Co. of Philadelphia, said auctions can be seen as a way of
validating the price of real estate _ similiar to the workings of
the financial markets.
   ``The auctions will produce the markets,'' he said. ``They
(property) are like a commodity.''
   Nonetheless, it's difficult for many people to think of their
homes in that way, especially if they bought when prices were at a
peak and have watched helplessly as prices have declined in recent
years, auctioneers admit.
   ``(Individual) sellers are too emotional,'' said Joel Zegart,
president and founder JBS &amp; Associates Inc. in Chicago. ``A lot of
people bought a year or two ago and don't have the equity yet. They
may have thought their property will go up 10 percent every year.
   ``It's like a game of musical chairs. The music has finally
stopped.''

<HEAD>Stocks Stage Rebound as Bargain Hunters Snap Up Good Buys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market made a comeback today as
investors snapped up issues that had been pushed to attractively
low prices during Wall Street's recent weak spell.
   A retreat in oil prices and strength in the bond market this
morning contributed to an improved attitude toward stocks.
   The perception that tensions in the Middle East might be
diffused without prolonged difficulty also helped restore investor
confidence and encouraged renewed buying.
   ``A lot of stocks looked like real bargains,'' said Hugh
Johnson, investment strategist at First Albany Corp. ``There were
plenty of stocks that were either dirt cheap or, at a minium,
undervalued.''
   But some buying enthusiasm was subdued by concerns that the
financial markets remain vulnerable to shocks from developments in
the Middle East.
   The slide in petroleum prices caused a selloff in oil and
related stocks. The contract for September delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, pulled back by
$2.35 to $25.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts took comfort from the stock market's ability to
maintain its advance today despite an afternoon downturn in bonds
and a jump in interest rates.

<TEXT>
   A millworkers' union says it is drafting a
proposal for employees to buy Roseburg Forest Products Co., in an
attempt to protect jobs.
   ``I assume we will make a viable proposal unless something
breaks down in the next few days,'' Mike Draper, executive
secretary of the Western Council of Industrial Workers, said
Tuesday.
   Draper said he was not overly optimistic about the buyout's
success, but said, ``We will make our presence known.''
   Roseburg Forest Products is the largest privately held wood
products company in the nation. It owns 14 mills in southern Oregon
and Northern Californa and about 850,000 acres of timberland.
Draper said it has 4,500 employees.
   The company is controlled by founder and board chairman Kenneth
Ford, 82, and a few family members.
   The Oregonian newspaper quoted an unnamed timber industry
consultant as estimating the purchase price could exceed $1
billion. No asking price has been revealed, and Roseburg has
refused comment on a proposed sale of the company.
   Draper said the union has retained Keilin &amp; Bloom of New York to
draft a purchase proposal. The firm helped plan the March buyout of
Colt Firearms in Connecticut and the proposed employee buyout of
UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines.
   Though preliminary planning has been conducted without
consulting union members, no plans would be made final without a
vote, Draper said.
   ``You've got to get your oar in the water if you're going to
paddle the boat,'' he said. ``We will keep them informed if we get
to round two.''

<HEAD>Japanese Firm Buys 50 Percent Interest in Lipstein's Magazine
Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese media concern has purchased a 50
percent stake in the magazine company that publishes Mother Earth
News, Psychology Today and the men's magazine Smart.
   The investment, disclosed Tuesday, was seen as a key part of
publisher Owen Lipstein's effort to save his New American Magazine
Co.
   Lipstein announced that Japanese Independent Communication Co.,
a 20-year-old media company based in Tokyo, had paid an undisclosed
sum for a half-interest in his company.
   Published reports said the price was less than $15 million.
   The acquisition was believed to be the first major investment in
American magazine publishing by a Japanese company.
   JICC publishes 10 magazines and more than 300 books a year. It
also produces records, music videos and compact disks, computer
software and films.
   The Japanese company said it hope its partnership with New
American Magazine will result in developing a ``leading edge
publishing and media organization in the United States.''
   Lipstein said he will continue as chairman and president of the
company, as publisher of Mother Earth News and Psychology Today and
president of Smart, a magazine he owns with its founder Terry
McDonell.
   McDonell will continue as chairman of Smart and will serve as
that magazine's publisher and editor in chief.
   Lipstein's company has faced severe financial problems over the
past year as he struggled to pay the debt incurred in buying Mother
Earth News in 1985 and Psychology Today in 1988.
   He sold American Health magazine to Reader's Digest Association
last year for $29.1 million, but that did not resolve the financial
problems.
   Psychology Today suspended publication in December. It is
expected to be relaunched this fall.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Gold Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended higher Wednesday against all
major currencies except the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar,
boosted by the rising tensions in the Middle East.
   Gold prices declined following a mixed performance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $383.20 a troy ounce, down $1.30 from Tuesday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$382.70 an ounce, off $2.80.
   Currency dealers said the dollar started out sharply higher,
then fell back on technical factors.
   President Bush said Wednesday that U.S. warplanes and combat
troops, backed by an armada of Navy ships, took up defensive
positions in Saudi Arabia to protect that country against a
possible invasion by Iraq.
   The announcement seemed to calm the financial markets.
   Nonetheless, the possiblity of a conflict with Iraq pushed the
dollar higher, dealers said. Those concerns, they said, outweighed
any fundamental worries about economic weakness that could drive
interest rates lower and make the dollar less appealing to foreign
investors.
   ``On fears of the Middle East the dollar was way up,'' said
Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for the Bank of New
York.
   Some dealers in Europe, though, debated whether the dollar was
the safest currency to hold right now.
   In fact, after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait last week, which
touched off the Mideast tensions, currency dealers flocked to the
German mark. The dollar had declined on worries that a rapid rise
in oil prices eventually would push interest rates lower.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell
to a closing 150.00 Japanese yen from 150.60 yen Tuesday. It traded
at 150.15 yen in London, and at 149.90 yen in New York, down from
150.90.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound compared to
Tuesday. Sterling traded at $1.8660 in London, down from $1.8765,
and at $1.86885 in New York, down from $1.8715.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.5920 German marks, up from 1.5875;
1.3380 Swiss francs, up from 1.3370; 5.3365 French francs, up from
5.3230; 1,165.00 Italian lire, up from 1,162.25; and 1.14785
Canadian dollars, down from 1.15125.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.5940 German
marks, up from 1.5763; 1.3435 Swiss francs, up from 1.3315; 5.3445
French francs, up from 5.2995; 1.7955 Dutch guilders, up from
1.7785; 1,166.37 Italian lire, up from 1,155.37, and 1.1485
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1495.
   Gold fell in London to $382.25 an ounce from $383.25 late
Tuesday. But in Zurich, bullion rose to $384.35 an ounce from
$383.15.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 87 cents to close at $382.65 an
ounce.
   Silver prices slipped. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.843 a troy ounce, down from $4.857
Tuesday. Silver fell in London to $4.87 an ounce from $4.89.

<HEAD>Oil Falls, Stocks Rise As Oil-Shortage Threats Appear To Diminish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices sank and stocks rose Wednesday as the markets
assessed prospects that many oil-producing nations could step into
the breach and pump plenty of crude to prevent shortages from
further Iraqi militance in the Persian Gulf.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the cost of key West Texas
Intermediate crude for September delivery plummeted $2.35 to settle
at $25.96 a barrel. The contract had risen 26 cents in volatile
trading Tuesday to close at its highest level since Dec. 6, 1985,
according to Mercantile Exchange records.
   Prices for petroleum products also declined sharply. The
near-term contract for unleaded gasoline plunged 6.18 cents to
settle at 76.21 cents a gallon, while home heating oil finished at
70.13 cents a gallon, off 5.01 cents. Other contract months
declined by lesser amounts.
   Stock prices gained ground around the world as traders searched
for bargains and expressed relief that events in the Persian Gulf
appeared to show signs of stabilizing, despite the virtual shutoff
of oil from Iraq and its occupied neighbor Kuwait.
   ``It's not as volatile a situation as it was perceived to be,
and (investors) are a little more confident of taking a position,''
said James Schroeder, an analyst at Chicago-based MMS International.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which slipped 5.70 points on
Tuesday for its sixth straight loss, gained 24.26 points to close
at 2,734.90.
   ``Clearly the dominant factor in the market ... was the alleged
commitment by the Saudis that they are going to increase oil
production,'' said Bob Baker, senior energy analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Experts said Iraq and Kuwait together produced about 4 million
barrels of crude daily, but increased Saudi production could cover
about 50 percent of that.
   A number of other oil producers, including Venezuela, Mexico,
Iran and Nigeria, also indicated they could up production.
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, for example, was reported
to have offered to sell the United States an additional 500,000
barrels of oil a day.
   But there remained no clear indication that oil producers
actually had begun pumping extra crude. In fact, OPEC President and
Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena said ``individual
initiatives'' by OPEC members ``should be avoided.''
   He said fears of supply disruptions were the result of
``psychological and speculative factors, (rather) than real market
fundamentals.'' Analysts interpreted Boussena's statement as a call
for the West to draw down its petroleum stocks before OPEC would
move to fill any supply gaps.
   There was a growing perception that oil reserves are plentiful.
President Bush also sought to allay fears of an oil shortage by
saying Wednesday that he was considering dipping into the nation's
strategic reserves to bolster supplies in the face of an absence of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil exports.
   Traders in the oil pits were anticipating an escalation of
hostilities, but nothing unexpected surfaced. A statement out of
Baghdad declared Kuwait part of Iraq but stopped short of saying
Iraq had annexed the tiny emirate following last week's lightning
raid led by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The statment came less than two hours after President Bush told
the nation that U.S. troops were taking up ``defensive positions''
in oil-rich Saudi Arabia to guard against a possible attack by Iraq.
   In London, the spot price of Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, fell to $25.40 a barrel from $27.40 late
Tuesday.
   Stock prices rose on major foreign markets. In Tokyo, the Nikkei
index of 225 shares recouped 856.07 points, or 3.10 percent, ending
the day at 28,509.14. Traders said the rebound reflected stability
in bond and currency markets.
   The Nikkei lost 946.46 on Tuesday and had dropped 3,184.92
points since Thursday, when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Prices got off to a bumpy start in Europe but managed to close
higher on the London Stock Exchange. The Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was up 1.7 points, or 0.08 percent, at
2,237.5 at the close after seesawing throughout most of the session.
   In other financial markets, bond prices narrowly mixed. The
Treasury's auction of $10.5 billion in 10-year notes went off worse
than expected and depressed the credit markets.
   In the currency markets, the dollar was down against the
Japanese yen but up against most European currencies. The dollar
fell 0.60 yen to 150.00 yen in Tokyo but was quoted in London at
150.15 yen. It slipped again in New York, closing at 149.90. The
U.S. currency rose against the German mark, the British pound and
the Swiss franc.
   Elsewhere, gold prices were mostly lower. On the Commodity
Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at
$383.20 a troy ounce, down $1.30 from Tuesday.

   Atlantic Richfield Co. on Wednesday froze
wholesale fuel prices for one week, the first oil company to
respond to President Bush's call for restraint during the Middle
East crisis.
   Other big oil companies said they already are practicing
restraint and denied widespread allegations they have been using
instability in the Persian Gulf as an excuse to gouge consumers at
the gas pump.
   Exxon Corp. said it would continue pricing its products ``in a
responsible manner that reflects overall market supply
conditions.'' The world's largest oil company said it buys 2.7
million barrels of oil daily and ``must compete on world markets
and pay world market prices.
   Arco, the eighth-largest U.S. oil company, said its freeze
affects prices of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Arco also said it
was encouraging its dealers, who by federal law set their own pump
prices, to avoid increases.
   Bush earlier Wednesday asked oil companies ``to do their fair
share'' in holding down gas prices, which have risen more than 16
cents a gallon at the pump since Iraq invaded Kuwait last Thursday.
   ``We hope the market will stabilize during this time, but if at
the end the week our position is out of line with world market
prices we will have to recognize that fact,'' George Babikian,
president of Arco Products Co., the company's refining and
marketing division, said in a statement.
   ``We will not raise our prices even then unless we are
substantially below the general market,'' he said. ``Otherwise, if
we remain below the market we risk a run on our stations which
could drain our supply and create a panic buying situation in the
marketplace.''
   Arco operates 1,700 stations in Arizona, California, Nevada,
Oregon and Washington. Arco gets most of its crude from Alaska, but
the cost of its oil still reflects world market prices.
   The American Automobile Association said Wednesday the price of
self-service regular unleaded gasoline rose an average 3.6 cents a
gallon nationwide overnight to $1.237 a gallon, for a rise of 16.2
cents since Aug. 1.
   Other oil companies said they supported Bush's call for
restraint, but blamed market forces for rising prices and said they
had behaved fairly.
   ``While we have raised prices, to date we have recovered only a
fraction of the higher costs incurred,'' Mobil Corp. Chairman Allen
E. Murray said in a letter to Bush.
   Mobil also planned advertisements headlined ``Where's the
Rip-off?'' stating its position on the editorial pages of
Thursday's New York Times and later this week in several other
publications.
   ``Restraint has been a longstanding policy at Texaco,'' that
company said. ``We have been doing so and we fully intend to
continue exercising restraint in gasoline prices.''
   Executives said crude oil prices had increased much faster than
gas prices in the last month. Some attacked recent allegations of
price gouging by politicians and consumer groups as opportunistic
and unfair.
   Already bruised by bad public relations after the Exxon Valdez
oil spill, oil companies also had to contend with revived memories
of profiteering allegations that followed the 1973 Arab oil embargo.
   Oil companies frequently have been criticized since gasoline
prices soared from about 39 cents a gallon in 1973 to 53 cents a
year later following the Arab oil embargo. Prices climbed to nearly
69 cents by 1978, before surging above $1 when Iranian supplies
were cut off by its 1979 revolution deposing the regime of U.S.
ally the Shah.
   More recently, the industry came under attack when prices jumped
after the Exxon Valdez spill off the Alaska coast last year and
heating oil skyrocketed during a December freeze. Despite
allegations, no profiteering or collusion by companies was proven.
   ``The Sun Co. is not recovering its costs at the present time,''
Robert McClements, chairman and chief executive of the
Philadelphia-based oil company, said in an interview.
   ``Unfortunately we are in an election year and there is a
temptation on the part of many of those in the political arena who,
in the desire for public exposure, thrash out one more time at the
oil industry,'' he said.
   Amoco Oil Co. said the price it charges gasoline dealers has
increased about 10 cents a gallon in the last week, compared with
20 cents on ``spot'' oil markets for immediately fuel delivery.
   But the Chicago company said ``the market system of supply and
demand and open competition in petroleum pricing can allow for
rapid price increases.''
   ``Supply disruptions at a major company like Amoco could be far
worse for consumers than temporary higher prices,'' it said. ``The
consumer is better served by a market system that reacts and
distributes products efficiently.''
   Several executives said even though it can take up to 90 days
for crude oil to reach the United States from the Middle East,
companies usually pay the market price in effect when it arrives at
the refinery, not the price when it was contracted for.
   They said about 50 percent of crude oil in the United States is
produced from domestic sources, where delivery time is much
shorter. Also, large amounts of gasoline are purchased on often
volatile ``spot'' markets. Finally, as with other commodities,
market prices can rise immediately as companies seek to cover
future replacement costs.

   The ``Jail Neil Bush'' posters have sprouted
around town, making their way from the bohemian side streets of
Dupont Circle to the broad avenues of the capital's downtown.
   The third son of George and Barbara Bush has become, literally,
the poster boy of the nation's savings and loan scandal, his
patrician face plastered on lamp posts in a parody of an FBI
``Wanted'' handbill. His family name, which catapulted him into the
altitudes of wealth and power in Denver five years ago, now has
thrown him into the vortex of public controversy.
   In August 1985, with scant banking experience behind him, Neil
Bush joined the board of directors of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association, a Denver thrift that went bust three years
later at a cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   Now Bush stands accused by thrift regulators of conflict of
interest for not disclosing business links to big Silverado
borrowers _ he denies any wrongdoing. He also could be a target of
a negligence lawsuit that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
considering filing against him and other Silverado directors.
   Federal investigators are looking into thousands of cases of S&amp;L
fraud and mismanagement, and scores of similar lawsuits could be
filed by the FDIC. But Neil Bush's case is different. As a symbol
of the thrift crisis, he could become a political liability for his
father and the Republican Party in a $500-billion campaign issue.
   Neil Mallon Bush, born on Jan. 22, 1955, was recently described
by the president as ``probably the most sensitive of the four boys,
maybe the second-most sensitive'', ``a good kid.'' His childhood
problems with dyslexia inspired his mother's avid interest in
reading programs.
   He was 30 years old when he joined the Silverado board _ a
tender age to assume such a position of trust at a federally
insured institution. Only 1 percent of all savings and loan
directors were under 35 in 1988, according to a survey by the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions. The average age of a thrift
director was 57.
   Bush's only work in banking before becoming a Silverado director
was a summer job at Republic National Bank in Dallas. ``I worked in
the trust department filling out forms,'' he told regulators in a
closed hearing last December.
   The regulators have asserted Bush was ``unqualified and
untrained'' to be a savings and loan director _ although that
doesn't excuse him, they said.
   Flashback to the heady days of the oil industry in the American
West in the early 1980s. The Iranian oil cutoff in 1979 had spawned
skyrocketing prices and long, aggravating waits in gasoline lines
at home.
   The rugged oil fields of Colorado and Wyoming, which overnight
had become economic to develop, were gripped by a gold rush fever.
Suddenly, it seemed, everyone was in the oil business. Legions of
brash entrepreneurs swept into town, eager to take risks and get a
piece of the action.
   Neil Bush was one of them. He came to Denver armed with a
bachelor's degree and an MBA, both from Tulane University in New
Orleans, and some experience working in his father's 1980
presidential campaign and his brother George's unsuccessful bid for
Congress in Texas.
   In the summer of 1980, Bush was hired as a landman by Amoco
Production Co. in Denver, negotiating oil leases.
   ``Neil was very, very tough,'' said Tom Vessels, a Denver oilman
who negotiated lease deals with Bush. He also was ``all-round
curious,'' asking more questions than most landmen, recalled
Vessels, who owns a small oil company bearing his name and is
president of the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain
States.
   Few others in what's now left of the Rockies oil industry seem
to remember Bush. That's not surprising, since there were scores of
small independent oilmen in the region in those days.
   ``I've never known anybody who's dealt with him in the oil
business,'' said Bill Owens, executive director of the Colorado
Petroleum Association.
   Bush left Amoco in late 1982 and set up an oil partnership with
two geologists called JNB Exploration Co. For an investment of only
$100, Bush acquired 23.4 percent of the business.
   For two years, JNB drilled a succession of dry holes in
Wyoming's Powder River Basin and failed to become profitable.
   That was common in those days. What was unusual, oilmen say, was
how Bush's ``silent'' partners kept pumping money into the business
despite its track record.
   The fact that Bush was a son of the vice president likely had
something to do with that. His silent partners in JNB _ wealthy
Denver developers Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters _ probably
reckoned they might get more than oil from the millions of dollars
they invested in Bush's company.
   Influence and connections can often be as valuable as money to
people like Good and Walters, who were already heavy borrowers from
high-flying Silverado when Bush joined the board.
   Michael R. Wise, the chairman of Silverado at the time, also
knew the value of connections. He was on the board of the U.S.
League, the S&amp;L industry's main lobbying group, and had personal
contacts with regulators.
   In mid-1985, Wise invited Bush to join the board of Silverado,
which was at the zenith of its go-go period.
   Silverado was making huge loans for grandiose real estate
schemes right and left, though many of the ventures were never
finished. The thrift was a gold mine for fast-and-loose developers,
since it was playing with depositors' money that was insured by the
federal government.
   Good and Walters, two of the biggest borrowers, got a combined
$117 million in loans that they never repaid. The leading borrower,
Bell Savings and Loan Association of San Mateo, Calif., got $124.8
million. Its chairman at the time, David Butler, pleaded guilty
last year to loan fraud and was sentenced to two years in prison.
   ``Management of Silverado took excessive risks, engaged in
abusive or questionable practices to generate short-term gains and
undertook innovative manipulations to avoid recording losses,'' the
Office of Thrift Supervision said in a report published last May.
``The board did little beyond rubber stamping the activities of
(Silverado's) sophisticated, bright and manipulative management
team.''
   As a director, Bush voted to approve loans _ including some of
the projects sponsored by Good and Walters. The regulators have
accused him of conflict of interest in not disclosing to Silverado
his links with the two developers through JNB.
   Bush denies the allegations. He concedes, however, that his
family ties helped him get the Silverado position.
   ``I would be naive if I were to sit here and deny that the Bush
name didn't have something to do with it,'' he said in a recent
interview with Time magazine. ``Maybe the advantage of being part
of the vice president's family at the time was that I was accepted
more quickly in terms of age and years in this community (Denver)
than others of my peer group.''
   The family name, however, has become a double-edged sword.
Because he is the president's son, Bush has captured the public
imagination more than any other player in the national S&amp;L drama.
The unsigned ``Jail Neil Bush'' posters haven't reached Main
Street, but across the country, Neil Bush's face is now recognized
by many of the taxpayers who will have to shell out $2,000 each to
cover thrift losses.

   Soaring oil prices aren't expected to
create any abrupt increases in coal prices, but experts agree the
coal industry could receive a much needed boost if oil prices
remain high.
   ``I think you're very unlikely to see any massive switching
(from oil to coal),'' said John Gresser of the National Coal
Association. But he said the industry is in a good position to
increase production if other countries move from oil to coal.
   Coal prices have remained fairly stable at $22 to $26 a ton in
recent months because of intense domestic and foreign competition,
experts said.
   Gresser said coal doesn't compete directly with oil, so a rise
in oil prices has little effect on coal.
   And he said U.S. utilities cannot quickly switch from burning
oil to burning coal in power plants.
   But experts said more plants in European can be converted, and
there, the sale of coal may increase.
   ``We could see maybe a jump in (European) demand from 3 million
to 6 million tons,'' Wyn Holbrock of the A.T. Massey Coal Co. in
Richmond, Va., told the Charleston Daily Mail.
   Japanese plants can also switch from oil to coal, analysts said.
   ``In Europe and the Far East, there is a distinct possibility
over a longer trend of time that the price of coal as an exporter
would be impacted,'' said Mark Cohen, a coal analyst for Kidder,
Peabody and Co.
   Wayne T. Ewing, president of Peabody Development Co. and
chairman of the National Coal Association, said the demand for coal
exports will be greater if the oil crisis continues, especially
because prices are soon to be negotiated for next year.
   ``If this thing continues to escalate, it will have some effect
here in the U.S.,'' Ewing said.
   The experts said oil prices must continue to remain high,
however, before the U.S. coal industry will see major results.
   ``High oil prices must stick around for a long time with
implications of no improvement,'' said Rafael Villagran, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   If some utilities do switch to coal, they can be assured of a
large supply, Gresser said. He said 1 billion tons of coal will be
produced this year and the coal industry can easily increase
production.
   ``After the last oil embargo, people thought there would be more
of a demand for coal,'' Gresser said. ``Many people purchased coal
mines and that capacity is still there to meet any sort of
increased demands.''
   But Villagren cautioned that an increased European demand for
coal does not necessarily help U.S. coal producers.
   ``The U.S. has stiff competition from the Australians and the
Far East,'' he said.

<HEAD>Market Makes a Comeback Amid Bargain Hunting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market rebounded Wednesday as
investors hunted for bargains among the issues battered during Wall
Street's recent weak spell.
   A retreat in oil prices eased inflation anxieties, contributing
to an improved attitude toward stocks.
   Also, a perception that tensions in the Middle East might be
diffused without prolonged difficulty helped stabilize shaky
investor confidence and encouraged renewed buying.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials snapped a string of six
straight losing sessions and advanced 24.26 to 2,734.90.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by better than 5 to
3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 1,015 up, 601 down and 406 unchanged.
   Trading activity slowed from the brisk pace of recent days.
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 190.40 million shares,
down from 231.58 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 237.91 million shares.
   ``A lot of stocks looked like real bargains,'' said Hugh
Johnson, investment strategist at First Albany Corp. ``There were
plenty of stocks that were either dirt cheap or, at a minium,
undervalued.''
   Some buying enthusiasm was suppressed by concerns that financial
markets still are vulnerable to shocks from the Middle East.
   The full economic implications of the turmoil caused by Iraq's
invasion and subsequent occupation of Kuwait are unknown. There has
been speculation, however, that the struggling U.S. economy could
be pushed into recession.
   Market analysts said the U.S. decision to send troops to Saudi
Arabia, in what President Bush emphasized was a defensive role,
deterred speculation that the crisis would worsen.
   The slide in petroleum prices sparked a selloff in energy
stocks. The contract for September delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, pulled back by
$2.35 to $25.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among the blue chip oil stocks, Chevron dropped 1~ to 76~, Exxon
tumbled 1| to 51} and Texaco fell 1} to 62}.
   The retreat in oil prices gave a lift to transportation stocks,
particularly airline issues. The Dow Jones transportation average
rose 26.64 to 991.42, posting its first gain since July 25.
   Woolworth, which reported a 4.2 percent increase in its
second-quarter income, climbed 1{ to 28~.
   Several other retailing stocks joined Woolworth in moving
higher. Wal-Mart added 1| to 30\, department store operator Dillard
jumped 4\ to 84\ and May Department Stores moved { higher to 44.
   Disney surged 4| to 108 while MCA gained 1{ to 47 and CBS
advanced 6} to 176. Speculation circulated in the market that
Disney might be preparing for a major acquisition.
   Actively traded blue chips included: Philip Morris, up &rsqb; to 45|;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, off &rsqb; to 35; Boeing, up 1 to 53;
International Business Machines, up &lsqb; to 103&lsqb;; General Electric, up
| to 67~; Eastman Kodak, up 1&lsqb; to 41&lsqb;; and McDonald's, up &rsqb; to 30&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $27.68 billion, or 0.87
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.95 to 185.40.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index went up 3.86 to 398.96, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index ended at 338.35, up 3.52.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
increased 5.65 to 407.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 340.03, up 0.19.

<HEAD>Gold Falters, Copper Gains As Oil Price Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices fell Wednesday and copper futures climbed as
a downturn in oil prices prompted an abrupt change in speculation
about the economy.
   On other commodity markets, pork futures fell sharply; cattle
extended their gains; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $1.20 to
$1.50 lower with the contract for delivery in August at $383.20 a
troy ounce; silver futures finished 1.5 cents to 1.8 cents lower
with August at $4.843 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures ended 2 cents to 3.65 cents higher on the
Commodity Exchange with August at $1.31 a pound.
   The moves reflected a shift away from the inflation and
recession fears that began building late last week, when Iraq
invaded Kuwait and touched off a runup in oil prices and a plunge
in stock prices worldwide.
   The gold market responds quickly to inflation fears because the
metal is perceived as an investment hedge against inflation. Copper
is used heavily throughout the construction and manufacturing
industries, so its price is especially sensitive to signs of
economic expansion or recession.
   Economy jitters eased Wednesday as the price of crude oil fell
and the U.S. stock market rebounded, partly in reaction to the
movement of U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia to defend against Iraqi
threats to oil-producing nations beyond Kuwait.
   Analysts said word that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other major
oil-producing nations would increase their output also worked to
suppress crude prices.
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena urged members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries to avoid such ``individual
intiatives.''
   But Tom Bentz, director of trading with United Energy Inc., said
OPEC is likely to cooperate with the cartel's customers.
   ``It's not in their best interest to let prices go to $35 or $40
a barrel, because then people start looking for alternative sources
of energy,'' Bentz said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 83 cent to
$2.35 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange with the September
contract at $25.96 a barrel; heating oil was 2.46 cents to 5.01
cents lower with September at 70.13 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 2.13 cents to 3.8 cents lower with September at 76.21
cents a gallon.
   Pork futures plummeted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
reflecting seasonal factors and a bulge in hog production.
   ``We've had a year of good profitability in the hog market and
we're beginning to see the results in increased slaughter,'' said
Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington
Heights, Ill.
   Most hog contracts and some belly contracts fell their permitted
daily limits of 1.5 cents and 2 cents, respectively.
   Live hogs finished 1.22 to 1.5 cents lower with August at 56.57
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .32 cent to 2 cents lower
with August at 50.75 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures rose moderately, extending strong gains posted
Tuesday that were linked to a better economic outlook and strong
cash markets.
   Live cattle futures ended .02 cent to .23 cent higher with
August at 78 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to
.28 cent higher with August at 89.95 cents a pound.
   Wheat futures rose modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade
following news of export sales of the grain and speculation that
more such sales may be in the works. Corn and soybean futures edged
lower.
   Sales of U.S. wheat to Egypt, Mexico and Algeria were confirmed
Wednesday, said Katharina Zimmer, grain analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc.
   She said the market also was supported by Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter's statement at a news conference that he hopes to
see an increase in subsidized export sales of U.S. wheat.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 3} cents higher with September at
$2.84{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents lower to { cent higher with
September at $1.17\ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cent to 3 cents
lower with August at $5.93\ a bushel.

<HEAD>Trump Documents Ordered Released, Trump Lawyers Get Stay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey regulators ruled Wednesday that
more than 1,000 pages of documents detailing Donald Trump's
financial rescue package must be made public, but they still
remained secret while his lawyers appeal the decision.
   The Casino Control Commission, which must approve the plan
involving Trump's three Atlantic City casinos, said the release
would not constitute an unwarranted invasion of Trump's private
business dealings. The public's interest in casino operations takes
precedence over Trump's desire to keep his business affairs
private, the commission ruled.
   The commission is expected to hold a public hearing on the
restructuring plan within the next month.
   Trump lawyer Joseph Fusco argued that the documents contain
sensitive financial information, much of which has nothing to do
with his casino holdings. He also argued the arrangement with the
banks has not yet been made final, and the release of information
could jeopardize negotiations.
   Fusco obtained a delay and will appear before Superior Court
Jude Arnold Stein Thursday in Morristown in his effort to reverse
the commission's ruling.
   Only one document, Trump's application to the commission for
approval of the financial package, was released before Trump's
lawyers obtained the legal delay.
   Commission Chairwoman Valerie Armstrong said it was virtually
impossible to understand that document without examining the host
of other financial reports.
   The application appeared to shed little new light on Trump's
financial arrangement with nine banks to make ends meet over the
next three to five years.
   It reports that Trump will receive a $65 million line of credit
and will be able to defer about $85 million in annual interest
payments for between three and five years.
   Under the agreement, Trump for the first time is using his
casinos as collateral for financial assistance. The agreement with
the banks will restructure about $1 billion of his $1.3 billion
casino debt and $1.9 billion in other debts.
   In exchange for providing the fresh credit, Trump's rescuers
have gained some control over his holdings and will closely monitor
his personal and business dealings for years to come. The agreement
also requires him to appoint a senior executive officer to oversee
his operations.
   Sources have reported that the $65 million bailout and debt
restructuring package also requires Trump to sell assets to raise
cash, but the document released Wednesday did not refer to the sale
of assets.
   Trump has discussed selling his Trump Shuttle and the Trump
Princess, the 282-foot yacht he bought for $30 million.
   Trump has confirmed in the past that the agreement limits his
household and personal spending to $450,000 a month for the rest of
this year.
   The banks hope that by deferring about half of his $2 billion
bank debt for up to five years, Trump will gain time to sell his
assets in an orderly way.
   The document released Wednesday also says the restructuring will
protect the Trump casinos from claims by creditors and will not
affect the payment terms of the casino indebtedness.
   The three casinos, and their indebtedness, are Trump Taj Mahal,
$725 million; Trump Plaza, $275 million; and Trump's Castle Hotel
and Casino, $402 million.
   The documents were public information for about two hours, but
commission officials refused to allow reporters to see the
material, saying copies were being made. About two hours later, and
after only one of the one less important documents had been copied
and released, Trump's lawyers obtained the legal delay.

   Entertainment giant Thorn EMI said Wednesday it
had added 90,000 titles to its vast catalogue of classic songs by
paying 61.5 million pounds, or about $115 million, for a music
publishing company.
   The acquisition of British-based Filmtrax and its U.S.
subsidiary, Filmtrax Copyright Holdings, means Thorn EMI now owns
the rights to music from many top Broadway shows, Hollywood
musicals and pop songs like ``Stormy Weather'' and ``Itsy Bitsy
Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.''
   Thorn EMI's catalogue contained 600,000 titles before its latest
buy, which will add considerably to the company's earning power.
   Film scores include those from ``Tootsie,'' ``Ghostbusters'' and
``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' as well as jazz greats like
``Stardust'' by Hoagy Carmichael, Fats Waller's ``Ain't
Misbehavin''' and ``Sophisticated Lady'' by Duke Ellington.
   Colin Southgate, Thorn EMI chairman and chief executive, said of
the new acquisition, ``It will extend the success already achieved
... making us the world's pre-eminent music publishing company.''

<HEAD>Flint Strike Could Hamper Other Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLINT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees walked off the job at a General
Motors Corp. parts plant Wednesday in a strike GM officials said
could shut down other assembly plants.
   The walkout at GM's AC Rochester Division Flint West plant came
after negotiations on employee grievances about health and safety
issues broke off about 9:25 a.m., said Duane Zuckschwerdt, a United
Auto Workers union bargainer.
   ``Hopefully, it won't be a long strike,'' Zuckschwerdt said.
   ``We're obviously disappointed,'' said GM President Lloyd Reuss,
reached at a meeting at Traverse City.
   Reuss estimated that the walkout could force production cuts or
shutdowns at six to eight assembly plants. He declined to identify
which plants could be affected, but said, ``I would expect the
assembly plants to be impacted in the next two to three days.''
   With a typical assembly plant employing 5,000 people or more,
the numbers of employees affected could be in the tens of
thousands, GM spokesman John Maciarz said.
   The strike would affect other plants that rely on just-in-time
delivery of parts made at the plant in Flint. Under the
just-in-time system, such parts as gas tanks, van doors and grilles
are shipped as needed rather than kept in storage.
   ``There are no big warehouses out in back any more,'' Maciarz
said.
   If the strike at the 2,800-employee Flint complex isn't
resolved, he said, ``Certainly a large number of our assembly
operations would be impacted, and other supplier divisions would be
impacted because of not being able to send parts to assembly
plants. By Monday, anyway, we would begin to see an impact.''
   Maciarz said GM negotiators were ready to continue talks with
the union, but he didn't know when they might resume.
   Zuckschwerdt said bargainers from UAW Local 659, representing
the AC Rochester workers, and GM had met until 8:40 p.m. Tuesday
and reconvened at 6 a.m. Wednesday.
   Because the impact would spread rapidly to other plants and
other employees, the local is under pressure not only from GM but
from other UAW locals, said David Cole, director of the Office for
the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of
Michigan.
   Reuss wouldn't speculate on whether the Flint walkout would have
any impact on national contract talks going on between the Big
Three automakers and the UAW. ``You don't want to read too much
into this,'' he said.
   He said GM will be pressing for a settlement because its car
inventories are at their lowest point since the early 1980s.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy was slackening well before
higher oil prices following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait threatened
to push it closer to a recession, the Federal Reserve reported
Wednesday.
   While a survey of the 12 Fed districts found the nation's
economy continuing to grow, ``most noted that the pace was slow or
had slackened recently,'' the central bank said in releasing its
Beige Book, a periodic economic assessment.
   Many economists fear higher energy costs could shock an already
soft economy into recession.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday predicted that even
without higher energy costs, the economy would grind to a
standstill during the current quarter and then fall into a
recession starting in the fourth quarter.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta completed the survey July 27
for use at the Aug. 21 meeting of the central bank's Federal Open
Market Committee.
   The committee, which establishes U.S. monetary policy, adopted a
tight credit policy more than a year ago to slow the economy and
lessen inflationary pressures. But as evidence of a weakening
economy mounted even before the Middle East eruption, many
officials and economists were calling for a looser grip to
stimulate growth.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Wednesday he and
President Bush want the Fed give economic growth a boost by
lowering interest rates, saying strong growth is particularly
important as the United States responds to Iraq's invasion.
   ``Everybody wants lower interest rates. ... At this point in
time in the United States, economic growth is very important,'' he
said told a news conference.
   Meanwhile, the chairman of the President's Council on Economic
Advisers said it was too soon to forecast accurately the potential
effects of recent oil price increases on the nation's economy.
   ``It could be significant and it could be modest,'' Michael
Boskin said in Traverse City, Mich., while attending a management
seminar. ``For the kinds of price increases we've seen thus far
it's likely that the economy would be able to absorb them.''
   But he said if the price of crude oil settles in a $25 to $28 a
barrel range as has been estimated, it would shave 0.5 to 0.7
percentage points off of increases in the gross national product
and would add one percentage point to the consumer price index.
   ``Then the inflation rate would drift back down,'' he said.
   The Commerce Department reported the economy grew at a meager
1.2 percent annual rate in the quarter ending June 30 and just 1.7
percent in the previous three-month period. Another sign of a
slowing economy came last Friday when the Labor Department reported
unemployment rose to 5.5 percent, the highest level in two years.
   While the Fed's latest survey found sluggish growth continuing
in the third quarter, it also indicated inflation was not subsiding.
   It said wages in some districts were rising between 3 percent
and 5 percent, in most cases excluding benefits. At the same time,
some districts reported widespread price increases while other said
businesses were having to absorb higher costs at the expense of
profit margins.
   ``Retail sales were generally described as a little better than
a year ago or soft, with weaker-than-expected demand for big-ticket
items cited most often,'' the survey said.
   ``Retailers in New York City are less optimistic about the
outlook given the continuing layoffs at banks and brokerage firms,
while those in St. Louis expressed similar views in light of
anticipated defense cutbacks,'' it added.
   Residential real estate construction and sales were below their
1989 pace, often because of high inventories which in many cases
caused falling prices, the survey found. The soft housing industry
also was causing weak sales of home furnishings and appliances.
   Overall manufacturing activity was flat, the survey found,
although it varied from industry to industry.
   Demand for domestic steel was up, partly due to auto production.
At the same time, the survey found vehicle sales either flat or
below year-ago levels.
   But with the exception of steel and commercial aircraft,
manufacturing inventories and lead times were said to be slowing.
   Most districts also reported employment was either flat or
likely to weaken based on announced layoffs.
   ``Several districts report that the pace of commercial loan
growth has recently slowed and some indicate that its levels are
below those of a year ago,'' the survey found.
   Lending to consumers also was off, but not to the extent of
commercial loans.
   The survey found the outlook for agricultural production
generally good, although poor weather conditions were hurting crops
in some areas.

<HEAD>American Airlines to Hike Fares 10 Percent Because of Fuel Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines said Wednesday it
would raise fares by 10 percent because of skyrocketing fuel costs
resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Michael W. Gunn, the airline's senior vice president for
marketing, said the increase will go into effect Friday for flights
in the continental United States, Hawaii and the Caribbean and on
Aug. 15 for international flights.
   ``We regret the recent events in the Middle East have caused a
significant increase in fuel prices, leading to the need to
increase air fares,'' Gunn said.
   Delta Air Lines, based in Atlanta, said it would not raise fares
immediately, but said increases were likely.
   ``Travelers who can confirm their plans might be well advised to
make their reservations and purchase tickets now,'' Whit Hawkins,
Delta's senior vice president for marketing said in a press release.
   In recent days, Pan American World Airways and Northwest
Airlines said they would raise their fares because of soaring fuel
costs.
   Every one-cent increase in the price per gallon of jet fuel adds
more than $2 million a month to the airline's costs, Smith said.
American Airlines uses more than 200 million gallons of jet fuel
each month, American Airlines spokesman Tim said.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stock Prices Move Lower in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen in early
trading Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
lost moderately.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues lost 113.80 points, or 0.39 percent, moving to 28,395.34 in
the first 15 minutes of trading. The index gained 856.07 points on
Wednesday.
   The dollar started trading at 149.50 yen, down 0.50 yen from
Wednesday's close of 150.00 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's retreat was carried over from
New York trading, where the currency finished at 149.90 yen, down
from 150.90 yen on Tuesday.
   Kan Sugita, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said that although
the dollar moved slightly in early trading, ``many market players
are very nervous'' over uncertainties about Middle East.
   Sugita said the market did not show ``immediate' reaction to
U.S. President George Bush's announcement Wednesday that he has
sending U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia to guard the world's largest
oil-producing country against a possible attack by Iraq.
   ``People wanted to take a wait-and-see position to see whether
there's any military clash'' with Iraq, Sugita said.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slipped to 7.910 percent from Wednesday's
close of 7.915 percent. Their price edged up to 83.82 points from
83.80 points.

<HEAD>UAL Board Extends Deadline to Obtain Financing in Buyout Attempt</HEAD>

A man ..., to UPDATE with analyst comment; minor editing

   United Airlines' parent company Wednesday gave an
employee buyout group an extra two months to arrange financing for
its $4.38 billion bid.
   UAL Corp.'s board of directors said it was willing to extend the
deadline, which was due to expire Thursday, because of the crisis
in the Middle East.
   The buyout group ``reported that the recent turmoil in the world
oil markets had slowed the progress of its discussions with
financing sources,'' UAL said in a statement Wednesday evening
after a regular meeting of the directors.
   The company said, however, that if financing is not arranged by
the new deadline, Oct. 9, UAL will terminate the buyout agreement
it reached with United Airlines employees last April.
   The directors indicated that they had doubts about the effort's
chances of success.
   ``UAL emphasized that especially in light of events in the
Middle East, state of the financial markets and softening economy,
there can be no assurance that a transaction can be completed,''
the statement said.
   There was no immediate comment from the United Employee
Acquisition Corp., the group formed to buy UAL.
   A man who answered the telephone at the group's office, but
refused to give his name, said there would be no comment Wednesday.
   Samuel Buttrick, a stock market analyst who follows UAL for
Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in New York, said the Middle East crisis had
exacerbated trouble the group was already having obtaining
financing.
   The buyout group got a boost earlier in teh day when the Los
Angeles banking company Security Pacific Corp. said it had joined
two New York banks in loan talks with the employees.
   Some industry analysts have speculated the employees would
restructure or reduce their $201-per-share offer, which UAL's board
accepted April 6.
   The UAL statement said the directors had instructed its advisers
to engage in further discussions with the employee group ``to
explore any changes in financial structure that may be necessary to
obtain financing.''
   Company spokesman Robert Doughty would not elaborate.
   Earlier Wednesday, UAL stock recovered some ground it had lost
in trading during the last couple weeks.
   Analysts said the rally in UAL's stock after a plunge of 38
percent in less than two weeks stemmed mainly from Wednesday's
sharp drop in oil prices.
   UAL's stock rose $13.50 to $114.50 a share Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   UAL's stock tumbled from $163 to $101 a share in the seven
business days ending Tuesday amid waning investor confidence that
the deal would get done.
   Much of the skepticism was prompted by the withdrawal of three
large New York banks _ Chase Manhattan Corp., Chemical Banking
Corp. and Citicorp _ from a five-bank group that had begun loan
talks with the buyout group.
   The two remaining banks, Bankers Trust New York Corp. and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., have been joined by Security Pacific,
said Penny Maines, a spokeswoman for the California bank.
   The employees also have asked some of UAL's suppliers, including
aircraft maker Boeing Co. and engine builder General Electric Co.,
to invest in the deal.

<HEAD>Upscale Retail Stores Cuts Workforce by 10 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharper Image Corp., an upscale retail
company that sells unique high-technology goods, on Wednesday
announced a 10 percent cutback in its nationwide workforce.
   The layoffs of about 110 of the company's 1,100 workers included
corporate and store employees, said Jennifer Grellman, vice
president of marketing for Sharper Image.
   ``The corporate office cutbacks began today and the cutbacks in
the stores began last Friday,'' Grellman said. ``But we did give
severance packages to the employees absolutely. And we also had an
outplacement program. We tried to be as humane as we could.''
   The layoffs come as the retail industry suffers from reduced
sales. Grellman said Sharper Image saw its first losses during the
second quarter of this year _ .15 to .20 cents per share. That
compared to earnings per share of .01 cents during the same quarter
the previous year.
   Grellman said the company is predicting profits during the
fourth quarter of this year.
   Sharper Image has 70 stores in about two dozen states, mostly in
the West and East, and it has international outlets through eight
foreign licensees.
