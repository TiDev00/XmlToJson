<HEAD>Study Shows up to Half of Vietnamese Children Malnourished</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national survey has found that up to
50 percent of Vietnam's children are malnourished, according to the
official Vietnam News Agency reports.
   Fifteen percent of the malnutrition cases are serious or very
serious, says the recent government survey of nearly 13,000
households in 20 provinces and cities, the agency reported Monday.
   It said the survey found that 62 percent of men and 38 percent
of women were underweight.
   The study said the average Vietnamese had the world's highest
rate of rice consumption, but the diet lacked sufficient protein,
fat, vitamins and minerals.
   Vietnam's economy is one of the world's poorest, and the
majority of its 65 million people work the land. The economy was
hurt by rigid communism until recent reforms, and by a Western aid
embargo after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   There are clear signs the reforms have produced good results.
   Vietnam has harvested its second good rice crop in a row, and
its target of producing some 22 million tons of food this year is
attainable, the Vietnam News Agency said. It said farmers reaped
nearly 12 million tons of rice in the summer and autumn harvests,
up by 400,000 tons from last year.
   The report also said inflation ``remains under control''
although it continued at 3.3 percent per month during this year's
first three quarters.

<HEAD>Mail For Troops Clogged By Well-Wishers, But Help Is At Hand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Along with the bullets, guns and
food the military needs to wage war, there's a precious commodity
that links the troops in Saudi Arabia to home - the mail, 70 tons a
day of it.
   But the system's becoming clogged with boxes of cookies, books,
newspapers and letters to ``any soldier'' from stateside
well-wishers, courtesy of ``Dear Abby'' campaigns and drives by
churches and schools.
   With Christmas around the corner, it's going to get wrse.
   ``I think we're getting so much of it that it bogs down the mail
from loved ones,'' said Sgt. J.W. Allen, postmaster for the 1st
Tactical Fighter Wing.
   ``We're getting to the point of maximum utilization. We're
constantly filling up,'' said Air Force Capt. Philip Jewitt at the
military's main sorting center. ``To be honest, I don't know
anybody who'd rather get a newspaper in exchange for a loved one's
letter.''
   But, with Christmas in mind, reinforcements are on the way.
   Maj. Gen. William Pagonis, who heads the Army Support Command
for Operation Desert Shield, said he plans to activate two more
reserve postal units to help the four units, not counting
volunteers, now carrying the mail. That will boost the total of
people working in the mail system to 450.
   ``We're handling 70 tons a day. That's killing us. The United
States is going super-patriotic,'' said Pagonis.
   ``It wouldn't be fair to say the system doesn't have some
problems. We're improving conditions every day,'' he said. ``When
was the U.S. Army ever set up across miles of desert?''
   Pagonis is aiming for a delivery time of less than 10 days for
letters or packages for troops in the desert.
   Soldiers are sending four tons of mail back home every day,
officers said.
   Some troops are getting so many old newspapers, books and
cookies from well-meaning strangers that they send them back from
the desert to the mail room, said Staff Sgt. Russ Lewis of Newark,
Calif.
   ``We'll try to throw them on the trucks, but a lot of people
don't want them,'' he said.
   However taxed the system is, Pagonis says the letter-writing
campaigns are not interfering with keeping the fighting men
supplied with essential needs.
   ``I never allow mail to interupt supply. I'm not going to let
that happen. Supplies get priority,'' he said.
   ``I know the mail's just as important to the troops ... When I
see the mail interrupting something, I put more guys on supply.''
   And the general's not about to ask for a slowdown in the ``Dear
Abby'' and other volunteer operations.
   ``For the one soldier who gets that letter, it's going to be
worth it,'' Pagonis said.
   One Marine was tickled to get 300 birthday cards from the
students at R.W. Kershaw School in Mount Ephraim, N.J.
   ``At least we know somebody's thinking about us,'' said Cpl.
Dominic Guinto, of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 1st
Marine Expeditionary Force. He'll celebrate his 21st birthday on
Nov. 1 - in the desert.
   Meanwhile, supply lines that stretch 12,000 miles back to the
United States are working at full throttle.
   The total tonnage is unavailabe, but the system has unloaded
42,000 pieces of equipment, ammunition pallets and food crates from
101 ships and 677 air force transports in 80 days.
   ``That's probably unheard of in history,'' said Pagonis, who has
6,000 soldiers under his command. ``In Vietnam, it took five or six
years to have this many troops on the ground. We've done it in 80
days.''
   Until now, cargo has been limited to everything that is combat
essential. Now, supply ships are bringing in spare parts,
stockpiles of ammunition, recreation gear, things that make living
in the desert a little easier. That includes winter gear such as
sweaters and space heaters because the temperatures are beginning
to cool.
   ``There's been no chokepoint at this time,'' Pagonis said. ``We
have fresh fruit in every foxhole.''
   But some in the field worry that the desert grit is taking its
toll on tanks, trucks and helicopters as soldiers train for war.
   ``We're going through so many parts right now while they're
doing their exercises that my biggest concern, if the real thing
happens, is rnning out of parts,'' said Sgt. Charles Owen, 35, of
Mobile, Ala., who works in the Marine Combat Service Support
Detachment.
   ``There's usually equipment going down every day. It takes a lot
to get it going again,'' Owen said.
   What's important is to stockpile critical parts, said Col. Alex
Powell, commanding officer of the Marines' Direct Support Group.
   ``Instead of just ordering a part that happens to go bad, like a
starter on a tank, we'll assume that we've got 100 tanks, look at
what's happened so far and say that in 90 days we're going to need
150 of these starters,'' he said.
   Despite gripes about late mail and lack of parts, the troops say
they're well supplied.
   ``Maybe not everything we want, but everything we need,'' said
Maj. John Bates of the 3rd Marine Regiment. Asked what he wanted
that he didn't have, Bates said: ``Beer and ice water.''

   Since the government began tearing down the
Green Line that divides Beirut into Christian and Moslem sectors,
hundreds of people have reunited with long-lost friends or
relatives. Associated Press reporter Mohammed Salam, a Sunni
Moslem, recently tracked down a Christian friend, Nicolas Sayegh.

   Nicolas and I fell into each others' arms
when we met for the first time in 11 years. ``Thank God I survived
to see you alive,'' he said.
   Niclas, a 52-year-old telecommunications employee, and I have
been friends for 22 years. We last saw each other in 1979, when he
was no longer able to cross from Christian east Beirut to the
telecommunications authority in Moslem west Beirut because of
fighting.
   I ventured into east Beirut to find my old pal. When Nicolas
recognized me, he knelt down and kissed the ground in a traditional
gesture of thanks.
   Then he hugged me, choking back sobs, saying: ``I want to be
sure you are not a dream.''
   He introduced me to his wife, Mary, their two daughters and
their son, telling them: ``I want you to meet my Moslem brother.''
   We talked for an hour about the old days, recalling the
girlfriends we had before we got married. And we talked about the
future.
   ``When we knew each other it made no difference whether you were
Moslem and I was Christian,'' Sayegh said. ``Do you think these
barriers that have separated the Lebanese for 15 years will ever be
removed?''
   Our reunion was a scene that has been repeated hundreds of times
in the two weeks since President Elias Hrawi's government began
tearing down the Green Line, the five-mile wall of fortifications
that has divided Beirut during 15{ years of civil war.
   Many Moslem parents are taking their children on tours of the
Christian hinterland north of the capital, a part of Lebanon the
war generation youngsters have never seen.
   The Green Line, the most potent symbol of Lebanon's sectarian
divisions, started coming down after Syrian troops backing Hrawi
crushed rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun to end an 11-month mutiny
against the government.
   In eight hours of fighting on Oct. 13, more than 750 people were
killed. It was the fiercest battle since the war began in April
1975.
   Hrawi is struggling to implement an Arab League-brokered peace
plan. He has already secured the agreement of the main Christian
and Moslem militias to pull out of Beirut and create a
military-free zone.
   Under the peace plan, the Maronites, the main Christian sect
which has dominated politics since independence from France in
1943, will surrender many privileges and share power equally with
the Moslem majority.
   Hrawi's next move will be to disband the militias and absorb
some of their fighters into a reconstituted national army, which
years ago fractured along sectarian lines.
   That will be easier said than done. Sectarian rivalries remain
deep-rooted. Already, Druse Moslem warlord Walid Jumblatt is
trading insults with Christian chieftain Samir Geagea.
   Jumblatt, whose 200,000-strong community is one of the smallest
and therefore vulnerable sects, is also highly critical of the
peace plan.
   Despite Hrawi's advances and the initial euphoria of seeing the
Green Line fall, the Lebanese have been down this road before. They
have seen peace efforts collapse in bloodletting.
   Many Maronites, longtime enemies of Syria, resent the Syrians'
return to east Beirut.
   ``We want the Lebanese army to extend their authority over the
whole of Lebanon,'' said Christian saleswoman Nancy Khoury. ``We
don't want the Syrians.''
   Aoun's loyalists fear reprisals by Geagea's rapacious
militiamen, who fought the general's forces earlier this year.
   ``Who's going to protect us against Geagea?'' asked Aoun
supporter Raffoul Tayan. ``To the Syrians, we and Geagea's men are
enemies. They won't mind seeing both of us get slaughtered.
   ``I don't feel safe at all,'' said Tayan, 25, a mechanic at a
garage in Hazmiyeh, east of Beirut.
   Marlene Taber, a Christian housewife, compared the situation in
Aoun's former enclave to what happened when Israel invaded Lebanon
in 1982.
   ``When the Israelis came, our Christia militiamen entered
Moslem areas behind them and behaved like conquerers,'' she said.
   ``The Moslems didn't take it for long. They fought back and
peace collapsed,'' Mrs. Taber said. ``Now pro-Syrian militias who
entered our areas are behaving like conquerers. This can't last for
long. Someone will fight back.''
   But many Lebanese are daring to hope that this time it will be
different. They believe that with the Lebanese army strengthened
and the Syrians apparently determined to enforce peace, it could
just work.
   In Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut and much of the Christian
enclave, life is as normal as it has ever been in the last 15
years.
   The value of the Lebanese pound, usually a reliable barometer of
confidence, has recovered nearly 50 percent since Aoun's defeat.
   The currency, which was at 1,200 to the dollar when Iraq invaded
Kuwait Aug. 2, closed at 720 to the dollar on Beirut's money market
late last week.
   Restaurants, casinos, night clubs and entertainment centers are
packed with Lebanese, who have learned to enjoy themselves while
they can.
   Electricity for most of Beirut, which was cut off for nearly two
months, is back three hours a day and government officials hope to
soon restore it completely. City water supplies are trickling back.
   People who once lived near the Green Line are returning to their
homes - or what's left of them.
   ``My house is in ruins. But truly, I'm very happy the war is
over,'' said auto dealer Samir Tabish as he cleaned debris from the
apartment in the Moslem Ras el-Nabeh district that he fled 13 years
ago.
   ``We're dying to move back. But the repairs will cost $15,000
and we don't have that kind of money,'' he said.

<HEAD>Many German Firms Helped Build Iraq's Arsenal</HEAD>

   ``Made in Germany'' appears on much of
Iraq's mighty arsenal, from missiles to poison gas, rocket fuel to
helicopters.
   Six Iraqi poison gas plants were built with German help,
according to an independent report commissioned by German
authorities.
   Other companies allegedly delivered technology and know-how that
helped Iraq upgrade Soviet-made missiles, obtain parts for a
supercannon and acquire equipment needed to produce nuclear
weapons.
   Reports by German media and foreign groups about the involvement
of German companies aroused anger in foreign capitals, including
Washington, and among Jewish groups at home and abroad. Opposition
politicians in Germany demand stronger export controls, even a ban
on arms deliveries outside NATO countries.
   Prosecutors are investigating dozens of companies and some
arrests have been made. Two company officials have confessed to
helping Iraq obtain the technology to make chemical weapons.
   The government, already tainted by the scandal two years ago of
German involvement in a Libyan poison gas factory, says it is
considering steps to curb illegal arms exports.
   That will not be easy in a country whose economy is based on
exports.
   ``There is no doubt that German companies participated in the
Iraqi rocket program,'' said Norbert Gansel, a member of Parliament
from the oppositon Social Democrats and an expert on arms exports.
   ``I am not saying that the government wanted it to be that
way,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Gansel said the government had taken intelligence reports on
involvement in illegal weapons sales to Iraq ``all too lightly.''
   German law forbids arms exports to areas of tension. Gansel said
German companies convicted of illegal dealings with Iraq should
have their arms producing licenses revoked.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann has proposed milder steps.
He wants each company to name a manager of weapons exports who
could be held responsible if export laws were broken.
   Other countries also delivered war material to Iraq, but the
level of technology provided by German companies allowed Saddam to
pursue poison gas and missile programs, according to reports in Der
Spiegel, a weekly news magazine.
   A report commissioned by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles lists 86 German companies that helped Iraq become a
military power.
   Raymond Seitz, assistant U.S. secretary of state, told Congress
this month there were ``German footprints'' all over equipment
shipped to Iraq in recent years, but acknowledged it ``is not
exclusively a German problem.''
   In a fact sheet published six days after Iraq seized Kuwait on
Aug. 2, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said
Germany was far behind some other nations in providing military
hardware to Iraq in the last decade.
   It said the Soviet Union, France and China, three permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, were the main suppliers in
that period.
   The moral question is especially troubling for Germany.
   Saddam has threatened to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
Poison gas was developed and used by the Germans during World War
I, and was used to kill Jews in Nazi gas chambers.
   Spiegel said a German company helped Iraq develop a
high-performance fuel that increased the range of its rockets.
   Ian Anthony, a co-author of the Stockholm institute's report,
sad it was hard to stop illegal exports from Wetern Europe.
   ``There are virtually no border controls in the European
Economic Community,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It is
very, very difficult for governments with rather limited resources
to enforce the regulations that exist.''
   A high official of Germany's federal customs office said 98
percent of arms exports are shipped in parts, making them difficult
to track.
   Many goods also fall in the ``dual-use'' category, allowing
companies to claim they did not know their equipment was destined
for military use, the official said, on condition of anonymity.
   He said Iraq often ordered equipment from small firms that had
financial problems, but some of Germany's best-known companies also
have been implicated.
   According to Spiegel, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm helped Iraq
obtain the ``fuel air explosive'' bomb, which sprays fuel into the
air and ignites the mixture of fuel and air, creating a huge
fireball and a shock wave comparable in strength to a small nuclear
explosion.
   The company, a major defense contractor, denied the allegations.
It said a study was conducted for the Egyptian government but the
project was discontinued in 1988. Spiegel said Iraq obtained the
study through Egypt.
   Much of Spiegel's reporting has been based on a confidential
report delivered to Parliament in August by Haussmann, the
economics minister.
   According to the magazine, Haussmann's report said medium-sized
German companies were deeply involved in supplying Iraq with parts
and the know-how to upgrade Soviet-made Scud-B rockets.
   Another company named by Spiegel was Water Engineering Trading
GmbH of Hamburg, which it said supplied Iraq with chemicals to
produce nerve gas.
   Two managers at the company have admitted to prosecutors that
they helped Iraq obtain equipment to make poison gas. Both also had
spent several years with German intelligence.

   Federal regulations that bar the staffs of
government-subsidized family planning clinics from discussing
abortion with their clients are coming under Supreme Court
scrutiny.
   Although fueled by the continuing struggle over abortion, the
legal dispute being argued before the court today more directly
involves free speech rights rather than women's right to end their
pregnancies.
   At stake is the information available to the 5 million
low-income women who depend on family planning clinics and similar
health care providers.
   Several anti-abortion organizations are urging the justices to
use the family clinic case to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion.
   Justice Department lawyers, defending the regulations at issue,
said the Bush administration still favors reversal of the 1973
decision. But they did not say this was the appropriate case for
such court action.
   Federal regulations imposed by the Reagan administration in 1988
called for the ban on counseling about abortion, but court
challenges have kept the rules from being enforced virtually
everywhere.
   A federal appeals court upheld the 1988 regulations, but other
federal courts have ruled them an unconstitutional infringement on
free speech rights.
   The justices are expected to resolve the conflicting rulings by
next July.
   Last year, about 4,000 family planning clinics nationwide
received about $140 million in federal assistance.
   The family planning clinic program, enacted by Congress as Title
X of the Public Health Service Act, pays for creating and operating
the clinics. For most clinics, federal money accounts for only a
portion - perhaps 10 percent - of their budgets.
   Challengers of the regulations say they represent a kind of
``viewpoint discrimination.''
   ``Women who have come to rely on Title X for medically sound
advice will be misled,'' they told the court in written briefs.
``The silence of a trusted doctor on the subject of abortion will
lead many women to believe that abortion is not an appropriate or
medically indicated option for them.''
   But Bush administration lawyers argue that the government may
choose to favor childbirth over abortion when deciding how to spend
taxpayer money.
   The clinics always have been banned from using federal money to
perform abortions, but regulations originally let the clinic staffs
- doctors and counselors - tell women about the abortion option and
make referrals.
   After those regulations drew criticism from anti-abortion
groups, the Reagan administration said the clinics may not
``encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family
planning'' or distribute written materials about abortion.
   Under the 1988 regulations, a woman who visited a federally
funded family planning clinic and asked about abortion would have
to be told that the clinic staff ``does not consider abortion an
appropriate method of family planning.''
   Staff members then could offer help in obtaining prenatal care.
   The high court has not been the sole battlefield. Legislation to
sweep away the counseling ban was introduced in Congress last week
and is expected to be reintroduced when the new Congres convenes
in January.
   ``I don't think this is so much a pro-choice or pro-life
question,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., a sponsor of the House
bill to lift the ban. ``It's a question of counseling, of providing
full information.''

<TEXT>
   A 1,200-pound polar bear called Major
will lose his home next month. So will elderly orangutans Stanley
and Betty, and a skinny Siberian tiger named Sasha. The 85-year-old
Stone Zoo is closing because of state budget cuts.
   ``You can't help (but) develop attachments to the animals,''
said Mark Goldstein, the zoo's director. ``You think of them as
individuals.''
   The zoo in this Boston suburb was already running on a
shoestring, when its budget was slashed by 30 percent from last
year because of the state's financial problems. Zoo officials
decided to close Nov. 12 rather than house the animals in shoddy
conditions.
   ``There are things worse than no zoo, like a bad zoo,''
Goldstein said.
   About half the zoo's 200 or so residents will find homes at the
Franklin Park Zoo, the larger of the two facilities run by
MetroParks Zoos. Some will be moved to other zoos around the
country.
   But some are just too old or too big to relocate easily.
   ``For some, it will take months to find them a good home,''
Goldstein said. ``But we won't let them end up in private
collections. And we hope none will have to be euthanized.''
   Large meat-eaters are expensive to feed and maintain, said John
Linehan, curator of mammals for the MetroParks Zoos.
   That doesn't help Major, who eats about 14 pounds of meat and
biscuits a day - when he's on a diet.
   Sasha has an enzyme problem that leaves her a little on the
skinny side. And though lions and tigers are increasingly scarce in
the wild, they are actually fairly abundant in U.S. zoos.
   Orangutans Stanley, 31, and Betty, 30, look like a pair of
sad-eyed, rust-haired Buddhas sitting quietly in their separate
glass enclosures.
   But they are more mischievous than tranquil.
   ``Betty steals tools and you have to trade them back,'' Linehan
said. ``She gets a brush and starts scrubbing the walls like we do.
She won't go through doors she wants you to go through. She demands
a lot of attention.''
   The two primates have been together 20 years and produced four
offspring. But they'll probably be separated when the zoo closes.
   Stanley may return to Brookfield Zoo near Chicago, his first
home, but Betty's future is less clear, since she is old, fat and
has an abdominal cyst that has left her unable to reproduce.
   But don't think the separation will leave either orang
heartbroken, keepers said.
   ``Betty steals Stanley's toys,'' Linehan said. ``Stanley is
nice, except when he wants to have his way with Betty. They won't
miss each other.''
   Wherever he ends up, Stanley will be ``happy to have females
around,'' said Linehan. ``He's pretty feisty for his age.''
   Goldstein hopes that Stone Zoo can reopen someday. A bill in the
Legislature would take the zoo out of state control and make it a
public, non-profit corporation, similar to a structure used by most
other successful zoos nationwide.
   But for now the outlook isn't bright, for the zoo's animals or
its patrons.
   Thelma Dennis, 69, has been a volunteer zoo tour guide for
children for the past 11 years.
   ``Of course I'm awfully sad,'' Dennis said. ``This is the real
thing, or next to the real thing. Kids can't get the same feeling
for an animal on TV that they can seeing them here.''
   ``We're trying to get kids off the streets and we're taking away
the zoos, the museums,'' said Goldstein.
   ``You can be 75 years old and want to take a 3-year-old out for
the day,'' he added. ``I challenge you to find something else you'd
both enjoy.''

<HEAD>New Forecast Of Persistent Rise In Global Air Traffic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International air traffic is expected to increase
by about 8 percent this year and more than 6 percent in each of the
next four years, with the Far East experiencing the most growth,
the leading industry group says.
   Guenter Eser, the German director general of the International
Air Transport Association (IATA), said Sunday that the forecasts
were set before the effects of the Persian Gulf crisis on passenger
traffic became clear.
   Regardless, he said the industry's major problem ``continues to
be the lack of airport and airspace capacity and this is likely to
be the case for a number of years to come.''
   The problem remains most severe in Europe, but is rapidly
increasing in the Far East, Eser said in his report to
association's annual assembly.
   The gulf crisis, which has raised fuel and insurance costs,
tightened a profit squeeze on the industry, he said.
   Overall profits by member airlines on international scheduled
flights dropped sharply last year to 0.4 percent on revenues of
$144.5 billion, the lowest margin since 1986.
   ``It is impossible to forecast the outcome for the full year
(1990), but the industry aggregate result is probably not going to
be very good,'' said Eser.
   IATA member airlines carried nearly 212 million international
passengers last year, a 7 percent rise.
   Traffic is expected to grow 8 percent this year, 6.9 percent in
1991 and remain at about 6.5 percent annually through 1994, latest
IATA figures showed.

   The temperature in the coal mine 3,900
feet down had hit 100 degrees when Volodya Kyechin's vision started
to blur. Then the rock floor became rubbery, and the dimly lit
shaft went black.
   Kyechi awoke hours later on the surface, with a case of heat
stroke. Over the next nine years, the stout Ukrainian developed
high blood pressure, lost half his pay and began dreaming of
leaving the mines for good.
   The average life expectancy of a Soviet coal miner is 48 years.
They can retire at 55, but only 5 percent reach that age.
   ``The work conditions are hard, and I've come to the conclusion
that I should leave the mine,'' said the 40-year-old Kyechin,
sitting with his wife, Tanya, at a table in his apartment on the
outskirts of this industrial city.
   Soviet miners are relatively well paid, earning an average of
375 rubles a month, 50 percent more than the national average. But
no matter what the pay, Kyechin said, ``What's the point ... to go
underground where, each time, nobody knows what will happen?''
   Miners from across the Soviet Union echoed that sentiment at a
five-day congress in Donetsk last week. Accusing the state-run
union of failing to represent their interests, they voted to form
the country's first independent nationwide labor union.
   Among their principal demands are safety improvements and a say
in the operation of their mines.
   Kyechin, a miner for nearly 20 years, said he would wait to see
what the new union promises before joining. ``I need to know what
they would do for me,'' he said.
   A television flickered in the comfortable two-bedroom apartment
as the couple poured out their lives over a feast that included
caviar and vodka, both difficult to find in stores.
   As a department store manager, Tanya is plugged into a network
of contacts who help each other obtain the latest goods whenever
and wherever they show up.
   ``If we come across a can of fish, we buy not one, but 10,'' and
distribute them among friends, she said.
   The walls and floors of most rooms were covered with valuable
Bukharan rugs - ``it's better to put your money into such things,''
Kyechin said - and a china cabinet stretched across the living room
wall, jammed with a half-dozen sets of fine, hard-to-find dishes.
   The Kyechins and their two daughters, ages 14 and 6, live in a
block of pre-fabricated apartment buildings on the outskirts of
Donetsk, a sprawling city of 1.2 million. There are some 40 mines
within the city limits, and about 80 others scattered across the
hilly coal basin.
   With lax enforcement of safety rules and unreliable medical
care, mining is one of the country's most hazardous jobs. An
average of 800 Soviet miners die on the job every year; 55 died in
the United States in 1988.
   Among other problems, the extreme depth of many Soviet mines
makes it difficult to ventilate them and lower the heat generated
by churning machinery and the earth itself.
   Most countries prohibit mining when the heat reaches a certain
level. Soviet miners say their bosses ignore such rules in a
heedless drive to win bonuses for fulfilling plans or avoid
punishment for failing.
   ``The deputy director of the mine told the doctor not to write
down heat stroke,'' Kyechin said bitterly, recounting his collapse
in 1981. ``He said, `Let it be an ordinary case of accidental
trauma.'''
   If heat stroke had been reported, Kyechin explained, a committee
would have questioned the mine's supervisers about it. ``And of
course, they would catch hell from their superiors and would make
less money.''
   Kyechin said he protested at first, then capitulated, deciding
his relations with the mine director were too important to be
risked.
   ``If you are against them, you are nothing,'' he said.
   After the heat stroke episode, Kyechin began to suffer high
blood pressure. Over the next nine years, he was transferred from
mine to mine around the Donetsk basin.
   On Aug. 6, while working in a ventilation shaft, he suffered
heat stroke again, Kyechin said. He was hospitalized for nearly a
month with high blood pressure, then released with an
``occupational disease'' and given a job as a tunneler, which pays
260 rubles a month (about $480).
   Even with additional compensation for his illness, Kyechin's
salary is now little more than half the 700 rubles that he once
earned as a chief engineer, and that allowed him to fill his
apartment with valuables.
   Because of his long absence from work, he also lost a chance to
buy a car through the official union.
   Fed up with his treatment by superiors, all members of the
Communist Party, Kyechin ended his 20-year party membership.
   ``The party does nothing. There's nothing in it for our
future,'' he said.
   Now, Kyechin has his eye on a new career. An engineer by
training, he has a dream of forming a cooperative to repair and
remodel apartments. ``I was even thinking of buying a shop,'' he
said.

   Republican Jon Grunseth dropped out of the
Minnesota governor's race Sunday amid allegations that he had an
affair while he was married to his first and second wives and that
he tried to get teen-age girls to swim nude with him in 1981.
   ``There are three things that are extremely important to me - my
wife, my family, first and foremost; the Republican Party, the
people of Minnesota,'' Grunseth said from his home 20 miles east of
Minneapolis.
   ``And the events of the last three weeks have put enormous
pressure on the family and I think on the political process and on
the people of Minnesota,'' he said. ``I therefore decided to
withdraw as the Republican candidate for governor.''
   It was not immediately clear whether there would be a
replacement Republican candidate on the ballot in the Nov. 6
election.
   Grunseth's campaign was thrown into turmoil Oct. 15 when it was
reported that two women said in sworn statements that he tried to
get them to swim nude with him during a 1981 pool party at his
home.
   The women, who were then 13 and 14, said they refused but that
Grunseth, his teen-age daughter and a 16-year-old girl took off
their bathing suits. One of the women also said Grunseth tried to
pull down her bathing suit top and touch her breast. Grunseth
denied the allegations.
   Grunseth nearly withdrew from the race Thursday but changed his
mind several hours later.
   On Saturday, Grunseth acknowledged to the Star Tribune newspaper
he had a ``romantic'' relationship with 32-year-old Tamara Taylor
of Minnetonka, but said it ended ``a long time ago - in the early
'80s.''
   Grunseth, 44, divorced Katharine Winston in 1983 and married his
second wife, Vicki, in 1984.
   Taylor claimed she had an intermittent sexual relationship with
Grunseth from 1980 to 1989 while he was married to his first and
second wives.
   Grunseth said his affair with the woman ended before he
remarried in 1984. He has denied the nude-swimming allegations.
   Later Sunday, Grunseth told reporters he had over the last two
weeks been on the verge of quitting the governor's race.
   ``It's wear and tear, it's just simply pure wear and tear,''
Grunseth said. ``The whole thing becomes sickening. It's
exhaustion, is what it is. Mental, physical, emotional exhaustion.
...At a point there's an end. You just say, `Man, it's more than I
can bear.'''
   His wife said she believes her husband's contention that he
ended the affair before they married. She said she did not try to
dissuade him from dropping out of the race.
   Taylor said in a statement Sunday she disclosed her affair with
Grunseth to prevent his ``further deceptionof the voters ... in
regard to his past antics, his character, and what ruthless actions
he is willing to take in order to be elected governor.''
   Leon Oistad, Grunseth's campaign manager, had vowed Saturday
that Grunseth would remain in the race.
   Oistad blamed the latest controversy in the Republican's bid to
unseat Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich on a witch hunt led by the Star
Tribune, which published Taylor's story Sunday.
   Grunseth said his withdrawal from the race will be effective as
soon as the necessary paperwork was processed.
   Perpich is seeking a fourth term and state Auditor Arne Carlson,
the runner-up in the Sept. 11 GOP primary, re-entered the race as a
write-in candidate last week.
   The state GOP executive committee can name a replacement for
Grunseth on the ballot. However, party co-chairwoman Barb Sykora
said it was uncertain whether the committee can be convened in time
before Friday's deadline for candidates to be formally named if
they are to appear on the ballot.
   ``It looks like we should support Arne Carlson,'' Sykora said.
``Arne's very well qualified to be governor. Can the party survive?
We have to survive. We have terrific candidates running at all
levels.''
   Grunseth said Republicans should unite behind his successor.
   ``They've got a superb opportunity to defeat Rudy Perpich even
though it's a very short period of time,'' he said.
   ``As I've said before, the road to the defeat Rudy Perpich has
been paved with my reputation and the tears of the Grunseth family,
and I think it's wide open for the Republicans to take,'' Grunseth
said.
   Carlson said he was surprised that Grunseth was pulling out.
   ``I'm sad for Jon and his family. One doesn't revel in another
person's difficulty,'' Carlson said.
   ``I'm going to spend a lot of time now to make sure we heal the
wounds,'' he said. ``I have to reach to all areas of the Republican
Party to bring this together so we can put together a winning
election.''

who could prevent Grunseth's ``further deception of the voters.''
   ``Most troubling to me, knowing what Jon had told me about his
personal life in the past, was the fact that he was willing to go
to such great lengths to publicly try to exonerate himself in order
to forge ahead with his campaign with total disregard to the
knowledge that he was seriously affecting the reputations and
future of these two women by calling them liars,'' Taylor said in a
statement Sunday.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The golf-crazy Japanese are flocking to
Thailand to enjoy low greens fees, friendly caddies and courses
laid out by some of the world's top designers.
   Thailand is in a golf boom. Mana Sookbank, honorary secretary of
the Thailand Golf Association, said there are 60 courses in
operation, 40 under construction and many more planned.
   For the Japanese, golfing in Thailand costs a fraction of what
it does at home. They are joined by burgeoning ranks of domestic
players, from corporate climbers to Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan, who conducts a lot of political business on the links.
   Players soon will be able to tee off near the River Kwai, where
Allied prisoners died by the thousands building a railway for the
Japanese in World War II, and in the hills of the infamous Golden
Triangle opium region.
   A complex of courses, hotels and an airstrip billed as Asia's
largest golf development will stretch along the Gulf of Siam
southwest of Bangkok. It is to include a meditation center.
   ``Thailand's boom comes at a fortunate time,'' said Desmond
Muirhead, a leading golf course designer. ``Instead of building
second-rate courses by themselves, like the Japanese did after
World War II, the Thais are getting top foreign talent.''
   Muirhead, a Briton based in the United States, said he plans to
design at least five courses in Thailand and has begun work on the
Century Country Club in the eastern coastal province of Rayong.
   The $100 million project includes individual homes,
condominiums, a hotel and two golf courses, one by Muirhead and the
other by top-ranked professional Nick Faldo. Among the other big
names at work in Thailand are Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Greg
Norman.
   ``People are going to beat a path from all over to play these
courses,'' Muirhead said in an interview. ``We expect them to be
more visually pleasing than those in the United States.''
   While genuine interest in the sport is behind the boom, many who
wouldn't know a birdie from a bogey are getting in on the action.
Acquiring golf club memberships for speculation, as if they were
commodities futures, has become a lucrative business.
   Mana, of the golf association, said a membership at Green Valley
Golf Course had gone up nearly 700 percent in three years to
800,000 baht, or $32,000.
   Even so, club memberships remain cheaper than in Japan, Taiwan,
Singapore, and Hong Kong. Golfers and investors from those
countries are lining up for the leading Thai clubs, some of which
have had to place quotas on foreigners.
   Golf was introduced by Thai royalty in the 1920s. It has
attracted the elite ever since, and spread to other classes because
of economic prosperity, tourism and the sport's growing worldwide
popularity.
   The Japanese, including members of the large expatriate
community, frequently describe playing here as ``being in golfer's
heaven.'' Greens fees at luxurious, uncrowded clubs are about $40
and low labor costs permit levels of course maintenance and service
that are rare in other countries.
   Many golfing parties have a trail of caddies, often young women
who carry portable stools, umbrellas, cold drinks and towels as
well as clubs.
   At home, Japanese golfers must reserve playing time far in
advance, then battle weekend traffic to reach congested courses. At
clubs in the Tokyo area, non-members pay at least $240 for 18
holes, meals and transportation.
   South Korea and Taiwan, closer than Thailand, still are favored
foreign destinations for Japan's 15 million golfers, but the Thais
expect their traffic to grow. Travel agencies in Japan offer
five-day, all-inclusive golf tours for about $1,600, the cost of
half a dozen rounds at home.
   Critics of the golf explosion say valuable farm land is being
lost and the environment harmed in some areas. Officials have
questioned whether investing millions in a sport for the wealthy is
appropriate for a developing nation.
   Promoters argue that golf courses provide more, higher-payed
jobs than the same land devoted to agriculture. They say courses
are environmental assets in urban areas, serving as the green belts
that government planning has not provided.

   The latest wave in the sea of refugees
created by the Persian Gulf crisis is cresting here in this small
nation. For some, it is a sad and bitter homecoming to a land that
no longer feels like home.
   In the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Yemenis
were cast out of their promised land - Saudi Arabia, where they had
earned good wages and made new lives for themselves. Some spent
decades there.
   In the past five weeks, up to 750,000 Yemeni nationals have
returned to their mountainous homeland at the tip of the Arabian
peninsula, where North and South Yemen reunited earlier this year
to form the new nation of Yemen.
   They bring with them what they can, in cars and trucks piled
high as parade floats. But they leave much behind.
   Saudi officials have said Yemenis were stripped of their right
to stay because of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's sympathies for
Saddam Hussein and anti-Saudi demonstrations in San`a, the Yemen
capital.
   Yemen denies it sided with Saddam, although it failed to support
U.N. resolutions against him soon after the invasion.
   The total number of those returning, based on Saudi and Yemeni
figures, could not be determined accurately since many families
crossed the border here on a single document, and individuals were
not counted.
   The numbers dwindled after Saudi authorities recently extended
until late November the deadline for 1 million to 2 million Yemenis
to find a local sponsor - or get out. But a new wave is expected.
   ``This was not a reasonable decision,'' said Jamal Mohammed
Saad, 35, standing amid his remaining possessions after 16 years in
Saudi Arabia. ``People had no time to time to sell their houses or
property. It is impossible.''
   Departing Yemenis were allowed to transfer bank deposits and
take out property. But Saudi authorities, trying to curb smuggling,
have been confiscating some goods.
   ``They have my tires, 70 tires,'' wailed Mohammed Sultan, who
said he abandoned his automotive shop for lack of a buyer and piled
his stock onto a truck. Saudi officials said he had no vouchers for
the tires.
   Another man, jostling for attention among a crowd of people
waiting at a border post in the baking sun, said plaintively:
``They took my box of apples.''
   Col. Ahmed Mohammed Shamrani, head of the Saudi border post near
here, said about 350,000 Yemeni passports had been stamped since
Sept. 18.
   Another 100,000 people were cleared without documents. And tens
of thousands returned via other crossings, he said. Since many
passports listed several family members, the overall total was
believed in the range of 750,000.
   Few returnees reported any serious maltreatment, and most seemed
to take the disruption to their lives with a certain fatalism.
   But the distress was plain to see. Ramshackle settlements of
burlap and plywood sprouted on the highway, housing people who had
lost touch with families during their time in Saudi Arabia. Some
had been away for as long as 40 years.
   In Saudi Arabia, the impact of the Yemeni exodus has been severe
in sectors of retail trade and some services. Along roads in Jiddah
and Riyadh, rows of shops are bolted shut.
   Many companies arranged to sponsor their Yemeni employees, but a
number of returnees said that Saudis were afraid to back them for
fear of official reprisals. Saudi authorities deny this.
   At the Yemenis' old bedouin silver souk in Saudi Arabia at
Khamis Mushet, Khalid Haji was the last to go. He sold off
heirlooms at giveaway prices.
   ``We've made our life here, not there, and I have nothing to do
with politics, but what choice is there?'' he said.
   Asked when he came to settle in Saudi Arabia, he smiled ruefully
and tapped out the digits on his calculator: 1957.
   In Jiddah, a luggage merchant who asked to be called only Hamid
was packing up in bags from his own shop.
   ``Saudis and Yemenis have always been like this,'' he said,
interlocking his fingers. ``Why are we suddenly thrown out like
enemies?''
   Yemeni authorities said the influx would burden Yemen's fragile
economy, but insisted the long-term effect would be healthy.
   However, remittances from Yemenis living in Saudi Arabia had
made up one-third of the gross national product, well over $1
billion, counting unofficial transfers. Already, college graduates
here can wait six months for a job.
   At the port city of Hodeidah, the Sagear family stopped to rejig
the mountains of luggage atop two sedans: bedding, tires,
tricycles, suitcases, a television. They have been away 20 years.
Ali Sagear, 15, has never seen Yemen.
   Ayshe Sagear, 23, said Saudi Arabia is their home, but ``if they
don't want us, we'll find something here.''
   Yahya Ali al-Jouri, sent home from Mecca after 35 years, was
bitter. He sold his grocery business at a fourth of its value and
counted himself lucky to get that much. Now he passes time in the a
San`a tea room in an ancient mud building.
   ``When the Saudis need us, we are welcome,'' he said. ``When
they don't, we are nothing to them.''

   Lance Cpl. Juan Baca, hunkered
down in the belly of a U.S. Marine assault vehicle lurching across
the night desert, asked about the demonstrations back home against
Operation Desert Shield.
   ``It ticks me off,'' said Baca, 20, of Lubbock, Texas. ``This
isn't Vietnam. This is a totally different situation.''
   Vietnam was long ago and far away, but the conflict is much on
the minds of young soldiers in Saudi Arabia.
   Word of antiwar demonstrations back home has trickled back to
the troops here, who are the tip of the military spear pointed at
Saddam Hussein's forces.
   They are mindful of the hostile reception that greeted Vietnam
veterans a generation ago when they came home from an unpopular
war.
   They fear a loss of public support for the deployment of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf region could bring similar anger down on
their heads.
   ``I'd feel betrayed if people turned against us,'' said Cpl.
John Vaughn, 23, of Bravo Company of the 3rd Marine Regiment, based
in Hawaii. Vaughn, from Detroit, is nicknamed ``Lifer'' - the
military slang for a career military man.
   Vietnam was America's longest war, the only war America lost, a
war marked by campus riots and draft card burnings, bitterness and
shame. The scars are still apparent.
   ``I would hope people would put it aside and learn from it, but
not judge every conflict by what happened in Vietnam,'' said Baca.
``We'd like it a whole lot better if people were patting us on the
back.''
   Several soldiers approached reporters to ask about support on
the home front for the troops in the gulf.
   Public backing for the deployment was initially high, but there
has been increasing criticism of President Bush's actions as the
high cost of the operation sinks in, and people face up to the
prospect of a shooting war in the region.
   Some of the soldiers in Saudi Arabia have firsthand memories of
Vietnam - and painful ones.
   Maj. John Bates, 44, of Little Rock, Ark., an executive officer
for a Marine battalion, was wounded in the conflict. He was shot in
the lung.
   From his standpoint, the American people misdirected their anger
at the fighting men in Southeast Asia, instead of targeting the
politicians who sent them there.
   ``The military doesn't make policy. We only enforce it,'' said
Bates, in a mess tent set up in the sand. ``People were pointing
the finger in the wrong direction.''
   Vietnam memories are still strong for 1st Sgt. Chuck Woodruff,
38, of Oroville, Calif. He was on the second-to-last helicopter
that left the roof of the U.S. Embassy when Saigon fell on April
30, 1975.
   ``The question keeps coming up because there's nothing to
compare this to except Vietnam. This is the biggest military
operation since then,'' said Woodruff, who has the Marine Corps
emblem tatooed on his left arm. ``I think it will take generations
and decades before people forget.''
   Support from home means a lot to troops huffing, puffing and
sweating it out under a relentless Saudi sun, 7,000 miles from the
East Coast.
   Staff Sgt. Charles Woods, 31, of North Glenn, Colo., said the
troops could deal with the conditions, ``as long as they know the
American people are behind them.''
   Woods, fresh from a tactical exercise in which Marines practiced
assaulting a fortified bunker, was quick to point out how much the
troops appreciate letters from schoolchildren, churches and
individuals who write encouraging notes addressed just to any
soldier.
   Vietnam veterans make their presence felt in other branches of
the military as well. At the U.S. Navy's Fleet Hospital No. 5, a
sign on one desk read ``Vietnam Veteran and Proud Of It.''
   Another Vietnam veteran is Col. Jim Gass, 48, of Carney, Okla.,
an artillery unit commander in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division.
   ``No soldier wants to go somewhere away from home and have the
country not support him,'' Gass said. ``Today's soldiers want to
know their causes are just.''

<TEXT>
   Egypt's military involvement in the Persian
Gulf crisis is proving to be a financial windfall for President
Hosni Mubarak's government.
   Its U.S. and Arab allies are moving to write off $14 billion in
debts - almost a third of a $50 billion obligation to foreign
creditors that for years has crippled the Egyptian economy.
   Aid worth hundreds of millions of dollars also is pouring in,
and prospects are considered bright for agreement with the
International Monetary Fund to reschedule the remaining foreign
debt.
   Mubarak is reaping political benefits as well. Egyptian
commentators are praising his handling of the gulf crisis that
began Aug. 2 with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Mahfouz el-Ansary, editor of the government's Al-Gomhuriya
newspaper, hailed Mubarak's ``determination and skill,'' his
``patience, wisdom and hard work.''
   At the onset of the crisis, it hardly looked as if Mubarak would
emerge a winner. He was humiliated by the failure of a last-minute
bid to stave off the Iraqi invasion - an effort that Saddam Hussein
let him believe had succeeded right until the Iraqi president sent
tanks into Kuwait.
   Back then, Egypt had looked likely to be a big financial loser
in the conflict. It faced losses estimated at $4.5 billion in the
form of a ruined tourism industry, reduced Suez Canal revenues and
dwindling remittances from Egyptians working in gulf countries.
   What turned the tide was Mubarak's strong, quick response to the
Iraqi takeover.
   He muscled through an Arab League summit a resolution condemning
Iraq, demanding withdrawal from the emirate, and authorizing
dispatch of troops to the gulf region.
   Then, he sent nearly 16,000 Egyptian troops to Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates. They were there to help defend those Arab
states, but more importantly, the Arab involvement made the
presence of the multinational force in Saudi Arabia far more
politically palatable. The United States has an estimated 220,000
troops in the gulf.
   Mubarak has made repeated efforts to find a diplomatic solution
to the crisis, but he said Sunday he was ready to send more troops
as well as military planes to Saudi Arabia if they were requested.
   ``With peace efforts, that does not mean we can relax military
action,'' the Egyptian president said at a news conference.
   Mubarak spent four days in the gulf region last week, visiting
four states allied with him against Iraq. At the end of the tour,
it was announced that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates
and Kuwait's exiled government were writing off more than $7
billion that Egypt owes them.
   In the United States, forgiveness of a $6. billion Egyptian
debt was part of the foreign aid program that Congress approved and
sent to President Bush before adjourning early Sunday.
   Bush, in Honolulu, said Sunday he would sign the measure.
   Prime Minister Atef Sedki said Saturday that interest on the
military debt alone amounts to almost $1 billion annually.
   As for other debt relief, Egypt has been trying to negotiate a
new package with the International Monetary Fund since a 1988
rescheduling agreement expired.
   Western economists in Cairo say Egypt and the IMF have ironed
out most of their differences and expect to sign a new pact early
next year. That will pave the way for Cairo's main creditors, the
Paris Club, to convene and arrange rescheduling.
   A well-informed economist, speaking on condition he not be
further identified, said Egypt has agreed to reduce subsidies
further on basic food items, a key IMF reform demand. Additionally,
he said, Cairo will further devalue the Egyptian pound and raise
bank interest rates.
   But he said signing will be delayed because some of the
commitments must be ratified by the People's Assembly, Egypt's
parliament, which is presently dissolved. A new parliament will be
elected in late November and seated in December.

   Katharine Hepburn says that getting old is ``a
bore'' and that death will be a relief from reporters.
   Asked if she fears death, the 83-year-old actress told People
magazine in its Nov. 5 issue: ``Not at all. Be a great relief. Then
I wouldn't have to talk to you.''
   So why did she agree to an interview?
   ``Soon it will be too late, and I'd rather do this myself than
have others do it after I'm dead. They never get things straight,''
she said.
   Getting old, she said, is a ``B-O-R-E, when you find you've
begun to rot.''
   A book of photographs shot over the last 15 years by John
Bryson, ``The Private World of Katharine Hepburn,'' will be
published in November.
   Hepburn also is hard at work on an autobiography, which she
calls ``a bunch of stories.'' It is due out in August.

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) - ``Crocodile Dundee'' star Paul
Hogan and his bride, Linda Kozlowksi, have bought a $6.5 million
English-style home with a stone waterfall.
   Hogan and Kozlowski, co-stars in the two ``Dundee'' films,
married in May after starring in ``Almost an Angel.'' The comedy
comes out in December.
   The two-story Beverly Hills house has three bedrooms, four baths
and two maids' quarters. It also has a tennis court, pool and spa.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - Peter Horton, who plays Gary on ABC's
``thirtysomething,'' predicts the show will last no longer than
another season.
   ``There's just so much this bucket of `thirtysomething' can give
out,'' said Horton in the Nov. 3 issue of TV Guide.
   ``We've been mining it for more than three years, and we're
starting to scrape bottom. I don't know how much more there is to
say about this group of people.''
   But Horton, who plays a college professor who has trouble coming
to grips with responsibility, said breaking up will be hard to do.
   ``We have a huge, almost visceral attachment to the show and to
each other,'' he said. ``We'll all still be friends, but we'll
drift apart. It's sad to think about.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Kirstie Alley says she's willing to pay
the supermarket tabloids for the names of people who leak
information to the reporters of Tinseltown.
   ``Those sleazeballs who write this crap are so slimy they'll
gladly inform on their informants for money,'' the star of
``Cheers'' and the new movie ``Sibling Rivalry'' said in Sunday's
The Tennessean.
   ``I'm about to get a list of the people at Paramount who are
feeding them stuff. I'll make sure they won't work there again.''
   ``No way will I dignify those people by suing them,'' she said.
``I try to ignore everything, hoping people will realize what total
lies they are telling.''
   ---
   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - Rap star Kurtis Blow says he's playing it
cool working as a consultant on a rap music story line for ABC's
``All My Children.''
   ``There has been a lot of pressure from the network brass to
keep our songs clean and commercial,'' Blow said in the Nov. 3
issue of TV Guide. ``Rap's been getting a bad rap lately, so we are
being very careful not to offend.
   ``When I started out, rap was positive and fun,'' said Blow,
whose ``Christmas Rappin' '' went gold in 1979. ``Somehow, the
press zoomed in on the hard-core, negative stuff and it all got out
of balance.''
   Blow is writing tunes, coaching actors and approving costuming
and the lighting for club sequences on the soap opera.

   The clout of this country's Maronite
Catholics, who have dominated its politics for a half century, is
rapidly crumbling amid blood feuds and a new Moslem ascendancy.
   The end of an era is looming for the only Christians in the
overwhelmingly Moslem Middle East to have controlled a state since
the Crusaders in the Middle Ages.
   The Gemayels, Chamouns and Franjiehs - the clans that have ruled
fractious Lebanon since independence from France in 1943 - are
entangled in a new round of vendettas that will probably seal their
fate.
   The Oct. 21 slaying of Maronite political leader Dany Chamoun
and most of his family was the latest.
   ``No one listens to the voice of reason,'' Papal Nuncio Pablo
Puente lamented recently. ``Christians are destroying Christians in
senseless bloodbaths.''
   The nearly 1 million Maronites, the main Christian sect in
Lebanon, have suffered more from their own feuds than from conflict
with Moslems in the nation's 15-year-old civil war.
   Under a proposed Arab League-brokered peace plan, the Maronites
would have to share power with Moslems, who now comprise a majority
of the 3.5 million people in a nation where Islamic fundamentalism
is on the rise.
   But many Maronites are reluctant to give up their privileges.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to go back to even worse times if the
Maronite establishment fails to respond to the winds of change,''
warned Elie Hobeika, a Syrian-backed leftist Maronite at odds with
the dominant right-wingers of his sect.
   Hobeika foresaw the need for the Maronites to give ground or
eventually perish and signed a Syrian-brokered peace treaty with
the main Moslem warlords in 1985, when he headed the Christians'
main militia, the Lebanese Forces.
   But he was ousted by right-wing diehards the next year and fled
to territory controlled by the Syrians, who have about 40,000
troops in Lebanon.
   Hobeika returned to the Christian heartland northeast of Beirut
after Syrian and government troops crushed rebel Maronite Gen.
Michel Aoun on Oct. 13, removing the main obstacle to the new peace
plan.
   The return of Hobeika, 34, has raised fears of a showdown
between him and Samir Geagea, the right-wing Maronite who ousted
him in 1986 in a shootout that claimed the lives of 350 Christians.
   But even without the feuding, the power of the Maronite
political dynasties has ebbed.
   Christianity has been on the retreat in the Middle East for
years. Christian leaders noted at a recent conference in Cyprus
that Christian emigration from the region, including Lebanon, is
growing amid rising Islamic fundamentalism.
   There are an estimated 12 million Christians in the Middle East
compared with about 120 million Moslems.
   The Maronites - named for St. Maroun, a 5th century Syrian-born
monk who settled in the pine-covered Lebanese mountains - have seen
themselves as part a centuries-old fight for survival against
Islam.
   Yet their reluctance to share power with Moslems helped ignite
the civil war, which has left more than than 150,000 people dead.
   ``They're the only Christian community with a distinct political
history,'' said Prof. Kamal Salibi, who teaches history at the
American University of Beirut. ``They fear being overwhelmed. If
the system is democratized, they'll be outvoted and they can't
carry the day.''
   Of Lebanon's three great Maronite patriarchs, only 79-year-old
Suleiman Franjieh is alive. His rivals, Pierre Gemayel and Camille
Chamoun, survived several assassination attempts and died of
natural causes.
   Now their heirs are at each others' throats.
   Patriarch Nasralla Sfeir, the Maronite's spiritual head, has
proved helpless in efforts to try to reconcile them.
   His appeals for cease-fires and threats of excommunication have
gone unheeded, a far cry from the days when Maronite politicians
took their instructions from the patriarch.
   Two days after Aoun was crushed, gunmen killed Dany Chamoun, his
wife and two small sons at their home east of Beirut.
   Chamoun was a staunch supporter of Aoun and the slayings
appeared to be aimed at ending the political legacy founded by
Chamoun's father, Camille.
   Other scores have also to be settled among the Maronite clans.
   Phalangist militiamen loyal to Pierre Gemayel's youngest son,
Bashir, attacked Franjieh's domain in north Lebanon on June 13,
1978, and slaughtered his son and political heir, Tony, along with
his wife and daughter and 21 bodyguards.
   Geagea led the assault and the elder Franjieh, a close friend of
Syrian President Hafez Assad, vowed revenge. So far, the massacre
has gone unanswered.
   Bashir Gemayel made no secret two years later that he ordered
his men to slaughter more than 300 members of Chamoun's Tigers
militia north of Beirut.
   Gemayel was elected President Aug. 23, 1982, with Israel's
backing. But he was assassinated in a bombing at Phalange
headquarters in Beirut on Sept. 14, 1982, a week before he was to
be sworn in. The bombing was blamed on a leftist pro-Syrian faction
dominated by Greek Orthodox Christians.
   Gemayel's elder brother, Amin, was elected as his successor.
   But when Amin's violence-ridden term ended in 1988, he fled to
self-imposed exile in Paris, signaling the end of the Gemayel
dynasty.
   Tony Franjieh's son, Suleiman Jr., 23, contends his father was
not avenged by Bashir Gemayel's death. He is reported to be waiting
in the Franjieh's power base of Zghorta to send his 2,000-strong
militia against Geagea.

   A rekindled dispute over specks of inhospitable
rock in the East China Sea is feeding anti-Japanese sentiment in
quarters already fearful that Tokyo is drifting away from pacifism.
   The five tiny islands - the largest only 2.5 miles in diameter -
and three rocks are claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan. The area is
considered a rich fishing ground and is believed to contain oil.
   Japan calls the archipelago the Senkakus, but China and Taiwan
know the islands as the Diaoyutai. After a decade in abeyance, the
argument over them was revived by reports in Taiwan that a
right-wing Japanese group planned to renovate a lighthouse on the
main island.
   Two fishing vessels carried Taiwanese politicians and athletes
to the islands on Oct. 21 in an attempt to reinforce Taiwan's
claim, but were turned back by patrol boats of the Japanese coast
guard.
   In Hong Kong, about 10,000 people turned out for a rally and
march to demand that Japan give up its claim to the islands.
   The confrontation comes at a sensitive time for Tokyo.
   Many Asian nations that were brutally occupied by Japan during
World War II already have expressed concern about a government
proposal now before Japan's parliament to send noncombat troops to
the Persian Gulf.
   That bill would allow the first overseas deployment of Japanese
soldiers since the war. Many believe sending the troops would
violate Japan's postwar constitution, which forbids it to use force
in international disputes.
   Taiwan and China, usually at loggerheads because of their rival
claims to be the legitimate government of all China, have objected
strongly to Japan's sending coast guard vessels to the disputed
islands, which are 120 miles northeast of Taiwan and 95 miles
northwest of Nishiomotejima, a Japanese island.
   Protesters in Taiwan, which was a Japanese colony for 50 years
until World War II ended, have burned the Japanese flag, thrown
eggs outside Japan's representative office in Taipei and vow to
launch another voyage to the islands.
   ``Japan has to recognize the Diaoyutai Islands are our
territory,'' protest leader Lee Ching-hwa said last week. ``They
should stop expanding militarism.''
   Pro-Beijing newspapers in Hong Kong, which reverts from British
to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, have printed emotional editorials
on the islands that recall Japan's expansionist past.
   ``China has been a victim of Japanese militarism,'' the Ta Kung
Pao said. ``There still exists a widespread sentiment among the
Chinese people opposing militarism.''
   A full-page newspaper advertisement by the Hong Kong
Professional Teacher's Union made a clear connection between the
island dispute and fears of renewed Japanese militarism.
   ``Protect Diaoyutai; Teach the next generation,'' it said. The
ad included photographs of Chinese slaughtered by Japanese soldiers
in World War II.
   Japan has repeatedly denied any intention of reviving
militarism.
   It incorporated the islands in 1895. The United States
administered them from the end of World War II until 1972, when
they were returned to Japan.
   China has claimed the chain since ancient times. The Chinese
Nationalist government, now on Taiwan, contends the islets came
under its sovereignty in 1945 when Japan was defeated.
   A 1968 United Nations report said large oil deposits may lie in
nearby seabeds. Japan shelved a joint exploration plan with China
in 1979 because they were too far apart on the sovereignty issue.
   The Foreign Ministry says fishermen recently refurbished the
12-year-old light and want it to be designated an official
navigation beacon, but that the Maritime Safety Agency has made no
decision on the application. The ministry said it knew of no plans
by any right-wing group to make further changes.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has been quoted as saying Japan
would ``act prudently'' on the lighthouse matter. Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe has said there are no plans to have the
navy patrol the islands.
   In Taiwan, Chang Lung-yi of the Institute of International
Relations said he did not see the island incident as a sign of
Japan becoming a military power, but added:
   ``Japan could easily transform its well-developed industries to
making weapons and people are concerned that it would quickly build
up its military power.''
   Some commentators in Tokyo question whether fear of Japanese
militarism is the main factor.
   Yozo Yokota, professor of international law at International
Christian University, believes China may see a chance to reinforce
its claim to the islands while Japan is trying to project a world
image of peacemaker.
   Taiwan, which has been isolated diplomatically because of its
claim to China, may want to demonstrate that it is a regional
power, some Japanese academics believe.
   They say Taiwan also may be trying to portray itself as the
champion of Chinese nationalism.

   For 120 years, the machinery at
Cheshire Mills turned out textiles and helped weave the fabric of a
community.
   On Sunday, about 50 former employees gathered to remember that
community spirit, and how that fabric was torn when the decline of
the textile industry in New England forced Cheshire Mills to close
20 years ago.
   ``It cast a tremendous pall over the town when it happened,''
said Warren Thayer, who was office manager when the mill closed.
``It was like your security blanket was gone.''
   Well-preserved and still housing a descendant business of the
Cheshire Mills, the mill buildings and much of the center of the
small town - population of fewer than 1,000 - were designated a
national historic landmark in 1977.
   Thayer, who took part in the reunion organized by a historic
preservation group, said he joined the company full time in 1956,
50 years after his father went to work at Cheshire Mills. For a
time, his family lived in mill housing.
   ``You lived with this for many years. ... It was a very
paternalistic organization,'' he said. ``We always felt that
there'd always be Cheshire Mills.''
   The Thayers were one of many families who sent multiple
generations to work at the mill or at Harris Mill next door.
   Even Cheshire Mills' president at its closing, John Colony Jr.,
was a descendant of Josiah Colony, who founded the mill about 1850.
Colony said it was hard to shut the mill that was practically the
sole source of employment in Harrisville.
   ``It was a working plant and it was the spine of the town,''
Colony said. ``A lot of people around here working in the mill were
fifth, sixth generation. We felt we had a unique responsibility to
them.''
   But the U.S. textile industry suffered in the face of cheap
foreign labor after World War II, much as the British textile
industry suffered from American competition that peaked during the
Civil War, said Colony's son, John ``Chick'' Colony III.
   ``We did it to the British and the Japanese did it to us,'' he
said.
   The closing came as a shock to the 30 to 50 employees still
working at the mill that once had employed about 300.
   Colony said he called shop overseers into his office one by one
in early October 1970 and sent them out to tell the workers the
company would shut down in two weeks.
   The employees retired, moved away or went to work elsewhere in
the area. A few found work at Harrisville Designs, founded by the
Colonys the year after Cheshire Mills closed. It continues to carry
on mill work in a small way.
   Harrisville Designs, which employs about 25 and is housed in
some of the old Cheshire Mills and Harris Mill buildings, makes
looms and yarn for home weavers.
   The yarn is made on some of the same machines that spun thread
for Cheshire Mills fabrics.
   ``Every year (for nearly 150 years), woolen yarn has been spun
in this town,'' Chick Colony said. ``It's a tradition.''

   Police are questioning and taking
thumbprints from people passing through neighborhoods where five
college students were slain two months ago.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said it may challenge the
practice in court.
   ``We're stopping people in the area if there are any questions
why they're there and (taking thumprints) if they arouse suspicion.
This is not being done in an accusatory way,'' state Highway Patrol
spokesman Maj. Ernie Leggett said.
   Robyn Blumner, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, said
the group wants to talk to people who have been stopped and may
challenge the patrols. They violate constitutional protections
against unlawful searches and seizures, she said.
   Leggett said in Friday's The Gainesville Sun that officers
question and take prints from people on foot, bicycles, mopeds or
motorcycles.
   The newspaper earlier reported that investigators believed the
killer rode a bicycle to at least one of the crime scenes.
   Leggett said he did not know when the patrols began and refused
to say whether they had provided any clues.
   ``It doesn't sound as though they can articulate any objective
criteria for suspicion,'' Blumner said. ``They have to articulate
some reasonable suspicion to even stop someone.''
   Two University of Florida freshmen, both women, were found slain
Aug. 26 in the apartment they shared near campus. A few hours
later, a student at Sante Fe Community College was found
decapitated in her apartment. The next day, two more university
students were found slain.
   Investigators have followed up some 5,000 leads but made no
arrests.
   A $941,639 federal grant paying for the investigation is about
to run out, leaving authorities scrambling for money, said Sgt.
Dick Gerard.
   Although students remain apprehensive, most have returned to
classes.
   University Professor Anne Jones had planned to begin the
semester teaching ``Paris Trout,'' a novel about a string of
murders in a small Georgia town. She postponed the assignment,
figuring the book hit too close to home.
   Last week, ``Paris Trout'' author Pete Dexter spoke to Jones'
students. The book won the 1989 National Book Award.
   Although the campus seems to have returned to normal, fear lurks
below the surface, he said.
   ``That guy represents a force of nature,'' he said. ``It's like
something blowing in off the ocean. It's hard to even hate the guy
doing this - it's so foreign, it's so unreasonable, it's so
unnegotiable.''

   Warsaw Pact armament experts have
agreed on the number of tanks and cannon each member nation may
maintain under an agreement with NATO.
   The state news agency CTK announced Sunday that the pact's
foreign ministers would meet Nov. 3 in Budapest to sign the
agreement.
   The 23 NATO and six Warsaw Pact countries are expected to sign a
conventional arms treaty in Paris during a summit meeting of the
34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe that
opens Nov. 19.
   There had been concerns that the Warsaw Pact nations would not
be ready to sign the comprehensive East-West agreement, and
President Bush has said he will not attend the meeting if the
treaty is not ready.
   While overall quotas for NATO and the Warsaw Pact had been
accepted by both sides, there had been disagreement within the pact
on how its allotment should be divided among member nations.
   Agreement Saturday seemed to rest on a compromise between the
Soviet Union and the five other pact members, formerly Moscow's
subservient allies but now increasingly favoring the alliance's
dissolution.
   About 490 tanks had to be scrapped to be within the Warsaw
Pact's agreed total of 20,000. The Soviet Union agreed to cut its
force by 150, reducing the number of its tanks to 13,150, while the
other nations made corresponding reductions, said Robert Harenciar,
Czechoslovakia's deputy foreign minister.
   Soviet artillery was reduced by 500, he added, without going
into further detail on the negotiations.

   President Bush said Sunday the United States is
not looking for war in the Persian Gulf but vowed to a cheering
military audience that ``we will not walk away'' from the showdown
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``It's clear that the strength of our arms and the strength of
our will is up to the challenge that we all face in the Persian
Gulf,'' he told thousands of members of the armed forces and
dependents at Hickam Air Force Base.
   He assured the families: ``We want every single American home.
No American will be kept in the gulf a single day longer than
necessary, but we will not walk away until our mission is done.''
   Bush has sent more than 200,000 U.S. forces to the gulf to
counter Saddam, whose troops invaded the tiny oil-rich nation of
Kuwait on Aug. 2. Bush has ruled out any concessions for Iraq, and
said as recently as Saturday ``there's nothing to negotiate'' until
Baghdad bows to United Nations resolutions demanding his withdrawal
and setting terms for solving the crisis.
   The speech wrapped up a two-day visit here that blended a GOP
campaign appearance with a meeting with 11 Pacific island leaders.
Bush also found time for jogging, swimming, a catamaran boating
excursion and golf.
   After his speech, Bush flew to San Francisco, where he signed a
stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through
Nov. 5.
   The president will use the intervening days to review the
various appropriations bills Congress has passed for spending in
specific categories, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush signed the stopgap measure after arriving for a political
stop. He is to attend a private fundraiser Monday for Republican
Sen. Pete Wilson's race for governor. He will stop in Oklahoma
later Monday to campaign for GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Price
at the Cowboy Hall of Fame.
   The president, who had spent the weekend in Hawaii, will sign
the deficit reduction package sometime after he returns to
Washington Monday night.
   Bush addressed the crowd at Hickam from a tarmac platform in
front of the gleaming new Air Force One, a blue and white 747 jumbo
jet. The appearance came as the United Nations neared a vote on a
resolution holding Iraq liable for war damages and economic losses.
   Bush said his appearance at Hickam, next to Pearl Harbor,
brought back personal memories from World War II when he was
stationed in the Pacific.
   ``No member of that generation can ever forget the clarion call
that Pearl Harbor represented,'' the president said. ``Things
changed instantly. The country came together. And like you here
today, we each knew our duty.''
   He said the situation in the Persian Gulf is ``a challenge of
perfect clarity ... good and evil, right and wrong.''
   Bush said America's determination in the gulf is unwavering.
   ``America never went looking for a war. But in World War II, the
world paid dearly for appeasing an aggressor who could have been
stopped,'' the president said. ``Appeasement leads only to further
aggression and ultimately to war. And we are not going to make the
mistake of appeasement again.''
   Referring to the deployment of forces to the gulf, Bush said,
``Make no mistake: the decision for this deployment was not made in
Washington. The decision for this deployment was made by the men in
Baghdad.''
   He ticked off an indictment of four crimes that he said are
punishable under international law. ``Saddam Hussein will be held
accountable,'' Bush said.
   ``Iraq has waged a war of aggression, plundered a peaceful
neighbor, held innocents hostage and gassed its own people,'' he
charged.
   In his meeting Saturday with the Pacific island leaders, Bush
pledged that Johnston Island southwest of Hawaii will not be used
as a permanent incinerator for chemical weapons and hazardous
waste. Critics have questioned the facility's safety and
reliability.
   Bush said it would be used only to destroy the 300,000-piece
munition stockpile already stored there and 100,000 nerve gas
artillery shells en route from Germany.
   With $240 million invested in the Johnston plant, the island
leaders appeared resigned to his decision. ``We wish you could tell
us that you would break down (the facility) tomorrow,'' said Cook
Islands Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry. ``We know of course that
cannot be done. That is not sensible.''
   They also expressed skepticism about the administration's
cautious approach about global warming. Bush said he was committed
to a $1 billion annual program to study the issue.

   The 101st Congress was wracked by ethics
scandals and ridiculed for a budget process that seemingly wouldn't
end. But by the time it was over, lawmakers managed to pass
legislation that had eluded enactment for many years.
   ``People ought to take some hope from that process instead of
dumping all over it,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
``We have persevered on a hard, unpleasant, difficult process up to
the very week before election.''
   In its final days before adjournment Sunday - during a time when
all previous Congresses would have been home campaigning - the
101st Congress made its biggest accomplishments:
   -A huge tax hike and spending cut package which, combined with
spending restraint, promises to reduce the federal deficit nearly
$500 billion over the next five years.
   -A child care package including a new grant program and
increased tax credits for low-income families with children.
   -The first overhaul of the federal clean air law in 13 years,
which would require new pollution controls on automobiles,
factories and utilities.
   -The first major revision of the nation's immigration system in
25 years, providing more visas for families and those with special
job skills.
   -Passage of all 13 of the annual spending bills for federal
agencies, none of which was completed by the Oct. 1 deadline. In a
major reversal from the Reagan years, defense spending will be
heading down over the next five years while domestic spending
increases.
   -A five-year farm bill designed to contain costs and address
environmental concerns.
   Congressional leaders held multiple news conferences during the
weekend to boast about those accomplishments and others. They
acknowledged some legislative failures - no major bills on crime,
education, health care or campaign reform.
   But what really marked the 101st Congress was the ugly political
infighting and the ethics scandals.
   ``I think our Congress leaves Washington with a renewed sense of
purpose as it relates to fulfilling our responsibilities to people
who questioned our motives and questioned our integrity,'' said
Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.
   It started last year with Senate rejection of President Bush's
nomination of John Tower for secretary of defense, because of his
reputation as a boozer and womanizer.
   Then there was the pay raise. In round one, a torrent of public
criticism killed a proposed 50 percent boost in congressional
salaries.
   The House became embroiled in a historic ethics scandal that
culminated in the resignations of Speaker Jim Wright and Majority
Whip Tony Coelho. Both were accused of ethical lapses in their
personal finances.
   After taking over as speaker at midyear, Foley parlayed the
demand for tighter ethics rules into a new pay raise plan.
Lawmakers would get a big salary boost if they'd agree to give up
taking special interest money for making speeches.
   The House approved it, while the Senate decided to stick with
the lobbyists' bucks. House salaries, which were $89,500 last year,
will soar to about $125,000 in January, while the Senate will
settle for a cost-of-living adjustment.
   This year, one House member was disciplined and a second forced
to resign in sex scandals. One did favors for a homosexual lover;
the other was convicted of having sex with a teenage girl and was
accused of sexually harassing a congressional employee.
   In the Senate, a group of lawmakers became known as the Keating
Five, all under investigation for their ties to the head of a
failed savings and loan institution.
   Meanwhile, for most of its existence, legislation in this
Congress crawled.
   An attempt at a meaningful bipartisan budget deal last year
collapsed into a nasty, partisan fight over President Bush's
proposed capital gains tax cut.
   Until this month, the biggest legislative successes were an
increase in the federal minimum wage, ending aid to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua, an oil spill prevention bill, and the
Americans With Disabilities Act, giving new rights to people with
impairments.
   Democrats defeated Bush's proposed constitutional amendment to
ban flag burning.
   But the Democratic Congress couldn't overcome the president's
veto of legislation guaranteeing workers six weeks of paid leave
for childbirth or family medical emergencies.
   The 101st Congress never overrode any of 16 Bush vetoes.
   The debate through the spring, summer and into the fall of this
year was dominated by the budget. Even with Bush abandoning his
no-new-taxes pledge, progress was slow.
   Finally, at the end of September the White House and
congressional leaders signed a budget pact calling for a $500
billion reduction in federal deficits over the next five years.
   But rank and file lawmakers of both parties rebelled at the 12
cent gasoline tax, deep cuts in Medicare subsidies, and dozens of
other new fees or service reductions. On Oct. 5, the day Congress
had been scheduled to adjourn, the House killed the deal.
   A government shutdown and legislative chaos ensued. But from the
wreckage, a new package slowly emerged - one less to Bush's liking
but still acceptable to him. It had higher taxes on the wealthy,
only a nickel in new gas taxes, and a lighter hit on Medicare. The
Senate gave it final congressional approval on Saturday.
   With the budget moving, legislators put other bills into place
including the clean air bill, child care, and the long-delayed
annual spending bills.
   They'll be back in January.

<HEAD>U.S. Shifting Support Effort to End in Afghanistan Conflict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is adopting a new tactic in
Afghanistan, reflecting a determination to end one of its last
proxy wars against the Soviet Union.
   Officials and experts say the United States has shifted support
away from the exiled Afghan political leadership in Pakistan to the
rebel commanders inside Afghanistan who are fighting the
Soviet-armed government.
   U.S. officials hope the rebel commanders can break the stalemate
in the fighting and clear the way to a peace agreement with Moscow
and its surrogate government in Kabul.
   The rebels, armed by the United States and Saudi Arabia, have
failed to fulfill predictions they would defeat the Kabul
government after it lost the support of the Soviet troops, who
invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and went home 20 months ago.
   But the commanders recently set up a new council, and earlier
this month 40 commanders from around Afghanistan met to coordinate
an offensive against provincial capitals.
   ``For the first time since the Soviets withdrew, the mujahedeen
(Islamic holy warriors) are pulling together,'' said one U.S.
official.
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union want out of
Afghanistan, just as they are trying to extricate themselves from
supporting rival factions in the protracted civil wars in Cambodia
and Angola.
   ``The United States has made a decision at the highest levels
that we make a deal with the Soviets and get out,'' said Barnett
Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at Columbia University.
   Soviet and U.S. officials say they are near agreement on
Afghanistan but they still differ over what role, if any,
Soviet-installed President Najib will play in an interim
government. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze are scheduled to hold more
talks next month.
   Initially, the United States had high hopes for a seven-faction
Afghan Interim Government set up in Pakistan last year to oversee
rebel operations against Kabul and prepare for a transition to
democratic rule.
   But the administration was forced to re-evaluate due to
continued fighting, divisions among the AIG factions, U.S.
disagreements with Pakistan, and growing pressure from Congress to
cut aid to the rebels.
   The administration now is pinning its hopes on the newly
organized council of guerrilla commanders to put military pressure
on the Kabul government and strengthen the U.S. position at the
bargaining table.
   ``There has definitely been a tilt toward dealing directly with
the commanders,'' said Zalmay Khalilzad, a researcher with the Rand
Corp. and a frequent adviser to the State Department.
   ``They came to the conclusion that the real power lies with the
commanders who control territory,'' he said. ``They matter more
than the political leaders (exiled) in Pakistan.''
   The commanders' council represents broad segments of the
population inside Afghanistan - unlike the AIG, whose constituency
was narrow and generally excluded more secular and liberal
elements, U.S. officials say.
   But the once-solid congressional support for covert aid to the
mujahedeen has cracked. Congress this year cut $30 million from
last year's $280 million covert aid package.
   The Soviets, too, have cut their support for the Afghanistan
government in response to a severe budget crunch: from $5 billion
last year to $2 billion this year, U.S. officials say.
   The administration, which asked for $300 million for the rebels,
argued that now is not the time to let up the pressure on the
Soviets. Continued arming of the rebels, it argued, could help the
commanders win more territory before winter arrives and enhance the
U.S. position at the bargaining table.
   But many supporters of the mujahedeen in Congress doubt the new
strategy will be any more successful than the old one as long as
Pakistan's military intelligence services serve as the conduit for
the weapons.
   Lawmakers who closely follow the Afghan conflict have repeatedly
accused the intelligence service of favoring radical Moslem
factions within the mujahedeen over the more moderate, pro-Western
groups.
   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the most radical of the seven AIG leaders,
has received most of the arms delivered by the Pakistani
intelligence service, congressional sources said.
   The State Department has been pressing the Pakistanis in recent
months to stop playing favorites, the sources said. The urgings
have resulted in increased weapons deliveries to moderates, but
Hekmatyar still receives a disproportionate amount, they said.

   President Bush, noted for his devotion to the
sporting life, did not miss the chance to make his two-night stay
in the nation's island paradise into a rolling opportunity for fun.
   Sandwiched in with the more tedious business of political
fund-raising, conferring with Pacific island leaders and giving a
foreign affairs speech, Bush managed two morning runs on Waikiki
beach and two dips in the ocean, a catamaran cruise out of Honolulu
Harbor and 18 holes of golf at Hickam Air Force Base before leaving
Sunday for San Francisco.
   His dawn outings on the beach at the Hilton Hawaiian Village
hotel attracted dozens of tourists, who tend to rise early in the
balmy climate.
   On Saturday night, Bush gathered about 30 staff members,
political supporters and ambassadors for a twilight cruise on a
catamaran owned by his longtime supporter Fred Zeder, head of the
Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   Bush sported a splashy print Hawaiian shirt and told reporters
that his attire was ``getting very good reviews.''
   He said he had come to the harbor fresh from telephone
conversations with congressional leaders in Washington, who had
finally toiled to a finish on the budget agreement that he has
agreed to sign.
   The chipper, smiling Bush indicated as the catamaran pulled away
from shore that he got the impression the lawmakers weren't having
much fun.
   ``Everyone was very tired - but they're glad'' to be done, he
said.
   The boaters returned after dark, their cruise topped off by an
offshore view of the shimmering Waikiki skyline in the background,
and Bush headed off for dinner in an elegant restaurant.
   On Sunday, after his 6:30 a.m. swim in the ocean, Bush changed
into his golf togs and headed out to Hickam's palm-tree dotted
links by the sea.
   He invited two of the 11 Pacific Island leaders with whom he met
on Saturday - Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry of the Cook Islands and
Fiji Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara.
   Others in the two groups of three were Bush's national security
adviser and frequent golfing buddy, Brent Scowcroft, Zeder and the
commander of U.S. Pacific operations, Adm. Huntington Hardisty.
   Rain began to fall about an hour after they teed off, and Bush's
new partners learned that it takes more than rain to get him to
come in off the course. In any event, the sun returned and they
completed the 18 holes.
   It was unclear whether Henry got the chance to press again his
public comments of Saturday, when he said the pool of good will
islanders felt toward the United States had begun to dry up since
World War II.
   He also spoke of a ``gulf of misunderstanding and
misinformation'' on the issue of global warming, a matter of great
concern to the islands because any rise in the ocean caused by
fossil fuels warming the Earth's atmosphere would greatly affect
their lives.
   While some scientists predict harmful climate changes and other
effects from global warming, the Bush administration notes other
scientists say the trend is not firmly proven and that more study
is needed before dramatic action is taken.

<TEXT>
   The final budget that emerged from Congress
has such a strong Democratic stamp that it will remind Republicans
for years to come of the perils of saying ``no.''
   The House GOP abandoned President Bush when he asked for its
votes three weeks ago for a bipartisan deal. Democrats also
rejected their leaders' appeals, as a majority of both parties in
the House voted against it.
   So both Bush and the Democratic leaders who participated in the
budget summit were embarrassed. The difference was the House
Democrats knew where they could look for votes.
   ``This was not rocket science,'' said a top Democratic aide.
``The (budget) summitteers knew the defects of the package.''
   They reduced the Medicare cuts of $60 billion nearly in half.
Ditto the proposed increase in the gasoline tax. They eliminated a
proposed tax on home heating oil and a two-week delay in
unemployment benefits.
   In their place were inserted big new levies on the wealthy which
fit in perfectly with some well-practiced ``soak-the-rich''
rhetoric.
   ``We have to change the debate from tax (increases) to who gets
taxed and the fairness of it,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt.
   With recession fears high, what the class-conscious debate
Democrats had been trying for years suddenly worked.
   The White House, meantime, was hamstrung.
   It was too late for a veto strategy. The next best tool for
moderating the package, Republican votes, was taken away by deep
divisions between those willing to accept some taxes to cut the
deficit, and those who wouldn't.
   ``I see 50 (members) on my side, on the extreme right, who
wouldn't vote to tax prostitution,'' said Rep. Robert Michel,
R-Ill., the House GOP leader. ``When we're a divided minority
party, we've got no strength at all.''
   Michel's deputy, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., led
the opposition to the original, bipartisan plan. For members of a
minority party used to saying ``no,'' his was an easy position to
accept.
   But this time it backfired.
   When the final package was shoved down their throats with even
more taxes - skewed in favor of the Democrats' constituency - some
lawmakers began referring to the difference as ``the Newt tax.''
   ``Without Gingrich, this budget could have been a setback rather
than an uplift,'' the Democratic aide said.
   The final negotiation necessarily moderated the Democratic plan,
since in the Senate both Democratic and Republican votes were
needed for passage. And there was a lot of vote-buying at the end;
for example, dropping a provision that forces public employees in a
handful of holdout states to enroll in Medicare.
   But with the unwitting help of Republican renegades, the
Democrats won a shift away from the policies of the Reagan years.
   Everyone pays, but the focus of the tax increases is on the
wealthy. There are Medicare cuts, but not nearly so deep as Bush
proposed. Medicaid, the health program for the poor, is expanded.
Domestic programs will grow while the Pentagon's share of the pie
shrinks.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Democrats
had managed to ``stop a trend that started in the past decade and
began to reverse it.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., heralded ``a new era in
dealing with fiscal problems in the country.''
   Of course, Republicans who voted against the plan will find
plenty in it to attack, including tax boosts for beer and gasoline,
Medicare premium hikes, and income tax increases for the wealthy.
   Out campaigning for Republican candidates, Bush has been
attacking the very plan that he will sign into law.
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., compared Bush's stance to the old
comedy routine of Flip Wilson. ``The devil made me do it! The devil
made me do it!'' said Wilson's character Geraldine.
   All because the Republicans would only say ``no,'' Bush was
forced to accept more taxes on the wealthy, fewer cuts in Medicare,
a smaller gas tax increase, and numerous other changes from the
original package.
   ``Mr. President, the Democrats made you do it,'' Levin said.

<TEXT>
   The federal budget mess couldn't have come
at a better time for Democrat Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., who wants
to be Ohio's next governor.
   Celebrezze, the state attorney general, has trailed Republican
George Voinovich, the popular former mayor of Cleveland, throughout
the campaign.
   But now Celebrezze is gaining ground as he ties Voinovich to the
unpopular Washington establishment and to a Republican Party the
Democrats painted as the protector of the rich in the month-long
budget battle.
   ``It gets to what I've been saying that in Washington, for the
last 10 years, people have been creating a very wealthy class in
this country, and then the rest of us,'' Celebrezze says.
   Voinovich rejects the idea that the president's problems are
rubbing off on him. He says the public is blaming Democrats and
Republicans alike for the disarray in Washington.
   ``George Bush is not hurting me one bit,'' Voinovich said. ``The
general public ... thinks that they're all not being very
responsible right now.''
   Independent polls have showed Voinovich holding a double-digit
lead through most of the race. But Celebrezze last week said his
internal polls showed him in the lead. A GOP poll put Celebrezze
within 4 percentage points.
   A Gallup poll released Sunday showed Voinovich was favored by 47
percent of those surveyed and Celebrezze by 39 percent, with 14
percent undecided. The survey, sponsored by The Blade of Toledo and
TV stations WTOL in Toledo and WLIO in Lima, had a margin of error
of 4 percentage points.
   Pollsters said interviews with respondents to the Gallup poll
suggested that Celebrezze has gained in popularity as public
resentment toward the Bush administration has grown.
   But Voinovich spokesman Curt Steiner said GOP polls offer no
evidence that the Democratic attack has hurt Voinovich.
   ``We are still getting half of the blue collar vote,'' he said.
   His campaign strategy has been to tie Celebrezze to alleged
corruption and mismanagement during the eight-year tenure of
Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste, who was barred from seeking
re-election.
   ``The Celeste-Celebrezze administration is the most corrupt,
scandal-ridden, unethical in our memory,'' Voinovich said at a
recent debate.
   At one debate, Voinovich told Celebrezze there was ``a right way
and a wrong way'' to manage state government.
   ``Tony, I want to say to you, you and Dick Celeste have done it
wrong for the last eight years,'' he said.
   Celebrezze's new populist theme includes attacks on a string of
fancy Voinovich fund-raisers featuring Bush and other GOP
luminaries.
   Taking a swipe at one $25,000-per-couple Bush fund-raiser,
Celebrezze asked a crowd at a union rally: ``How many people in
this room make over $200,000 a year? How many people in this room
can afford to write a check for $25,000 to spend 20 minutes with
George Bush?''
   Voinovich, 54, has proved himself adept at capturing Democratic
votes during 10 years as mayor of Cleveland in heavily Democratic
Cuyahoga County. He is credited with helping to pull Cleveland out
of a financial morass and revitalize its downtown.
   Abortion has been the single biggest point of difference between
the two candidates. Celebrezze last December abandoned his
long-held opposition to abortion and said women should have the
right to choose.
   Voinovich opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a
threat to the life of the mother.
   He has criticized Celebrezze for flip-flopping. ``Isn't it
unbelievable what some politicians will do to get voters?'' one
Voinovich ad asks.
   Voinovich last week was mentioned as a possible successor to
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who is resigning. Democrats seized
on the reports as a chance to suggest Voinovich's campaign could be
in trouble.
   ``We thought it was very nice for President Bush to offer our
opponent a consolation prize two weeks before the election,'' said
Celebrezze spokeswoman Melinda Swan.
   Voinovich said his campaign knew nothing about the search for
possible successors to Mrs. Dole.
   His campaign said Sunday that Voinovich had picked up additional
newspaper endorsements, giving Voinovich the support of all the
state's largest newspapers and many smaller dailies and weeklies.
   The Ohio race is one of 14 gubernatorial contests around the
country that are too close to call. The others are in California,
Texas, Florida, Alabama, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Kansas, Maine,
Illinois, Vermont, Alaska, Oregon and Oklahoma.

<HEAD>Private Banks Sending USDA Bill For Guaranteed Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private banks have begun asking the
Agriculture Department to make good on $2 billion worth of credit
guarantees for the sale of wheat, rice and other commodities to
Iraq.
   Not all of the $2 billion is coming due at once, however. The
loans are spread out, some of them running through 1995 or later.
   The guarantees mostly involve two ``export credit'' programs
called GSM-102 and GSM-103 that are operated by USDA to boost sales
of farm products to selected overseas buyers.
   Unlike concessional or long-term programs such as Food for
Peace, these are for shorter periods involving commercial loans
underwritten by private banks.
   The GSM-102 program provides credit and repayment over six
months to three years. A wide variety of U.S. farm products are
exported to dozens of foreign countries with these arrangements.
   Under GSM-103, an intermediate program, loans can run from three
to 10 years and focus on products with longer economic lifetimes,
such as breeding livestock.
   The programs are backed up by the department's Commodity Credit
Corp. and are administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service. The
CCC also is the financing agency for all federal commodity support
programs.
   No money is lent directly by the department. Once a country is
approved for the guarantee, private lenders and exporters work out
a plan with the foreign buyer, subject to USDA approval.
   Larry McElvain, director of CCC operations for the Foreign
Agricultural Service, said claims ``are coming in now every day''
from lenders who want their payments for grain sold to Iraq.
   No estimate of the number of credit guarantee claims or amounts
was readily available.
   ``What you want to understand about the claims is that we don't
just pay out the $2 billion'' all at once, he said. ``That is
because (lenders) can't file a claim until it comes due.''
   Iraq had been buying U.S. farm commodities with credit
guarantees since 1983 and had ``an excellent'' record of repayment,
McElvain said.
   ``There has never been a claim filed or paid on Iraq until this
situation here,'' he said.
   ``This situation'' began Aug. 2 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. As a
result, President Bush severed all trade with Baghdad, including
further credit sales of farm commodities.
   The annual credit line under the guarantee program was at a peak
of slightly more than $1 billion in fiscal 1989. For 1990, the year
that ended Sept. 30, Iraq had been cleared for $500 million, with
another $500 million available, subject to further review.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Moderately strong demand for high-protein meal
and vegetable oil is helping bolster soybean prices this season,
according to Agriculture Department analysts.
   A major factor, however, is the size of the 1990 soybean
harvest, currently estimated at 1.82 billion bushels, a slight
decline from 1989 output.
   ``Overall, yields (bushels per acre) are expected to be near
average and about the same as last year's,'' the department's
Economic Research Service said in a recent outlook report.
``Accounting for the drop in production is a reduction in acreage
planted in 1990 - more than three million under the 1989 level.''
   Soybean use in the 1990-91 marketing year that began Sept. 1 is
expected to be up slightly from last season. The total crush by
processors to make meal and oil is estimated at 1.18 billion
bushels, up 3 percent, the report said. Exports of beans are
expected to drop slightly this season to 615 million bushels.
   The domestic use of soybean meal in 1990-91 is expected to rise
further from last season's record level.
   ``A profitable livestock production outlook aided by moderate
grain prices should boost meal use,'' the report said. ``In the
export market, expected soybean meal sales to the Soviet Union and
Latin America account for a nearly 10 percent surge in exports over
last year to 5.5 million tons.''
   The domestic use of soybean oil is forecast to match last year's
record, although oil exports are expected to trail 1989-90, the
report said.
   Economists projected the farm price of soybeans in 1990-91 at an
average of $5.70 to $7 per bushel, up $5.70 last marketing year.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's hens produced an estimated 5.53
billion eggs in September, according to a monthly report by the
Agriculture Department.
   An average of 268 million layers were at work during the month,
a fractional increase from September 1989. Those birds averaged
2,062 eggs per 100 layers, compared with 2,037 a year earlier, the
report said.

were arrested and 14 people were injured.
   The rally at the Capitol on Sunday was the second in as many
months. More than 5,000 officers from three police departments
prevented a few thousand counter-demonstrators from coming
face-to-face with the Klansmen.
   Six protesters were treated at a local hospital for minor
injuries, according to local police.
   Eight police officers were hurt, most suffering minor injuries
in confrontations with the counter-demonstrators, said city police
spokesman Sgt. Joe Gentile. A female officer suffered a serious
neck injury when she was struck by a rock, according to Ed Wilson,
another police spokesman.
   Gentile said the Metropolitan Police arrested 40 demonstrators.
Three others were held by the U.S. Capitol Police on charges of
disorderly conduct, demonstrating after revocation of a permit and
disobeying the orders of a police officer, said spokesman Dan
Nichols.
   ``We knew this was going to happen,'' District Police Chief
Isaac Fulwood Jr. said at a news conference afterward. Referring to
a federal judge who rejected a city bid to restrict the march to a
shorter path, he added, ``We thought that the judge erred. I
thought he used poor judgment.''
   Several officers struck counter-demonstrators with clubs, but
Fulwood said he did not believe they used excessive force. None of
the Klan members was hurt.
   ``K-K-K, we're here to stay,'' shouted the Klansmen as they
marched the 11-block route from the Washington Monument to the
Capitol.
   Even before the march began, police dressed in riot gear along
Constitution Avenue were pelted with bottles, cans and sticks by
counter-demonstrators.
   The counter-demonstrators chanted slogans including ``Hey, get
down, we're going to run the Klan out of town.''
   At the Capitol, a Klan leader exhorted his followers to remove
from office all senators and representatives who voted to override
President Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990.
   ``They tried to override the veto, but thank God it was kept out
of law,'' an unidentified Klansman said during the 30-minute rally.
``Vote the hypocrites out,'' he added.
   Virgil Griffin of Shelby, N.C., leader of the Christian Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, said he was pleased with his group's success.
   ``We've done good,'' Griffin said.
   He criticized police for not arresting counter-demonstrators who
confronted police along the march route.
   ``They should have arrested the people making threats against
the Klan,'' he said. ``They would have arrested me if I made
threats against the Communist Party.''
   The Capitol Police deployed ``just about every uniformed
officer'' in its ranks, about 800, to the four-block perimeter
surrounding the rally site, said Nichols.
   Officials said all 4,750 city police officers were dispatched
Sunday at an estimated cost of $800,000. They were assisted by
about 300 U.S. Park Police and some National Guardsmen who directed
traffic around areas blocked by police.
   On Labor Day weekend, D.C. police escorted 44 Klan members to
the Capitol grounds where they held a rally.
   Earlier this week, police said they couldn't guarantee the
safety of the marchers if they walked to the Capitol from the
Washington Monument. City officials went to court to try to
restrict the marchers to a path along the perimeter of the Mall
around the Washington Monument.
   But after the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the city
on constitutional grounds, U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer
ordered the march to proceed along Constitution.
   The city won a temporary reversal of that order Saturday when a
three-judge appellate panel sent the matter back to Oberdorfer, but
he reaffirmed his order.

<HEAD>Crimes Motivated by Prejudice Likely to Increase as Economy
Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crimes motivated by racial, religious and
cultural prejudice are increasing and likely will escalate faster
if the nation's economy continues to deteriorate, experts say.
   ``As economic conditions decline, the civility of society
declines also,'' Jeffrey Ross, director of campus affairs for the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, told a conference of the
Washington Journalism Center.
   ``At the very least things will get worse before they get
better,'' he said.
   Ross said the league received reports of anti-Semitic incidents
on six college and university campuses in 1984 and the figure
increased to 51 in 1989.
   ``Things seem to be heating up,'' he said.
   Other experts at the conference agreed that incidents of bigotry
are increasing and are likely to be stimulated by a declining
economy.
   Some attribute it to the pressure of competition for jobs among
blacks, whites and other racial or religious groups.
   ``The increase in anti-Semitism is clearly related to an
increase in bigotry in general on campus,'' Ross said. ``You also
have increased numbers of assaults upon blacks, upon Hispanics,
upon Asians, upon gays and lesbians.''
   He said most of the anti-Semitic crimes were directed against
property, whereas the assaults on gays and lesbians were against
people.
   Adele D. Terrell, acting executive director of the
Baltimore-based National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence,
said, ``We don't know how much of it goes on. We just know there is
a lot of it. We know there appears to be an increase.''
   ``We are in very tight economic times,'' Ms. Terrell said. ``We
know that the blue collar jobs just aren't there. Whenever we have
tight economic times, we have scapegoating and blaming. We know
that we've got lots and lots of immigrants coming into this
country, and historically each and every wave of immigrants that
has ever come into the United States has been greeted by violence.
   ``There is lots and lots of violence motivated by prejudice,
lots and lots of harassment motivated by prejudice, and my feeling
is that given our demographic and economic circumstances it cannot
help but increase,'' she said.
   ``Most of these incidents are perpetrated by individuals or
small informal groups of individuals,'' she said. ``The majority of
the acts are not, in our opinion, committed by organized hate
groups.''
   Steven Salmony, a psychologist from Chapel Hill, N.C., who has
studied the Ku Klux Klan and similar groups, said their activity
may also be bolstered in economic hard times.
   ``I am concerned that the financial uncertainty and the economic
insecurity might cause some especially vulnerable people to turn to
groups like the Klan for support, for protection, for security,''
he said. ``This is a distinct possibility.''
   Jack McDevitt, associate director of the Center for Applied
Social Research at Northeastern University in Boston, said, ``There
are hundreds of thousands of people who feel some resentment, and
when to this resentment we add in the economic difficulties we are
going through, it can lead to a variety of intolerant acts. People
really feel threatened, and they are looking for a way to do
something about it.''
   He said raciall motivated incidents may increase in Boston this
year after several years of declining or remaining steady, and ``I
fear it is the beginning of a trend.''
   ``It is poor whites against poor blacks, and that is where the
friction is coming from,'' he said.
   Lisa Navarette, public information director of the Hispanic
rights group National Council of La Raza, said, ``There is a
feeling among blacks that immigrants take jobs away from blacks and
that this lowers wages. This has fortified the anti-Hispanic
sentiment in the black community.''
   She said La Raza is worried that this will intensify ``as the
economy worsens and if we do go into a recession.''
   ``There is a real correlation between downturns in the economy
and anti-immigrant feeling,'' Ms. Navarette said.

<HEAD>Congress Approves New Child Care Aid, Immigration Law Revision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 750,000 children will be helped in
the first year of a new system of federal grants and higher tax
credits for child care, say sponsors of the program approved as
Congress adjourned for the year.
   The child care benefits were part of a massive budget agreement
completed before lawmakers left Washington for the campaign trail
early Sunday. Also completed in the session's waning hours were a
major immigration law rewrite, a foreign aid bill, watered-down
crime legislation and a ban on offshore oil drilling.
   The child care bill marked the first time since World War II
that the federal government has supported child care for working
parents outside of welfare and employment programs, said Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., one of its authors.
   It also will require states to establish health, safety,
registration and quality requirements. Church-run day care centers
will be eligible for the federal subsidies, a recognition that
churches play an important role in child care in many areas.
   In other major legislation, Congress approved a substantial
boost in the number of immigrants who will be allowed into the
United States each year.
   The bill, the first major rewrite of immigration law in a
quarter-century, would boost the current limit of 490,000 a year on
legal immigrants to 645,000 in each fiscal year through 1994, and
675,000 thereafter.
   The measure keeps reuniting families as its primary test, but
also would open the door to foreigners with special skills, those
who are wealthy and even some shunned for years for political or
medical reasons.
   President Bush on Sunday night signed a stopgap spending measure
to keep the government operating through Nov. 5. He will use the
intervening days to review specific bills approved by Congress,
Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush signed the stopgap measure after arriving for a political
stop in San Francisco.
   The president, who had spent the weekend in Hawaii, will sign
the deficit reduction package sometime after he returns to
Washington Monday night.
   As they ran for the exits, lawmakers also:
   -Slashed military aid to El Salvador, hoping to pressure the
Salvadoran government and leftist FMLN rebels to negotiate an end
to their 10-year war. President Bush said he will sign the $15.5
billion foreign aid bill that includes the restrictions, apparently
because it also includes $6.7 billion in debt forgiveness for Egypt
as a reward for its leadership in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   -Voted 313-1 for a stripped-down anti-crime bill, leaving out
contentious issues like the death penalty and a ban on assault
weapons. Left in were provisions toughening penalties for certain
white-collar crimes, including possible life terms for certain
savings and loan fraud cases. The bill also for the first time
makes possession of child pornography a federal offense.
   -Banned offshore oil drilling along coastlines from Alaska to
New England for another year. The moratorium on offshore oil leases
along thousands of miles of coast was in the 1991 spending bill for
the Interior Department.
   -Endorsed a mildly worded admonition against obscene art. The
provision governing the National Endowment for the Arts ended
efforts to take more stringent action, including banning federal
support for works that denigrate religious symbols or beliefs.
   -Approved a new departure fee of up to $3 for airline
passengers, which could add as much as $12 to a round-trip ticket
that includes connecting stops. The provision also would require
air carriers to retire their noisiest jetliners by the end of the
decade.

<HEAD>Republican Candidates Distancing Selves From Bush, Budget Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With voters angry and their party plummeting
in the polls, Republicans who face congressional elections a week
from now are running hard - away from their president.
   ``I don't like to go against what the president is saying,''
said Rep. Tom Tauke, a Republican who is running for the Senate in
Iowa. ``But my judgment is that, in this case, the president has a
different job than I have.''
   GOP candidates who share Tauke's task - getting elected - are
trying to put as much daylight as possible between themselves and
the Republican occupant of the White House.
   The focal point for conflict is the $496 billion budget package
Congress approved this weekend before adjourning to the campaign
trail. The five-year deficit reduction bill, which President Bush
has said he will sign, includes $137 billion in new taxes and the
rest in spending cuts and reduced interest payments on the debt.
   But that mix isn't sitting well at home, Tauke said in an
appearance Sunday on CBS's ``Face the Nation.'' Iowans ``certainly
aren't interested in sending a whole lot more money to
Washington,'' he said.
   In Nebraska, GOP Senate candidate Hal Daub wasted no time in
attacking the package. ``This new budget will give Nebraskans an
idea of how a small country feels being overrun by a larger
power,'' he said.
   And Rep. Claudine Schneider, a Republican running for the Senate
in Rhode Island, was asked how she felt about Bush's inability to
make another trip to her state to campaign for her before Nov. 6.
``That's fine,'' she said.
   Schneider said voters ``are going to vote for me, not for the
president, in this next race. And so they do see the distance
between the two of us.''
   Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, admitted the deficit
reduction package approved by Congress on Saturday was not popular
but said it was needed nonetheless.
   ``It's regrettable that it's come in the middle of an
election,'' Darman said. ``But the president is doing the right
thing.''
   Darman and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu turned to a
tried-and-true line of attack: blaming Democrats for tax hikes in
the new budget and crediting Republicans for the spending cuts.
   Sununu called the tax increase ``ransom'' that Bush had to pay
to Democrats to get the spending cuts he wanted, conceding that it
had temporarily hurt the president's popularity.
   ``He cashed in some of his political capital for the benefit of
the country,'' he said on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   But making that argument is complicated by Bush's acceptance of
both aspects of the five-year, $496 billion budget deal reached
just before the 101st Congress left town for the campaign trail.
   Democrats moved quickly to tie the knot linking Bush to the deal
even tighter. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., noted
in the waning moments of the congressional session that Bush has
``seemed ambivalent and then angry'' about the budget package.
   ``The public should not be confused by the president: He was a
central player when this budget was written, and it would never
have gone forward without his approval of every item in it,''
Gephardt said. The comment was a pointed reminder that Bush had
abandoned his no-new-taxes pledge last summer.
   And Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown, also
appearing on ABC, pounded home his party's fairness theme.
Democrats shaped the tax package to put more of the burden on the
wealthy, ``the only ones who really made out'' during the 1980s, he
said.
   ``Because Democrats have been in the Congress fighting, the
middle class ended up better off'' with the new budget, Brown
contended.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, who has campaigned widely for
Republicans in recent weeks, said he senses Americans ``are fed up
to here'' with government and incumbents, and predicted that will
work for the GOP on Election Day.
   ``I think you're going to see a major sea change in this
election because people have had it,'' Quayle said on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press.'' ``The Democratic Congress has a lot of
explaining to do.''
   But the difficulty came when Quayle sought to defend Bush as a
successful president by citing a list of accomplishments, all of
which Congress either was closely involved in or approved of:
deficit reduction, a rewrite of the Clean Air Act, Persian Gulf
policy, democracy in Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Mine Workers Hope to Work on Political Problems from Inside</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PAXTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers members, tired of
working from the outside, are trying to get inside the legislatures
of West Virginia, Alabama and Illinois.
   The UMW traditionally has supported candidates through its Coal
Miners Political Action Committee and has been a lobbying force in
some coal states.
   But this year brings a new strategy for dealing with politics
from the inside.
   ``I know the ins and outs of the state legislative body,'' said
Gene Claypole, a Mine Workers district president and a candidate
for the West Virginia Senate.
   ``It seems that we have quite a few attorneys that are elected
to those positions and quite a few businessmen elected to those
positions. And I saw labor on the outside,'' he said.
   ``We need to have somebody from the working class to present the
views of the workers. I don't know anybody who would represent
labor any better than somebody in labor,'' Claypole said.
   Two other Mine Workers members are running for the West Virginia
House of Delegates and two more are running for re-election to the
state House.
   Two UMW members also are running for the state House in Alabama
and one is running for the Illinois House. All the UMW candidates
are Democrats.
   The campaigns follow last year's surprising victory by District
28 President Jackie Stump in Virginia, who won a last-minute
write-in campaign as an independent for the state's House of
Delegates.
   He defeated longtime Rep. Donald McGlothlin Sr., the father of a
circuit judge who had fined the UMW heavily for activities during
the Pittston coal strike.
   At last month's UMW convention in Florida, union leaders urged
members to become involved in state politics, pointing to the
success of Canada's labor-affiliated New Democratic Party, which
has sent several union members to Parliament.
   The UMW is hoping for the same success in this country to enact
a national health care plan and a law prohibiting companies from
hiring permanent replacement workers during a strike.
   The new political goal was ratified in a report adopted by UMW
delegates at Miami Beach.
   ``The delegates said that basically if there isn't a candidate
in either party willing to stand up for the working men and women
of this country, they will seek through all appropriate channels
candidates outside of those parties who are willing to stand up for
those working men and women and their rights,'' said union
spokeswoman Kirsty Smith.
   UMW members also are becoming more actively involved in local
races, running for county and city posts, Smith said.
   ``The union's looking at political involvement at all levels and
they're looking for politicians who are going to live up to their
campaign promises to help working men and women,'' Smith said.

<HEAD>Five Candidates Certified to Run for Lukens' Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMILTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five candidates are certified to run in a
special election to fill the last few weeks of Ohio Republican
Donald Lukens' term in the U.S. House.
   The Butler County Board of Elections on Sunday certified the
petitions of four Republicans and one Democrat who filed for the
special primary vote on Nov. 6. A special general election for the
remainder of Lukens' term is scheduled for Nov. 21.
   Lukens resigned last week to avoid an investigation of a new
allegation of sexual misconduct. He was convicted last year of
contributing to the unruliness of a minor who said she had sex with
him.
   Lukens lost his re-election bid last May, so he would have been
leaving Congress in January even if he had not resigned. Gov.
Richard Celeste ordered a special election last week to fill the
rest of this term.
   The candidates running for the unexpired term include Republican
John Boehner and Democrat Greg Jolivette, who also are running for
the term that begins in January.
   Celeste's order for a special election was required under state
law, even though Congress is not expected to meet in November or
December. Officials in Washington have said that Lukens' interim
successor will be paid, but likely will not be sworn into office.

<HEAD>Election Could Create Mother-Son Team in Missouri Senate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKSVILLE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Missouri Sen. Pat Danner remembers taking
her first legislative oath in 1983 with a politician's pride and a
mother's misery.
   She was missing the simultaneous swearing-in of her son, Steve,
as a freshman Missouri representative.
   Mrs. Danner hopes to stand side by side with her son in January
when state senators are sworn in for the next term.
   ``At work, we'll be senators, with senatorial courtesy,'' Mrs.
Danner says. ``After work, we'll be mother and son.''
   The younger Danner first must turn back a hard-fought
re-election bid by Republican Sen. David Doctorian. The incumbent
says his polls show him leading Danner.
   The National Conference of State Legislatures says Steve
Danner's election would create the United States' only mother and
son combination in a legislative chamber.
   ``I don't see any problems following in my mother's footsteps,''
says Steve Danner. ``Fathers and sons do it all the time. It
shouldn't be anything strange.''

<HEAD>Poll Shows GOP Candidates Favored in NH Governor, Senate Races</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican candidates for governor and
the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire have the edge over their
Democratic challengers, according to a poll of likely voters.
   In the gubernatorial race, GOP Gov. Judd Gregg was favored over
Democrat Joe Grandmaison, 61 percent to 28 percent.
   For the U.S. Senate, 51 percent favored U.S. Rep. Bob Smith,
compared to 35 percent for former U.S. Sen. John Durkin, a
Democrat.
   The poll, which had a 4 percentage point margin of error, was
published in the Boston Sunday Globe. The survey of 600 likely
voters was conducted last week by KRC Communications Research of
Newton, Mass.
   The survey found a closer race between House candidates Bill
Zeliff, a Republican, and Democrat Joe Keefe. Thirty-eight percent
of those surveyed favored Zeliff and 32 percent backed Keefe, with
29 percent undecided. That margin of error for that race was 6
percentage points.
   The two candidates are vying for Smith's House seat.

   The dollar was weaker against the yen in Tokyo on
Monday, while share prices firmed.
   The dollar closed at 127.35 yen, down 1.15 yen from Friday's
128.50-yen finish. It opened at 127.45 yen and ranged narrowly
between 127.25 yen and 127.65 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 25,329.31, up
323.67 points or 1.29 percent from Friday's close of 25,005.64.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was trading at 84.99 points, up from
Friday's close of 84.25. Their yield was 7.700 percent, down from
7.870 percent.
   Persian Gulf crude oil prices were higher. Dubai Crude oil for
December delivery was valued at $29.20-$29.30 a barrel, or about $1
above the level in New York late Friday.
   Dealers said the dollar's slide was due in part to diplomatic
moves seeking a peaceful settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis,
including a meeting in Paris between Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and French President Francois Mitterrand, said Minori
Takeuchi of Chemical Bank.
   On the stock market, dealers attributed the rise in share prices
to a recovering yen and firmer bond prices that kept the market
mood calm, despite some concern about overseas stocks, which were
weak Friday.

   The accidental shooting death of a young
stockbroker by an officer looking for a burglar is one more strike
against a police force already struggling with allegations of
brutality and racism.
   Terry D. Barnes, 24, was shot between the eyes in his apartment.
Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had
entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out
of bed to see what was wrong.
   It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police
officers this year. In the previous three years, five people were
shot and killed.
   ``I just hope that this case will draw the line on where the
police can kill an innocent man. Where do you draw the line?'' said
roommate Andy Brez, 23, who was sleeping in another bedroom when
police entered on Saturday.
   Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other
recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black
citizens.
   Police said they were told the prowler might have run to the
floor on which Barnes lived. Two police officers, whose names were
not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly
shut and entered, authorities said.
   An officer encountered Barnes, unarmed, in a T-shirt and boxer
shorts, standing in his bedroom, police spokesman Sgt. Greg Mills
said. Barnes made ``a kind of lunging motion,'' and the officer
fired from about 5 to 8 feet, Mills said.
   Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar
and whether he would have lunged at the officer.
   ``We are defending the officers being in that apartment,'' Mills
said. ``As for the shooting itself, we will make no assessment of
the propriety of that until after the investigation.''
   The department has suffered a string of complaints about
excessive force and racism since the spring. Police Chief Steven
Bishop said before the latest slaying that the department's
standing has fallen in the community, and a ``behavior
modification'' program is being developed for offending officers.
   ``We're part of the problem out there on the street, and we've
got to get back to good, basic police work,'' Bishop said after
Barnes' death.
   In June, several white officers bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman
Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the ground. The Rev.
Joseph Okoye said officers who stopped him on suspicion of drunken
driving mistook his foreign accent for drunken speech.
   In May, another black clergyman was hit on the head with a
shotgun by a white officer while lying on the ground. Police said a
youth in the car of the Rev. William Fountaine matched the
description of an armed robber.
   Neither clergyman nor the passenger in Fountaine's car was
charged. Both clergymen alleged racism; Bishop suspended some of
the officers involved in the May incident.
   In another case, three undercover officers were suspended for a
shooting this spring that left a young black man crippled. The
officers and the victim accused each other of starting the fight
that led to the shooting.
   Also this year, four oficers riddled a man brandishing a
barbecue fork with 15 bullets, killing him. And an officer killed a
man who was spraying him with a fire extinguisher. No officer
involved in the two killings was charged.
   The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force.
He was placed on paid leave pending a police investigation and that
of a grand jury.
   ``This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr.
Barnes' family and for this officer,'' Bishop said. ``The officers
were reacting appropriately to a number of circumstances which
together led them to that apartment.''
   ``Terry was a good man. He would have been a good husband and a
good father,'' said Barnes' fiancee, Alison Brady. They had planned
to marry in June.

   The red berets are back.
   They stand at street corners and patrol outside the hotels and
at the Pyramids, sidearms wrapped in white holsters - a reminder
that the Persian Gulf crisis could erupt in terror in Cairo at any
time.
   Egypt, often accused of talking a lot but doing little about its
problems, seems to be taking security seriously since the country's
parliament speaker was assassinated on a downtown street Oct. 12.
   The red berets are military police.
   They were last seen on the streets of this city of 12 million in
February 1986, after the army suppressed riots by police draftees
angered by rumors that their tours of duty had been lengthened.
   Special police security units are also out in force, wearing
black uniforms and combat helmets. Traffic policemen are wearing
sidearms again. Purses are searched at the entrances to floating
restaurants on the Nile.
   Many Egyptians began to worry about terrorist attacks early in
August, when President Hosni Mubarak committed troops to the
Persian Gulf to check Iraq, which had just invaded Kuwait.
   But there were few visible signs that the threat of attack -
from Iraqi, Palestinian or Islamic fundamentalist agents - was
being taken seriously.
   More worrisome was the economy.
   Egypt faced losses estimated at $4.5 billion in the form of a
ruined tourism industry, reduced Suez Canal revenues and lost
remittances from an estimated 500,000 Egyptians who had to return
home from the gulf.
   The financial picture has brightened somewhat. Egypt's U.S. and
Arab allies are moving to write off $14 billion in debts, aid worth
hundreds of millions of dollars is pouring in, and there are good
prospects for agreement with the International Monetary Fund to
reschedule the remaining foreign debt.
   But security suddenly took the forefront on Oct. 1, when gunmen
ambushed Rifaat el-Mahgoub, killing the speaker, his driver and
five security men.
   So far at least 10 suspects have been arrested on suspicion of
involvement in el-Mahgoub's murder. Two other suspects were shot to
death in a street gunbattle on Saturday.
   Police have ordered security checks at hotels in the downtown
area, near where el-Mahgoub was assassinated. Security trucks now
guard entrances and exits at sporting clubs frequented by diplomats
and foreigners. Police details have been reinforced at Cairo
American College, an international school in Maadi, at the Sphinx
and Giza Pyramids.
   But traditions of lax security die hard.
   The opposition newspaper El-Wafd reported last week that its
reporter and a photographer talked their way through Cairo
International Airport checkpoints and walked up the gangway, and
into the cockpit of an empty airliner.
   Government newspapers the next day reported a new program of
television monitors and other security steps.

   Kuwaitis are counting on war to end the
terror of life under Iraq's occupying forces, a refugee says.
   ``It is not only the brutal Iraqi treatment or the doings of the
Iraqi death squads that makes us terrified to step out of our
homes,'' he said Sunday. ``The very living is horrible
desolation.''
   The man, a public employee in his mid-30s, arrived in Bahrain
after leaving via Saudi Arabia last week. He spoke on condition of
anonymity to prevent reprisals against friends left behind.
   The man, who said he had lost 30 pounds since the invasion, sent
his wife and children out a month earlier but stayed on until he
could no longer stand it.
   ``From the very young to the very old, we all hoped for war,''
the Kuwaiti said. ``We don't mind dying, we want the hell ended.''
   Iraqis control government offices and schools, and many Kuwaitis
refuse to go to work or send their children to school, he said.
   He said resistance has died down in the city but continued on
its fringes.
   ``Resistance was of two types, and the enthusiastic youth have
been destroyed since about a month ago by torture and killing,'' he
said. ``Now it is the second type, an underground resistance that
goes for ambushes of military posts in the desert.''
   Underground fighters are well aware of the risks, he said. Iraqi
death squads bring young men they suspect of resistance acts to
their family homes, call the family members out ``and then shoot
the youth in the head, heart and foot, and leave the dead bodies at
their feet.''
   He said the number of Iraqi troops had declined in the heart of
the city. The number of checkpoints also had decreased and some
mines had been removed from facilities.
   ``But what does it mean? I can't tell,'' he said.
   ``The Iraqis are very tricky. One Iraqi soldier will tell a
Kuwaiti, `Look, I am removing a mine as we are leaving.' Another
Iraqi soldier will tell another Kuwaiti, `We will never leave
Kuwait.'''

<HEAD>Trial to Determine Who Owns Jack Ruby's Gun</HEAD>

   The gun Jack Ruby used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald
is at the center of a nearly 24-year-old dispute on the court
docket this week.
   A trial was to begin today in Probate Court to determine
distribution of Ruby's assets and consider a petition to remove
Jules Mayer as executor of his will.
   The most valuable asset by far is the .38-caliber Colt Cobra
revolver that Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner, used to kill the
assassin of President Kennedy in 1963.
   Mayer, a lawyer who knew Jack Ruby, and Ruby's brother, Earl
Ruby, have been fighting nearly 24 years since Ruby died. This is
at least the fifth time Earl Ruby has gone to court in attempts to
unseat Mayer.
   Jack Ruby was convicted of murder in 1964 and sentenced to death
in the electric chair. An appeals court overturned the conviction
in 1966, but Ruby died in 1967 at age 55 before a new trial could
be held.
   Earl Ruby claims his brother, from his deathbed, told him that
Mayer had been instructed to tear up the will in which he had named
Mayer executor.
   Jack Ruby bought the revolver for $62.50 in a Dallas gun shop
and used it to shoot Oswald two days after Kennedy was
assassinated.
   Mayer has estimated the gun, which he keeps in a safe deposit
box, would bring $125,000 from a collector. Mitch Martin, a board
member of the JFK Assassination Information Center, put the amount
at no more than $50,000.
   Other than the gun, that estate includes only the clothing and
jewelry Ruby wore at the time he shot Oswald, some personal papers
and other clothing.
   Whatever the value of the gun, Mayer has contended that proceeds
from its sale must be used to pay Ruby's debts - among them,
$65,000 in expenses he claims he has incurred in handling the
estate and fighting Ruby's lawsuits.
   Earl Ruby, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., counters that Mayer is
trying to make money off the estate.
   The struggle over the estate isn't the only bizarre aspect of
Ruby's legacy.
   Last year, 22 years after Ruby died, the Internal Revenue
Service entered the case, contending that when Ruby died, he owed
$17,000 in back taxes. That amount, the IRS said, has now accrued
to $86,010 with interest and penalties.
   Earl Ruby contends the IRS sacrificed any claim by waiting so
long.

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Tokyo, Stocks Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices firmed.
   The dollar closed at 127.35 yen, down 1.15 yen from Friday's
128.50-yen finish. It opened at 127.45 yen, and stayed in a narrow
range between 127.25 yen and 127.65 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 25,329.31, up
323.67 points, or 1.29 percent, from Friday's close of 25,005.64.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds were
trading at 84.94 points, up from Friday's close of 84.25. Their
yield was 7.710 percent, down from 7.870 percent.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's slide partly to diplomatic
efforts reported in Paris, Baghdad and elsewhere seeking a peaceful
solution of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The diplomatic move toward resolving the gulf crisis boosted
the yen,'' said Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank. She was referring
to a meeting in Paris between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and French President Francois Mitterrand, and Soviet envoy Yevgeny
Primakov's visit to Baghdad.
   The yen firms whenever tension in the Middle East seems to ease
these days, Ms. Takeuchi said.
   Trading was cautious as the market waited for the release of
U.S. third-quarter gross national product figures on Tuesday and
U.S. employment figres on Friday, she added.
   On the stock market, traders said share prices firmed on the
strength of the higher yen and the firmer bond market.
   Gainers outnumbered losers 678 to 306, with 141 issues unchanged
on the first section. Volume on the first section was estimated at
500 million shares, little changed from 498.2 million on Friday.

   A non-communist coalition that wants
full political independence for Soviet Georgia appears to have won
the southern republic's legislative elections, an election official
said today.
   Sunday's was the first true multiparty vote in Soviet history.
   The Round Table-Free Georgia coalition appeared likely to win 60
percent to 70 percent of the vote, said David Dzhaparidze, a member
of the central election commission.
   The Round Table, led by Zviad Gamsakhurdia, won majorites in all
26 districts in the capital of Tbilisi, Dzhaparidze said.
   ``This is great,'' said Robert Petriarshvili, a spokesman for
the coalition. He said the vote would give Round Table 110 out of
the 250 seats in the Supreme Soviet.
   Dzhaparidze said the Communist Party appeared to be doing well
in areas where non-Georgian ethnic groups hold a majority, and it
was expected to win 20 percent to 25 percent of the legislative
seats. The remainder would be split among smaller parties, he said.
   Among the 15 Soviet republics, all but Kirgizia have declared
some form of sovereignty or independence. The three Baltic
republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were the first to make
the move, but they are still negotiating with Moscow.
   Gamsakhurdia, interviewed over the weekend, predicted that
Georgia's transition to political independence would take about two
years, and that the republic would maintain extensive economic
relations with the Soviet Union.
   It also seems likely that Georgia will rely on the Soviet Union
in national security matters, he said.
   About 35 parties, most grouped by coalition, took part in
Sunday's election.
   Non-communists have won election in several cities and republics
elsewhere in the Soviet Union, but Georgia's vote was the first in
which formal parties, created under new Soviet laws, were listed on
the ballot.
   Long lines snaked from polling sites in the capital, Tbilisi, as
well as the surrounding countryside. About 3 million people were
eligible to vote.
   Official results were not expected until the end of the week,
the official Tass news agency reported. Runoffs in close races are
set for Nov. 11.
   Maguli Latariya cast her ballot swathed head to foot in black
mourning clothes. Her 16-year-old daughter was one of 19 Georgians
killed on April 19, 1989, when Soviet troops broke up a peaceful
nationalist protest in Tbilisi.
   The killings strengthened independence aspirations. Even the
ruling Communist Party of Georgia was forced to advocate
independence from Moscow as part of its platform.
   Mrs. Latariya wept as she voted, saying it was ``as if my
daughter's voice was telling me what to do.'' She said she voted
for the Round Table coalition, a bloc of seven political parties.
   Under the election law, a party must get at least 4 percent of
the republicwide vote to gain representation in the legislature.
That provision was designed to encourage coalitions and large
parties, and to discourage splintering into small factions.
   Tass reported that the elections were observed by experts from
the United States, France, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Spain
and Finland.
   Many voters, interviewed as they left polling stations, said the
Communists had gained ground in recent months because they
represented stability.
   ``We would like life to be peaceful again,'' said Nari
Chanturia, complaining about the uncertainty and violence that have
gripped Georgia in recent months.
   Some politicians boycotted the election, claiming it was not
democratic. One of them, the leader of the National Democratic
Party, Gia Chanturia, was shot in the arm Saturday as he left a
political meeting.
   Chanturia and others formed a 200-seat National Congress of
Georgia to act as a shadow parliament and push for independence.
   Two members of the National Democratic Party, Gia Kobakhedze and
Irakli Tsereteli, spoke on Georgian television and accused
Gamsakhurdia, the Round Table head, of organizing the shooting of
Chanturia on orders from Soviet authorities.
   Gamsakhurdia denied the charges.

   Aggressive squirrels have driven humans from
of a playground.
   In the past two weeks, two squirrels have bitten children at
Montgomery County's Wheaton Regional Park. On Thursday, a man
bludgeoned a squirrel with a stick because it was annoying him,
said park maintenance worker Kathy Lowe.
   Park police have closed the playground until further notice.
Visitors to the playground were greeted Saturday with the yellow
tape used at crime scenes, and a sign that read: ``Playground
closed due to over aggressive squirrels.''
   ``The squirrels are just acting squirrelly now,'' said Lowe.
``They are so busy burying acorns they are aggravated at the
people.''
   A bumper crop of acorns over the past two years has produced a
bumper crop of gray squirrels, who are gathering food with
particular fervor, Lowe said.
   When park patrons offer food, as was the case with the children
who were bitten, the animals move in close and don't take no for an
answer, Lowe said.
   The children were not seriously hurt, but park recommended they
see a doctor to determine whether they should undergo treatment for
rabies.

   A 15-year-old staging a gallows scene at a
Halloween party accidentally hanged himself when the noose somehow
tightened, authorities said.
   William Anthony Odom of Charlotte, N.C., was pronounced dead
Friday night amid fake spider webs and plastic bats decorating an
aunt's home. Odom and several of his friends had staged a haunted
house in the basement.
   A week ago, a 17-year-old died while staging a similar Halloween
hangman gag along the route of a hayride in Lakewood, N.J.
   Odom had crouched inside a wooden cupboard, said his grandmother
Hattie Carpenter. He was dressed as a pirate, wearing black
trousers, a red shirt and a gold earring. Around his neck was a
3-foot length of nylon rope.
   ``It was a slip-knot-type noose; the more pressure you apply,
the tighter it gets,'' Coroner Jim Chapman said. ``Evidently, it
was tight enough to cause some problems with his breathing, and he
either passed out or panicked.''
   Chapman said he's unsure how the rope tightened. Odom could have
slipped and lost his balance or was playing with the knot, causing
it to tighten, Chapman said.
   The coroner said it's also possible that the knot gradually
tightened and reduced blood to the brain, causing him to faint and
then suffocate.
   ``What was really sad was that the kids thought we were going to
be able to revive him, but it was too late. They were scared when
we got there, but then they became hysterical,'' Chapman said.

   Allegations that Jon Grunseth cheated on his
wives and swam nude with teen-age girls combined to drive him from
the governor's race and plunge the Republican Party into turmoil
nine days before the election.
   Citing ``enormous pressure'' on his family, the political
process and the state, the 44-year-old business executive called it
quits late Sunday and apologized to supporters and contributors.
   ``I always haven't been a perfect person. I think I'm a pretty
decent guy, but I've made some mistakes and I feel badly about
that, too,'' Grunseth said at his home about 20 miles east of
Minneapolis.
   Grunseth was accused of having an affair during both of his
marriages and of skinny dipping with teen-age girls in 1981. He
denied the nude-swimming allegations and said the affair ended
before his second marriage in 1984.
   Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich is seeking an unprecedented fourth
term. He had no immediate comment.
   Republican state auditor Arne Carlson, who placed second in the
Sept. 11 GOP primary, launched a write-in campaign a week ago as
pressure mounted on Grunseth to drop out.
   His name will go on the Nov. 6 ballot if the party fails to name
someone else by Friday afternoon.
   ``There's no question he (Carlson) is in the best position, but
right at this moment, I'm not saying I'm supporting Arne Carlson,''
said state GOP Chairman Bob Weinholzer. ``If someone else can show
me how they can put a campaign together in one week and win, I'd be
receptive to take a look at it.''
   Carlson, a moderate who supports abortion rights, is
unacceptable to the religious, conservative faction that controls
the state party.
   ``I'm going to spend a lot of time now to make sure we heal the
wounds,'' he said. ``I have to reach to all areas of the Republican
Party to bring this together so we can put together a winning
election.''
   Republicans had begun the year with high hopes of unseating
Perpich, who had been derided as eccentric and put on the defensive
about living too grand a style, with a luxury car and bodyguard.
   In the most recent independent poll, conducted Oct. 19-21,
Carlson was favored over Perpich 51 percent to 41 percent. The
statewide Star Tribune-KSTP Minnesota Poll of 601 likely voters had
a margin of error of four points.
   Grunseth's campaign was crippled Oct. 15 after two women made
sworn statements alleging Grunseth tried to get them to swim naked
with him during a 1981 pool party at his home.
   The women, who were 13 and 14 at the time, said they refused but
that Grunseth, his teen-age daughter and a 16-year-old girl took
off their bathing suits. One of the women claimed Grunseth tried to
pull down her bathing suit.
   On Sunday, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported that
32-year-old Tamara Taylor of Minnetonka claimed to have had a
sexual relationship with Grunseth on and off from 1980 to 1989.
Grunseth divorced Katharine Winston in 1983 and married his second
wife, Vicki, in 1984.
   Grunseth acknowledged having a romantic relationship with Taylor
but said it ended ``a long time ago - in the early '80s.''
   Taylor said she spoke out to prevent Grunseth's ``further
deception of the voters ... in regard to his past antics, his
character, and what ruthless actions he is willing to take in order
to be elected governor.''
   Grunseth said Sunday he had been on the verge of quitting the
race for two weeks.
   ``It's wear and tear, it's just simply pure wear and tear,'' he
said. ``The whole thing becomes sickening. It's exhaustion, is what
it is. Mental, physical, emotional exhaustion. ... At a point
there's an end. You just say, `Man, it's more than I can bear.' ''
   Mrs. Grunseth said she believes her husband's contention that he
ended the affair before they married. She said she did not try to
dissuade him from dropping out of the race.
   The accusations, she said, prove ``there's no floor in the
decency scale anymore about what people will write or say.''

   The rich and famous flock to the Hotel
del Coronado for its lavish service, beautiful view and world-class
reputation. Alan May seeks less earthly delights.
   He's looking for a ghost.
   On Halloween, he's got plenty of company.
   The employees and many guests at the Victorian seaside resort
know all about the black-clad ghost that haunts room 3312. Some -
including May - claim to have seen it.
   ``Anytime Halloween comes around, the phones just won't stop
ringing off the hook and people come in looking for the ghost,''
said hotel spokeswoman Nancy Weisinger. ``It's almost like this
lady is doing her own publicity.''
   Steve Miller, the hotel's front desk manager, said many guests
who stayed in the room ``felt like there were eyes looking at them
all the time.''
   Although more than one tale circulates, the most famous involves
Kate Morgan, a 24-year-old pregnant woman who checked into the
hotel on Thanksgiving Day 1892 under the name of Lottie Bernard,
had an abortion and, according to a coroner's report at the time,
committed suicide on the steps leading to the beach.
   May, a 48-year-old defense attorney from San Francisco, has
written a book that gives the legend a different twist. He says
Morgan was murdered by her estranged husband.
   May, who has stayed in room 3312 more than a dozen times, has
claimed to have encountered the ghost twice. He said she stared at
him from a TV set, brushed against his cheek and appears in his
dreams.
   ``I think she just wanted her story told,'' he said.
   This is his version:
   Tom Morgan married Kate Farmer in 1885 in Hamburg, Iowa, after
winning her from her father in a poker game. The couple traveled
throughout the country, using numerous aliases.
   The marriage was stormy, especially when Kate became pregnant,
and they separated often.
   Wearing a black lace dress and shawl, Kate checked into the
Hotel del Coronado in 1892. She induced an abortion and waited in
vain for Morgan, who had promised to meet her there.
   Four days later, she bought a gun and searched for him at other
hotels. The next morning, she was found dead.
   May claims Tom Morgan shot Kate as she slept, destroyed some
letters that would have implicated him and dumped the gun and body
outside to make it look like suicide.

   Minority Gagauz militants in the Moldavian
republic have set up cordons to prevent Soviet troops from entering
their region and enforcing state-of-emergency measures, Tass
reported today.
   The Moldavian parliament imposed the state of emergency and
Soviet troops were standing by, ready to move in under the command
of Gen. Yuri Shatalin if lawmakers issue the order, the official
news agency said.
   A provisional parliamentary committee was monitoring the
standoff from Chimishlia, a small town in southern Moldavia
bordering on the Gagauz territory, which was declared a
state-of-emergency zone on Friday.
   ``Although there were no clashes between Moldavian and Gagauz
volunteers, representatives of Gagauzes set up cordons to prevent
the (Soviet troops and republic militiamen) from entering,'' Tass
said.
   The Gagauz are a close-knit group of about 150,000 people, all
descendants of Christians who fled to Moldavia from Turkey because
of religious persecution about 160 years ago.
   Worried by rising Moldavian nationalism and angry over a law
that made Moldavian the republic's official language, the Gagauz
claimed the southern corner of the republic last week and began
holding elections for an autonomous government.
   Brigades of Moldavian volunteers, said by various sources to
number between 12,000 and 50,000, streamed into the area to try to
stop the independence movement.
   Gagauz youths in turn formed defensive units, aided by some
ethnic Russians, who also oppose Moldavian nationalism.
   Negotiators for both sides were trying to defuse the crisis.
   Soviet officials holding negotiations with representatives of
the Gagauz provisional committee in the southern city of Komrat
called for the withdrawal of militant Gagauz volunteers from the
emergency zone, Tass said.
   ``If this condition is complied with, Moldavian volunteer
detachments will be withdrawn from areas adjacent the
state-of-emergency zone,'' the news agency said.
   On Sunday night, the chairman of the executive council of the
disputed Komrat region appealed in a television broadcast for
peace.
   ``The inter-ethnic conflict in the republic has reached the
point beyond which there will be bloodshed and the deaths of
innocent people,'' he said.
   According to Tass, the two sides have agreed to set up a joint
commission for the mutual inspection of the volunteer units in
preparation for their withdrawal.

   A Japanese medical team sent to the Persian Gulf
amid intense debate over Japan's role there has found its services
aren't needed by U.S.-led multinational forces, members said today.
   Instead, the medical team could be useful in helping refugees in
the region, according to a recent assessment given to the
government by a 17-member advance team sent to the gulf region in
mid-September.
   ``U.S.-led forces have their own medical services and will treat
their own soldiers,'' Dr. Shigemi Teramoto, head of the team, said
in an interview.
   Teramoto said the Japanese team, originally set to be expanded
to 100 members, will be stationed 210 miles from the Kuwaiti border
and consult with the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health on how it can
serve.
   Sending a medical corps to assist the multinational forces
arrayed against Iraq in the region is part of the
government-sponsored U.N. Peace Cooperation bill now being debated
in Parliament.
   The bill, which calls for the deployment of Self-Defense Forces
abroad, has encountered widespread opposition because of Japan's
constitutional ban on using force overseas. Its passage is in
doubt, lawmakers have said.
   A member of the advance medical team said U.S. and Saudi
hospitals were so well staffed and equipped that Japan's
contribution ``might just result in confusing the already
established medical system of the forces,'' the newspaper Asahi
Shimbun reported.

<HEAD>Forecaster: Organic Coffee In, Home Videos Out for 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organic coffee and ``retro-chic'' appliances will
be big hits in 1991, but the popularity of New Age religions and
baseball doubleheaders will fade, ``The American Forecaster 1991''
predicts.
   Other anticipated hits are ``success surgery'' for executives,
field trips for kids and ``gourmet'' ice. Home videos and the
Southwestern interior design style will bomb.
   Kim Long, 41, of Denver, began compiling the book on what's in
and what's out in 1983. It sells about 10,000 copies a year.
   Organic coffee, grown without pesticides, ``has all the makings
of a major food fad,'' Long said.
   ``People are becoming a lot more literate about what they put
into their mouths,'' he said. ``They're willing to spend more money
for the details.''
   He predicts that the boxy appliances that marked the dawn of the
post-World War II era will reappear next year. ``It's the visual
appeal, so solid and heavy - the beginning of the atomic era,'' he
said.
   Long says more executives will have cosmetic surgery and workers
will eat at their desks so they can be more productive, signs of
Americans' intensified interest in their work.
   The ideal look will be ``relatively small noses, not a prominent
chin, but a chinless look is unacceptable, and wrinkles would be
out,'' he said.
   However, 1991 will not be the year for workaholics.
   ``I think the '90s is going to be a fun decade,'' said Long.
``Most people in the big `baby boom' age group will be in their 40s
and 50s. They will have earned a living and raised families. I
think that equates to a potential situation where people will look
to do fun things, to worry less about what the neighbors think or
families think.''
   A trend that has hit Japan and is expected in the United States
is the popularity of ``gourmet'' ice. The ice, reportedly up to
10,000 years old, is chipped from Alaskan ice floes and valued for
its purity.
   Next year will bring a reduced interest in New Age religions:
``It won't die. But my observation is that it will just be less
faddish.''
   Long predicts a revival of interest in millenialism as the year
2000 approaches, generating a fascination with ``crackpot
religions.''
   Interest in home videos, a fad that soared this year with the
success of television's ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' will
also wane, Long said.
   The Santa Fe fashion look, including laughing coyotes and cactus
cutouts, has been overmarketed and will no longer be hip, the
Forecaster says.
   Long, a newspaper columnist, said he researches trends by
reading numerous newspapers and magazines, keeping files on
particular topics, and monitors computer data bases.

<HEAD>Norwegian Government Resigns Over Trade Dispute</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with new details, resignation formally
submitted, number of seats in Parliament. No pickup.
^By DOUG MELLGREN</NOTE>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's year-old coalition government
resigned today after the uneasy center-right alliance split over
how much Norway should open itself to trade with the European
Economic Community.
   Conservative Prime Minister Jan P. Syse told Parliament that his
government could not agree on the country's position in talks
between the EEC and the six-nation European Free Trade Association,
of which Norway is a member.
   The talks are to center on the creation of a joint economic
region.
   Syse had worked through the weekend, seeking common ground that
would allow his coalition of the Conservative, Center and Christian
Democratic parties to remain in power.
   But the anti-trade bloc Center Party, with strong support from
the country's subsidized farmers, rejected the idea of sweeping
changings in Norwegian laws that protect domestic industry and
resources.
   During talks on the creation of the joint economic region, the
European Community has pressed for changes in the Norwegian laws.
The EEC claims the laws discriminate against foreigners.
   The Center Party, the governing coalition's smallest member,
wants continued border controls and some protection of domestic
argriculture, fishing grounds and other resources.
   Syse's government will remain in office until a new government
is formed, which could take several days.
   Norway's parliament was divided into nearly equal blocs of
socialist and non-socialist blocs after Sept. 11, 1989 national
elections, and news reports have said that the near deadlock has
made both sides reluctant to govern.
   Anders Talleraas, the Conservative's parliamentary leader, said
the party has enouraged Syse to form a new single party government
because of the small non-socialist majority.
   ``I am prepared to form a new government,'' Syse said before
delivering his government's formal resignation to Crown Prince
Harald. Norway's figurehead monarch, King Olav V, is recovering
from a stroke.
   Syse would need backing from all four non-socialist parties.
   Without it, he will likely ask former Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland to form her third Labor Party government since 1981.
   Her left-leaning party is the country's largest. In addition to
socialist allies, it would need backing from the Center Party to
form a government.
   ``It is still not clear how the new government will be made
up,'' Brundtland said in a television interview. She said Labor is
``in a clear observer role, waiting to see what happens.''
   When the coalition agreed on a joint platform and toppled
Brundtland last year, the sensitive European Economic Community
issue was left vague.
   The pro-EEC Conservatives had said they would not allow discord
within the coalition to hamper talks.
   The conflict may have been aggravated last week when neighboring
Sweden strongly hinted that it would seek EEC membership, prompting
calls in Norway for both countries to join the community.
   Anne Enger Lahnstein of the Center Party said the issue was no
longer the joint economic region negotiations, but a battle over
EEC membership.
   News reports speculate that a purely Conservative government
would probably be short-lived. The next government will be the
Norway's sixth since 1980.
   Leaders have expressed fears the country could suffer frequent
government changes, due to the nearly deadlocked Parliament and no
provision for calling new elections.
   Public disenchantment has increased due to tough austerity
programs, intended to pull Norway's oil dependent economy out of a
four-year slump that has brought record unemployment.
   Labor controls 81 seats in the 165-seat Parliament, including 63
of its own, 17 from the Socialist Left and one independent.
   The Conservatives have 37 seats, the Christian Democrats' 14 and
the Center's 11.
   For a majority, the non-socialists would have to depend on the
the right-wing Party of Progress, which soared from two to 22 seats
in the last national election.
   The Center Party was reportedly more willing to support a new
socialist government than allow the Progressives, which was viewed
as too extremist to be invited into the Conservative-led coalition.

<TEXT>
   Bored policemen shoo monkeys and glance
sleepily at closed-circuit television cameras as they enforce a
curfew in this town whose name has become a battle cry in India's
latest political and religious crisis.
   About 100 people have been killed throughout India in the past
week in riots caused by Hindu plans to build a temple on a dusty
hilltop where a Moslem mosque now stands.
   The latest death was reported today in Lucknow, capital of Uttar
Pradesh state 75 miles west of Ayodhya. Police officials said Hindu
crowds surged through a Moslem neighborhood throwing bricks.
   The religious feud has precipitated a political crisis that has
brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government to the brink of
collapse.
   But the firestorm raging elsewhere in the country is masked by
inactivity and tight security in Ayodhya, where Hindu
fundamentalists vow they will get through roadblocks and start
building their temple to the god Rama on Tuesday.
   The fundamentalists said today in a handwritten communique that
thousands of followers were hiding near Ayodhya and were ready to
start building.
   ``Communal tension will flare up all over the country, but an
Ayodhya resident will not let a drop of blood be spilled because
then Rama's name will be sullied,'' said Mudit Sharma, who works
for a Hindu charity near the disputed site.
   ``Moslems of the area are not any diferent from Hindus,''
Sharma said. ``They participate in our festivals. We go to their
house during Islamic festivals. All these fights are because of
political loafers.''
   The fundamentalist cause has been espoused by the Hindu
right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party. Its top leaders are among the
more about 80,000 people arrested in the last week while trying to
march to Ayodhya, 300 miles east of New Delhi.
   The arrests prompted the party to withdraw its support for
Singh's coalition government, leaving him without the parliamentary
majority needed to stay in office.
   Singh, who plans to face Parliament for a vote of confidence on
Nov. 7, wants the temple-mosque dispute settled in court.
   The fundamentalists claim the mosque stands atop the very spot
where Lord Rama was born and therefore is a religious matter, not a
legal one. Moslems, a minority in officially secular but
predominantly Hindu India, fear the displacement of one mosque
could jeopardize hundreds of other Islamic sites across the
country.
   The mosque, called the Babri Masjid, was constructed in the 16th
century when Mogul armies conquered northern India. Hindu
fundamentalists claimed the Moslem conquerors destroyed a Rama
temple on the spot where the mosque now stands.
   The Hindu World Council, backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party,
has organized the campaign to build the temple by either moving or
demolishing the little mosque.
   On Friday, the government of Uttar Pradesh state imposed an
around-the-clock curfew in Ayodhya to keep temple advocates from
reaching the disputed hilltop. Trains to the area were halted and
roads blocked by police and paramilitary troops.
   ``They have made Ayodhya into a cantonment for political gains.
Let them arrest us, but thousands of devotees will come to Ayodhya
tomorrow,'' said Tara Kant Jha, secretary of the World Hindu
Council's local office in Ayodhya.
   The council and the Bharatiya Janata Party claim the
government's tough stand on Ayodhya is only a bid to win Moslem
votes.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people, of
whom 82 percent are Hindu. In Uttar Pradesh state, where the
government is allied with Singh, Moslems account for about 30
percent of the 120 million people.
   Hindu-Moslem clashes occur periodically in other parts of Uttar
Pradesh, but no one can remember trouble around Ayodhya or its twin
town of Faizabad, three miles down the road. About a quarter of the
area's population is Moslem.
   ``There never has been any communal tension in Faizabad or
Ayodhya. And I don't think there will be after Oct. 30,'' the date
deemed auspicious by Hindu astrologers to start building the Rama
temple, said District Commissioner Madhukar Gupta, the top civil
administrator of the area.
   Most residents agree. They seem unconcerned about the curfew,
but business is suffering.
   Ayodhya is a major Hindu pilgrimage site. There are about 6,000
temples in the town of 45,000 people on the banks of the River
Saryu.
   Most people live on the business generated by tens of thousands
of Hindu pilgrims who arrive every year in October for a Hindu
festival.
   About 20,000 security troops deployed around Ayodhya have
prevented pilgrims from entering Ayodhya this week, fearing Hindu
activists may infiltrate the town.
   Elaborate security arrangements include closed-circuit
television cameras and iron gates every 20 yards on the lane
leading to the disputed hilltop.

   Tens of thousands of revelers
celebrated Halloween early with a weekend of partying that left two
people injured. More than 300 people were arrested, authorities
said.
   Up to 20,000 partiers, some dressed in costumes, brought traffic
to a standstill in this normally quiet beach town near the
University of California at Santa Barbara campus Saturday night as
they walked from one house party to another, Sheriff's Lt. Ken
Shemwell said Sunday.
   Sheriff's deputies arrested 111 people Friday night and about
200 Saturday night, mostly for alcohol violations, he said. Of that
total, 69 were booked into the county jail, he said.
   One young man was seriously injured when he fell 40 feet off a
cliff, Shemwell said. Another man suffered head injuries while slam
dancing, during which dancers hurl themselves at each other.
   Shemwell said officers expected another large crowd Wednesday
night.
   ``We expect to have our hands full,'' he said. ``But we've been
doing this for years. We'll be ready.''
   Last year, more than 30,000 people roamed the streets and there
were 600 arrests on Halloween.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Anti-Noise Plan, New Passenger Fees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airlines would be required to retire their
noisiest jetliners by the end of the decade under legislation
passed by Congress just before it adjourned for the year.
   Under another provision of the legislation, airline passengers
could pay as much as $12 more for a roundtrip ticket.
   Both requirements were part of a budget package that was
lawmakers' last major act Sunday before leaving Washington.
   The legislation requires that airlines replace about 2,350 noisy
aircraft, or about half of the nation's commercial jetliner fleet,
with quieter jetliners by the year 2000. In some cases, planes may
be equipped with ``hush kits'' that reduce engine noise to comply
with the new requirements.
   The Transportation Department estimated that as many as 3
million people are subject to significant airport noise levels near
the nation's airports. In some cases, the number of people exposed
to such noise could drop 80 percent to 90 percent, the department
said.
   Airport officials have long sought the authority to impose
passenger fees, saying they need the money for expansion projects
and for noise-reduction programs that include soundproofing nearby
schools and other buildings.
   The passenger departure fee of up to $3 at an airport could
generate more than $1 billion annually. On a connecting flight, the
fees could mean as much as $12 added to the roundtrip cost. The tax
comes along with an increase in the ticket tax from 8 percent to 10
percent.

   The Soviet media have shelved their previous
unswerving support for Cuba and are becoming downright irreverent
in discussing the island's policies, its Marxist system and even
Fidel Castro himself.
   Although relations remain cordial at the official level, newly
liberated Soviet reporters are feeling no compunction about saying
what they think.
   The latest and perhaps most notorious example touched on an area
that has been sacrosanct for 30 years - Castro's personal life.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, a new wave, glasnost-era daily, said
recently that Castro has 32 houses, a personal security contingent
of 9,700 and five children by his ``present wife.'' So far as the
Cuban public knows, there has been no change in Castro's marital
status since he was divorced 35 years ago. Such subjects are taboo
in Cuba, and during the heyday of Soviet-Cuban relations, the
Moscow press was respectful of Cuban sensitivities on the subject.
But no longer.
   Other examples of Soviet media deviationism:
   -Disputing Cuban claims of a 2-million-ton shortfall this year
in Soviet oil deliveries to Cuba, Komsomoskaya Pravda said in
September the deficit was only 580,000 tons. The Cuban daily Granma
called the allegation ``lies.'' Cuba has cited the fuel deficit in
justifying severe austerity measures imposed in recent months.
   -A letter published in the same Soviet publication also
criticized the treatment given 250 Soviet children who were sent to
Cuba after becoming ill from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.
No special medical treatment was offered to the children, some of
whom had to be hospitalized from the tropical heat. The rest
``languished'' in their ``army-style huts,'' it said.
   -Izvestia, implying criticism of both Moscow and Havana, has
complained that Soviet aid often is used inefficiently. ``The large
volume of unfinished construction projects, the enormous heap of
uninstalled equipment (which becomes obsolete even before it is
placed in operation), the obsession with gargantuan projects that
ignore the island's size and needs - all this has existed and
continues to exist,'' it said.
   -Izvestia also published a letter from a Tashkent man who said
of Cuba: ``Pluralism is needed. Socialism has led to people's not
giving a damn about anything, not even about trouble knocking on
the door.''
   -The Cuban economy, says the Soviet magazine Literaturnaya
Gazeta, resembles ``someone crippled from childhood who is doomed
to move about using the crutches of foreign aid.''
   -The Moscow News had kind words for the Cuban exile community in
Miami, who are perhaps the most outspoken critics of the Cuban
system. Although portrayed by Cuban authorities as criminals,
bandits and paid agents of imperialism, a Moscow News correspondent
who visited Miami found the exiles to be people ``with a taste for
enterprise, the creative and technical intelligentsia.''
   Gillian Gunn, a Cuba expert at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said there seems to be competition now among
Soviet journalists to see ``who can out-glasnost the other.''
   She said there is an element of genuine criticism of the
situation in Cuba and also an element of rebellion against the
ideologically based reporting of the pre-glasnost years.
   Cuba considered Moscow News and another Soviet publication,
Sputnik, to be so distasteful that both were banned from the island
last year. ``They publish formulas that favor anarchy,'' the
Communist Party daily Granma said.
   The Soviet media criticism of Cuba reflects increasing doubt
among many Soviets about the propriety of continuing aid to Cuba -
$5 billion annually, according to U.S. estimates - at a time of
growing economic deprivation at home.

   Prime Minister Jim Bolger's
National Party swept to power by promising to cut unemployment in
half, keep inflation under 2 percent, balance the budget and spur
the economy.
   But the new conservative prime minister is already seeking to
diminish the expectations he raised during the campaign that led to
his party's election Saturday. Bolger now says New Zealand voters
should be happy if he fulfills three out of four of those campaign
promises.
   That still remains a tall order for Bolger who also hopes to
patch up ties with Washington after six years of Labor Party
government.
   Bolger was swept to power in the biggest election rout in New
Zealand's 50 years of two-party government, but analysts said the
size of the victory could hurt the traditionally divisive National
Party.
   The National Party expects 68 of Parliament's 97 seats, with
Labor falling to 28 seats and the New Labor Party holding the
remaining seat.
   Former Labor Prime Minister David Lange said the National Party
will find it difficult to achieve party consensus with such a broad
base of support.
   ``You cannot satisfy the bulk of people with offers ... and this
is a party with considerable inner divisions,'' Lange said.
   Critics said the National Party vote came mostly from people
disenchanted with Labor and the nation's difficult economic
problems.
   Unemployment, at 7.9 percent, is at its highest level since
World War II. The budget deficit is projected at up to $1.8 billion
in the next fiscal year.
   Party pledges to cut unemployment in half, keep inflation under
2 percent, balance the budget and spur a growth rate of 3 percent
per year appear daunting. He also says he would like some
reconciliation with Washington, which would appear to be a major
diplomatic task.
   Nine months ago, the National Party reversed itself and said it
would maintain Labor's 1984 ``no nuclear'' policy of refusing to
allow port calls by U.S. warships because they would not say
whether they were carrying nuclear weapons.
   In response to the policy, the United States in 1986 cut
high-level contacts with New Zealand and dropped the country from
the ANZUS military alliance, which also includes Australia.
   Bolger, 55, earned a reputation as a tough negotiator while
serving as labor minister for six years until 1984, when Labor
handed the National Party a devastating election loss. He took over
the party's reins in 1986 and led it to a narrow loss in 1987.
   Bolger is the son of Irish immigrants. Like the man he succeeds,
Mike Moore, he left school at 15 to work the family's North Island
dairy farm.
   A devout Roman Catholic, he and his wife, Joan, have nine
children. He has consistently opposed women's access to abortion.

<HEAD>Congress Sends Bush Overhaul of Nation's Immigration Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is expected to sign an overhaul
of the nation's immigration laws that will substantially boost the
number of immigrants allowed into the United States each year,
especially those with special job skills.
   The first major rewrite of immigration law in a quarter-century
was approved by Congress late Saturday as it rushed to adjournment.
White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the legislation had the
president's support.
   The bill would boost the current limit of 490,000 a year on
legal immigrants to 645,000 in each fiscal year through 1994, and
675,000 thereafter. The measure keeps reuniting families as its
primary test, but also would open the door to foreigners with
special skills, those who are wealthy and even some shunned for
years for political or medical reasons, such as AIDS.
   The measure assigns the first 465,000 visas each year to the
``family preference'' category, with an estimated 220,000 of those
going to immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. At the same time, it
earmarks 40,000 visas for individuals from Italy, Poland, Ireland
and other traditional immigrant sources who have been virtually
shut out for the past 20 years.
   It also would remove bans on immigration for persons because of
homosexuality.
   In that period, U.S. immigration priority has been extended to
those from Asia and Latin America, with few coming from Europe,
Africa or other regions.
   The bill also would relax political restrictions dating to the
1950s, when Sen. Joe McCarthy, R-Wis., fought to ban many
categories of immigrants as part of his crusade against communism.
The secretary of state still will be able to bar individuals for
political reasons, however.
   The government also would be allowed to remove AIDS and other
diseases from the medical list for which a person may be denied
entry. Any decision on whether to do so is up to the Bush
administration.

<HEAD>Rich But Beleaguered: German Communists to Disclose Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a desperate effort to recoup from a big money
scandal, the former East German Communist Party says it will
disclose details of its assets and turn some over to a national
trustee.
   Party leader Gregor Gysi told a news conference in Bonn today
that the party has about $1.3 billion in assets.
   The party, now named the Party of Democratic Socialism, may be
the richest in Europe, but its political punch has plummeted since
it lost total control in East Germany a year ago and tested itself
in free elections.
   Two party members were arrested Friday for allegedly funneling
$72 million in party funds to an account in Moscow. Party leaders
declared over the weekend that they would submit their assets to an
independent review and relinquish all but what was needed to
satisfy obligations and continue political activities.
   Its leaders concede the scandal is a serious crisis for the
party as it approaches German elections Dec. 2, the first national
vote since East and West Germany united on Oct. 3.
   Party directors affirmed their support for Gysi, a 41-year-old
lawyer and Communist reformer who took over after the hard-line
bosses were ousted by a peaceful democratic revolt.
   But Gysi was deeply embarrassed by the huge amount of money
involved, and by the fact that he went to Moscow to look into the
matter after police raided his party headquarters in Berlin on Oct.
19 looking for evidence that led to Friday's arrests.
   Gysi was quoted today as telling the mass-circulation Bild
Zeitung that if he had known about the manipulation behind the
money transfer, he would not have flown to Moscow and ``made myself
look like an ape for a week.''
   Other politicians derided the former Communist Party, saying it
had shown itself to be corrupt and a mere continuation of the old
hard-liners.
   There is widespread belief that Communist figures salted away
huge amounts of property and other assets in the waning days of
their rule in East Germany.
   Gysi told a campaign rally Sunday in Alexanderplatz, the main
square in East Berlin, that there had to be a radical departure
from the party's past.
   A party statement admitted ``political mistakes'' and promised a
wide debate on the party's future.
   Gysi had offered earlier to resign as leader but decided against
it on the ground it would only damage the standing of the left in
German politics.
   German news commentators questioned whether the party would ever
reform.
   ``By remaining in his post, the talented politician Gysi just
makes himself unworthy of belief,'' the conservative Frankfurter
Allgemeine said in a front-page commentary.
   Die Welt, another conservative daily, said the fragments that
have come to light ``smell strongly like organized criminality.''
   Gysi told reporters today in Bonn, where he is a member of the
German parliament, that the legislature needs a leftist opposition.
   In March, when East Germany held its first free elections, the
former Communists finished third.
   After the two Germanys united, the renamed and supposedly
reformed party won a number of seats in the Oct. 14 elections for
state governments in the former East Germany.
   The state election results gave the party hope to win at least
slender representation in parliament in the Dec. 2 election, but
the money scandal will make their campaign more difficult.
   The former communists apparently are getting no help from their
comrades in Moscow. German authorities praised Soviet police for
their cooperation in looking into the Moscow end of the money
transfer.

<HEAD>Moderate Nationalists Finish First in Basque Region</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VITORIA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party was
the top finisher in regional elections, according to results
announced today. The outcome was seen as a rejection of a radical
independence movement.
   The Basque Nationalists won 22 seats in the 75-member regional
parliament. The Socialists, their governing partners for the past
four years, won 16 seats.
   Between them, the two parties have 38 seats, enough for a
one-seat majority. Previously, the Socialists had the larger bloc
of seats in the coalition.
   The Herri Batasuna or Popular Union party, widely considered the
political arm of the Basque nationalist terrorist group ETA,
finished with 13 seats, the same number it had already held.
   Several Basque newspaper editorials called the results a vote of
confidence for the current coalition government and an endorsement
of the strategy of seeking greater autonomy but not independence
from Madrid.
   There were no reports of political violence during Sunday's
voting in the northern three-province region. All the parties
except Herri Batasuna formally renounced violence in 1987.
   During the campaign, the Basque Nationalists and Socialists both
stressed political stability and economic recovery over the
autonomy issue.
   In Sunday's voting, the Basque Nationalists gained five seats
over their share from the last regional elections in 1986, while
the Socialists lost three seats.
   In other results, the conservative Popular Party, the chief
opposition party in the national parliament, won six seats, gaining
four. The conservative Union Alavesa, formed recently from
nationalists within the Popular Party, won three seats.
   The biggest losers were two leftist nationalist parties. Eusko
Alkartasuna lost four seats to finish with nine, and Euskadiko
Ezkerra's share dropped from nine to six seats.
   The Madrid-based Democratic and Social Center party, led by
former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez, virtually disappeared from the
political map. The party, which won two seats in the 1986 election,
garnered less than 1 percent of the vote and failed to win a single
seat.
   Officials said 61 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters
cast ballots.

   A gunman opened fire in a crowded church
basement, wounding seven of the 300 people gathered for a social
event.
   Police Constable Bruno Vaillancourt said three women and four
men were shot early Sunday, but that none was critically injured.
The shootings occurred at St. Pascal Baylon Roman Catholic Church.
   Police did not identify the gunman or the victims.
   Constable Charles Morrisseau said the investigation is
proceeding slowly because many witnesses will not talk to the
police. ``Nobody wants to say anything,'' he said.
   Vaillancourt said three people already had been taken to the
hospital by the time police arrived at the church shortly after
1:30 a.m. Sunday. The most seriously injured person suffered a
bullet wound behind the ear. The others were wounded in the
abdomen, hands and feet.
   While the police said they did not know the reason for the
shootings, the church pastor suggested rival gangs might be
involved.
   The Rev. Louis Levasseur said fighting among rival black groups
has been a problem for the eight years he has been at the church.
The elderly priest also said the problems only occur when
English-speaking black groups rent the hall for special events.
   ``We rent the hall to Latin-Americans, Asians and Haitians and
never have any problems,'' Levasseur said.
   The race and language of the group that rented the hall at the
time of the shootings were not immediately reported.
   ``This is not the first time there have been gunshots and people
hurt,'' said Levasseur. Shots were fired in the hall five or six
months ago, but no one has been injured in about a year and a half,
he said.
   He suggested the church may have to stop renting the hall to
English-speaking black groups ``at the risk of being labeled
racist. ''

   About 600,000 Southwestern Bell Telephone customers will change
to the 903 area code, the eighth new area code for Texas. Dallas
and nearby cities will remain 214.
   There are about 7.9 million possible seven-digit phone numbers
within each area code, said Southwestern Bell spokesman Jim
Patillo. Without the change, population growth in the current 214
area would have used up all available numbers by the end of 1991,
he said.
   The greatest impact will be to customers living in Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Arkansas along the northeast Texas line. Those
residents frequently call businesses and residences in north Texas,
Patillo said.
   The change will not affect rates, Patillo said, although long

charges.
   California has the most area codes with 10, followed by Texas
and New York with eight.

   A group of 22 South Koreans filed suit in Tokyo
District Court today, demanding a public apology and compensation
from the Japanese government for victims of World War II, the court
said.
   The Koreans said they or their family members had been drafted
by Japan and forced to work as laborers or soldiers during the war.
   Tens of thousands of Koreans were drafted into Japanese service
while Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945.
Japan has recently expressed regrets for some of its actions during
the colonial era.
   A court official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
group did not specify the amount of compensation sought. He did not
say when the court would start hearing the case.
   A Foreign Ministry official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Japan's position is that all questions of
compensation were resolved by agreements between Japan and South
Korea in 1965.
   The mass-circulation newspaper Asahi Shimbun quoted the Korean
plaintiffs as saying the fates of many Koreans drafted into the
Japanese army remain unknown, and they want an investigation.
   ``Whatever talks were held at the governmental level, a real
settlement could not be made without the people concerned,'' the
Koreans were quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Court to Hear Black Lung Benefits Disputes from Pennsylvania, West
Virginia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to resolve a
dispute over black lung benefits that may affect $650 million in
claims by coal miners and their families.
   The court said it will decide how difficult it should be for
mining companies to challenge claims by as many as 3,500 miners.
   The court was asked to settle conflicting rulings from federal
appeals courts that have studied the issue in cases from
Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   The Bush administration sided with the coal companies in seeking
to limit the ability of some workers and their families to receive
benefits.
   Justice Department lawyers said coal mine operators should be
allowed to show that disabled or deceased miners did not suffer
from black lung disease, or that work in the mines did not cause
their disability.
   The government also noted that black lung benefits may exceed
$185,000 per miner or family.
   The disease, also called pneumoconiosis, is a lung disorder
caused by breathing coal dust over a long period of time.
   The Supreme Court, in a related 1988 ruling, spared the coal
mining industry from paying potentially billions of dollars in
benefits to as many as 155,000 miners. The justices barred
reopening claims that were denied in the late 1970s and early
1980s.
   But that ruling left open the issue raised in the dispute acted
on today - the validity of Labor Department regulations making it
easier for mine operators to deny benefit claims.
   The regulations give the companies the opportunity to dispute
evidence that miners are suffering from black lung or that they
were incapacitated by their work in the mines.
   Earlier regulations adopted by the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare said the only way the benefits could be
denied is with proof a miner is still working, is capable of
working in the mines or is doing comparable work.
   Some federal appeals courts have upheld the Labor Department
rules. Others have said they conflict with a 1977 federal law aimed
at helping disabled miners.
   Congress created a special fund to pay off claims by miners with
the disease, and required mine operators to contribute to the fund.
   The cases are Pauley vs. Bethenergy Mines, 89-1714; Clinchfield
Coal Co. vs. Office of Workers' Compensation, 90-113; Consolidation
Coal Co. vs. Workers' Compensation Program, 90-114.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Palestinians stayed home from
their jobs in Israel today during a general strike marking the
anniversary of a 1956 massacre of Arab villagers by Israeli
soldiers.
   The strike came a day after Israel lifted a four-day closure of
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and hundreds of Arabs found
they had been replaced in their jobs by Israelis.
   Tensions were briefly raised among Israelis today after an
Israeli Arab soldier was found shot to death. But police and army
sources concluded the 19-year-old Druse soldier probably committed
suicide.
   Last week's attacks on Israelis - which included the fatal
stabbing of a woman soldier and knifing of two other women soldiers
- led to the four-day closure of the occupied territories.
   Leaders of a 34-month-old Palestinian uprising have repeatedly
urged slayings of Israels as revenge for the Temple Mount shooting
deaths of 20 Arabs on Oct. 8.
   The dead soldier was identified by a military spokesman as Cpl.
Hareb Hatham, 19, of Beit Jann village in northern Israel, which is
predominantly Druse. The Druse are a minority Arab sect that is
loyal to Israel. Unlike most Israeli Arabs, their men serve in the
armed forces.
   A police commander, Albert Musafia, said the shooting late
Sunday was probably a suicide.
   Army sources initially said there was evidence Hatham could have
been killed by guerrillas, but later agreed with the suicide
theory. The body was found at the Golani junction, about 10 miles
north of the occupied West Bank.
   Today's strike in the West Bank and Gaza Strip paralyzed
commerce in the territories.
   It was called by the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or
Zeal, to mark 34 years since the killing of 49 Israeli Arabs by
soldiers in Kfar Qassem.
   The killings occurred during the 1956 Suez War, in which Israel
attacked Egypt in an effort to break a two-year Egyptian blockade
of its southern ports. At the time, curfews were imposed on most
Arab areas in Israel. Troops opened fire on orders to shoot curfew
violaters, but their Arab victims were mostly workers returning
home from jobs, unaware of the restrictions.
   There were some vain attempts by Palestinian activists to call
off today's strike to avoid having more Arabs fired because of
prolonged absences from work. But Arab labor leaders claimed the
strike hurt Israel as well since its economy still depended on the
work force of about 150,000 Palestinians.
   Hundreds of Palestinians found Sunday that they had been
replaced during the four-day closure of the territories. Israel
closed the lands because of attacks on Israelis in revenge for the
Temple Mount killings, in which police opened fire on
stone-throwing Arabs.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling on Kansas City Desegregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that boosted a federal judge's power to order predominantly white
suburban schools to accept inner-city black students.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by three
Kansas City, Mo., suburban school districts facing such a
desegregation order.
   The case is an outgrowth of a longstanding court battle over
desegregation of Kansas City's public schools.
   The fight led last April to an important Supreme Court ruling
that federal judges may order local officials to raise property
taxes to help desegregate public schools.
   That 5-4 ruling upheld key features of a 1985 decision by U.S.
District Judge Russell Clark in a 1977 lawsuit by black parents
seeking to reverse the decline of the city's predominantly black
schools.
   The case acted on today grew out of Clark's 1985 order that
Missouri officials pay for transportation and tuition of black
students in Kansas City who choose to transfer to predominantly
white suburban schools.
   Clark described the plan as voluntary on the part of the
suburban schools and the black students.
   But school officials in the suburban districts of North Kansas
City, Lee's Summit and Independence said they are being coerced
into accepting the black transfers.
   They asked the high court to overturn a May ruling by the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said Clark's 1985 order is being
ignored unlawfully.
   Since 1985, the appeals court said, ``not a single suburban
school district has admitted a single black student from (Kansas
City) pursuant to a plan negotiated by the state and the suburban
school districts. Further delay cannot be countenanced.''
   The appeals court noted that 134 black students from Kansas City
applied for admission into the three suburban school districts in
1988. The appeals court said the suburban districts did not admit
the students, apparently due to worries the state would not
reimburse the costs.
   After the black students were denied admission, they filed a new
lawsuit that was assigned to U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Stevens
Jr.
   Stevens threw out the suit last year. But the 8th Circuit court,
in its May ruling, reversed Stevens and reassigned the case to
Clark with instructions to come up with a plan for transferring
black students to the suburban schools.
   The appeals court said the previous refusal of the suburban
schools to admit the blacks raised questions about whether they
were practicing unlawful racial bias.
   In the appeal acted on today, the suburban school officials said
their districts have no history of racial bias, and said it is
unfair to use their refusal to admit students from another city as
evidence of discrimination.
   The appeals court is ``using sheer force to impose its values''
on public schools that have no record of racial bias, the officials
said.
   The Supreme Court in 1974 struck down a Detroit-area school
desegregation plan that required students to be bused across ity
boundaries. The justices said such remedies are inappropriate
unless all districts involved contributed to the segregation.
   The case acted on today is Lee's Summit vs. Naylor, 90-391.

   The justices said they will use Coleman's case to study further
how easy it should be for death row imates to challenge their state

<HEAD>New York Utilities Can't Force Customers to Subsidize Charitable
Contributions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let any New
York utility force customers, through the rates they pay, to
subsidize its charitable contributions.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by New York's
highest court that said allowing publicly regulated utilities to
include such charitable giving in their rates violates customers'
rights.
   Lawyers for the New York Telephone Co. and Rochester Gas and
Electric Corp. told the justices the state court ruling ``creates a
revolutionary new federal right'' with ``alarming national
implications.''
   About half the states and even some federal regulatory agencies
deem reasonable levels of charitable contributions ``ordinary
business expenses'' that may be built into a utility company's
customer rates.
   The New York Public Service Commission, which regulates utility
rates in that state, first allowed charitable giving to be included
in the ratebase in 1970.
   Joseph Cahill, a resident of Fishkill, N.Y., and a New York
Telephone customer, challenged the commission's policy. So did
state Attorney General Robert Abrams in a separate lawsuit against
Rochester Gas and Electric.
   The suits were combined, and a state trial judge ruled that
policy allowing charitable contributions to be included in the
ratebase violates cusomers' free-speech rights.
   The New York Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last May.
   ``Ratepayers are entitled to protection against forced financial
support for causes and messages personally distasteful to them,''
the state court said. ``The utilities have not fulfilled their
burden of justification for imposing on their ratepayers, rather
than on their shareholders, the bill for their selected
philanthropy.''
   The state court relied heavily on a 1977 Supreme Court ruling in
which the justices barred unions from using mandatory fees
collected from non-members they represent for anything unrelated to
collective bargaining.
   The 1977 ruling was one in a series of decisions in which the
high court said the Constitution's First Amendment not only
protects the right to speak and associate freely but also the right
not to speak or associate.
   Documents submitted in the New York case appeared to disagree
over just what charitable contributions were at issue.
   Lawyers for New York Telephone said the company ``does not
engage in political, religious or ideological giving.''
   But the state court's ruling last May said New York Telephone
and Rochester Gas and Electric had contributed to ``numerous
charities, including politically and religiously active
organizations.''
   Cahill's lawyers said he is a lifelong Roman Catholic who
objected, among other things, to charitable contributions made to
organizations that advocate abortion rights.
   In a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief, United Ways of America urged
the justices to reverse the state court ruling. United Ways said
that $55.8 million of the $682 million in corporate contributions
it received last year came from utility companies.
   The case is New York Telephone Co. vs. Cahill, 90-255.

Rastafarians</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today refused to let New
York prison authorities give short haircuts to newly arrived
inmates belonging to a Jamaica-based religion called Rastafarians.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the
haircut policy violates the inmates' religious freedom.
   Rastafarians, adherents of a Jamaica-based religion founded on a
belief that the late Ethiopia Emperor Haile Selassie is God, have
religious scruples against men cutting or combing their hair.
   They wear their hair in ropelike strands known as dreadlocks.
   At New York prisons, all incoming inmates are required to get a
short haircut and have an identification photograph made. The
photograph is to be used in the event of an escape.
   After the photo is taken, however, inmates are free to grow
their hair to whatever length they please.
   Rastafarian inmates challenged the haircut policy in 1979, and
for nearly six years negotiated with prison officials in search of
a settlement.
   A federal judge in 1986, and in subsequent rulings, barred
prison authorities from enforcing the initial haircut policy. The
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the haircut policy ban
last May.
   ``Accepting the existence of reasonable security concerns, we
find there is an alternative that can accommodate both parties,''
the appeals court said.
   It noted that U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton had found
that pulling an inmate's hair back in a ponytail while taking the
identification photo would meet a prison's security needs.
   Prison officials had argued that Stanton was wrong about that,
but the appeals court said the officials ``failed to establish that
the accommodation here has more than a (minimal) effect on valid
penological interests.''
   In the appeal acted on today, New York prison authorities said
the appeals court ruling conflicts with a pair of 1987 Supreme
Court decisions on inmate rights.
   In one, the court gave states sweeping power to prevent inmates
from corresponding with inmates in other prisons. In the other, the
justices ruled that prison officials acted properly when forbidding
some Muslims from attending weekly prison worship services.
   The case is Coughlin vs. Benjamin, 90-307.

   An 11-year-old boy who won, and then lost, a
$95 million award against the maker of an anti-nausea drug his
mother took during pregnancy lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling that
threw out Sekou Ealy's legal victory over Marion Merrell Dow Inc.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case, but
four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Sekou's mother, Sandra, took the drug Bendectin while pregnant,
and he was born with defects in his hands and arms.
   Sekou has three fingers on one hand and four on the other, and
no thumbs. His arms are underdeveloped and locked at the elbows.
   According to court papers, Sekou has undergone weekly
psychiatric therapy to address his mental fixation that his parents
cut off his fingers to punish him for being naughty.
   Bendectin was marketed between 1957 and 1983 by
Richardson-Merrell Inc., now Marion Merrell Dow based in Kansas
City, Mo. More than 30 million women used the drug.
   The company stopped selling Bendectin in 1983, although the
Federal Drug Administration never has rescinded approval of the
drug.
   After a federal court trial in the District of Columbia, where
the Ealys lived, a jury awarded Sekou $20 million in compensatory
damages and $75 million in punitive damages.
   U.S. District Judge June L. Green set aside the punitive-damages
award but let stand the $20 million compensatory-damages award.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here overturned that award
last March.
   The appeals court ruled that the expert testimony used in an
attempt to link Bendectin to the birth defects ``was without
scientific foundation.''
   ``It may well be that future scientific research will generate
... an adequate basis for an expert's opinion that Bendectin ...
caused a plaintiff's birth defects,'' the appeals court said.
   ``Until that day, the existing body of published epidemiological
studies, all finding no significant statistical association between
ingestion of Bendectin and birth defects, must be recognized as the
measuring stick for the admissibility of expert testimony on this
issue,'' the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Sekou said the appeals
court's treatment of testimony by expert witnesses conflicts with
how nine other federal appeals courts have dealt with expert
testimony.
   The appeal argued that the appeals court at least should order a
new trial, rather than throw out the suit against the drug
manufacturer.
   The case is Ealy vs. Richardson-Merrell, 90-225.

<HEAD>Court Asks Bush Administration for Views on Arkansas Voting Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration for its views of an appeal by black voters in a
rural Arkansas County who say the election system in party
primaries and countywide general elections is racially biased.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before saying whether it will decide if the runoff election systems
violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Lower courts said it does
not.
   The Justice Department response may take months.
   Under Arkansas law, a candidate for a political party's
nomination or for a countywide office must receive a majority of
the votes cast in a primary election to win a political party's
nomination.
   If no candidate wins an outright majority, a runoff election is
held two weeks later between the top two vote-getters.
   The justices were told that Arkansas is one of 10 states
employing such a system, ``all of them in the South and all of them
with a long history of purposeful racial vote dilution.''
   The other states were identified as Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and
Oklahoma.
   The runoff system, as it operates in Phillips County, Ark., was
challenged as illegal by black voters who say their voting power is
being diluted.
   Their lawsuit also alleged that the runoff requirements were
adopted and maintained for the purpose of blunting black voting
power.
   Blacks comprise 52 percent of the population in Phillips County,
located on the Mississippi River, but only 47 percent of the
county's voting-age residents are black.
   No black candidate ever has received the Democratic or
Republican nomination for, or been elected to, any countywide
office in Phillips County since the turn of the century.
   In the two most recent election years, four black candidates
received the highest percentage of votes in their Democratic
primary races but were defeated in runoffs by white candidates who
had trailed them in the first election.
   By contrast, no white candidate who has come out on top in a
first primary without winning a majority of all votes has ever lost
the ensuing runoff.
   Black voters who challenged the election system cited as major
reasons for such results the lack of access to motor vehicles and
telephones for many black residents.
   Only 9 percent of white households in Phillips County have no
vehicle available, and 10.9 percent have no telephone, the justices
were told. But 42 percent of black households have no vehicle and
30 percent have no telephone.
   A federal trial judge threw out the black voters' suit, ruling
that they could not invoke the Voting Rights Act because blacks
comprise a majority of the county's population.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed the trial judge's ruling by a 2-1 vote, and said the
runoff system had violated the federal law in Phillips County.
   But the entire 8th Circuit court last May voted 5-5 to uphold
the trial judge's ruling - killing the suit.
   The case is Whitfield vs. Clinton, 90-383.

   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny
appeared bound for overwhelming victory today in the country's
first contested presidential election, which the opposition said
was stolen through massive fraud.
   It was the first time a leader of one of Africa's one-party
states was being challenged at the polls since a wave of protests
and rioting for democracy began sweeping sub-Saharan Africa early
this year.
   With about one-third of the ballots counted by midday today,
Interior Ministry official Claude Regnier said Houphouet-Boigny had
captured about 85 percent of votes. The count was being done at the
ministry.
   But the 85-year-old president's sole challenger -
socialist-minded history Professor Laurent Gbagbo - said a computer
count by his Popular Front gave Gbagbo a lead of 51 percent to
Houphouet-Boigny's 49 percent.
   He called the election a ``masquerade'' of democracy and said
his supporters were being rounded up and arrested.
   The government denied the charges of fraud.
   Abidjan was tense but calm today, with armed soldiers guarding
the Interior Ministry. Gbagbo's followers appeared to be awaiting
the final results.
   In the working-class suburb of Yopougon, opposition militants
reportedly barricaded a street in front of their party office, and
soldiers dismantled the barricade and broke down the office door.
But they went away without making any arrests.
   Gbagbo produced hundreds of ballots marked for Houphouet-Boigny,
which he said had come from one of dozens of boxes stuffed to rig
the elections.
   His supporters said they had smashed ballot boxes to halt voting
Sunday at several polling stations. They claimed boxes were stuffed
with votes for Houphouet-Boigny before the polling started.
   In London, prices of cocoa dropped as news spread that
Houphouet-Boigny would apparently retain power. Ivory Coast is the
world's biggest cocoa producer, and experts say its crop helps
determine whether the world market remains in surplus.
   Gbagbo said the Democratic Party of Houphouet-Boigny, who has
ruled since Ivory Coast's independence from France in 1960, also
publicized voting stations that did not exist and set up balloting
stations that were not advertised.
   There were also reports of disorganization at several voting
stations, where ballot papers and electoral lists did not arrive or
were delivered hours late.
   Interior Minister Leon Konan Koffi called the opposition
accusations lies. He told reporters Gbagbo's supporters destroyed
ballot boxes to stop elections they knew they would lose.
   Konan Koffi said the opposition forced nine voting stations in
Abidjan to shut. Gbagbo confirmed his ``party militants'' halted
elections in 50 stations of one Abidjan suburb alone, and at
numerous other places nationwide.
   Government officials first said preliminary results were
expected Sunday night, but later said they were delayed by
difficulties getting results from remote villages.
   Gbagbo said he would decide whether to accept the election
results after they were announced, but regardless, he said, the
election was worth it.
   ``Nobody ever thought we would get multiparty democracy while
Houphouet-Boigny was in Ivory Coast,'' he said. ``It was time to
put a stop to the system of there being just a single candidate.''
   Legislative elections are scheduled next month. Some 26
political parties have sprung up since Houphouet-Boigny was forced
to legalize political opposition after weeks of rioting led by
students and joined by the urban poor.

<HEAD>Court Won't Kill Suit Against Prison Medical Director in Indiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
lawsuit against the medical director of a federal prison in Indiana
accused of deliberately neglecting the health needs of inmates.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the official
may be sued by the heirs of a prisoner who died after an asthma
attack.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that Dr.
Robert Brutsche, the medical director, is not automatically immune
from being sued over Joseph Jones' death in 1975.
   The appeals court said that by 1975 prison officials were on
notice that depriving inmates of adequate health care was a
violation of their rights, even though there was no nationwide
legal precedent on the issue then.
   ``We believe that a failure to correct systemic deficiencies in
the delivery of health care services at a prison violated clearly
established law in 1975,'' the appeals court said. ``A clear trend
in the case law'' then showed ``a controlling precedent was merely
a question of time,'' the appeals court said.
   Jones died soon after he was admitted to the Terre Haute prison
hospital with difficulty breathing. Robert DeGracias, the prison
doctor, prescribed a drug over the telephone and ordered Jones sent
to a local civilian hospital.
   Jones was the fourth inmate at Terre Haute who died of medical
causes during the first eight months of 1975.
   After Jones died, Brutsche ordered an investigation that led him
to recommend improved medical care for inmates.
   Jones' mother sued, accusing Brutsche and DeGracias of
deliberate indifference to her son's health.
   A federal judge refused to dismiss the suit, ruling there were
numerous questions to be answered about care of inmates in
life-threatening emergencies.
   The 7th Circuit court noted that in 1982, the Supreme Court held
that public officials are shielded from suit unless they violate a
clearly established right.
   The appeals court said in Brutsche's case there were at least
three federal appeals court rulings that indicated ``a clear
consensus had been reached that a prison official's failure to
remedy systemic deficiencies in medical services ... constituted
deliberate indifference.''
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject
Brutsche's appeal, even though it said it disagrees with the
appeals court ruling.
   Justice Department lawyers said further examination of the case
by lower courts could be helpful. For example, the government said,
Brutsche should not be made a scapegoat if there is evidence the
conditions at Terre Haute were caused by a scarcity of competent
personnel.
   The high court on Oct. 15 agreed to study a related issue
surrounding immunity for public officials from such suits. The
issue in that case is whether the suits must be dismissed at the
outset when the alleged official misconduct is based largely on a
subjective interpretation of events by those doing the suing.
   The case acted on today is Brutsche, vs. Cleveland-Perdue,
89-1167.

   A missing toddler was found dying under the bed of
a man who had escaped from prison while serving a sentence for
sexual battery.
   Yoanna Maria Noda, who would have been 2 Wednesday, was
discovered Sunday after a police search of the apartment of Alcides
Medina Quiles, 27. Officers tried to revive the girl, but she was
pronounced dead at Jackson Memorial Hospital, police spokesman
Bobby Navarro said.
   An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of death.
   Quiles was being held without bond pending a court appearance
today on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual
battery.
   Police said an FBI fingerprint check identified Quiles as an
escapee from a state prison in Hartford, Conn. He was serving an
18-year sentence on sexual battery charges when he escaped in
August, the FBI said.
   Police canvassed the western Miami neighborhood Sunday morning
after the child's family called to say she was missing.
   A witness told detectives she had seen a child playfully chasing
a chicken down the street. The witness said she saw a man she
assumed was the girl's father lead the child off the street and out
of sight, police said.
   The search eventually led to Quiles' apartment building.
   Quiles twice let investigators look through his rooms, which
police said he rented about two weeks ago under a false name.
   ``He took the police into his apartment, not once, but twice.
And he sat right there while they were looking,'' said detective
Ronnie Ilhardt. ``But when the body was found, he ran out the
door.''
   Quiles was captured after a short chase, said homicide detective
Oscar Tejeda.

<HEAD>Ruling Stands that Norfolk, Va., Voting System Violates Rights of
Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that the at-large system used in Norfolk, Va., city council
elections violates the rights of black voters.
   A federal appeals court panel last Aug. 18 ordered the city to
switch to a single-district election system that will ``remedy the
vote dilution arising out of the at-large election system.''
   The Norfolk City Council has seven members, elected to staggered
four-year terms. Elections for three or four of the council seats
are held every two years. Candidates with the most votes citywide
win, and do not need a majority of the votes cast.
   A group of black voters and the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People sued in 1983,
contending that the at-large system used since 1918 illegally
blunted the political clout of black voters.
   Norfolk, one of Virginia's largest cities, is 35 percent black
in population. Blacks also comprise 35 percent of the city's
registered voters.
   The city council did not have a black member until 1968, and
since then has had one black member most years.
   The NAACP and black voters who sued said if city council members
were elected from seven single-member districts, black voters would
be in the majority in three of the seven districts.
   The city's voting dispute reached the nation's highest court
once before, and in 1986 was sent back to lower courts for more
study.
   U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. in Norfolk ruled in
1988 that the at-large election system did not violate the federal
Voting Rights Act, but a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed his ruling.
   The panel, by a 2-1 vote, said the at-large system gives black
voters ``less opportunity than other members of the electorate to
participate in the electoral process and to elect representatives
of their choice.''
   The panel said those who sued ``do not seek proportional
representation, and the act does not require it.''
   But it said the lack of success blacks have had in winning more
``token representation'' on the city council show the existence of
``white bloc voting ... in Norfolk.''
   The appeals court panel ordered Clarke to block all future
at-large elections and to require the city to come up with a new
election system in a ``reasonable, specified time'' to be reviewed
under Voting Rights Act standards.
   ``If the city fails to enact a legal plan, (Clarke) should
prepare a single-district plan for the conduct of future
elections,'' the appeals court panel said.
   The full 4th Circuit court split 5-5 in refusing to review the
three-judge panel's decision.
   The panel's decision was held in abeyance pending today's action
by the Supreme Court. The panel's ruling that the city elections
system must change now will take effect.
   In their appeal, city officials said the August decision forcing
a change ``is nothing more than a decision to require ...
proportional representation.''
   ``If that ruling is correct,'' the appeal said, ``then all
at-large election systems are imperiled.''
   Asked for its views, the Bush administration told the court to
reject the city's appeal.
   ``Although the court of appeals' analysis is not without flaws,
the court's errors ... either do not affect the outcome of the case
orare too closely tied to its particular facts to be of general
significance,'' Justice Department lawyers said.
   The case is Norfolk vs. Collins, 89-989.

Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A United Nations conference on global warming
opened today, and a top U.N. official warned that only radical
changes can save the world from a climate disaster.
   Mostafa K. Tolba, the head of the U.N. Environment Program, said
the threat of global warming is ``potentially more catastrophic
than any other threat in human history.''
   Such warming could trigger famine by disrupting agriculture, and
coastal areas could be flooded if sea levels are raised by melting
of glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet.
   Scientists believe about half of global warming is caused by
carbon dioxide gas from fossil fuel burning. Other ``greenhouse
gases'' are methane, nitrous oxide, and chemicals called
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   The gases increase the atmosphere's tendency to trap heat, like
a greenhouse.
   ``Nothing short of action which affects every individual can
forestall global catastrophe,'' Tolba said. ``Nothing less than a
complete change in attitudes and lifestyles will succeed.''
   The gathering brought together about 500 scientists from around
the world, who are to chart a comprehensive new program with
proposals on how to counter global warming, or the greenhouse
effect.
   The conference will wind up with a two-day meeting of about 80
government ministers. Several heads of government, including
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and French Prime
Minister Michel Rocard, are to attend.
   The United States, still opposed to mandatory restrictions on
emissions of the chemicals involved, is represented by a
lower-ranking official, John Knauss, head of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
   The opening of the Geneva conference coincided with a meeting of
environment ministers of the 12-nation European Community to
address carbon dioxide emission controls.
   At the Geneva session, a final declaration on Nov. 7 will
provide the basis for the first formal negotiations on an accord on
fighting global warming. The pact is to be ready for signing in
mid-1992.
   Tolba said the convention must spell out specific commitments to
cut emissions. But he said the industrialized nations, which emit
three-fourths of all man-made greenhouse gases, must act now and
not wait for the agreement.
   ``The longer we delay, the worse the disaster will be for our
children, and for our children's children,'' he said.
   Curbing emissions ``will cost vast sums and will demand great
changes in economic, legal and institutional systems,'' Tolba said.
But he said the cost of inaction would be far greater.
   Developing nations, he said, would need more time, funds and
access to Western technology to reduce emissions.
   During the past two years, more than 1,000 scientists from 70
countries have compiled a bulky report for the conference which
list grim scenarios of what might happen unless action is taken to
reduce global warming.
   They predict that continuing on the current course would send
global temperatures up 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the
next century, the fastest rise in 10,000 years.
   Barring countermeasures, global sea levels would rise by about
two feet, the report said. In the next century, rising sea levels
could flood tens of thousands of miles of densely populated
shorelines.
   The warming trend would also disrupt agricultural production
worldwide.
   But the U.N. Food and Agriculture Administration, in a position
paper prepared for the Geneva conference, said the overall effect
on global farming could actually be positive because of the opening
up of arable lands toward the poles. But in some vulnerable
regions, the effect ``may be very serious,'' it added.
   Experts generally agree that the trend toward a warmer Earth
cannot be stopped but could be mitigated by a shifting to other
forms of energy and stopping the destruction of forests around the
world. They agree much more research on the problem is needed.

<HEAD>Riot Police Fire at Students in Zimbabwe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fired warning shots over the
heads of rioting students today, the third day of violent protests
against tighter state control over the country's university.
   Teachers, also angered that the University of Zimbabwe has lost
much of its autonomy under a 4-day-old bill, said they would mount
their own peaceful demonstration on Tuesday.
   Police said at least five students have been arrested, including
the president of the Student's Representative Council, Christopher
Giwa.
   The students were taken in on Friday after refusing to disperse
in downtown Harare. They are to appear in court to face charges of
breaching the peace.
   Since the latest round of anti-government protests began
Thursday, students have stormed the university, smashed windows and
set fire to gardens and trees. Classes have been boycotted and
year-end examinations, scheduled to begin this morning, disrupted.
   Today, riot police guarding university buildings fired warning
shots to disperse students hurling bricks and stones. Elsewhere on
campus, police fired tear gas to break-up hostile student groups.
   The students are protesting amendments to the University Act
passed by parliament on Thursday. The amendments give the
state-appointed vice chancellor of the university sweeping
disciplinary powers.
   The bill also empowers the higher education minister to
interfere in running the university.
   It will become law if signed by President Robert Mugabe, who is
titular chancellor of the university and a critic of student
demonstrators.
   ``The amendments are clearly intended to bring the university
under the direct political control of the government,'' said Tony
Reeler, secretary of the 120-member Association of University
Teachers.
   ``This current legislation will destroy the university,'' he
said.
   In recent years, the university has been a hub of government
opposition.
   While students supported Mugabe at the time of independence 10
years ago, they have recently charged his leadership with
corruption, mismanagement and authoritarianism.
   Under state-of-emergency regulations in October, the government
closed the university for six months following violent clashes with
police.
   More than 480 students in that anti-government protest were
arrested.
   The emergency was lifted, under extreme opposition pressure, in
July.

   The Supreme Court today refused to squelch the
lawsuit of a Tacoma, Wash., woman who says she was raped after a
policeman left her stranded in a high-crime area late at night.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a ruling that will
force a trial on the woman's allegations against Washington State
Trooper Steven Ostrander.
   In a separate case, the court refused to reinstate a $750,000
award won, and then lost, by a woman raped in a Cleveland-area
public transit system parking lot.
   The Tacoma woman's 1985 civil rights suit contends Ostrander
violated her constitutional right by placing her in danger and
failing to provide any protection.
   In other action, the court:
   - Let stand a ruling that boosted a federal judge's power to
order predominantly white suburban schools to accept inner-city
black students.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by three
Kansas City, Mo., suburban school districts facing such a
desegregation order. The case is an outgrowth of a longstanding
court battle over desegregation of Kansas City's public schools.
   - Agreed to resolve a dispute over black lung benefits that may
affect $650 million in claims by coal miners and their families.
   The court said it will decide how difficult it should be for
mining companies to challenge claims by as many as 3,500 miners.
   - Allowed a state to automatically impose longer sentences for
criminals who used guns.
   The court, without comment, let stand a Montana law used to add
10 years to the 30-year prison sentence given a man who brandished
a gun during a pizza shop robbery.
   In a separate case, the court refused to let police in
Massachusetts stop and search someone solely because that person
reportedly was carrying a handgun in public.
   - Let stand a ruling that the at-large system used in Norfolk,
Va., city council elections violates the rights of black voters.
   A federal appeals court panel last Aug. 18 ordered the city to
switch to a single-district election system that will ``remedy the
vote dilution arising out of the at-large election system.''
   - Refused to kill a civil rights lawsuit against a Texas city
that cracked down on ``cruising'' teen-agers five years ago.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that forces
DeSoto, Texas, and nine members of its police department to defend
themselves at trial against allegations of illegal arrests.
   In the Tacoma rape case, at about 2:30 a.m. on Sept. 23, 1984,
Ostrander stopped a car driven by Robert Bell because its
headlights were on high-beam.
   After speaking to Bell, Ostrander arrested him on
drunken-driving charges and called for a tow truck to impound the
car.
   The Tacoma woman claims Ostrander, after ordering her out of the
car, simply got into his patrol car and drove away. He claims he
offered to call a friend or relative who could give her a ride
home, but that she declined his offer.
   Bell's car had been stopped in the Parkland area of Pierce
County, south of Tacoma and about five miles from the woman's home.
Court records indicate the area has the highest violent-crime rate
in the county outside of Tacoma.
   The temperature was 50 degrees, and the woman as wearing only a
blouse and jeans. She says that after walking a half-block toward
her home and having turned down several ride offers from strangers,
she accepted one from an unknown man.
   The woman's suit says the driver took her to a secluded area and
raped her. Her lawyers said the rape impregnated her, and resulted
in the birth of a child.
   A federal judge dismissed the suit but a three-judge panel of
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, voting 2-1, reinstated it.
   The woman ``has raised a genuine issue of fact tending to show
that Trooper Ostrander acted with deliberate indifference to (her)
interest in personal security under the 14th Amendment,'' the
appeals court panel said.
   The appeals court panel discounted the fact that a 24-hour gas
station and a 24-hour convenience store, both well-lighted, were
located within two blocks of where Ostrander left the woman.
   ``It is for the trier of fact to determine whether a reasonable
person should have regarded a gas station or a convenience store,
located in a high-crime neighborhood, as some kind of safe haven
where she would have been given assistance or permitted to stay
until daybreak before walking five miles home,'' the appeals court
said.
   The woman's suit said she could not call her parents for help
because both are disabled.
   In the Cleveland case, the court, without comment, let stand a
ruling that overturned the award against the transit system.
   The Cleveland woman was attacked the evening of Jan. 15, 1985,
after getting off a train at a station in East Cleveland.
   Her assailant later confessed to raping her, as well as another
woman at the same station the previous night.
   The woman sued the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority
for negligence. She said the public agency failed to provide
adequate security for passengers, particularly in light of the rape
the previous night.
   A state court jury awarded her $750,000 after also hearing
evidence that numerous violent crimes were committed at the station
from 1975 to 1985.
   A state appeals court threw out the award last year.
   The appeals court relied on an Ohio Supreme Court ruling that
police may not be sued for failing to protect the public against
crimes - unless it can be shown they ``owed a special duty of
care'' to a crime victim.
   The appeals court said it saw no difference between a regional
transit agency and a city police department.
   ---
   The cases are Ostrander vs. Wood, 89-1409, and Shelton vs.
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, 90-430.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said today the latest mission to Baghdad by a Soviet envoy
indicated there were some shifts in the position of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein.
   Gorbachev, at a news conference following talks with French
President Francois Mitterrand, said he had received a telegram from
the envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, who met Sunday with Saddam. But he did
not elaborate.
   Primakov traveled on to Saudi Arabia for meetings today with
King Fahd.
   At the news conference, Gorbachev said the time was right for
Arab nations to embark on a new initiative to resolve the crisis,
possibly under Saudi Arabian leadership.
   ``It seems to me that the Iraqis could be ready for this,'' he
said. ``If we were to have an inter-Arab meeting, this would be the
quickest way to a settlement.''
   Gorbachev also urged tougher sanctions against Iraq and
suggested that Saddam is beginning to yield to economic pressure.
   ``Under the pressure of sanctions - which have to be stepped up,
of course -some signs are emerging that Iraq's leadership may be
heeding the will of the United Nations,'' he said.
   Gorbachev stressed the importance of maintaining a united front
against Iraq. If Saddam is counting on a split in the alliance
against him, he is ``building his policy on a mistake,'' the Soviet
president said.
   ``We must not permit the Iraqi regime to hope there will be a
division, a weakening of positions,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said he hoped the crisis, which was set off by Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, could be solved without war.
   ``I think it's unacceptable to have a military solution,''
Gorbachev said. But he insisted that Iraq comply with United
Nations calls to free foreign hostages and withdraw from Kuwait.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who has accompanied
Gorbachev on the trip, had said on Sunday night that Primakov's
visit to Baghdad did not appear to have been fruitful.
   ``For the moment there are not many reasons for optimism''
regarding Primakov's talks with Saddam, the Soviet minister said.
But he added that Moscow still held out hope for a negotiated
settlement.
   Mitterrand, also at the news conference, said French and Soviet
positions on the gulf were in harmony.
   ``We will defend the the same principles and the same positions
in the framework of the Security Council,'' he said.
   France's Foreign Ministry said today that French diplomats would
leave their besieged embassy in Kuwait and return to Paris along
with about 300 freed French hostages.
   After the invasion, Iraq ordered embassies in Kuwait to close
down and move their diplomats to Baghdad. A few foreign missions in
Kuwait, including that of the United States, are still holding out.
   ``I express the joy of all the French people to those coming
home,'' Mitterrand said. ``But we will rejoice fully only when the
other hostages can return to their own countries.''
   Mitterrand and Gorbachev spoke to reporters after signing a
cooperation agreement pledging French assistance as the Soviet
Union shifts to a market economy.
   France also promised to help Moscow arrange accords with the
12-nation European Community as a step toward creation of a
pan-European confederation.
   The presidents signed the accord at the chateau of Rambouillet,
33 miles southwest of Paris, following private talks on the gulf
and other issues.
   Gorbachev arrived Sunday evening after a three-day visit to
Spain, where he secured $1.5 billion in guaranteed loans to help
ease the transition away from a centralized economy.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Kill Suit Against Texas City in `Cruising'
Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
civil rights lawsuit against a Texas city that cracked down on
``cruising'' teen-agers five years ago.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that forces
DeSoto, Texas, and nine members of its police department to defend
themselves at trial against allegations of illegal arrests.
   In the early 1980s, DeSoto's Hampton Road became a popular
cruising spot on weekend and summer nights for teen-agers from
Tarrant, Dallas and Ellis counties. On those nights, hundreds of
vehicles would drive up and down the road and hundreds of teens
would congregate in business parking lots.
   There was some vandalism, but the biggest problem was litter.
   Evictions, warnings by police, distribution of leaflets and
speeches about trespass laws had little effect.
   On the night of May 3, 1985, DeSoto police accompanied by Dallas
County sheriff's deputies and constables descended on several
parking lots and arrested about 50 people.
   Six arrested teens sued the city and nine police department
members in federal court. The suit, seeking monetary damages,
alleged the teens' civil rights had been violated by illegal police
arrests.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that the city and its
police department were entitled to a qualified immunity from being
sued. But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the suit
last May.
   In a biting opinion, the appeals court said the case should
proceed to trial.
   ``No doubt some of the arrestees had received prior warnings and
deserved little sympathy for what happened to them that evening,''
the appeals court said. ``The same cannot be said for everyone.
Take, for example, the girls on the Grand Prairie softball team.''
   The appeals court noted that four high school girls from Grand
Prairie in DeSoto for the first time to play in a softball
tournament had pulled into a parking lot two minutes before the
police sweep began.
   The girls, who cooperated at all times with police and other
authorities, were arrested, handcuffed and forced to spend the
night in jail.
   ``It did not stop there,'' the 5th Circuit court wrote. ``The
(trespass) charges were taken up by the criminal district attorney
of Dallas County. To prove how resolute that office is against the
forces of crime, these girls were indicted ... and prosecuted
vigorously in criminal court.
   ``When matters finally reached the hands of sensible people, the
jurors, the girls were acquitted,'' the appeals court said. ``After
three trials ended in acquittals, the remaining indictments were
dismissed.''
   Two of those girls - Kathy Kuehler and Lisa Blair Bishop - are
among the six who sued. The others who sued are Douglas Morgan,
Kerry Curby, Troy Hall and Jeffrey Escue.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for DeSoto argued that the
city and police should be immune from being sued over events
stemming from the cruising crackdown.
   The case is DeSoto vs. Morgan, 90-393.

   Few people face greater stigma than a pregnant
woman burdened by drug addiction. But as Midwest Regional Reporter
Sharon Cohen finds in the second of a three-part series,
``Surviving Year One,'' few drug addicts get less help in battling

   Wanda Kaigler is having her seventh baby and this
time, she has a new goal in life - to become a mother again, and a
drug addict no more.
   She wants to start over, to break free of the crack, heroin,
pills and weed that consumed her for 21 years and robbed her of
everything precious: her health, her pride, even her six children.
   ``All I ever wanted was to get married and have kids and take
care of them,'' she says quietly. ``I got married, I got kids. He
died. The kids got taken. And I'm a drug addict.''
   She's working to change that at the Eleonore Hutzel Recovery
Center, one of a few comprehensive programs in the nation providing
medical care, counseling and housing for pregnant and other
addicted women.
   ``I know that if I can keep drugs out of my system, I can keep
the baby,'' she says. ``There's still a chance I can get my kids
back - maybe.''
   ``I want to give up on myself but I know I can't,'' she adds
tearfully. ``I want to be drug free and I know I can do it. ...
Sometimes, I don't know how to go about it.''
   For most pregnant addicts in America, the problem isn't how, but
where. Public drug treatment programs, in short supply nationwide,
are rarer still for these women, experts say. Traditionally, most
are designed for men.
   ``It's three strikes against you,'' said Ruth Hudicek, head of
Chrysalis House, a residential substance abuse program in Maryland.
   ``The first is you're an addict. The second strike is you're a
female. If a female addict happens to be pregnant, in the eyes of
most of the country, you're at the bottom of the heap.''
   In fact, some proecutors, citing concerns for the children,
have charged pregnant drug users with crimes, sometimes jailing
them.
   Since 1987, more than 50 criminal cases have been filed against
women for drug abuse during pregnancy, about 80 percent of them
minorities, the American Civil Liberties Union says.
   Civil libertarians argue that this drives addicts away from
prenatal care.
   ``Prosecutors are telling them to get clean or be arrested and
they'll take away their kids,'' said the ACLU's Isabelle Pinzler.
``There aren't the places for drug treatment and the places that
exist frequently won't take them.''
   ``It forces them to make a Sophie's choice - either getting
healthy or abandoning the child in foster care or a dysfunctional
family from which they themselves came,'' said her colleague, Lynn
Paltrow.
   More than 5 million women of childbearing age use illegal drugs,
including more than 1 million who take cocaine, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse said in 1988. Up to 375,000 babies may be
exposed to drugs annually, according to the National Association
for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education.
   While those numbers indicate the scope of a problem exacerbated
by the crack epidemic, others suggest glaring inadequacies in
treatment. Consider:
   -Some 280,000 pregnant women nationwide needed drug treatment,
yet less than 30,000 received care, according to a 1990 survey by
the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.
   -Two-thirds of 18 big-city hospitals surveyed last year by a
U.S. House committee had no place to send pregnant women for drug
treatment.
   -A New York study found 54 percent of treatment programs
excluded expectant women; 87 percent rejected pregnant Medicaid
recipients addicted to crack.
   ``They think there will be a terrible malpractice problem,''
because of potential pregnancy complications, speculates Dr. Wendy
Chavkin, the author and an associate professor at the Columbia
School of Public Health.
   All of this is especially frustrating, experts say, because
pregnancy often motivates women to seek help.
   ``If they don't find a program out there, chances are we've lost
them,'' Mrs. Hudicek said. ``Some die. Some end up in hospital
emergency rooms giving birth to crack-addicted babies.''
   ``Part of the American way is motherhood and apple pie,'' she
added. ``The stigma that women face ... admitting they're addicted
to drugs is incredible.''
   Cynthia, a Chrysalis House resident and new mother, knows the
feeling.
   ``You already have low self-esteem,'' said the recovering
cocaine-heroin addict, who asked that her last name not be used.
``Finally you do humble yourself to say ... `I have a problem,' and
there's a bunch of excuses. ... They say, `We can't help you now.
Come back in 30 days.' You may die, you may get incarcerated.''
   Or you may get sick. Cocaine, doctors say, increases the risk of
premature delivery and life-threatening hemorrhages and can cause
physical and neurological damage to babies.
   Pregnant addicts often ignore their health. One Michigan woman
said it was easier to walk four houses to buy crack than take a bus
four miles for prenatal care. Others sell furniture, food stamps,
even themselves for drugs.
   About 180 addicts are in Hutzel's 21-year-old program; about
half are pregnant and 50 percent of those women take methadone to
prevent miscarriages.
   Hutzel provides counseling, child care, lunch, transportation
and prenatal care. The residential recovery program houses women
and their young children in a former convent.
   Many have long histories of addiction. Wanda Kaigler, now 37,
says her drug use began at age 16. She nearly died six years ago
from bad heroin, and though she survived and even quit once, her
habit has stripped her bare.
   ``It makes you lose your friends, your family, your furniture,
your home, your respect for yourself,'' she said. ``You feel
terrible afterwards. As long as you do it, you feel good.''
   A widow for three years, Miss Kaigler also lost her six
children, ages 2 to 17, when they were removed by authorities. She
wants them back, proudly noting two are honors students.
   ``I love my kids,'' she said. ``They don't think so. Sometimes,
I don't think so.''
   Kelly Barrington's concern for her baby, coupled with the threat
of losing her 9-year-old daughter, led her to Hutzel.
   ``God knew the only way I was going to stop is if I got
pregnant,'' said Miss Barrington, a drug abuser for 15 of her 31
years who switched to crack from heroin after her veins collapsed.
``I couldn't live with the fact that I hurt an innocent baby.''
   She, too, had hit bottom. She was jailed briefly, lost
everything and was so desperate she'd drag her daughter to dope
houses, explaining she was sick and ``that was the medicine I
needed.''
   Her daughter responded by repeatedly breaking her crack pipes.
   ``I try to forgive myself and say I was a sick person,'' said
Miss Barrington, her purse adorned with badges for every month she
has been drug-free. ``I feel great that God gave me another chance
to turn things around.''

   Eighty percent to 85 percent of the women complete Hutzel's
pregnancy program, which serves about 250 females a year. About a
quarter continue in recovery, but more than half of those who
inquire never show up.
   Some fear prosecutions will deter even more.
   A Massachusetts judge this month threw out an indictment
charging a 24-year-old mother with drug distribution for cocaine
found in her infant son.
   ``By imposing criminal sanctions, a woman may turn away from
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered, thereby
undermining the state's asserted interests,'' Boston Superior Court
Judge Suzanne V. DelVecchio said in her ruling.
   But some prosecutors say they must help the children - even if
means charging and jailing pregnant women.
   ``Innocent children are horribly damaged by the use of cocaine.
If that's not child abuse, I don't know what is,'' said Charles
Condon, a South Carolina solicitor who helps run a program in which
pregnant users must enroll in treatment or risk arrest.
   ``We don't want them to be prosecuted,'' he said, but ``you
really have to give them consequences for their behavior.''
   At Hutzel, Wanda Kaigler knows all about consequences. But she
plans to stay clean and dreams of living with her kids ``away from
drugs.''
   ``Anything you have faith in and believe in,'' she said, ``you
can have.''

   Non-Communist parties won elections in

Union, private ownership of land and a capitalist economy,
officials said Monday.
   ``We are certainly going to have a majority in parliament,''
said Zviad Gamsakhurdia, leader of the victorious Round Table-Free
Georgia bloc of political parties.
   With about 90 percent of the regions reporting, Gamsakhurdia
claimed victory in about 70 percent.
   He protested what he called ``gross violations'' of the election
law and said Communist authorities ``terrorized the non-Georgian
population'' along the borders of the mountainous southern
republic, which is dotted with pockets of Azerbaijani and other
ethnic groups.
   A member of the central election commission, Alexander Kobalia,
said that preliminary results showed a slightly less sweeping
victory for Gamsakhurdia's Round Table, with the bloc winning about
60 percent of the vote versus 30 percent for the Communist Party.
   The final results will be ready on Wednesday, and a runoff will
be held for close races on Nov. 11, he said.
   No date has been set yet for convening the Georgian Supreme
Soviet legislature, which is expected to declare independence from
the Soviet Union.
   Among the 15 Soviet republics, all but Kirgizia have declared
some form of sovereignty or independence.
   Gamsakhurdia said he was unable to specify what his first
proposal would be in parliament. ``I can't decide that alone,''
said Gamsakhurdia, an imposing 51-year-old with a history of
arrests and opposition to Communist rule dating back to the 1950s.
   Another Round Table spokesman, Georgi Makaridze, said the
victory would translate into about 120 seats in the 250-member
Supreme Soviet. ``Along with other non-Communist parties, we will
have a working majority in parliament,'' Makaridze said.
   In a weekend interview, Gamsakhurdia predicted that Georgia's
transition to independence would take about two years, and that the
republic would maintain extensive economic relations with the
Soviet Union. It also seemed likely that Georgia would rely on the
Soviet Union in national security matters.
   About 35 parties, most grouped by coalition, took part in
Sunday's election, the first true multiparty vote in Soviet
history.
   Non-Communists have won elections in several cities and
republics elsewhere in the Soviet Union, but the Georgian balloting
was the first in which formal parties, created under new Soviet
laws, were listed on the ballot.
   Some politicians boycotted the election, claiming it was not
democratic. One of them, the leader of the National Democratic
Party, Gia Chanturia, was shot in the arm Friday as he left a
political meeting.
   Two National Democratic Party members, Gia Kobakhedze and Irakli
Tsereteli, spoke on Georgian television and accused Gamsakhurdia of
organizing the shooting on orders from Soviet authorities.
   Gamsakhurdia denied responsibility for the shooting, and accused
authorities in an interview Sunday of trying to sabotage the
election by not telling people where to vote.
   Under a complicated election system, each voter was given two
ballots, one listing individual candidates and the other listing
political parties and blocs.
   Half the members of the legislature were to be chosen from the
lists of individual candidates to represent various districts. The
rest were to be chosen at large, in proportion to the number of
votes cast for each party or bloc throughout Georgia.
   Under the republic's election law, a party must get at least 4
percent of the republic-wide vote to gain representation in the
legislature. That was a provision designed to encourage coalitions
and large parties, and to discourage splintering into small
factions.

<HEAD>Time-Zone Activists Want to Make Winter Brighter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The harsh cold of a Chicago winter is bad enough,
but seeing the sun go down before you even get off work makes it
worse. The { Hour Time Zone Lobby says it's found a way to make
winter a little brighter.
   The solution is splitting the wide Central Standard Time zone in
half, and moving up the clock - effectively delaying sunset - by
half an hour in Chicago and the rest of the zone's eastern portion,
says Ken Peterson, the group's leader.
   ``Chicago hasn't recognized that it's at a severe
disadvantage,'' said Peterson, a 49-year-old architect from the
suburb of Forest Park.
   The sun sets an hour earlier for Chicagoans, on the eastern edge
of the zone, than for residents of Bismarck, N.D., at the western
edge.
   Combine that with the shorter days of winter and the end of
daylight-savings time, and Chicagoans don't need sunglasses after
work.
   ``It all goes back to why do people hate Chicago in the
winter,'' Peterson said. ``We hate it because it's dark when we go
home.
   ``Rush hour is bad enough. But when it's dark, it's really bad.
Then, when you add sleet, snow and hail, it's a real downer.''
   Under the lobbying group's plan, when it's 5 p.m. in Bismarck,
it would already be 5:30 p.m. in Chicago and workers would have had
a chance to see the sun after leaving the office.
   The group says that extra dose of sunlight might be enough to
help cure winter doldrums.
   The group placed an ad in a newspaper this week asking for
public feedback on their proposal.
   Peterson, who began organizing the group this month, knows some
might scoff at his solution, but he's standing by his principles.
   ``People can label me a loony and the idea may go nowhere,'' he
said. ``But people have a right to know they can have more sunlight
in the afternoon.''

   The preacher wears jeans and a western
shirt. The worshipers sit on bar stools. The offering plate is a
cowboy hat.
   It's the Nashville Cowboy Church, which holds services in a
hotel lounge.
   Harry Yates, 47, the minister-founder of the church, says
cowboys attended church services in saloons, so since late
September he's been preaching every Sunday in the hotel lounge.
   ``We've been called a few names here and there about meeting in
the bar and dressing the way we do,'' Yates said. ``I seem to
remember that Jesus was called a wine bibber. I think we're in good
company. We're supposed to preach the gospel everywhere.''
   Yates' clerical garb for the non-denominational service is
jeans, western shirt, bolo tie and cowboy hat - the collection
plate.
   ``We're not doctrinal, and I just preach a short message, 15 or
20 minutes,'' he said.
   Yates, ordained in the Independent Assemblies of God, doesn't
rail against drinking and carousing and the like.
   ``We don't preach against things. We just preach the gospel of
Jesus Christ.''
   A couple of guitar players supply the music.
   When services are over, worshipers get $2 off the price of
brunch at the hotel restaurant. ``It's an incentive,'' Yates said.
   Attendance has averaged more than 30 even though the church is
just getting started. Roughly half are tourists, many of whom spent
the night before listening to cry-in-your-beer country music at the
Grand Ole Opry three miles down the road.
   ``Tourists come to town and don't bring suits and ties,'' Yates
said. ``At our services, you can dress any way you like. We're
trying to take away excuses for not going to church.''
   Bob Darmos, a manager for a Nashville trash company, has been
attending the church regularly.
   ``I was skeptical at first, going to a saloon and being so
casual. But you can relax, be yourself and worship. It puts you in
the right frame of mind.''
   ``I can go in a shirt and jeans and no one looks down his nose
at me,'' he said. ``The pastor is dressed the same way I am. There
are no false airs.''

<HEAD>Sacramento Merger Would Create Seventh-Largest City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HOWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters could turn this tranquil
capital into the nation's seventh-largest city if they approve a
plan to merge with the county.
   If approved Nov. 6 by county voters, the proposal would create a
sprawling, 1,000-square mile city with a population estimated at
1.04 million - slightly more populous than Dallas and a shade less
than San Diego.
   The nation's 10 largest cities would be New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Sacramento, Dallas,
Detroit, and San Antonio. Sacramento County, which includes the
city, has grown by 32 percent during the past decade, from a
population of 786,000 in 1980 to 1.04 million this year. The city
alone has about 350,000 residents.
   But while many here relish the thought of putting this city once
known largely for its politicians and hot summers on the map - and
in top-10 lists - they disagree sharply over the merger's economic
merits.
   Consolidation has been rejected twice by Sacramento County
voters, most recently in 1974. Surveys this time show opinion
closely divided.
   Several other cities have merged with counties, including
Portland, Ore., Nashville, Tenn., and Minneapolis. Modern-day San
Francisco is the product of merger accomplished in 1856.
   Proponents, including environmental, business and
good-government groups, say the merger would allow the county to
get a handle on runaway growth and development and make possible
more efficient, centralized decision-making.
   ``The idea behind it is to create a more efficient provider of
services,'' said Paul Hahn, deputy executive director of a local
government commission appointed two years ago to study the issue.
   ``Right now, there is a lot of duplication of effort - two
police departments, two public works departments, a police and
sheriff's department. They don't always coordinate with each
other,'' he said.
   Foes of the plan include independent developers and those who
have led efforts in recent years to incorporate new cities in
fast-growing Sacramento County.
   Sacramento City Councilman Tom Chinn argues that the plan
``would add another 100 politicians to the county'' and probably
would lead to higher taxes.
   Creating a new city would force the removal of about 125
California Highway Patrol officers from area roads, he said.
Highway officers are charged by law with patrolling state and
county highways, but not city streets.
   The merger would combine fire, law enforcement and planning
agencies and create a new 12-member Council of Supervisors - 11
members elected by district, plus the mayor.
   Twenty local town councils also would be created, each with five
elected members, with land-use powers over local projects.
   Exempted from the new government would be three of the county's
four current incorporated cities: Folsom with 26,000 people, Galt
with 7,500 and Isleton with 925.
   A streamlined merger would save about $20 million annually. The
county's current budget is about $1 billion; the city's is about a
third of that.
   Hahn, citing a hired consultant's report, said the merger could
result in the loss of about 400 of 7,000 full-time city-county
positions. But the losses would occur through attrition,not by
layoffs, during the first two to three years, he said.

   Tempers flared as tourists stranded on
North Carolina's Outer Banks by a bridge collapse waited in a
600-car backup for ferry rides back to the mainland.
   By late this morning, about 275 cars were left.
   Volunteers eased the tension early today by handing out snacks
and blankets to motorists waiting in the dark in 40-degree weather.
   ``People in the community have brought God knows how many
sandwiches, and coffee and spiced tea and such,'' said Julia
O'Neal, who works in the Ocracoke Island ferry office. ``It means a
lot when you've got something hot in your hand.''
   Lines which had stretched up to six miles Sunday from the
jumping off point on Ocracoke Island dwindled to 275 cars today.
Officials expected to empty Ocracoke of outbound traffic late
today.
   While tourists groused about long lines, some natives complained
that visitors were using up gasoline and other supplies.
   Relief efforts got into full swing Sunday, with the National
Guard flying in 1,500 meals. Other emergency supplies, including
fuel, water, blankets and food, were brought onto Hatteras Island,
which has 5,000 permanent residents.
   Hatteras and Ocracoke islands were cut off from the mainland
Friday when a dredge, dragging an anchor in heavy winds and waves,
rammed the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge over Oregon Inlet. A 370-foot
section of the 2{-mile span collapsed. About 8,000 people live on
the two islands.
   State Sen. Marc Basnight said Sunday that the bridge may be
repaired in 45 working days. Officials earlier estimated the work
would take at least six months.
   Four ferries, capable of moving 150 cars every six hours, are
the only means off the two islands. People have had to take one
ferry for the mile trip to Ocracoke Island, then another 30 miles
to the mainland. The complete trip takes about 3{ hours.
   Some of those who rushed to the Ocracoke-bound ferries did not
realize they did not go straight to the mainland.
   ``How can we get to the governor about this?'' Dorothy L. Salmon
of Greensboro. ``They should have told us on Hatteras we were going
to be here all night. There's diabetics out there with no sweets.
There's babies with no blankets.''
   Robert Ashwell, a visitor from Virginia, was disgusted that so
many cars were allowed onto Ocracoke, considering the limited
capacity of the ferries.
   ``It doesn't take upper-level math to figure this out,'' he
said.
   Generators were hooked up Sunday on Hatteras, providing limited
electricity to three island towns. The accident also knocked out
telephone service.
   Officials encouraged those waiting in line to return to the
Hatteras shelter, which has power from a generator, hot food and
Red Cross workers.
   About 1,000 Hatteras residents held a meeting Sunday. One
speaker was frustrated by vacationers wanting precious gasoline to
run four-wheel-drive vehicles on the beach. His request that
tourists get off the island was met with applause.
   Ted S. Midgett, co-owner of the Midgett Bros. Service Station in
Hatteras Village, said tourists were limited to $10 worth of
gasoline at his pumps. Still, he expected to run out shortly and
did not know when or how his next shipment would arrive.
   Residents of the tourism-dependent islands also worried about
the exodus.
   R. Stewart Couch, general manager of Hatteras Realty, said
residents really wanted the tourists gone only until things were
back to normal. ``We need to get our house in order,'' he said.
``Then we will invite them back.''

   A food bank salvaged at least a ton of frozen
catfish that spilled after a refrigerated truck crashed.
   ``It's a blessing,'' said Joyce Rothermel, executive director of
the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. ``Donations that are
high in protein, like fish, are very rare.''
   The driver, Tim Cardwell, 28, of Marianna, Ark., told police his
foot slipped off the brake pedal Sunday and hit the accelerator.
The truck slammed into a wall of an overpass above Point State
Park.
   The cab came to rest beside the wall, but the truneration of those
born in Cuba but raised
for the most part in the United States. Others include pop music
star Gloria Estefan, actor Steven Bauer, Oakland A's slugger Jose
Canseco, Miami Mayor Suarez, Florida Democratic Party chairman
Simon Ferro and Marty Urra, head of the South Florida AFL-CIO.
   The young Cuban-Americans sometimes call themselves ``yucas.''
That stands for Young Upscale Cuban-Americans and is a takeoff on
the potato-like yucca that is a staple of Cuban diets.
   They often move in and out of mainstream American life and
personal lives that emphasize their native culture. They usually
describe themselves as patriotic toward both Cuba and the United
States.
   State Sen. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, 36, spends much of his day
speaking English in the Legislature or his Coconut Grove law firm,
but tries to speak only Spanish at home to his children, ages 5 and
7.
   Many afternoons find him slipping away at lunchtime to meet one
or more of his three brothers - they include a banker, a state
representative and the weekend anchor on a leading English-language
television station - at La Hacienda restaurant for the day's
special, always with fried bananas and black beans over rice.
   ``I never actually separated being a Cuban-American from being
American,'' Diaz-Balart says. ``I was always proud of my roots,
proud of Cuba. And I was always proud of the United States, the
land of freedom and hope.''
   Diaz-Balart's first name evinces the affinity Cubans long have
had for the United States, which intervened in the Cuba's war for
independence that exiles smilingly note is called ``the
Spanish-American War'' in U.S. history.
   He is eager to help rebuild a Cuba he says has been devastated
by his uncle. Castro was married to Diaz-Balart's aunt and Castro's
son, Fidelito, is a first cousin.
   ``Diaz-Balart says very few Cubans would move back to Cuba
permanently after three decades here. However, many will be
involved in a post-Castro Cuba.
   ``There's going to be a lot of duality,'' Suarez says, with Cuba
only 90 miles from Florida's southern tip. ``There will be people
with homes in both places, investments in both places ... trade,
tourism. A lot of people are going to feel very comfortable here
but also want to spend part of the time there.''
   Castro has vowed to maintain his system in Cuba, but excitement
over his potential downfall is as high here as perhaps anytime
since before the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.
   Around Miami there is a new sign: ``Christmas in Cuba.''

   President Bush is expected in Germany
sometime before Nov. 19 but plans for a visit by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev are still up in the air, the government said
Monday.
   Government spokesman Norbert Schaefer said it had originally
been ``assumed'' that Gorbachev would visit Germany Nov. 4-6.
   He said, however, ``there is still no confirmation by the Soviet
side.''
   Carrying out complex plans for a Gorbachev visit could be
difficult at this late date, but there were no indications the trip
might be called off.
   Schaefer said Bush is expected in Germany sometime before the
Nov. 19-21 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is to be held in Paris.
   Schaefer said it would be a ``short, private visit'' and would
likely take place at Chancellor Helmut Kohl's home in Oggersheim,
and not in Bonn.

   Sailors aboard U.S. ships and submarines in
the Persian Gulf are shooting for college credits in the midst of
the military standoff, poring over textbooks and videotapes in the
middle of the night while keeping an eye on Iraq,
   Nearly 200 combat-ready officers and sailors aboard at least
five surface ships and several submarines are enrolled in courses
ranging from English and economics to physics and psychology.
   For most, it's their first college experience.
   Sailors have special work areas aboard the ships where they
operate computer videos they can use for course tutors, for
``homework'' assignments with feedback and for quizzes to test
comprehension.
   Textbooks and study guides are used, too. Optional materials
include audiocassettes and anthologies.
   ``The key thing is that when there are fairly stressful
operational kinds of requirements - such as the gulf, where the
available free time is likely to be limited to bits and pieces
throughout the day - it works very well,'' said Bruce Wilburn,
president of Middlesex Research Center, which developed the
software for the program.
   ``We find that the most popular time to study is from midnight
to 4 a.m.,'' he said. ``They all stand watches and that is the
watch with the least going on.''
   College credits can be earned at George Washington University in
the nation's capital and the University of Oklahoma in Norman,
Okla., which helped develop the curriculum along with Coastline
Community College in California.
   Wilburn said the program has produced outstanding results in
other ombat-ready situations, and expectations are high for the
sailors in the gulf.
   George Washington University professor Michael Bradley, who
helped develop the economics course, said, ``I think on the average
these people are more motivated because they are self selected.''
   ``They only take this because they want to, whereas a typical
college freshman takes it because its required or parents told them
they had to take economics.''
   Bradley said the materials are similar to those used in regular
classes ``with the exception that these are just a little bit more
real world oriented.''
   For example, Bradley said an economics video on ``supply and
demand'' may include interviews with farmers or others as
illustrations.
   Classes aboard ship begin when the sailors leave port. With most
ships deployed for six-month intervals, Navy personnel are able to
take classes for two semesters.
   ``On submarines, when the hatch closes the class starts and when
they open the hatches, the sailors should be done,'' said Wilburn.
   Fifty percent of those taking telecourses are sailors ages 19 to
20 who have been in the Navy for one to two years. The other 50
percent primarily are career Navy officers and upper-level enlisted
men.
   The Annenberg-CPB program, created by the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting with a gift in 1981 from the Annenberg School of
Communications, has five telecourses used by the Navy. They are
``Economics U$A, The New Literacy, The Write Course, Mechanical
Universe and Planet Earth.
   Other groups offer about 25 other college courses, including
English, mathematics - including trigonometry, pre-calculus and
calculus - physics, geography, political science, Spanish,
economics, business and history. Psychology is the most popular
course, said Wilburn.
   The sailors pay for the books, while the Navy provides the
equipment and software and pays the school fees that range from
under $200 per semester to as much as $500.
   When the program first began, Wilburn said the completion rate
was around 50 percent. Officials have since tightened eligibility
requirements and now estimate the courses have an 81 percent
completion rate.
   The average grade is ``C plus,'' he said.
   ``These courses are not easy and require a lot of time and
effort to complete. The key to their success has been the
commitment of each ship's highest officers to the value of a
college education for his personnel,'' said Annenberg director Mara
Mayor.
   Since 1987, more than 4,000 enlisted U.S. Naval personnel on as
many as 70 surface ships, aircraft carriers, and submarines have
enrolled in telecourses. Courses currently are available on more
than 220 U.S. Navy ship deployments out of four Atlantic Coast
ports, including Norfolk, Va.; Charleston, S.C.; Groton, Conn. and
Kings Bay, Ga.

   The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame today announced
10 inductees, including the Byrds, Ike and Tina Turner and Wilson
Pickett.
   They will be inducted Jan. 16 in New York, where the first five
induction ceremonies have been held. More than $40 million has been
raised for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland
but construction has not begun.
   The inductees in the artists category are:
   - La Vern Baker, best known for a string of pop and rhythm and
blues hits in the 1950s and 1960s.
   - The Byrds, a popular group of the 1960s that had such hits as
`Mr. Tambourine Man'' and ``Eight Miles High.''
   - John Lee Hooker, an influential guitarist.
   - The Impressions, whose songs included ``Gypsy Woman'' and
``People Get Ready.''
   - Wilson Pickett, who recorded ``In the Midnight Hour.''
   - Jimmy Reed, whose song ``Baby What You Want Me to Do,'' was
recorded by Elvis Presley.
   - Ike and Tina Turner, best remembered for the remake of ``Proud
Mary.''
   In the early-influences category, the single inductee is Howlin'
Wolf, who died in 1976. Wolf wrote ``Sitting on Top of the World,''
popularized by the group Cream.
   Producers Dave Bartholomew and Ralph Bass will be inducted in
the non-performing category.
   Bartholomew headed the New Orleans Rhythm and Blues Explosion in
the 1950s. He discovered Fats Domino and co-wrote many of his hits.
Bass discovered James Brown and helped to start the Platters on
their career.

   No one's betting the farm on
Republican Rep. Arlan Stangeland's political career. Not after the
budget problems in Washington and the questions about his
late-night phone calls to a Virginia woman.
   Stangeland, a burly 60-year-old ex-farmer, is asking voters for
a seventh full term against a backdrop of scandal, anti-incumbent
fervor, Depression-era grain prices and shrinking federal farm
subsidies.
   But the GOP congressman has been a study in resilience. And his
challenger, accountant Collin Peterson, is short on money, disliked
by many in his own Democratic party and has lost to Stangeland
twice before.
   ``This is a race that you won't know the outcome until the votes
are counted,'' Stangeland said.
   Polls show the race is a dead heat even though Stangeland won
re-election two years ago by a reasonably comfortable majority - 55
percent.
   That was before jokes about Stangeland started making the rounds
of 7th District coffee shops.
   The St. Cloud Times reported in January that Stangeland used his
congressional credit card to pay for 428 long-distance calls to and
from a Virginia woman's home. Some of the calls were made early in
the morning and late at night.
   Some people took to calling Stangeland ``Adam.'' The Virginia
woman's first name is Eve.
   Stangeland, a married father of seven who campaigns as a
protector of family values, denied any impropriety.
   But Democratic leaders filed a complaint with the House ethics
committee and the issue dogs the campaign.
   And now Stangeland has an added worry: Voters turned off by the
state's gubernatorial campaign may stay away from the polls.
   Republican Jon Grunseth was running neck and neck with Gov. Rudy
Perpich until allegations surfaced that he swam nude with some
teen-age girls nine years ago. Grunseth dropped out of the race on
Sunday and the state GOP is in a tumult about picking a successor
to challenge Perpich.
   ``A light voter turnout ... will hurt,'' Stangeland said.
   Peterson, 46, says he has no plans to raise the issue of
Stangeland's late-night phone calls. He has problems of his own
stemming from his previous races for Stangeland's seat.
   Peterson lost the 1986 election by 121 votes, but proclaimed
himself congressman-elect, demanded a recount, prepared to open a
temporary office in Washington and went through freshman
orientation.
   After the six-week recount was completed, Stangeland's victory
stood.
   Peterson irked his party again in 1988 when he announced he
would challenge the endorsed candidate.
   ``You don't run three times without causing some problems,''
Peterson said. ``Somebody's always going to be unhappy with you.''
   For 13 years, Stangeland has had solid support from area
farmers, who have made the fertile Red River Valley into one of the
most prosperous agricultural regions in the country.
   But Peterson has pounded away at Stangeland's poor environmental
record and hopes to take advantage of farm angst over depressed
wheat prices and the congressional budget cuts.
   The deficit-reduction package assembled by Congress reduces farm
spending by 25 percent over the next five years. The price of wheat
already is down a dollar a bushel this fall, while the black Red
River Valley soil is bone dry after three years of drought.
   Peterson favors a less marke-oriented farm policy that would
count on increased export subsidies and higher price supports.
   Stangeland has devoted much of his legislative energy to
protecting the government's sugar and dairy programs and he hopes
to retain strong support from farmers despite the coming cutbacks
in the farm payments.

<HEAD>Underdog Democrat Seeks Boost From GOP Rival's Abortion Gaffe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB FICK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Ron Twilegar can thank his GOP
rival for helping reintroduce abortion as an issue in Idaho's
sleepy U.S. Senate race.
   Twilegar, the underdog in the race, began running ads critical
of Rep. Larry Craig's opposition to abortion after the congressman
gave a puzzling response in a debate two weeks ago.
   Craig seemed to change his position when asked if he would ask
his wife, Suzanne, to carry a pregnancy to term if it resulted from
rape or incest, even if she wanted to have an abortion.
   ``That would be a very, very tough choice,'' Craig replied. ``I
have said this is a personal issue. ... But I will tell you my wife
is my wife, but she is also an individual, and I have never blocked
her decisions or her right to make decisions. I think that is very
important for her and her ability to handle it.''
   Twilegar, who entered the race to give voters a pro-choice
option, applauded Craig for what he called ``a change of his mind
for the better.''
   ``So how about it, Congressman Craig,'' Twilegar asked. ``Is
Suzanne Craig the only woman in America who gets a choice?''
   Right to Life leaders expressed immediate alarm at Craig's
comments, wanting to know ``what in the world he's talking about,''
and Craig quickly initiated damage control.
   Three telephone conversations between Washington and Idaho
convinced anti-abortion leaders to issue a statement reaffirming
their support for Craig.
   The congressman blamed ``headline writers'' for the controversy
and refused to elaborate on a statement saying he had not changed
his position.
   Craig and Twilegar are vying for the Senate seat being vacated
by GOP Sen. James McClure, who is retiring.
   The debate flap prompted Twilegar to start airing TV ads
stressing the congressman's position on abortion.
   ``We didn't put abortion back into the news and the voters'
minds,'' said Twilegar campaign manager Richard Callow.
``Congressman Craig did. He made them think, and we're reminding
them that they do.''
   Twilegar's ad accuses Craig of wanting to return American women
to the days of illegal, life-threatening back-alley abortions. It
shows a woman walking toward an alley door, followed by a conveyor
belt of coat hangers.
   However, it appears the ad may have generated more opposition
than support for Twilegar among Idaho voters.
   Abortion put Idaho in the national spotlight last March when
state lawmakers approved what would have been the nation's most
restrictive state abortion law. The measure was vetoed by
Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus.
   Within a few weeks, the issue had cooled and abortion became a
relatively minor factor in the 1990 campaign.
   Twilegar's abortion ad was among several his campaign had
completed just prior to the debate but he hadn't decided which ones
the cash-short campaign would put on the air.
   ``Congressman Craig's debate performance made our decision very
easy,'' Callow said. ``What we're concentrating on is the
extremism. ... We'll let the force of Craig's denial that he has
changed his mind serve as the power for our ad.''

   A senior Saudi envoy's visit to Iran
indicates Tehran and Riyadh may be close to re-establishing ties
cut when hundreds of Iranian pilgrims were slain in Mecca in 1988,
Tehran sources said Monday.
   The Saudi deputy foreign minister's arrival Friday, in the first
Saudi official visit since ties were severed, caps weeks of efforts
by Riyad to narrow the rift with Iran, the sources said.
   The Saudis cut their ties with Iran in the closing stages of the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, in which they bankrolled Baghdad's war
effort.
   Now they are in a confrontation with Baghdad over Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. The invasion Aug. 2 has accelerated efforts by
both Saudi and Iranian moderates to end the rift.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani wants to end his country's
isolation by improving ties the West and his Arab neighbors. His
hard-line opponents oppose that but lately have been unable to
change Rafsanjani's policies.
   Riyadh, seeking to cement the coalition against Iraq, has in
recent weeks been wooing Iran, urging it to tone down its
anti-Saudi rhetoric.
   Last month, Iran resumed ties with Britain after an 18-month
break, despite objections by the anti-Western hardliners.
   Iran's state radio and television, run by Rafsanjani's brother,
Mohammed Hashemi, have given the visit of the Saudi envoy,
Abdul-Rahman Mansuri, little coverage.
   But the Farsi-language Jomhuri Islami daily, close to the
hard-line opposition, asked Monday: ``What is Saudi Arabia's
purpose in its recent move and what is it after?''
   Jomhuri Islami's commentary was carried by Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency and was monitored in Nicosia.
   The daily stressed Riyadh would have to meet two conditions
before a resumption of diplomatic relations - remove the
U.S.-dominated multinational force and allow Iranian pilgrims to
stage political rallies at Moslem shrines in Saudi Arabia.
   The Saudis requested the multinational force to defend the
kingdom after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The presence of the Western
forces in Saudi Arabia, the paper said, ``is similar to the
military occupation of Kuwait by Iraq, and is even worse.''
   The daily also demanded that Iranian Moslems on the annual
pilgrimage to the Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest
shrines, be allowed to stage political demonstrations.
   The Iranians have insisted that staging protests demonstrating
``antipathy towards pagans,'' is a cornerstone of the hajj, or
pilgrimage. The Saudis, who consider the pilgrimage a purely
religious rite, have banned political demonstrations.
   Riyadh's decision to sever ties with Tehran came after more than
400 pilgrims, most of them Iranians, were killed in a clash in 1988
with Saudi security forces.
   The Saudis say the trouble was instigated by the Iranians, and
cut off ties with Tehran, citing terrorism and subversion.
   Tehran accused the Saudis of deliberately killing Iranian
pilgrims.

<HEAD>Moscow Mayor Appeals for Japanese Loans to Support Perestroika</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By S.L. BACHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov appealed Monday for
Japanese loans to help the Soviet capital convert its state
businesses into private enterprises.
   Moscow plans to begin the shift to private ownership by allowing
its residents to own their own homes, but the mayor said foreign
loans would be used mostly to support ``parts of the economy
directly governed by the Moscow city government,'' such as the
retail distribution system.
   Only shops deemed healthy enough to succeed in repaying the
loans would receive the aid, said Popov, a radical economist who
quit the Communist Party in July. He spoke at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Japan.
   Popov said the economic reform plan adopted this month by the
Soviet legislature would fail, threatening the future of democratic
forces in the Soviet Union.
   The plan calls for such steps as encouraging small private
business and ending many state monopolies.
   Popov predicted the Soviet leadership would adopt more radical
free market measures if the plan does not take hold within a few
months. He said he might ``passively resist'' the conservative
restructuring program and carry out a more radical economic program
in his city.
   He said he would not ask foreigners to extend loans directly to
his city. Loans should go through the central government, but with
their recipients and use clearly specified, he said.
   Popov joined others in the Soviet Union in calling for Japan to
extend economic aid before resolving the issue of several disputed
islands.
   The group of islands stretching north from Hokkaido was seized
by Soviet troops in the final days of World War II. The dispute has
kept Tokyo and Moscow from signing a peace treaty and has curtailed
Japanese investment in the Soviet Union.
   ``As far as I know, the Russian federation is ready to begin
negotiations,'' he said.
   Earlier this month, Japanese media reported that a Soviet
official suggested to a senior Japanese politician that Moscow
might return two islands. Moscow later denied the story.
   Popov said he is in Japan on vacation, but has met with Tokyo
government officials to discuss establishing a sister city
relationship.

   Keith Thomlinson is used to getting
pretty decent tips as a bartender at a restaurant near the Newport
beaches, but it took a little luck to earn a $25,000 gratuity.
   Russell Clark, a frequent patron at the Greenhouse Inn and
Restaurant just off Newport's First Beach, left Thomlinson an
instant lottery ticket as a tip Wednesday.
   When Thomlinson finally got around to scratching off the numbers
on the instant ``Baseball'' game, he discovered he had won the
$25,000 grand prize. After about $5,000 in federal taxes and $1,200
for the state, he carried home nearly $19,000.
   ``It sat there for almost two days until I scrubbed it off,''
Thomlinson said Monday. ``I was just shocked.''
   Thomlinson, 42, shared his good fortune. He gave $1,800 to Clark
and $5,000 to his parents, Raymond and Marguerite of Detroit.
   ``She's going to pay bills,'' Thomlinson said of his mother.
``Dad's retired. They don't have a real big pension.''
   Clark said he probably would use his $1,800 to buy more lottery
tickets. He said he likes to leave more than just a cash tip at
restuarants, and often gives candy, flowers or lottery tickets.
``It's just something I do,'' he said.
   But Clark, 60, does have some second thoughts.

   An Iraqi Airways jetliner carrying more than 260 French citizens
left Baghdad for Paris today on a flight that ended their grueling
hostage ordeal.
   At nearly the same time, the U.N. Security Council
overwhelmingly approved a resolution demanding that Iraq make
reparations for the suffering that has occurred as a result of its
invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
   The resolution holds Iraq liable for human rights abuses, war
damages and economic losses caused by its military aggression.
   The measure also demands that Baghdad allow food, water and
other supplies to be sent into the Western diplomatic missions in
Kuwait, which are besieged by Iraqi guards. Thirteen nations voted
for the resolution in New York, the 10th since the invasion on Aug.
2. Cuba and Yemen abstained.
   Regarding the hostages, the French Foreign Ministry said in
Paris that the Boeing 747 departed Baghdad at about 12:30 p.m. EST
and would be in the French capital by midnight local time if all
went smoothly.
   The ministry also said French diplomats had been ordered to pull
out of their embassy in Kuwait, where they had endured siege-like
conditions for weeks. The seven diplomats were aboard the jetliner
when it flew into Baghdad from Kuwait with more than 50 freed
hostages. That group was joined by about 210 French citizens
waiting at the Baghdad airport.
   The plane also carried nine Greeks, four Britons, two Filipinos,
one German and one Spanish citizen freed by Iraq, according to a
witness at the airport.
   More than 60 French citizens believed to be in Iraq and Kuwait
were not aboard the plane. Western diplomats said some may have
left on their own and others chose to stay behind.
   ``I can say now that all French citizens who wanted to go home
have gone home,'' French charge d'affaires Andre Janier said in
Baghdad.
   Daniel Bernard, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, confirmed France
will honor Iraq's demand to fill the plane with a cargo of medicine
for the return flight.
   Medicine is excluded from the U.N. embargo of Iraq and occupied
Kuwait.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France cautioned against
celebration as long as hundreds of Westerners remain captive in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``I express the joy of all the French people to those coming
home,'' Mitterrand said. ``But we will rejoice fully only when the
other hostages can return to their own countries.''
   Mitterrand spoke at a news conference outside Paris with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev after the signing of a Franco-Soviet
cooperation treaty.
   Gorbachev said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should not to
expect a split in the international alliance opposed to Iraq's Aug.
2 seizure of Kuwait.
   ``We must not permit the Iraqi regime to hope there will be a
division, a weakening of positions,'' Gorbachev said. He called
Iraq's use of hostages ``amoral.''
   The Soviet leader urged sanctions against Iraq be stepped up and
said the time was right for Arab nations to embark on a new
initiative to resolve the crisis, possibly under Saudi leadership.
   ``It seems to me that the Iraqis could be ready for this,''
Gorbachev said. ``If we were to have an inter-Arab meeting, this
would be the quickest way to a settlement.''
   Gorbachev said he had received a telegram from his envoy,
Yevgeny Primakov, indicating after a visit to Baghdad and a meeting
with Saddam that there were some shifts in Saddam's positions. The
Soviet leader did not elaborate. Earlier, the Soviet foreign
minister said Primakov's talks were cause for ``little reason for
optimism.''
   Saddam told Cable News Network today that he had a
``wide-ranging, deep and very useful'' dialogue with Primakov. The
Iraqi president said it would be incorrect to assume nothing was
accomplished in his talks with Primakov.
   Oil prices shot up more than $1 per barrel in New York today
because of trader's concern that Primakov had made little progress.
Some traders said, however, that they were waiting to hear Saddam's
remarks on CNN.
   Saddam is holding hundreds of foreigners as ``human shields'' at
strategic sites in Iraq to deter possible attack. Although he has
allowed selected groups of the thousands of foreigners to leave,
many others are being held.
   European Community leaders meeting in Rome pledged not to send
representatives to try to win freedom for hostages held in Iraq and
occupied Kuwait, reasoning that to do so would only support
Saddam's efforts to try to divide the alliance arrayed against him.
   The decision followed a trip to Baghdad by former British Prime
Minister Edward Heath, who helped secure the release of more than
30 British hostages.
   France, the United States and Britain have been the only Western
countries to maintain embassies in Kuwait since Iraq overran the
emirate. In August, Iraq cut off water and electricity to all
embassies that defied its orders to close.
   France had been considering withdrawing its diplomats from
Kuwait for several weeks because of the extremely arduous living
conditions under Iraqi occupation. It had refrained from doing so
to allow the diplomats to support the French hostages in Kuwait.

<HEAD>New Outbreak of Faction Fighting, Terror Charges Against ANC
Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Twenty-six blacks were killed
in weekend factional fighting that erupted after a month of
relative calm in black areas, police said Monday.
   Also, nine African National Congress members were charged with
terrorism and the illegal possession of weapons in a case that
could further strain relations between the government and the black
opposition movement.
   One of the nine, Mac Maharaj, is on the ANC's national executive
committee and also is a top official in the closely allied South
African Communist Party.
   The nine, all in detention since July, were not asked to plead
at the Durban Regional Court. They have accused police of torture
and threatening them with death.
   The worst weekend violence was in the Soweto township outside
Johannesburg, where 16 people were killed and 33 wounded in a spate
of attacks Sunday night, said police Col. Tienie Halgryn.
   Police said the violence may have been in revenge for attacks
Saturday in Soweto on supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party. One
man was killed and two were injured.
   Fighting between Zulu supporters of Inkatha other blacks tied to
the ANC has claimed almost 800 lives in the Johannesburg area
during August and September. There have been only sporadic
incidents this month.
   Police said they did not know if any of the dead and wounded
were connected to the ANC. Halgryn said it appeared gunmen had gone
on a random revenge spree after the Inkatha supporters were
attacked.
   Police said Monday an unidentified man, allegedly a member of
the ANC youth wing, had been arrested in the killing of the Inkatha
supporter.
   The killings came after thousands of Inkatha supporters, many
carrying spears, clubs and shields, paraded through central
Johannesburg on Saturday. The marchers presented a petition to
police accusing security forces of working against Inkatha. The ANC
has accused police of assisting Inkatha.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose the apartheid system of racial
segregation, but are divided over tactics and plans for a future
South Africa.
   The white-led government and the ANC have been holding periodic
peace talks since May, but both sides have been accusing one other
of acting in bad faith.
   Many of the charges and counter-charges have focused on the
township violence and the detention of ANC members such as Maharaj.
   Police also said Monday that weekend faction fighting between
rival Xhosas and Sothos at a gold mine in the Orange Free State
left nine workers dead and 42 injured.
   The fighting broke out at a workers hostel Saturday night at
Rand Mines' Harmony Gold Mine in Virginia, 160 miles southwest of
Johannesburg, and continued into Sunday, the company said.
   The mine was reported quiet Monday as management officials
talked to the rival groups. Police said mine officials did not know
what sparked the fighting.

   A series of tropical storms has
seriously damaged ancient palaces and temples in Hue, the former
imperial capital of Vietnam, the official Vietnam News Agency
reported.
   Another report by the news agency said Monday that
archaeologists had discovered a site containing ancient stone
carvings in the northern province of Hoang Lien Son. It was the
first time Vietnamese archaeologists had come across a site of such
significance, it said.
   The carvings included pastoral scenes and human figures and bore
traces of ancient writing in the form of pictographs, according to
the report.
   In Hue, the storms blew the roofs off palaces and temples, said
a report dated Wednesday and seen in Bangkok on Monday. It said the
Noon Gate, the Thai Hoa Court hall, the Thai and The temples, the
Cien Tho Palace, and royal tombs were damaged.
   It also said about two dozen bridges in the temple complex were
destroyed or damaged.
   Hue, an ancient town of temples and palaces, was rebuilt by the
emperor Gia Long in the 19th century to replicate the Forbidden
City in Beijing, where his Chinese patron ruled.
   The city was heavily damaged by artillery and air attacks during
the Vietnam War.

   The oldest newspaper in the country,
El Dia, published an edition of only eight pages Monday and told
readers it is on the verge of collapse.
   The 104-year-old paper began to slide economically a decade ago
when the military government in power then ruled it must pay the
same taxes as other businesses.
   Recently, El Dia has suffered labor problems. Last month, it was
shut down four days by a strike.
   ``We don't know how much longer'' the 15,000-circulation paper
will continue to publish, an article stated. ``Today we find
ourselves on the verge of collapse.''
   Many Uruguayan papers are hurting from the nation's economic
problems, but El Dia, firmly tied to the centrist Colorado Party,
seems to be hit the hardest.
   El Dia was founded by the man who would twice be elected
president and become one Uruguay's best-known and best-loved
politicians, Jose Batlle y Ordonez.

Monday.
   Richard Grant, publicist for Miss Martin's son, actor Larry

   Miss Martin became a star of New York theater with her 1938
appearance in the musical ``Leave It to Me.'' She also played nurse
Nellie Forbush in ``South Pacific'' and Maria in a Broadway version
of ``The Sound of Music.''
   She first played Peter Pan on Broadway in 1954.
   Miss Martin was seriously injured in a 1982 taxi-van collision

<HEAD>Conference Considers Ban on Toxic Ocean Dumping; US Wants More
Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates from more than 60 nations met Monday to
debate a proposed global ban on the ocean dumping of toxic
industrial waste. But the United States intends to seek further
study before agreeing to a ban.
   The proposal from Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden
calls for industrial dumping at sea to be phased by out 1995.
   It will be debated Tuesday by the nations at the meeting,
signatories to the London Dumping Convention, or LDC. The
20-year-old convention regulates the hauling of industrial waste to
sea on ships.
   The so-called Nordic proposal calls for such dumping to be
stopped and to do so without increasing pollution to other parts of
the environment and without exporting waste to other countries that
have not signed the treaty.
   The proposal asks signatory nations to encourage and promote
cleaner industrial processes, recycling, the treatment of waste on
land and more research and development on alternative and
environmentally sound means of waste disposal.
   The five-day London meeting will be closely watched by
governments, industry and environmentalists because the group is
the only international body dealing with marine pollution.
   If it can reach consensus on the current agenda, it will bode
well for future negotations on broader, more complex marine issues
such as land-based pollution of the sea.
   Most regulation of ocean pollution is carried out by individual
nations or by regional groups.
   As the problem of seaborne pollution has increased, so have
calls for a coordinated global response. Delegates will consider
whether to expand the scope of the current treaty by beginning work
on a new global convention on marine pollution.
   About 80 percent of ocean pollution is generated on land, with
10 percent coming from industrial waste disposal and the rest
thrown or discharged from ships.
   The leader of the U.S. delegation, Robert Reinstein, said more
study was needed before the United States could support the ban.
Reinstein is deputy assistant secretary of state for environment,
health and natural resources.
   ``We just want to look at all the options and assess them on
their merits,'' he said.
   Britain, Ireland, Canada, Japan, France and Switzerland also
have expressed reservations about the ban.
   Environmentalists accuse the United States of foot dragging and
of taking a position in international negotiations contrary to U.S.
domestic law.
   In 1988, Congress passed the Ocean Dumping Ban Act prohibiting
the ocean disposal of any industrial or municipal waste. The
legislation also forbade ocean-based incineration and set deadlines
for a number of East Coast cities to stop dumping municipal sewage.
   The U.S. law is one of strictest in the world on ocean dumping
of toxic waste.
   ``The State Department idea seems to be to keep the options open
for future dumping in case domestic law can one day be changed,''
said Clifton Curtis, an observer at the meeting from the Glands,
Switzerland-based International Union for the Conservation of
Nature. He spoke before the conference opened.
   Reinstein defended the decision to call for more study.
   ``Our general postion on several aspects of waste disposal is
that we want a good scientific basis ... for the decisions we take,
not as a way of delaying decisions on an environmental threat, but
just as a general principle.''

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas claimed Monday
they had seized a district capital in western Cambodia.
   The guerrillas overran the district seat of Svay Leu in Siem
Reap province on Friday, the guerrilla radio said.
   The guerrilla faction of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, which is
allied with the Khmer Rouge, said Friday its forces began attacking
Svay Leu two days earlier and killed 11 government troops.
   Vietnam installed the Phnom Penh government after invading
Cambodia in 1978 and ousting the Khmer Rouge. Thailand backs the
guerrillas and is the main conduit for the arms reaching them.
   The Khmer Rouge is the largest of the guerrilla factions. It was
responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
during its 3{-year rule starting in 1975.
   According to Western intelligence sources and guerrilla
commanders, the Khmer Rouge was recently supplied with 24 tanks by
its main backer, China, and planned to use them in attacks on Siem
Reap.
   The radio did not say if tanks were used at Svay Leu.
   The capital of Siem Reap province, also called Siem Reap, is
some 150 miles northwest of the national capital, Phnom Penh.
   Recent efforts to end the war have failed because the factions
have been unable to agree on the leadership of a council intended
to represent the country's sovereignty under a U.N. peace plan.
   In Bangkok on Monday, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan
discussed the war with Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach.

   First lady Barbara Bush on Monday came to

   While Hatfield was speaking, two hecklers were hustled out of
the Hilton Hotel ballroom by security guards.
   The protesters, who shouted about homosexual rights, were
charged with trespass and one was charged with disorderly conduct,
said police spokesman Dave Simpson.
   Mrs. Bush urged more than 1,100 people who attended the
$100-a-plate breakfast to do whatever they could to ensure that
Hatfield is elected to a fifth term.
   ``Make that extra phone call, ring that extra doorbell and stuff

   The first lady said Hatfield, as the ranking Republican on the
Senate Appropriations Committee, has helped bring millions of
federal dollars to Oregon for such projects as the Hatfield Marine
Science Center at Newport.
   The Republican senator is locked in a tight race against
Democrat Harry Lonsdale, a Bend businessman who has attacked
Hatfield as a Washington insider who's beholden to special

<HEAD>AIDS Babies Experiments Halted After WHO Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Health Ministry has halted
controversial experiments being conducted on 83 babies infected
with the AIDS virus, hospital officials said Monday.
   The decision followed an investigation by a commission from the
World Health Organization, which visited last week to look into the
research conducted by a five-man British team.
   The team, led by David Hughes, had been administering periodic
injections of an experimental AIDS drug called FLV23/a to the
patients at Bucharest's Colentina Hospital since September, with
Health Ministry approval.
   Although the WHO commission's conclusions were not made public,
they were presented to the Health Ministry at the end of last week
and the ministry decided to halt the experiments, the officials
said. They asked not to be named.
   Word that the experiment had been halted was preceded by a
Health Ministry statement.
   ``The data from the clinical trial ... are not sufficient to
determine the safety or efficacy of FLV23/a,'' the statement said.
   The hospital officials said the next series of injections,
scheduled for Tuesday, would not be administered. This was
confirmed by British volunteers also working at the hospital.
   No comment was available from Hughes or members of his team.
   Sice the December revolution that ousted Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, some 800 babies have been diagnosed nationwide
as having the disease that kills by attacking the body's immune
system.
   Ceausescu was obsessed with increasing Romania's population of
23 million and forbade abortions and birth control. Tens of
thousands of mostly unwanted babies were left at state
institutions, where some contracted AIDS through blood
transfusions.
   Newborns were often given blood transfusions in Romania in the
belief it would make them stronger. Needles were in short supply
and routinely used hundreds of times.
   Some of the mothers whose babies were undergoing the experiments
said Monday they opposed stopping them.
   ``I want the experiments to continue,'' Daniela Dumitrescu said
in an interview. ``My child is feeling well, he has stopped
vomiting and has gained weight.''
   Doctors at the hospital said that none of the babies had died
since the beginning of the injections, while several died before.
   British Embassy sources said the British Foreign Office sent
Romanian authorities a telex last month warning them against
Hughes.
   The sources said Hughes, who arrived in Romania some five months
ago, was ordered by the Malawi authorities to leave that country
after conducting similar experiments there.
   They suggested that Hughes, who is not a medical doctor, had
been seeking Romanian approval for his drug, which would have made
it easier to sell internationally.
   After suspending the treatment in September, the Romanian Drug
Commission decided to approve it again earlier this month despite
the warnings.

<HEAD>Baker Warns Iraq on Use of Chemical, Biological Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today Iraq would suffer ``the most severe consequences'' if
President Saddam Hussein decides to use chemical or biological
weapons.
   Baker said said while the United States is exhausting every
diplomatic avenue to achieve a peaceful solution, no option has
been exluded.
   ``Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a possible use of force
if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait,'' Baker said.
   ``Saddam Hussein's way is not the way of peace. His is a
prescription for war. And I will say this bluntly: If his way of
doing business prevails, there will be no hope of peace in the
area,'' Baker said.
   His remarks were prepared for delivery to the Los Angeles World
Affairs Council.
   He said U.S. military forces have been sent to the Persian Gulf
region to provide an ``effective and decisive military response''
if the situation warrants it.
   ``Saddam Hussein must realize there is a limit to the
international community's patience. He must also realize that
should he use chemical or biological weapons, there will be the
most severe consequences,'' Baker said.
   Baker also said that conflicts in the Middle East have profound
consequences far beyond that region.
   ``There can be no hope of resolving other problems in the region
unless peaceful change becomes the wave of the future in the Middle
East and the gulf,'' he said.

   These, and some more commonplace suggestions, are among ways the

   In the meantime, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry has adopted guidelines that encourage stores to reduce the
hours they stay open and suggest that homes and offices be no
warmer than 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The ministry also advised residents to drive less, and said they
could save gasoline by avoiding quick stops and starts. Carry maps,
the ministry urged, and avoid getting lost.
   In Japan, the nightly bath is an institution, with a large tub
filled to the brim and used in turn by the whole family. The
ministry's conservation guidelines advise Japanese to jump into the
tub shortly after drawing the water so it will have to be reheated
less often.

   President Bush said today he would not
hesitate to use force in the Persian Gulf if provoked. ``History is
replete with examples when the president had to take action''
without consulting Congress, he added.
   Bush said he would meet Tuesday with congressional leaders about
the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf, a deployment that
could expand while Congress is adjourned.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised the possibility last week
that up to 100,000 more American troops could be added to the U.S.
presence in the region. Some lawmakers have raised concerns about
dramatic changes being made in the U.S. deployment without their
input.
   ``I'm looking forward to having talks with members of the
leadership tomorrow,'' Bush told reporters. ``But history is
replete with examples when the president would have to take action.
I've done this in the past, and certainly - somebody mentioned
provocations - we'd have no hesitancy at all'' he said.
   Bush ordered U.S. forces into Panama last December when Congress
was out of town.
   Asked if he was trying to prepare the country for war, Bush
said, ``I'm just doing my job as president of the United States.
I'm not preparing anybody for anything.'' But he also said, ``I am
as determined as I ever have been that this aggression will not
stand.''
   ``We have a lot of troops there, they are well-trained and they
are highly motivated. That alone is sending a strong message to
Saddam Hussein,'' Bush said.

   Bush also described the infighting over the budget approved last
weekend as ``class warfare.''
   ``This class warfare, taxing the rich, is really an attack on
the working people of America,'' he said.
   Bush made appearances today on behalf of Sen. Pete Wilson, whose
neck-and-neck gubernatorial bid against Democrat Dianne Feinstein
is the Republican Party's top state priority in next week's
elections.
   Bush has visited the state several times to stump for Wilson.
   After attending a breakfast for Wilson at a private residence,
Bush later today headed to Oklahoma to campaign for GOP
gubernatorial candidate Bill Price at the Cowboy Hall of Fame.
   The president arrived in San Francisco after a weekend in
Honolulu where he also did some politicking, met with Pacific
Island leaders and spoke to large crowd of military personnel and
families at Hickam Air Force Base.
   Referring to Iraq's Aug. 2 military invasion of Kuwait, Bush
said, ``Today in the Persian Gulf, what we are looking at is good
and evil, right and wrong ... The invasion of Kuwait will not
stand.''
   With U.S. troop strength at more than 200,000 and still growing
in the Persian Gulf region, Bush promised, ``No American will be
kept in the Gulf a single day longer than necessary. But we will
not walk away until our mission is done.''
   Bush told his audience that he empathizes with their worries.
   ``Those in uniform will always bear the heaviest burden. Perhaps
I know something of what you endure. The waiting, the uncertainty,
the demands of family and professional life. We want every single
American home,'' he said.
   Bush said Iraq ``waged a war of aggression, plundered a peaceful
neighbor, held innocents hostage and gassed its own people.''
   Those acts are punishable under 1945 war crimes principles, Bush
said, raising anew the specter of holding Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein accountable to some international forum.
   ``We're standing up for civilized values,'' he said.
   At Hickam, located next to Pearl Harbor, Bush said he was
reminded of his own World War II tour of duty in the Pacific.
   ``No member of that generation can ever forget the clarion call
that Pearl Harbor represented,'' the president said. ``Things
changed instantly. The country came together. And like you here
today, we each knew our duty.''
   While Sunday's speech was to a military audience, Bush also has
been calling for solidarity behind his Persian Gulf policy in his
campaign appearances around the country.
   Bush's coast-to-coast traveling comes as a Newsweek poll out
this weekend showed a dramatic plunge in the public's approval
rating for his job performance. The drop coincides with public
worries over the worsening economy and Washington's sluggish
attempts to deal with it.
   Lengthy wrangling over a deficit reduction pact finally
concluded over the weekend with Congress approving a budget deal
while Bush was in Hawaii. The president promised to sign it.
   After arriving in San Francisco Sunday night, Bush signed a
stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov.
5. He will use the intervening days to review the various
appropriations bills Congress has passed for spending in specific
categories, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush tonight was to return to a capital emptied of lawmakers who
went home to campaign.

<TEXT>
   Amtrak has initiated a faster passenger train
between Boston and New York, the New England Express, that is
intended to make the 230-mile trip in under four hours.
   The first trip Sunday almost met the mark.
   The Express left Boston's South Station at 11:15 a.m. and
arrived at Penn Station in Manhattan at 3:18 p.m., eight minutes
late, for an average speed of 57 mph, including stops.
   ``Not bad for a first try,'' said Clifford Black, an Amtrak
spokesman.
   The trip has taken about four hours and 40 minutes in the past,
for an average speed of about 45 mph.
   By comparison, Japan's ``bullet'' trains travel at about 130
mph, and France's high-speed trains hit about 200 mph. Both have
exclusive use of all-new tracks.
   Amtrak officials have saved some time on all lines by making
track and bridge repairs. The New England Express, scheduled for 12
trips a week each way, also skips some stops included in other
rides.
   To shorten the ride even more, Amtrak officials want to
electrify the entire Boston to New York route. At present, the
route is electrified only from New York to New Haven, Conn., where
trains must switch from diesel to electric power, or vice versa.
   Congress has proposed spending $125 million to begin work on
electrifying the entire line. Amtrak officials estimate the cost of
completing the job will be about $400 million.
   The ultimate time goal is a trip under three hours.
   The New England Express requires reservations, but the fare
remains the same as other scheduled service: $90 round trip for
coach and $154 for first class.
   Amtrak currently serves about 2 million passengers a year
between New York and Washington, D.C., on a faster, all-electric
line, on which the fastest combination of tracks has an average
speed of 90 mph.
   Train officials believe there is an even bigger market for the
Boston-New York route. ``It is one of the biggest business travel
corridors in the country,'' Black said.

<HEAD>U.N. Official Urges Steps To Curb Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top U.N. environment official on Monday urged
immediate steps by industrialized countries to curb global warming,
saying delay will only worsen a disaster looming over future
generations.
   Mostafa K. Tolba, head of the U.N. Environment Program, said a
``complete change in attitudes and lifestyles'' is needed to avert
a danger ``potentially more catastrophic than any other threat in
human history.''
   A decade of research has made clear that only drastic reductions
in emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping ``greenhouse
gases'' will stop warming of the planet, Tolba told the opening of
a U.N. climate conference.
   He said ``large gaps in our knowledge'' about the phenomenon
should not be an excuse for inaction.
   About 500 scientists attending the 10-day conference are
expected to draft a new program proposing ways to fight the
so-called greenhouse effect.
   A final meeting of about 80 ministers is expected to draw
several heads of government, including Margaret Thatcher of Britain
and France's Michel Rocard. The United States, still opposed to
binding emission cuts, has sent a lower-level delegation.
   The conference is supposed to launch formal negotiations on an
international convention against global warming, to be ready for
signing by mid-1992. Ministers are expected to provide the basis
for the talks in a final declaration Nov. 7.
   But Tolba said industrialized nations, which contribute
three-quarters of all man-made greenhouse gases, must cut emissions
even before a convention is in place.
   ``The longer we delay, the worse the disaster will be for our
children, and for our children's children,'' he said.
   He said curbing emissions will be costly and require great
changes in ``economic, legal and institutional systems.''
Developing countries would need more time and Western help.
   A conference report by more than 1,000 scientists from 70
countries outlines the climate upheaval likely if nothing is done:
   -Global temperatures could rise up to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit by
the end of the next century, the fastest rise in 10,000 years.
   -Sea levels may rise far enough to flood tens of thousands of
miles of shoreline, sending millions of people fleeing inland.
   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Administration, in a position
paper prepared for the conference, said the overall effect on
global farming ``could be positive'' because arable lands may open
up toward the poles.
   But ``the impact on some of today's vulnerable regions, like the
Sahel, may be very serious,'' it added.

<HEAD>Dukakis: Media May Be Too Hard on Bush's Drop in Polls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Monday the media
exaggerated the popularity of the man he ran against for president
in 1988, but now may be too hard on President Bush as his
popularity drops in the polls.
   Dukakis, whose own popularity in his home state is at a historic
low, made it clear his sympathy for Bush didn't indicate a change
of heart about the Republican president's domestic policies.
   ``I think part of the problem is that George Bush doesn't
believe in much domestically,'' Dukakis told reporters. ``He's much
more comfortable in foreign policy.''
   But Dukakis said the media have made too much of Bush's
popularity on both ends of the scale.
   `You guys exaggerated his popularity on the way up and you're
now beating him over the head on the way down,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis said presidents and governors must be prepared sometimes
to take actions that are unpopular.
   ``The sense I have these days is the White House takes a poll
every night before they do anything. You just can't do that,''
Dukakis said.
   ``His popularity will probably drop some more. So what. So what.
The question is are we doing the right thing, are we biting the
bullet, are we dealing with these very difficult fiscal problems
that have been in the making for the last 10 years?''
   Newsweek magazine recently released the results of a poll by the
Gallup Organization showing Bush had slipped to the lowest approval
rating of his presidency. The poll showed 48 percent approved of
Bush's handling of his job, down from 57 percent on Oct. 19.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction to their lowest level in more
than two years.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.8 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.12 percent, down from 7.20 percent
last week. Another $9.8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.13 percent, down from 7.16 percent.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.05
percent on Aug. 15, 1988, and six-month bills averaged 7.09 percent
on July 25, 1988.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.35 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,820.00, and 7.50 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,639.50.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index

   Vandals slashed two recent pop art works by Roy
Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist on display at the International
Contemporary Art Fair, organizers of the exhibition said Monday.
   The vandals, shouting anti-imperialist slogans, mutilated the
paintings Saturday with knives and dropped pamphlets before they
were arrested.
   Lichtenstein's ``Reflections on Senorita,'' (1990) estimated at
$1 million, and Rosenquist's ``Venturi Correction,'' (1990)
estimated at $350,000, were on show at the booth of the Leo
Castelli gallery in New York.
   Castelli, 83, was shaken by the incident but said he did not
hold anyone responsible.
   ``These are unpredictable things that happen and can't be
prevented. For me the affair is closed,'' he was quoted as saying
in Le Figaro.
   One of Castelli's employees said that following the incident, a
security guard had been posted inside the stand at the gallery's
request.
   The fair, considered the first major commercial art event of the
season, is expected to draw some 140,000 visitors to 155 stands
displaying the world's best contemporary paintings, drawings and
sculpture.
   Some gallery owners have complained of a lack of security. Last
week, a small painting by Philippe Favier was stolen.
   ``There are no barriers between the art and the visitors, which
means that in this enormous department store of art and sculpture,
you can caress a work with the palm of your hand,'' said Nathalie
Obadia of the Templon gallery.
   A spokeswoman for the one-week fair, which closes Thursday, said
security was adequate.
   ``There are enough guards to do the job. Besides, we can't put a
guard behind every work,'' she said on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Surgeon General Asks Beer Industry To Do More To Stop Drinking By
Minors</HEAD>
<HEAD>By LeROY TILLMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Surgeon General on Monday issued a
pre-Halloween warning to the beer industry, saying it should avoid
advertising practices that encourage drinking among minors.
   ``The beer industry should not capitalize on a season that
youngsters look forward to with great anticipation to push their
products,'' Dr. Antonia Novello said.
   ``Halloween and hops do not mix.''
   Dr. Novello said breweries and their advertising agencies were
sending the wrong message to minors, that alcohol consumption was
acceptable for children under the legal drinking age. She said they
should put larger warning labels on containers and revise
advertising practices.
   ``We would like the industry to share in the responsibility,''
she said. ``Children can either consciously or unconsciously be
affected by both print and electronic ads'' that for the most part
never show the harmful effects of alcohol consumption.
   Alcohol abuse was ``the number one substance abuse problem among
American youth,'' and indications were that the situation was
getting worse. Children were being enticed by advertisements for
so-called ``soft liquors,'' including beer, wine and wine coolers,
she added.
   The alcohol industry annually conducts its most intensive
advertising campaign between October and January. The National
Coalition on Television Violence estimated that before the average
American child turns 16, he would see 75,000 television scenes
where alcohol is consumed or its use encouraged.
   ``On radio and television and even at supermarket check-out
counters, we are being bombarded with exhortations ... this may be
the year that witches meet the wine cooler,'' Dr. Novello said.
   But James C. Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, said that
the Surgeon General's attack had become an annual harbinger of the
Halloween season and that there was no indication that more minors
were consuming alcoholic spirits.
   ``No amount of false accusations, or shoddy unverified research
can disprove the fact that all alcohol advertising, including
Halloween advertising, is carefully produced and placed to reach
adult audiences as mandated by the industry's stringent
guidelines,'' he said in a statement.
   Dr. Novello said there were indications that more children, some
as young as age 13, were illegally purchasing alcoholic beverages,
especially wine coolers that are frequently available at
convenience stores.
   According to the National High School Senior Survey conducted by
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse, more than 4.5 million
school aged teenagers had a drinking problem.
   The survey added that 43 percent of college students, 35 percent
of high school seniors and 26 percent of 8th grade students take as
many as five drinks a week.
   Dr. Novello said her office was working with educators
nationwide to steer teenagers and pre-teens away from consuming
liquor.

<HEAD>Conservative Coalition Resigns in Trade Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The center-right government resigned Monday
after the junior member of the year-old coalition refused to
support increased ties to the European Economic Community.
   ``I think it is deeply regrettable for the country,''
Conservative Prime Minister Jan P. Syse told national television
moments after the small Center Party quit his three-party alliance.
   Syse had hoped to form a minority government after his coalition
split over Norway's position in talks between the community and the
six-nation European Free Trade Association, of which Norway is a
member.
   The talks are to center on the creation of a joint economic
region.
   The Center Party, backed by farmers who fear a cut in subsidies
with freer trade policies, opposed the issue. It quit the coalition
and refused to back a single-party Conservative minority
government.
   Center's leader, Anne Enger Lahnstein, said the dispute had
moved beyond the trade issue and involved EEC membership itself.
   Syse, who supports eventually joining the EEC, said the issue
was fundamental to his government.
   ``A government must stand united in such a case, especially when
it concerns protecting Norway's interests in international
negotiations,'' Syse told Parliament as he announced the
coalition's resignation.
   Syse had hoped to form a new government because there is a slim
rightist majority among the six major parties in Parliament and no
elections are legally possible for three more years.
   Public disenchantment has increased due to tough austerity
programs, intended to pull Norway's oil dependent economy out of a
four-year slump that has brought record unemployment.
   Former Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland was expected to form
her third Labor Party administration - Norway's sixth government
since 1980. But no party holds a majority in the 165-seat
Parliament.
   The Labor Party controls 81 votes, 63 of its own, 17 from the
Socialist Left and one independent.
   Center did not indicate it would give its 11 votes to Labor on
all issues. But Center leaders indicated they would agree on the
issue of the EEC.
   Center's 11 votes in Parliament are usually counted in the
non-socialist bloc's 84 votes. The Conservatives have 37 seats, the
Christian Democrats' 14 and the Party of Progress has 22.
   The Party of Progress was excluded from Syse's coalition, with
Center and others viewing it as too extremist.
   The conflict between the Conservatives and Center may have been
aggravated last week when neighboring Sweden strongly hinted that
it would seek EEC membership, prompting calls in Norway for both
countries to join the community.
   The EEC considers some of Norway's protectionist laws
discriminatory towards foreigners.

   The Supreme Court on Monday allowed a state to
impose longer sentences automatically for criminals who used guns.
   The court, without comment, let stand a Montana law used to add
10 years to the 30-year prison sentence given a man who brandished
a gun during a pizza shop robbery.
   In a separate case, the court refused to let police in
Massachusetts stop and search someone solely because that person
reportedly was carrying a handgun in public.
   Over a dissenting vote by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the court
let stand a ruling by Massachusetts' highest court that
investigatory stops by police are unlawful if sparked by nothing
more than ``the mere possession of a handgun.''
   The Montana law was attacked as unconstitutional because Thomas
Krantz never faced any gun-possession charges. State courts did not
consider his use of the gun as a separate crime, but merely as a
``sentencing factor.''
   The Montana Supreme Court upheld the state law last March, by a
5-2 vote.
   Krantz was convicted of holding up a Missoula pizza shop, and of
driving the getaway car for a holdup at a Missoula motel a week
later.
   Prosecutors said Krantz was the masked gunman who staged the
first robbery.
   Convicted, he was sentenced to 30 years on the robbery charges.
But the presiding judge added 10 years to the sentence because
Krantz had used a gun.
   In its ruling last March, the state Supreme Court rejected
Krantz's arguments that prosecutors never presented such a charge
to a jury, or proved it beyond a reasonable doubt.
   In the Massachusetts case, two Lowell police officers, Gary
Richardson and Steven Morril, received a radio report that a
convenience store clerk had seen a man with the handle of a pistol
protruding from his pocket.
   The clerk had given police a description and license number of
the pickup truck the man had left in, and the two officers stopped
the vehicle.
   Richardson ordered the man, Paul Couture, out of the truck and
then searched the driver's compartment while Morril detained
Couture.
   Richardson found a small .38 caliber pistol for which Couture
said he did not have a license.
   A state trial judge barred prosecutors from using the seized gun
as evidence, and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld
that ruling.
   Stopping Couture and searching his truck violated his Fourth
Amendment protection against unreasonable police searches, the
state court ruled.

   The Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for a
Tacoma, Wash., woman to sue a state trooper she says left her
stranded in a high-crime area the night she was raped.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Trooper
Steven Ostrander is not immune from being sued by the woman.
   At the same time, the court refused to reinstate a $750,000
award won, and then lost, by a woman raped in a Cleveland-area
public transit system parking lot.
   The justices, again without comment, left intact a ruling that
the transit system owed the woman no ``special duty of care'' even
though another woman had been raped in the same parking lot the
previous night.
   In other action Monday, the court:
   -Rejected a constitutional attack against a Montana law that
automatically imposes longer sentences for criminals who used guns.
   -Refused to let police in Massachusetts stop and search someone
solely because that person reportedly was toting a handgun in
public.
   -Let stand a federal judge's order requiring three suburban
Kansas City, Mo., school districts to accept black students from
inner-city schools.
   -Let stand a ruling that the at-large system used in Norfolk,
Va., since 1918 to elect city council elections violates the rights
of black voters. InThe average price for strict low middling 1 &amp; 1-16 inch

   The U.S. military's top expert on
the medical effects of chemical warfare said Monday that history
shows over 95 percent of those hit by nerve and mustard gas have
survived.
   ``I think the threat of chemical warfare is very real. ... But
you're not talking about some devastatingly effective weapon,''
said Col. Michael Dunn, commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research
Institute of Chemical Defense.
   His message to 95 doctors, nurses and medics finishing a
three-day course on treating victims of chemical warfare attacks
was simple: ``There are very effective things you can do to deal
with chemical casualties.''
   For the 350,000-strong multinational force gathered in the
Persian Gulf region following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the
biggest fear is the possibility that Saddam Hussein will use
chemical weapons if war breaks out.
   ``We hope it doesn't happen, but if it does, we'll be ready,''
said Spec. 4 Robert Staklinski, 22, of Darlington, S.C., a medical
corpsman. He had just played the victim of a simulated chemical
attack, twitching and moaning on a stretcher as half-dozen doctors
and medics hovered over him with a five-minute deadline to make a
diagnosis and initiate treatment.
   Dr. Mark Lawson, a 36-year-old Navy gastroenterologist from St.
Petersburg, Fla., said he knew ``next to nothing'' about chemical
warfare victims when he came to the gulf but now feels confident he
can treat them and protect himself.
   ``This (course) has taken away a lot of the fear of the unknown,
especially when you realize that less than 5 percent die,'' he
said.
   Dunn, the senior U.S. member of a NATO panel on medical-chemical
defense, said his greatest concern is for troops within 25 miles of
the front who are within range of Iraqi artillery and short-range
rockets used in the past to launch chemical weapons.
   During the eight-year Persian Gulf war, when Iraq regularly used
chemical weapons against Iran, more than 45,000 people were
attacked by mustard gas, he said. Only about 3 percent died, mainly
from obstruction of the respiratory system.
   To a lesser degree, the Iraqis also used nerve agents, mainly
Tabun and Sarin, with about a one in 20 fatality rate.
   ``Ever since World War I, right up until the end of (the Persian
Gulf war) in 1988, chemical warfare agents which have a reputation
of being lethal are really a greater cause of non-fatal injuries
than they are of fatal injuries,'' Dunn, of Clarksville, Md., said.
   ``Over 95 percent of chemical casualties are living chemical
casualties who aren't going to die but who stand a chance of being
disabled or having a prolonged recovery,'' he said.
   The aim of the 15 three-day courses being held in the Desert
Shield area for American, Saudi Arabian and other allied medical
personnel, is to ensure that they have the best equipment and
information ``to maximize recovery,'' Dunn said.
   The last American soldier to be attacked by chemical weapons was
in World War I.
   Ironically, the Iraqis, along with the Iranians, have provided
the Americans with much of their insight into the modern treatment
of chemical warfare victims.
   Last December, Dunn said, he attended an international
conference in Kuwait City and discussed chemical casualty care with
Iranian and Iraqi doctors. ``There was a very free exchange of
information so there are no secrets,'' he said.
   ``They have a very effective chemical casualty care system that
they learned at high human cost and our objective here is to get
better than they are without having to pay that human cost,'' Dunn
said.
   The Iraqis were most effective using chemical weapons against
civilians and the Iranian revolutionary guards whose beards, worn
for religious reasons, prevented a tight seal on their gas masks,
he said.
   All U.S. combat forces in the gulf are drilled repeatedly in
quickly donning protective masks, and in injecting themselves with
antidotes in case of attack.
   The course for medical personnel, being given at a U.S. Marine
Corps hospital, is a compressed version of a five-day course given
in the United States, which about 80 percent of physicians pass.
   Dunn said over 98 percent of the doctors here pass the final.
   ``What you're looking at here is a sense of immediacy and
urgency of purpose,'' he said.
   ``Back in the States you take this stuff for granted,'' said
medical corpsman Joe Campbell, 26, of Pensacola, Fla. ``But here
your life depends on it, so you take it alittle more seriously.''

<HEAD>Soviet Official: Int'l Pressure Could Stop Arctic Nuclear Tests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's environment minister
on Monday appealed for international pressure on Moscow to stop
nuclear explosions in the arctic.
   ``If it was up to me I would stop the tests immediately. What we
need is an international moratorium,'' Nikolai Voronchov said at
the start of an international environment conference.
   ``We have appealed to the highest authorities in the Soviet
Union ... but what we need is international pressure to stop the
tests, from the public and the press,'' the Soviet official said.
   The Soviet Union exploded a nuclear device on Wednesday in the
island group of Novaya Zemlya, less than 500 miles from Finland and
Norway. The explosion came after a two-year break in Soviet nuclear
tests on the islands.
   Voronchov said he had not been informed of the test beforehand
and that he could not guarantee that no others would take place.
   ``But I don't think it is the start of a new series,'' he said.
   The Nordic countries formally protested the test to Soviet
Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Karpov in Moscow on Monday, Finnish
national radio reported.
   In the protest note, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and
Iceland urged the Soviet Union to allow Nordic experts to view
conditions at the test site, the report said.
   Voronchov said he would do his utmost to help win permission for
Finnish experts to visit the island.
   He also gave his backing to the idea of an international nuclear
test-monitoring group.
   ``If Finland, as a neutral country, proposed such a group I am
sure the nuclear powers would take note,'' Voronchov said.
   The two-day Ministerial Meeting on Technology and Financing for
the Environment was attended by more than 120 representatives from
nine countries in the Nordic region and Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
   A Japanese consortium has pledged $1.5 million
toward renovation of the Freer Gallery of Art, a national museum of
Asian art and the Smithsonian Institution's first art museum,
gallery officials announced Monday.
   The gift is the largest received by the gallery since it opened
in 1923 with a bequest from Detroit industrialist Charles Lang
Freer, who gave the Smithsonian his art collection, a building fund
and an endowment.
   The Japanese gift will be used to finance reinstallation of the
original Freer collection of 13,000 objects, most of them Asian art
but also including the world's most important collection of works
by American painter James McNeill Whistler.
   A $21 million renovation and expansion of the Freer museum began
in late 1988 and is scheduled for completion in late 1992. The
Japanese gift leaves $4.5 million still to be raised, officials
said.
   The Japanese consortium consists of Prof. Ikuo Hirayama, a
painter and president of the National University of Fine Art and
Music; the Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. and the Nomura Cultural
Foundation of Tokyo.

<TEXT>
   The commander of this U.S.
cruiser expressed confidnce Monday that even if Iraq launched
dozens of jets and missiles simultaneously, his crew could keep
track of them all.
   ``If it's in the sky flying around, we can find it,'' Capt.
Lawrence Eddingfield said at an news conference aboard the USS
Antietam in the Persian Gulf.
   The Antietam, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser, is in
charge of anti-air warfare in the gulf, he said.
   As such, ``we keep track of everything that's flying in the
central and northern Persian Gulf,'' including military and
civilian aircraft, said Eddingfield.
   The Antietam is the ``highest state-of-the-art ship the Navy
has,'' said Lt. Mark Wenzel, 30, of Fort Walton Beach, Fla. Its
radar and sonar electronics are integrated with a sophisticated
missile system, he said.
   The cruiser is equpped with the Aegis radar and weapons system,
including four Spy-1 radar shields that flank each side of the
567-foot vessel. The ship carries a crew of more than 370 men.
   In 1988, during the Iran-Iraq war, the Vincennes, another
Aegis-equipped cruiser on patrol in the Persian Gulf, accidentally
shot down an Iranian civilian aircraft, killing all 290 people
aboard.
   U.S. investigators concluded that the pressure of first-time
combat caused Vincennes radar operators to misinterpret crucial
computer data, and recommended stress and the ``human factor'' be
studied for future training purposes.
   ``Everybody learned a few lessons, including people flying
commercial airliners,'' said Eddingfield. He dismissed any danger
of a potential repeat incident.
   The Antietam is the only ship of its class deployed to support
Operation Desert Shield. The United States has a naval armada and
more than 220,000 troops amassed in the region in the standoff with
Saddam Hussein over his Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
   Other Aegis cruisers are on station in the Mediterranean and Red
Seas.
   The Antietam can fire surface-to-surface Tomahawks and Harpoons,
or surface-to-air Standard missiles. So far the Antietam has been
involved in 167 interceptions, but no boardings, as part of the sea
blockade of Iraq.
   Atop the ship's bridge, Assistant Fire Ensign Robert West, 25,
of St. Louis, strained to hear radio communication between an
American ship and an unidentified merchant vessel on a course to
Jubail, Saudi Arabia.
   Operation Spec. 1st Class Calvin Carter, 35, of Washington,
D.C., was seated at his station in the darkened Combat Information
Center (CIC) in another part of the ship. He keeps a watchful eye
on four brilliant blue radar screens.
   The screens are maps of Saudi Arabia and outlaying regions
dotted with symbols indicating aircraft, ships, or submarines.
   CIC is the heart of the entire Aegis radar system.
   ``This is where all the information of the Aegis system and
other ships merges. It is also our watch center that directs
aircraft, as well as our own folks that operate the weapon
system,'' said Wenzel.
   Specialist Carter said that in the event of an emergency, about
50 personnel would be manning the computer stations inside CIC.

   Here, at a glance, are Monday's developments in the Persian Gulf
crisis:
   
   Hundreds of French citizens left Baghdad on a flight to freedom
after three months as hostages of Saddam Hussein. Among the
Frenchmen were the last seven diplomats who endured an arduous
siege of their embassy in occupied Kuwait.
   ---
   Freed hostage Patrick Moniodde said he met at least a dozen
American and British hostages and noted they were ``very
depressed.''
   ``The Iraqis constantly move hostages from one site to
another,'' said Moniodde. ``There was no hygiene,'' he said.
``Toilets were very dirty, but we always got medical care. Sure,
Iraqis do not want to lose any hostages. We are free today, but it
is terrible for others.''
   ---
   The U.N. Security Council voted to hold Iraq liable for damages
caused by its seizure of Kuwait. The resolution, the 10th since
Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, was approved by 13 nations. Cuba and
Yemen abstained. The new resolution also demands that Baghdad allow
food, water and other supplies to be sent to Western diplomatic
missions in Kuwait.
   ---
   Campaigning in San Francisco, President Bush said he would not
hesitate to use force in the Persian Gulf if provoked. ``History is
replete with examples when the president had to take action''
without consulting Congress, he added. Bush said he would meet
Tuesday with congressional leaders about the U.S. military buildup
in the Persian Gulf, a deployment that could expand while Congress
is adjourned.
   ---
   The European Community nations said that the gulf crisis has not
caused a decline in oil supplies and that their strategic stocks
exceed three months of normal consumption. The EC energy ministers
said oil prices ``remain high, basically for emotive or speculative
reasons.''
   ---
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said that if Iraq's Saddam
Hussein thinks he can divide the international alliance opposing
him, he is wrong. The Soviet leader also said the latest mission to
Baghdad by his envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, indicated there were some
shifts in Saddam's positions. He did not elaborate. Primakov met
Sunday with Saddam.
   ---
   Saddam told the Cable News Network it would be wrong to say
nothing was accomplished by Primakov's visit. He said he told
Primakov ``how the solutions could be reached to many of the issues
in the region.''

<HEAD>Soviet, French Leaders Sign Friendship, Cooperation Pact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidents Mikhail Gorbachev of the
Soviet Union and Francois Mitterrand of France signed a friendship
pact Monday providing for immediate consultations if either country
feels threatened by conflict.
   The two leaders signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation
after an overnight visit to Paris by the Soviet leader.
   ``In the case of situations which, in the view of one of the
parties, create a threat to peace, a breach of peace or provoke
international tension, the governments of France and the Soviet
Union will enter into contact without delay to coordinate all
aspects of such situations,'' the treaty said.
   The treaty fell short of a non-aggression pact, similar to the
treaty Moscow concluded recently with Germany. French officials say
France will adhere to its commitments to NATO and the European
Community, making a non-aggression clause unnecessary.
   The treaty was the first between the countries since a
friendship pact in 1944, and France's first bilateral treaty in 27
years. It was signed at the chateau of Rambouillet, 33 miles
southwest of Paris.
   ``We have done a great deal of work in a short time,'' Gorbachev
said at a joint news conference with Mitterrand. ``This reflects
the new level of cooperation and understanding between the
leadership of our two countries which enables us to obtain
results.''
   The broad agreement calls for regular political consultations.
It also provides for cooperation in energy, non-military nuclear
science, transportation, high-definition television and
telecommunications.
   France and the Soviet Union pledge to ``reinforce European
solidarity'' and seek the creation of a European confederation.
   The treaty promised French assistance as the Soviet Union shifts
to a market economy, and French help in arranging accords between
Moscow and the 12-nation European Community.
   The treaty also provides for reimbursement by the Soviets to
holders ofbonds issued by the Czarist governments of Russia from
1822-1917, said Alexei Glukhov, a member of the Soviet delegation.
   More than 250,000 people and institutions in France, including
the government, hold such bonds, theoretically worth billions of
dollars. Glukhov said details of the repayment plan remained to be
worked out.
   The two leaders said at a joint news conference that their views
were in harmony, including on the Persian Gulf crisis. Gorbachev
suggested tightening of U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq for
its invasion of Kuwait, but said he saw indications the sanctions
were beginning to take effect.
   He also said an inter-Arab conference would be the quickest and
most appropriate solution to the crisis.
   Gorbachev arrived Sunday evening after a three-day visit to
Spain, where he obtained $1.5 billion in guaranteed loans to help
ease the transition away from a centralized economy.
   The trip was Gorbachev's first abroad since winning the Nobel
Peace Prize earlier this month.

   The British Embassy in Lima confirmed Monday
that two ornithologists missing in a drug-rich jungle area since
June are feared dead.
   An Embassy spokesman made the statement in response to a Lima
newspaper report Sunday claiming Shining Path guerrillas killed
British bird-watchers Michael Alan Entwistle, 30, and Timothy Peter
Andrews, 32, in the Upper Huallaga River Valley area on June 11.
   The spokesman was unable to confirm the newspaper report, but
said the Embassy was in touch with police in the jungle city of
Tingo Maria, 200 miles northeast of Lima, where the Britons were
last seen.
   The spokesman said an Embassy press release issued in Tingo
Maria two weeks ago brought forward two informants who remembered
having seen the two Britons. One of the informants claimed to have
seen one of the Britons taken away against his will by a large
group of men, the spokesman said.
   Lima's daily La Republica, quoting Tingo Maria residents, said
Sunday the guerrillas suspected the Britons of being U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents.
   The two men traveled to the area June 1 to visit the Cueva de
las Lechuzas cave, known for its variety of birdlife, about 18
miles west of Tingo Maria, according to La Republica.
   The Upper Huallaga Valley is a jungle area dominated by drug
traffickers in league with Maoist guerrillas who provide protection
in exchange for arms and money.
   Ten foreign tourists were killed by the Shining Path last year.

   Harvard University said Monday it will

months after threatening to cancel the forum unless the United
States removed travel restrictions on people infected with AIDS.
   The conference, the principle forum for presenting scientific
information on the fight against the disease, will go ahead in the
last week of May 1992, school officials said.
   In June, the Harvard AIDS Institute threatened to withdraw as
sponsor and cancel the conference to protest a U.S. policy that
made AIDS infection one of several contagious diseases for which
foreigners could be barred from the country.
   But under an immigration bill passed over the weekend, the U.S.
government would be allowed to remove AIDS and other diseases from
the medical list for which a person may be denied entry.
   The conference is expected to attract about 15,000 researchers,
policy makers, community organizers and AIDS patients, Harvard
officials said.

<TEXT>
   Moslem extremists assassinated Egypt's
parliamentary speaker in a botched attempt to kill the interior
minister, who they blamed for the deaths of 14 fundamentalists, a
presidential source said Monday.
   Preliminary police reports, based on the confessions of 10
suspects who have admitted involvement in the Oct. 12 slaying, came
to the same conclusion, according to sources in the Interior
Ministry.
   ``According to their confessions they said they wanted to kill
the interior minister,'' said the presidential source, who spoke on
condition he not be identified further.
   Rifaat el-Mahgoub, speaker of the People's Assembly, his driver
and four security men were killed when assailants opened fired as
they drove in two cars by a luxury hotel on a corniche by the Nile.
   The source in President Hosni Mubarak's office said he is
convinced Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa was the target
because Moussa usually followed the same route to his office that
el-Mahgoub took that day.
   Shortly after the assassination, Moussa told reporters his car
had been a few hundred yards behind the limousine carrying
el-Mahgoub.
   Moussa at the time dismissed speculation the assassins' bullets
were meant for him. Islamic fundamentalists twice in 1987 attempted
to assassinate Egyptian interior ministers. One of the ministers
was badly wounded.
   The presidential source said Monday that Moussa's car had
actually passed the site of the assassination a few minutes before
the gunmen struck el-Mahgoub's Mercedes.
   The two factors that saved Moussa, said the source, were that he
chose not to ride in his black Mercedes that day and that his car
was not accompanied by a motorcycle policeman because it was
Friday, the Moslem Sabbath, and traffic was light.
   ``The ambush was waiting for a motorcycle followed by a black
Mercedes. He (Moussa) went unnoticed,'' the presidential source
said. ``Then came the unfortunate el-Mahgoub. It's sure that he was
mistaken for Moussa.''
   El-Mahgoub was technically the second-ranking official in Egypt,
after President Mubarak. But there was no particular reason he
would have been targeted, either by Moslem extremists or by foreign
terrorists.
   The interior minister, on the other hand, is in charge of most
security functions in Egypt.
   Early speculation focused on Iraqi or Palestinian agents,
possibly in league with Egyptian religious zealots, in a conspiracy
developed in Baghdad to punish Egypt for its anti-Iraq stand in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Police still are not ruling out a possible Iraqi or Palestinian
connection, the Interior Ministry sources said. They said large
amounts of money were found with the recently arrested suspects.
   There have been no on-the-record pronouncements on the
investigation into the slaying. But as pieced together so far, the
Interior Ministry sources said, the attack appears to have been
meant as revenge for police actions.
   In April, police killed 13 Islamic fundamentalists and wounded
six in clashes in Fayoum province, 60 miles southwest of Cairo.
Last month, unidentified gunmen killed physician Alaa Mohi el-Din,
spokesman of the Islamic Gamaa, an umbrella organization for the
militant Moslems. No one has been arrested in connection with the
shooting, but the Gamaa blame the police.
   ``The Moslem extremists had threatened to take their revenge,''
one police officer said. ``The first suspect, who was arrested last
Wednesday and identified the others ... said their aim was (to
kill) the interior minister.''
   Police on Saturday killed two suspects alleged to have been
triggermen in el-Mahgoub's death. A police report said fingerprints
in a car commandeered briefly by an escaping assassin matched those
of a man wounded in Saturday's clash.
   One police officer said some suspects in the case are claiming
they gave false confessions under torture. The prisoners are
demanding medical examinations to confirm their torture, the
officer said.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, and
other rights organizations claim Egyptian interrogators use
beatings and other torture against political detainees.

<HEAD>`Civil War' Filmmaker Blames TV For Decline In Knowledge Of
History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filmmaker Ken Burns, creator of the widely
praised ``The Civil War'' public television series, says television
is mostly to blame for a decline in high school students' knowledge
of history.
   In a luncheon speech Monday at the National Press Club, Burns
said television is ``substituting a distracting cultural monarchy''
for the cultural democracy and diversity that was promised when
television was introduced.
   ``Television has equipped us as citizens to live only in an
all-consuming - and thereby forgettable and disposable - present,
blissfully unaware of the historical tides and movements that speak
not only to this moment, but to our vast future as well,'' he said.
   ``This environment ensures that we have no history,'' Burns
said. ``And by so doing, ensures that we have no future.''
   Burns blasted television for offering Americans ``nearly the
same thing everywhere ... on dozens of clone-like channels,'' and
for ``conferring a kind of cultural peerage'' on a small group of
TV commentators.
   ``Issues and ideas are merely pushed around the plate, never
digested, by the same people ... engaged more with a subtle
one-upmanship among themselves and their TV alter egos than with
the advancement of our understanding,'' Burns said.
   ``In the worst of our television, we are addicted to
personality, to the breathless embrace of celebrity, ensuring as we
go a tyranny of the televised over the great mass of the
un-televised,'' he said.

   Congress' refusal to provide more money for
savings and loan bailouts will delay the closing of failed
institutions for months and add millions, or even billions, of
dollars to taxpayers' costs, analysts said Monday.
   Legislators' election-year squeeze left the Resolution Trust
Corp., the bailout agency created last year, without the funds
needed to close more than 300 insolvent or near-insolvent thrift
associations.
   That means the institutions will continue to run losses, funding
themselves with high-interest deposits. That in turn weakens
healthy competitors by forcing them to raise their deposit rates,
raising the specter of additional failures.
   ``It's going to cost us additional money. We're going to have to
slow up the resolution of failed thrifts,'' L. William Seidman,
chairman of the trust corporation, said in a telephone interview.
   He estimated the cost of a three-month delay at $250 million to
$300 million. The Congressional Budget Office put it at $300
million to $400 million, while Bert Ely, a private analyst in
Alexandria, Va., estimated it at $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
   The added costs, although spread over the life of the bailout
program, will make it even harder for the government to meet the
$500 billion deficit-reduction goal in the five-year program
adopted over the weekend.
   The trust corporation, which had handled 287 failed thrifts
through the end of September, has enough money left to pay
acquirers to take over an additional 65 to 75 small institutions by
the end of this year, according to spokesman Steven Katsanos.
   But that would still leave it with more than 100 S&amp;Ls to handle
on top of several hundred others judged to be near failure.
   Also, financing disruptions tend to discourage potential bidders
and make it more difficult for the agency to hire the outside
experts it needs, he said.
   ``The private sector doesn't adapt well to uncertainty about
whether the bill is going to be paid,'' he said.
   The agency has already been forced to delay seeking acquirers
for 18 large institutions until its funding is secure, Katsanos
said.
   Congress' Sunday morning revolt against further spending left
Bush administration officials and Democrats blaming each other for
the expected consequences.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas., chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's refusal to
testify in support of the administration's request ``created an
unfortunate atmosphere'' for approval of more money.
   ``They've got to get out of that bunker over there in the
Treasury and come over here and join the people,'' Gonzalez said in
a telephone interview.
   However, Desiree Tucker-Sorini, deputy assistant secretary of
the Treasury, said, ``The need for action and the consequences for
failing to act were spelled out in great detail over a period of
months by the (Treasury) secretary and others.''
   Private analysts were unimpressed by both sides' arguments and
likened the situation to 1988 and 1986 when political wrangling
left the RTC's predecessor, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp., short of money.
   ``It's a very sad comment on politics. ... It's a very lame
excuse,'' said Ohio State University professor Edward J. Kane.
   ``They were playing a game of chicken to see who blinks at the
last minute,'' Ely said. ``The House wanted Brady to come up and
bow and scrape and he refused. ... Nobody blinked, so we ended up
with a delay. A costly one.''
   Brady told Congress by letter that the administration needed $40
billion to cover S&amp;L losses through September 1991, in addition to
the $50 billion provided by last year's S&amp;L law.
   The Senate early Sunday had adopted a measure that would have
provided $10 billion to the trust corporation, enough to keep it
going until after Congress' scheduled return in January.
   However, the House adjourned without acting on a similar bill
after Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., raised procedural objections
that would have required adoption by a two-thirds vote.
   ``He just felt that bringing it up after midnight on the final
night of the session was not the time to sneak ... new funding
through,'' said Curtis Prins, staff director of Annunzio's House
Banking financial institutions subcommittee.
   Gonzalez pledged speedy action by his committee when Congress
returns. Until then, he said the administration could take
advantage of a drafting error in last year's law which would permit
it to borrow, short-term, an additional $18.8 billion. Treasury
officials earlier hinted that they would borrow the additional
money and were meeting Monday to discuss the option.
   Economist George Kaufman of Loyola University of Chicago said
the financing delay, while unfortunate, may have the beneficial
side effect of encouraging the trust corporation to more quickly
sell the $160 billion in loans, real estate and other assets it has
inherited from failed thrifts.

   Protesters against U.S. involvement in the
Middle East burned flags and trashed a fast-food restaurant Monday,
and police arrested more than 60 demonstrators.
   At least 200 protesters had gathered outside the Pacific Stock
Exchange by 6 a.m., said police Sgt. Bob Crosat. They were met by
between 100 and 200 officers, he said.
   The protesters chanted and carried signs, but when the crowd
headed for Market Street, the mood changed, he said. When
demonstrators arrived at a McDonald's restaurant, the violence
began, Crosat said.
   ``They broke tables and windows and scattered food around,''
said Crosat. A couple of American flags also were burned during the
2{-hour protest.
   Sixty-one demonstrators were arrested for investigation of
misdemeanor charges that included failure to disperse at an
unlawful assembly, vandalism and trespassing, said Officer Dave
Ambrose.
   The protest was sponsored by the Earth Action Network, which
publicized the event as a legal, nonviolent ``pro-environment and
anti-corporate demonstration and blockade'' of the Pacific Stock
Exchange.
   The demonstration did not appear to be timed to coincide with
President Bush's visit Monday to San Francisco. There was no
mention of the president in organizers' news releases and little
reference to him in the marches.
   While in town, Bush said he would not hesitate to use force in
the Persian Gulf if provoked. ``History is replete with examples
when the president had to take action'' without consulting
Congress, he added.

<HEAD>Biologists Search For Dead Animals After Cyanide Spill Into River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of gallons of a dilute cyanide
solution spilled from a gold refinery and biologists Monday
searched along the Lynches River to see if it had harmed livestock
or wildlife.
   Elsewhere, oil from a coke plant's discharge pipe spilled into
the Monongahela River Monday at Pittsburgh, creating a shimmering,
4-mile-long slick, authorities said.
   Health and wildlife officials in South Carolina reported no fish
kills or problems with animals that might drink from the river.
   The spill posed little threat to drinking water supplies but
officials warned residents to keep animals from tainted water.
   About 11 million gallons of the solution of sodium cyanide had
spilled by midday Monday into the Little Fork Creek after an
earthen dam broke Sunday at the Brewer Gold Mining Co. The
reservoir held about 13 million to 14 million gallons.
   The liquid contained only 50 parts of sodium cyanide per
million, said Richard Carnes, director of the Chesterfield County
Emergency Preparedness Division.
   Undiluted sodium cyanide would be fatal, but the spill created
only a minimal health risk to people and animals because it would
be significantly diluted after mixing with river water, said Thom
Berry, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Environmental.
   However, the cyanide wasn't the only threat from the spill.
   ``Our concern right now is not so much the cyanide but levels of
copper we're seeing in the discharge,'' Berry said. Some copper
compounds also can kill aquatic life, he said.
   The sodium cyanide solution began spilling Sunday afternoon from
a holding pond at Brewer, officials said. Brewer uses sodium
cyanide to separate gold from ore.
   The holding pond is about 2,000 feet from the Little Fork Creek
and two miles from Lynches.
   Carnes said recent heavy rain in the area might have weakened
the dam.
   Crews worked to diverted remaining chemical in the reservoir
into Brewer's discharge treatment system to be neutralized with
chlorine and hydrogen peroxide, Berry said.
   Brewer officials did not return telephone calls Monday.
   Wildlife and health officials took water samples from the river
along a series of stations along the river, said Berry.
   Marine biologists in three boats covered the Lynches, creeks and
tributaries in search of dead fish, said John Evans of the state
Department of Wildlife and Marine Resources. Game biologists
searched the banks for deer, fox, racoon and waterfowl, he said.
   The nearest municipality that draws from the water for its
drinking supply is the city of Georgetown, along the coast about
110 miles from Jefferson, Berry said.
   The mine began operation in 1987 and was fined by the
Environmental Protection Agency in March for failure to promptly
report a spill of up to 1,800 gallons of liquid containing sodium
cyanide, authorities said. That stemmed from a March 1988 spill in
which a 2-inch line carrying sodium cyanide solution ruptured.
   In Pittsburgh, the slow-moving oil spill stretched 4 miles from
the LTV Steel Co. plant to the downtown Point State Park, where the
Monongahela and Allegheny rivers join to form the Ohio River, said
Betsy Mallison, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Environmental Resources.
   As a precaution, water plants serving about 38,000 customers in
West View and RobinsonTownship were advised to test their water
for fuel, said Gina Pferdehirt, a spokesman for the Allegheny
County Health Department.
   ``It's beginning to break up. We don't feel the water supplies
are threatened,'' Ms. Mallison said.
   LTV spokesman Mark Tomasch said the company was unable to
determine whether the fuel came from its coke plant or from another
company that uses the pipe.

<HEAD>Bush: `No Hesitancy' in Using Force if Saddam Provokes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

   President Bush said Monday ``we'd
have no hesitancy at all'' to use military force in the Persian
Gulf if provoked by Iraq and indicated he feels no obligation to
get Congress' approval.
   ``History is replete with examples where the president has had
to take action,'' Bush said. Apparently referring to the U.S.
invasion of Panama, Bush said, ``I've done this in the past, and
certainly, somebody mentioned provocation, we'd have no hesitancy
at all.''
   Bush said he was not trying to prepare the country for war.
   ``I'm just doing my job as president of the United States,'' he
said. ``I'm not preparing anybody for anything. I'm as determined
as I've ever been that this aggression will not stand.''
   Bush spoke at an airport news conference in San Francisco after
campaigning for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson in his race for
governor. Later, he flew to Oklahoma City to appear at the Cowboy
Hall of Fame with Bill Price, the GOP candidate for governor in
Oklahoma.
   Shrugging off his slump in the polls, he accused Democrats of
trying to win elections through ``tax the rich, class warfare kind
of garbage.''
   ``I think people know that this Congress is controlled by the
taxers, by the liberal Democrats,'' Bush said in a sharply
political attack eight days before Election Day.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was echoing
Bush's tough gulf statements in a speech in Los Angeles.
   ``We are exhausting every diplomatic avenue to achieve (a
peaceful) solution without further bloodshed,'' Baker said. But he
added, ``Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a possible use of
force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait.''
   The White House policy in the Persian Gulf has won strong
bipartisan support in Congress, although there is a growing feeling
that Bush should consult lawmakers before sending troops into any
combat. More than 200,000 American forces have been deployed to the
gulf after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said last week that as many as
100,000 more troops may be dispatched.
   The gulf crisis will be at the top of the agenda when Bush meets
with congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday. The
president also is to consult with Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who just returned from the
Middle East.
   Bush appeared unmoved by demands that Congress should be asked
in advance before he sends troops into action.
   ``I know the authorities that a president has,'' Bush said.
``I'm working to try to get this matter resolved peacefully. We
have a lot of force there and they're well trained, they're highly
motivated and that alone is sending an enormously strong signal to
Saddam Hussein.''
   Bush also said the Soviet Union remains aligned with the United
States against Iraq. He said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
``is holding just as firm as he can. And that's good, you see,
because that sends a strong signal that the free world is united
against this dictator.''
   The Oklahoma stop concluded a five-day campaign trip that took
Bush as far west as Hawaii while Congress was wrapping up a $490
billion deficit-reduction agreement. Bush said he had felt
politically restrained while the agreement was being put together
but now is taking off the gloves.
   ``I don't like being on the defense,'' he said. ``I like being
on the offense.''
   The president will hit Democrats again in a speech in Washington
on Tuesday and then hit the road Thursday for nonstop campaigning
until the election.
   Bush has paid a big political price because of his changes on
taxes and because of Democrats' efforts to portray him - and other
Republicans - as defenders of the rich.
   ``I'm used to that kind of demagoguery and so I'm out here now
on the campaign trail laying it to rest,'' Bush said. ``I've got to
get that in focus because they've been getting away with this tax
the rich, class warfare kind of garbage that they always resurrect
at election time.''
   Amid sharp Republican divisions on taxes and the budget, Bush's
popularity has dropped below 50 percent in the polls, the lowest of
his presidency.
   ``These polls don't mean anything to me,'' Bush said.
   ``The American people are fair,'' he added. ``They know I'm
against taxes.'
   In the budget negotiations, Bush resisted increasing the tax
load on the rich but in the end finally agreed to raise the tax
rate on the highest income brackets to 31 percent, from 28 percent
now. The package also chips away at high-income taxpayers' itemized
deductions.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular toy known as the ``slap-wrist''
bracelet may cause hand and wrist injuries to children, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday.
   The wrist bracelet is a thin strip of metal covered by woven
fabric or paper. The toy wraps into the bracelet when the wrist is
struck with the bracelet.
   The commission said the toys have passed tests given to items
with sharp edges.
   But the panel said it is concerned that, over time, the fabric
or paper covering the thin metal may tear, exposing the user to a
sharp metal edge. As a result, lacerations may occur.
   The panel said parents should alert children to the potential
danger and should examine the toys frequently. In the event a tear
occurs, the toy should be discarded.
   The commission said it is continuing its investigation into the
toy to see if further action is warranted. The commission is
responsible for product safety.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned Iraq on
Monday not to ``lay a finger on Israel'' lest Saddam Hussein ``pay
a terrible price for his blunder.''
   Shamir told Jewish fundraisers at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in
Jerusalem, ``Our very presence in this region, thanks to our strong
will and capacity, (has) been and continues to be a force for
stability, a barrier that prevented many military adventures and
much more violence.''
   He reassured the audience that Iraqi President Saddam's attempts
to coax Israel into the conflict in the Persian Gulf would fail.
   ``Saddam Hussein must surely know that if he lays a finger on
Israel he will pay a terrible price for such a blunder,'' Shamir
said. ``This attempt to drag us into the present conflict ... will
not succeed.''
   Earlier, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai announced economic
reforms that included an additional military budget of a
quarter-billion dollars in light of the gulf crisis, Israel army
radio said.
   Saddam has repeatedly threatened to torch Israel with binary
chemical weapons. His first threat came in April when he said he
would to use chemical weapons in answer to an Israeli nuclear
attack. He later said an American attack would also lead to an
attack on Israel.
   The Israeli government has taken these threats seriously and has
distributed gas mask kits to the general public.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he does
not expect to visit Israel on his trip to the Middle East and
Europe starting Friday.
   Baker, who will use the trip to consult on the gulf crisis, told
a gathering in Los Angeles a stopover in Israel would leave the
impresion there is a linkage between the Arab-Israeli conflict and
the gulf crisis.
   ``We are very anxious that there not be a linkage,'' Baker said.

   The campaign manager for Republican Senate
candidate Hal Daub raised more questions about Democratic Sen. Jim
Exon's drinking habits, and Daub's wife denied allegations that her
husband had abused her.
   Jim Putnam said Sunday that Daub's campaign has been receiving
reports from people who have seen Exon appear intoxicated. Putnam
said Exon's explanantion that medication he had taken years ago for
gallbladder problems may have made him appear tipsy was
insufficient.
   ``Now perhaps there is a medical explanation for this. But it
certainly cannot all be written off to a gall bladder condition,''
Putnam said in a statement.
   In response, Exon campaign chairman Charles Pallesen called the
news release ``a disgusting collection of falsehoods.''
   ``These actions are unfortunately becoming commonplace from a
campaign that is broke, in debt and floundering in the polls,''
Pallesen said.
   Exon's lead has increased to 26 percentage points, according to
a poll taken last week by the Omaha World-Herald. According to the
poll, Exon was the choice of 55 percent. Twenty-nine percent said
they would vote for Daub. In an Aug. 28-30 survey this year, Exon
was ahead by 16 points.
   Cindy Daub, meanwhile, released a letter saying there is no
truth to stories that her husband has abused her. She said Exon
should apologize for remarks that she said gave the issue national
prominence.
   The spark that enlivened Nebraska's Senate campaign with issues
of alcohol and spouse abuse came from former Sen. John Tower of
Texas. During an Oct. 11 visit on behalf of Daub, Tower told
reporters that Exon had a reputation as ``one of the two or three
biggest boozers in the Senate.''
   Putnam said Exon should give the Daub campaign and the news
media authorization to check the senator's hospital records,
insurance carrier and Medicare.
   ``Only through a careful examination of insurance records will
the extent of the senator's true medical condition be known to the
public,'' Putnam said.
   Pallesen said Exon released information about his health in an
Oct. 17 letter from his physician in Washington, D.C., Dr. Robert
Krasner. Krasner wrote that Exon underwent gallbladder surgery in
1985 and took prescription painkillers for the condition.
   Once the rumors about Exon had been raised, Daub's personal life
also came under scrutiny.
   Daub, who served four terms in the U.S. House and and ran
unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1988, was asked about a 1978
incident in which he suffered a stab wound in his home. Daub had
said he fell and stabbed himself in the arm but rumors of a
domestic incident persisted.
   After Daub called on Exon to release his medical records, Exon
suggested that Daub release his ``family records,'' a veiled
reference to the domestic rumors.
   In a letter to Exon dated Saturday and addressed to Exon's
Washington office, Mrs. Daub told Exon, ``When you held a news
conference and implied that my husband beat me up which resulted in
me going to so-called shelters, that was the most heinous personal
attack possible and unbecoming of a United States senator.''
   Exon denied attacking the Daubs.
   ``I have made no accusations and spread no rumors about her or
her husband,'' Exon said in a statement.

<HEAD>Moody's Warns Tax Initiatives Threaten Bond Ratings in Six States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tax initiatives in six states could result in
reduced bond ratings at state and local level if passed by voters
in the Nov. 6 election, a Wall Street bond rating agency warned.
   Moody's Investors Service said tax initiatives in Colorado,
Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon and Utah could, if
approved, lower the confidence financial advisers have in those
states.
   ``They do introduce uncertainty,'' said George Leung, a Moody's
analyst. ``This year, I think certainly it's reflective of the mood
- the discontent amongst voters, and also reflective of economic
conditions.''
   Moody's said in a report released last week that the initiatives
``could have serious consequences for state and local governments
and result in reduced bond ratings.''
   ``In all of these states, with the possible exception of Utah,
many questions remain about how the proposals would be
implemented,'' Moody's said in a report last week. It said courts
and state legislatures would probably have to resolve the
ambiguities.
   Bond ratings are used as a guide for investors. Lowered bond
ratings can result in higher interest payments for borrowing.
   Most states back their bonds with the full faith and credit of
the state, making payment of debt the highest spending priority.
   Financially ailing Massachusetts already has the lowest bond
rating in the country. Bond rating agencies have warned that
passage of a proposal to roll back certain taxes and fees there to
1988 levels could drop the state's rating from its current level of
Baa to junk bond status.
   In Colorado and Oregon, the tax initiatives set more restrictive
limits on property taxes, other revenue sources and municipal debt.
   In Montana, the initiative would replace all sales, income and
property taxes with a trade charge on business and financial
transactions.
   One Nebraska initiative would impose a cap on annual expenditure
growth while another would change the manner in which schools are
funded. The Utah initiative would remove some items from the sales
tax base.
   Moody's warned that municipal bond ratings also could also
suffer if the initiatives pass.
   ``If Montana's initiative succeeds, all ratings in the state
would immediately be placed under review because the measure calls
for a massive restructuring of state and local revenues for both
operations and debt service,'' Moody's said.
   Montana and Oregon currently have ratings of Aa and Utah has a
rating of Aaa on general obligation bonds, which are backed by the
state's full faith and credit. Moody's does not have a general
obligation bond rating for either Colorado and Nebraska, because
the states do not issues such bonds, Leung said.
   The Massachusetts initiative would reduce the personal income
tax rate, eliminating a surcharge collected in fiscal 1990 and
1991, and would roll back other state taxes to their August, 1989
levels.
   If it passes, the initiative will cost the state an estimated
$1.28 billion in 1991 and $2.55 billion the following year.
   Opponents of the Citizens for Limited Taxation proposal in
Massachusetts have argued the measure would gut state government
programs.
   Howard Foley, president of the Massachusetts High Tech Council,
a 200-company business association that co-sponsored the CLT
petition, said the warning should have come two years ago, when the
state's bond rating was still high.
   ``I think the biggest problem is the continuing overspending of
what we don't have,'' Foley said when asked about the prospect of a
bond rating reduction. ``Perhaps if that option wasn't available,
we'd pay more attention to balancing our books.''

that the troubled sequel to the Corleone family saga would not come
out this year.
   After a weekend screening of an unfinished print of the last
chapter in writer-director Francis Ford Coppola's trilogy, senior
Paramount executives elected to release the film Dec. 25 to
approximately 1,800 theaters nationwide.
   ``The Godfather Part III'' originally was to open Thanksgiving,
but a variety of production delays forced its postponement. The
first two installments in the trilogy won nine Academy Awards and
grossed $800 million. The latest film, expected to cost about $50
million, is the most anticipated holiday release.
   The sequel, which picks up the Corleone family two decades after
1974's ``The Godfather Part II'' left off, stars Al Pacino, Diane
Keaton, Andy Garcia and Coppola's own daughter, Sofia. In the film,
Don Corleone (Pacino) attempts to legitimize his family's
investment businesses, which once hinged on gambling.
   The original ``Godfather'' opened in 1972.
   In a statement, Coppola said: ``After one of the most intensive
production schedules in my career, I am deeply satisfied that `The
Godfather Part III' has come together in a way that gives me great
pride.''

   The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling
involving black voters' rights that forces Norfolk, Va., to change
the way city council members are elected.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by city officials
on a ruling that the at-large system used since 1918 in city
council elections violates black voters' rights.
   At the same time, the justices left intact the way Sagauche
County, Colo, elects its governing board despite claims by Hispanic
residents who say their political clout is being blunted illegally.
   The court also asked the Bush administration for its views of an
appeal by a rural Arkansas county's black voters who say the
election system used in party primaries and countywide general
elections is racially biased.
   In the Norfolk case, a federal appeals court panel ordered the
city to switch to a single-district election system that will
``remedy the vote dilution arising out of the at-large election
system.''
   The Norfolk City Council has seven members, elected to staggered
four-year terms. Elections for three or four of the council seats
are held every two years. Candidates with the most votes citywide
win, and do not need a majority of the votes cast.
   A group of black voters and the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People sued in 1983,
contending that the at-large system illegally blunted the political
clout of black voters.
   Norfolk, one of Virginia's largest cities, is 35 percent black
in population. Blacks also comprise 35 percent of the city's
registered voters.
   The city council did not have a black member until 1968, and
since then has had one black member most years.
   The NAACP and black voters who sued said if city council members
were elected from seven single-member districts, black voters would
be in the majority in three of the seven districts.
   The Colorado case centered on how Saguache County's three
commissioners are elected. No Hispanic has ever won a contested
election in the county even though Hispanics comprise 41 percent of
the population.
   The three commissioners must reside in different districts, but
elections are countywide and not confined to the district in which
a candidate resides.
   The still-pending Arkansas case involves a law under which a
candidate for a political party's nomination or for a countywide
office must get a majority of the votes cast.
   If no candidate wins an outright majority, a runoff election is
held two weeks later between the top two vote-getters.
   The justices were told that Arkansas is one of 10 states
employing such a system, ``all of them in the South and all of them
with a long history of purposeful racial vote dilution.''
   The other states were identified as Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and
Oklahoma.
   The runoff system, as it operates in Phillips County, Ark., was
challenged as illegal by black voters who say their voting power is
being diluted.
   Blacks comprise 47 percent of the voting-age population in
Phillips County, but no black candidate in modern times has
received the Democratic or Republican nomination for, or been
elected to, any countywide office.
   The Justice Department in August sued to overturn Georgia's
majority vote runoff system, saying it has ``a chilling effect on
black political participation.''
   Some political observers say eliminating runoffs could help
Republicans in the South and Southwest. Blacks and Hispanics would
win more Democratic primaries, they say, only to lose general
elections to GOP candidates backed by white voters who had
supported white Democratic primary candidates.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top educator on Monday said the country
needs a ``national education index'' to serve as a benchmark for
tates to measure student achievement and pinpoint failing schools
or ineffective local leaders.
   Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, insisted during a ``Fortune'' magazine
seminar of businessmen, educators and governors that the nation is
``more than ready for a national policy in education.''
   ``The message - it seems to me - is absolutely clear. After
years of vigorously defending local school control, the nation is
now supporting - indeed almost demanding - national leadership in
education, while still maintaining vitality at the local level.
   ``It's time to go beyond goals - important as they are - and
begin to talk more precisely about education standards and how
progress toward national objectives can be measured.''
   State must have clearly defined goals, an assessment procedure
requiring annual progress reports from schools, and clearly defined
methods of intervention in case a school is failing, he said.
   As part of intervention, Boyer said a state might put a school
on probation or assign a senior adviser to the school who would
spend time working with teachers, counselors and administrators.
The state also should be given the authority to remove a principal,
superintendent or even a local school board.
   A state might even close a school - ``a strategy of last
resort,'' he said.
   ``Local school control is crucial, but it's insufficient. In the
end, students must be served, and if a school, for whatever reason,
does not provide an effective education, state officials have both
a legal and moral obligation to intervene,'' said Boyer.
   The index also should include:
   -School completion rates of students in every state. This
category would include a look at each student's proficiency in
English and mathematics, performance on general knowledge tests and
whether a state gives priority to writing.
   -The condition of teaching. States would be judged on whether
they have a plan for attracting outstanding students into teaching,
special strategies to attract teachers in math and science and
requirements for training that include sabbaticals, fellowships and
teacher institutes. Teacher salaries also would be considered.
   -The schools' climate as it relates to the quality of buildings,
classrooms and laboratories, as well as class size.
   -Financial support of schools. States' per-student expenditures
and other costs would be compared regionally so that cost-of-living
can be considered. Equity in school finance would be a key
consideration.
   -How schools are governed. States must have clearly defined
goals, as well as intervention methods in case of a failing school.
   Boyer sidestepped the issue of who should be in charge of the
national evaluation of school performance, noting that both
Congress and the National Governors' Association have been haggling
over the issue. The NGA has set up a special board to handle the
task and Congress has passed two bills creating panels.

<HEAD>Government Trust Plummets to 6 Percent in Soviet Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than one in 10 Soviet respondents in a new
poll expressed full support for their leaders and half said they
had no confidence at all.
   The poll by the independent All-Union Center for Public Opinion
indicated that support for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his
government, headed by Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, has hit the
lowest point since Gorbachev took power in 1985.
   The poll, released by the independent news service Interfax,
found only 6 percent of respondents gave full support when asked,
``How much do you trust the national leadership now?''
   Thirty-two percent expressed qualified support and 50 percent
had no confidence at all. The rest had no opinion, Interfax
reported.
   The results were based on answers by 1,356 people in 11 regions
across the country, Interfax said. However, it gave no margin of
error and didn't say when the survey was done. There was no answer
to phone queries at the center late Monday.
   A pol conducted last summer by the liberal weekly Ogonyok put
support for Gorbachev's Communist Party at 30 percent, below the
Red Army, the Russian Orthodox Church and the national Supreme
Soviet legislature.
   The latest poll was released two weeks after Gorbachev was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for helping end the Cold War. In
contrast to his worldwide popularity, Gorbachev's domestic standing
has been sliding for years, even more severely the last year as
shortages have worsened and nearly all the 15 republics have
declared some form of sovereignty.
   The poll also asked whether the emergency powers given to
Gorbachev by the Supreme Soviet last month will ``help stabilize
the country's economy.''
   More than half - 54 percent - said they doubted the presidential
decrees would have a significant effect. Nearly one-fifth said they
thought the powers would help, and the remainder had no comment.
   Gorbachev has issued about a half-dozen decrees so far,
including ordering a crackdown on black marketeers and demanding
that state-run manufacturers and suppliers fulfill their contracts
with state-run businesses. Officials have accused ``speculators''
of siphoning off the supplies for resale at high prices on the
black market.
   A majority of respondents also said they expected open
hostilities to break out in the Gulf, although only 2 percent
thought fighting would escalate into a Third World War with the
United States, Interfax reported.
   Fifteen percent were optimistic that a peaceful settlement could
be reached, and 23 percent expressed no opinion, it said.

<HEAD>No Bond For Escapee Accused Of Killing Girl Found Under Bed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prison escapee charged with raping and murdering
a little girl found dying in a laundry bag under his bed is a
``clear and present danger,'' a judge said Monday in ordering him
held without bond.
   Alcides Quiles, 27, faces charges of first-degree murder,
kidnapping and sexual assault in the apparent strangling Sunday of
Joanna Noda, who would have turned 2 years old Wednesday.
   The victim was found the second time police searched Quiles'
quarters.
   ``He took the police into his apartment not once, but twice,''
marveled Detective Ronnie Ilhardt. ``And he sat right there while
they were looking. But when the body was found, he ran out the
door.''
   Three years ago in Hartford, Conn., Quiles was charged with
raping a 6-year-old friend of his son, leaving the boy beaten
bloody and unconscious in the snow. The resulting publicity led two
women, one of whom was stabbed in a robbery the same day, to
identify him as their assailant as well.
   Quiles was sentenced to 18 years in those cases, but escaped in
August by climbing over a fence topped with razor wire at a
minimum-security prison in Enfield, Conn. He had been transferred
to the prison in June, two years after he was sentenced.
   He made his way to Miami and rented a room under an assumed
name, police said.
   He appeared Monday before Dade County Judge Murray Meyerson, and
was quickly denied bond on the murder charge.
   ``This court finds you are a clear and present danger,'' the
judge said. ``To protect the community, you will remain in custody.
No bond for you, Mr. Quiles.''
   Joanna disappeared Sunday morning, triggering a frantic search
by neighbors and police in her family's working-class neighborhood.
   Quiles watched the search from his doorway across a fence from
the Noda home, and told her family that Joanna was bound to turn
up, said her cousin Tanya Lopez.
   ``He said, `She's not in here. You can check if you want,'''
said Tanya, who helped in the search. ``And she was under the bed -
she was dead under the bed.''
   Police were approached during the search by a woman who said she
had seen a man running down the street after the little girl.
   Joanna's father had apparently left a yard gate open when he
rushed into his house to answer the telephone. Joanna then left the
house and slipped through the gate to chase a chicken down the
street.
   The woman witness told police that Quiles chased Joanna in what
appeared to be an attempt to keep her from running into the street,
but then took the little girl's hand, according to the police
report. After talking to the woman, investigators returned to
interview Quiles again.
   Quiles told police a bag they spotted under his bed contained
dirty laundry, but the officers decided to check it.
   After Quiles fled when the body was found, he was caught after a
short chase. Joanna was still breathing when found, but was
pronounced dead shortly afterward at Jackson Memorial Hospital.
   Joanna's father, Rolando Noda, grabbed his shotgun and ran
toward the police car where Quiles sat handcuffed after his arrest,
but an officer stopped him and persuaded him to put the gun away.
   ``I was blind with rage,'' Noda said later.
   Joanna's sister, Mary Cecilia Noda, 7, said she could not
understand the death.
   ``I feel bad. I don't know, I just feel like doing something to
that man for what he did to my sister,'' she said.
   Connecticut authorities made a formal request for his
extradition Monday, but prosecutors said any such action would wait
until after Quiles' trial here.

   Parliament on Monday unanimously voted
to strike out any reference to the Warsaw Pact in its defense law,
state radio said.
   The unicameral legislature also agreed to lower the term of
military service for draftees from 18 months to 12 months, and make
corresponding cuts for those opting for ``unarmed military
service,'' or civilian service.
   Hungarian politicans serving in the nation's first
democratically elected government in more than four decades have
served notice that they intend to pull out of the alliance, Soviet
led before the wave of democracy ended East Europe's communist era.
   As in Czechoslovakia, Soviet troops stationed for decades are in
the process of pulling out. Hungary plans to reduce its own armed
forces by more than 30 percent after the initialing of a Warsaw
Pact-NATO deal later this year on cutting conventional weapons.

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old high school student held
a classmate hostage at gunpoint Monday after taking over a
classroom and then freeing his teacher and five other students,
officials said.
   The student, Eli Dean, made no demands and fired no shots.
Negotiators were communicating with him over the school's intercom
system, said state police Sgt. Marvin Jenkins.
   ``The important thing is we don't want anybody injured and we
don't think he does either,'' Jenkins said.
   The rest of the 643-student school was evacuated onto the school
football field.
   Hostage negotiators were at the school, and two state police
chaplains were flown in. Members of Dean's family also were
present, including his father, Robin, a civilian employee of the
state police.
   Jenkins said snipers were positioned around the school, but that
officials were keepings their options open.
   ``We're not making a move ... We're not in any great rush to do
things,'' he said.
   The student, a senior, had been suspended from school twice
during the past two weeks. He returned to the school late Monday
morning with a handgun, officials said.
   Dean let his teacher leave first, and then later let most of the
students go.
   The youth's stepfather, Rocky Williams of Charlestown, said he
believed Dean had taken his .44-calibre pistol to the school. State
police said they did not know what type of weapon the boy had.
   Williams said his stepson was suspended about two weeks ago
after he accidentally set off a fire alarm. He was suspended again
last week for breaking a window, Williams said.
   ``He was falling behind in his school work and was upset,'' his
stepfather said.
   Police refused to speculate on Dean's motives.
   ``Maybe the fact that he's 17 years old is as much reason as
anything,'' Jenkins said.

<HEAD>Cuba Releases Document on the 1962 Missile Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cuban government Monday released a
document on the 1962 missile crisis and reiterated its bitterness
over the Soviet decision 28 years ago to remove the missiles
without consulting with Cuba.
   The government news agency Prensa Latina, in a dispatch
monitored in Mexico City, ran a description of the events it said
was culled from a 200-page secret document that Fidel Castro's
government just released.
   ``Twenty-eight years after the October Crisis that pushed the
world to the brink of nuclear war, the Cubans maintain their claims
from the era and reproach Nikita Khrushchev for having exluded them
from secret conversations,'' the article begins.
   There appeared to be little new in the document, and its release
seemed to be in the nature of nursing an old grudge at a time when
relations between the Soviet Union and Cuba have hit a
post-revolutionary low.
   Although the Soviet Union is still providing aid to Cuba, the
Soviet press recently has published a series of revealing,
unflattering reports, including a rare portrait of Castro's
personal life that said he has 32 houses, a security contingent of
9,700 and five children by his ``present wife.''
   Cuba has dedicated a new monument on the launch site for the
rocket that shot down an American spy plane during the crisis,
Prensa Latina reported in a separate dispatch Monday.
   The monument contains a rock wall surrounded by palm trees,
symbolizing the decision of Cubans to defend their territory, it
said.
   In the summer of 1962, the Soviet Union began installing 42
medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba. U.S. spy planes detected the
missiles, and the United States began a naval blockade of Cuba.
Tensions peaked when Cuba shot down a U-2 spy plane on Oct. 27;
Khrushchev submitted to President Kennedy's demand the missiles be
withdrawn.
   In newly released excerpts of his memoirs, Khrushchev called
Castro a ``hothead'' who wanted the Soviet Union to attack the
United States during the crisis. Castro denied that story.
   The document released Monday said the Soviet Union had sent a
delegation to Havana in May 1962 to discuss installing the weapons
as a means of discouraging the United States from attacking the
island.
   Cuba accepted the plan in June after a meeting of the political
leadership, including Castro, his brother Raul Castro, Ernesto
``Che'' Guevara, Osvaldo Dorticos, Blas Roca and Emilio Aaragones,
it said.
   The weapons, medium-range R-12 missiles, began arriving after
Raul Castro visited Moscow in July and signed a secret agreement,
according to the report.
   About 43,000 Soviet soldiers, officers and specialists were sent
to Cuba in connection with the deployment, it said.
   The Soviet general in charge and his second-in-command had
orders to use the missiles ``only in case of aggression by the
United States and only under orders from Moscow,'' the report said.
   The document, whose origins and author weren't specified,
expressed bitterness at Khrushchev's neglecting to warn Castro of
his decision to pull back the missiles.
   ``Since the missiles had been installed under a military
agreement between the Soviet Union and Cuba, it is totally normal
that, if something changed, both sides be consulted,'' the report
said.
   ``Even if the hypothesis of lack of time is accepted as the
cause for Cuba not having been consulted, Khrushchev's answer to
Kennedy could have been: `We are in agreement with removing the
rockets if the Cubans' demands for security are satisfied and, of
course, if they participate in the negotiations,''' it added.
   Kennedy pledged in a secret agreement that the United States
would not attack Cuba. But Castro said the guarantee was
insufficient unless accompanied by withdrawal of naval and economic
blockades, an end to CIA-funded harassment, and closure of the U.S.
navy base at Guantanamo.
   ``Today, 28 years after the crisis, the .. points expressed by
Fidel Castro still apply. The Cuban-U.S. conflict is not
resolved,'' Prensa Latina said.

<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts has
quietly dropped a controversial requirement that grant recipients
sign a non-obscenity pledge, now that Congress has voted to scrap
explicit restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for federal
subsidies.
   The pledge, instituted by endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer
late last year, has spawned three federal lawsuits charging that it
violated the Constitution's free-speech guarantees.
   At last count, 16 artists and arts institutions refused to sign
the pledge and forfeited more than $318,000 in endowment grants
last year.
   The endowment made no formal announcement of Monday's action,
but agency officials confirmed that the pledge had been withdrawn
and would not be required as a condition of receiving grants for
the 1991 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
   These officials would not permit use of their names.
   Last year, Frohnmayer ordered all grant recipients to promise in
writing they would not violate a congressional ban against
endowment support for works that ``may be considered obscene,''
including depictions of homosexual or sadomasochistic activities,
sexual exploitation of children or ``individuals engaged in sex
acts.''
   Endowment officials said they did not know if the pledge
covering last year's grant recipients would be repealed
retroactively.
   If last year's grant recipients are still bound by the pledge,
said constitutional lawyer Floyd Abrams, he will continue to press
his lawsuit against the endowment on behalf of the New School for
Social Research, which is challenging the non-obscenity pledge in
U.S. District Court in New York City.
   ``It is hard to believe the NEA would persist in a policy so
plainly rejected by Congress for the future,'' Abrams said in a
telephone interview from New York.
   ``If they insist on requiring this oath for fiscal 1990
(grants), an ultimate judicial resolution will be required,''
Abrams said.
   Shortly before it adjourned last weekend, Congress junked the
obscenity ban it imposed on the arts endowment a year ago and voted
instead to leave judgments of obscenity to the courts.
   The proposed new law awaiting President Bush's signature would
require the endowment to recoup its grant money from any recipient
who is later convicted of violating obscenity laws.
   The bill omits any explicit obscenity restrictions, saying only
that obscenity lacks artistic merit, is not protected speech under
the Constitution and ``shall not be funded'' by the endowment.
   The measure does require that grant awards take into
consideration ``general standards of decency and respect for the
diverse beliefs and values of the American public.''
   The bill also extends the endowment's statutory authority for
three years, with a first-year budget of $175 million, a $4 million
increase over last year's current spending. It approves a
Republican-backed request that the state share of endowment grant
money be increased from 20 percent to 35 percent over three years.
   The National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, a non-profit
lobbying organization representing artists and arts supporters,
denounced the new proposed law as a ``more insidious form of
censorship'' than the old obscenity ban.
   Joy Silverman, acting director of the group, said the bill would
transform the endowment chairman into ``the federal government's
primary arts censor,'' stifle artistic creativity and foster
``official art.''
   ``The new mandate of this NEA will be not to support art, but
rather to ensure no one is offended by art,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has settled an American
businessman's lawsuit with an undisclosed sum and acknowledgement
that an allegation he was a spy was based on ``past
misunderstandings.''
   An attorney for Palo Alto businessman Raphael Gregorian said
Monday the atmosphere of perestroika, or openness, in the Soviet
Union helped resolve the bitter international dispute.
   Attorney Jerry Kroll said both sides agreed to keep their
financial agreement confidential.
   A settlement agreement, approved by U.S. District Judge David
Kenyon last week and delivered to atorneys Monday, said ``the
parties wish amicably to put an end to the disputes between them
arisen from past misunderstandings ...''
   Kroll said that language was critical to Gregorian, who believes
it absolves him of Soviet accusations that he was a spy.
   Gregorian ran a $10-million-a-year business selling medical
equipment in the Soviet Union until he was ousted from the country
in 1984 amid allegations printed in the newspaper Izvestia that he
was a spy. The Soviets refused to return or pay for medical
equipment Gregorian left behind when he was forced out.
   In a unique legal move, he sued Izvestia for libel and the
Soviet government for breach of contract. He contended the timing
of his ouster indicated it was retaliation for the U.S. arrests of
Svetlana and Nikolay Ogorodnikov in a spy case involving former FBI
agent Richard W. Miller.
   The lawsuit took a colorful path through the courts with
Gregorian first winning by default when the Soviets failed to
respond. When Kroll began seizing Soviet assets in the United
States to satisfy a $463,000 judgment in Gregorian's behalf, the
Soviets hired attorneys to fight back.
   The Soviets were backed by the U.S. State Department, which said
Gregorian couldn't sue the Soviet Union because of the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act.
   Eventually, Kenyon dismissed libel portions of the case, but
ruled the Soviets owed Gregorian $163,165 for the medical equipment
left in Moscow. An appeals court reversed that decision and sent
the case back to Kenyon in 1989 for a new trial.
   The settlement precludes any new trial.
   ``I'm very pleased about the outcome,'' Kroll said. ``Just the
fact that they admit it was a misunderstanding clears my client's
good name.''
   He said the seeds of the settlement were planted when he met
last year with Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   He subsequently met with Soviet Vice Consul Oleg Tischenko in
San Francisco, taking with him a copy of Gorbachev's book
``Perestroika.''
   ``I pulled out the book and said `I read your boss' book and I
think what we're doing in this case is inconsistent with
perestroika,''' Kroll said. ``He seemed to agree.''
   He said Gregorian had put his life on hold while the lawsuits
were pending.
   ``He's glad that his name has been cleared,'' Kroll said. ``He's
now working on other business opportunities.''

<TEXT>
   About 120,000 Israelis called a general strike
Monday that the workers hope will silence radio and television,
halt trains and planes, stop mail delivery and paralyze the
operations of government offices.
   The strike, called by unions of engineers, technicians and
academics, will start Tuesday and continue indefinitely until wage
demands are met.
   The unions are demanding that wage agreements reached with the
public sector include employees of government-owned companies,
while the Finance Ministry wants the two kept separate.
   The unions also demand the Finance Ministry drop a move to cut
extras and want increased pension funds.
   It was unclear as to exact numbers and what percent of an
increase the unions wanted.
   The Finance Ministry insisted government companies already in
the red could not afford to pay employees more. Yaakov Danon, head
of the wage division at the Ministry, said the unions' demands
could not be met.
   Many government-owned companies have fallen into debt this past
year and tough layoffs have created much discontent.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose
parliamentary majority is usually as faithful as Lassie herself,
srvived a dogfight Monday night in the House of Commons to defeat
a measure for stray canines.
   Legislators voted 274 to 271 to reject a compulsory dog
registration plan aimed at dealing with an estimated half-million
abandoned dogs who roam and foul the streets.
   The compulsory plan by the opposition Labor Party and animal
welfare groups was aimed at registering Britain's 7 million dog
owners and tagging the animals.
   The vote drew intense interest in Britain, a nation of animal
lovers.
   Government ministers bitterly opposed the plan, proposing
instead to raise fines and give more powers to local authorities to
pursue offenders. But large numbers of lawmakers from Mrs.
Thatcher's Conservative Party supported the measure. Mrs. Thatcher
usually enjoys a 100-vote margin in Commons.
   Traditional British reserve went to the dogs as the two sides
duked it out.
   ``The debate could have taken place only in this country, and in
a nation reared on Greyfriars Bobby and Thomas Hardy's dog
Wessex,'' The Times wrote in an editorial.
   On Monday, the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals
placed a graphic full-page ad in The Daily Telegraph. It showed a
mountain of dead dogs over the message: ``Registration is better
than extermination.''
   In April, the pro-registration forces narrowly lost a Commons
vote in favor of compulsory registration. In the biggest revolt of
this Parliament by Conservative lawmakers, 50 of them defied their
leaders to vote with the opposition and 46 abstained.
   The government's hundred-vote majority shrank that night to 12.
   Then, on Oct. 23, the unelected House of Lords voted to
incorporate a national registration plan into the Environment
Protection Bill. After Monday's vote, the bill will go back to the
House of Lords for a final vote.
   The dog-registration crusade was led by one of Mrs. Thatcher's
own partisans, Dame Janet Fookes, who has championed it for 15
years.
   An estimated half-million abandoned dogs roam and foul the
streets of Britain. The dog-registration campaign gained urgency
from several well-publicized incidents in which children were
mauled.
   According to recent polls by the Royal Society for the
Protection of Animals, 94 percent of people who are aware of the
dog registration issue support it, and 84 percent of local
authorities favor some form of compulsory registration.
   Police, farmers, vets, and other major organizations directly
with dog welfare and control have also backed registration.
   ``I think the government is in danger of losing it,'' Dame Janet
said of Monday's vote.
   In 1988, the government abolished dog licenses costing less than
a dollar, arguing that the fees cost more to collect than they
raised in revenue.
   Dame Janet said that program was ineffective anyway. She
advocates the registration of both dog and owner for an initial fee
of around $38.
   The funds raised would finance a national warden system. Dogs
would be marked with tattoos or microchip implants for easy
identification.
   Government ministers say registration would be ignored by the
dog owners who now cause the problems, and the fee would be just
another burden on the poor.
   Government proposals include transferring responsibility for
rounding up strays from police to local councils, fining owners for
dogs without collars and identity tags, and creating a specific
offense of letting a dog stray.

   Police and Islamic fundamentalists
exchanged tear gas and firebombs Monday in a running battle in the
center of the Tunisian capital, witnesses said. There were no
injuries reported.
   The demonstration by 300 members of the banned Islamic movement
An-Nahda appeared aimed at the release of a leader, Ali Larridh,
arrested Saturday for holding a meeting not permitted by law.
   Police arrested several demonstrators after dispersing them with
tear gas, witnesses said. The protesters first hurled stones and
then crude firebombs at police cars, setting one ablaze.
   It was the first reported use of the gasoline-filled bottles in
weeks of clashes between police and the fundamentalists, who wish
to be allowed to run for public office.

   The city police chief says an internal
investigation will precede any request to involve state law
enforcement officers in the case of three female dancers who
wrestled nude in gelatin at a police night spot.
   The dancers entertained Saturday at the Police Club, which was
being used by a separate, unrelated organization.
   Police Chief Charles Austin said the outcome of the internal
investigation will determine whether he will ask State Law
Enforcement Division to decide if any obscenity laws were violated.
   Austin said he also will conduct an internal investigation to
see if any police had prior knowledge that nudity would be part of
the entertainment when the Police Club was rented by an
organization called the Men's Luncheon Society.
   ``If anyone on the force had prior knowledge, then I have a
serious problem with that,'' Austin said.
   A member of the society who attended the party, Hayne Hasell,
said about 200 men watched the gelatin wrestling.
   The Police Club is operated by a private organization of the
same name made up of Columbia police personnel.
   Austin said an organization with as much visibility as the
Police Club ought to have guidelines to make sure its facilities
are used properly.
   He said he never has been a member of the Police Club, but does
approve of the group.
   ``That's the sad part about this,'' Austin said. ``It's a very
legitimate group. Those guys have done a lot of good, such as
having Christmas parties for kids.''
   The Men's Luncheon Society is not connected with the Police
Club, City Manager Miles Hadley said. He said a police officer's
brother reserved the facility for the group.

   The Security Council voted Monday to hold
Saddam Hussein's regime liable for human rights abuses and war
damages during its 3-month-old occupation of Kuwait.
   The vote was 13-0, with abstentions by Cuba and Yemen. It was
the 10th resolution condemning Iraq since Saddam's troops overran
Kuwait on Aug. 2, and it warned of unspecified further action if
Iraq does not obey the council.
   Senior military officers from the five permanent Security
Council members met to discuss implementation of the sanctions, but
the meeting ended early in the evening and no statement was issued.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering delivered a warning of
possible independent U.S. action.
   ``It is the solemn duty of every state to protect its citizens.
My government takes this responsibility most seriously,'' Pickering
said in his council speech. ``We join the council in this demand
and we urge the government of Iraq to comply. But I want to
underscore one point. ... The United States will do that which is
necessary to meet its obligation to its own citizens.''
   Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations,
rejected the resolution. He said the Security Council was applying
a double standard in dealing more harshly with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait than with Israel's occupation of Arab territories.
   Pickering said the Iraqi speech was ``the greatest pack of
distortions, lies and bizarre tales that I have ever seen. It was
like bringing the fox in to advise on how to guard the henhouse.''
   The resolution also demands that Iraq allow foreign governments
to send supplies to their diplomats in occupied Kuwait City. The
United States and Britain are the only Western nations with
embassies still operating in Kuwait.
   The resolution, which cites violations of the Fourth Geneva
Convention, also hints at a future war crimes inquiry. There was no
specific mention of a tribunal or reparations.
   The resolution did not establish a mechanism for collecting
compensation, but said all states should assemble information about
losses of life, injury and torture, loss of revenue, damage and
loss of property.
   The military meeting, the highest-level in many years at the
United Nations, included Lt. Gen. Michael Carns, director of the
Joint Staff of the United States, and Col.-Gen. Bronislav A.
Omelichev, first deputy chief of the Soviet Army.
   The Soviet Union consistently has sought revival of the Security
Council's Military StaffCommittee, and has said it only would join
an international military action in the gulf under a U.N. umbrella.
   During the Security Council meeting Monday, Ethiopia's envoy
declared: ``Iraq shall be held accountable and, indeed, responsible
for the lawlessness of its occupation forces and face the attendant
consequences.''
   Ambassador Tesfaye Tadesse told the council, on behalf of the
Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of African Unity, that
Iraq has refused to comply with the will of the international
community. ``There is not the slightest indication from Baghdad of
any change of heart,'' he said.
   The council is left with no choice, he said, ``but to send a
message that the unity and resolve of the council to end the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait is as strong as ever.''
   The resolution demands that Iraqi forces stop mistreating and
oppressing Kuwaiti and other nationals.
   It demands that Iraq ensure immediate access to food, water and
basic services for Kuwaiti nationals and foreigners in Kuwait and
Iraq, including diplomatic missions in Kuwait.
   Western diplomats said privately that this could be the last
resolution exhorting Iraq to obey its resolutions and indicated the
council would adopt a more action-oriented posture.
   The council has been acting under Chapter 7 which provides for
Security Council sanctions and even collective military action
against member states which threaten international peace and
security.
   The council already has invoked Article 41 but has not exhausted
its non-military provisions, which include interruption of economic
relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio and
other means of communication.
   Article 42, the next step envisoned by some members, calls for
``such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to
maintain or restore international peace and security, (including)
demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land
forces of members of the United Nations.''
   The Security Council includes the five permanent members with
veto power: the United States, Britain, China, France and the
Soviet Union; and 10 non-permanent members: Canada, Colombia, Cuba,
Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen, Zaire.

   A returning French captive on Monday urged the
United States and Britain to do something for their hostages in
Iraq and Kuwait, because they are ``in very bad shape.''
   ``Please take them away. They cannot carry on much longer,''
said the woman, one of 263 French hostages and 19 other Westerners
who flew to freedom on an Iraqi Airways jet.
   Also on board were the last seven diplomats from the besieged
French Embassy in Kuwait.
   ``We want to tell the United States and Britain to do something
for their hostages. They are in very bad shape,'' the French woman
said. She spoke on condition of anonymity at Baghdad airport.
   The chartered Boeing 747 arrived at midnight at Charles de
Gaulle-Roissy airport. Most of those aboard were males, clad in
T-shirts and business suits.
   A former hostage in Kuwait who identified himself as Father
Sanchez said conditions were especially difficult for Western
captives held at strategic sites to ward off military attack.
   ``They are never free, never able to walk around,'' he said.
``There are ready to crack.''
   Of his own captivity, he said: ``Three years like that and I
would die.''
   Other hostages said Iraqi troops in Kuwait were gradually
crushing the Kuwaiti resistance and that sounds of gunfire
indicating clashes have grown less and less frequent.
   About 60 French citizens also believed to have been in Iraq and
Kuwait were not on board. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said some
chose to stay behind and others may have managed to leave on their
own.
   Isabelle Renior, the Foreign Ministry officer in charge of the
hostage case, said that one French citizen of Italian oriigin was
prevented from leaving Iraq but had no further details.
   ``I can say now that all French citizens who wanted to go home
have gone home,'' said Andre Janier, the French charge d'affaires
in Iraq.
   Baghdad announced last week that it would allow all French
hostages to leave. The move was widely interpreted as an effort to
split the international alliance against Saddam Hussein.
   France has stressed that it did not negotiate for the freedom of
its citizens, and has demanded that all foreign hostages be freed.
   ``I express the joy of all the French people to those coming
home,'' President Francois Mitterrand said. ``But we will rejoice
fully only when the other hostages can return to their own
countries.''
   The Iraqi Airways plane picked up evacuees in Kuwait City in the
early afternoon before flying to Baghdad, where hundreds of
hostages celebrated with beer and whiskey as the plane landed.
   Nine Greeks, four Britons, two Filipinos, one German and one
Spaniard were also on board, officials at the Baghdad airport said.
   About 2,000 journalists and relatives cheered the aircraft's
arrival in Paris. Authorities closed one of the two main terminals,
forcing dozens of scheduled flights to reroute.
   Mitterrand spoke at a joint news conference with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev after signing a cooperation
agreement between the two countries.
   Gorbachev said U.N. sanctions against Iraq should be
intensified, and suggested that Saddam is beginning to yield to
economic pressure. He also said Saddam would be making a mistake if
he expected a split in the international alliance against him.
   ``I think it's unacceptable to have a military solution, but
President Hussein should not indulge in speculation,'' Gorbachev
said.
   ``We want to do step by step everything that ensures that sound
logic prevails, and you can't call what they (Iraq) have done
anything other than adventurism.''
   Gorbachev said Saddam's position may have shifted, and suggested
he might be receptive to a new inter-Arab initiative, possibly led
by Saudi Arabia.

   Harvard University said Monday it will
sponsor the annual international AIDS conference in 1992, four
months after threatening to cancel the forum unless the United
States removed travel restrictions on people infected with AIDS.
   The conference, the principal forum for presenting scientific
information on the fight against the disease, will go ahead in the
last week of May 1992, school officials said.
   In June, the Harvard AIDS Institute threatened to withdraw as
sponsor and cancel the conference to protest a U.S. policy making
AIDS infection one of several contagious diseases for which
foreigners could be barred from the country.
   But under a revised immigration bill passed by Congress over the
weekend, Health Secretary Louis Sullivan would have the authority
to remove AIDS and other diseases from the medical list for which a
person may be denied entry.
   Sullivan has repeatedly said there is no reason to exclude
people with AIDS, because the disease is not passed casually, but
only by exchanes of blood or body fluids or by sexual contact.
   The measure went to President Bush, who has indicated he will
sign it as early as this week.
   The conference is expected to attract about 15,000 researchers,
policy makers, community organizers and AIDS patients, Harvard
officials said.

   A sharply divided state Republican Party
scrambled Monday to pick a new gubernatorial candidate after Jon
Grunseth stepped down because of allegations of sexual misconduct.
   With just eight days before the election, Sept. 11 primary
runner-up Arne Carlsn hopes to parlay his week-old write-in
campaign into the GOP ballot spot. Leaders of the party's ruling
conservative faction balk at that, believing that Carlson is too
liberal.
   But with time so short, some in the anti-Carlson camp agree
their options are limited in their effort to unseat Democratic Gov.
Rudy Perpich.
   ``Pressure is really mounting to go with Arne,'' said Frank
Graves, a member of the Republican National Committee and one of
Carlson's biggest critics.
   ``The thing that really worries me the most is with two liberals
on the ticket (Perpich and Carlson) I'm afraid a lot of
conservatives are going to stay home,'' Graves said. ``If they stay
home it hurts our candidates for constitutional offices and our
legislative candidates.''
   Grunseth withdrew Sunday night, citing ``enormous pressure''
from allegations that he encouraged teen-age girls to swim nude
with him nine years ago and had an affair during both of his
marriages. He has denied the pool-party claims and said the affair
ended before he married his second wife in 1984.
   An Oct. 19-21 poll, conducted after the pool-party allegations,
showed Carlson leading Perpich 51 percent to 41 percent. But Graves
said Monday it's far from a sure thing that Carlson could win a
head-on race against Perpich on Nov. 6.
   Neither Perpich nor his spokesman, Ray Bohn, returned a call
seeking comment Monday. Perpich declined to comment Sunday about
Grunseth's withdrawal.
   A leader of the Republican party's conservative faction, 3rd
Congressional District Chairman Jim Mullin, said a ``certain
number'' of anti-abortion Republicans will vote for Perpich because
Carlson supports legalized abortions and Perpich does not.
   Further complicating the question is the fact that party
officials themselves aren't sure what procedure to use in naming a
replacement for Grunseth. The party's 14-member executive committee
is to meet Tuesday evening to decide whether it has the power to
name a successor.
   Later Monday, Grunseth campaign official Elam Baer said
Grunseth's running mate, Sharon Clark, has decided not to withdraw
and ``as far as we're concerned, she is the Republican candidate
for lieutenant governor.''
   But Secretary of State Joan Growe, the state's chief election
officer, said her office has concluded that Clark is no longer a
candidate.
   ``Our position is if one person on the team withdraws, then the
team no longer exists,'' Growe said.
   Growe said that if the party concludes there is no legal
machinery to pick a new candidate so soon before the election,
state law calls for the primary runner-up - Carlson - to go on the
ballot.
   Graves said he wants the executive committee to name a
candidate, regardless of what legal advice party leaders receive.
   ``I would recommend that we reject any notion of not doing
anything, of not taking any action,'' he said. ``My position is
that the state executive committee should name someone, even if
it's Carlson.''
   But Graves said he will push to have a conservative candidate
named.
   In August, Graves termed Carlson ``not a Republican'' but rather
``an opportunist who changes his views to fit the latest public
opinion polls.''
   ``What I said then was the truth and it remains the truth,''
Graves said Monday. ``Probably the only thing that has changed is
that I probably would prefer to have Arne Carlson in there than
than Rudy Perpich.''
   State GOP Chairwoman Barb Sykora said she's concluded that ``the
only sensible option is the option that looks like we are legally
bound to: Support Arne Carlson to the best of our ability and beat
Rudy Perpich.''
   Carlson said he's confident that party leaders will conclude
that he should be on the ballot. He also said he's trying to reach
out to conservatives to bring them into this campaign. However, he
said he's continuing his write-in effort until the ballot spot is
decided.
   U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, the party's titular leader, has called
for Republicans to unite behind Carlson.
   ``We can't bring a new candidate on at this point,'' said
Boschwitz, who had encouraged Grunseth to step aside and who is
also seeking re-election.
   Growe said Republicans have until 5 p.m. Friday to get a new
candidate on the ballot.

<TEXT>
   The chief government economist on Monday
angrily denied reports that millions of the African country's
citizens face starvation, and said Sudan would refuse relief even
if there was famine.
   Col. Salah al-Deen Karar, chief of the ruling junta's economic
affairs committee, told the official Sudan News Agency: ``We will
never accept any food assistance, even if famine is declared in
Sudan.''
   On Sunday, the military junta leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir, charged that foreigners were spreading false warnings of
famine to make the government look bad.
   ``Sudan is not suffering from any famine in whatever form,''
el-Bashir said. ``Those who speak of famine in Sudan are only
seeking to tarnish and create difficulty for the government.''
   Karar charged that international relief agencies were
``responsible to a great extent'' for Sudan's current shortfall in
grain supplies, because they have bought large quantities of
Sudan's staple sorghum on the open market to feed refugees, he
said.
   This resulted in price increases for sorghum that put it beyond
the means of many Sudanese who otherwise would have been able to
buy food, Karrar said.
   Karar said that if relief organizations want to help the country
and feed people displaced by hunger, ``they should bring their food
from outside Sudan.''
   Witnesses testified in Congress last week that a horrendous
drought is coming to Sudan, and urged the junta to announce a
famine emergency so an international relief operation can proceed.
   Roger Winter, director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a
private group, said famine ``of biblical dimensions'' threatens as
many as 11 million Sudanese.
   Andrew Natsios, the U.S. government's top relief official,
accused el-Bashir's government of being ``increasingly indifferent
if not overtly hostile to the relief efforts.''
   U.S. officials have long accused the government, which seized
power in a military coup 16 months ago, of preventing food from
reaching the south, where rebels have been fighting for autonomy
since 1983.
   Karar said Sudan no longer depends solely on rain-fed projects
but also is banking to a greater extent on lands in central Sudan
irrigated by Nile River water.
   ``A million feddans (acres) of sorghum have been cultivated this
year in the irrigated areas,'' he said. ``This is expected to yield
700,000 tons in addition to the harvest of central Sudan's rain-fed
areas.''
   The foreign press is reporting untrue famine stories to
``demoralize the Sudanese and ridicule the government's slogan `We
eat from what we cultivate,''' Karar said.
   Junta leader el-Bashir acknowledged that Africa's largest
country has food shortages caused by late and insufficient summer
rains. But he claimed the shortfalls will last only until December,
when the winter harvest comes in.
   ``One has to confess about the food gap of which some regions
suffer, mainly North Kordofan and Darfur in the west,'' el-Bashir
said. In the last two months, more than 10,000 people in those
sprawling regions of western Sudan have migrated in search of food
to makeshift camps near Khartoum.
   Relief works here say it is early to speak of devastating
famine. But without a massive relief effort, they say, millions
will be at risk by next spring or summer as this fall's harvest
becomes depleted before the next one is ready.
   The strongman's comments did not quantify the extent of the
current food gap. Speaking to visiting journalists last week,
Agriculture Minister Ahmed Ali Genaif put the grain shortage at a
million tons.
   On Sunday, Sudan News Agency quoted drought-stricken Darfur's
deputy governor as saying: ``The situation is reassuring, and no
famine is imminent as reported by the Western media.''
   The agency also reported that Col. Faisal Medani Mukhtar,
governor of neighboring Kordofan, had disclosed arrangements to
meet an estimated grain shortage of 300,000 tons in his region.
   Mukhtar told the agency that 200,000 tons of sorghum and wheat
already were shipped to Kordofan this month from other parts of
Sudan.

   A 17-year-old high school student held
a teacher and six students at gunpoint in a classroom Monday,
gradually freeing them before surrending to police eight hours
later.
   The student, Eli Dean, made no demands and fired no shots, and
negotiators communicated with him over the school's intercom system
during the standoff, said state police Sgt. Marvin Jenkins.
   Dean, a senior, had been suspended from school twice during the
past two weeks. He returned to the school late Monday morning with
a handgun, officials said.
   The rest of the 643-student school was evacuated onto the school
football field.
   Police said Dean surrendered about 7:20 p.m. EST after releasing
his final hostage, believed to be a male cousin.
   Hostage negotiators were at the school, and two state police
chaplains were flown in. Members of Dean's family also were
present, including his father, Robin, a civilian employee of the
state police.
   Jenkins said snipers had been positioned around the school.
   Dean let his teacher leave first, and then freed the students,
nearly all of them individually.
   The youth's stepfather, Rocky Williams of Charlestown, said he
believed Dean had taken his .44-calibre pistol to the school. State
police said they did not know what type of weapon the boy had.
   Williams said his stepson was suspended about two weeks ago
after he accidentally set off a fire alarm. He was suspended again
last week for breaking a window, Williams said.
   ``He was falling behind in his school work and was upset,'' his
stepfather said.
   Police refused to speculate on Dean's motives.
   ``Maybe the fact that he's 17 years old is as much reason as
anything,'' Jenkins said.

   A jury was seated Monday in a trial to decide who
is the rightful owner of a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver Jack
Ruby used to kill presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.
   The case before Dallas County Probate Judge Robert E. Price
could end 23 years of legal wrangling between Ruby's heirs and
Jules Mayer, a lawyer who knew Ruby and was named executor of the
Dallas nightclub owner's estate.
   But with the twists and turns the case has taken through the
judicial system since Ruby died Jan. 3, 1967, nothing is certain.
   The six-person jury selected Monday was expected to hear opening
statements Tuesday.
   The court is dealing with the questions of how to distribute
Ruby's assets and whether to remove Mayer as executor. Mayer still
practices law at age 82.
   Attorneys for Ruby's brother, Earl, were expected to question
Mayer's ability to handle the estate in light of his advanced age.
Potential jurors were questioned about their views on mandatory
retirement and a person's professional effectiveness beyond a
certain age.
   The most valuable asset in the estate is the .38-caliber Colt
Cobra Ruby used to kill Oswald in the basement of the Dallas City
Jail two days after President Kennedy's assassination here in 1963.
   Ruby was convicted of murder in 1964 and sentenced to die in the
electric chair. A Texas appeals court overturned the conviction in
1966, citing reasons that included failure to move the trial from
Dallas. Ruby died at age 55 before a new trial could be held.
   For years since then, Mayer and Earl Ruby have been fighting
over ownership of the gun Jack Ruby bought for $62.50 in a Dallas
gun shop.
   The gun is stowed in a bank safe deposit box. Mayer estimates it
could bring $125,000 on the collectors' market.
   Whatever its value, Mayer contends money from sale of the gun
should go to pay off Ruby's debts. He says they include the $65,000
it has cost him to handle the estate, including the expense of
fighting Earl Ruby's lawsuits.
   Earl Ruby, of Boca Raton, Fla., who is also acting on behalf of
his sister and a nephew, counters that Mayer is trying to profit
from the estate. He wants the estate liquidated to pay off his
brother's debts and ``wipe the slate clean.''
   He also claims that Jack Ruby gave him deathbed instructions to
tear up the will in which he had named Mayer executor.
   Apart from the coveted gun, the estate consists largely of the
clothes and jewelry Ruby wore when he shot Oswald, and some
personal papers.
   Earl Ruby said Monday that if he loses, he will ``go home and
cry a little bit'' but will not appeal.
   Regardless of the trial's outcome, it's unlikely to be the last
word on the gun matter.
   Last year, the Internal Revenue Service stepped into the case
claiming that Ruby owed $17,000 when he died. That amount, the IRS
said, has grown to $86,010 with interest and penalties. The state
of Texas also claims the estate owes it $1,227 in back taxes.
   Earl Ruby says the IRS sacrificed any claim by waiting 22 years
to act on it. Price has set a trial for February to hear the IRS
claim.

<HEAD>Immigration Bill A Boon To Irish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of illegal Irish immigrants in New
England, New York and other places will have the chance to become
legal citizens under provisions of an immigration bill awaiting
President Bush's signature.
   In all, the bill could provide more than 80,000 permanent
residency visas to Irish immigrants by the turn of the century.
That's roughly double the number of Irish visas granted throughout
the 1980s. The visas would be available to those living in Ireland
or illegal aliens living in the United States.
   ``Our offices in New York have been pretty well inundated over
the last couple of weeks from prospective applicants,'' Sean
Minihane, a lobbyist for the Irish Immigration Reform Movement,
said Monday. ``In Boston particularly there will be a collective
sigh of relief.''
   Irish illegal aliens are concentrated in the Boston and New York
metropolitan areas. New York City, northeastern New Jersey and
southwestern Connecticut account for roughly 70,000 illegal or
``undocumented'' Irish residents, according to Minihane. The Boston
area has an estimated 25,000. Other pockets of Irish residents
include Chicago, Hartford, Conn., Philadelphia and San Francisco.
   Existing immigration law has cut off the supply of visas granted
to Ireland at well below the actual demand. The current immigration
formulas favor visa applicants who have recent-immigrant relatives
already living in the United States - countries such as Cambodia,
Vietnam and Mexico.
   The new bill would substantially boost the number of immigrants
allowed into the United States each year, especially those with job
skills. President Bush has said he supports the legislation. White
House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the bill could be signed into law
as early as this week.
   The bill would boost the current limit of 490,000 immigrants a
year to 645,000 through the 1994 fiscal year. After that the limit
would be 675,000 per year.
   Irish advocates told of illegal aliens unable to travel to
Ireland to attend a family funeral for fear they would not be
allowed to return to the United States. They told of skilled
professionals and artisans forced to tend bar or mind children
because they could not enter the job market.
   ``You had young women forced to work as nannies or as waitresses
because they couldn't teach here, although they were teachers in
Ireland,'' said Frank Costello, who works on Irish and immigrant
issues for Boston Mayor Ray Flynn. ``That was a waste of a
tremendous amount of talent and education that could be put to our
use.''
   In Ireland, there remains the problem of a flourishing education
system turning out skilled graduates to an economy with 17 percent
unemployment.
   ``The Irish government is delighted with this legislation,''
said an official with the Irish embassy in Washington, who asked
not to be named. ``By most economic forecasts, we will be stuck
with the problem of emigration until the next decade. We are
providing new jobs but not at a fast enough rate.''
   Immigrants from Italy and Poland are among the other countries
expected to benefit from the legislation. But for the next three
years, Ireland would be the only country with a guaranteed number
of visas - 16,000 per year for a total of 48,000.
   After 1994, up to 7,700 Irish would receive visas annually under
a ``diversity'' provision of the bill designed to offset the
unfairness of past immigration formulas. In addition, Irish could
apply under the traditional categories of family ties and
employment. For the latter half of the decade, Ireland could reach
the maximum allowable total for any country in a year, 20,000.
   Those numbers compare to the roughly 3,000 to 5,000 Irish visas
issued per year in the early 1980s and about 7,500 in the latter
part of the decade.

   Hundreds of French citizens arrived in Paris late Monday after
leaving Baghdad on a flight to freedom following a three-month
ordeal in which they had been held hostage in Iraq and occupied
Kuwait on the orders of Saddam Hussein.
   President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III warned
the United States would be quick to attack Iraq if provoked.
Israeli Prime MInister Yitzhak Shamir said Iraq would pay a
``terrible price'' if it ``lay a finger on Israel.''
   There was no indication whether the unusually hawkish remarks,
in separate speeches Monday, were made in coordination or meant to
respond to any specific threat from Iraq.
   The U.N. Security Council voted to hold Iraq liable for damages
caused by its takeover of Kuwait. Later, officers from the five
permanent council members met to discuss the sanctions in one of
the highest-level military meetings at the United Nations but the
session ended without a statement.
   In Paris, throngs of family members and journalists cheered as
the chartered Iraqi Airways Boeing 747 carrying 263 French citizens
and 19 other Westerners touched down at Paris' Charles de
Gaulle-Roissy airport at midnight.
   Among the Frenchmen were the last seven diplomats who endured an
arduous siege of their embassy in Kuwait.
   The Iraqi jetliner picked up more than 50 French evacuees in
Kuwait City in the afternoon before flying to Baghdad, where
hundreds of hostages celebrated with beer and whiskey as the plane
landed.
   About 60 French citizens believed to have been in Iraq and
Kuwait did not leave. A French spokesman said some opted to stay
behind and others may have managed to leave on their own.
   Isabelle Renoir, the Foreign Ministry officer in charge of the
hostage case, said one French citizen of Italian origin was
prevented from leaving Iraq. She did not provide other details.
   ``I can say now that all French citizens who wanted to go home
have gone home,'' French charge d'affaires Andre Janier said.
   Hundreds of Westerners remain in Iraq and Kuwait, some detained
at strategic sites as part of Saddam's ``human shield'' against
attack by the U.S.-led multinational force. Some of the French
citizens freed Monday had been part of the shield.
   ``The Iraqis constantly move hostages from one site to
another,'' said freed hostage Patrick Moniodde, a director of the
French perfume company Caron.
   ``There was no hygiene,'' he said. ``Toilets were very dirty,
but we always got medical care. Sure, Iraqis do not want to lose
any hostages. We are free today, but it was terrible for others.''
   Baker also offered new insights on the treatment of Americans
being held in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``These Americans are forced to live on vermin-ridden concrete
floors. They are kept in the dark during the day and move only at
night. They have had their meals cut to two a day. ... Many are
becoming sick as they endure a terrible ordeal,'' Baker said.
   Baker is to travel to Saudi Arabia on Friday.
   Moniodde said he met at least a dozen American and British
hostages and noted they were ``very depressed.''
   The Foreign Ministry confirmed France will honor Iraq's demand
to fill the jetliner with medicine for the return flight. Medicine
is excluded from the U.N. embargo of Iraq and Kuwait.
   President Bush said the United States would ``have no hesitancy
at all'' to use military force if provoked by Iraq and indicated he
feels no obligation to get Congress' approval.
   But Bush said at a news conference in San Francisco he was ``not
preparing anybody for anything. I'm as determined as I've ever been
that this aggression will not stand.'' More than 200,000 U.S.
troops have been sent to the gulf.
   Baker, in a speech released in Washington, said Iraq would
suffer ``the most severe consequences'' if Saddam decides to use
chemical or biological weapons.
   ``Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a possible use of force
if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait,'' he said.
   The U.N. resolution, the 10th since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug.
2, was approved by 13 nations. Cuba and Yemen abstained.
   Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations,
said the resolution ``will make it possible for those who advocate
war, combat and aggression to explicitly say that they have
exhausted all attempts to achieve peace, and that they have failed,
and that the war option is the only option left.''
   In previous resolutions, the Security Council has isolated Iraq
with an economic embargo and permitted U.N. member countries to use
warships to enforce it. The council also has demanded Iraq withdraw
from Kuwait and release all hostages.
   The new resolution demands that Baghdad allow food, water and
other supplies to be sent to Western diplomatic missions in Kuwait.
   The United States and Britain are the only Western nations with
embassies still open in Kuwait. In August, Iraq cut off water and
electricity to all embassies that refused to close and relocate in
Baghdad.
   French President Francois Mitterrand welcomed the release of the
hostages, saying: ``I express the joy of all the French people to
those coming home. But we will rejoice fully only when the other
hostages can return to their own countries.''
   Mitterrand spoke at a news conference outside Paris with
visiting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev said Saddam should not expect to split the
international alliance opposed to his seizure of Kuwait.
   ``We must not permit the Iraqi regime to hope there will be a
division, a weakening of positions,'' Gorbachev said, calling
Iraq's use of hostages ``amoral.''
   He said Arab nations might now be able to resolve the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   ``It seems to me that the Iraqis could be ready for this,''
Gorbachev said. ``If we were to have an inter-Arab meeting, this
would be the quickest way to a settlement.''
   Gorbachev's Middle East troubleshooter, Yevgeny Primakov, met
with Saddam on Sunday, and there was confusion about the success of
his mission. Initial reports said Primakov made little progress,
but on Monday Gorbachev said there were indications the Iraqi
president was being more flexible.
   Later Monday, however, in a CNN interview, Saddam said that
while the meeting was ``useful,'' he repeated he had no intention
of ordering his forces to leave Kuwait.
   Saddam also said he hoped war would not break out but that Iran
and Iraq, which fought from 1980-88, were ``the only armies with
wide experience in fighting wars'' in the region.
   Crude oil rose $1.67 to $34.68 per barrel for December delivery
on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid concerns that Primakov's
mission had failed.
   Saddam also told the Cable News Network it would be wrong to say
nothing was accomplished by Primakov's visit. He said he told
Primakov ``how the solutions could be reached to many of the issues
in the region.''

<HEAD>Bulk of Philippines Aid Up To Bush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has left the future of aid to the
Philippines in the hands of the Bush administration, directing the
transfer to that country of only about one fourth of the $681
million that could go there.
   The foreign aid bill sent to President Bush during the weekend
gives him broad discretion in how to allocate billions of dollars
in military and economic assistance to several countries for the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The president is expected to sign the $15.5 billion bill within
the next few days and decide within a month how to dole out
portions which Congress has not set aside for specific countries.
   Congress required that certain amounts be given to some
countries, including Egypt and Israel, but allowed the president
more discretion than in the past for others.
   The final version restores $60 million of aid that had been cut
out of the bill for the U.S.-led Multilateral Assistance Initiative
for the Philippines. That brought the total for the program to $160
million, the same as last year. The initiative is aimed at
providing up to $10 billion in aid and loans to the Philippines
from several countries over five years.
   Bush also has the authority to allocate an additional $40
million for the program as well as all or part of the $456 million
he pledged in military and economic aid tied to the presence of
U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   Last year, the amount Bush pledged was cut by $96 million,
bringing complaints from President Corazon Aquino and clouding
current talks over the future of the bases.
   An additional $25 million each year is tied to the bases
agreement, but it is provided under separate legislation in the
form of housing investment guarantees.
   Altogether, Congress gave Bush authority to disperse more than
$2 billion in aid that it did not designate for specific countries.
But it cut about $700 million from his overall foreign aid request,
leaving it to the administration which programs to reduce.

<HEAD>Aid To Zaire Goes Only To Non-Government Groups</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has cut off all military aid to the
central African country of Zaire and required that any other
assistance go only to non-government groups because of alleged
corruption and human rights abuses.
   The restriction in the foreign aid bill that passed both houses
of Congress during the weekend includes a provision that will allow
aid to groups that work with the Zaire government on humanitarian
programs.
   The bill also allows funds for an ongoing child survival program
which the U.S. Agency for International Development is operating
with the Zaire government.
   U.S. aid to Zaire last fiscal year totalled close to $54
million, including $4 million in military help. The bulk went to
food and development programs.
   The bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 does not
designate specific amounts for programs in Zaire, but leaves it up
to the administration to decide how much to designate.
   President Bush is expected to sign the foreign aid bill within
the next few days.
   A congressional report accompanying the legislation cited
``numerous reports from reputable human rights organizations
detailing a continuous pattern of human rights abuses by Zairian
security forces.''
   Amnesty International accused Zaire in a report last month of
continued violations by government security forces, including
violent repression of government opponents.
   The report said that although abuses have diminished in recent
years, incidents of banishment, torture and detention without
charge or trial are being uncovered.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has ruled the country for 25
years, has promised political reforms. In April, he gave citizens
the power to form political parties and trade unions.
   But the report by the Senate Appropriations Committee said
optimism about reform in Zaire was fleeting and has been followed
by delays and brutal attacks by Mobutu's security forces against
pro-democracy youths.
   The Zaire government said that a May 11 incident involving
Lubumbashi University students left one dead and 13 injured, but
news reports in Europe said the death toll was between 50 and 150.
   ``The committee does not believe it is in the interest of the
United States to provide financial support to a corrupt government
that continues to flagrantly violate fundamental human rights,''
the congressional report said.
   ``While the committee recognizes the dire needs of the Zairian
people who are among the poorest in the world, it cannot support
aid that legitimizes or supports the Mobutu regime,'' it said.

<HEAD>Japan Rejects Mandela Request for Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela said he was disappointed at Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu's rejection Monday of a request for $25
million in aid to the African National Congress.
   Kaifu told the ANC deputy president that Japan cannot grant the
aid because it does not give assistance to political parties.
   Instead, he offered money to South African groups working to
improve living conditions in South Africa, news reports said. In
addition, blacks would be eligible to come to Japan for
occupational training under U.N. auspices.
   Mandela, who was freed in February after more than 27 years in
prison, is to make a rare speech by a non-head of state in
Parliament on Tuesday. He arrived Saturday for a six-day visit.
   In his 50-minute meeting with Kaifu, Mandela said the ANC wanted
the money to help 20,000 political prisoners due to be released
soon by the South African government, the news reports said.
   Mandela said other countries have pledged money to the ANC, and
he hoped Japan would make an exception in its funding rules, the
Kyodo News Service reported. The report quoted an unidentified
Foreign Ministry official.
   Kaifu told Mandela that Japan has given $1.4 million worth of
assistance this year to black South Africans, Kyodo reported.
   Mandela was asked in a television interview to comment on the
controversy over a slur against blacks last month by Japan's
justice minister, Seiroku Kajiyama.
   Mandela said ``this is a matter which I would like to leave in
the hands of the leaders of this country.''
   Kajiyama provoked protests in Japan and in the United States
when he compared prostitutes in Tokyo to blacks in America who
``ruin the atmosphere'' of neighborhoods they move into.
   He later apologized and was reprimanded by Kaifu but was allowed
to keep his job despite calls for his resignation.
   Japan has banned direct private investment in South Africa since
the 1960s and does not have an ambassador in Pretoria, although it
maintains diplomatic relations with South Africa.

<HEAD>Japan in Dialogue with U.S. Blacks, Jews, Ambassador Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's ambassador to Washington said Monday
he would welcome more teaching in Japanese schools about the
concerns of such U.S. minorities as blacks and Jews.
   ``I can say categorically that anti-Semitism has no roots in
Japan,'' Ambassador Ryohei Murata told a gathering of the American
Jewish committee in what was described as the first speech by a
Japanese envoy in Washington to a Jewish group.
   ``Many Japanese are really ashamed'' of the recent slur against
African-Americans by their country's justice minister, he added
later in answer to a question.
   Both Murata and his hosts agreed that all concerned have
recognized and are addressing the problem of a knowledge gap about
each other on the part of the Japanese and the Israelis, and the
Japanese and American Jews, African-Americans and other U.S.
minorities.
   Meanwhile, Japanese-Israeli relations are expanding, said
Murata.
   ``We know quite a lot about the holocaust,'' in which millions
of Jews were killed in World War II, ``but there is no systematic
teaching or education about it,'' the ambassador said. ``I would
welcome more efforts be made to enhance understanding and knowledge
about how the Jewish people suffered.''
   ``We have been discussing with African-Americans'' increasing
awareness of minority issues in the United States, he added.
   Murata said that as ambassador, ``I worked rather hard'' dealing
with the uproar in the United States stirred by Japanese Justice
Minister Seiroku Kajiyama's remark in September comparing American
blacks to prostitutes moving into and spoiling residential
neighborhoods.
   He said he had met with leaders of the Congressional Black
Caucus and the National Association for Advancement of Colored
People, who have threatened a consumer boycott of Japanese imports.
Kajiyama apologized for his words and was publicly reprimanded by
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   ``We should take steps so we can have more constructive
relations with minority people in the United States,'' said the
ambassador. One reason many of his countrymen are insensitive to
their concerns, he said, is because Japan itself is such a
homogenous society with only very small minority groups.
   As for anti-Semitism, he said, the problem was ``almost total
lack of knowledge'' in Japan about Jews, providing unwarranted
prominence three years ago for several books with ``inaccurate
portrayals of Jews and Judaism. Some of those books sold well at
one time but that phenomenon does not exist any longer.''

   For an alert eagle it was fast food,
Alaska-style.
   After a morning of unsuccessful hunting on the Mendenhall
wetlands near Juneau, Gary Gunstrom finally dropped his first duck
of the season Sunday.
   As his golden retrievers dashed after the bird, a mature eagle
swooped down and stole it.
   ``He just snatched that thing and didn't even pause,'' Gunstrom
said. ``The one dog couldn't believe it.''
   It was the only duck Gunstrom saw all day, but he doesn't
begrudge the eagle an easy meal.
   ``No, he can have it,'' said Gunstrom, a biologist with the
state Department of Fish and Game. ``It was worth the trip just
seeing that happen. The sort of thing that can only happen up
here.''

<TEXT>
   Eight theater companies will receive grants from
AT&amp;T to present three new works and three adaptations of classics
next year in regional theaters in the United States and one theater
in Europe.
   The grants were announced Monday by AT&amp;T.
   Among the artists involved in the three AT&amp;T OnStage Classics
presentations are actress Diana Rigg, who will appear in a London
revival of ``All for Love,'' a rarely produced Restoration tragedy
by John Dryden, and Robert Wilson, who will design and direct a
production of Henrik Ibsen's ``When We Dead Awaken'' in Cambridge,
Mass., and Houston.
   ``All for Love'' will be presented by the Almeida Theater in
London for a limited engagement beginning April 30, 1991. ``When We
Dead Awaken'' will be performed at the American Repertory Theater
in Cambridge, Mass., in February and the Alley Theater in Houston
in May.
   The third classic adaptation will be a modern-day version of
Shakespeare's ``The Winter's Tale,'' done by the Cornerstone
Theater Company. The ensemble troupe that will tour 12 states and
perform outdoors in such cities as New York, Washington, Boston and
Miami next summer and fall.
   The amount to be spent on the classics presentations was not
disclosed, but AT&amp;T will spend $180,000 on new play development,
the company said.
   Receiving grants under AT&amp;T's ``New Plays for the Nineties
Project'' were:
   - The Old Globe Theater in San Diego, $50,000, to present ``The
White Rose'' by Lillian Garrett. The play, which opens Jan. 17,
1991, concerns a group of anti-Nazi students in World War II
Germany.
   - The Denver Center Theater Company in Denver, $50,000, to
present ``Back to the Blanket'' by Gary Leon Hill. The play looks
at the 1890 Indian massacre at Wounded Knee. It opens May 17, 1991.
   - Center Stage in Baltimore and the La Jolla Playhouse in La
Jolla, Calif., $40,000 each, to co-present a play entitled ``The
Heliotrope Bouquet by Scott Joplin and Louis Chauvin.'' The play,
written by Eric Overmyer and called ``a lyric theater poem,'' opens
Feb. 20, 1991, in Baltimore. It will be performed in California
next August.

<TEXT>
   William French Smith, one of Ronald Reagan's
kitchen cabinet confidants who helped make the former president a
millionaire and served as his first attorney general, died Monday
of cancer. He was 73.
   Smith led the Reagan administration's conservative shift on a
number of issues affecting domestic policy, notably civil rights.
   Under his influence, the administration took a more
laissez-faire attitude toward antitrust law, even though it
presided over the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph
Co.
   A Navy officer during World War II, Smith later became Reagan's
personal attorney, helping guide the investments that made the
former actor a millionaire.
   Smith served as the informal chairman of the president's kitchen
cabinet, a group of California millionaires who saw Reagan socially
and helped pick his first Cabinet. Others in the group included
Justin Dart, Walter Annenberg, Verne Orr, William Clark, Alfred
Bloomingdale and Holmes Tuttle.
   Smith was surrounded by his family when he died at the
University of Southern California's Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer
Hospital, where he was admitted Oct. 2, said spokeswoman Betsy
Bates.
   Ms. Bates said that at the request of the family, the hospital
withheld details on Smith's cancer.
   ``William French Smith served his country with the greatest
dedication and distinction,'' Reagan said in a statement. ``As
attorney general, he brought talent, wisdom, and the highest
integrity to the Department of Justice.
   ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened today,'' he said. ``We have
lost a dear friend, who we will always remember with the greatest
respect and affection.''
   Norman Barker, managing partner of Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, the
prestigious Los Angeles law firm Smith joined after leaving the
Navy in 1946, said Smith's ``list of accomplishments go on and on
and on.'' Smith was the firm's specialist in corporate relations
with labor.
   A member of an old New England family, Smith was born Aug. 26,
1917, in Wilton, N.H., and raised in Boston. He graduated from the
University of California at Berkeley in 1939 and received his law
degree from Harvard in 1942.
   Smith was appointed the 74th attorney general of the United
States in 1981 and served until 1985. He was followed by Edwin
Meese III.
   At his confirmation hearings, the publicity-shy Smith responded
to virtually every question by saying he would have to study the
matter.
   Early in his tenure, a magazine story quoted an administration
official as calling him a ``somnambulist,'' or sleepwalker, a
description that rankled him.
   But if he started slower than his predecessors, Smith altered
more department policies more sharply than any attorney general in
a generation.
   Among the changes in which he played a key role were the
appointment of the first woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, to the Supreme
Court; legislation overturning a 100-year-old ban on military aid
to civilian law enforcement; relaxation of rules against corporate
mergers, which had not been changed in 15 years; and halting the
Justice Department's advocacy of mandatory busing to desegregate
schools and of hiring and promotion goals to remedy job
discrimination.
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, who served as a partner in
Smith's law firm and later as his chief of staff in the Justice
Department, called his former law partner and mentor ``an immensely
gifted lawyer with marvelous sound and wise judgement and
unfailingly kind and thoughtful.''
   ``It was one of the ironies of his tenure that it was a tenure
characterized by such far-reaching and profound change in the
direction of the federal legal system ... (that) it was done in a
quintessentially quiet, prudent and lawyer-like fashion,'' Starr
said.
   Terry H. Eastland, a former aide to Smith and later the Justice
Department's chief spokesman under Meese, said Smith was ``someone
who was concerned about getting the law right, about doing the
right thing in a particular instance.''
   Eastland, now a conservative commentator and legal affairs
writer, and Starr credited Smith with formulating the Reagan
administration's response to the growing drug problem. The regional
task forces for the Drug Enforcement Administration were set up
under Smith's leadership.
   ``He was one of the early proponents of the proposition that
drugs are causing crime,'' Starr said. ``He felt strongly about
that.''
   Former Appellate Judge Robert H. Bork, whose Supreme Court
nomination was defeated by the Senate in 1988, called Smith ``a
very thoughtful man'' who played a low-key but important role in
picking judges for the federal bench.
   ``Since he was the one who talked me into becoming a judge, I
happened to think he is a good judge of judges,'' said Bork, who
was appointed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia by Reagan.
   Smith was one of 60 patients being treated at the Kenneth Norris
Jr. hospital, which specializes in experimental treatment, Ms.
Bates said. She did not know if Smith was undergoing experimental
treatment.
   The hospital is associated with the University of Southern
California and is one of 24 comprehensive cancer centers in the
nation designated by the National Institutes of Health.

   State Attorney General Steve Clark
proposed marriage and got his engagement ring returned to him over
dinners paid for by the state, his former fiancee testified Monday.
   Carrie Christie, an Atlanta lawyer, testified about more than a
dozen meals and trips she took with Clark in 1986 and 1987.
   The trial of Clark, 43, on a charge of theft by deception,
entered its second week Monday. Three of his former girlfriends,
including a former fiance, testified about hotel bills and lavish
meals that Clark paid for using a state-issued credit card.
   The prosecution rested its case Monday.
   Defense attorney Bill Bristow said he would ask the judge to
dismiss the case Tuesday. Failing that, he planned to call Clark to
the stand, he said.
   Ms. Christie said she traveled to Washington, D.C., twice to
meet Clark while he prepared to argue on the state's behalf before
the U.S. Supreme Court. She said she also traveled to San Francisco
and New Orleans with Clark.
   She said he arranged dates with her in Atlanta while he was on a
stopover to catch another flight to attend to state business
elsewhere.
   Ms. Christie also told the jury that Clark routinely jotted
notes on the back of his Visa receipts after dinner. That testimony
could be key because Clark has claimed he made mistakes in his
record keeping while trying to update his expense claims 60 to 90
days after the fact.
   The prosecution says Clark used a state-issued Visa card to wine
and dine family, friends, girlfriends and political supporters. He
could be sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined $15,000 if
convicted.
   The defense argues that the seven elected officials whose titles
are in the state constitution, including Clark, are exempt from
state spending laws and regulations.
   A state auditor testified Monday that Clark received $14,000
over two years from lawyer Ed Miller to pay his rent and a utility
bill. Miller listed Clark as a guest at seven state-paid meals
worth $1,414.
   Prosecutors are attempting to show Clark used state money to woo
political and personal contributors.
   Cheryl Pruett of Germantown, Tenn., who works in a bank, said
she spent the night with Clark at a Memphis hotel, and the defense
said records show the state paid for the room and food service. Ms.
Pruett also said she was in Hawaii with Clark in December 1986 when
he used a state credit card to pay $571 for a lunch after a
wedding.
   Karen Aufdenberg of Little Rock, who recently left a job at the
Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, testified that Clark paid for at
least eight meals with her that he billed to the state.
   Among the state-paid meals Ms. Christie testified about was an
August 1986 dinner at an Atlanta restaurant. Clark wrote on his
expense forms that Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers attended
the meal to discuss medical fraud investigations.
   Ms. Christie said Bowers was not at the meal and state business
was not discussed. She said it was her first date with Clark.
   During a March 1987 weekend in Washington, where Clark and
several staff members went to prepare for the Supreme Court
appearance, Ms. Christie said he proposed to her over a state-paid
meal.
   In August 1987, Clark and Ms. Christie had dinner in Atlanta.
The meal was written off to the state, but Ms. Christie said the
main thing that was discussed was her decision to break off the
engagement.
   They dated occasionally after that, she said.
   Clark's attorney, Bill Bristow, got Ms. Christie to acknowledge
that state business or law was discussed at some of the meals. She
was a law student at the time. She said the main topic at any meal
with Clark was his ambition to be governor.
   Dozens of people Clark listed as guests at state-paid meals say
they didn't eat with him. Some say they picked up the tab. Clark
bought fancy food, expensive wine and courted women with the credit
card, according to some of the 126 witnesses who testified last
week.
   Bristow has said none of that is against the law for a man who
is on the job 24 hours a day.

<HEAD>Court Awards Benefits to Widow of Alcoholic Brewery Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of a brewery worker who became
an alcoholic taking advantage of free beer at work is entitled to
workers' compensation benefits, an appeals court said in a ruling
issued Monday.
   Ruling on the case of Casimer A. Gacioch, who worked at the
Stroh Brewery Co., the state Court of Appeals said alcoholism is
like any disease and workers are entitled to compensation if the
work environment aggravates their condition.
   While Gacioch was predisposed to alcoholism before the brewery
hired him, he was not an alcoholic when he got the job, the court
said.
   The circumstances of the job shaped the course of Gacioch's
disease, the court said, ``aggravating and accelerating the
underlying alcoholic predisposition to the point of uncontrolled
addiction, thus constituting a personal injury'' under worker
compensation laws.
   Gacioch drank only three or four beers on weekends when he began
working on the assembly line at Stroh's in 1947, said Norton Cohen,
an attorney for Gacioch's widow, Wanda.
   Stroh's policy, following a 300-year-old European tradition,
permitted workers to drink all the beer they wanted during breaks,
and that contributed to Gacioch's alcoholism, Cohen said.
   By the time he was fired in 1974, Gacioch was drinking 12
bottles of beer a day, Cohen said.
   Gacioch died in 1977 when his hospital bed caught fire while he
was smoking. At the time he was being treated for severe liver
problems caused by his drinking. His widow could receive $106 a
week in workers' compensation benefits.
   An attorney for the brewery failed to return a telephone call
seeking comment.

   The eighth game of the world championship chess
match was adjourned Monday, and observers said challenger Anatoly
Karpov had the edge on titleholder Garry Kasparov.
   Play was to resume Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. when Kasparov's 41st
move is unsealed and played.
   Kasparov had appeared to have an advantage throughout the game,
but Karpov was one pawn ahead when the game adjourned and leading
grandmasters said he had the better position on the board.
   Karpov had a similar advantage after Friday's Game 7, his only
victory so far. Then, too, observers felt Karpov was in a superior
position on the board when the game was adjourned because of his
extra pawn.
   Kasparov conceded the game Saturday, leaving the pair tied 3{-3{
in their $3 million showdown.
   A player gets one point for a victory, and each player gets a
half point for a tie. Each player has now won once, with the other
five games ending in draws.
   The first player to reach 12{ points wins the championship.
Kasparov, who dethroned Karpov in 1985, would retain his title if
the match ended in a 12-12 tie.
   The first 12 games are being played in New York and the
remainder will be played in Lyon, France.
   The winner will get $1.7 million and the loser will get $1.3
million.

   District Judge Mickey Pennington also ordered the Rev. James D.

   Ray Weimers, 44, testified that they restrained and beat him in
January as part of a religious rite. The beating left Weimers with
facial scratches and bruises and a separated right shoulder.
   Dr. Ricardo Castillo, who treated Weimers, said his patient was
depressed and had confided to Price about marital and financial

   The cost of America's failure to ensure that
pregnant women receive proper care can be calculated in the
millions of dollars. But it also can be measured in the tortured
body of an infant born too soon and too small, as Mitchell
Landsberg finds in the last of a three-part series, ``Surviving
Year One.''

   Eric could almost fit in his father's hand,
if his father were there to hold him. He is so small, so weak, so
sick - a little boy pushed into the world far before his time.
   He is kept alive by machines. Machines make Eric breathe, and
machines keep Eric warm. Machines feed him and machines record his
heartbeat, his pulse rate, his temperature.
   He lives in a sterile glass crib, surrounded by banks of
blinking lights, tangled in a webbing of tubes and splints and
bandages. His eyes and his mouth open and shut, and he writhes
gently. For all the machinery, it is human suffering that contorts
his face and a human will that keeps his tiny heart beating.
   It shouldn't have been this way. Eric was born six months into
his mother's pregnancy, without benefit of meaningful prenatal care
or decent nutrition, and most likely with the damaging effects of
drugs.
   Now Eric, like his sister before him, is in the neonatal
intensive care unit at the Children's Hospital of New Jersey. Here,
in the corroded core of one of America's poorest cities, doctors
and nurses struggle daily to save babies who enter life too soon,
too sick and too small.
   ``This is so typical,'' says social worker Debbie Beacher, who
has just finished listening to Eric's mother recite her story of
drug abuse and homelessness. ``An unwed mother, young, a drug
abuser, has a baby born prematurely that ends up in this unit.''
   It is like this around the nation, in cities big and small, in
places like the Hospital for Sick Children in Washington, D.C., and
Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno, Calif.
   ``We're seeing a growing need for our kind of hospital in just
the past few years,'' said Dr. Edna Leung, a pediatrician at the
Hospital for Sick Children. ``It's sad. We enjoy what we do ... but
we just wish we could make some of these problems go away.''
   The problems won't go away, and their legacy is children like
Eric. Society pays, and the costs are enormous.
   It costs about $600 to administer prenatal care to a woman
during the nine months of a normal pregnancy. Drug treatment for a
crack addict costs about $5,000.
   Without prenatal care, without drug treatment, the risks of a
woman delivering a premature, low birthweight child increase
dramatically. And so do the costs.
   It costs an average of about $25,000 to treat a low birthweight
infant - one under 5.5 pounds. For extremely low birthweight
babies, under 1.65 pounds, the average is more than $100,000.
That's an average. Some cost far more.
   Once, the point would have been moot - such tiny babies would
have died at birth. But medicine has made tremendous strides in
saving them.
   Between 1980 and 1987, the infant mortality rate in the United
States dropped by about 20 percent. During the same period, the
percentage of infants born to mothers who had no erly prenatal
care scarcely changed, and the percentage of low birthweight
infants actually increased.
   Since birthweight is the single most important indicator of
infant health, the meaning is clear: Children are being born sicker
than ever, and medicine is using superior technology to keep them
alive.
   In Fresno, Dr. Nadarasa Visveshwara has been treating a baby
that weighed exactly 1 pound at birth. The child's mother, who is
on Medicaid, had received very little prenatal care.
   The baby is now six months old. The medical bills have topped
$750,000 and probably will be around $1 million by the time the
child is released from the hospital.
   The prospects for the child ever enjoying a productive life,
Visveshwara said, ``are very poor.''
   Does he ever ask, is it wise to save such children?
   ``Almost all the time,'' he said, ``because we hesitate to
produce an infant who will be a burden to the parents and to
society, and who won't be able to lead a productive life. ... But
the baby always gets the benefit of the doubt.''
   Eric, whose real name is being kept confidential, weighed
slightly more than 2 pounds at birth. In 1960, his odds of
surviving infancy would have been about one in 10. Today, they are
better than 50-50.
   His medical bills are around $100,000 and climbing, and his
parents have no ability to pay. His birth was costly, but not in
financial terms alone. There is an incalculable cost in pain and
suffering, in emotional distress and social disruption.
   These are statistics for extremely low birthweight infants,
those somewhat smaller than Eric:
   - 90 percent will suffer respiratory problems.
   - 70 percent will have brain hemorrhages.
   - 80 percent will have heart problems.
   - 50 percent will have liver problems.
   - 5 percent to 10 percent will be blind.
   - 2 percent to 3 percent will die of Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome.
   Of those who survive, 40 percent will be mildly handicapped, 40
percent will be severely handicapped and 20 percent will be normal.
   There's more. Premature infants are much more likely than other
children to have cerebral palsy. They are much more likely to have
learning disabilities later in life. And children who spend their
infancy in a hospital will have difficulty bonding with their
families, a trait also widely attributed to children exposed to
drugs in the womb. The longterm emotional costs are yet unknown.
   ``There's just not that closeness, and these kids have more
difficulty when we get them home,'' said Dr. John H. Niles Jr.,
president of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia.
``They're just not the joy that a baby should be.''
   ``It's like a Vietnam kind of thing,'' Niles added. ``These kids
have been in a battle, and there are going to be some scars. And
society is going to pay for those scars.''
   The easiest way to avoid the scars, most people believe, is to
make prenatal care widely available and do whatever it takes to get
women to take advantage of it.
   The most commonly repeated statistic about prenatal care is that
every $1 spent on it will save $3.30 in future medical costs.
   Dr. Shyan Sun, director of neonatology at the Children's
Hospital of New Jersey, is a skeptic. He shuffles through a file
drawer to pull out a list of everything his patients have going
against them. They are poor, they are young, they are unmarried,
uneducated; they abuse drugs, they drink, they smoke.
   ``One cannot naively believe that prenatal care alone will solve
the problem,'' Sun insisted. ``I am not optimistic that we will
make a difference in the near future. We still have to take care of
all these social problems.''

   It is a daunting prospect, as Eric and his mother illustrate.
Eric's mother, who asked that she be called Jane, is 25 years old.
She was born prematurely herself, and says her mother, her brothers
and sisters all were born prematurely too. She is a small woman,
with sharp features and a dull stare. Eric is her fifth child - all
have been born prematurely and small.
   ``My 2-year-old, he came home on a heart monitor, so I dealt
with that,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``And my 6 year-old, when
he came home he was having seizures. ... My oldest one, he was the
biggest of everybody. He was 4 pounds, 13 ounces.''
   Jane was living in a homeless shelter during her pregnancy with
Eric. She says she tried to get prenatal care, but the doctor ``had
an attitude'' and lectured her about eating corn chips. She didn't

   She insists she stopped doing drugs before her pregnancy; her
social worker says that's a lie. Since Eric was born, the hospital
has had to ask the police to pick up Jane every time it needs her
consent to perform surgery.
   ``I hate to come here,'' Jane says. ``It gets depressing, seeing
all those babies like that. God forbid I get attached to him and he
dies, then I've got a real emotional problem there. I'm not saying
I don't love him, but I just don't like seeing him like that.''

   Joseph Kelly Crockett snuggled next to his
mother, too young to do much of anything except eat, sleep and cry.
Too young to know that he is starting life a step behind most other
babies.
   Despite city-wide efforts to improve health care services and
lower Indianapolis' sky-high infant mortality rate, Joseph's mother
struggled to get caseworkers at the Marion County Welfare
Department to extend Medicaid to her fourth child.
   ``They don't care, or they don't want to care,'' said Lisa
Carter, 24. ``It's too much of a headache for them. It's almost as
if you're asking them for $20 out of their pocket.''
   Joseph was born prematurely; he was delivered at 36 weeks by
emergency Caesarian, and weighed 5 pounds. And it took seven weeks
before Joseph was added to the welfare rolls, before he could
receive Medicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food
stamps.
   In the interim, the pediatrician and hospital didn't press for
payment, but Miss Carter had to pay for his food and transportation
to the doctor herself.
   Joseph's father tried to help, but judging from the support he
gave Lisa during her pregnancy, she knows she couldn't count on
him.
   Nor could she count on the welfare department. The conscientious
caseworker who handled her file for two years recently quit. With
her departure returned the threats that the family's Medicaid and
Aid to Families With Dependent Children would be cut off because of
improper paperwork.
   But then, Miss Carter says her Medicaid coverage has been taken
away twice - both times unjustly, she believes.
   Miss Carter was 5 when her mother was murdered, but she overcame
that to become an A student in school.
   At 16, her first child, Taron Smith, was born, but she overcame
that to graduate from high school.
   Two years later, she was working toward an associate's degree in
secretarial sciences when her grandmother became ill. She quit
school to care for her and never returned.
   At 19, her daughter Shenika was born, weighing just 4 pounds, 12
ounces. Miss Carter had become a single, teen-age mother with two
young children, and she couldn't find a way out.
   ``I'm not stupid, but I have had plenty of tragic situations in
my life,'' she said. ``But I can't use that as a crutch.''
   In Indiana, a family of four must be living below 32.7 percent
of the federal poverty level, bringing in less than $385 a month,
to be eligible for Medicaid and AFDC. Only Alabama, Arkansas,
Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas and West Virginia have
stricter standards.
   For pregnant women and children under 6 years old, the picture
is brighter because of federal mandates.
   In April, Congress required all states to provide Medicaid
coverage to pregnant women and young children with family incomes
below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, $1,972 per month
for a family of four.
   Miss Carter feeds, clothes and shelters her family on child
support she receives from the children's fathers and on her $405 in
monthly AFDC payments, the state's maximum payment for a family of
five. Thirty-six states have higher payments.
   Even a part-time job at minumum wage would boost her income
above the state's limits. She and her oldest child would be
ineligible for Medicaid and the whole family would lose its AFDC
and food stamps.
   Still, Miss Carter has goals. She's looking for a job that pays
enough to take care of her four children. She wants to return to
school.
   ``My situation is not something that's good for my baby or my
other three babies,'' she said. ``I want to help myself, but I need
support. And I don't have any.''

<HEAD>IMF, in Search of More Space, Building New Home for Neighboring
Church</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund, which pumps
billions of dollars into debt-plagued economies around the world,
is taking on a project closer to home - building a new church for a
small congregation that's been its neighbor since 1973.
   Some time in the next few weeks, the IMF expects to close a deal
to acquire the quarter-acre property of the Western Presbyterian
Church, bringing to a close negotiations that began in the 1960s.
   In return, the fund is buying a new site, a few blocks away,
where it will build Western Presbyterian a new, slightly larger
home with a kitchen for feeding the homeless.
   It will move the church's English Gothic sanctuary, fieldstone
by fieldstone and stained glass window by stained glass window, and
rebuild it as part of the new structure.
   Not only that, it will provide Western Presbyterian with an
endowment, reported to be $4 million, to do such things as
construct housing for the homeless and help two congregations in
Ghana build churches.
   All in all, counting acquisition costs and an $8.5 million
construction budget, the deal totals around $22.5 million.
   So how did a church with about 135 worshipers on a good Sunday
come into such a bonanza?
   One might say by being in the right place at the right tim.
   In the 1960s, the IMF, a specialized agency of the United
Nations with the mission of stabilizing currency exchange, found
itself short of space and in need of a new home.
   It found the location it wanted, three blocks from the White
House and next door to the World Bank.
   ``Since the block was residentially zoned at the time, the only
way the IMF could get the bulk and density it wanted for an office
building was to offer forth a plan that contemplated developing the
entire block,'' said James B. Kaiser, IMF projects manager.
   There was just one problem. The Western Presbyterian
congregation didn't want to move from the block.
   The church, started in 1855, was already in its third home. Its
first was a warehouse not far from the new site. After a few years
there, the congregation built a new church across the street from
its present structure. It moved to its current location in 1935.
   ``The sanctuary is gorgeous, and they didn't want to lose
that,'' said the Rev. John W. Wimberly Jr., pastor of Western
Presbyterian.
   Also, they might have had to move out into the suburbs, where
land prices are somewhat cheaper.
   ``There was considerable sentiment about the symbolic value of
having the building located here, in the middle of what people call
the Wall Street of the World,'' Wimberly said.
   So the IMF proceeded to develop the rest of the block, finishing
one phase in 1973 and the second 10 years later, with the church
nestled into a U-shaped green space.
   Meanwhile the fund's staff continued to grow. It now numbers
about 2,000 from 100 countries. Since only 1,700 could be squeezed
into the building, the agency paid an estimated $3 million a year
to lease office space for the other 300.
   ``It came to our attention a couple of years ago that there had
been some changes that would make it more favorable for us to
reopen negotiations,'' said Kaiser.
   The church was growing, too. When Wimberly became its pastor in
1983, he said, there had been about 90 people in the congregation
and most of them were over 65. Now about half of the 135 worshipers
are 45 or younger.
   Western Presbyterian began feeding the homeless, and now feeds
about 200, using a kitchen designed for potluck suppers. It threw
open its doors for noontime meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous and
groups grappling with drug problems.
   The church was still reluctant to move, and the IMF asked if
there were any conditions under which the congregation might
consider it.
   Western Presbyterian listed some:
   -They wouldn't leave the neighborhood.
   -IMF would have to rebuild the sanctuary as it was.
   -They would need a commercial kitchen to feed the homeless.
   -They wanted air conditioning and underground parking, neither
of which the present church has.
   -IMF would pay the lawyers and the architects.
   -The job would be done in phases, so the congregation would not
miss a day of worship or the homeless miss a meal.
   -IMF would create an endowment to enable the church to expand
its mission.
   ``We debated it at great length and finally took a vote and the
vote was 2-1 in favor of making the move,'' Wimberly said.
   The executive board of the IMF also approved.
   Architect David Cox said it is hoped that construction can start
in the spring and be completed in about two years. Kaiser said IMF
hopes to start work on its expansion at that time.
   ``The fact the IMF was willing to take the sanctuary with us, I
think, was at the crux of it,'' said Wimberly. ``We could say,
`When you go down there, you're not going to be worshiping in some
glass palace or something.' People become very, very involved with
the place where they worship. It is a beautiful sanctuary. There is
something very humble in its beauty that kind of matches a lot of
the people that worship here.''

<HEAD>Private Lawyers Work as Volunteer Prosecutors To Clear Drug Cases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King County Superior Court is no longer hooked on
drug cases, thanks partly to private lawyers who served as
prosecutors without cost to the taxpayers.
   About a dozen ex-prosecutors and 30 relatively new lawyers
helped clear a backlog of 512 felony cases, most involving
possession of illegal drugs or intent to sell, court officials
said.
   ``It was a signal success, no question about it,'' Prosecuting
Attorney Norm Maleng said. ``We're going to continue to have the
private bar involved on a pro bono basis.''
   Precise statistics have not been compiled, but Maleng said the
conviction rate appeared to be just slightly less than the 80
percent for cases handled by staff prosecutors.
   Pro bono work, in which private lawyers are paid by their firms
or simply agree to handle cases without a fee, has long been common
in criminal law.
   Only recently, however, has the practice emerged as a potential
panacea to the volume of drug cases that plague prosecutors
nationwide, said Richard L. Wintory, director of the National Drug
Prosecution Center for the National District Attorneys' Association
in Alexandria, Va.
   San Diego has a well-established pro bono prosecutor program,
and for nearly two years the Delaware state attorney general's
office has had a ``lend-a-prosecutor'' agreement with a New York
law firm. Across Washington state, a similar effort has been
mounted in Spokane. The Delaware program is being challenged in the
appeal of a drunken-driving conviction in Court of Common Pleas in
Wilmington.
   Wintory said publicity on Seattle's crash program this summer
drew so much interest that he has begun a survey of prosecutors in
115 jurisdictions nationwide to identify other helpful programs.
   Drug case filings have more than doubled in many of the nation's
4,000 prosecutors' offices, but ``we haven't had anywhere near this
increase in prosecutor resources,'' he said of Seattle's program.
   The attraction for most participants and their employers to the
volunteer prosecutor program is accelerated trial experience. In
addition, some former prosecutors who left for higher pay in the
private sector miss their old work.
   Jesse Franklin, two years into private practice after five years
in Maleng's office, returned part-time for his first experience in
directing other lawyers. He supervised about 10 cases.
   ``I love doing the supervising. I get a kick out of it, partly
because I enjoy being a prosecutor so much,'' he said. ``You kind
of relive some of your old war stories.''
   Reaction from defense lawyers has ranged from muted demurrals to
the legal challenge in Delaware.
   ``It's sort of a novelty to be doing it for the prosecution,''
said Bob Boruchowitz, director of the non-profit Seattle-King
County Defender Association.
   ``The defense side is much more in need of resources than the
prosecution,'' Boruchowitz said. ``The pressure it put on our
lawyers, the strain on our lawyers, was significant. Many of our
lawyers were on back-to-back trials.''
   Presiding Judge Charles V. Johnson said he was more concerned
about overloading the 15 regular judges during the program, which
ran from July 25 to Aug. 31.
   Part-time service on the bench was enlisted from 22 superior
court judges from other counties, three lawyers who served as pro
tem judges and 14 court commissioners, judges from appellate and
other courts and retired jurists.
   ``We effectively had 12 additional judges,'' Maleng said.
   ``From our standpoint the program was a success, an outstanding
success,'' Johnson said.
   Boruchowitz contended the Seattle program resulted in trials by
volunteer prosecutors hungry for litigation in cases that usually
would have been settled with plea bargains.
   Wintory, however, said temporary prosecutors could ease
pressures to allow guilty pleas on reduced charges as an
alternative to dismissal for lack of preparation or failure to meet
speedy trial requirements.
   Kathryn Mauk, hired fresh out of law school by a firm that
handles mostly insurance cases, said she changed her career focus
after spending about a quarter to a third of her time as a
temporary prosecutor this summer.
   She won a conviction in her first case, a five-day trial on a
charge of possession of drugs with intent to deliver. Charges were
dismissed in another case because of an improper arrest, and three
others ended in guilty pleas.
   ``It's exhilarating. It's challenging,'' she said. ``It moves
quickly. You have to think on your feet. You have to be `on.' It's
a different kind of high.''

<HEAD>Newsroom Employees Decide To Continue Daily News Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daily News reporters and photographers wavered,
but then decided Oct. 28 to remain on strike rather than take up an
offer to cross picket lines and reclaim their jobs.
   ``We're willing to give the strike more time,'' reporter Paul
LaRosa said. ``There's no point in going back now.''
   The News, hit by a walkout Oct. 25 by nine of its 10 unions, had
said striking workers were welcome to return to their old jobs at
any time as long as permanent replacements had not been hired.
   A group of about 40 reporters and photographers belonging to the
750-member Newspaper Guild sent a delegation to discuss the matter
with Guild President Barry Lipton.
   Some complained the Guild's strike was called on the basis of a
false report that replacements had already been hired to fill
reporting slots.
   ``There's a lot of anger at the Guild leadership,'' said
striking reporter JoAnne Wasserman.
   But after the meeting, the group decided to stay on strike.
   No new talks were scheduled. The News said it planned to replace
the strikers permanently.
   The Daily News, the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily,
has published a paper each day since the strike began but conceded
it is having trouble delivering the paper.
   Home delivery was spotty and many newsstands were not getting
the newspaper. ``We have not been hitting all distribution points
as of yet,'' John T. Sloan, the newspaper's chief spokesman, said
Oct. 28. ``We will soon.''
   He also accused strikers of intimidating dealers and removing
papers from newsstands.
   Strikers have burned several delivery trucks and vandalized
others. About 20 strikers have been arrested since the strike
began, most on disorderly conduct charges.
   Workers at the A &amp; S Stationery store in Brooklyn said
club-wielding men had seized all 300 copies of the Sunday edition
of the News and scattered them in the gutter. ``I can't take the
paper or they will kill me,'' said one of the store's owners, Ali
Najeli.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified management source as
saying many drivers had become lost.
   The News said in a statement that it published and distributed
more than 1.2 million Sunday papers in the city and surrounding
suburbs, exceeding the previous day's press run by 500,000. The
News normally prints 1.46 million Sunday papers.
   The 71-year-old daily has been in a financial tailspin for a
decade. The News has lost about $115 million and seen daily
circulation slip by about 700,000 since 1980. It recently lost its
standing as the nation's largest metropolitan daily to the Los
Angeles Times.
   The strike began when 60 drivers at the News were replaced in a
dispute over whether a driver would be allowed to monitor a
conveyor belt while sitting down. The other unions followed suit.
   The unions claimed management provoked the crisis, which
followed 10 months of often stormy talks on contracts to replace
those that expired in March.

<HEAD>Tribune Reports 39 Percent Earnings Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tribune Co. reported a 39 percent decline in
after-tax profit for the third quarter due to operating losses at
its Canadian paper mills and the New York Daily News.
   The company said Oct. 22 that net income fell to $38.2 million,
or 52 cents a share, from $62.7 million, or 81 cents a share,
during the same period last year. Revenue slipped 0.5 percent to
$588 million from $590.7 million.
   Newspaper operating profit fell 15 percent for the quarter to
$48.4 million from $56.7 million last year, due to losses at the
Daily News. The company attributed the losses at the Daily News to
weak economic conditions in the New York market and what it calls a
``burdensome cost structure,'' which was at the heart of long labor
negotiations that boiled over into the strike Oct. 25.
   Profits for the remainder of the newspaper group, which includes
the Chicago Tribune and The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel, were down
slightly, the company said.
   For the third quarter, the company's Quebec and Ontario Paper
Co. reported a loss of $8.3 million, compared to a profit of $15.2
million last year. Strikes by the Canadian Paperworkers Union shut
down the Quebec newsprint mill for 31 days and the Ontario mill for
47 days.
   For the first three quarters, net income was down 27 percent at
$127.9 million, or 1.73 a share, from $174.8 million, or $2.27 a
share, last year. Revenue rose 2 percent to $1.83 billion from
$1.79 billion.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter Earnings Down at Times Mirror, Knight-Ridder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Co. said Oct. 24 its third-quarter after-tax profit
dropped 40.2 percent from a year ago, while Knight-Ridder Inc.
reported its net earnings slipped 3.2 percent from 1989 results
that included a one-time gain.
   Times Mirror said falling classified and retail advertising in
the Los Angeles Times as well as at its newspapers in the
economically troubled Northeast contributed to the declie.
   Knight-Ridder said that its newspaper operations were softer
than expected and that the newspaper ad revenue environment has
worsened steadily. The company said its earnings from continuing
operations were up from last year, excluding one-time gains on
asset sales in 1989.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles-based Times Mirror earned $41.9 million, or 33 cents
a share, on revenue of $895 million for the three months ended
Sept. 30. That compared with $70.1 million, or 54 cents per share,
on revenue of $873.9 million a year earlier.
   During the first nine months, profit fell 40 percent to $134.8
million, or $1.05 per share, from $223.9 million, or $1.73 per
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.7 percent to $2.68 billion
from $2.58 billion.
   In addition to the ad decline at the Times and the continuing
softness of advertising at newspapers in the Northeast, the
newspaper publishing division suffered from higher newsprint costs,
Chief Executive Robert F. Erburu said.
   ``Our non-advertising dependent businesses, led by our
professional publishing operations, turned in solid third-quarter
performances and should achieve revenue and earnings growth through
the remainder of the year,'' Erburu said in a statement.

   Miami-based Knight-Ridder earned $36.6 million, or 73 cents a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $37.8
million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings per share
were up because there were fewer outstanding.
   Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $570.5 million from $541 million.
   The 1989 results included a $4.2 million gain from the sale of
television stations. Earnings from continuing operations this year
were up 7.7 percent if that gain was excluded from the comparison.
   Operating profit in the newspaper division was up 5 percent to
$82.4 million, while the business information services division had
an operating profit of $3.9 million compared with $2.5 million a
year earlier.
   Robert F. Singleton, chief financial officer, said the newspaper
division results were helped by inclusion of one more Sunday this
quarter than last year.
   For the first nine months, Knight-Ridder earned $107 million, or
$2.10 a share, down 42.2 percent from $185.2 million, or $3.53 a
share, a year ago. The 1989 results included a gain on the sale of
a newspaper.
   Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $1.72 billion from $1.66 billion.
   Profit from continuing operations was up 12.8 percent from a
year ago, the company said, if gains on the sale of the Pasadena
(Calif.) Star News and the TV operations in 1989 were excluded from
the comparison.

<HEAD>Earnings All Off at Capital Cities-ABC, Washington Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. said Oct. 23 its
third-quarter net profit dropped 11.3 percent from a year ago,
largely due to losses on coverage of major league baseball by its
80 percent-owned ESPN cable TV network.
   The Washington Post Co. reported a 16.2 percent decline in its
after-tax profit, citing weakness in its region's newspaper ad
market.
   New York-based Capital Cities-ABC said it earned $71.7 million,
or $4.16 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with
$80.8 million, or $4.56 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10
percent to $1.21 billion from $1.10 billion.
   Operating income fell 8 percent to $143.9 million, including a
15 percent decline in broadcasting and a 9 percent increase in
publishing.
   The company also warned that earnings for the fourth quarter
will be down from a year ago because of significantly weaker
advertising demand at its ABC Television Network and eight TV
stations.
   The ABC Television Network reported modest profit improvement
for the third quarter as its ratings improved and ad demand was up
in prime time. Earnings from television and radio operations also
rose moderately, the company said.
   But income from video operations fell sharply because of losses
at ESPN in its first year of baseball coverage. The company did not
specify the amount of the loss but executives said it was
comparable to the $20 million loss in the second quarter. ESPN won
the right to telecast abou 175 regular season baseball games this
year, and losses had been anticipated when audience ratings were
below expectations in a slow ad environment.
   For the first nine months, Capital Cities-ABC earned $320.3
million, or $18.45 a share, up 5 percent from $303.7 million, or
$16.97 a share, in 1989. Revenue rose 11 percent to $3.83 billion
from $3.45 billion.
   The company said ad demand at its ABC Television Network and its
TV stations had been ``significantly weaker in the fourth quarter
than for the first nine months of 1990.''
   As a result, it said it expected fourth-quarter earnings to
decline from the $10.33 a share reported for the last three months
of 1989.
   Geoffrey Johnson, a securities analyst for Argus Research, said
he had expected the company to earn $12.50 a share for the fourth
quarter.
   ``They are a well-run operation but sometimes there is nothing
you can do,'' he said.
   The Washington Post Co. said it earned $37.5 million, or $3.14 a
share, in the third quarter, compared with $44.8 million, or $3.50
a share, for the third quarter of 1989. Revenue edged up 1 percent
to $348.7 million from $346.3 million.
   Newspaper revenue fell 7.1 percent in the quarter as ad volume
fell 14.7 percent at The Washington Post. Revenue rose 7.4 percent
at Newsweek and 14.1 percent in cable operations, while
broadcasting revenue was flat.
   For the first nine months, the company earned $132.5 million, or
$10.90 per share, down 9.7 percent from $146.8 million, or $11.44
per share, last year. Revenue rose 1 percent to $1.07 billion from
$1.06 billion.

<HEAD>Murdoch Says News Corp. Earnings Will Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch told a shareholders
meeting Oct. 23 he expects News Corp. Ltd. to increase earnings
despite uncertainties in some of its major markets.
   He did not estimate earnings and would not comment on the
company's short-term debt problems, which have depressed News
Corp.'s stock price in recent weeks.
   Short-term debt soared last fiscal year to $2.30 billion from
$396 million. Total debt rose to $8.21 billion from $6.13 billion.
   In an interview the day before the shareholders meeting, Murdoch
said News Corp. would concentrate on film and electronic media,
rather than the newspapers and magazines he used to build the
company.
   Newspapers and magazines now account for about 70 percent of
News Corp. profits.
   In the fiscal year ended last June 30, News Corp. reported that
earnings dropped 75.5 percent to $267 million, largely because of
losses at Murdoch's Sky-TV satellite broadcasting business in
Britain and a pilot strike at the half-owned Ansett Australia
airline.
   Stockholders approved a resolution allowing directors to issue
limited-voting shares. Murdoch wants to be able to issue such
shares so the company can raise funds without diluting his 45
percent stake in the company.

<HEAD>Infotech May Sell Businesses; Confirms SEC Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A media concern with stakes in Financial News
Network and UPI announced a management shakeup Oct. 24 and
disclosed financial problems that could result in the sale of its
businesses.
   Infotechnology Inc. also confirmed it is under investigation by
the government but declined to say why.
   Infotechnology named Alan Hirschfield and Allan Tessler interim
co-chief executives. They will ``serve as a restructuring team to
address FNN's and Infotech's financial problems'' and explore
options that could include the sale of some or all company
businesses, Infotechnology said in a statement.
   It also said the cash flow of Infotechnology and FNN was
``insufficient to meet operating expenses'' or cover some debts.
   Infotechnology said it was renegotiating $20.7 million in loans
for itself as well as $49.5 million in loans to FNN. In addition,
both were trying to reschedule lease payments for $161 million
worth of equipment.
   Infotechnology owns 47 percent of FNN, which provides 24-hour
stock quotes, business news and sports information on 3,500 cable
television systems that reach more than 35 million homes.
Infotechnology also owns 97 percent of UPI.
   Hirschfield and Tessler have been involved in several business
restructurings, Infotechnology said. Hirschfield is a former chief
executive of 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures; Tessler is
chairman of International Financial Group Inc., Ameriscribe Inc.
and International Controls Corp.
   The two replace Earl Brian, who had been chief executive and
will continue as ``non-executive chairman'' of the FNN and
Infotechnology boards.
   On Oct. 22, Infotechnology disclosed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that the SEC had ``issued a
formal order of investigation with respect to the company'' under
federal securities laws.
   Infotechnology spokeswoman Amber Gordon declined to say why the
company was under investigation, but said it was cooperating. The
SEC, which polices the nation's securities markets, does not
comment on any investigations as a matter of policy.
   On Oct. 23, Infotechnology was sued by shareholders, who claimed
executives issued false and misleading information about the
companies' finances.
   The suit filed in Manhattan's federal court represents all
people and entities who bought the company's stock between Sept.
28, 1989, and this Oct. 1, when both FNN and Infotech announced
they were unable to meet a deadline for completing financial
statements for the fiscal year that ended June 30.
   The lawsuit said the stock's price fell to $3 a share on Oct. 1
from its previous close of $5.75.
   ``Had plaintiff and the members of the class known of the
materially adverse information not disclosed by defendants, they
would not have purchased Infotech common stock at the artificially
inflated prices that were paid,'' the lawsuit said.

<HEAD>Byline Strike Staged in Dayton, Ohio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union members at the Dayton Daily News, who
have been without a contract since January 1989, staged a one-week
byline strike to protest pay and other issues.
   A statement from the Dayton Newspaper Guild on Oct. 22 said its
members had ``waited patiently for more than two years without
receiving a contractual pay raise while Dayton Newspapers Inc.,
publisher of the newspaper, has repeatedly resorted to tactics
designed to undermine and destroy our union.''
   Publisher Brad Tillson said the company continued to bargain in
good faith for a contract.
   ``We respect the right of our editorial employees to withhold
their names from their work. But we feel that the issues will only
be resolved through efforts at the bargaining table and not through
job actions,'' he said.
   The byline strike ended Oct. 27. The guild represents about 180
reporters, editors, photographers and other workers.

<HEAD>Price Hikes Planned for Wall Street Journal, Barron's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Oct. 25 it will raise
the newsstand price of The Wall Street Journal to 75 cents a copy
from 50 cents on Dec. 3, giving it the highest cover price for a
leading national daily newspaper.
   The move comes at a time when newspaper company profits are
slumping, but opinions were mixed on whether the Journal's move
would prompt other papers to risk circulation losses by raising
prices.
   At USA Today, one of the Journal's chief competitors, Larry
Lindquist, senior vice president for circulation, said the paper
had no plans to increase its cover price of 50 cents in 1991.
   Dow Jones also is boosting the annual subscription price for the
Journal by 7.8 percent to $139 from $129, effective Jan. 2.
   It said the price increases reflect higher transportation and
other publishing costs and rising newsprint and postage rates.
   Earlier this month, the company announced a 17.5 percent drop in
its third-quarter earnings, due in part to a decline in ad revenue.
It later disclosed a cost-cutting plan that included a freeze on
capital spending and total salaries, postponement of a new
magazine, and a reduction in the number of special reports in the
Journal.
   While several special-interest daily newspapers sell for more
than 50 cents a copy, the American Newspaper Publishers Association
said the Journal would be the first general-interest daily paper
with a newsstand price of 75 cents.
   The newsstand price of the Journal has been 50 cents since April
1984, when it was raised from 40 cents a copy. Subscription rates
were last raised two years ago.
   The Journal has the largest daily circulation of any U.S.
newspaper, averaging nearly 1.86 million copies in the six months
ended Sept. 30.
   Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones, said newsstand purchases
account for less than 300,000 in sales or less than 20 percent of
the total.
   He said newsstand sales fell slightly after the 1984 price
increase but circulation eventually recovered all lost ground.
   ``We can't predict what the impact of this increase will be but
the outlook for the long term is that we will gain back whatever we
lose,'' he said.
   Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies at Columbia University, characterized the Journal as
a special case with a relatively affluent audience that could well
afford to pay the extra quarter for the daily paper.
   But others said that with a weak advertising market putting a
drag on newspaper revenues throughout the country, more increases
could be on the way.
   Joseph Lorfano of the American Newspaper Publishers Association
said the single-copy price of newspapers has been rising steadily,
reaching an average of 30 cents per copy last year, up from 25
cents in 1987.
   May said 64 newspapers including the Journal have cover prices
of 50 cents a copy, up from only four at that figure in 1985.
   Dow Jones also said it was raising the newsstand price of
Barron's National Business and Financial Weekly to $2.50 a copy
from $2 effective with the Dec. 3 issue. The annual subscription
price will rise to $109 from $99 effective with the Jan. 7 issue.
   Barron's last raised its newsstand price in January 1989 and its
yearly rate in January 1990.

<HEAD>Use of Sketch Brings Protests, Apology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper apologized to the Islamic community
after a front-page sketch described as depicting the prophet
Mohammed triggered dozens of angry phone calls and a protest
outside its offices.
   Protesters called the sketch sacrilegious because no authentic
portraits of the prophet exist.
   ``The Sentinel regrets running the picture. We meant no offense
to the Islamic community,'' Editor Robert H. Wills said in a
front-page story Oct. 23.
   The picture was used with a wire service report that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein supposedly claimed to have received a
message from the prophet in a dream.
   The newspaper said the picture was taken from a file incorrectly
labeled ``Mohammed.'' The Sentinel did not say who the sketch
actually depicted.
   M.A. Cheema, former president of the Islamic Center of Milwaukee
and a member of the Islamic Society of North America, said pictures
and statues of historic religious figures are prohibited in Islam.
   The newspaper reported receiving dozens of telephone calls and a
letter from the Islamic Society of Milwaukee.
   The letter, signed by society president Muhammad Y. Khan and
Bassam Sayad, chairman of community outreach, said the group was
outraged.
   ``The prophet was never portrayed during his lifetime, and
paintings created in future years falsely misrepresent him and are
extremely offensive to the vast majority of Muslims,'' the letter
said.
   About a dozen demonstrators carrying signs marched outside the
newspaper the night of Oct. 23 to protest the use of the sketch.

<HEAD>Fake Newspaper Headline Used in Political Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Guy Hunt is airing a television
commercial that features a fake newspaper headline mentioning
Democrat Paul Hubbert, but a Hunt aide said Oct. 24 the ad was not
meant to be deceptive.
   The commercial begins with a photograph of Hubbert, former head
of the Alabama Education Association. An announcer says: ``Governor
Guy Hunt's efforts to improve education have been opposed time and
again by this man - Paul Hubbert.''
   A newspaper story is then briefly superimposed over Hubbert's
face, with the headline ``Hubbert Kills Hunt's Education Reform
Package.''
   A freeze-frame look at the newspaper story shows it really is
about budget problems at the U.S. Postal Service. The bogus
headline was electronically pasted on top of the story.
   A Hunt spokesman, Terry Abbott, said the commercial is not meant
to deceive people into believing a newspaper actually printed the
headline shown on the TV screen. Abbott said the headline is only a
``dramatization'' of Hunt's claims about Hubbert.
   Karen Cartee, an advertising professor at the University of
Alabama, said the fake headline tactic could be a serious blunder,
given reporters' increased scrutiny of political ads.
   ``That's like handing the newspapers and Hubbert a loaded
cannon,'' Ms. Cartee said. ``I'm shocked because . . . it's very
rare for political ads to be (outright) deceptive. They just don't
do it because it's stupid politics.
   ``If you're called on it, and made to look like a liar, you're
going to lose,'' she said. ``Negative ads have to be truthful to
work.''

<HEAD>Gun Salute, Flag Raising Marks Hostage's Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LORAIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The birthplace of hostage Terry Anderson
marked the hostage's 43rd birthday Oct. 27 with a flag raising, a
gun salute and the singing of ``Happy Birthday.''
   About 40 people, including 12 of Anderson's cousins, turned out
at City Hall for the gun salute and flag ceremony, then walked to a
park to join 500 others.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted by Moslem extremists in Beirut on March 16,
1985. He is the longest-held of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Anderson was born in Lorain and grew up in Batavia, N.Y., where
supporters decided against cake and singing to mark his birthday
because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   ``This year because of the new crisis it just seemed
inappropriate,'' said Anne Zickl, an organizer of past celebrations
for Anderson in Batavia.
   In Lorain, Anderson's cousins placed a large yellow ribbon on
the City Hall flagpole. Then they walked to nearby Veterans
Memorial Park, joined 500 people gathered for the city's annual
Halloween parade and sang ``Happy Birthday.''
   A bust of Anderson sculpted by artist Louis Dlugosz was placed
Oct. 26 in Batavia's City Hall, alongside a scrapbook of local
events held in Anderson's honor over the past six years.
   Residents signed the scrapbook as they viewed the bust at City
Hall, where they picked up small yellow ribbons and bumper stickers
reading ``Bring our hostages home from Lebanon.''

<HEAD>Mayor Calls for Ad Boycott To Protest Stalled Union Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The City Council is weighing a plan to
withhold city advertising from The Burlington Free Press until the
paper's management renews talks with the union representing the
paper's workers.
   Publisher Donna Donovan said the proposed boycott would hurt
union members, who include advertising sales representatives.
   Mayor Peter Clavelle went before the council on Oct. 22 and said
that Gannett Co. Inc., which owns the newspaper, drains dollars
from the local community.
   He urged councilors to ``send a strong message'' to the
newspaper that ``we won't support you economically until you serve
this community better than you have been doing.''
   Councilor Gene Bergman offered the resolution and said he hoped
it would be discussed at the next meeting, scheduled for the night
of Oct. 29.
   Talks between the paper and workers represented by the Graphic
Communication International Union have been stalled since last Dec.
7, when they broke down after 14 negotiating sessions. Workers had
voted to unionize the previous April.
   The two sides differ on estimates of how much advertising the
city buys from the newspaper. Clavelle put the annual amount at
$67,000, while Donovan said it is closer to $30,000.

   Mary Junck, publisher and president, said circulation of the
evening paper had dropped to 29,000 from a high of 121,000 in 1972.
Morning circulation of the paper has soared, she said.
   ``Like newspaper readers in other parts of the country, most of
ours want their newspaper in the morning,'' Junck said Oct. 23.
   A poor economic outlook for 1991 also led to the decision.
   ``The conversion to AM enables the Pioneer Press to focus all
its resources on the morning and Sunday editions. We're positioned
very well to be even more competitive and increase our circulation

   The Twin Cities' other evening newspaper, the Minneapolis Star,

<HEAD>Boehm Says He Made a Mistake by Staking Out Newspaper Building</HEAD>

   State Tax Commissioner John Boehm said he
erred in staking out a newspaper building to see who among his
employees had gone there to complain that he was stifling their
free speech at work.
   ``In retrospect, I made a mistake,'' Boehm said Oct. 25. ``It
was an error in judgment.''
   Earlier this month, a dozen Department of Revenue employees went
to the Journal-Star Printing Co. building to talk to a reporter.
Boehm acknowledged that he and his deputy commissioner drove around
the building, which houses the Lincoln Journal, The Lincoln Star
and Lincoln office of The Associated Press.
   A day later, Boehm distributed a memo to department
administrators. It dealt with whether employees could be
disciplined for insubordinate remarks during staff meetings about
the governor, a department head or other supervisors.
   Three of the employees who went to the newspaper building said
Oct. 25 that they felt department employees put their careers in
jeopardy if they disagreed with Boehm or criticized the
administration of Gov. Kay Orr.
   They said Boehm's surveillance increased their worries.
   ``Their fears are unfounded,'' Boehm said. ``I went there
because I had been told that maybe 40 or 50 department people were
going to be there and I was curious. I wasn't taking names.''
   Boehm said none of the employees who talked to reporters would

<HEAD>Defense in Reporter-Slaying Trial Says Jury Pool Too White</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Joseph Lomax, who is charged
in the slaying of newspaper reporter Kara Laczynski three years
ago, urged a Superior Court judge to make sure blacks and
minorities are well represented on the jury in Lomax's third trial.
   Race has evolved into a central issue in the case. Lomax is
black and Laczynski was white.
   During Lomax's second trial, defense lawyer Joseph Moniz
compared the Laczynski slaying to the well-known Stuart case in
Boston, where police were criticized for seeking a black suspect in
the killing of a white woman. Numerous blacks were questioned in
that case and one black man became a suspect before the woman's
husband was implicated.
   Supporters of Lomax characterize him as a black victim of white
justice.
   In a motion filed in Hartford Superior Court on Oct. 22, Moniz
urged Judge Maxwell Heiman ``to take appropriate steps to assure a
sufficient number of blacks and minorities to reflect a fair
cross-section of the community.''
   The names of potential jurors are culled only from voter
registration lists and Motor Vehicles Department records, Moniz
wrote.
   The jury pool thus fails to include city residents who don't
need or can't afford a car and who have been ``alienated from
participation in the political process,'' Moniz said.

out-of-court settlement with the widow of a Chinese-American

the Foreign Ministry reported.
   Ministry spokesman Huang Hsin-pi said Oct. 26 that the

   Liu, 52, was shot to death in 1984 in the garage of his home

politically motivated, filed a $200 million suit against Taiwan
authorities in U.S. courts, claiming they were behind the killing.
   Last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal ruled that the
Taiwan government was legally responsible for the acts of former
military intelligence chief Vice Admiral Wong Hsi-ling, who was
sentenced to life imprisonment by a Taiwan military court in 1985
for ordering three gangsters to murder Liu.
   The Taiwan government appealed the verdict to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Officials said the appeal had been dropped because of the
out-of-court settlement.

   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas shot to death a
Peruvian television reporter in a northern Andean city, police
said.
   Police said three guerrillas wearing hoods shot and killed Pedro
Macedo Figueroa late in the evening of Oct. 22 in the doorway of
his home in Huaraz, a city 175 miles north of Lima.
   Macedo, 53, was a reporter for the Lima television station
America Television.
   He was well-known in the Huaraz region for waging a campaign
against the guerrilla movement in local newspapers and on radio, a
local journalist said.

   With voters angry and their party plummeting
in the polls, Republicans who face congressional elections a week
from now are running hard - away from their president.
   ``I don't like to go against what the president is saying,''
said Rep. Tom Tauke, a Republican who is running for the Senate in
Iowa. ``But my judgment is that, in this case, the president has a
different job than I have.''
   GOP candidates who share Tauke's task - getting elected - are
trying to put as much daylight as possible between themselves and
the Republican occupant of the White House.
   The focal point for conflict is the $496 billion budget package
Congress approved this weekend before adjourning to the campaign
trail. The five-year deficit reduction bill, which President Bush
has said he will sign, includes $137 billion in new taxes and the
rest in spending cuts and reduced interest payments on the debt.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Soviet media has shelved its previous
unswerving support for Cuba and is becoming downright irreverent in
discussing the island's policies, its Marxist system and even Fidel
Castro himself.
   Although relations remain cordial at the official level, newly
liberated Soviet reporters are feeling no compunction about saying
what they think.
   The latest and perhaps most notorious example touched on an area
that has been sacrosanct for 30 years - Castro's personal life.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, a new wave, glasnost-era daily, said
recently that Castro has 32 houses, a personal security contingent
of 9,700 and five children by his ``present wife.'' So far as the
Cuban public knows, there has been no change in Castro's marital
status since he was divorced 35 years ago. Such subjects are taboo
in Cuba, and during the heyday of Soviet-Cuban relations, the
Moscow press was respectful of Cuban sensitivities on the subject.
But no longer.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The administration is adopting a new tactic in
Afghanistan, reflecting a determination to end one of its last
proxy wars against the Soviet Union.
   Officials and experts say the United States has shifted support
away from the exiled Afghan political leadership in Pakistan to the
rebel commanders inside Afghanistan who are fighting the
Soviet-armed government.
   U.S. officials hope the rebel commanders can break the stalemate
in the fighting and clear the way to a peace agreement with Moscow
and its surrogate government in Kabul.
   The rebels, armed by the United States and Saudi Arabia, have
failed to fulfill predictions they would defeat the Kabul
government after it lost the support of the Soviet troops, who
invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and went home 20 months ago.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - The accidental shooting death of a young
stockbroker by an officer looking for a burglar is one more strike
against a police force already struggling with allegations of
brutality and racism.
   Terry D. Barnes, 24, was shot between the eyes in his apartment.
Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had
entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out
of bed to see what was wrong.
   It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police
officers this year. In the previous three years, five people were
shot and killed.
   The department has suffered a string of complaints about
excessive force and racism since the spring. Police Chief Steven
Bishop said before the latest slaying that the department's
standing has fallen in the community, and a ``behavior
modification'' program is being developed for offending officers.
   ``We're part of the problem out there on the street, and we've
got to get back to good, basic police work,'' Bishop said after
Barnes' death.

   AFTON, Minn. (AP) - Allegations that Jon Grunseth cheated on his
wives and swam nude with teen-age girls combined to drive him from
the governor's race and plunge the Republican Party into turmoil
nine days before the election.
   Citing ``enormous pressure'' on his family, the political
process and the state, the 44-year-old business executive called it
quits late Sunday and apologized to supporters and contributors.
   ``I always haven't been a perfect person. I think I'm a pretty
decent guy, but I've made some mistakes and I feel badly about
that, too,'' Grunseth said at his home about 20 miles east of
Minneapolis.
   Grunseth was accused of having an affair during both of his
marriages and of skinny dipping with teen-age girls in 1981. He
denied the nude-swimming allegations and said the affair ended
before his second marriage in 1984.

<HEAD>Capital of Cyprus Now World's Only Divided City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is the last divided city, now that
the Berlin Wall has fallen and the Lebanese are dismantling the
line between Beirut's Moslems and Christians.
   It's not an enviable status and there is no sign it will change
soon, despite renewed efforts by the United Nations to reconcile
ethnic Greeks and Turks.
   Changing world conditions have raised hopes among the majority
Greek Cypriots on this eastern Mediterranean island, who number
about 500,000, that Nicosia's ``Green Line'' will be demolished.
   ``The continuing enforced division of Nicosia is an anachronism
after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the new spirit of
cooperation prevailing in the world,'' President George Vassiliou,
the Greek Cypriot leader, said in a speech.
   Nicosia was divided in 1964 after hundreds of people were killed
in three months of fighting between the Moslem ethnic Turks and
Christian Greeks. The Green Line that snakes through the Old City
got its name because a U.N. officer drew it on a map with green
ink.
   What was to be a temporary cease-fire line has lasted 26 years.
The Green Line was lengthened into an unofficial border across the
island after a Greek-sponsored coup in July 1974 briefly ousted the
late President Makarios and Turkey invaded, occupying the northern
third of the island.
   About 120,000 Turkish Cypriots live in the occupied zone and
proclaimed the region an independent Turkish Cypriot republic in
1983. Only Turkey recognizes it.
   The Green Line is a maze of narrow alleyways and streets,
overgrown with weeds, running through what used to be Nicosia's
main shopping area.
   Blue-bereted troopers of the 2,100-man U.N. peacekeeping force
patrol the no man's land between decaying, bullet-pocked buildings.
Greek and Turkish Cypriot forces in sandbagged pillboxes are only a
few yards apart at some points.
   A dozen people have been killed along the Green Line since 1974,
but there have been no serious encounters.
   Greek Cypriots hope U.N. pressure on Iraq to withdraw from
conquered Kuwait will force Turkey eventually to implement Security
Council resolutions on Cyprus.
   These demand the withdrawal of the 35,000 Turkish soldiers and
50,000 settlers from the north and the return to the region of
200,000 Greek Cypriots who fled in 1974 or were evicted.
   Diplomatic sources say pressure on Turkey is unlikely now
because of its growing importance in the U.N. trade embargo against
Iraq.
   Leaders of the Greek Cypriots note that Turkey is getting aid
from Washington and the United Nations for its stand against Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, while refusing to implement Security Council
resolutions on Cyprus.
   ``Such contradictions cannot be maintained under the new spirit
of international unanimity,'' government spokesman Akis Fantis
said. ``That's why we're hopeful that Nicosia's Green Line will
soon be dismantled.''
   Fantis may be overly optimistic.
   U.N.-sponsored reunification talks between Vassiliou and Rauf
Denktash, president the Turkish Cypriots, have been deadlocked
since June 1989.
   The Turkish Cypriots and Turkey have shown no recent signs of
willingness to accept a two-zone federation proposed by the United
Nations. Their position hardened after the Greek Cypriots applied
for membership in the European Community a few months ago without
consulting the ethnic Turks.
   Glafcos Clerides, leader of the Democratic Rally, the main
right-wing group among Greek Cypriots, said: ``Separation on the
basis of different political beliefs or communal differences
belongs in the past. The new idea . . . is to do away with
artificial divisions, like the one splitting Nicosia.''
   The main obstacles to a settlement are the demand by Denktash
for recognition of self-determination for the Turkish Cypriots and
his refusal to implement U.N. resolutions.
   Vassiliou rejects self-determination as tantamount to
recognizing the separate republic.
   To bolster his demands, Denktash forbids movement by Cypriots
across the Green Line. A foreigner may cross only after signing a
form recognizing the Turkish Cypriot state.
   ``The right of self-determination is not something we're
requesting from the Greeks,'' Denktash said. ``This right has been
exercised. It exists and we won't argue about it.''
   He and other Turkish Cypriot leaders say Cyprus cannot be
compared to Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
   They say Turkey invaded to protect Turkish Cypriots and exercise
its rights as a guarantor of the constitution under treaties that
made Cyprus independent of Britain in 1960.

<HEAD>Luis Lima Wants Some Attention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARGARET HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenor Luis Lima wishes opera fans
paid as much attention to how he acts as how he sings.
   ``Most opera lovers come for the voices. I never accepted
that,'' said Lima, who has performed at the Metropolitan Opera in
New York and is booked at La Scala in Milan.
   ``I enjoy being able to meld my voice into the music. But most
of all, I like the theatrical performance - the roles, the way you
interact with your partners, the study of the psychological
situations of the characters.''
   Lima, 42, considers himself an actor who sings rather than the
other way around. He gets irritated when a love scene or fantasy
role is judged only by what comes out of his mouth.
   When a fan told him his execution was fuzzy after one
performance, Lima responded, ``Were you listening with your head
down?''
   ``He was, and so he couldn't see that I was turned away from the
audience, watching my lover leave,'' the tenor recalled.
   Early in his career, Lima's acting ability covered deficiencies
in his voice. ``I was a very slow pupil,'' he said in an interview.
``I couldn't really adapt my voice and my nerves onstage to the
technical control. . . . Now, I think I can control my voice.''
   For Lima, the role of Don Jose in ``Carmen'' is one of the best
in all opera partly because a relatively ordinary person is
transformed into a passionate assassin.
   ``In three hours you go through the whole spectrum of emotions.
You destroy what you love, which you let destroy yourself first,''
he said.
   Rodolfo of ``La Boheme'' also fascinates Lima because he is
desperately, hopelessly in love.
   ``Every day something like this happens in the world, and I
think that's something important for us to play and for people to
see because it's a normal human situation,'' he said.
   As Hoffman in ``The Tales of Hoffman,'' Lima both tells the
story and is part of it. ``This is like being a puppet and the man
pulling the strings at the same time. This I love.''
   Lima seriously decided to study opera after hearing Richard
Tucker at the Colon Opera House in Buenos Aires. He made his debut
in 1973 in Lisbon, Portugal, in ``Cavaliera Risticana.''
   He was raised in a small city in Argentina and lives part of the
year on a horse ranch in Cordoba.
   Offstage, the father of four and son of a military pilot doesn't
act the role of the typical opera star. He skips parties, avoids
the glitz and complains about the falseness of show business and
lifelessness of most opera movies.
   A few hours before curtain call, Lima is more likely to be
romping with his kids than fretting over the high notes.
   ``It's more important that I take care of my children than go to
the theater and sing perfectly,'' he said. ``And if by changing
diapers or talking to my children . . . I'm going to lose a little
bit of energy or quality in my voice, it doesn't really matter to
me.''
   Not that he isn't serious about singing.
   ``When I go to the theater, I try to sing as accurately as
possible,'' he said, even when he's required to do Alfredo in ``La
Traviata,'' a role he thinks is paced too fast.
   ``But before, I think my life belongs to the place I am in.
Otherwise, you contaminate with your profession every aspect of
your life.''
   Lima has about 40 roles in his repertoire. Later this year,
he'll appear in Vienna productions of ``Carmen'' and ``Don
Carlos.'' Next year or the year after, he's booked for ``Carmen''
and ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' in San Francisco.
   In 1993, he is scheduled to appear in ``Manon Lescaut'' at La
Scala.
   Recording projects include Verdi's ``Requiem'' with Seiji Ozawa,
and an album of arias recorded at the Colon, where he appeared last
month in ``Faust.''

   Maxi Priest recently was out shopping in London
and decided to buy some clothes. He found a nice store, selected a
pair of trousers and went into the dressing room.
   When he came out, a line had formed for autographs.
   ``Obviously, the attention is there a lot more than it was
before,'' said Priest, whose sunny smile and sunny No. 1 single,
``Close to You,'' have made him a man worth waiting for.
   ``When I go to a club I like to find my little corner and dance
and see what's going on, trying to enjoy myself the way I used to
enjoy myself.''
   He insists that success won't change him. And even if you've
heard that a million times before, this time it might be true;
Priest has always been the center of attention. Aunts and uncles
fussed over him. Girls followed him in high school. Party guests
gave him money.
   ``I was brought up in a family of nine kids and I was the second
youngest,'' said Priest, 27, who grew up in southeast London.
``When you grow up in a big family, there's so many personalities
that you learn to deal with all different kinds of people. That
also helped me develop my personality.''
   Priest, speaking at the Manhattan offices of Charisma Records,
considers himself an international artist and his songs have popped
up all over the world. His debut release, the 1984 single ``Hey
Little Girl,'' became the first British reggae song to top the
charts in Jamaica. In 1988, he had an unlikely hit with a cover of
Cat Stevens' ``Wild World,'' a No. 1 single for four weeks in
England.
   But ``Close to You,'' his breakthrough American single, was the
most satisfying achievement for Priest. He only recorded ``Wild
World'' at the request of the record company and criticized the
song even after it became successful. ``Close to You,'' with its
funky track and breezy hook, was his idea.
   ``I was on my way to my writing suite in England, and I was
singing the hook, `I just want to be close to you,' '' Priest
recalled. ``When I got to the studio, I started to sing and the
other writers kind of dropped everything else. It just fell into
place.''
   Priest co-wrote seven of the 12 songs on his new album,
``Bonafide,'' a mix of pop, reggae and gospel. Included are love
songs such as ``Just a Little Bit Longer'' and ``Temptress,'' and
the more message-oriented ``Prayer for the World'' and ``Peace
Throughout the World.''
   He wanted diversity, bringing in 15 other songwriters and using
four sets of producers, including Grammy Award-winners Jazzie B and
Nellee Hooper of Soul II Soul.
   ``The album is almost the closest I've been to the ultimate
album I want to make, with all different styles of music for all
different types of people,'' Priest said.
   ``There are party songs. There are message songs, love songs.
It's almost like a personal cassette - a compilation of songs, with
different tempos and different feelings.''
   Priest created his own studio at age 14 and soon joined Saxon
International as a deejay for ``Sound System.'' In 1985, he signed
with 10 Records in England and released his debut album, ``You're
Safe.''
   Influences include Dennis Brown, Bob Marley, Motown, the Beatles
and Louis Armstrong. He listened to them all as a kid, but not just
for entertainment. Priest was already checking them out, looking
for tips on phrasing and songwriting.
   He thinks he's close to becoming a major star. ``Just a Little
Bit Longer'' is the next single off ``Bonafide'' and Priest
predicts if that becomes a hit, ``All doors are open.''
   ``It's a reggae track,'' he explained, `` `Close to You' is more
pop; they're very different songs. If that makes it, there are a
lot of other songs that could make it.''
   His shopping days would then be over, but Priest accepts that as
destiny. ``I know I've been gifted by god,'' he said. ``I think
there's a light shining on me.''
   Even if he decides to stay on the ``normal side'' of life, his
prayers are for peace, love and more hit singles, a humble way of
slipping payola to the lord.

<HEAD>On the Campaign Trail With Dan Quayle</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cruising toward town on a highway cleared for his
motorcade, Vice President Dan Quayle broadcast a rush hour traffic
report: ``My lane's clear.'' It was, of course, but there are
potholes along his political route to rival the traffic jams that
piled up at all the turnpike entrances.
   Quayle is trying to steer around them as he campaigns for
Republicans in the off-year elections a week away. He did his
tongue-in-cheek traffic item on a radio call-in program, using his
limousine telephone to keep campaigning between stops.
   When he goes home to Indiana to vote - and to take in an
election-eve pro football game in Indianapolis - Quayle will have
covered at least 44 of the 50 states. He will have appeared at
about 120 fundraising affairs that drew more than $16 million
campaign dollars. He'll have an address book full of GOP contacts
and some political chits that prove important to him in 1992.
   And he'll still be laboring to dispel the negative image and
adverse poll ratings that have plagued him since President Bush put
him on the 1988 ticket and the national stage.
   ``The only thing I can tell you ... is that we're doing the
job,'' the vice president said when the image issue was raised.
``Been doing the job now for, well, 18, 19 months. I've been
campaigning now in this election cycle in 44 different states, and
I feel that I've been very well received, been very well treated.
   ``I love the job,'' Quayle said.
   Bush already has said that Quayle will be his running mate again
in 1992. But there will inevitably be pressure for a ticket change,
especially if Bush and his ticket look vulnerable heading into the
next presidential campaign.
   That's a Republican habit, in varied circumstances. There was
mid-administration pressure against Bush's own vice presidential
renomination, Spiro T. Agnew's in 1972, Richard M. Nixon's in 1956.
Gerald R. Ford switched running mates, from Nelson A. Rockefeller
to Sen. Robert Dole, in his losing 1976 bid to win the White House
he held by appointment.
   So when Quayle wheeled into a vegetable stand in Lexington,
Mass., last week to appear amid the pumpkins with the Republican
candidate for governor, he was asked whether he was campaigning to
hold his own place on the ticket, two years hence.
   ``I'm campaigning for Bill Weld,'' he retorted.
   Nevertheless, the long, intensive campaign he has waged fits the
personal political agenda too, cementing his party ties with
Republicans seeking everything from Senate seats to low-profile
state offices. It puts him on campaign display without the gaffes
that made him the butt of late-night television comedy. There have
been slips, but not many, and not major.
   His campaign delivery is smoother, more relaxed, than two years
ago. It is the predictable set speech of a vice president, hailing
the chief, denouncing the Democrats for tax increases even though
Bush endorsed them. The crowds react just as predictably,
applauding at appropriate points.
   But the volume goes up when Quayle tackles Congress.
   ``The House of Representatives has been controlled by the
Democrats since I was seven years old,'' says Quayle, 43. Pause for
effect. Murmurs, then laughter, rippled through the crowd at the
courthouse in suburban Philadelphia.
   ``I tell you, there's an idea that is sweeping this country ...
and that is the idea that it is time to limit the terms,'' he says,
voice rising over the cheers. It plays as well at every stop.
   And it certainly plays better than his repeated defense of White
House acquiescence to tax increases. Quayle is said to have urged
privately that budget negotiations be scrapped earlier this month
in favor of a head-on challenge to Congress. He won't discuss his
advice to Bush. He says the decision was a close call politically,
but without a budget deal there could have been chaos.
   Now he tells the campaign crowds that the Democrats are
responsible for tax increases, assures the voters that the rich
will foot most of the bill, insists that millionaires will be taxed
more efficiently and surely than would have been the case with a
simple surtax.
   ``We have seen people say that it's going to be disastrous for
the Republican Party, but I don't believe that,'' Quayle said on
the Boston radio talk show. He said the voters should take out
their frustration on incumbents, meaning Democrats, giving them
``the hook and the heave-ho from the Congress and elsewhere,'' he
said. ``It's time for a change, the American people want a
change.''
   But when Quayle made a final campaign swing to the Northeast,
the candidate competition to stay at his side was less than
intense. That led to a suggestion that appearing with him might not
be helpful just now, given a public perception that Republicans are
protecting the rich.
   ``If that's the perception, it's an erroneous perception,'' he
said.
   ``...I can do three things for candidates - raise money, raise
the profile of individuals, and I can energize the troops. But as
far as getting people to vote for or against candidates, they have
to present themselves to the voters.''
   Still, Quayle wasn't denying GOP pain over the budget battle.
   ``You know how this thing goes in cycles,'' he said, flying back
to Washington, ``up one week, down the next. We've had a couple
rough weeks...
   ``I think we'll start to turn it around.''

<NOTE>Eds: Note language 4th and 6th grafs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Bart Simpson is no longer just a pint-sized
cartoon character with yellow skin, spiked hair and a big attitude.
   Now, depending on the venue, he is black, Hispanic, Jewish,
homophobic, sexually deviant or an outspoken foe of California
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein.
   Bootleg T-shirts of television's animated bad boy have been
cropping up across the country for months. But illegal ``Simpsons''
euphoria now has seemingly gotten out of hand.
   At the University of Iowa, the right-wing Campus Review recently
published a drawing of Bart warning off homosexuals while holding a
loaded slingshot.
   A few weeks back, a Republican news release was issued in Bart's
name, berating Feinstein for using crib notes written on her hand
during a televised debate with U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the GOP
nominee for governor.
   Shirts depicting Bart in a sexual act with his infant sister are
among the obscene Simpsons items that are being sold.
   The ugly turn of such rip-offs distresses ``Simpsons'' creator
Matt Groening and parent Fox Broadcasting Co., home of prime-time's
biggest cartoon hit, ``The Simpsons.''
   But illegal reproductions of TV's most popular dysfunctional
family cover a confounding spectrum. Distasteful depictions occupy
the most extreme end. At the other are an amazing variety of
cultural reproductions.
   ``The Simpsons,'' in all their yellow, bug-eyed glory, have been
adopted and adapted by diverse minority groups with little in
common except their hunger for public heroes.
   From the black community comes ``Air Bart'' and ``Magic Bart,''
takeoffs on popular professional basketball players Michael ``Air''
Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles
Lakers.
   In Mexico's border town of Tijuana, you can buy ``Bart Sanchez''
T-shirts and Bart pinatas. In Israel, there are ``Simpsons''
yarmulkes.
   Recast ``Simpsons'' paraphernalia also has been sighted in
Nicaragua and the Cayman Islands.
   The whole thing leaves Groening ``baffled and amazed.''
   Some of it amuses him. Some of it is just plain annoying.
   Twentieth Century Fox owners of the Fox network and ``The
Simpsons'' copyright, ``is not amused by my amusement,'' Groening
said recently.
   ``They've done a whole bunch of raids and confiscated
T-shirts,'' Groening said. ``Fox takes this as seriously as Disney
does.''
   Maybe. The Walt Disney Co. wastes little time in protecting its
copyrighted characters. In 1989, it sued the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences the day after actor Rob Lowe and an
unauthorized Snow White sang and danced during the internationally
televised Oscar ceremonies.
   Fox is vague, however, about what action it has taken against
``Simpsons'' wanna-bes.
   ``We go after it through proper legal means, we don't go after
it in the press,'' said Fox spokesman Brad Turell. ``We're going
after it as aggressively as we can. We are definitely prosecuting
people, but we don't comment pending litigation.''
   As for Bart's illegal, political use by California Republicans,
Turell said ``The Simpsons'' creators ``were very upset and
considering their options.''
   As for the inflammatory term for gays used by the Iowa college
publication, Turell said ``it really hasn't come to our attention
legally.''
   The fledgling network is upset by any offensive use of its
characters, Turell said. ``It's really unfortunate that people who
have no rights to these characters defile them and do things that
are really unfair to them.''
   Not to mention the lost revenues from copyright infringement.
   But to Groening, that is not really the issue.
   ``Somebody's making a lot of money off this,'' he said. ``But
money has never been my first concern.''
   Why have his cartoon characters become such a model for minority
groups?
   ``Bart looks cool no matter what skin color,'' Groening said.
``He lends himself to any color treatment.''
   Or as Mr. X puts it, ``Most people just got tired of seeing
white cartoons.''
   Mr. X, who says that is his real name, fashions a host of black
animated characters, ranging from ``The Jetsons'' to Bart Simpson,
onto embroidered shirts, hats and gloves.
   An artist and dancer, Mr. X says he creates the articles in his
Van Nuys office and gives them as gifts.
   ``Black people have nothing to look up to except Bill Cosby and
his kids.'' Mr. X said in a phone interview. ``Bart is down to
earth, he knows what's happening. He's got the language down. When
he says `Hey, dude, that's radical,' people listen.''
   Groening said the preponderance of uncopyrighted ``Simpsons''
gear also is caused by the seemingly simple outlines of the family
members' unmistakable profiles.
   ``The characters look like they're easy to draw, so it invites
doodlers everywhere to get into the act,'' Groening said.
   ``Just like the popularity of the TV show, there's this
explosion on the street. The ones I get mad at are the bigoted,
racist ones.''

Baby</HEAD>

   New mothers can't truly prepare for their first
day back to work. It's a journey made in trial and error, guilt,
anger and joy. Seven women - from a television reporter to an
inner-city nurse - share the highs and lows in diaries they agreed
to keep for The Associated Press.

   Martha Duffley leans over her son's crib, stretching the silent
moment.
   Too soon, it's the 6 a.m. feeding, the scrambling to get the
5-month-old dressed and packed for day care. In no time, it's the
first goodbye.
   ``No tears,'' the new mother promises herself, swinging her
compact car away from suburbia and into the commuter traffic
surging toward downtown Boston. ``No time for tears.''
   It's Martha's first day back.
   She is just one of about 1.9 million women who return to jobs
each year after having a child. Some mothers prefer to work; others
have no choice.
   Regardless of financial circumstances, fewer than 10 percent of
Americans live in what once was the traditional family headed by a
male breadwinner. Sixteen percent of women with infants worked in
the early 1960s, compared with more than 50 percent today.
   ``Women are still asking themselves: `Am I doing the right
thing?' '' said Barbara Reisman, executive director of the national
Child Care Action Campaign. ``Our mothers led a different life, and
theirs is the only model we have.''
   But that nuclear, 1950s model is, for many mothers, far out of
date. The rules have changed, the days grown longer and more
complicated.
   -Martha, a Boston postal supervisor, fears her son's caregiver
seems more a mother to him than she does.
   -Pam Salazar, a television reporter in Dayton, Ohio, wonders
whether continuing to breast-feed after returning to work seems
unprofessional.
   -Vicki Sugarman, who shares a job managing promotions for a
Stoughton, Mass.-based company, frets over finding convenient and
reputable day care.
   -Her partner, Janet Aikens, worries that their job-sharing
experiment at Reebok International Ltd. may be tokenism rather than
the start of a common option for working mothers.
   -Sheila Michelli, an Army captain in Fort Lee, Va., struggles to
negotiate shared parenting responsibilities with her
semi-workaholic husband.
   -Cynthia Sartin, a nurse in downtown New Orleans, feels guilt's
stab each time she tucks her sad-eyed baby girl into bed and slips
out the door.
   -Amanda Wallis, a San Francisco bank executive, realizes time
for herself has disappeared amid the crazy scramble that is modern
motherhood.
   These and millions of other moms are exhausted. Yet despite
their daily race, ``having it all'' still too often means living
with the uncomfortable sense that everything is only half-done.
   No simple ``how to'' manual exists to ease the dueling pressures
or explain away irrational guilt. Working parents still are
experimenting, making errors and veering off-track.
   ``If I were giving the nation a report card, I would have to
give us a `C,''' said Joseph Pleck, a family issues researcher at
Wheaton College in Norton, Mass. ``You can expect a little more
help from your husband, but don't expect much from your employer.''
   One in five men now pitch in at home and, Pleck said, their
increased participation in flexible hours, paternity leave and
other child care progams has helped debunk employers' perception
that these are special women's benefits.
   Still, less than half of working women receive paid maternity
leave, and only 11 percent of companies with more than 10 employees
offer on-site day care, subsidies, counseling or referrals,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
   The United States is the only industrialized nation besides
South Africa that has no family leave policy. The 1990 federal
budget of $7 billion for child care subsidies and tax credits
meanwhile lags far behind most other developed countries, according
to the Children's Defense Fund.
   ``Our expectations aren't realistic. Because the career system
hasn't been modified, women are always doing two things at once,''
said sociologist Arlie Hochschild, whose ``The Second Shift''
examines two-career families.
   ``That's not liberation,'' she said. ``That's just bad for our
kids.''

<HEAD>The Adjustments, Stresses and Joys of Being Back at Work</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-First Day Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

   Here seven new mothers share diaries detailing the adjustments,
stresses and joys they found in their first days back on the job:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>A MOTHER'S STOLEN MOMENTS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``I find myself holding onto him more as he drops off to sleep
and not wanting to put him down,'' Martha Duffley writes on her
first day back. ``There are fewer hours that I am with him and I
hoard them.''
   By 9 a.m. Martha's pals down at the post office are saying,
``Gee, it's great to see you back on the job.'' They ask after her
5-month-old son, chat about motherhood, coo at the new mother's
battery of baby photos.
   By 10 a.m. things have quieted down. People drift back to their
work and Martha, a Boston post office supervisor, tucks the
pictures away in her wallet. No point in displaying them on her
desk.
   They only remind her of Brian's sparkling eyes, and the way her
own eyes swell when she cries, like she did last night at the
thought of leaving her son in someone else's care.
   ``I feel guilty,'' Martha writes. ``He is still so young. I
don't know if he is cognizant of what my role is in his life. I
rush home ... to remind him who I am.''
   The guilt lingers. The morning goodbyes grow no easier.
   Martha, 33, doesn't choose to work. Between her husband's job as
caretaker at the cemetery in their hometown of Milton, Mass., and
her work at the post office, the couple make $42,000 a year.
   ``I always thought I would be able to emulate (my mother) when
and if I had children,'' Martha wrote after going back to work this
summer. ``She was at home for us when we were young.''
   But mortgage payments and upkeep on the Duffley's home run
$8,000 a year. Add car payments and utilities: $11,400. Food and
gas cost about $7,500. Day care is $9,300 a year. The budget is
tight.
   ``I'm frustrated because I always wanted to stay home with my
children and I always knew I wouldn't be able to,'' she says. ``I'm
supposed to be the main person in his life, the one he loves.''
   Instead Martha wonders whether her son knows that Mary, his day
care provider, is not his mother. She tries not to miss Brian too
much, at the same time secretly hoping he misses her just a little.
   ``Somewhere deep inside I keep wanting to hear he misses me, he
feels a void in his life, he is not chuckling all the time,''
Martha writes. ``Just so I know I mean something in his life.''

<HEAD>BETWEEN BANK AND BABY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``She's asleep when I leave - no regrets about leaving. Excited
... at the prospect of being back again,'' Amanda Wallis writes.
``A lot of my friends cried the first day they left their babies. I
feel badly that I didn't.''
   The new mother is glad to be behind a desk after 13 weeks away
from her job directing Bank of America's private banking office in
San Francisco.
   The routine helps. Amanda is up at 4:30 a.m. to feed and play
with Katie, who is fast asleep again by 5:45 a.m. ``This gives me
time to exercise, shower and dress and be out of the house by 7:00
a.m.,'' she writes.
   Amanda's parents and live-in nanny make the days ``a lot more
manageable'' while her husband ``is wonderful with Katie and ...
has made juggling motherhood and career possible.''
   But it's easy to drop a ball, lose the balance.
   ``Katie was up and playing when I left this morning, which made
it harder to leave!'' Amanda writes on Tuesday. By Friday, she
writes: ``As time progresses I miss Katie more ...''
   Amanda's eyes drift more and more frequently to the newly framed
photograph of Katie. She wonders whether to check on things at her
ranch-style home in suburban Burlingame, where her daughter might
be crying or sleeping or smiling. At 37, Amanda was ready for
motherhood. She and Richard Blue, her husband of nine years, had
discussed the decision. They'd pondered the inevitable, and
substantial, changes a baby would bring.
   It's the smaller daily changes that sneak up. Amanda's heated
rollers have been cold for months because coiling her blonde hair
into a bun saves at least 10 minutes in the morning. An evening out
with her husband is rare; evenings out with friends rarer still.
   ``What I realize has now disappeared from my life is any free
time for myself,'' writes Amanda, whose staff of 24 caters to bank
clients with account balances of more than $5 million.
   ``I go to work, come home, play with the baby, put her to bed,
put myself to bed, and then I wake up and do it all over again.''

<HEAD>AROUND-THE-CLOCK CARETAKER:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Arianna wakes up during the night - but that's OK. I can give
a few more hours of sleep,'' writes Cynthia Sartin, whose focus day
and night is on others.
   Time with her 3-month-old daughter, Arianna, is wedged between
erratic shifts at New Orleans' Charity Hospital, where Cynthia
nurses AIDS patients and other strangers.
   Her first day back on the job begins when the baby wakes at 3
a.m. on July 2, and ends around midnight: ``Tired. Scratchy throat.
Sleepy.''
   Chronicling her life in a child's miniature diary, Cynthia fills
the pages with sentence fragments and third-person observations:
   ``Arrives at work. Butterflies in stomach ... Calls home. Dad
reading newspaper to baby. Wishes to be home. Continually shows
pictures to friends. Arrives home. Kisses baby over and over
again.''
   Arianna is everything to Cynthia, a stern Cajun woman determined
to be the mother she wasn't able to be as an unwed 20-year-old.
When she gave birth to her now teen-age son, Cynthia's eight
siblings and parents had to help out while she finished up nursing
school.
   Today, she says, ``It's a whole different ballgame. It's
overwhelming ... but I'm more mature. I can perceive so much more
about what her needs are.''
   Though she'd like to take care of Arianna all on her own,
Cynthia still relies on her husband and 16-year-old son. The two
men, whom Cynthia refers to as her ``other babies,'' have overcome
their fear of crushing the tiny girl while cradling her to sleep.
   Cynthia feels fortunate. She knows many mothers don't have such
support. Still, she writes: ``My feelings are those of inadequacy.
My only hope is that things will get better with time and, maybe, I
will not miss Arianna so much.''

<HEAD>MOTHERHOOD AND MARCHING ORDERS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``I called Mom to ask how the kids are doing,'' Capt. Sheila
Michelli writes after rejoining her Army unit for military
exercises. ``It's a relief to know that they miss me less than I
miss them.''
   An Army logistics officer at Fort Lee, Va., Sheila is a woman
who knows how to take control and get things done. But saying
goodbye to 6-week-old Connor is a tough order. He is the Michelli's
second son - the last child the couple plan.
   ``The most wrenching part about returning to work is giving up
breast-feeding,'' she writes at 5:53 p.m., after dropping the kids
off with her parents and heading for nine days of crisis combat
preparedness training.
   ``Connor I'll see in 11 days, but I'm done breast-feeding for
good,'' she writes. ``It's so final.''
   Still, letting go of her newborn is easier the second time
around. Sheila, 27, has finally decided to commit to a career with
the Army, where she believes working mothers have it pretty good.
   She received 28 days' paid maternity leave with her first child
and 42 days with Connor. Less than half of U.S. working women have
access to such maternity benefits, according to the Census Bureau.
   Shortly after returning to work last spring, Sheila was placed
in command of a 300-member unit. The Persian Gulf crisis has since
put pressure on the entire military, though the Michellis have not
been directly affected.
   Sheila is proud of herself, but the work is demanding. And her
husband, Tom, is a semi-workaholic who works as a computer
programmer for Virginia's National Guard.
   Because both are so committed to their careers, tensions arise.
Sometimes the couple ends up locking horns. But Sheila knows she
can count on Tom to help warm a bottle, wash a load of diapers or
be there when it's time to drive the babysitter home.
   ``It takes a lot of coordination and teamwork,'' says Sheila.
``We argue ... but he supports me.''
   And that, all the mothers agreed, is key.

<HEAD>BROADCASTING AND BREAST-FEEDING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The first day back at work was nothing short of traumatic,''
Pam Salazar writes after going back to her job reporting for
television station WKEF in Dayton, Ohio. ``The thought of leaving
my baby brought me to tears.''
   Although willing to cut back on hours at the office and forgo
her morning anchor position, Pam wasn't prepared to quit
broadcasting altogether.
   ``I guess I thought somehow the situation would magically work
itself out,'' she writes, after finding out how it feels to be
caught between news deadlines and her 5-month-old daughter, Chase.
   There are no magic wands when it comes to racing the clock. Pam
may roar home to relieve the babysitter after a late-breaking news
story or reel into work after prolonged morning good-byes.
   But breast-feeding is another story. Mother Nature won't be
rushed.
   ``I was extremely nervous,'' Pam, 28, wrote after her first
disastrous attempt at expressing milk in an office bathroom.
``Would I be able to master the art ... would I manage to pump
enough (milk) to feed my baby?''
   It was only after several attempts and with a lot of coaching by
telephone from her husband, Kyle Hickok, that Pam was able to get
the gadget to draw milk. The new mother felt like she was hogging
the bathroom and, perhaps, embarrassing her colleagues and herself.
   ``But my co-workers are very supportive of my breast-feeding,''
she writes. ``The news director bends over backwards to accommodate
Mother Nature's schedule, allowing me to only go out on short
stories so that I don't miss a pumping session.''
   The majority of employers are not as supportive. Of 6 million
U.S. companies, only a slim minority offer subsidies, referrals or
on-site day care for working mothers.
   Some working mothers read a message in the writing on the wall:
They feel they are not valued members of the labor force. Down at
the TV station, Pam found the kind of support many women crave -
and still there were tensions.
   ``Nursing is something I felt very strongly about, but I had my
doubts about how professional it would be,'' she reflects. ``I'm
pulled both ways ... feeling guilty that I'm not doing either of
(my jobs) very well.''

<HEAD>SHARING THE LOAD:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``My name is Vicki Sugarman and my game is the `Mommy Track,' ''
the new mother writes.
   ``I would be very upset if we were just a token, '' writes Janet
Aikens, who with Vicki shares a job managing promotions at Reebok
International Ltd. in Stoughton, Mass.
   Vicki and Janet each work three days a week, overlapping on
Wednesdays. The co-workers hit on the increasingly popular
alternative to full-time work and motherhood after each became
pregnant around the same time last year.
   Job-sharing has required some adjustments to ensure both women
are working on projects suited to their skills. All concerned
eventually decided it would be easier for Janet and Vicki to split
their hours but work independently.
   ``I now have the best of both worlds!'' writes Vicki, 31. ``I
can maintain my professional status and still be with my daughter
four days a week.''
   But read between the lines. It wasn't quite that simple.
   The night before her first day back, Vicki lay in bed staring at
the clock and wondering how being both a mother and a manager would
work out.
   ``It is 3 a.m. in the morning and I am still wide awake just
wondering: Will the baby think that I have deserted her? Will the
nanny take good care of her? What will it be like to be back in the
office? Have I forgotten everything I've ever learned? When will I
ever fall asleep?''
   Janet, too, has known fitful nights.
   Before the birth of her son, she was working 10 hours a day and
traveling at least a week out of every month. Her husband, Andy,
was matching her hour-for-hour at his job as an engineer for
Raytheon Co.
   ``I was determined not to let my pregnancy change anything, so I
continued to work, work, work ...'' Janet, 30, wrote after her
first day back. ``I wanted to be promoted to associate brand
manager by year's end, as scheduled.''
   But things changed. Priorities shifted.
   ``The decision not to return to my career full time was a very
difficult one for me. I had worked hard and long to get where I was
... (but) there was Skyler,'' Janet writes.
   ``I can get my career back on track, but I can never recapture
Skyler's childhood.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - The kibitzers this night include a playwright
from Spain, a drug dealer, a Queens housewife, a master chess
player from Harlem, a biker and assorted yuppies. They are in a
hotel next door to the old theater where Garry Kasparov and Anatoly
Karpov sit hunched over their chessboard. They watch the action on
closed-circuit TV and debate the players' every move, their
politics, their diet, their very nose scratchings.

   Chess notes from a witness who doesn't know a
Nimzo-Indian opening from a hole in his sock:
   In world-title chess, the kibitzer, not a piece of carved wood,
is king.
   Garry Kasparov is defending his world title against Anatoly
Karpov in the absolute silence of the old Hudson Theater, lately
sunk from the grandeur of the opening of Eugene O'Neill's ``Strange
Interlude'' to Times Square porno flicks, but now resurrected for
King's Pawn openings.
   The only, infrequent, sound is ``sh-sh-sh-sh.'' An observer
corks off into snores. He is immediately poked awake from three
directions. An elderly spectator noisily un-brownbags a sandwich.
An usher ushers him out.
   But next door in the Hotel Macklowe, which owns the Hudson and
is chess headquarters, hundreds, thousands debate the players'
every move, their politics, their diet, their very nose
scratchings.
   The Macklowe is a tower of babble from the lowest patzer
(German: ``to make a mess of things'') to the highest grandmasters.
Many tongues. All at once.
   Some 150 chess fans are crowded in a windowless lecture room of
the Macklowe to hear Roman Dzindzichashvili (luckily, he answers to
either ``Roman'' or ``Dzindzi,'' pronounced Gingi) analyze the
contest from closed-circuit TV.
   ``Kasparov will never make that move, never,'' says Gingi,
wielding his pointer at the TV screen. ``He will never do it
without first visiting bar.''
   Gingi, a rumpled Russian emigre with the hairdo of an astrakhan
sheep, once No. 6 in the chess world and twice U.S. champion,
speaks English with no ``the's.''
   Kasparov, after deliberating longer than the average Ice Age,
makes ``that move.'' The kibitzers genially boo Gingi.
   ``I boo you back.''
   Gingi survives the storm, bets a lollipop on Karpov's next move
with Mark Rubinstein of Brooklyn. Gingi's gambit declined. Mark is
up beyond his bedtime. He is 11.
   ...Karpov, after another Ice Age, moves a bishop...
   Anybody can kibitz, which may be the allure of this sport, if it
is a sport. Walter Mittys can fantasize they aced Ivan Lendl at
Wimbledon. Or faked a free safety out of his jock to catch one from
Joe Montana in the end zone. But these are only the fields of
dreams.
   In Gingi's lecture room many fans ponder on their pocket
chessboards the same imponderable Kasparov-Karpov ponder. They are
in the game!
   Tonight's kibitzers (games start at 5:30 p.m. and run five
hours) in Gingi's room include a playwright from Spain; a drug
dealer who shall be nameless; a Queens housewife; a motorcycle type
in leather jacket with a pile of Bud cans growing at his feet;
Jerald Times, 27, a master from Harlem; assorted briefcased
yuppies; one other woman; Rafael Knopler, who told them back home
in Israel he had to go to New York on business; and Ben Heller,
also from Queens, torn between the game and the latest train he can
catch before Manhattan's streets turn mean. He keeps glancing
nervously at his watch.
   ``Do these guys ever cheat?'' asks the only other woman present.
   ``I'm hired by International Chess Federation, not National
Enquirer,'' Gingi answers.
   ....Kasparov's knight to square c4...
   Kasparov, in the finest tradition of chess, hates Karpov, thinks
he's ``evil, a creature of darkness.'' Karpov, 37, was a favorite
of the pre-Gorby Kremlin. Kasparov, 27, half Jewish and all
Armenian, was not. In fact, he's red hot for democracy. He pasted a
pre-Revolution Russian flag on his side of the table. Karpov
protested. Kasparov counterprotested Karpov's hammer and sickle
flag. Both flags went. A draw.
   The two have played 120 games before this 24-game world
championship. Garry has won 17, Anatoly 16, the other 87 were
draws. There is a partition under the table separating their feet.
Kicking is out?
   ...Karpov bishop to a6...
   Other than Bush-Gorbachev and perhaps some hostile Wall Street
takeovers, this match is the only summit encounter conducted in
business suits. This is misleading. Chess takes no prisoners.
   Ben Franklin said of chess etiquette: ``You should not sing nor
whistle nor look at your watch nor make a tapping with your feet.''
Wilhelm Steinitz, an Austrian world champ 1886-94, once spat at his
opponent.
   ``A perfect porcupine,'' said a contemporary of Steinitz, known
as a poor loser and worse winner. ``Wherever you touched him was a
sharp point.''
   Aran Nimzovich, deviser of the Nimzo-Indian, once swept the
pieces off the board, crying: ``Why must I lose to this idiot?!''
He also did knee bends and stood on his head while his rival was
trying to concentrate.
   Emanuel Lasker, German world champ 1894-1921, would exhale ``a
virtual gas attack'' of cigar smoke across the table. One
tournament organizer protested that Lasker smoked the finest
Havanas away from the chessboard but switched to stinking nickel
rockets in competition. The Russian world title holder Michael
Botvinnik, 1946-57, used to train by having a sparring partner blow
smoke in his face during practice.
   When Siegbert Tarrasch challenged Lasker in 1908, he began and
concluded his dialogue with the champion thusly: ``I have only
three words to say to you in this match: `Check and mate.'''
   In keeping with the lowest level of sportsmanship at the highest
level of chess, Tarrasch, as have many others, blamed his defeat on
poor health. The match, held in Dusseldorf, was too close to
debilitating sea air, he complained. Dusseldorf was, and presumably
still is, 170 miles from the nearest coast.
   ...Kasparov puts a rook in play...
   ``Are both sides still equal?'' a kibitzer asks Gingi.
   ``One side is equal. Other has advantage,'' the grandmaster
hedges without elaboration.

   One-upmanship is an essential part of the kibitzer's arsenal. A
heavy European accent delivering profundities that mean nothing
helps. If you say Kus-PAR-off (correct) and he says KAS-par-off,
he's obviously a patzer. He says AL-eck-ein (Alexander Alekhine was
a universally despised world champion, drunk, lecher and
anti-Semite between the world wars and an immortal who ``fidgeted
like a dog on an ant hill'') pronouncing it something like the name
of the Tigers' Hall of Fame right-fielder, Al Kaline. If you say it
right, Al-YEKCH-in, you are a grandmaster and he is a nikulturny.
   ...Kasparov makes a move to no discernible pattern...
   ``There may be something sneaky in Kasparov's mind,'' says the
lady from Queens.
   ``This absolutely sneakless move,'' says Gingi, sipping a soda.
   Kasparov is known for a relentless attacking style, Karpov for
defense in depth like the Russians defending Moscow from Napoleon.
One columnist has said Garry has been all but ``berserk'' in
earlier matches even though to the untrained eye he has been as
immobile as Rodin's ``Thinker,'' except for minor league twitchings
and ear pulls.
   ...Karpov's men are in a Gligoric Variation, Kasparov's with a
knight split wide...
   Kasparov, who has the highest number of rating points in the
history of chess, has the type of mind that could do a Sunday
crossword puzzle in his head.
   He holds that head in his hands, fingers splayed around his
ears. Hand then adjusts a sleeve of his black suit. Recrosses legs.
Pinches nose. Cups chin in hand. Makes bipod of forearms, resting
nose on clasped fingers. Glares down athis men only inches away
like drill inspector at Parris Island reviewing recruits. After 23
minutes...
   ...Kasparov knight to f4...
   Queens housewife: ``Why do they take so long?''
   Gingi: ``They don't want to play nearly best move. They want to
play best move. They take time because they have time.''
   In a 41-move game it would take 1,000 billion generations to
play every possible combination at a fraction of a second per move.
We're getting there.
   Chess is a game of memory, technique, imagination and intuition.
The top grandmasters know an infinitude of moves, from the Maroozy
Bind variation of the Sicilian Defense to Queen's Gambit Declined.
The French Poisoned Pawn. The Velimirovic Attack.
   They constantly study past games of their opponent and
masterpiece games of the ages: Anderssen's Immortal in London,
1851; the Pearl of Zandvoort, Max Euwe versus Alekhine in 1935;
Frank Marshall's 23rd move at Breslau in 1912.
   All the while, said Saviely Tartakower, an Austrian grandmaster
earlier in this century: ``The blunders are there, all waiting to
be made.''
   ...The queens of both Kasparov and Karpov are dead...
   ``Chess kept me out of trouble,'' says Jerald Times, the young
Harlem master. ``I was a good kid, but it gave me pride in
intellect. A ballerina has to stretch her body. Same thing in
chess. It stretches your mind.''
   Times has survived a broken ghetto home, got to college, now
teaches poetry to the homeless, dropouts, kids in the violent
classrooms of the city.
   Chess, he says, takes more exertion than full-court basketball.
In summers he plays chess in Harlem parks until early morning. His
rapid articulation pauses when he considers what other Harlem kids
have done in parks in New York.
   Chess.
   ...The freewheeling end game has begun...
   ``Why does Kasparov always use the King's Indian defense?'' asks
Ben Heller.
   ``Because he knows it. It works for him,'' says Gingi. ``You
have job. You go to it every day. Why don't you change?''
   Heller leaves for his train.
   Gingi says it looks like a draw. ``No draw,'' says the Queens
housewife. ``I want my $25 bucks worth.''
   In 1924, the Soviet Union's Third All-Union Congress decided
chess was ``a weapon in the struggle for a higher cultural level''
and made the game a vehicle to show the world the superiority of
communism. The Soviet Union has held the world title since 1946
with but one exception. That was the American Bobby Fischer who
brought rudeness, neurosis, brilliance and prize money to an
all-time high in winning the title from Boris Spassky in Iceland in
1972.
   Fischer thereupon turned his back on multimillion-dollar gates
to lead a demonic, reclusive life among the derelict hotels in the
Los Angeles area. Half Jewish, he has reportedly become an ardent
admirer of Adolf Hitler. But Kasparov-Karpov can thank Fischer's
histrionics for making the $3 million prize money for their match
possible.
   Eccentricity if not madness is a not uncommon end game for chess
players. Paul Morphy of New Orleans blazed briefly in the 1850s and
is considered one of the best ever. Later he took to wandering the
streets claiming his friends turned enemies and were trying to
steal his clothes. A Polish grandmaster named Frydman stripped
during a tournament and ran through the hotel crying ``Fire!''
Steinitz went mad.
   Perhaps the most ``normal'' of the very greatest was Jose Raul
Capablanca, a Cuban who played basketball while at Columbia College
and once was late for a match having just left the bed of the
mistress of a grand duke.
   Examples of mental turmoil coupled with the intricacies of the
game give a popular impression that chess is a game for weirdo
geniuses.
   But a team of Russian psychologists made a study and found no
relationship between chess and general intelligence. Capablanca,
who was put on the payroll of the Cuban foreign office and posted
as a goodwill ambassador to wherever he had a tournament, said of
the game which he found as effortless as his love life:
   ``To play chess requires no intelligence at all.''
   ...Gingi is right. Karpov offers a draw, leaving the match 3-2
for Kasparov with seven more games to go at the Hudson and 12 more
if needed in Lyons, France...
   Mark Rubinstein goes to the souvenir room to browse through
chess books and T-shirts. ``It was boring,'' he kibitzes.
   Could he take the champ?
   ``In three years,'' says Mark, an 11-year-old Monday quarterback
plotting moves on his board of dreams.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Three hundred years after it was founded as a
trading post by the British East India Company, Calcutta is a city
of appalling filth and poverty, 12 million people struggling just
to survive. Despite all, as one Indian journalist once wrote,
Calcuttans ``love their wretched city with the same passion as a
mother loves her sick child.''

<DATELINE>CALCUTTA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's already hot and steamy at 6 a.m. as
Calcutta goes through its morning rituals.
   Joggers trot past the marble Victoria Monument and the
members-only Mohammadan Sports Club. The trimmed grass of the
nearby Calcutta Race Course is wet from the overnight monsoon
rains.
   Sheltered under the Hooghly Bridge a mile away, women cook a
meager breakfast over a fire of dried cow dung for a gaggle of
children, some naked, some in rags.
   Hundreds of people bathe in the sluggish brown water of the
Hooghly River. Devout Hindus, blessed by a nearly naked priest,
stand waist-deep in the river dipping copper bowls of spices and
flower petals into the water. Later their women will return to the
river steps with the laundry to slap the clothes clean on the
stone.
   Fifty yards upriver, near the flower market where servants of
the rich buy garlands of fresh marigolds and hibiscus, street
dwellers defecate into the water. But the river is holy, an arm of
the Mother Ganges and, therefore, cannot be unclean.
   Across the river, in a sprawling conglomerate of slums called
Howrah City, children splash under the hand pumps which supply
water for drinking and washing. People politely avert their eyes
from others using the open sewage canals between the shacks.
   In an hour the roads will be choked with traffic, and the air
will begin to thicken with a blue haze of exhaust fumes.
   For a few Calcutta residents, today may be a relaxed day at the
club. For millions of others, the day will bring another test of
survival.
   Everyone in the city will go without city-supplied electricity
for at least two hours. The hit-and-miss telephones will create
hours of frustration. Roads, pitted and impassable after a heavy
monsoon, will trap tens of thousands of cars like flies in a spider
web.
   Calcutta is 300 years old this year. Job Charnock, an agent of
the East India Company, founded the trading post on the Hooghly on
Aug. 24, 1690, near the village of Kalikata, named for Kali, the
feared goddess of power and destruction.
   It was, until 1912, the capital of British India, the second
city of the British Empire after London, a city that pandered to
the pleasures of the great men of the Anglo-Saxon world.
   Today Calcutta is in decay. Its Gothic Victorian-age buildings
are crumbling and blackened with grime and mold. Shanties sprout
like weeds in the sidewalk cracks.
   Even Calcutta's stately clubs look shabby. Walls are peeling at
the Saturday Club, where wealthy Indians sip gin and tonic on the
veranda overlooking grass tennis courts. The once-white uniforms of
the bearers, as the waiters are called, are stained and gray with
age.
   Decades of migration from impoverished villages and from
neighboring Bangladesh have swollen Calcutta's population to 12
million.
   City services are collapsing, concedes Hassia Abdul Habib, the
speaker of the West Bengal state legislature.
   ``The roads are mind-boggling. Communications are horrible. You
can phone London directly, but you can't phone your next-door
neighbor,'' he says.
   Calcutta, he adds, ``is coming to a boiling point.''
   At the same time, Calcutta throbs with life. It is the home of a
vibrant Bengal culture, poetry and experimental theater.
   ``Bengalis are not business people,'' says Ajay Chatterjee of
the Calcutta Municipal Development Authority. ``They love
literature, songs, drama. They are not pragmatic or practical.''
   Calcutta fostered all three of India's Nobel Prize laureates:
poet Rabindranath Tagore in 1913, physics researcher Chandrasekhara
V. Raman in 1930, and Mother Teresa, a naturalized Indian citizen
who won the 1979 Peace Prize for her work with the destitute.
   Perhaps only Calcutta, with its appalling poverty and capacity
for survival, could have given rise to the phenomenon of Mother
Teresa.
   Forty years ago the Yugoslav-born Catholic nun began to scoop up
the dying homeless from the gutters and rescue them from an
anonymous death. Her mission for the poor has spread to 92
countries.
   From the start, wealth and deprivation have coexisted in these
inhospitable surroundings.
   Built on mosquito-infested delta land 80 miles above the Bay of
Bengal, Calcutta suffers temperatures above 100 day after day in
summer. The drenching rains of the monsoon season, from July to
September, bring only humidity, not relief.

   British author Geoffrey Moorhouse called it an act of lunacy to
build a city here. ``Everything in Nature was against it.''
   Robert Clive, who turned the East India Company into an empire
for England in the 1750s, called Calcutta ``the most wicked place
in the Universe.''
   Mark Twain, who visited in 1896, said the weather was ``enough
to make a brass doorknob mushy.''
   Calcutta's reputation also is stained by corruption and unending
political intrigue. That, too, is nothing new.
   Lord Cornwallis, who was made governor of India after his
surrender at Yorktown in the American War of Independence, wrote
from his headquarters in Calcutta: ``Every native of India, I
verily believe, is corrupt.''
   With all its faults, most Calcuttans are intensely loyal.
   ``Bengalis love their wretched city with the same passion as a
mother loves her sick child,'' wrote Khushwant Singh, a leading
Indian author and journalist.
   ``We know all about our problems, but I love Calcutta,'' said
Yvonne de Silva, who runs a private bus service. ``It bugs me that
people come to Calcutta and take pictures of our garbage and our
streets. Why don't they take pictures of their own garbage?''
   Thousands of people live from the refuse which the city can't
collect fast enough. Some sift through it for peelings or chicken
skins for soup, competing with crows, cattle and pariah dogs.
Ragpickers search it for anything to sell.
   Women collect, dry and shape the droppings from the brahman
cattle, which roam freely. Others sweep up coal dust, wet it and
roll it into balls of black mud called gril that also can fuel a
cooking fire.
   Looking down from her second-story veranda, Sheila Lahiri
pointed to a shantytown that had sprung up opposite her apartment
on Ballygunge Road, a street of elegant residences.
   ``Could you believe this was possible 15 or even 10 years ago?''
said Mrs. Lahiri, whose father, Lord Sinha, was given a hereditary
seat in the British House of Lords.
   Authorities long ago gave up the idea of tearing down the slums
and focused instead on alleviating the misery.
   Calcutta used to have 1,000 deaths a year from cholera, but the
disease was brought under control by water filtering and installing
20,000 public hand pumps in the slums.
   Calcutta has always been the refuge for the poor and displaced
of eastern India. Waves of immigrants came with every ethnic
upheaval, famine or war.
   The population more than doubled from 4.4 million in 1950, to
9.2 million in 1975.
   While the city grew, its resources shrank. A silting of the
Hooghly virtually killed the port, which just 40 years ago received
nearly half of India's imports.
   Recession, labor strife and political terrorism in the 1960s
persuaded many businesses to leave. Fifty years after the
government shifted to New Delhi, the economic center of India has
gravitated to Bombay.
   The Communists, now 13 years in power, blame the policies of the
federal government in New Delhi for giving the state less than what
they say is its share of national funds.
   About 300,000 people have no home other than the pavement,
according to some estimates. Stretched out on dirty rags or on the
hard stone, they sleep undisturbed by the trucks and cars roaring
past.
   They have an average weekly income of less than $5.55, said a
study by the Institute of Local Government and Urban Studies.
   Thirteen percent of the street dwellers work as rickshaw
pullers, earning an average 66 cents a day. It's the last major
city on earth where men pull passenger carriages like human horses.
   The study estimated that 43 percent of the city's residents live
in huts in squatter settlements, refugee colonies or slum
neighborhoods, known here as a bustees.
   But an outsider walking through even the deepest slums of Howrah
senses no anger, nor danger.
   ``Life is hard here. These people have nothing to look forward
to,'' said Bettina Borgmann, a German doctor who volunteered to
spend her summer vacation in a slum clinic.
   ``But the people surprise me. Most seem quite happy. They are
content with what they have. Just look at the children playing
outside with whatever they can find. I have never felt
uncomfortable here.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Pop Musicians Play the British Crime Twins in Film</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   England makes its own contribution to the
gangster movie cycle with ``The Krays,'' about the twins who ruled
the London underworld during the 1960s.
   The stars are Gary and Martin Kemp, known to the music world as
leaders of the pop group Spandau Ballet. The Kemp brothers were
recently in Los Angeles to promote the movie. They are obviously
not criminal types. Nor are they twins, having been born two years
apart. Yet in ``The Krays,'' they provide a scary portrait of evil,
and they could easily pass for twins.
   Offscreen, you can tell the difference. Gary, 30, is the older
brother, the major force behind the Spandau Ballet, guitar player
and writer of the group's hit songs; he plays Ronald Kray, the
vicious twin. Martin, just turned 29, is the handsomer brother and
bass player; he's Reggie Kray.
   While the Kemps have shared the bandstand since the founding of
the Spandau Ballet, they haven't acted together since childhood.
   ``The first time we ever worked together was when I was 8 and
Gary was 10,'' said Martin. ``We played in a BBC television
production as brothers. From there we did a bit on television, not
always together. We were child actors for 10 years. Then we started
the Ballet.''
   ```The Krays' seemed like a wonderful opportunity to work
together again as actors,'' added Gary. ``It was something very
special to work on the idea of becoming twins. Even though we're
only two years about, we have our differences. I do think that
brothers don't have the same kind of telepathic connection with the
subconscious that twins have.
   ``It was a unique thing to work on, the same that an actor would
go through self-analysis to become a character. We had to analyze
our own relationship to become twins. It's very cheap
psychotherapy.''
   Ronnie and Reggie Kray began their professional careers as
boxers, drifted into the protection racket in the East End, then
moved into the club world. Like New York gangsters in the 1930s,
they operated a series of nightclubs and hobnobbed with such
luminaries as Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and Tony Bennett.
   The Kemps and their gang continued their grip on the London
underworld until both were convicted of murder in 1969. They are
serving 30-year prison terms.
   ``It was the closest England ever came to having organized
crime,'' said Martin. ``The Mafia never really infiltrated Britain.
Ronnie and Reggie actually controlled the biggest part of London
that has ever been controlled by individuals.
   ``The nicest thing about the movie is that we were asked to play
a lot more than just two-dimensional gangsters. We were asked to
actually get under their skins, to show those guys when they were
home relaxed and not just outdoors with their pals and putting on a
show as gangsters.''
   ``We certainly don't have the sibling rivalry that the Krays
had,'' remarked Gary. ``I'm always pleased to see Martin do well; I
don't feel any competition between us. And vice versa. We found
within the twin relationship - and I'm not condemning all twins -
there's always one who really could not exist without the other
partner.
   ``In the case of the Krays, it was Ronnie. Ronnie couldn't
handle any real relationship outside the one he had with his
brother. One of the worst things for Ronnie came when his brother
gets married and starts another relationship. His bitterness toward
that woman drove him more toward violence.''
   Gary and Martin Kemp have been performing most of their lives,
first as actors, then musicians. Gary appeared in the film ``Hide
and Seek'' and in BBC's ``Plaything.'' Martin played in series such
as ``Rumpole of the Bailey'' and ``Dixon of Dock Green.''
   The Kemps made their debut with the Spandau Ballet on Nov. 17,
1979, and a year later issued their first recording. For 10 years
their soft rock has been one of Britain's best-known exports. The
brothers often go their separate ways - Martin is on his way to a
movie in Australia, ``The Girl Who Came Late.'' But they always
return to their music.
   ``There are five people in the world who can make that
particular sound, which millions of people enjoy,'' commented Gary.
``So it should always be there to come back to.''

   Fiddler Mark O'Connor has played on
Grammy-winning albums and become one of the most sought-after
instrumentalists in the music business. But the master musician
doesn't think he's mastered anything.
   ``What I'm doing is the best I can at this time. The day when I
get something mastered would be the day I'd have to quit doing
it,'' he says.
   The 29-year-old O'Connor describes an intimate, almost poetic
relationship with his fiddle. It is a pairing that has made him
virtually peerless for his versatility.
   ``You establish this relationship as a duo. You work together
hand-in-hand and try to make it come alive,'' he says. ``If you
respect your instrument, it can give a lot back to you. Music is an
inner thing you try to achieve. The relationship becomes intense.''
   O'Connor can be heard playing as a sessions musician on
countless albums recorded in Nashville. He has released nine albums
of his own, first for Rounder Records and more recently for MCA
Records.
   The Country Music Foundation has just issued the LP ``Mark
O'Connor: The Championship Years.'' The cuts include his winning
performances between 1975 and 1984 at the National Old Time
Fiddler's Contest in Weiser, Idaho.
   He's even given a command performance of sorts. About 10 years
ago, he was a guest at former President Ronald Reagan's ranch in
California where he performed as one of the country's top young
musicians. He played ``Sweet Georgia Brown'' during an appearance
that became part of a special on public television.
   ``I was about as nervous as I've ever been,'' the soft-spoken
O'Connor recalled in an interview. ``I was almost white as a ghost.
But as an American musician, it was one of the most rewarding
things you could do.''
   O'Connor, a native of Seattle, taught himself to play fiddle at
age 11 by watching others. Naturally gifted, he was also proficient
on the guitar, banjo, mandolin and dobro. But the fiddle became his
instrument of choice.
   ``It seems like I'm a little bit more naturally expressive on
it,'' he said.
   He has made concert tours with the rock-fusion band Dixie Dregs
and with jazz master Stephane Grappelli. He played on Michael
Brecker's Grammy-winning jazz LP in 1989, ``Don't Try This at
Home,'' and collaborated with James Taylor on Taylor's album
``Never Die Young.'' He has won Frets Magazine's best
instrumentalist award six times.
   O'Connor has played on just about every style of record
possible.
   ``The variety of it is amazing,'' he said. ``The bulk of it is
country, and there's a lot of alternative things: jazz, folky, pop,
contemporary Christian.
   ``Music is so much a part of my being that I just walk around
with melodies in my head all day long.''
   O'Connor, who does not sing, says he loves all musical styles if
they are played well. ``I try to play these different styles and I
learn a lot from every style. It almost helps me play the opposing
style better. I don't get so wrapped up in the style or the idiom
that I reject others. I adapt.''
   Even though he plays almost every day, he said he's still
learning and searching for perfection.
   ``I feel like my mind is divided. One-half of it teaches the
other half. So one-half of it is constantly looking for new ideas
and new things to pick up. Then I train and teach myself those
things.
   ``The most rewarding part is improvisation, playing from the
inspiration of the moment and not knowing what you're going to do.
It's a little bit mysterious and magical. What it really is is
on-the-spot composition. You're letting it all out on the line.''
   O'Connor doesn't think he'll ever get tired of playing.
``Sometimes I do get tired of playing in the situations I'm playing
in. This happens more than tiring of the music itself. I don't want
to do one type of thing too many times. I'm always looking for the
ne approach.''

   John Oates of Hall and Oates and Bob Weir of the
Grateful Dead took a 200-mile trip in August, riding mountain
bicycles through national forests in Montana. Oates says it changed
his ideas about national forests.
   ``I thought you set up a camp and Smokey the Bear keeps you from
setting forest fires,'' he said. ``Through a friend in Montana I
heard about massive clear cutting going on in national forests.
   ``What we found was depressing and enlightening. A lot of forest
is being cut at a rate that cannot sustain continued growth. A lot
is exported to foreign countries. We went through a borderline
area, not devastated completely. It borders a wilderness area. The
delicate balance of the wildlife habitat is completely altered.''
   Oates said he planned to take his information to Washington and
seek a ``citizens' bill'' to protect national forests.
   Oates and Weir were accompanied on their bike trip by friends
and some members of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies who want to
designate part of the Rocky Mountain chain as a wilderness area.

   PARIS (AP) - A rare collection of historic china, including
pieces that once graced the tables of Marie Antoinette, goes to the
auction block next month at the Georges V Hotel.
   The pieces were gathered over three decades by Camille Le
Tallec, 85, one of France's most celebrated ceramists, who has
decorated dinnerware for European royalty and Tiffany eggs for
American connoisseurs.
   His collection - more than 1,000 pieces in every size and color
imaginable - tells the history of china craftsmanship over three
centuries and across Europe. He began collecting rare pieces to
learn the techniques used by the famous masters at Sevres and
Nevers, renowned for the purity of their form, color and design.
   One of the least expensive items for sale is a saucer that could
fetch $150, while a rare 16th-century china clock adorned with
flowers and human faces is estimated at $60,000.
   Among the most prized items are an 18th-century water jug made
for Madame Du Barry bearing her initials, a piece from Marie
Antoinette's dinner service that experts had thought to be lost and
a water pitcher and basin dating from the Revolution - one of the
few pieces ever done in its particular shade of lavender.
   The china will be sold Nov. 6-9, and can be previewed starting
Nov. 3.

   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) - Jas Obrecht, associate editor of Guitar
Player magazine, has completed his research on early blues music
for his book, ``Early Blues: The Music Before Robert Johnson.''
   The magazine editor has written about such blues superstars as
John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy and B.B. King and has just published a
book titled ``Blues Guitar: The Men Who Made the Music.''
   Obrecht said his current research focuses on the infant years of
blues music and on its more obscure originators. The new book will
contain a two-compact-disc set of blues songs in the back cover.
   ``It's an innovative marketing idea,'' Obrecht said. ``The CDs
will be done by Yazoo Records and I'll personally select the tracks
on the discs.''
   Obrecht said the book will be available around Christmas 1991.

<HEAD>Man Doesn't Regret Temporary Flirtation With `Fountain of Youth'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Robert Bensing doesn't feel cheated by his
brief flirtation with an age-reversing hormone that some fancy may
be the doorway to a futuristic Fountain of Youth.
   In fact, the 72-year-old retired chemist has found his joints no
longer ache constantly with arthritis and his skin is firmer,
giving him the appearance and vitality of a man much his junior.
   ``I feel a little more energetic,'' said Bensing, who relishes
being called ``son'' by a friend about his age and now can spend
more time gardening.
   He stopped taking the hormone more than 1{ years ago, and
doctors predicted the age-reversing symptoms of his therapy would
fade within a few months.
   ``Theoretically, I lost all that, but I don't feel that I did,''
Bensing said recently his rural Waukegan home. ``Since the benefits
didn't go away, I don't feel cheated. It was worth it. If it
contributes to the advancement of medical knowledge, we don't feel
cheated.''
   For a year, Bensing injected himself three times weekly with the
human growth hormone. Within six months of the first treatment, he
could unscrew bottle caps with ease, mow the law without tiring
easily and sit through lengthy car trips - all of which would have
been difficult months earlier.
   Tests revealed the hormone treatments helped shrink body fat,
restore lean body mass lost through aging and increase the
thickness of Bensing's skin.
   ``I noticed right off he was doing things much faster,'' said
Bensing's wife, Alice, 57. ``He was more willing to go places and
do things than before.''
   The growth hormone taken by Bensing and 19 other older male
volunteers is a synthetic version of one produced naturally in
humans. As one ages, the natural production of the hormone fades
and eventually stops, researchers have learned.
   Daniel Rudman, an endocrinologist at the Medical College of
Wisconsin in suburban Milwaukee and director of the experiment,
said researchers have determined the hormone injections reversed
aging in the body composition of elderly men by as much as 20
years.
   Rudman and his fellow researchers reported this summer in the
New England Journal of Medicine that the hormone increased lean
body mass in patients by 9 percent, decreased fat tissue by 14
percent and thickened skin by 7 percent.
   It does not, however, affect failing eyesight, hearing loss or
degeneration of brain cells. The improvements strictly involved the
patient's body mass.
   Rudman, 62, was among a group of physicians in the 1960s who
used human growth hormone to treat abnormally short children. He
decided to experiment with the hormone on the elderly after
watching his parents grow old and frail in a nursing home.
   The hormone, once only available by extraction from human
corpses, now is produced through genetic engineering. But regular
treatment costs $14,000 a year for adults.
   Experts warn it is too soon to determine the severity of
side-effects or whether the hormone could be produced cheaper and
more readily.
   Most of the men in the experiment have declined to talk publicly
since the study was published, some at the advice of the Medical
College of Wisconsin.
   Bensing, one of the first volunteers for the study, said the
hormone lessened the crippling effects of arthritis, prompted a
quicker recovery from a cataract operation and appeared to make a
crushed spinal disk a bit sturdier.
   ``There's a guy my age starting to call me `son,' '' Bensing
said. ``They said, `You look great.' ''
   When he began treatment, Bensing was told the possible side
effects included an increase in blood pressure or blood sugar. But
his only complaint was a numbness in his wrists, which he
attributed to pressure from skin and muscle growth. It stopped once
the therapy ceased, he said.
   But Bensing, who lost hearing in one ear while an Air Force
engineer in World War II, said he was disappointed the hormone
didn't help that.
   Mrs. Bensing, who was born with cerebral palsy, said she too
would like to one day receive the hormone.
   ``I've had limitations all my life,'' she said. ``I can see so
many benefits for women, osteoporosis and other problems in the
aging process.''
   Rudman, whose research was carried out at veterans' hospitals in
North Chicago and Milwaukee, said the hormone didn't appear to
significantly improve bone density, reverse brain cell loss, cure
failing vision or affect life span.
   Its value may lie in helping the chronically ill or older people
prepare for or recover from major medical operations or illnesses,
he said.
   Dr. Axel G. Feller, who helped in the experiments at the
Veterans Administration Medical Center in North Chicago, said
researchers are not prepared to recommend groth hormones for the
aged.
   ``We don't have the whole picture,'' Feller said.
   Results of the experiments on the elderly, which began in 1980
and are continuing, may make therapeutic applications of the
hormone available within five years, Rudman said.

   Age rarely stands in the way of success at
the ballot box in Michigan, despite Gov. James Blanchard's highly
publicized decision to dump his 78-year-old running mate.
   Statewide elected officials include not only Martha Griffiths,
who was 70 when she was elected to her first term as lieutenant
governor, but Democrats Secretary of State Richard Austin, 77, and
Attorney General Frank Kelley, 65. Both are running for new
four-year terms.
   ``No one has suggested to me that I should not run again, for
any reason,'' said Austin, seeking his sixth term. ``My personal
view is that voters generally do not regard my age in any way.
They're concerned about how well I perform in the office.''
   Austin's Republican opponent, state Rep. Judith Miller, 54, of
Birmingham, said she has no plans to question his fitness for
office at 77.
   ``From my perspective, whether you are young or old should not
be the determining factor in how you function. It's the kind of
thing I don't believe is a legitimate issue.''
   The fact that the issue of fitness was raised with Griffiths,
but not with Austin, irked her. The long-time champion of women's
rights complained the governor never would have booted her if she'd
been a 78-year-old man.
   Blanchard removed Griffiths from the Democratic ticket Aug. 24
after two terms, saying he no longer considers her ready to step in
and assume the governor's duties at a moment's notice.
   Age was not a factor, he said, but he declined to elaborate on
his reasons. Griffiths, who feuded publicly with Blanchard for
weeks about the breakup of their political partnership, said he
told her she could be on the ticket if she released her medical
records and tax returns. She refused, but told reporters her health
is good.
   Griffiths' only obvious problem is her hearing. At a news
conference responding to Blanchard's removal of her from the
ticket, she lost her hearing aid. She and her husband searched for
it on the floor behind the podium, retrieved it and put it back in
her ear, but she still had difficulty hearing questions.
   The former congresswoman keeps a busy schedule speaking to
women's groups and presiding over the Michigan Senate. But senators
complained she was cranky and lectured them like schoolchildren.
   Under Michigan's constitution, the lieutenant governor acts as
governor whenever the chief executive is out of state. That has
happened 18 days so far this year.
   The secretary of state is next in line. Austin was acting
governor for a week in 1988 when Blanchard and Griffiths were at
the Democratic National Convention.
   Austin oversees 185 offices around Michigan whose 2,000
employees issue driver's licenses, sell license plates and register
voters. His schedule runs 12 to 15 hours a day with no annual
vacations, said his scheduler, Ann Johnson.
   He looks lean and fit and credits that to habits developed as an
athlete, which included time as high school track team captain.
   ``Hurdles were my favorite event,'' he said. ``Somehow, I can
still visualize myself skimming over those hurdles. I wouldn't try
it today.''
   Austin walks six to eight miles every Sunday to keep his legs in
shape. ``That's half the battle,'' he said.
   Age is less of a hurdle for incumbents like Austin than
challengers, said David Rohde, professor of political science at
Michigan State University.
   ``It's much easier for the electorate to be convinced the person
is qualified to serve regardless of age if the person already is
serving,'' he said.
   But the fitness of an elderly person for office is an individual
matter, just as it is for younger candidates, he said. ``Partly it
depends on how visibly capable and vigorous the candidate is.''
   In Florida's Democratic primary for governor, Bill Nelson, 48,
tried to make age an issue, calling for a ``new generation of
leadership.'' His opponent, Lawton Chiles, 61, won the primary, and
age has not been an issue in the general election.
   Austin declined to comment on the Blanchard-Griffiths fuss,
which seems to have faded as a political issue as the governor
nears the end of his campaign for a third term.
   Blanchard, 48, replaced Griffiths with Olivia Maynard, 54,
director of the state Office of Services to the Aging.
   Republican challenger John Engler, 42, sought to capitalize on
the booting of Griffiths by adding gray hair to his ticket -
66-year-old Sen. Connie Binsfeld.

   At 73, Helen Menz thought she had scaled
her last mountain.
   After all, she'd climbed the 46 highest peaks of the
Adirondacks. She decided a climb up 4,159-foot Phelps Mountain last
summer would be her farewell to high-peaks hiking. Age had finally
caught up with her, she thought.
   Then a weekend hike on Wright Mountain proved her wrong. After
letting her son and grandchildren hike up the trail ahead of her,
she hit upon her own pace by walking then resting, walking and
resting.
   ``First thing I knew, I was on top,'' said Menz, who lives in
the Albany suburb of Loudonville. ``I finally owned up to the fact
that you have to go at your own pace.''
   Menz is not unique. Older climbers are common in the Adirondacks
all the way up to the high peaks. Dozens past their supposed prime
are proving that regularly scrambling up rocky crags and thwacking
through prickly brush is not exclusively for the young.
   ``You can do it until you're fairly old,'' Menz said. ``If you
sit down and say I'm finished, well then you are finished.''
   Menz said she likes to hike with all three generations of her
family at least twice a year. The only other nod to age is a
walking stick she carries to absorb some of the shock her knees no
longer can.
   ``Age is no limiting factor,'' said Ed Hixson, a surgeon from
Saranac Lake. ``It's an extremely good thing for older people.''
   Hixson, who has done a bit of climbing himself from the
Adirondacks to the peak of Mount Everest, said hiking is a healthy
alternative for people who can no longer handle jogging or team
sports.
   He warns though that prospective hikers should get a complete
check-up before putting the extra stress on the cardiovascular
system.
   Hixson, by the way, said most people ``would be amazed'' by the
number of older people climbing the Adirondacks.
   Older hikers run into the least trouble on the trails because
they generally bring a lifetime of experience with them. ``Most
older people who hike have hiked all their lives,'' he said.
   At 66, Chuck Bennett has been hiking in the mountains only six
years, but he has packed in a lifetime of climbing, making about
300 ascents.
   Bennett, a retired General Electric worker, figures he goes
high-peak hiking two or three times a week. Thursdays are given
over to the ``Crooked Caners,'' a loosely knit group of hikers who
regularly hit the trails of the Adirondacks and nearby areas. The
only membership rule is that there are no rules.
   Named after the crooked cane each member is presented with,
``Caners'' are mostly in their 60s. They've been hiking weekly the
past six years - rain or shine or even snow.
   ``No matter what the weather is, we go out,'' said Priscilla
Hayes, who at age 46 is the youngest of the group.
   A recent hike to the Hudson Gorge brought out 15 of the 50 or so
Caners. An off-and-on drizzle made the trail mucky and clouds of
flies clustered around the hikers heads. Hikers broke their brisk
pace only to spy a deer that crossed the path or check spores on
the back of fern fronds.
   ``It's nice to have a space where you can revive your spirit,''
said Pat Collier, 61, who has been climbing the range almost all
her life and seems to know the mountains personally.
   Six of her seven children have followed her footsteps -
literally - and made it to the top of each Adirondack peak.
   ``I never knew why I climbed. There's something alluring about
the peaks. There's something spiritual,'' said Grace Hudowalski,
who at 84 has stopped climbing but remains the Grand Old Lady of
Adirondack hikers and the first woman to scale all 46 of the
highest peaks.
   Hudowalski said she writes more than 500 letters a year
congratulating, and advising hikers and climbers of all ages.
   ``When you talk about mountains, you get very personal with
people,'' she said.

   Older people are being warned against
companies that offer worthless ``protection'' for their Social
Security benefits and promote other schemes that essentially
provide ``nothing for something.''
   A senior consumer alert issued by the American Association of
Retired Persons in cooperation with the National Association of
Attorneys General says the results promised in mailings that often
resemble government communications are anything but guaranteed.
   ``Instead, they are schemes that provide the consumer with
nothing for something,'' the consumer advisory said. It says the
misleading advertising in the mailings generally falls into one of
the following categories:
   - Misrepresenting the company as a U.S. government agency.
   - Charging for services the Social Security Administration
provides for free.
   - Selling so-called ``required'' items such as laminated Social
Security cards.
   - Using scare tactics to spur fund-raising efforts, suggesting,
for example, that failure to donate will prevent the group from
lobbying to ``save'' Social Security benefits.
   - Conducting ``highly suspicious'' sweepstakes contests to lure
older consumers into buying other services.
   The consumer alert noted that legislation under consideration in
Congress would permit postal authorities to declare unmailable
letters that could reasonably be seen as implying a government
connection which does not exist.
   This would supplement regulations issued by the Department of
Health and Human Services authorizing civil monetary penalties
against companies sending such mailings.
   The advisory also noted that there are companies operating
nationwide that offer ``protection'' for federal benefits.
   ``Without commenting further on the quality or honesty of their
services, it is important to note that none of these companies is
affiliated with a government agency, and that most are private,
profit-making companies,'' the alert said.
   The Social Security system provides free to anyone on request a
personalized statement of earnings and provides a method for
correcting errors.
   But the consumer advisory said companies use the form requesting
this service as a marketing tool and, for a fee, collect it from
older citizens and mail it to the Social Security Administration
for processing.
   ``Some of these companies even employ outrageous scare tactics
in soliciting business - such as warning that `an illegal alien may
be using your (Social Security) number to work illegally in this
country' or that `someone may be fraudulently collecting benefits
meant for you.'''
   Another approach offers to help a senior citizen apply for
Social Security benefits for an unnecessary $15 fee.
   Still another offers a gold-embossed, plastic-laminated
``lifetime'' Social Security card, claiming it can be used for
check cashing.
   The consumer advisory noted that the paper Social Security card
is good for a lifetime and can easily and cheaply be laminated.
   ``The substitute card provided by the `protection' service
cannot be used for any official purpose, such as check cashing,
thus making it an expensive and useless purchase,'' the advisory
said.

   From train-hopping hobo to television
celebrity, it's been a remarkable journey for Art Linkletter, who
says he never intended to get into show business in the first
place.
   ``I was studying to be an English professor,'' said Linkletter,
78. ``But as they say, life is what happens to you while you're
making other plans.''
   Adults remember Linkletter as the practical joker on NBC's
``People are Funny.''
   His ``House Party,'' also known as ``The Linkletter Show,'' ran
24 years on radio and TV, until 1969. Linkletter often made kids
the centerpiece of his routines, keeping a straight face while they
made embarrassing revelations about their parents.
   ``Family is the key. We had a traditional family,'' he said.
``My wife was a private person, taking care of the children, family
and house. I was the breadwinner. I had the fortress of my home, so
I could go out and battle the demons.''
   And who were these ``demons?'' Linkletter says everyone from
unscrupulous competitors to thieves, drug-pushers and other threats
to family health and happiness.
   Hoping to shield his loved ones, Linkletter said, he developed a
career that would enable his wife to stay at home. But he found
there are no guarantees in life.
   Linkletter's 20-year-old daughter, Diane, jumped to her death
from her sixth-floor Hollywood apartment in 1969 while under the
influence of LSD. Three months earlier, the husband of his oldest
daughter shot and killed himself. In 1980, his 35-year-old son,
Robert, was killed in a car accident.
   ``Life is not fair . . . not easy,'' he said. ``Outside, peer
pressure can wreak havoc with the nicest families. So that's the
part that's a gamble.
   ``But I'm an optimist. Even though I've had tragedies in my
life, and I've seen a lot of difficult things, I still am an
optimist.''
   Linkletter's own childhood had its share of struggles.
   Born Arthur Gordon Kelley, Linkletter's preacher-father
``drenched me in religion'' and forced him to take odd jobs during
the Depression, he said. So at 16, Linkletter left and became a
hobo, hopping trains across the West, working where he could.
   Several years later, Linkletter returned home and entered San
Diego State College, where he got his first taste of broadcasting.
He went on to national radio and finally television.
   Today he is recognized as the dapper silver-haired man who sells
therapeutic Contour Chairs, one of which he owns and occasionally
uses.
   ``The little kids don't know me generally,'' Linkletter said.
``Mothers come up to me in airports with children and say, `Jimmy,
this is Art Linkletter,' and the poor kid looks up and says, `Who's
he?'
   ``Of course, there was a time when every kid in America knew
me.''
   Linkletter doesn't seem to mind that his star has faded a bit.
   He owns a home in plush Bel-Air. The view from his Wilshire
district office takes in the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles.
He spoke with a visitor at a big desk topped with family photos and
a statue of an American bald eagle.
   He gives 75 to 80 lectures around the country each year. His
name appears on 23 books, including the best-sellers ``Kids Say the
Darndest Things'' and ``Old Age is Not for Sissies.'' His next book
is tentatively titled ``How to Make Your Child into a Human
Being.''
   Following his daughter's death, Linkletter began a nationwide
campaign against drug abuse. He continues to speak out against
drugs and said his faith in Christianity has grown.
   Lois, his wife of 54 years, continues to live the traditional
lifestyle, spending time with her children and grandchildren. She
said the key to their long marriage and prosperity was the absence
of competition.
   ``What he's good at, I'm not,'' she said, as she wallpapered her
home with her daughter Sharon. ``His rise to the top was gradual.
For us, it was a part of our lives.''
   Sharon, 44, said growing up as a Linkletter was at times
perplexing. She recalled feeling awkward at a public school because
she was a famous child. She later transferred to a private school.
   ``I think as an adult, unfortunately, a lot of the years growing
up were taken for granted,'' she said. ``It didn't seem odd to me
to be on TV Christmas shows. But as an adult, I saw what an
incredible life we had.''
   She now looks at her father as a man who ``made a whole rainbow
out of his life. He turned lemons into lemonade, and rain into
rainbows.''

<HEAD>At 73, China's Oldest Fashion Model in Prime of Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xu Xuejing looks much like other plump Chinese
grandmothers in gray cotton slacks and button-up sleeveless blouse,
her steel-gray hair pulled severely back in a knot at the nape of
her neck.
   And that's just the idea for China's oldest fashion model.
   Due to convention and lack of choice, older Chinese women tend
to favor almost identical outfits - white tunics or blouses, black
or gray baggy pants, earrings and severe haircuts or buns.
   They are often elegant in their simplicity but rarely
fashionable.
   Beijing's debut into world fashion as a major textile exporter,
however, has brought with it a growing sense of style for Chinese
women.
   Designer Lu Shiying established the Beijing Fashion Model Team
for Middle-aged and Elderly People in 1987 after noticing during a
visit to Japan that older Japanese women continued to care about
fashion long past 40.
   ``Older people here tend to wear black, white, gray and blue. We
look like old feudal grandmothers,'' said Mrs. Xu, 73. ``It's not
that we don't love beauty, but we just don't dare to make ourselves
beautiful.''
   Mrs. Xu, the daughter of a wealthy Shanghai industrialist, has
survived world war, civil war and revolution. During the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, she and her husband, who comes from a similar
family background, were branded enemies of society.
   Through it all, she retained the refinement of her upbringing -
an asset that helped make her a fashion model at 70, which she
decided to try after a daughter saw an ad in a newspaper, she said.
   After she retired from teaching music at 55, Mrs. Xu said, ``I
would just lay on the bed day after day. And I suffered so many
illnesses that my husband prepared my grave and was just waiting
for me to die.''
   Getting out and making new friends has given her a new lease on
life, she said.
   ``These experiences have given me an emotional backbone,'' Mrs.
Xu said. ``I haven't been really sick for three years.''
   A pioneer for her age group, Mrs. Xu said her modeling skills
are self-taught. ``I can't move like a young person, so I had to
figure out for myself how to walk to suit my image and
appearance.''
   And her husband, for the first time, has learned to cook for
her.
   She models at least once a week, often for high-level groups,
including the National People's Congress, the country's
legislature. The styles are designed for her age group. Below-knee,
A-line coats and dresses with high collars feature heavily in Lu
Shiying's designs.
   Sharing the catwalk with young models less than half her age can
be a real trial.
   ``But, what do you know, we older models get the most
applause,'' she said. ``People tell us that our beauty is
different. We represent China's elderly.''
   ``My legs and eyes are bad,'' she said. ``I'm old and ugly. But
my heart is young.''

<HEAD>Seeds Can Be Saved and Used Another Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most leftover flower or vegetable seeds are quite
useable for another season in the home garden. Saving seeds from
your own plants can be a different ball game. But either way, a few
rules point the way to success or indicate why it's not worth the
effort.
   Vegetable seeds that are fairly simple to store at home for
three to five years include tomato, pea, bean, lettuce, beet,
cabbage, cauliflower, radish, carrot, cucumber, watermelon, squash,
spinach and eggplant.
   Long storage also is possible for flower seeds such as marigold,
zinnia, pansy, petunia, verbena and alyssum.
   Onion, sweet corn, parsley, strawflower and candytuft are among
those with the shortest shelf-lives.
   The technical details of seed saving fill countless books, and,
as in all human endeavors, there can be varying degrees of success.
In general, the fresher the seed the better the germination.
   However, home gardeners are not likely to notice much difference
from held-over seeds and probably will need to thin excess
seedlings, as always, if they follow the seedpacket's planting
instructions.
   A simple test of seed viability is to put a pinch of seeds from
a packet on a moist paper towel, fold the seeds inside and keep the
towel moist for fiitethru   10-29 0313

   A gunman opened fire in a crowded church
basement, wounding seven of the 300 people gathered for a social
event. Detectives questioned the victims today to try to determine
the motive.
   Police Constable Bruno Vaillancourt said three women and four
men were shot and wounded, but none critically. The shootings
occurred early Sunday at a Jamaican-Canadian gathering at St.
Pascal Baylon Roman Catholic Church.
   Police did not identify the gunman or the victims, but said the
suspect was a man in his mid-20s.
   Constable Charles Morrisseau said the investigation is
proceeding slowly because many witnesses were reluctant to talk to
the police. ``Nobody wants to say anything,'' he said.
   Vaillancourt said three people already had been taken to the
hospital by the time police arrived at the church shortly after
1:30 a.m. Sunday. The most seriously injured person suffered a
bullet wound behind the ear. The others were wounded in the
abdomen, hands and feet.
   While the police said they did not know the reason for the
shootings, the church pastor suggested rival gangs might be
involved.
   The Rev. Louis Levasseur said fighting among rival black groups
has been a problem for the eight years he has been at the church.
The elderly priest also said the problems only occur when
English-speaking black groups rent the hall for special events.
   ``We rent the hall to Latin-Americans, Asians and Haitians and
never have any problems,'' Levasseur said.
   The race and language of the group that rented the hall at the
time of the shootings were not immediately reported.
   ``This is not the first time there have been gunshots and people
hurt,'' said Levasseur. Shots were fired in the hall five or six
months ago, but no one has been injured in about a year and a half,
he said.
   He suggested the church may have to stop renting the hall to
English-speaking black groups ``at the risk of being labeled
racist. ''

dodging a hostile takeover bid from a third utility.
   Under an agreement announced Sunday, Kansas Power and Light will
pay $32 in cash and stock for each share of KG&amp;E, which would value
the deal at about $1.04 billion. Kansas City Power and Light Co.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal deficit soared to $220.4 billion,
the second highest ever, in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, the
Treasury Department reported.
   It was the 21st straight year in which the government spent more

   Magazine publishers say they've found a way to
beat the high cost of delivering: They're doing it themselves.
   A few small alternative magazine delivery systems have popped up
over the last few years, but now one of the industry's heavy
hitters - Time Warner Inc. - has entered the picture.
   The publishing industry says if Time's system prospers, more
companies could follow and eventually provide significant
competition for the U.S. Postal Service.
   ``There's no question what the motivation here is,'' said George
Gross, an executive vice president of the trade group Magazine
Publishers of America. ``By building a distribution system you are
saying to the Postal Service that while there is no alternative
now, in time there will be.''
   The magazine industry has been complaining for years that rising
postal rates have been cutting into their profits. Postmaster
General Anthony Frank has acknowledged that postal rates have
increased beyond general inflation, and he has vowed to slow the
pace.
   But the Postal Service maintains it can do a better job of
delivery than alternative systems such as Publishers Express, for
which Time Warner is the managing partner. Eight other equity
partners are involved in the project.
   Begun in Atlanta last year on a trial basis, Publishers Express
now is delivering more than 100,000 magazines, catalogs and
advertisement packages a month to more than 80,000 households
within five ZIP codes. The company has set a goal of 200,000 pieces
a month to 100,000 households by the end of the year.
   From a suburban Atlanta facility, delivery crews sort 24 titles
- including Time, Sports Illustrated, TV Guide, the Atlantic
Monthly and Playboy - and deliver them in sealed packages before
dawn each day.
   Publishers Express cannot use mailboxes under federal law. The
magazines and catalogs are delivered to doorsteps or left at the
base of a mailbox.
   ``If you look at the magazine business, distribution is the only
cost we don't have control over,'' said Howard Rosen, president of
Publishers Express. ``But it's very tough to tell the post office
you don't like their pricing structure. They'd say, `Fine, but
you've got nowhere else to go.' ''
   Since 1970, Rosen said, the cost for second class postage -
which is the rate for newspapers and magazines - has risen 811
percent compared to a general inflation rate of 209 percent over
that time. Third class postage - the rate for most catalogs - has
gone up 364 percent, he said.
   The Postal Service puts the figures a bit lower: 767 percent for
second class and 247 percent for third class.
   Nonetheless, Rosen said, ``It's too cost prohibitive to
distribute our products through the post office.''
   In addition to titles published by Time Warner, the distribution
service has contracted with other magazines and catalogs to deliver
their products, Rosen said. The titles in the designated ZIP code
areas are automatically distributed through Publishers Express,
though consumers may request that the Postal Service take over
their service.
   Postal Service spokesman Bob Hoobing said costs may be higher
but service is reliable.
   ``The fact of the matter is, we have people who are career
workers delivering the mail. We think we're more reliable,'' he
said.
   Hoobing declined to speculate on the impact of such alternative
delivery services. He said about 6.5 percent of the 161.6 billion
pieces of mail handled last year by the Postal Service was second
class.
   If future postal rate increases continue to pinch, ``there will
be more magazines saying (to Time) we want to join you,'' said
Gross, of the Magazine Publishers of America.
   Kofie Q. Dadzie, an assistant marketing professor at Georgia
State University who specializes in distribution systems, said an
operation such as Time's would have to handle an enormous amount of
material to make its costs competitive with the post office.
   ``I'd be interested in finding the cost analysis that said it
would be cheaper,'' Dadzie said. ``I'm surprised.''
   Rosen declined to disclose Publishers Express' income, but he
acknowledged the distribution system must expand if it is to do the
job of the post office at a lower cost.
   ``Clearly at the scale we're at, we are not in a competitive
price situation with the post office,'' he said. ``We need to
double our volume. It can be reached within the next year or
two.''

   Despite a slowing economy and talk of a
recession, consumers haven't been spooked out of spending money for
Halloween.
   All Hallows Eve, the largest money grossing holiday behind
Christmas, is a ``recession-proof'' business, say costume
manufacturers and retailers.
   ``Halloween remains good during all times, whether there's an
economic slowdown or not,'' said Howard Beige, vice president of
sales at Rubies Costume Company Inc. in New York.
   ``During an economic slowdown people may purchase fewer major
appliances and take fewer trips. But when it comes to spending
money on themselves or for a party they do. Halloween survives
recessions very well.''
   Fifty million Americans are expected to celebrate Halloween this
year, estimates Hallmark, the holiday and greeting card giant in
Kansas City, Mo.
   They'll spend $400 million for costumes and accessories and up
to $2 billion once candy, pumpkins and other items are included,
Hallmark said. The company said that's slightly more than what was
spent last year.
   Adults are one reason for the financial success of Halloween,
which dates back to 700 B.C. and the Druids who believed the souls
of the dead returned to mingle with the living on this one night of
the year.
   Halloween is the second most popular adult party occasion behind
New Year's Eve and adults account for 25 percent of all costume
sales, Hallmark said.
   ``Halloween is a party occasion that's continuing to grow,''
said Hallmark spokeswoman Sherry Timbrook. ``A recession or slow
economy won't interfere. People will still seek out fun and
fantasy.''
   ``It's so darn important to have a good time, especially during
bad times,'' said Jack Sheehan, owner of the Costumer, a
73-year-old costume shop in Schenectady, N.Y.
   ``My mother used to tell me that during the depression they'd go
without meat for a week to be able to go to a movie on Saturday
night,'' Sheehan said.
   Glenn Sanders, a psychology professor at the State University of
New York at Albany, said hard times do make the idea of fun more
important. He also said having a good time on Halloween doesn't
involve spending a lot of money.
   ``It's not just that people want to have fun. There's not much
cost associated with Halloween,'' Sanders said. ``People want to
have fun with expensive cars, but that's something that's very much
tied to the economy and whether there's a recession. Halloween
involves a small amount of money relative to Christmas or other
entertainment decisions people will make.''
   Manufacturers and retailers seem to have no apprehensions about
business. Rubies, which manufactures costumes and other Halloween
merchandise, introduced 250 new products this year.
   ``We've seen a moderate increase over last year's sales.
Halloween seems to be selling well,'' said Beige, although he
declined to release sales figures.
   Hallmark said its stores are devoting the same amount of space
to Halloween merchandise this year as they did last year.
   ``People put an emphasis on entertainment. They're not willing
to sacrifice entertainment for themselves,'' said Philip Morris,
president of Morris Costumes in Charlotte, N.C., which distributes
costumes and Halloween wares across the country.
   But just in case, some producers are offering an economy line of
merchandise.
   ``We are offering a lower-price range of costume accessories to
capture more of the market at the lower end,'' Beige said.
   Sheehan, whose store carries many of Rubies products, said he
has noticed some prudence among consumers this year. He said he'll
sell more Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle costumes at $14.98 than he
will at $27.
   ``These lower-priced options exist because of the hard economic
times,'' he said. ``But the volume of business we have makes up for
the fact that we're selling less expensive costumes.''
   Sheehan, who also rents costumes for theatrical productions,
said most of his costumes sell for $25 to $35. Rented costumes for
adults fetch $40.
   Latex masks for $29.95 are another big chunk of Halloween sales.
This year Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini, Fidel Castro and
Gorbachev masks are selling well. Outselling all these, however, is
the ever-popular Richard M. Nixon mask.
   ``It's that shyster image that's made it popular,'' Morris said.
   Halloween producers and retailers insist they aren't likely to
suffer this year, but admit things aren't as they used to be.
   ``The crazy spending of the 1980s is gone. When the dust
settles, not all of us will be here,'' said Sheehan, whose annual
sales total about $1 million.
   Sheehan believes the slowing economy will force many of the
nation's leading chain stores to cut back on the amount of
Halloween merchandise they sell. He said that will allow specialty
stores to recoup business they lost when chains jumped on the
Halloween band wagon in the last decade.
   ``Halloween is over retailed. Maybe a recession will be a
correcting factor,'' Sheehan said.
   Regardless, he said sales at Halloween will always be strong
because consumers are spending money on themselves.
   Morris agreed.
   ``With Christmas, consumers may cut back on things they're going
to buy or the amount they'll spend. The expenditure is not for
themselves,'' he said. ``Halloween is. It's escapism, and it's
fun.''

   You can fly, but you can't hide.
   Business people who think the best part of air travel is that
their office can't find them are in for a disappointment. The
technology is here to track you down.
   Applications were due last week to the Federal Communications
Commission for new systems to provide telephone service to
commercial aircraft.
   Within the next two years, telecommunications companies say, not
only will air passengers be able to place phone calls, they'll be
able to receive them, alng with facsimile messages and data from
portable computers. Some companies describe it as ``the office in
the sky.''
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. and Hughes Network Systems on
Tuesday said they had formed a limited partnership to build and
operate a nationwide phone and data system for commercial aircraft.
   The new service, called Clairtel, would involve 80 ground
stations located around the United States to provide radio links
with aircraft, McCaw spokesman Bob Ratliffe said.
   Clairtel and GTE Airfone Inc. were among companies that filed
for permanent licenses for the aircraft systems by the Oct. 22
deadline, said Jay Jackson, engineering assistant to the FCC's
chief of mobile services.
   Jackson said he did not know all the companies that applied and
would not have a count on the applicants for several days, but he
expected applications from five to 10 companies. All are expected
to get licenses if their paperwork is in order, he said.
   GTE Airfone, a subsidiary of Stamford, Conn.-based GTE, is the
largest operator of airborne pay phones, with 1,300 installed on
planes owned by 17 U.S. and Canadian airlines. It was the first to
enter the market, on Oct. 15, 1984, under an experimental license
from the FCC, spokesman Kevin Petschow said.
   Airfone uses a portable phone based on an aircraft bulkhead or,
in newer versions, at passenger seats. Each plane has a radio
transmitter-receiver and a computer that handles billing and
selects one of 90 GTE ground stations in North America and Hawaii
to establish a radio link. Outside the United States, the phones
work off Comsat's satellite service.
   It's not cheap. Calls anywhere in the United States or Canada
are $2 a minute, plus a $2 setup charge per use.
   So far, calls can only be placed from the aircraft to the
ground. The licenses applied for last week initially will only
permit air-to-ground service, Jackson said.
   But both GTE Airfone and Clairtel have loftier ideas.
   Petschow said Airfone plans to have a ``second-generation''
system in operation by 1992. That will allow calls from the ground
to the aircraft, from one plane to another, and personal computer
hookups, fax transmissions and message services, he said.
Information hotlines, stock information services and other features
also might be added, he said.
   ``Imagine all the things you do in your office, you can do in an
aircraft,'' Petschow said.
   GTE Airfone also plans to offer ``cabin management services''
for air carriers, allowing them to monitor inventory and bill
credit cards over phone links, he said.
   Ratliffe said Clairtel at first would install a system similar
to GTE Airfone's, but eventually wants it to be more a part of
McCaw's cellular system. McCaw, based in the Seattle suburb of
Kirkland, operates one of the nation's largest cellular networks,
with ownership positions in more than 100 markets across the
country.
   The ultra-high-frequency radio bands for cellular phones are
near those assigned to the aircraft phones, so it may be possible
to have a cellular phone that can receive both, he said.
   McCaw is working with other cellular companies to develop a
North American network. With a nationwide switching system, it will
be possible to dial a cellular phone number in Seattle, for
instance, yet find that phone wherever it might be in the nation,
Ratliffe said. Eventually, he added, that could include aircraft.
   ``Let's say I'm on the plane to Miami,'' Ratliffe said. ``It
would ring on the plane. That's what we're trying to get to.''
   Clairtel also envisions computer data transmissions, pager
messages, faxes and other advanced services. Ratliffe said there's
the potential to deliver video entertainment to passengers' seats,
and for phone-toting passengers to dial up drinks or food from the
aircraft galley.
   Jackson, however, has his doubts about how far the sky-high
office might fly, especially if all that high-level talk means more
work for the cabin crew.
   ``I don't think airlines want their attendants becoming a
secretarial service for passengers on the aircraft,'' he said.

   Louisiana has been giving sales tax back to
foreign shoppers for a year now, but while state officials are
thrilled to see more tourists, some of the visitors are frustrated
with red tape.
   The experimental tax-free shopping program has returned $1
million in taxes to foreign tourists, who spent $13 million at the
1,000 participating stores, officials said. The state figures the
vistors' money has brought in $2 to $4 million in tax revenue from
increased economic activity since the program started last Nov. 1.
Hotel, restaurant and transportation taxes are not refunded.
   Officials had expected each foreign shopper to spend about $300
on tax-exempt purchases. However, it's turned out to be almost
triple that and six times what the average U.S. tourist spends,
said Jerry Merlino, head of the program.
   ``For every 1 percent we increase international visitation to
Louisiana, the state would gain $3.5 million in taxes on money
spent on . . . goods and services not eligible for tax refunds,''
said Karen Kelly, marketing and sales director of the program.
   The weakened dollar, which gives foreign tourists more spending
power in this country, has helped bring shoppers, officials
acknowledge. But the sales tax rebate, which in New Orleans amounts
to 9 percent, has given Louisiana an edge, they say.
   While the tourists are spending money, some are leaving angry.
   ``I need my refund now,'' one man argued during 20 minutes of
haggling with the refund clerk at the airport redemption center.
   ``It wasn't explained to me before I began shopping that I
wouldn't be able to get my money immediately,'' said the man, who
would not give his name to a reporter. ``I wanted the cash for when
I traveled. Instead I have to wait for them to mail it to me.''
   Officials said it could take 4 to 6 weeks for mailed refunds to
reach their destinations.
   Jessica Nguyen, an employee at the refund center, said such
complaints are common.
   ``Tourists read the information booklet wrong or misinterpret
the way the tax is calculated,'' she said. ``That's when they leave
dissatisfied.''
   At least one traveler found problems in the stores, too.
   Linda White, an American citizen living in Germany, said getting
a refund didn't seem to be worth the effort for a German companion
of hers.
   ``At one store, everything went smoothly. But to fill out the
vouchers we needed to go to the fourth floor of the store and our
purchase was so small that we decided not to expend the energy.
   ``In another store, one person told us all you have to do is
show your receipts to get your refund. Another said the same thing,
but when we get to the refund center we're met with an entirely
different set of rules,'' she added.
   But for all the gripes, Merlino has success stories: the Central
American man who spent 10,000 on shoes, the Colombian sea captain
and three sailors who spent $40,000 on electrical equipment, two
Paraguayan women spent $11,000 on stock for their boutique and a
group of Canadians abandoned their Florida vacation to go shopping
in Louisiana.
   Early estimates showed 46.2 percent of the participating
tourists were from Mexico. France and Canada ranked second at 19
percent and Japan third at 14 percent.
   Merlino said growing numbers are coming from Central and South
America, England, Australia and West Germany.
   ``The word is spreading like wildfire,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kansas Gas and Electric Agrees to Merge With Kansas Power and
Light</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas Gas and Electric Co. has agreed to a
$1 billion merger with Kansas Power and Light Co., in a move that
could frustrate a hostile takeover effort by another regional
utility company.
   By becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kansas Power and Light,
KG&amp;E would escape being acquired by Kansas City Power and Light
Co., which had been offering $27 a share in an $875 million tender
offer.
   The merger agreement was unanimously approved by directors of
both companies, according to a joint statement released Sunday by
the utilities.
   ``After carefully reviewing all options, (management) has
concluded that this merger serves the best interest of the
company's shareholders, its customers and employees,'' said Wilson
Cadman, chief executive officer of KG&amp;E.
   ``In reaching its decision, the board determined that the
friendly combination with the Kansas Power and Light Company was
not only attractive to our owners, but the two company's people and
assets fit together well, permitting us to better serve our
customers,'' Cadman said.
   In the consolidation, each share of KG&amp;E common stock will be
converted into a total of $32 in cash or Kansas Power and Light
stock, the utilities said.
   ``If KG&amp;E stockholders wish all cash, we can accommodate that up
to $432 million,'' Cadman said. ``If they want all stock, we can
accommodate that, or a combination of each.''
   John E. Hayes Jr., chairman of Kansas Power and Light, said the
utility ``started to look at the consequences of company ownership
as soon as KCPL announced the hostile bid'' in July.
   On Sept. 11, KG&amp;E announced that it was negotiating with a third
party as a means of rebuffing the takeover attempt. It had been
widely believed that KG&amp;E was looking for a ``white knight'' as
KCPL persisted.
   In response to the merger announcement, KCPL spokesman Turner
White said: ``This is the thing that's been anticipated for a long
time. We need to evaluate exactly what the transaction is with
respect to ours.''
   Excess generating capacity of KG&amp;E had been thought to be the
main reason for KCPL's interest in the takeover. KCPL has a rapidly
growing customer base and KG&amp;E has enough excess capacity that
could serve as many as 100,000 additional residential customers.
   Hayes said the merged utilities would make available to KCPL
enough generating capacity to ``fulfill their customer needs into
the late 1990s ... at market rates.''
   Hayes also said customers of KG&amp;E would benefit from a $15
million rate reduction to be sought once the merger is final.
   ``We believe that the combined companies will provide even more
efficient and higher quality service, not only to our current
customers, but also to new business attracted to the area by the
availability of abundant energy at reasonable costs,'' Hayes said.
   KG&amp;E has characterized KCPL's tender offer as illegal and
inadequate.
   KCPL has extended its tender offer three times, reporting
earlier this month that about 44 percent of the KG&amp;E shares had
been tendered.
   If the deal with Kanas Power and Light is completed, KG&amp;E would
continue to maintain its headquarters in Wichita, Hayes said. No
layoffs for either company were expected.
   The merger was subject to approval from state and federal
regulatory authorities.
   Kansas Power and Light is based in Topeka and does business as
KPL Gas Service Co. It has about 1 million customers in Kansas,
western Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma and had revenues of $1.1
billion in 1989.
   KG&amp;E of Wichita has about 250,000 customers in south-central and
southeast Kansas. It had revenues of $533.4 million last year.

<HEAD>Chrysler Reports Loss of $214 Million for Third Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. today reported it
lost $214 million in the third quarter, nearly offsetting the $251
million it earned in the first six months of 1990.
   The loss, which amounts to 95 cents a share, was a little less
than expected by Wall Street analysts, and stemmed mainly from
incentive costs and lower production caused when minivan plants
were retooled.
   The earnings report came as Chrysler faced a midnight expiration
of a contract it negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in
1988.
   During the third quarter of last year, Chrysler earned $331
million, or $1.42 a share. The 1989 results were boosted by a
one-time credit of $309 million from the sale of a stake in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan.
   Chrysler said the third-quarter 1990 loss came on revenues of
$6.5 billion, down 14.5 percent from $7.6 billion during the
July-September period last year.
   The company's third-quarter losses were softened by $83 million
in earnings for Chrysler Financial Corp. That profit, a record for
any third quarter in Chrysler's history, compares with
third-quarter earnings last year of $76 million.
   For the first nine months of the year, Chrysler earned $37
million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $983 million, or $4.21
a share, during the same time last year. Revenue fell 15.4 percent
to $23 billion from $27.2 billion.
   ``We anticipated 1990 would be a tough year for Chrysler and for
the industry, so we launched a major cost-cutting program over a
year ago,'' company Chairman Lee Iacocca said today. ``We didn't
anticipate the Gulf Crisis, the federal budget fiasco or the
continued escalation in the incentive wars, so we've increased our
cost-reduction goals to $2.5 billion over two years.''
   Iacocca has set the target for June 1991.
   Chrysler took its minivan plants in St. Louis and in Windsor,
Ontario, out of service for a month to retool for 1991 models,
damaging profits by reducing wholesale sales to dealers. Minivans
and, to a lesser extent, Jeeps are the bases for Chrysler's
profits.
   The company also is being hit by high incentive costs. The Big
Three would like to end the cash rebates and low-interest
financing, but each is waiting for another to take the first step.
   Ford Motor Co. reports its earnings Tuesday, the same day
General Motors Corp. releases its third-quarter profit figures for
its major subsidiaries and the day before it reports corporate
earnings.
   Analysts have speculated Ford's earnings will be about 47
percent below the $255 million it earned during the quarter last
year, and GM's will be half of the $248 million it made during the
period last year.
  Collectively, third-quarter earnings for the Big Three were
expected to be about 80 percent lower than last year.
   Ford's and GM's overseas earnings continue to sag, analysts have
said, hurting their corporate profits. Nearly all of Chrysler's
operations are in the United States.

   The stock market edged higher today in a subdued
response to Congress's passage of a federal budget plan.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.92 to 2,444.06 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 520 up, 398 down and
475 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.42 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Over the weekend the House and Senate approved a measure
designed to curtail the government's budget deficit, which reached
a near-record $220.4 billion in the fiscal year ended last month.
   President Bush has said he would sign the bill, ending a
prolonged period of wrangling.
   With that uncertainty out of the way, talk has increased that
the Federal Reserve might soon take steps toward at least a slight
easing of its monetary policy.
   But analysts noted that serious problems remain in the
government's fiscal outlook. In addition, investors were confronted
this morning with new increases in world oil prices.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose &rsqb; to 33}; International Business Machines \ to 106~; General
Electric &rsqb; to 50~, and Philip Morris &lsqb; to 46}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .35 to 167.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .20 at 291.19.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.02 to
2,436.14, finishing the week with a loss of 84.65 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 369 up, 1,153 down and 451 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 130.19 million shares, against 141.46
million in the previous session.

   Chrysler Corp. today reported a $214 million
quarterly loss as contract talks with the United Auto Workers
neared a midnight deadline.
   The third-quarter loss nearly wiped out the $251 million the
automaker earned in the first six months of 1990, Chrysler
reported.
   The loss, which works out to 95 cents a share, was a little less

closed for retooling for 1991 models.
   Bargaining was said to be going slowly for the contract that

health care.
   The tone at the talks reportedly turned nasty Sunday. The
Detroit News in today's editions quoted an unidentified bargainer
as saying UAW President Owen Bieber confronted Chrysler's Anthony
St. John, vice president for employee relations.
   ``If you want a strike, you'll get it,'' Bieber told St. John,
Chrysler's chief bargainer.
   Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 automaker, has been under pressure
since the union on Friday gave notice that the contract extension
under which it has been working since mid-September would expire
tonight.
   The union has scheduled a meeting of its 200-member Chrysler
bargaining council for Thursday, during which the local presidents
and bargaining committee chairmen could get an update on the talks,
review a tentative agreement or discuss strike strategy.
   Chrysler made $331 million, or $1.42 a share, during the third
quarter of last year. Those profits were boosted by a one-time
credit of $309 million from the sale of a stake in Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. of Japan.
   ``We anticipated 1990 would be a tough year for Chrysler and for
the industry, so we launched a major cost-cutting program over a
year ago,'' company Chairman Lee Iacocca said today.
   ``We didn't anticipate the Gulf crisis, the federal budget
fiasco or the continued escalation in the incentive wars, so we've
increased our cost-reduction goals to $2.5 billion over two
years,'' Iacocca said.
   Iacocca has set the target for June 1991.
   The UAW has reached three-year contracts with General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. and has said it wants Chrysler to sign the
same pattern agreement, with minor alterations. But the autmaker
has said it may not be able to afford such a contract.
   The pattern agreement calls for, among other things, lump-sum
payments to current retirees and surviving spouses, a method for
increasing pension payments for workers who retired before Oct. 1,
1979, and increases in the amount future retirees will get.
   Of the Big Three automakers, Chrysler has the highest proportion
of retiree costs. It has nearly one retiree for every active
worker. There are about 1.4 active workers for each retiree at GM
and about 1.5 for every Ford retiree.
   When bargaining began in mid-July, Chrysler also said it needed
help from the UAW to cut health-care expenses, which cost the
company about $684 million last year. The pattern agreement has no
change in health-care provisions.

   The tax bill that Congress passed over the
weekend will touch nearly every segment of the American public.
   Most Americans will pay higher taxes, but on their purchases
rather than on their earnings. The bite will be relatively light
for all but the well-to-do. Those with incomes over $200,000 a year
will see their federal tax liabilities rise by an average of 6.3
percent.
   Many of the 70 million couples and individuals with incomes
under $20,000 will get a slight tax cut, thanks to expansion of the
earned-income credit for poorer, working families with children.
   The National Taxpayers' Union, a nonpartisan organization that
campaigns for lower taxes, estimated the bill will boost the taxes
of a $30,000 household by an average of $109. The union, which
figured all households in a certain income bracket, regardless of
size, said a $40,000 household will pay $166 more. At $50,000, it
will pay an extra $214; $70,000, $277 more; $100,000, $542 more,
and households at the $225,000 level will face an average tax
increase of $3,572.
   Here are major provisions, most of which will take effect Jan.
1:
   GASOLINE: Raise the 9-cent gasoline tax to 14 cents a gallon and
the 15-cent diesel tax to 20 cents on Dec. 1. A motorist driving
10,000 miles a year in a car that gets 22 miles per gallon will pay
about $23 more.
   ALCOHOL: Effective Jan. 1, double the beer tax to 32 cents a
six-pack; raise the $12.50-a-gallon tax on 100-proof liquor by $1,
or 20 cents a fifth; raise taxes on most wines, including table
wine, which will go from 3 cents a 750-milliliter bottle to 21
cents.
   TOBACCO: Raise the 16-cent cigarette tax by 4 cents in 1991 and
another 4 cents in 1993. Snuff, cigars and other tobacco will face
25 percent tax increases each year.
   AIR TRAVEL: On Dec. 1, raise to 10 percent the 8 percent tax on
airline tickets, which had been scheduled to drop to 4 percent at
year end. The average round-trip ticket, which costs about $300,
will increase by $6.
   TELEPHONES: Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and
long-distance phone service, which otherwise will expire Dec. 31.
   LUXURIES: On Jan. 1, impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of
the price of cars above $30,000; boats above $100,000; jewelry and
furs above $10,000 and private planes above $250,000. A $40,000
car, for example, will face a luxury tax of $1,000.
   TAX RATES: Effective Jan. 1 (for tax returns to be filed in
1992), raise to 31 percent the 28 percent top income tax rate paid
by the 600,000 couples and individuals with the highest incomes.
That will raise taxes on singles making more than about $125,000 a
year and couples with incomes above the $200,000 range.
   Cut to 31 percent the 33 percent rate that as many as 4 million
upper-middle-income people pay on part of their earnings. This will
reduce taxes for single people with incomes between about $60,000
and $125,000 and couples between about $100,000 and $200,000.
However, other parts of the bill will take back that tax cut in
most cases.
   Raise from 21 percent to 24 percent the alternative minimum tax,
which is paid by fewer than 100,000 high-income people with large
amounts of deductions that otherwise could reduce tax liability to
near zero.
   CAPITAL GAINS: Tax profits from the sale of investments at a
maximum rate of 28 percent. This will provide a break for those
investors who now pay a maximum rate of 33 percent. There is no
deep across-the-board cut in capital gains taxes as President Bush
has demanded.
   ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS: On Jan. 1, reduce by 3 percent the value of
certain itemized deductions that may be written off against
adjusted gross income over $100,000. Only 97 percent of deductions
will be allowed against the portion of income above $100,000; thus
the allowable deduction will be reduced by $300 for each $10,000 of
income above $100,000. The restriction will not apply to deductions
for medical expenses, casualty losses or investment interest. The
provision will affect about 2.5 million couples and individuals.
   EXEMPTIONS: On Jan. 1, reduce personal exemptions - which now
are $2,050 for a taxpayer and each dependent - as adjusted gross
income rises above $100,000 for a single person and $150,000 for a
couple. This will raise taxes for people at those levels. The
exemptions will be reduced by 2 percent for each $2,500 that income
exceeds those thresholds. The exemptions will be lost once income
tops $225,000 (single) or $275,000 (couple).
   LOW-INCOME: Effective Jan. 1, increase the earned-income tax
credit, which benefits about 5 million low-income working families
with children, as a way of offsetting some of the higher excise
taxes.
   MEDICARE TAXES: On Jan. 1, increase to $125,000 the $51,300
maximum annual wage to which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax applies.
This will affect about 8 million wage-earners. The tax is withheld
as part of the Social Security tax and paid by employees and
employers.
   MEDICARE PREMIUMS: Starting Jan. 1, raise the $28.60 monthly
premium for Medicare Part B insurance to $29.90 next year and
$46.20 by 1995. About 30 million elderly and 3 million disabled
people are enrolled in Part B.
   MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE: Also on Jahn. 1, raise to $100 through 1995
the present $75 deductible, which beneficiaries must pay before
Medicare starts paying for doctor bills.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: Require the 3.8 million state and local
government workers not covered by a public pension to pay Social
Security taxes starting next July 1.
   ENERGY INITIATIVES: Starting Jan. 1, provide $2.5 billion worth
of tax incentives for increasing U.S. oil and gas exploration and
production.
   EXPIRING BENEFITS: Increase through 1991, at a five-year cost of
$5.9 billion, 11 targeted tax breaks that are expiring. Principal
beneficiaries include workers who receive tuition aid or group
legal services from employers; businesses that hire the poor;
investors in low-income rental housing; self-employed people who
buy their own health insurance; businesses that increase spending
for research; and low-income people buying a first home.
   BUSINESS: Retroactive to Sept. 30, raise taxes on life insurance
companies by $8 billion. Extend for five years an expiring 0.2
percent surtax that employers pay for unemployment insurance. Raise
the interest rate corporations must pay on overdue taxes, effective
Jan. 1.
   
   PROVISIONS DROPPED&equals;
   The final bill dropped several provisions that had been the
subject of intense negotiations.
   They included: A new tax on home heating oil; forgoing next
year's scheduled ``indexing'' adjustment of tax brackets and
exemptions, which protects against inflation; requiring that
veteran state and local government workers pay the Medicare tax;
imposing a surtax on millionaires; and allowing a special break to
high-income people who donate appreciated art works to museums.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with seven grafs to RECAST lead to CLARIFY meeting

<TEXT>
   Averting a split among the Daily News' newsroom
employees, a group of reporters and photographers decided to remain
on strike today rather than take up an offer to cross picket lines
and reclaim their jobs.
   ``We're willing to give the strike more time,'' reporter Paul
LaRosa said Sunday. ``There's no point in going back now.''
   The News, hit by a walkout last week by nine of its 10 unions,
had said striking workers were welcome to return to their old jobs
at any time as long as permanent replacements had not been hired.
   A group of 40 reporters and photographers belonging to the
750-member Newspaper Guild sent a delegation to discuss the matter
Sunday with Guild President Barry Lipton.
   Some complained that the strike was called on the basis of a
false report that replacements had already been hired to fill
reporting slots.
   ``There's a lot of anger at the Guild leadership,'' said
striking reporter JoAnne Wasserman.
   But after the meeting, the group decided to stay on strike. The
Guild represents reporters, photographers and office workers. It
could not be immediately determined how many Guild members are
honoring the strike.
   No new talks are scheduled. The News has said it plans to
replace the strikers permanently.
   The Daily News, the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily,
has published a paper each day since the strike began Thursday
night but conceded it is having trouble delivering the paper.
   Home delivery was spotty and many newsstands were not getting
the newspaper. ``We have not been hitting all distribution points
as of yet,'' John T. Sloan, the newspaper's chief spokesman, said
Sunday. ``We will soon.''
   He also accused strikers of intimidating dealers and removing
papers from newsstands.
   Strikers have torched delivery trucks and vandalized others.
About 20 strikers have been arrested since the strike began, most
on disorderly conduct charges.
   Workers at the A &amp; S Stationery store in Brooklyn said
club-wielding men had seized all 300 copies of Sunday's News and
scattered them in the gutter. ``I can't take the paper or they will
kill me,'' said one of the store's owners, Ali Najeli.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified management source as
saying many drivers had become lost.
   The News said in a statement Sunday that it published and
distributed more than 1.2 million papers in the city and
surrounding suburbs, exceeding Saturday's press run by 500,000. The
News normally prints 1.46 million Sunday papers.
   The 71-year-old daily has been in a financial tailspin for the
past decade. The News has lost about $115 million and seen daily
circulation slip by about 700,000 since 1980. It recently lost its
standing as the nation's largest metropolitan daily to the Los
Angeles Times.
   The strike began Thursday night when 60 drivers at the News were
replaced in a dispute over whether a driver would be allowed to
monitor a conveyor belt while sitting down. All but one union
followed suit. Members of the Typographical Union have continued
working because they have guaranteed lifetime jobs.
   The unions claimed management provoked the crisis, which
followed 10 months of often stormy talks on contracts to replace
those that expired in March.

<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. today announced a
broad-based management shakeup that should help the nation's
largest securities firm rein in costs but may result in the loss of
several hundred jobs.
   The move includes establishing six core business divisions that
will replace the two-sector structure that has been in place since
1984. The new divisions, each with a new executive vice president,
are: private client, asset management, insurance, investment
banking, debt markets and equity markets.
   While a Merrill spokesman said the restructuring is not ``a
layoff-driven process,'' he added that the firm is ``committed to
reducing our cost base wherever possible.'' The move is expected to
save the firm ``tens of millions of dollars'' over an unspecified
period of time, he added.
   The spokesman said that the new vice presidents ``are going to
go forward to see where they can consolidate support operations.''
While there are no specific layoffs targeted, he did say that some
jobs could be eliminated where there are redundancies.
   ``It's possible over the next several months that they will
reduce the work force by several hundred,'' he said.
   Earlier this year, a top Merrill executive told analysts that
under a worst-case scenario - that is, if business conditions
continue to deteriorate - the firm would consider furloughing 10
percent of its staff. At the peak in 1987, Merrill's payroll
totaled 50,000; the firm currently employs 39,000.
   The spokesman noted that over the past year Merrill has been
``resizing our businesses as market conditions required. That
process will continue, and we expect to be even more focused under
the new structure.''
   The six new divisions will not operate autonomously. Under the
two-sector structure, Merrill's individual-investor operations were
separate from its capital markets group, which failed to foster
cooperation between the two groups, reports said.
   The newly elected executive vice presidents are Barry Friedberg,
49, who will head investment banking; David Komansky, 51, equity
markets; Roger Vasey, 54, debt markets, and Arthur Zeikel, 58,
asset management.
   Two current executive vice presidents will head the other core
business divisions: John Steffens, 49, private client, and Thomas
Patrick, 47, insurance.
   Separately, two current executive vice presidents will head new
support divisions. They are Jerome Kenney, 49, corporate strategy
and research, and Herbert Allison Jr., 47, finance and
administration.
   All will also serve on the firm's executive management
committee.
   ``The new structure elevates key strategic ares of opportunity,
further streamlines the organization, and elevates the role of our
core line managers in directing business strategies and contolling
costs,'' said Merrill Chairman and Chief Executive William Schreyer
and President Daniel Tully in a statement.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Hotel Tax Foes Lose Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opponents of a Philadelphia hotel room tax
lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments the tax
unlawfully interferes with interstate commerce and unfairly
discriminates against those who live outside the city.
   Among those challenging the tax were members of a libertarian
group called Liberty Forum, a Wall Street Journal editor and a
business consultant.
   They said the tax violates their rights by forcing them to
contribute to the construction of a proposed $523 million
Philadelphia Convention Center.
   The Philadelphia City Council, authorized by a state law, raised
the tax in 1986 on hotel room rentals from 3 percent to 5 percent.
The rate is to go to 6 percent after substantial completion of the
convention center.
   The higher taxes are to help finance the center's construction,
although most of the money for the project is to come from other
sources.
   Challenging the tax were Liberty Forum members John Famularo and
Linda Morrison of Philadelphia; Wall Street Journal editor John
Fund, who lives in Jersey City, N.J.; Richard Broglino, a business
consultant from Lexington, Mass.; and Stuart Kessler, a New York
City architect.
   They said the tax is unconstitutional because it applies only to
those who stay at a hotel 30 days or less. The great majority of
hotel patrons subject to the tax are out-of-state residents, they
said.
   A Pennsylvania state court upheld the tax last year. The state
court said the higher taxes paid by those challenging the levy are
``minimal when compared to the prospective good to be achieved by
both (city) residents and visitors alike.''
   The case is Morrison vs. Pennsylvania Convention Center
Authority, 90&equals;377.

   The stock market gained ground today,
registering some encouragement over Congress's passage of a federal
budget plan.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 18.32 to 2,454.46
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 736 up, 494 down and
469 unchanged.
   Over the weekend the House and Senate approved a measure
designed to curtail the government's budget deficit, which reached
a near-record $220.4 billion in the fiscal year ended last month.
   President Bush has said he would sign the bill, ending a
prolonged period of wrangling.
   With that uncertainty out of the way, talk has increased that
the Federal Reserve might soon take steps toward at least a slight
easing of its monetary policy.
   But analysts noted that serious problems remain in the
government's fiscal outlook. In addition, investors were confronted
this morning with new increases in world oil prices.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose &rsqb; to 33}; International Business Machines ~ to 107{; General
Electric } to 51\, and Philip Morris \ to 46~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .96 to 167.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .45 at 291.04.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.79 million shares at
midmorning.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, mainly
reflecting good fieldwork weather in most U.S. agricultural areas.
   Dry conditions allowed Midwestern farmers to harvest more of
their corn and soybeans over the weekend and mild temperatures in
the Great Plains were beneficial for newly planted winter wheat,
analysts said.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain
trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said farmer sales of
corn and soybeans increased slightly over the weekend, which
prompted further selling of futures contracts this morning.
   Corn and soybean harvesting is expected to proceed at a rapid
pace this week before precipitation returns to the Midwest this
weekend.
   Traders will get an update on the harvest in a weekly
Agriculture Department report scheduled for release after the
close.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2{ cents lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $2.61} a
bushel; corn was } cent to 1 cent lower with December at $2.27 a
bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2{ cents lower with December at
$1.17} a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 3} cents lower with
November at $5.92{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures fell sharply,
reflecting weak cash markets.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .30 cent lower with December at
77.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .22 cent lower
with November at 87.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent to
1.20 cents lower with December at 51.75 cents a sound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.45 cents to the permitted daily limit of 2 cents
lower with February at 60.97 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Friday. Pork futures fell.

   Louisiana led the way this week as the number of
working oil and gas rigs in the United States rose 18 to 1,107, an
industry report said Monday.
   The toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. reported the latest count was up
from 1,010 a year ago. Last week, the count improved by 33 to
1,089.
   Louisiana added nine rigs for the week, while Oklahoma, Wyoming,
California, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas also added rigs.
Counts in other major producing states remained unchanged.
   Baker Hughes has kept track of the rig count since 1940. It is a
widely watched index of drilling activity and represents the number
of rigs actively exploring for oil, not those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.

<HEAD>Oil Back Up As Soviets Fail to Sway Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices shot up more than $1 per barrel today
as traders expressed concern over the apparent failure of Soviet
diplomatic efforts in the Persian Gulf.
   In early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light
sweet crude oil was up $1.49 to $34.50 per barrel on contracts for
December delivery. Later delivery contracts were all trading higher
in light volume.
   ``There was a lot of speculation over the weekend that there
could be some progress made,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst
with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. ``Whether it's true or not,
people are saying this may be the last chance before some military
action is necessary. The thinking is if the Soviets can't get Iraq
to change, who can?''
   The Soviet Union and Iraq had once had close ties, but the
Soviets nonetheless lined up with the rest of the global community
in condemning Iraq for its invasion and occupation of neighboring
Kuwait in August.
   Soviet Middle East troubleshooter Yevgeny Primakov met with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Sunday and was said to
have made little progress in resolving the crisis.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze had suggested a day earlier that Iraq may have
softened its stand. But after Sunday's talks between Primakov and
Saddam, Shevardnadze said he saw no reason for optimism.
   Some traders were taking things easy today as they waited to see
an interview with Saddam that Cable News Network was to air this
evening, according to Brendan Dolan, a broker with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Even though oil was higher this morning, traders said the market
did not seem to have the strong momentum that has at times sent it
surging. Early in today's session, crude was up as much as $1.84
per barrel, but it began losing some of that ground late in the
morning.
   As crude moved up, so did futures contracts for refined
petroleum products.
   Home heating oil was up 4.30 cents to 92.55 cents a gallon for
November contracts, with all later delivery months trading higher.
   Unleaded gasoline contracts were higher for all delivery months,
with November delivery contracts rising 4.23 cents to 95.70 cents
per gallon.
   Natural gas was down 0.3 cent to $2.445 per 1,000 cubic feet on
December delivery contracts. Most later contracts were trading
lower.

<HEAD>Judge Permits Company To Pay Suppliers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled Southland Corp. can pay
bills owed its suppliers and keep its 7-Eleven convenience store
chain operating while it goes through bankruptcy reorganization.
   The special order allows the Dallas-based Southland to pay $220
million to vendors for beer, chips, soft drinks and other supplies.
Judge Harold Abramson approved the order Friday.
   Southland incurred the debts before it filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act last Wednesday.
   The judge approved a ``deposit of payment'' with the court in an
amount equal to the outstanding debts, said Southland spokeswoman
Cecilia Stubbs Norwood on Sunday.
   Vendors in return agreed to continue offering Southland normal
credit terms while the company struggles to emerge from
reorganization.
   Ms. Norwood said vendors can be forced to return payments to
Southland if they refuse to offer customary
from the bench for the first time today, about half an hour into
the ninth oral argument of his new tenure.
   Souter asked two questions in a case in which the court is to
decide whether federal officials should have additional authority
to deny temporary legal status to immigrant farmworkers.
   The questions centered on how long farmworkers who believe their
rights have been violated must wait for administrative hearings.
   And Souter asked a few other questions in the following case,
one in which the court must decide whether passengers on
international flights may sue airlines for the emotional distress
they allegedly suffer in near-crashes that cause them no physical
harm.
   Souter, who joined the court Oct. 9, had not spoken from the
bench through eight hours of argument sessions.
   For the record, his first words from the bench came at 10:31
a.m.

<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. on Monday joined
competitors who have unveiled lightweight laptop computers
featuring an increasingly popular microprocessor.
   The new notebook-size computer, called Travelmate 3000, costs
less than one with a similar chip announced two weeks ago by Compaq
Computer Corp.
   The Texas Instruments machine has less memory than Compaq's
LTE386s-20, but it's lighter at 5.7 pounds and has a bigger screen.
In addition, the TI machine includes the DOS operating system,
which costs extra on the Compaq model.
   DOS is used on International Business Machines Corp. computers
and compatible models. An operating system is the base layer of
software that controls a computer's internal functions.
   Dallas-based Texas Instruments will make the computer at its
plant in Temple, about 130 miles south of Dallas. The company also
announced production of new laser printer at the plant.
   The brain of the new laptop, which will be available in
November, is a less costly version of Intel's 386 microprocessor
called the 386SX.
   The computer measures 8.5 by 11 by 1.8 inches and has a 10-inch
diagonal display and one floppy diskette drive. A unit with a
20-megabyte hard disk drive has a list price of $5,499, while one
with a 40-megabyte hard disk drive lists for $5,999.
   The comparable models made by Houston-based Compaq cost up to
$6,999, and weigh 7.5 pounds. Epson America Inc. and the Grid
division of Tandy Corp. also offer laptops based on the 386SX chip.
   The new laser printer, called microLaser XL, prints up to 16
pages per minute. Three models, priced from $3,449 to $4,499, are
available.
   The printer is built for IBM-compatible computers, but a $145
device will allow it to be used with Apple Computer Inc. machines.

   The stock market showed some scattered gains
today in a muted response to Congress's passage of a federal budget
plan.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.13 to 2,448.27
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers just barely outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 636 up, 634 down and
533 unchanged.
   Over the weekend the House and Senate approved a measure
designed to curtail the government's budget deficit, which reached
a near-record $220.4 billion in the fiscal year ended last month.
   President Bush has said he would sign the bill, ending a
prolonged period of wrangling.
   With that uncertainty out of the way, talk has increased that
the Federal Reserve might soon take steps toward at least a slight
easing of its monetary policy.
   But analysts noted that serious problems remain in the
government's fiscal outlook. In addition, investors were confronted
this morning with new increases in world oil prices.
   Crude oil for December delivery climbed about $1.50 a barrel, to
the neighborhood of $34.50 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose &rsqb; to 33}; International Business Machines &rsqb; to 107; General
Electric | to 51&lsqb;, and Pfizer } to 75&lsqb;.
   Merrill Lynch, which outlined plans for a corporate realignment,
dropped | to 17.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .29 to 167.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.11 at 290.28.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.16 million shares at
noontime, against 61.97 million at the same point Friday.

London's Stock Exchange Monday, with investors unwilling to take

   Investors were kept on the sidelines by the unresolved situation

markets and British corporate profitability, traders said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 1

<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nickels and dimes add up to real money, as
taxwriters know and taxpayers soon will learn. It's a big country,
and every penny counts when multiplied by millions of people.
   If you're a beer drinker, for example, you'll be taxed 16 cents
more for every six-pack you buy - not too bad, you say, until you
get around to the multiplication.
   That additional 16 cents doubles the total federal tax on the
six-pack, bringing the tab on a two-pack-a-week drinker to more
than $33 in a year. To which you might have to add a sales tax and
a bottle or can deposit.
   You probably drive a car as well, and it isn't at all unusual
that you might average 250 miles a week or 13,000 miles a year, and
that your vehicle gets about 25 miles to a gallon.
   That means your buggy consumes 10 gallons a week or 250 gallons
a year, on which you'll be paying a 14-cent-a-gallon tax of $1.40 a
week or nearly $73 a year, not counting what your state might add
to the bill.
   In an effort to avoid such tabs, you might think of leaving the
car behind and traveling by air on your vacation, but you still
will take along Uncle Sam. Effective Dec. 1, the ticket tax goes to
10 percent from 8 percent.
   You might say this nibbling at your wallet could drive you to
drink, but even then you won't escape. The tax on a bottle of table
wine rises to 21 cents from 3 cents, and for a fifth of whiskey to
nearly $2.15.
   Cigarettes offer no relief either, because you'll be paying an
additional 4 cents a pack after January 1, which would add nearly
$15 a year to your bill if you're a pack-a-day user.
   Taxes such as these slip up on you deceptively; the units are in
pennies but the multiples are in dollars, and when applied so many
times to so many things in life, they tend to mount into the
hundreds of dollars.
   For Uncle Sam, who multiplies the tax on each individual by
millions of individuals, the total tab is in the multibillions of
dollars.
   By such means does ``tax freedom day'' get pushed back. Back in
1945, says the Tax Foundation, you finished paying your obligations
to Uncle Sam by April 1. From New Year's until that date, in
theory, you were working for Sam.
   By 1965, freedom day was delayed until April 28, and this year
it occurs around May 5, meaning the average taxpayer labored 125
days to finance his indigent uncle, a gentleman attuned more to
spending than restraint.
   That might be irritating, you might say, but at least you have
some of the year's paycheck left for yourself. Yes, but the trend
is ominous, and budget summitry isn't likely to change that trend.
   For the sixth time in nine years the White House and Congress
used summitry in an attempt to reduce the federal deficit. To date,
says the foundation, ``a summit-arranged budget has never even
reduced the deficit below the level of the summit year.''
   In short, don't expect freedom day to occur much earlier next
year. The 1990 cost of running Congress itself rose 10.6 percent
over 1989, bringing the price tax to $2.3 billion. That's the
trend.
   You might need no reminder of it than the hole in your pocket
and the extra days you spend working for Uncle Sam.

   Barclays Bank PLC said Monday it plans to
streamline its domestic retail branch operations over the next five
years by closing 110 offices and trimming 1,800 staff through
attrition.
   The office cuts, mostly in urban centers, amount to slightly
more than 4 percent of Barclays' network of 2,600 retail bank
branches in Britain, while the staff cuts represent 1.5 percent of
its total domestic workforce of 87,000.
   Barclays said 1,300 of the jobs would be cut from clerical
staff, and the rest from management.
   Britain's major commercial banks have been moving to trim staff
and unprofitable branch operations in the past year in an effort to
cut operating costs and squeeze greater profit out of existing

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. on Monday announced a
computer system that will allow companies to combine the control of
their manufacturing processes with their air conditioning and
heating systems.
   Honeywell says the new system could cut energy costs, reduce
waste and improve efficiency.
   Companies that would benefit most are those whose products are
extremely sensitive to temperature, air quality, humidity and other
environmental factors. Among them are computer-chip makers,
pharmaceutical manufacturers, food processors and textile firms,
Honeywell said.
   ``Our most visionary customers have been asking for the
capability to integrate systems,'' said Joe E. Chenoweth, president
of the Honeywell division that developed the technology. ``Simply
put, it allows companies to better understand and control their
manufacturing environments and, as a result, to be more productive
and competitive.''
   The Minneapolis-based company makes controls for manufacturing
processes as well as heating and air conditioning systems. It also
makes security systems and equipment for the space and aviation
industries.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Rise on Soviet Purchase Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices rose slightly Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of Soviet buying interest, but
other grain and soybean futures finished modestly lower.
   The weak corn rally marked a renewal of speculation that the
Soviet Union is in the market for U.S. corn to complete its
commitment to buy 1 million metric tons by the end of the year.
   The Soviets bought 350,000 metric tons of U.S. corn earlier this
fall. They are required to buy another 650,000 metric tons this
year to honor their long-term grain agreement.
   The market talk on Monday was that the Soviets might have bought
500,000 metric tons, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   The other markets were pressured by perceptions that dry, mild
weather would allow soybean harvesting to advance in the Midwest
and benefit newly planted winter wheat in the Great Plains.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $2.61\ a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $2.28}
a bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents lower with December at

   Oil prices moved above $34 per barrel in light
trading on the futures market Monday, amid concerns that a Soviet
peace effort in the Persian Gulf had failed.
   ``It was perhaps one of the last-ditch efforts to get a peaceful
resolution,'' said Christian Gohler, a vice president with Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures. ``As a result, the market moved higher.''
   Light sweet crude oil rose $1.67 to $34.68 per barrel for
December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts
for later months also settled higher.
   Traders said Monday's session was one of the quietest they could
remember in the volatile weeks that followed Iraq's invasion and
occupation of Kuwait in August.
   Although there was no strong news to move the market, prices
opened higher and held their ground on reports of the unsuccessful
Soviet efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
   ``There was a lot of speculation over the weekend that there
could be some progress made,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst
with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. ``Whether it's
true or not, people are saying this may be the last chance before
some military action is necessary. The thinking is, if the Soviets
can't get Iraq to change, who can?''
   The Soviet Union and Iraq once had close ties, but the Soviets
nonetheless lined up with the rest of the global community in
condemning Iraq for its attack on Kuwait.
   Soviet Middle East envoy Yevgeny Primakov met with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Sunday. Following those
talks, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said he saw no
reason for optimism in the gulf.
   Some traders stayed on the sidelines Monday as they waited to
see an interview with Saddam that Cable News Network was to air
Monday evening. Oil prices hit their lows for the day on the Merc
when players learned from an excerpt of the interview that Saddam
was apparently refusing to rule out the idea of a diplomatic
resolution to the crisis.
   ``He was saying peace was still possible,'' said Ed Kevelson, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Crude's increase early in the day was mirrored in the futures
prices for refined petroleum products. Home heating oil settled
3.11 cents higher at 91.36 cents a gallon for November delivery.
Contracts for later months all closed higher.
   Unleaded gasoline settled up .96 cent at 92.43 cents per gallon
for November, with other delivery months trading higher.
   Natural gas futures were off for the day, with the December
contract falling 1.4 cents to $2.434 per 1,000 cubic feet.

   The dollar settled mostly higher on world
currency markets Monday, but traders complained that dealings were
dull.
   Gold prices advanced after falling overseas. On the New York
Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at
$373.70 a troy ounce, up $2.80 from Friday's close. Republic
National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $373.65, up $2.65 an
ounce.
   Traders said that despite the advance, the dollar remained
within its current trading range. With no fresh news to direct
trading, ``there was no reason to sell and no reason to buy,'' said
Robert Ryan, a senior trader at the Bank of New York.
   At midday the Federal Reserve bought $1 billion in Treasury
bills while the federal funds rate, the interest rate charged on
overnight loans, was at 7} percent. The move signaled to the
financial markets that the Fed had eased by \ point.
   Though lower interest rates usually are bearish for the dollar
because they diminish the value of dollar-denominated securities,
traders discounted the Fed's action.
   ``The market had been anticipating an easing, and the dollar had
been falling on that,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice president at
Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, noting that any easing
already had been discounted in the currency markets.
   The Fed had made an easing of its credit policy contingent on
the passage of a budget measure.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 127.35 Japanese yen from
128.50 yen at Friday's close. Later in London, it was quoted higher
at 127.80 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 128.65 yen, up
from 128.25 yen on Friday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9525 from $1.9555 late
Friday. In New York, one pound cost $1.9490, less expensive than
Friday's $1.9565.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates included: 1.5220 German marks, up from 1.5130; 1.2920 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2810; 5.0930 French francs, up from 5.0670;
1,140.50 Italian lire, up from 1,134.00; and 1.1635 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1644.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates included: 1.5170 German marks, up from 1.5155; 1.2865 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2795; 5.0775 French francs, up from 5.0740;
1.7090 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7083; 1,136.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,135.50; and 1.1640 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1653.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $372.75 a troy ounce from
$373.75 late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $372.50 an ounce from
$373.40. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.80 an ounce to close
at $371.16.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.127 a troy ounce, up from $4.050
on Friday. But in London the metal slipped to a late bid of $4.10 a
troy ounce, from $4.14.

   Stock prices fell Monday as traders found little
inspiration in Congress's passage of a federal budget plan.
   The battered banking group suffered some of the day's most
notable losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 20 points in
the early going, closed with minus-5.94 reading at 2,430.20.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
486 up, 1,037 down and 451 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 133.98 million
shares, against 130.19 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 168.62 million shares.
   Over the weekend the House and Senate approved a measure
designed to curtail the government's budget deficit, which reached
a near-record $220.4 billion in the fiscal year ended last month.
   President Bush has said he would sign the bill, ending a
prolonged period of wrangling.
   With that uncertainty out of the way, talk has increased that
the Federal Reserve might soon take steps toward at least a slight
easing of its monetary policy.
   But analysts noted that serious problems remain in the
government's fiscal outlook. In addition, investors were confronted
Monday with new increases in world oil prices.
   Crude oil for December delivery climbed $1.67 a barrel to $34.68
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   In the banking sector, Manufacturers Hanover dropped { to 16{ on
top of a 3-point slide Friday. Recent comments from the company
have been interpreted as suggestions that a dividend cut is
possible.
   Elsewhere in the group, Security Pacific fell ~ to 17}; Chase
Manhattan \ to 10}; Mellon Bank ~ to 18&lsqb;; Banc One 1\ to 19\, and
Bank of New York 1| to 14{.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Pepsico dropped } to 23;

   Merrill Lynch, which outlined plans for a corporate realignment,

   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric rose 1~ to 26~. The company, fighting a
hostile takeover bid by Kansas City Power &amp; Light, struck a deal to
merge with Kansas Power &amp; Light for $32 a share in cash and stock.
   Kansas Power &amp; Light shares dropped 1&rsqb; to 20{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $26.84 billion, or 0.94
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 1.47 to 165.24.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.05 to 355.45, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.83 at 301.88.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 3.56 to 330.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 288.79, down 2.60.

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. announced a sweeping
management overhaul Monday that could lead to several hundred job
cuts at the nation's biggest securities firm.
   The reorganization replaces Merrill's separate consumer and
capital markets groups with six business divisions, eliminating a
structure in place since 1984.
   It also creates a mechanism for Merrill to replace company
chairman and chief executive William A. Schreyer, who is to retire
in 1993 at age 65. Schreyer took over Merrill in 1985.
   Analysts said the move reflects a renewed emphasis on individual
investors and other clients over the creation of new products.
Investment banking fields such as junk bonds and merchant banking
created large profits in the mid-1980s, but have slumped in the
last three years.
   ``Everybody has next to nothing or negative profits on the
institutional side,'' said Perrin Long, an industry analyst with
Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
   Schreyer and Merrill President Daniel Tully said in a statement
that the new structure will focus management ``as closely as
possible on meeting the needs and exceeding the expectations of the
key client groups we serve.''
   Merrill's stock fell 87{ cents Monday to close at $16.75 on the
New York Stock Exchange, after dropping $1.75 on Friday. The stock
closed on Oct. 16 at $16.12{, its lowest level since the first
quarter of 1980.
   The six new business divisions, each run by an executive vice
president, are private client, asset management, insurance,
investment banking, debt markets and equity markets. Each will
operate under the full Merrill name.
   Merrill spokesman Fred Yager said the reorganization was not
designed to reduce staff, but that several hundred jobs may be
reduced in the next several months as support staff operations are
consolidated. Merrill has 39,000 employees, down from a peak of
50,000 in 1987.
   A top Merrill executive told analysts earlier this year that if
business conditions continued to deteriorate the firm would
consider furloughing 10 percent of its staff.
   The restructuring was the second at Merrill this year. The firm
in January took a $470 million charge against earnings to pay for
an overhaul that included about 3,000 layoffs and the shutdown of
several business lines.
   Merrill earlier this month reported third-quarter earnings of
$46.1 million, or 38 cents a share. That was down 38 percent from
the second quarter but 6 percent higher than an especially weak
1989 third quarter.
   Yager said the latest restructuring is expected to save Merrill
``tens of millions of dollars'' over an unspecified period of time.
The firm will continue to evaluate its businesses under the January
restructuring, he said.
   The six new divisions will operate within the overall management
of the firm. Under the two-sector structure, Merrill's
individual-investor operations and capital markets group operated
autonomously.
   John Steffens, 49, an executive vice president in charge of
Merrill's consumer markets operation, will run the private-client
division, which deals with individual investors and small- and
medium-sized business.
   One other executive vice president, Thomas Patrick, 47,
currently chief financial officer, will head the insurance
division.
   The newly elected executive vice presidents are Barry Friedberg,
49, who will head investment banking; David Komansky, 51, equity
markets; Roger Vasey, 54, debt markets; and Arthur Zeikel, 58,
asset management.
   The apparent loser in the shuffle is Jerome Kenney, 49, who
headed the capital markets division since 1984 and will run a new
support division in corporate strategy and research. Another
executive vice president, Herbert Allison Jr., 47, will head a
support division on finance and administration.
   All will serve on the firm's executive management committee,
which will assist in the search for a successor to Schreyer.

   Chrysler Corp. reported a $214
million third-quarter loss Monday, a performance that would have
been worse without record earnings at the company's financial
subsidiary.
   The earnings report, which showed Chrysler did better by loaning
money than by building and selling cars, underscored its
difficulties as the No. 3 Detroit automaker negotiates with the
United Auto Workers to reach a new contract.
   Chrysler is the last and weakest of the Big Three to negotiate
with the UAW and has said it can't be as generous as rivals General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   Chrysler reported a third-quarter loss of 95 cents a share,
compared to $331 million, or $1.42 a share, in the 1989 quarter.
That period included a one-time, $309 million credit from the sale
of some stock in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Chrysler now holds an 11
percent share of the Japanese automaker.
   The company said the loss stemmed partly from the cost of cash
rebates and other incentivies aimed at selling cars, as well as the
costs of a one-month shutdown for retooling of Chrysler's two
minivan plants, which make some of the company's best-selling
vehicles.
   By contrast, Chrysler Financial Corp., which handles consumer
car loans, earned $83 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, its
best performance ever.
   The third-quarter loss came on revenues of $6.5 billion, down
14.5 percent from $7.6 billion recorded in July through September
last year.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Chrysler earned $37 million,
or 17 cents a share, compared with $983 million, or $4.21 a share,
last year. Revenue fell 15.4 percent to $23 billion from $27.2
billion.
   ``Chrysler lost a little less in the third quarter than I
expected,'' said auto analyst David Healy of the investment bank
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, noting that Chrysler Financial ``did a good
deal better than I expected.''
   Healy also noted that Chrysler does not plan to close its St.
Louis I assembly plant as soon as expected. Last year, Chrysler
targeted a September 1990 shutdown, but since pushed the closing
back to May 1991, the end of production for the Chrysler LeBaron
coupe and convertible and the Dodge Daytona.
   Healy said Chrysler Treasurer Jerry York told Wall Street
analysts Monday that the company's cost-cutting pace has
accelerated now that 1991 models are in production. Much of the
saving is tied to more efficient manufacturing operations for the
1991 models, which officially debuted Oct. 1.
   York also said incentive costs for the automaker should begin to
ease.
   ``It was about $1,200 (per vehicle) for the second quarter and
$1,250 for the third quarter,'' Healy said. ``It will be maybe a
little less than that in the fourth quarter.''
   Chairman Lee Iacocca blamed a variety of events for the
third-quarter loss.
   ``We anticipated 1990 would be a tough year for Chrysler and for
the industry, so we launched a major cost-cutting program over a
year ago,'' he said in a statement. ``We didn't anticipate the Gulf
crisis, the federal budget fiasco or the continued escalation in
the incentive wars, so we've increased our cost-reduction goals to
$2.5 billion over two years.''
   Iacocca has set the cost-cutting target for June 1991.
   Chrysler stock rose on the earnings report, but fell back to
close at $11, down 12{ cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Ford was expected to announce third-quarter earnings Tuesday.
They were projected to be slightly more than half of the $477.1
million the company earned during the period last year.
   General Motors Corp. reports major subsidiaries' earnings
Tuesday and corporate earnings Wednesday. The No. 1 automaker is
expected to show a 50 percent drop in third-quarter earnings from
the 1989 level of $516.9 million.

<HEAD>Manville Third-Quarter Profits Down 39 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. said Monday its third-quarter
profits tumbled 39 percent, in part because of a decline in the
domestic construction market.
   Manville, a building products and natural resources company,
reported net income of $24.5 million, or 17 cents per share,
compared with $40.4 million, or 30 cents per share, in the same
1989 period.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, Manville said net sales
rose 4.7 percent to $576 million from $550 million a year ago.
   Manville Chairman and Chief Executive Tom Stephens said the
company's domestic paper business remained steady, but ``we're
feeling the effects of softening in the domestic construction
markets.''
   Manville said the start-up of new operations hurt earnings.
Manville in the third quarter acquired Visypack Pty. Ltd., an
Australian folding cartons maker. Earlier this year, Manville
acquired DRG Cartons Ltd., a British cartons maker, and Fiskeby
Board AB of Sweden, a supplier of boxboard products.
   The company charged $4.8 million in legal and other professional
fees for restructuring a trust fund formed as part of Manville's
1988 bankruptcy court reorganization to compensate asbestos disease
victims.
   Under the resturcturing, announced in September, Manville agreed
to inject up to $520 million over seven years to help the
autonomous Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust meet more
claims. The trust has run out of cash and all payments to victims
have been frozen.
   Manville, once the nation's largest asbestos maker, filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982 because of mounting
lawsuits by victims of lung cancer and other respiratory disease.
Manville no longer makes asbestos.
   In the first nine months of 1990, Manville reported earnings of
$102 million, or 75 cents per share, down 15 percent from $120
million, or 91 cents per share, in the same 1989 period.
   Net sales in the nine-month period were $1.66 billion, up from
$1.62 billion in the year-ago period.
   Manville manufactures building products, fiberglass and
industrial insulation products, paper and wood products, packaging,
roofing systems and filtration and minerals.
   The company has more than 18,000 workers at more than 50 plants
and seven mining interests worldwide.

   Ford Motor Co. said Monday it is recalling
127,000 1987 Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars with
3.8-liter V-6 engines because of excess exhaust emissions.
   Testing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Ford
indicated that the cars produced unacceptable levels of carbon
monoxide at high altitudes and hydrocarbon levels at low altitudes,
the company said.
   Owners are being notified by mail to bring the affected cars to
dealers, who will install a vacuum retard valve and change ignition
timing to correct the problem, at no cost.
   Ford said vehicles built for sale in California and Canada
weren't affected.

<HEAD>Multiple Reasons Seen for Murdoch Magazines' Suspension of Men's
Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murdoch Magazines has blamed a weak economy for
its decision to suspend publication of Men's Life magazine after
one issue.
   Some magazine industry analysts suspect the heavy debt load
carried by the magazine company's parent, News Corp. Ltd., also
played a big role in the decision to halt publication of the
magazine.
   Executives at several magazines aimed at segments of the men's
market, meanwhile, said Monday they are staying the course despite
what they concede is a tough advertising climate.
   Men's Life was launched in September, targeted at men aged
between 40 and 50 years old with moderate incomes. The first issue
carried a cover photo of a woman in a baseball catcher's gear to
illustrate a story ``Safe at Home'' that said most men would
remarry their wives if given a second chance.
   Other stories asked ``Do we all become our fathers?'' and ``What
is it about blondes?''
   Murdoch Magazines President Leslie Hinton said in annoucing the
suspension last Friday that reader response to the first issue was
encouraging but added it was ``too costly to go ahead in the
present economic environment.''
   He said the magazine would be back ``when the economy
improves.''
   Men's Life was one of several general interest men's magazines
that were either started or repositioned in recent months.
   The magazines Manhattan Inc. and M were merged into M Inc. and
the nightlife magazine Details was overhauled to appeal to young
men.
   A proposed magazine called Men was sold to the company that
publishes the 2{-year-old title Smart, which becomes ``Smart . . .
for Men'' in January.
   Mitchell Fox, publisher of Details, said the Conde Nast
Publications Inc. magazine has sold 250 pages of ads for the first
five issues since its September relaunch as a men's magazine and
that circulation has exceeded its 100,000 guarantee.
   ``We are certainly not going to pull the plug,'' he said.
   Susan Lodge, publisher of M Inc. aimed at affluent, middle-aged
men, said she sympathized with the backers of Men's Life. ``It's a
terrible time to be starting a magazine,'' she said.
   She said her Capital Cities-ABC Inc. publication benefited from
having two subscriber lists and advertiser lists to use for the
repositioned magazine.
   ``We have every positive sign going for us in a very difficult
business climate,'' she said.
   John Reidy, media analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.,
said the tough advertising environment was mainly responsible for
the suspension of Men's Life.
   Publishers Information Bureau recently reported that advertising
volume was down 3.3 percent for the first nine months of the year
at the 172 magazines it tracks. Ad pages were down 4.5 percent in
September alone.
   Reidy doubted the decision had much to do with the $8 billion
debt at News Corp., the Australian-based parent of Murdoch
Magazines.
   He said the $10 million or so that it would cost to make a
success of Men's Life would not mean much in the context of that
debt burden.
   But Martin S. Walker, an analyst for Periodical Studies Service
Inc., said the suspension does reflect the corporate financial
position of News Corp. ``Sure, it's a drop in the bucket but it is
one more drop. They just don't want to start investing in new
things right now,'' Walker said.
   Murdoch's Hinton was unavailable Monday for elaboration on
Friday's suspension of Men's Life. But he denied through a
spokesman published reports that the magazines Seventeen or
Premiere were up for sale.
   ``None of the Murdoch Magazines are for sale,'' he said.

   The Food and Drug Administration wants to ban
the use of 111 ingredients in non-prescription diet drug products,
including one it says presents a safety hazard.
   That ingredient is guar gum, which is extracted from plant
matter. Three months ago, FDA told the distributor of one brand of
diet table, Cal Ban 3000, that contains guar gum to stop
distributing the tablets because it had received 17 reports of
users suffering from obstruction of the esophagus.
   Aside from those tablets, the agency did not give brand names of
products affected.
   The action does affect guar gum use in small amounts in foods
where it poses no health hazard, foods such as cheese, salad
dressings and ice cream, the agency said.
   The agency said the 111 ingredients had not been proven
effective in diet products. The ban includes alcohol, corn syrup,
dextrose, kelp, pineapple enzymes, rice polishings, saccharin,
salt, sodium bicarbonate, vitamin C and wheat germ.
   FDA said it had given manufacturers opportunities to prove the
ingredients were effective but that it had received no significant
information.
   The proposed ban will be published in Tuesday's Federal Register
along with another proposed ruling that calls for a warning on
general over-the-counter drugs containing water soluble gums like
guar gum.
   That, said FDA ``is also a result of reports of esophageal
obstruction following ingestion of diet and laxative products
containing these ingredients.''
   Products containing such substances, including guar gum,
psyllium, and the like, would have to carry labels warning users to
take them with adequate fluid and to avoid them totally if the user
had ever had difficulty swallowing.
   The agency said it would receive comment on its proposals for 60
days, and any action would not be effective until six months after
its eventual decision.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Post Limit Losses As Demand Fades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hog and pork belly futures prices plunged their daily limits
Monday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting a sharp
downturn in pork demand and expectations for higher hog production
in the fourth quarter.
   On other commodity markets, cattle futures also fell; oil
futures rose; precious metals rose; copper retreated; and grains
and soybeans were mixed.
   Hog futures settled .18 cent to the limit 1.5 cents lower in
Chicago with the contract for delivery in December at 51.45 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.95 cents to the limit 2 cents
lower with February at 60.95 cents a pound.
   Cash hog prices dropped about 1.5 cents a pound as packer buying
interest slackened amid perceptions that retailers plan fewer pork
specials in the coming month, analysts said.
   The sell-off also corresponded to a seasonal decline in consumer
demand for bacon. Bacon demand typically peaks in the warm-weather
months, a phenomenon that some analysts link to increased
consumption of bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwiches.
   Phil Stanley, an independent trader and market consultant for
DEC Futures Inc. of Lincoln, Neb., said expectations for larger hog
production in the fourth quarter also weighed on the market.
   He said the sell-off was exaggerated by speculators.
   Further profit-taking may have reflected end-of-the-month
selling by players who needed cash to pay commission fees, said
Dale Durchholz, livestock analyst with AgriVisor Services Inc. of
Bloomington, Ill.
   Cattle futures also retreated on the Chicago Merc in line with
lower cash cattle prices.
   Live cattle futures settled .55 cent lower to .10 cent higher
with December at 77.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent
to .58 cent lower with November at 87.07 cents a pound.
   Oil prices shot up more than $1 per barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as traders expressed concern over the apparent
failure of Soviet diplomatic efforts in the Persian Gulf.
   ``There was a lot of speculation over the weekend that there
could be some progress made,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst
with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. ``Whether it's true or not,
people are saying this may be the last chance before some military
action is necessary.''
   Light sweet crude oil settled 60 cents to 167 cents higher with
December at $34.68 a barrel; heating oil was 2.35 cents to 3.34
cents higher with November at 91.36 cents a gallon; unleaded
heating oil was .64 cent to 2.6 cents higher with November at 92.43
cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures rose strongly on New York's Commodity
Exchange in a rally that many analysts regarded as a technical
correction after the sharp decline of the last four weeks.
   Gold futures ended $2.10 to $2.80 higher with October at $373.70
a troy ounce; silver was 7.7 cents higher across the board with
October at $4.127 a troy ounce.
   Corn futures prices rose slightly on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid rumors of Soviet buying interest but other grain and soybean
futures finished modestly lower.
   The weak corn rally marked a renewal of speculation that the
Soviet Union is in the market for U.S. corn to complete its
commitment to buy 1 million metric tons by the end of the year.
   The Soviets have bought about 402,000 metric tons of U.S. corn
so far this year, according to the Agriculture Deparment. They were
rumored on Monday to have bought another 500,000 metric tons, said
Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   After the close, the USDA reported that exporters sold more than
320,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans to unknown destinations.
Another 265,000 metric tons of foreign soybeans were sold to
unknown destinations, the USDA said.
   The USDA also released its weekly crop-progress report, which
showed 72 percent of the U.S. soybean crop and 64 percent of the
corn crop harvested as of Sunday.
   The agency said 86 percent of the winter wheat crop was planted
as of Sunday.
   Wheat futures ended 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $2.61\ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cent higher
with December at $2.28{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1 cent lower
with December at $1.19 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4} cents
lower with November at $5.90{ a bushel.

   Minnesota insurance companies would face
some of the strictest financial requirements in the country under
industry-supported recommendations announced Monday by the state
commerce commissioner.
   ``There isn't a crisis out there now, but there are troubled
companies,'' Commissioner Thomas Borman said in releasing a report
from the Minnesota Insurance Solvency Task Force.
   The regulations are intended to boost consumer confidence in
Minnesota insurance companies and prevent insolvencies, which cost
the industry millions of dollars in payments to state guaranty
funds.
   The chief change would limit junk bond holdings to 15 percent of
a company's assets - the country's most stringent restriction on
low or unrated debt securities, Borman said. New York's 20 percent
limit is currently the most restrictive, he said.
   Another proposal would require insurers to mark down the value
of ``distressed'' real estate and real estate loans to market
values. Those reports would be filed with the commissioner's
office, forming the basis for possible targeted examinations.
Borman said he knows of no other state requiring such reports.
   A third recommendation is for companies to follow a new formula
in reporting their capital structures, requiring them to account
for risks related to underwritings and investments. Generally, the
formula would require additions to capital ``as a company invests
in riskier assets,'' Borman said. Utah has a risk-based capital
formula and New York is studying one.
   To enforce the proposed changes, Borman said he would like at
least 30 more insurance regulators on his staff, more than tripling
its size at an annual cost of roughly $1.5 million. Minnesota
insurance executives on the task force said the industry would be
willing to pay for the added expense in the form of increased fees,
but Borman will first seek an appropriation from the Legislature,
he said.
   The changes could be enforced against the 104 insurance
companies based in Minnesota and out-of-state companies applying to
do business here, Borman said. Out-of-state companies already doing
business in the state wouldn't be held to the new regulations, but
they may be targeted for review if they are not meeting revised
standards, Borman said.
   ``I am certain that poorly managed companies will feel pain
based on the recommendations of the task force,'' Borman said.
   He said the changes are proposed as a way to target
``high-flying'' insurance companies who invested heavily in the
1980s in junk bonds and commercial real estate. Such early
government intervention could avert the kind of trouble suffered in
the savings and loan industry, Borman said.
   ``We're dealing with this in a forward-looking way,'' Borman
said. ``What you had in the savings and loan industry was after the
fact. They really reacted under a crisis mentality.''
   More than 30 percent of junk bonds issued in the 1980s were
purchased by U.S. life insurance companies, many of whom also are
long-term lenders in commercial real estate, Borman said.
   The proposed changes should not lead to higher premiums, said
task force member Robert P. Gandrud, president and chief executive
officer of Lutheran Brotherhood, a Minneapolis-based life and
health insurance company.
   ``We either pay now in improved regulation or we can pay later.
We see it as an investment in insolvency prevention,'' Gandrud
said.
   Borman said the state has the authority to suspend insurance
licenses and halt sales of a company until problems are cleared up.
   He said he did not know how many companies in the state would
have to sell junk bonds or make other changes in capital structure
to conform with proposed changes.
   Susan Mead, a spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based Northwestern
National Life, said the law should put Minnesota-based insurers at
a competitive advantage.
   ``The consumers can feel that if they have policies from a
Minnesota company they are pretty safe,'' she said.
   Borman said he may immediately adopt some of the regulatory
guidelines proposed by the task force. But he said there would be a
public hearing on the limits regarding junk bonds because it would
require legislative action.
   The task force was made up of four commerce department officials
and top executives from 10 Minnesota-based insurance companies.

   A widely followed index of construction activity
remained stagnant in September, another piece of evidence that the
broader economy is heading into a recession, the company that
compiles the index said Monday.
   The Dodge Index of construction contracting stood at 147 in
September, basically unchanged from the 1990 low of 146 reached in
August. By contrast, at this time last year, contracting for new
construction was at an all-time peak, 25 percent stronger than the
latest rate.
   The Dodge Index is a seasonally adjusted indicator of future
construction activity, published by the F.W. Dodge Division of
McGraw-Hill, the nation's leading source of construction
information. The index uses 1982 as its 100 base and represents the
value of all newly started construction.
   George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W.
Dodge, said the index shows ``the construction sector, which has
often served as a leading indicator of general business activity,
seems to be supporting the growing belief that the economy is
heading into recession, or may already be there.''
   The trend shows starts of new construction projects have fallen
for four consecutive quarters, leaving most parts of the country
far behind last year's pace, he said.
   ``As work in progress is brought to completion, spending and
employment in this key industry is drying up,'' Christie said.
   The value of new nonresidential building contracts totaled $83.6
billion in September, up 8 percent from $77.5 billion in August.
Residential building contracts totaled $104.7 billion, up 1 percent
from a month earlier, and the value of nonbuilding construction,
such as public works projects, fell 10 percent from a month earlier
to $43.2 billion, F.W. Dodge said.

<HEAD>Boeing Posts Record 3rd-Quarter Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co.'s third-quarter profits rose 56.2
percent on strong sales and high margins for commercial aircraft,
the aerospace company said Monday.
   Boeing posted profits of $378 million, or $1.10 a share, on
record sales of $7.176 billion. In the same period last year, the
company had profits of $242 million, or 70 cents a share, on sales
of $6.356.
   Boeing said it was still losing a substantial amount of money on
its defense and space work but the losses are projected to be less
than 1989's loss of $474 million.
   Two weeks ago,United Airlines placed the first 34 firm orders
for the all-new widebody 777 jetliner. It took options for another
34. It also ordered 30 747-400 jumbo jets and took options for a
like number. If all 128 planes are delivered, the deal would be
worth more than $22 billion, the largest commercial jet buy in
history.
   Despite the nod from one of its longest and best customers,
Boeing's board of directors had to give its formal approval to
build the new twinjet. It did so Monday, even as busloads of
employees were being brought to an enormous hanger at Boeing's
Flight Center for the ``all-team meeting'' of Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group's New Airplane Division.
   The meeting was more of a pep rally with marching bands,
cheerleaders and cowbells.
   Frank Shrontz, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer, was
greeted with a standing ovation when he announced the board's
decision.
   ``We clearly have the right product at the right time. What's
important is to develop it in the right way,'' Shrontz said.
   Boeing officials refuse to say how much they are spending on the
777, but industry analysts have estimated anywhere from $2 billion
to $5 billion.
   Shrontz said Boeing eventually plans to have 8,000 to 10,000
people working on the jet. But he said overall company employment
of about 102,000 in the Seattle area may not increase because of
cutbacks on defense programs. This year alone, Shrontz said, Boeing
has transferred about 2,200 workers from its defense segments to
commercial aircraft.
   Shrontz said 1990 sales are projected to be about $27.5 billion,
compared with $20.6 billion in 1989.
   Boeing has had problems on several defense programs, including
the second-generation short range attack missile, the avionics for
the Navy's new P-3 patrol plane, and Saudi Arabia's Peace Shield
air defense program. Shrontz said progress has been made in
resolving cost and schedule problems on government programs and the
recent reorganization of Boeing's defense and space segments should
improve results in the future.
   Boeing had a total firm order backlog of $86.3 billion on Sept.
30, compared with $80.6 billion a year before.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Boeing had net earnings of
$1.07 billion or $3.09 a share on sales of $20.58 billion, up from
earnings of $598 million or $1.73 a share on sales of $15.429
billion. Including a one-time restatement for income tax purposes,
the 1989 net earnings would be $896 million or $2.59 a share.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said
Monday the nation's economy has expanded at a 1.5 percent annual
rate during the first nine months of the year.
   An aide said later that Brady did not have advance knowledge of
third-quarter growth figures, which will be released Tuesday by the
Commerce Department, and was merely making a general point that the
economy was still expanding.
   Brady said some parts of the economy are ``in bad shape.''
   ``We're in a period of slower growth,'' but not a recession, he
said in an appearance in Easton, Md. to Friends of Washington
College in nearby Chestertown.
   ``But fundamentally, our economy is strong,'' he said. ``And in
the first nine months of this year it grew 1.5 percent. ... That
means very simply that the gross national product of the United
States was 1.5 percent greater in 1990 than it was in 1989.''
   A tape recording of his remarks was made available here.
   The GNP expanded at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the first
quarter and initial estimates of second quarter growth were 1.2
percent which amounted to a 1.5 percent rate for the first six
months. The Commerce Department later revised second-quarter growth
to just a 0.4 percent rate for a six-month annual rate of 1.0
percent.
   Assistant Secretary Roger Bolton, asked about Brady's remarks,
said the secretary meant that the economy had been growing at a 1.5
percent rate and was not in a recession.
   Brady was not available for comment.

<HEAD>Pennzoil's Third Quarter Earnings Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennzoil Co.'s 1990 third quarter earnings
dropped 25 percent, partly because higher crude oil prices cut into
refining revenue, the oil company said Monday.
   Third quarter net income this year totaled $26.4 million, or 66
cents per share, compared to $35.4 million, or 87 cents per share
posted a year ago, Pennzoil said.
   The earnings decline came despite a 13.5 percent increase in
third quarter revenues, which were $615.4 million compared to
$542.3 million for the same period last year.
   James L. Pate, Pennzoil president and chief executive, said
higher crude oil costs caused by the Persian Gulf crisis reduced
operating income for the company's refinery division.
   ``Pennzoil's motor oil sales in the third quarter were at an
all-time high, but we were unable to adjust product prices to fully
recover the surge in crude costs,'' he said.
   In the oil and gas segment, improved oil revenues were offset by
reduced gas revenues reflecting lower prices and sales volumes,
Pennzoil said.
   ``In contrast to higher crude prices, natural gas prices and
demand were down in the third quarter. Since Pennzoil is a major
producer of natural gas, our earnings were negatively impacted by
this situation,'' Pate said.
   He said colder weather should improve gas prices and demand.
   For the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, Pennzoil's net income
was $63.8 million, or $1.62 per share.
   Net income for the same period in 1989 was $206 million, or
$5.36 per share. The year-to-date earnings include an after-tax
gain of $86.8 million on the sale of Burlington Resources Inc.
common stock.
   Revenues for the nine-month period were $1.7 billion this year
and $1.8 billion in 1989.
