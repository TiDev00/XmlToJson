   Texas GOP gubernatorial nominee Clayton Williams called Democrat
Ann Richards a ``liar'' to her face Thursday, and former Sen. John
Tower said Nebraska Democrat Jim Exon has a reputation as one of
the ``biggest boozers in the Senate.''
   Williams and Richards were making a rare joint appearance in
Dallas. Tower, who is from Texas, was in Omaha to campaign on
behalf of Exon's Republican opponent for the Senate seat, former
Rep. Hal Daub.
   With less than a month to go before the Nov. 6 elections,
rhetoric also heated up in gubernatorial races in Maine and
Michigan. A supporter of GOP candidate John Engler Michigan Gov.
James Blanchard's tactics to Hitler's. Maine Democrat Joseph
Brennan deflected criticism of pardons he gave as governor, saying
Republican Gov. John McKernan might have needed one.
   Exon denied Tower's accusations and said he would welcome a
Senate investigation of his reputation. He urged Daub to renounce
the allegations. At a news conference, Daub declined to do so.
   Nebraska's other senator, Democrat Bob Kerrey, called Tower's
campaign activities ``wormlike.''
   Tower left the Senate after the 1984 elections. Last year
President Bush nominated him to be secretary of defense, but those
aspirations were derailed by allegations of drinking and
womanizing. Exon had opposed Tower's nomination.
   ``Sen. Exon bore down on me heavily on the drinking thing when
he's got the reputation in Washington of being one of the two or
three biggest boozers in the Senate,'' Tower said on Omaha radio
station KKAR's program ``Talk of the Town.''
   ``We're talking about reputation,'' Tower continued. ``We're
talking about rumor. Specific comments that have been related to me
by others. So I would have to say that I don't have firsthand
knowledge. I would establish that because that is the fair way to
do it.''
   In Dallas, Richards and Williams were on a podium at a gathering
of the Greater Dallas Crime Commission when Williams walked to
Richards' side of the stage to greet supporters.
   Richards extended her hand, but Williams declined to shake it,
saying, ``I'm here to call you a liar today.''
   ``That's what you are. You've lied about me; you've lied about
Mark White and you've lied about Jim Mattox. I'm going to finish
this deal today.''
   Richards defeated White and Mattox in a bitter Democratic
primary. Williams' campaign has been punctuated by outspoken and
sometimes outrageous remarks.
   Williams said he was angry that Richards was spreading rumors in
an attempt to link him with a federal investigation into alleged
drug money laundering.
   ``We think she stepped over the line. It is our intention that
Ann Richards is no longer able to spread her venom. We want to make
sure she is not able to destroy other people's careers and
reputations,'' said campaign spoksman Bill Kenyon.
   Richards called Williams' comment ``unkind'' and said ``I think
it's important that Clayton Williams tell the people of Texas
exactly what kind of businessman he is.''
   In Michigan, a supporter of Republican gubernatorial candidate
John Engler on Tuesday said Gov. James Blanchard's tactics have
``been as effective as the Third Reich under Hitler.''
   Richard Headlee, the leader of a statewide effort to cut
property taxes, said Blanchard, a Democrat, misled voters to make
them believe he supports property tax relief much as Adolf Hitler
brainwashed the German people into supporting Nazism.
   Engler's campaign director backed away from the comment
Wednesday, calling Headlee ``a little zealous.''
   ``He was talking about the public relations machine. We don't
share Dick's view on that,'' said Dan Pero, Engler's campaign
director. ``Dick gets somewhat carried away and he used a poor
analogy.''
   In Maine's gubernatorial race, Rep. Joseph Brennan, a Democrat,
called Republican Gov. John McKernan a hypocrite Tuesday for
criticizing his record on pardons as governor.
   ``If John McKernan hadn't been lucky, if the police had knocked
on the door one night and arrested him for possession of illegal
drugs, he would have been in the exact same position of many of
those I pardoned,'' said Brennan, who was governor from 1978-86.
   McKernan has admitted smoking marijuana in college; Brennan has
said he never tried it.
   McKernan has accused Brennan of pardoning political friends.

<HEAD>Massacres Said to Occur in Rwanda Tribal Fighting</HEAD>

   Soldiers massacred hundreds of Rwandan
civilians belonging to the same tribe as the rebels who have
invaded the central African nation, according to refugees who
reached Uganda.
   But Rwanda's president denied the claim, and a diplomat familiar
with the area said Thursday he doubted the reports were true.
   Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana told a news conference
Wednesday that fourteen civilians had been killed in fighting
between his troops and Rwandan exiles who invaded from Uganda on
Sept. 30.
   Habyarimana also said 3,000 people had been arrested since the
invasion. Many of the detainees belong to the minority Tutsi tribe.
An exiled Tutsi is leading the rebel force that invaded Rwanda last
month.
   The Hutus, who make up 85 percent of Rwanda's 8 million people,
wrested control of the country from the Tutsi in 1959.
   Habyarimana denied reports from Rwandan exiles that his soldiers
had indiscriminantly fired on civilians and killed more than 1,000
people in 10 villages on the border with Uganda.
   Some of the approximately 500 refugees who crossed into Uganaa
on Tuesday made the charges, according to the British Broadcasting
Corp.
   ``There was no way to escape because the soldiers cordoned off
each village before opening fire,'' a 45-year-old man from Chonio
village told the BBC.
   New Vision, a government-owned newspaper in the Ugandan capital
of Kampala, quoted a refugee identified as Stephen Kabarega as
saying soldiers were joined by civilians armed with knives, hoes
and spears in an attack on Tutsi herdsmen.
   The refugees said the soldiers accused them of feeding and
supporting Tutsi rebels.
   The Western diplomat in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, who spoke
on condition he not be identified further, said it did not appear
that government soldiers had reached the region of the alleged
massacre.
   ``I don't think the massacre happened. I don't think there are
any Tutsis or government soldiers in the area,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``It may be a rebel tactic.''
   But he said the rebel incursion could easily degenerate into a
tribal war.
   In 1963, the Hutu brutally put down a Tutsi uprising, killing
more than 10,000 Tutsis. About 250,000 fled north to Uganda.
   The invaders, who call themselve the Rwandese Patriotic Front,
spring from that refugee population. They accuse Habyarimana of
failing to allow the repatriation of more than 1 million Rwandan
refugees.
   The rebels are led by a former Ugandan army commander, Maj. Gen.
Fred Rwigyema, a Rwandan of Tutsi origin.
   Meanwhile, the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France,
endorsed intervention by French and Belgian troops in Rwanda but
urged the troops be used only to protect French and Belgian
citizens.
   Belgium has rejected Rwanda's appeals for military aid to fight
the invaders. A Belgian statement Thursday accused the government
of human rights violations.
   ``Belgium will put no troops and military equipment at the
disposal of Rwanda,'' Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said in
Brussels. The government will remain neutral in what it considers
an internal matter, he said.
   But Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said Belgian paratroopers
already in Rwanda to help in evacuations might move toward the
northeastern battle zone to protect other Belgians.

   A U.S. initiative in the Security Council
to condemn Israel for using deadly force against Palestinians ran
aground Thursday over PLO demands for a tougher resolution.
   The Security Council failed to reconcile the approach of the
United States and Britain with that of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and the non-aligned movement despite two days of
intensive U.S. lobbying and marathon negotiations Wednesday night
and Thursday morning.
   That put the United States at the risk of having to veto the
PLO-backed resolution against Israel, a move that would infuriate
the Arab nations President Bush has been trying so hard to
cultivate in the gulf crisis.
   ``We have a couple of issues still to be settled,'' U.S.
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering had said as tired representatives
ended their meetings at 4 a.m. Thursday.
   Sir David Hannay, the British U.N. ambassador and October
president of the Security Council, said on NBC radio after leaving
a meeting Thursday night with Pickering:
   ``I think if we fail to get an agreement tomorrow (Friday) that
would be very, very unsatisfactory. I think tomorrow is the time
when we must have to have a vote. . . . I think we've reached the
end of a long negotiatiing process. We ought to be ready to make a
decision tomorrow.''
   Thursday afternoon, President Bush telephoned French President
Francois Mitterand, whose government has said it is willing to vote
for the PLO-backed resolution condemning Israel, The New York Times
reported Friday. The Times, quoting administration officials, said
Bush told Mitterrand the alliance against Iraq would be hurt if the
United States had to veto the resolution.
   U.S. agreement to condemn Israel after Monday's killing of 19
Palestinian demonstrators by police in Jerusalem has been seen as a
major shift in public policy toward Israel. The U.S. government
commonly shields the Jewish state from condemnation by exercising
its veto in the council.
   But consultations collapsed as compromise efforts failed. No
formal meeting was held Thursday.
   More consultations were expected Friday, but it was not known if
a vote would take place.
   The Security Council has debated the killings since Monday. But
the 15 council members cannot agree on a common approach in a
resolution of ondemnation that would be adopted unanimously,
without a U.S. veto.
   The United States on Tuesday proposed that the council condemn
Israel for using excessive force against Palestinians who stoned
Jewish worshipers at the Western Wall, or Wailing Wall. America
itself drafted the resolution, which it described as ``balanced.''
   The U.S. decision to join the condemnation outraged Jewish
groups, which flooded the U.S. Mission to the United Nations with
phone calls.
   In contrast to a non-aligned draft, the U.S. resolution blamed
Palestinian troublemakers as well as Israeli security forces. It
regretted the attack on innocent worshipers and asked the U.N.
secretary-general to send personal emissaries to investigate.
   But PLO envoys said the U.S. proposal was so weak and tepid they
would be ``embarrassed'' to transmit it to their leadership in
Tunis as a reasonable working document. They objected to
apportioning blame and the reference to innocent Jewish worshpers,
and complained that the U.S. resolution made it appear the Israeli
police were merely incompetent and ill-trained.
   The PLO and others wanted the council itself involved in the
situation in the Occupied Territories, captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast War, and to send its own team to recommend how to
protect Palestinians from Israeli mistreatment.
   The United States was reported ready to veto a draft resolution
supported by the PLO and non-aligned nations as being too harsh,
ignoring Palestinian violence and opening the way to council
involvement and U.N. observers in the Occupied Territories.
   The council on Thursday worked on a British compromise draft.
   The five permanent council members - the United States, Britain,
China, France and the Soviet Union - want to preserve the cohesion
and unanimity that characterized most Security Council resolutions
against Iraq.
   But the Palestinian problem has proved intractible so far. U.S.
allies, the Soviet Union and China support elements in the U.S.
draft but also were ready to vote for the nonaligned resolution.
   Differences centered on a U.N. investigation of the violence,
whether it should emphasize protection of Palestinians and how much
weight its recommendations should carry.
   The PLO originally sought an independent investigative team
consisting of three Security Council members. Israel rejected that
as infringing on its sovereignty.
   The PLO compromised and accepted a British proposal for the
secretary-general to send his own emissaries to investigate. Israel
has indicated it could accept such a mission.
   But the PLO wants to make sure that the report makes clear
recommendations for protection of Palestinians, that it is made
directly to the Security Council and that the council takes action.

   Tropical storm Marco toppled trees and power lines as it swept
Florida's Gulf Coast on Thursday and heavy rain streaming northward
from the tropics washed out roads and dams in the Carolinas.
   The rain was blamed for at least five deaths in the Carolinas
and may have led to a train derailment.
   Nearly 10 inches of rain fell in 24 hours in parts of South
Carolina, with unofficial reports up to 11 inches, the National
Weather Service said. A hurricane watch was posted for the North
Carolina coast.
   Bermuda felt the effects of Hurricane Lili with rain,
thunderstorms and gusty wind.
   But while the Southeast bore the brunt of the stormy weather
Thursday, the entire East Coast also could suffer severe weather as
several weather systems may converge, forecasters said.
   ``There's not only Marco, but Hurricane Lili, a cold front ...
all converging on the East Coast in the next few days,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables.
   He said Lili was moving west and ``the question is how fast it's
going to recurve and approach the East Coast, possibly as early as
tomorrow night,'' Sheets said. ``All the weather conditions that
these are creating can produce heavy rain over the East Coast, and
that's of some concern.''
   Marco pelted Florida's central and southwest coast with wind up
to 65 mph and dumped up to 5 inches of rain before it began
weakening. It was downgraded to a tropical depression with 35 mph
winds by 6 p.m. EDT.
   Schools were closed in Manatee and Sarasota counties, where wind
gusts up to 80 mph toppled power lines, knocking out electricity to
50,000 people.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Marco's center hit land near Cross City,
which is about 40 miles west of Gainesville. The center was near
latitude 29.6 north, longitude 83.2 west.
   It was moving north at 9 mph, but all tropical storm warnings
had been dropped.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Lili was centered about 620 miles southeast
of Cape Hatteras, N.C., at 29.7 latitude north, longitude 67.3
west. The storm, with winds of 75 mph, headed west at 23 mph and
was expected to slow slightly and turn to the northwest.
   A tropical storm warning for Bermuda was discontinued.
   Sheets said Lili possibly could hit land at the Outer Banks, off
North Carolina, this weekend, but he expected to have a better idea
by Friday.
   Forecasters expected Marco to continue its generally northward
path.
   ``It's weakening ... but now the big problem is the rain,'' said
Sheets.
   Rainfall amounts of 3 inches or more were expected across
portions of north Florida and south Georgia.
   The hurricane center posted a tornado watch for portions of
north Florida and southern Georgia through the evening.
   Local forecasters said a tornado touched down northeast of
Florida's Lake City, throwing people into a lake, upending mobile
homes and felling trees across railroad tracks, weather forecasters
said.
   Another ripped through a housing development about 200 yards
from a hospital near Crystal River, Fla., tearing a roof off a
mobile home, knocking down trees and power lines and closing the
southbound lanes of U.S. 19.
   The Carolinas had been drenched by the remnants of previous
tropical weather.
   Three people were found drowned and a 9-year-old boy was missing
in South Carolina after a dam failed late Wednesday, Kershaw County
Coroner Thomas Horton said. The four were riding in a car that
stalled in high water.
   Two North Carolina highway deaths were blamed on heavy rain.
   In South Carolina, the rain forced the evacuations of residents
in Orangeburg and Kershaw counties. Also, dams overflowed in
Kershaw County and two bridges were undermined in Kershaw and
Chesterfield counties, the weather service reported.
   Heavier 24-hour rainfall totals for South Carolina included 9.50
inches at Honey Hill and Schulerville, with 6.50 inches at Cross
and Bonneau, the weather service reported.
   Heavier totals in Georgia included 7.70 inches at Hinesville,
7.30 inches at Jesup and 6.60 inches at Statesboro.
   In North Carolina, a storm total of 5.70 inches of rain was
reported at Kannapolis, and Wednesday's total of 4.10 inches at
Charlotte was a record for the date, the weather service said.
   Fourteen cars of a CSX freight train jumped their tracks east of
Marshville, N.C., early Thursday. Thirteen cars and one engine
overturned, dumping 3,000 gallons of diesel fuel, officials said.
No injuries were reported.
   ``The crew seems to think the ground gave way as they were
passing over it,'' said Norman Going, a spokesman for CSX
Transportation, based in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Officials of the Southwest Florida Water Management District
officials said 3-5 inches of rain from Marco wasn't enough to end
Florida's drought.
   ``It helps, but not as much as people think because the rain
comes down hard and fast and tends to run off or sit on the
surface,'' said spokeswoman Andrea Spadafora.
   But the rain doused the biggest part of a 40-day-old fire in the
Okefenokee Swamp. Ignited by lightning, the fire has blackened more
than 20,000 of the swamp's 438,000 acres.
   Officials at the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge said peat
moss in the swamp is likely to continue smoldering until the swamp
floods again.
   Tropical storms become hurricanes if their maximum sustained
winds top 74 mph. With Marco, there have been 13 named storms this
season, which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30. Six of those storms
have been hurricanes.

   The women's rights organization Khalida
Massaoudi leads is the largest in this Moslem nation - 400 members
in a total population of 26 million.
   Ms. Massaoudi, 32, worries that the shift to democracy will do
nothing to end tyranny for Algerian women. Her fears deepen with
each political advance by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front, known as the FIS.
   ``The biggest danger for us is if the FIS take power,'' said the
soft-spoken teacher of high school mathematics. ``It will prolong
the totalitarianism Algeria has already known too long.''
   She said the Marxist revolutionaries who ruled Algeria
unchallenged for 28 years had given the fundamentalists a
ready-made framework for oppressing women under Islamic law.
   The National Liberation Front, or FLN, imposed one-party rule on
Algeria after winning independence from France in 1962. Many FLN
leaders were devout Moslems despite their Marxist phisosophy, and
wrote into the constitution that Algeria would be an Islamic
nation.
   Ms. Massaoudi said each member of her Independent Association
for the Triumph of Women's Rights is a heroine in a society ``that
has never made a gift to women.''
   ``For the crushing majority of women in this country, the only
world is the family,'' she said.
   Although barely 5 feet tall, Ms. Massaoudi stands out in her
working-class neighborhood. She holds a job, lives alone, leaves
her red hair uncovered and asks no man's permission to go out.
Algeria's work force of 8 million includes only 380,000 women.
   Most of the rights leader's female neighbors cover themselves
with long robes and scarves before leaving their houses, and nearly
always are accompanied by another woman or a male relative.
   Women served in the National Liberation Front during the
eight-year guerrilla war and Islamic tradition coexisted uneasily
with Western concepts of women's rights during the first generation
of independence.
   Women in Algiers and Oran wore skirts and trousers, but most
rural women concealed themselves behind veils.
   Divided as it was between devout Moslems from rural areas and
more secular leaders from the cities, the FLN sidestepped the issue
of women's rights.
   Then, in 1984, the National Assembly passed the Family Law in
response to pressure from Islamic fundamentalists. It was reformist
in theory, restricting polygamy, giving women a say in educating
their sons after age 10 and allowing women to initiate divorce
proceedings.
   In practice, according to Ms. Massaoudi, law codified
second-class status for women.
   One of its victims was a woman who would identify herself only
as Keltoum.
   Her husband declared them divorced in January and threw Keltoum,
31, and their five children out of the house.
   He didn't need a court ruling. Under Islamic tradition
guaranteed by the Family Law, Keltoum's husband divorced her simply
by telling her the marriage was over.
   Had Keltoum sought a divorce, she would have had to prove in
court that he had committed adultery or had not wanted children.
   ``I can't imagine saying such things before a judge,'' she said.
``No Algerian woman could.''
   An electoral code passed in 1986 allows husbands to cast their
wives' votes, which contributed to the sweeping municipal and
regional election victory by fundamentalists in June.
   ``That law was the final stab in the back by the FLN,'' Ms.
Massaoudi said. ``The FLN dug the grave for women and put them in
it.''
   The FLN has a women's wing, as do other parties, but they remain
under the control of male hierarchies.
   President Chadli Bendjedid has proposed reforming the election
law, but the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front accuses him of
bending the rules to help the FLN.
   With solid support among Algeria's swollen ranks of unemployed
young men, the fundamentalists have the strongest party as the
spring parliamentary elections approach.
   Most followers of the fundamentalist party favor separate
education for males and females.
   ``The woman is sacred,'' said Dilinjer Boualem, 55. ``We want
them to learn, to do medicine, as the (Islamic) law says. But
mixing, this we are against. It is forbidden for Moslem people.''
   On rights to work, they are more vague. An article in the
Salvation Front's newspapr said women should work ``when necessity
arises.''
   ``The woman who goes to work and preserves her honor, modesty
and purity, who honorably fulfills her task, then comes home as
clean as she left . . . should not, in our humble opinion, be
considered as having disobeyed the commandments of God,'' it said.
   One test of modesty is whether a woman wears the hijab, a scarf
covering the head and neck. Increasing numbers of women, even in
Algiers, are doing so because of religious conviction, social
pressure or reasons of fashion.
   Others refuse, even those who will not speak to a Western
journalist without permission from a male relative.
   Rhodia Belkacem, a 21-year-old secretary who binds her long
black hair with gold combs, said: ``I could never go out in a
hijab. Nobody's threatened me, but I'll never wear it, even if they
kill me.''

   City officials fear an auto parts store
might want to dismantle a prime example of the original McDonald's
restaurant chain and are pushing for monument status for the
classic ``Golden Arches.''
   ``This is our most renowned landmark,'' said Mayor Roy Paul. ``I
believe that it has historical significance and don't want to see
it destroyed.''
   The restaurant in question was franchised in 1953 by the
McDonald brothers themselves.
   City officials fear the Pep Boys auto parts chain, the
restaurant's landlord, will decline to renew the lease and tear
down this fast-food relic that many say brings back memories
sweeter than a strawberry shake.
   The restaurant, one of about a dozen franchised in the early
1950s by Dick and Mac (yes, Mac) McDonald, has two giant arches and
a 40-foot sign featuring Speedy the cook, Ronald's predecessor,
winking in neon.
   This city 10 miles southeast of Los Angeles has long had a soft
spot for the McDonald's. The restaurant was even exempted from a
sign ordinance.
   The City Council also is considering a new historic buildings
ordinance that would require Pep Boys to state their case at a
hearing if they want to evict Ronald and company. Action on the
ordinance was tabled during this week's council meeting. A new
debate date was not set.
   The save-the-McDonald's campaign is among the latest efforts in
Southern California to preserve its fabulous '50s architecture.
   Studio City residents last year fought to keep a car wash and
diner from becoming a mini-mall. But the effort came up short, and
the car wash with its distinct 55-foot tower shaped like three
boomerangs and the nearby diner are history.
   In Downey, the McDonald's has the support of not only the city,
but the giant Oak Brook, Ill.,-based McDonald's Corp., with 11,000
affiliate and franchise restaurants and $17.3 billion in 1989
sales.
   The McDonald's Corp., which recently bought the Downey store
from its independent operators, would like to spend $500,000 on a
renovation project that will improve the store's facilities but
keep its nostalgic look.
   But McDonald's doesn't want to lay out that kind of cash unless
Pep Boys agrees to a long-term lease, said William Marble, regional
vice president.
   ``We want to restart and bring it up to proud standards,'' said
Marble. ``But if I can't get a longer lease, I have to walk away.''
   Pep Boys, with 300 stores and $900 million in sales, won't say
what it will do with the lease for the restaurant, which sits near
a Pep Boys store. Company officials dismissed suggestions they only
want McDonald's out of their lives.
   ``We have no intention to knock that thing down, and in fact
right now are trying to negotiate a new lease,'' said Fred
Stampone, senior vice president of administration.
   City officials say they suspect Pep Boys just wants to keep its
options open.
   ``They don't want to have a situation where the city requires
that they keep a hamburger stand there,'' said assistant City
Manager Ken Farfsing. ``It's on a fairly busy corner, and they may
want the ability of getting someone who will pay a higher rent.''

   A sparrow-size creature of 135 million years ago
appears to be the oldest known bird that lived in trees and flew
with agility, a researcher says.
   The creature's feet showed that it lived in trees, while its
wing bones, breastbone and short clump of tail bones suggest an
ability for long-range agile flight, said Paul Sereno, who analyzed
a fossil specimen of the bird.
   The bird, not yet officially named, followed a primitive bird
called Archaeopteryx by about 10 million years.
   Archaeopteryx, which retained many dinosaur characteristics, was
basically a ground-dwelling bird that probably could climb trees,
jump and flap its wings to propel itself, Sereno said. But its
flight may have been rather short-range, he said.
   The new study provides ``a really exciting picture of a
transitional stage in the early stages of bird history,'' Sereno
said.
   The findings challenge assertions by some scientists that birds
essentially lived on the ground for 50 million to 100 million years
after Archaeopteryx, he said.
   That idea was questioned two years ago with the report of a
tree-dwelling bird from Spain that lived 125 million years ago, and
now the new report pushes tree-dwelling back 10 million years more,
Sereno said.
   Sereno, of the University of Chicago, was to present a
reconstruction of the fossil bird today at the annual meeting of
the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Lawrence, Kan.
   The specimen was found in 1987 in northeastern China. The
Beijing Natural History Museum, which owns the fossil, asked Sereno
for help in studying it.
   John Ostrom, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Yale
Peabody Museum of Nature History, said Sereno's interpretation of
the fossil appears reasonable.
   ``I would be a little bit hesitant to say that the specimen
demonstrates a tree-dwelling existence, but that's not outrageous.
It's reasonable on the basis of what he sees in the specimen,'' he
said.
   Ostrom said he has seen the reconstruction but not the specimen
itself. ``It was very definitely an advanced-level bird'' for that
period, showing that modern-day flying ability came about very
early in the history of birds, he said.
   Sereno said the bird, long extinct, retained some dinosaur
characteristics: movable fingers on the front edge of its wings, a
lack of fusion of many of its bones, and a club-shaped end of the
pubic bone that may have rested on the ground when the bird sat.
   Sereno said he suspects the bird had teeth, but none has been
firmly identified. Judging from its size, the bird probably ate
insects, probably catching them while it was flying, he said.
   It is not clear whether its appearance so soon after the more
primitive Archaeopteryx means that modern bird characteristics
evolved quickly, or that Archaeopteryx was hanging onto its more
primitive form while other birds, not yet discovered, evolved more
modern characteristics, Sereno said.

<HEAD>Politicians Lining Up Behind Drive to Limits Terms in Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elected officials trying to get in step with
discontented voters are joining the drive to limit politicians'
terms in office.
   At least five candidates for governor this year are backing term
limits in an effort to tap voter resentment of politicians.
   And President Bush, under pressure from his party to join the
boomlet, says he's not opposed to the idea and might sign up, too.
   ``I haven't decided exactly,'' Bush said this week. ``But I
think people want a change against the incumbents up there on the
(Capitol) Hill.''
   Voters in Oklahoma endorsed a ballot referendum last month
setting a 12-year limit on terms for state House and Senate
members, the first real victory in this anti-establishment drive.
   Polls and some primary election results suggest voters are angry
at politicians in general - even if they're content to re-elect
their own particular legislators and congressmen.
   Backing term limits is ``the most accessible device now
available to try to establish you're anti-establishment,'' said
Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, a liberal Washington think tank.
   ``That's why political candidates are jumping on the bandwagon
with it,'' Mann said. ``It's gotten a lot of attention. It seems to
be anti-legislature, anti-government, so it seems to be in tune
with public sentiment.''
   Similar referendums are on the ballot this year in Colorado and
in California. No doubt more are coming.
   Colorado's proposal would apply to members of Congress as well
as to state offices, although it's uncertain whether that would be
constitutional.
   Most of the incumbents or candidates backing the idea are
Republicans.
   That's no surprise, since they tend to be the legislative
outsiders, hoping to become insiders. Many of the proponents are
challenging entrenched Democratic incumbents.
   In fact, the drive has been pushed in large part by Eddie Mahe,
a Republican campaign consultant in Washington. The group Americans
to Limit Congressional Terms operates out of his office.
   The Republican Party platform has called for limits on terms
since 1984, though hardly anyone pays any attention to party
platforms.
   But the idea has some supporters among Democrats, too. In
Massachusetts, both nominees for governor have backed versions of
the idea.
   John Silber, who upset the party establishment to win the
Democratic nomination, wants to limit legislators to six years and
the governor to eight.
   Republican rival William Weld - trying to show he's an outsider
as well despite his Boston Brahmin upbringing - supports eight-year
limits for legislators.
   Among others backing term limits are California Sen. Pete
Wilson, the GOP nominee for governor; Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden, a
Republican who's in a tough re-election fight; and Florida Gov. Bob
Martinez, another Republican facing a stiff re-election challenge.
   Wilson's opponent, Democrat Dianne Feinstein, countered that
limits would change little. There's no limit on longevity for
lobbyists or bureaucrats, she said.
   The rush to embrace the idea leaves some open to charges of
hypocrisy, or at least opportunism.
   Wilson, critics note, has held political office of one sort or
another steadily since 1967, though no one office for more than 12
years.
   And depending on how it's implemented, such limits may or may
not have much effect. The Oklahoma version would allow a state
House member to serve 12 years in that chamber, then 12 more in the
Senate.
   Still, opponents say, limits would needlessly purge government
of experienced and capable politicians.
   Eight-year limits have been in effect for presidents since Harry
Truman, however, and many states apply limits to governors.
Legislators, who make the laws, haven't been inclined to set limits
on themselves.
   But the ballot initiative approach may change that.
   ``I have no doubt that it will spread like contagion now,'' said
Mann. ``It's likely to pass in both California and Colorado.''
   And other states will follow, he said.
   Comedian Jay Leno provided his commentary on NBC-TV's
``Tonight'' show, citing Vice President Dan Quayle's support for
it.
   ``He's been campaigning for shorter terms for politicians,''
Leno said. ``Boy, if there's anybody who can convince people that's
a good idea, it's Dan Quayle.''

   The Iraqi Embassy has ordered all Kuwaitis living in
Italy to register with the embassy and get Iraqi identity cards,
the Italian news agency ANSA reports.
   The agency said the Kuwaiti Embassy, which is loyal to the
exiled Kuwaiti monarchy, said that it ``rejected in every way''
Wednesday's Iraqi order.
   The embassy statement said the registration was part of a census
being conducted of Kuwaitis residing overseas, ANSA said, and
Kuwaiti officials said it was the first case they knew of in which
Iraq had sought to force Kuwaitis overseas to register as Iraqis.
   About 60 Kuwaitis live in Italy, including diplomats, a
spokesman for the Kuwaiti Embassy was quoted by ANSA as saying.
``None of them however would ever accept an Iraqi identity card,''
said the spokesman, who was not identified by name.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed the oil-rich nation
two weeks later.

<TEXT>
   Gianfranco Ferre and Karl Lagerfeld have
crossed the formidable French-Italian fashion frontier, keeping a
foot on each runway.
   The result is exhausting for the designers and a mixed bag of
the best and the not-so-great of both worlds for the consumer.
   Ferre creates his own label out of Milan and in Paris designs
ready-to-wear and couture for Christian Dior, one of the capital's
oldest and most respected fashion houses.
   Paris-based Lagerfeld covers a big chunk of French fashion,
designing for himself and for Chanel, Dior's traditional rival. In
Italy he is the creative genius behind Fendi's ready-to-wear
collections and its luxurious furs.
   Tuesday evening their shows were back-to-back on the Milan
runway, where the Italian spring-summer 1991 ready-to-wear
collections are being presented this week.
   Lagerfeld has few problems adapting French coquetry to the
sensible lines of tailored Italian fashion. Ferre, on the other
hand, seems to be struggling to reconcile the purity of his
sculpted fashion with the more daring Parisian look.
   Beautiful Ferre signature blouses in crisp organza with wide
collar and turned up French cuff find themselves paired with slick
patent leather hot pants. Well-tailored leather trousers are
toughened by combat belts and goggle glasses, reminiscent of the
more aggressive Parisian leather look.
   Big bows are a Ferre specialty, but this season he decorates
them with jewel encrusted floral bouquets. Taken seperately they
are lovely adornments, but together they are excessive.
   When Ferre stuck to his Milanese guns the collection was
stunning, as in the white and ivory striped pant suits, the white
crochet shift dresses, the chocolate brown leather perforated
pants, or the floor length gowns with cut out embroidery.
   True to the latest trend in Milanese fashion, Ferre presented a
series of colorful prints, which reached their fashion peak in rich
jewel encrusted evening jackets.
   The main reason why Lagerfeld finds it so easy to spice Italian
designs with French frivolity is that he is designing for the
inventive Roman Fendi sisters.
   For the spring-summer 1991, Lagerfeld prints zodiac signs on
T-shirts, catsuits and swim apparel.
   The central item of the collection is the blouse - loose and
often pleated at the back.
   True to the latest trends, the Fendi collection is full of
pretty dresses in linen and silk, more often than not in demure
navy blue, perfect for a Gigi revival.
   If Lagerfeld followed some directions of the Milanese pack, the
bathing line was all his and all French.
   Based on the corset in shiny stretch fabric, Lagerfeld paraded
30 versions down the runway all accessoried by thigh stockings and
high heels for those slow to get the Folies Bergere point.

<HEAD>Toddlers Have Mastered the Video Recorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The typical British toddler of the 90s reaches a
chubby hand to the video recorder to select a favorite program,
then regales mom with the foul language he's learned from it.
   Down in the nursery there's more interest in television than in
teddy bears these days, according to a survey on toddler lifestyles
for the woman's magazine Options.
   Fifty-two percent of British children under 5 record and watch
their favorite programs without any help from their parents,
according to the poll.
   Among 4-year-olds, 72 percent have unlocked the mysteries of
fast-forward, freeze-frame, rewind and pause, researchers found.
   Jokes about the youngest member of the family being the only one
who can use the VCR may have some basis in fact, it seems: a full
fifth of kids under 2 are capable of operating a video recorder.
   ``My two boys are 9 and 4, and they certainly know how to work
our two videos,'' Jacqueline Mace of Witney in Oxfordshire county
told researchers from Market and Opinions Research International,
which did the polling.
   ``My husband doesn't know how, but they do.''
   Ninety-seven percent of children under 5 watch television or
videotapes for at least a half hour a day, the survey said.
   Other toddler trends include a tendency to swear, the
researchers said. Forty-four percent percent of mothers reported
that their 2- to 4-year-olds use bad language.
   But some things haven't changed, the survey found.
   Twenty-five percent of British toddlers still won't go to bed
without their teddy, or ``a bear of some description,'' according
to the poll.
   The pollsters interviewed 634 mothers across Britain between
June 30 and July 10. No margin of error was given.

<HEAD>If Bush Can't Make Up His Mind, How Will Congress?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If President Bush can't make up his mind on
taxes, the 535 members of Congress - many of them up for
re-election this fall - may have an even harder time.
   After leading the charge for the past four months on a $500
billion, five-year deficit-reduction package, the White House left
the playing field Wednesday.
   ``Let Congress clear it up,'' Bush shrugged as he campaigned in
the South for Republican candidates.
   His comment, coming a day after his apparent flip-flop on
whether to seek a compromise containing higher tax rates for
affluent Americans, only sowed more confusion in an already
convoluted budget situation.
   Democratic leaders seized on the opportunity to portray the
president as indecisive. Progress on a budget agreement once again
appeared to be grinding to a halt because of the White House's
mixed signals.
   Should lawmakers heed Bush's statement - made at a White House
news conference Tuesday morning - that he would accept higher taxes
on the wealthiest Americans ``at some level'' in exchange for a
lower capital gains tax rate?
   Or should they believe Republicans, including Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., who say Bush later buckled under pressure from GOP senators
and withdrew his support for such a deal?
   Or should they believe Wednesday's claim by Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., suggesting Bush had not ruled out a tax
increase?
   Bush and his aides did little to clarify the matter - or to hint
where his spinning compass might point when it finally comes to a
rest.
   The president deflected questions with wisecracks.
   He was asked as he jogged during a break in St. Petersburg,
Fla., if he would care to clear up the confusion. ``Confusion?'' he
responded.
   Was he giving up on a lower capital gains tax?
   ``Read my hips,'' he said as he jogged by, pointing at his
buttocks.
   Bush's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, was equally cryptic.
   ``I want to bob and weave on this today because we want Congress
to come up with a package and we don't want to signal on any
particular position,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater also appeared to dispute Packwood's characterization
that Bush agreed Tuesday to drop the issue of higher taxes on the
wealthy and a cut in capital gains rates. He said the president
listened but did not voice an opinion.
   However, accounts by other administration officials tended to
back up Packwood's description of the meeting.
   And a senior administration official aboard Air Force One with
the president Wednesday night said Bush still is ``open'' on the
tax issue, despite suggestions to the contrary. The president just
doesn't want to go any further out on a limb and invite more pot
shots from Democrats, the official said.
   ``He took water by saying revenues (higher taxes). He had a
package and he lost. Now he figures it's up to Congress,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Why should he
show his behind before others?''
   Bush dropped his 1988 ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge early in
the search for a budget compromise - a move that deeply divided
Republicans in Congress.
   Over the past months, that statement came to be interpreted as
meaning that Bush would consider certain kinds of new taxes, like
excise taxes, but not higher income tax rates.
   The budget package put together by the White House and
congressional leaders - and rejected last week by the House - did
propose higher taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol and certain
luxury items, but not on income.
   Thus, when Bush declared Tuesday that he might consider raising
the tax bracket for the wealthiest Americans - now 28 percent - it
sent new shudders through the already-battered GOP minorities in
the House and the Senate.
   It also raised red flags with conservative White House staffers,
including chief of staff John Sununu, sources said.
   Increasing the tax rate on the wealthy to 33 percent - as
proposed by some Democratic leaders - would represent a significant
boost. It could far overshadow the benefit from the capital gains
tax cut that would be the other part of such a deal.
   Thus, Bush likely would be giving up more than he got in
agreeing to such a swap - a point sources said was driven home to
him at Tuesday's meeting.

   White House chief of staff John Sununu's
reputation as ``big, bad John'' on Capitol Hill comes as no
surprise to former associates in New Hampshire who say his
persistence as governor sometimes turned into belligerence.
   But even some bruised in the legislative give-and-take during
his six years as the state's chief executive admire his ability to
get things done.
   ``They're so used to being treated with such deference in
Washington,'' House Democratic Leader Mary Chambers said Wednesday.
``They go home and everybody bows and scrapes and wants to shake
their hand. They get pretty arrogant and self-satisfied.
   ``Someone like John Sununu comes along and doesn't care who they
are. The mission of getting the job done, that's his driving thing.
It amuses me to read what they say about him.''
   Sununu bullied some, yelled at others. He tried logic, humor.
Some recall telephone calls every 15 minutes with additional points
he wanted to make to win their support.
   ``If I had to use one word to describe his tactics, it would be
`effective,' '' said Senate Republican Leader Edward Dupont. ``He
was capable of doing whatever he needed to get the job done.''
   Dupont said no one who ever worked with Sununu would ``see him
as a kind and gentle man,'' but neither could they call him
mean-spirited.
   ``I can't classify him as a bully because whenever he pushed, it
wasn't for the satisfaction of bullying someone, but to get
something done,'' Dupont said.
   Chambers differed often with Sununu over issues, particularly
Sununu's steadfast support for licensing of the Seabrook nuclear
plant. But she said he has the ability to ``get in and stir things
up'' to end legislative deadlocks.
   Joan Dolloff, president of the State Employees Association, also
butted heads with Sununu, who was George Bush's campaign manager in
1988.
   ``When that man took over, all I heard was about his arrogance,
but I and my issues were treated with respect,'' she said.
   ``Half of those postures he makes as a stand. If someone had the
fortitude to come back at him, he'd sit down with them,'' she said.
``If people can be turned away by what they perceive as John
Sununu's arrogant attitude, they have no business playing the
game.''
   Dolloff recalls an angry phone call from Sununu during George
Bush's campaign when the union's executive director accused Sununu
of grandstanding over a child-care program.
   ``I said, `Yes, he did say that and I concur with him,' ''
Dolloff said. ``There was a flurry of negative language. I held the
phone out. He said, `Consider yourself out of the loop.' Well, I
didn't know I was in the loop.''
   Sununu continued to return her calls as if the conversation had
never taken place, she said.
   Former state GOP chairwoman Donna Sytek, a state representative
from Sununu's hometown of Salem, clashed with him over party
policy.
   Sununu told her he didn't think an elected official should be
party head, then backed another state representative for the post.
``I knew I could win, but it would be a hollow victory, so I didn't
run,'' she said.
   Yet, Sytek said she'd support him for governor again in an
instant. ``Our philosophies are so compatible,'' she said.
   Legislators and associates who worked with Sununu developed a
respect for his hands-on knowledge of government, particularly the
state budget.
   ``He always took everything from the minute detail and worked up
from that,'' Dupont said. That lent credibility to solutions he
proposed, he said.
   Sytek said there's no question Sununu ``bullied to get through
his program, a program very thought-out and driven by ideology.''
   But she said, ``It wasn't so much to build up power for himself
or the office, but to make government function.''
   He also was charming. At a dinner not long before he went to
Washington, he left the stage to greet Chambers in the audience.
Chambers asked if she'd get into see him if she came to Washington.
   ``He said, `The minute you arrive I'll be sure the tall, skinny
man gets out of my office and see you,' '' Chambers said. ``I said,
`John, you've got it backwards.' ''

<HEAD>Study: Stressful Jobs Not Hazardous to Pregnant Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite their 70-hour work weeks, late nights and
grinding stress, doctors who become pregnant during residency
training face a low risk of giving birth prematurely, a study today
shows.
   The study casts doubt on the widely held belief that women who
work in demanding, stressful jobs are more likely to deliver too
early.
   The researchers based their conclusions on a sample of young
doctors in training at hospitals across the United States. They
noted that it would be hard to find a group of women who worked
longer hours, got by on less sleep or were under more stress.
   They surveyed 4,412 women doctors and compared their pregnancies
to those among 4,236 wives of male residents. They found that 989
of the women doctors gave birth to a single child during residency;
1,238 of the residents' wives gave birth to a single child.
   Although the women residents worked about twice as many hours as
the wives, about 6 percent of both groups delivered prematurely, an
unusually low rate. The risk of having especially small babies was
also about the same for both groups.
   Only when women worked more than 100 hours a week did they seem
to raise their risk of premature delivery.
   The work, by Dr. Mark A. Klebanoff of the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development, was published in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Earlier research has found that pregnant women who work nights,
put in long hours or stand a lot are more likely to have premature
deliveries. The latest report suggests that these difficult
pregnancies result because such women are often poor, not because
of their work.
   During the first three months of pregnancy, the doctors worked
an average of 74 hours a week, while the wives worked 38. By the
third trimester, the doctors were working 64 hours and the wives 35
hours.
   Half the residents worked until the day of delivery, compared
with one-quarter of the wives.
   ``These results call into question the association between
stressful occupations requiring long hours of physical activity and
the incidence of pre-term delivery,'' the researchers wrote.
   However, they said their research suggests that new rules in New
York state that limit medical residents to 80-hour work weeks are a
good idea.

   Congressional negotiators are edging closer to
agreement on a clean air bill with a compromise on auto emission
controls, an issue that stalled the talks for several weeks.
   The tentative accord reached Wednesday on emissions removed a
major obstacle to working out legislation that can be sent to the
White House before Congress adjourns later this month.
   ``It's a major breakthrough,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
head of the Senate negotiating team.
   The legislation, which represents the first tightening of air
pollution laws since 1977, also would impose new requirements on
utilities, factories and thousands of small businesses to reduce
urban smog, toxic chemical releases and pollution that causes acid
rain.
   The new requirements are expected to cost the economy from $21
billion to $25 billion a year when all the provisions take effect
toward the end of the decade, according to White House estimates.
   Members of the House and Senate negotiating teams said they
hoped to complete work on the section on toxic industrial pollution
within the next day or two and turn to the section on acid rain
this weekend. Congressional leaders have set a goal of completing
the bill by midnight Sunday.
   Baucus said he hoped the final wording of the completed
legislation might be approved Monday by the House and Senate
conferees, who have met since July 13 to combine clean air bills
passed by the two chambers.
   The motor vehicle compromise, reached after sometimes
around-the-clock staff negotiations, calls for 30 percent to 60
percent cuts in various smog-causing tailpipe emissions. It also
provides for a limited phase-in of alternative-fuel cars - mostly
for fleet use - and cleaner burning fuels in cities with the worst
smog problems.
   In some cases, the compromise was weaker than proposals passed
by either the House or Senate earlier this year because
implementation of many of the tougher standards were postponed by
several years. The White House argued for some of the delays,
claiming, for example, that a requirement for cleaner fuels could
lead to supply shortages almost immediately.
   In the compromise, the requirement for cleaner gasoline blends
in cities with the worst smog would not go into effect until 1995,
instead of next year. Some of the fleet provisions, requiring the
use of vehicles that run on a fuel other than gasoline, also would
be moved back from the mid-1990s to 1998.
   ``It's a very ambitious program, but a program that is not going
to have much of an impact until the late 1990s or early in the 21st
century,'' said Daniel Weiss, who has followed the clean air debate
for the Sierra Club, an environmental organization.
   A dispute over state enforcement of auto pollution requirements,
which had occupied the negotiations for more than a week, was
resolved by allowing states to enforce their own standards as long
as they aren't tougher than rules set by California or the federal
government.
   Senators from some states, including New York, had balked at an
earlier proposal they said would have kept states from enforcing
tougher auto emission controls such as the California standards.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who heads the House negotiators, had
insisted on a provision that would safeguard automakers from having
to meet myriad pollution requirements in various states.
   By resolving the motor vehicle section of the bill, the House
and Senate negotiators resolved ``the toughest obstacle to final
passage'' of the legislation, Baucus said late Wednesday. He said
he now was increasingly optimistic that a final bill could be
approved this session.
   Dingell was less enthusiastic, saying only that the conferees
``are well over halfway toward (the) goal'' of getting a bill
enacted this year.
   The conferees reached agreement earlier on three other sections
of the bill: new pollution controls on factories and businesses to
reduce urban smog; a phaseout of chemicals that cause a depletion
of the atmospheric ozone layer; and rules on timetables for cities
to meet federal air quality standards.

   Coffee drinkers, delight. A good cup of joe, or
two, or three, won't hurt the heart, Harvard researchers reported
today.
   In fact, coffee with caffeine, the often maligned chemical that
gives the brew its kick, may turn out to be easier on the heart
than the decaffeinated variety.
   ``It's amazing how coffee has a bad name, when the harder one
looks at health hazards, the more difficult it is to find adverse
effects,'' says Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public
Health.
   His research, part of a huge study of healthy people, shows that
those who drink several cups of ordinary caffeinated coffee every
day do not raise their risk of heart attacks.
   ``This is a very reassuring study for something that people
enjoy day in and day out,'' said Dr. Harvey Wolinsky of Mt. Sinai
Hospital in New York, an adviser to the National Coffee
Association.
   The research was based on a survey of the coffee-drinking habits
o 45,589 men. It was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Those who suspected coffee was bad for the heart usually assumed
caffeine was to blame. But the new research suggests just the
opposite: Those who drink more than four cups of decaf a day have
about a 60 percent higher risk of heart disease than do those who
never drink it.
   The researchers cautioned that the link between decaf and heart
trouble is statistically weak and it's too soon to conclude decaf
is harmful.
   ``There is no particular reason to switch from caffeinated to
decaffeinated coffee from the point of view of preventing heart
disease,'' he said.
   Another recent study also raised doubts about decaffeinated
coffee. Researchers at Stanford University found that people who
switch from regular coffee to decaf increased their levels of
low-density lipoprotein - the so-called bad cholesterol - an
average of 7 percent.
   No one knows why decaffeinated coffee might do this. Some
speculate it could result from differences in the type of beans
used to make decaf or in the way they are processed.
   Caffeine might trigger heart palpitations in some people, but
Dr. Peter Wilson of the Framingham Heart Study said there is no
good proof of this either.
   ``The Marcus Welby theories are reasonable, but there isn't a
lot of proof to back them up - that you should be drinking decaf
because it's better for your heart,'' Wilson said. Robert Young,
who played Dr. Welby in a TV series, made commercials for a brand
of decaffeinated coffee.
   Wilson added that if people believe they have fewer palpitations
by switching, ``it's very reasonable, and they shouldn't toss the
decaf down the sink.''
   While the wisdom of very high coffee consumption is
questionable, several experts agreed that three or four cups a day
of typical American coffee are safe for virtually everybody, even
those with heart disease.
   Participants in the Harvard study, all doctors, dentists and
other health professionals, filled out questionnaires about their
coffee habits. After two years, 221 of them had suffered heart
attacks or died of heart disease, while 136 had undergone coronary
bypass surgery or angioplasty.
   The risk among those who drank four or more cups of all kinds of
coffee or just caffeinated coffee was about the same as for
non-users.
   ``This study means that if there is a hazard with drinking
caffeinated coffee, it's going to be very small, and there may be
none at all,'' said Willett.

   More than 33,000 military reservists have been
called to active duty in support of the U.S. buildup in the Persian
Gulf area - nearly as many as were activated during crises in
Vietnam and Korea in 1968.
   The Army today activated 12 National Guard and 24 Army Reserve
units from 24 states and Puerto Rico, for a total of 4,846 troops.
Meanwhile, the Marine Corps said Wednesday it was calling up about
160 reservists.
   Those actions brought to 33,252 the number of reservists from
all services activated since Aug. 22 when President Bush authorized
their use in support of Operation Desert Shield.
   None of the reserves called so far are from combat units; all
are performing combat support or combat service functions such as
cargo handling, air, sea and ground transportation, water
purification, intelligence and security.
   The 160 Marine reservists are the first from that service branch
to get the call in the current crisis.
   The Pentagon said in late August that it expected to call up
nearly 50,000 reserves by Oct. 1, but officials recently said the
immediate need had been overestimated.
   Still, the total ordered to active duty so far is approaching
the 35,280 called up in 1968 following the Tet offensive in Vietnam
and the seizure by North Korea of the U.S. surveillance ship
Pueblo. Those were the most recent uses of military reserves, other
than a brief callup during the 1970 postal workers' strike.
   The Marine reservists called up Wednesday are forming a combat
service support detachment to replace active duty Marines at
Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, who already have been sent to the gulf area.
   The Army reserves being placed on active duty today are mainly
from transportation, maintenance and combat engineering units. Here
are the Army units, by state:
   -Arizona: 348th Transportation Co. of the Army Reserve at
Phoenix.
   -Arkansas: 299th Engineer Co. of the Army Reserve at Pine Bluff.
   -Florida: 743rd Combat Support Co. of the National Guard at Fort
Lauderdale; 325th Combat Support Co. of the National Guard at Lake
Wales; 138th Aerial Surveillance Co. of the Army Reserve at
Orlando, and the 873rd Quartermaster Detachment of the Army Reserve
at Miami.
   -Georgia: 165th Quartermaster Co. of the National Guard at
Savannah.
   -Illinois: 419th Transportation Headquarters Detachment of the
Army Reserve at Peoria.
   -Kansas: 842nd Quartermaster Co. of the Army Reserve at Olathe.
   -Kentucky: 2123rd Transportation Co. of the National Guard at
Bowling Green.
   -Louisiana: 1086th Transportation Co. of the National Guard at

<HEAD>Prospects of Referendum Bill Passing Seem Dim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chances seem dim that legislation authorizing
a referendum on the status of Puerto Rico will pass Congress this
year, despite approval of the bill by the House and the support of
President Bush.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who is handling the Senate version
of the bill, said Wednesday that time has run out.
   ``With probably only 10 days remaining in this Congress and
absent a lame-duck session, it has become clear that enactment of a
Puerto Rico referendum bill is not possible,'' said Johnston.   ``There
are substantial differences between the House and Senate
approaches to this issue - differences which cannot be resolved
within the very limited amount of time remaining in this
Congress,'' he said.
   The House, by voice vote, approved a bill Wednesday that
authorizes $13.5 million for a referendum to determine whether
Puerto Rico should become a state, become independent or have
enhanced commonwealth status.
   In order for the money to be spent, however, an appropriations
measure also would have to be approved.
   ``The bill has the potential to open up a path that in time will
bring to an indisputable end the United States' imputed
colonialistic rule of Puerto Rico,'' said Jaime Fuster, the
island's nonvoting resident commissioner in Congress.
   Delegate Ron de Lugo, D-V.I., who sponsored the bill, said it
would ``establish the necessary process at a time when
self-determination is spreading through the world.''
   Bush, in a letter to de Lugo, said: ``I would urge the entire
Congress to act affirmatively and rapidly on whatever responsible
measure comes before them to call for a referendum on Puerto Rico's
political status. I stand ready to sign such legislation when it
reaches my desk.''
   Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., who was born in Puerto Rico, said he
hoped Johnston could be persuaded to change his mind and move
forward during the remaining days of the session.
   ``I very much fear that to lose our momentum now could end
prospects of a Puerto Rican referendum for years,'' said Serrano.
   Johnston said he would meet with Puerto Rican leaders next month
to consider steps to be taken in the next session of Congress.
   ``If there is a determination to continue this effort, then I
expect to resume consideration of the Senate legislation where we
have left off, and complete Senate action early next year, which
would still allow for a referendum in 1991, or early 1992 - well
before the scheduled fall 1992 local elections,'' he said.
   The House bill calls for the referendum to be held Sept. 16,
1991, or later if agreed to by a majority of Puerto Rico's three
political parties. The three parties represent the three choices of
status that would be on the ballot.
   Once the referendum is held, Congress would be required to enact
further legislation to implement the decision of the referendum, to
be ratified by Puerto Ricans in a second round of balloting.
   Under the Senate bill, the referendum would automatically change
Puerto Rico's political status. It has been approved by two
committees, but still needs action by a third before going to the
full Senate for a vote.
   There was no dissent in the House during debate on the
referendum bill.
   Status has been an obsession in Puerto Rico since it was ruled
by Spain. After more than 400 years as a colony, the island won
autonomy and full representation in the Spanish parliament in 1897.
   The next year, it lost all self-determination when the United
States took possession through the Treaty of Paris. In 1917, Puerto
Ricans were made U.S. citizens.
   The island is a commonwealth of the United States, but that
status does not bestow upon Puerto Ricans all the privileges of
other Americans. For example, they do not get the same welfare
benefits as residents of the states and the District of Columbia.
They also do not have full voting representation in Congress.
Neither do they pay federal income tax.

   Congress is considering a boost in benefits
for the military reserves activated in the Persian Gulf buildup.
   ``I believe that all of our military personnel in the Persian
Gulf deserve a tangible expression of our support,'' said Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio.
   House and Senate versions of the 1991 defense bill would provide
an immediate housing allowance for reservists called to active duty
to support Operation Desert Shield - a total of 33,252 as of
Wednesday.
   Generally, once members of the National Guard or reserves are
called to active duty for more than 30 days, they receive the same
pay and benefits as their active duty counterparts. Salary is based
on the active duty pay scale for grade and length of service.
   All of the reservists called up by President Bush are on an
initial 90-day assignment.
   ``The dependents of such a reservist are also entitled to
medical care, commissary, exchange and other morale, welfare and
recreation benefits on the same basis as the dependents of any
other active duty member,'' said the Congressional Research Service
in a briefing paper.
   The two major exceptions to the benefits for reserves are dental
care and housing.
   Military personnel must serve at least two years of active duty
service for dependents to receive non-emergency dental care, and
the House and Senate bills do not change that policy.
   The Variable Housing Allowance, based on local housing costs and
paid to personnel who do not live in government housing, requires a
call to active duty of at least 140 days.
   In Senate legislation, reservists called to active duty would be
exempted from the 140-day requirement to qualify for the housing
allowance. The bill also would exempt reservists from limits on
payment of unused leave.
   Glenn and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, are seeking to add those benefits for
reservists called to active duty - along with income tax relief and
a savings program for all military personnel - to the defense bill
for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The House defense bill makes a similar change in the housing
allowance requirement. It also would allow reserve medical and
dental officers to receive the same pay as their active duty
counterparts.
   In both the House and Senate legislation, lawmakers called for
providing ``imminent danger pay'' of $110 a month to all service
personnel in the Persian Gulf region.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney already has acted on that matter,
though, approving the imminent danger pay on Sept. 20, retroactive
to Sept. 1.

<HEAD>NTSB Draws Up List of 18 `Most Wanted' Safety Improvements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety watchdogs, frustrated by alleged
bureaucratic foot-dragging, are calling for action on 18 ``most
wanted'' improvements in air, sea and land transportation.
   But Transportation Department officials say progress is being
made on many of the issues raised by the National Transportation
Safety Board and that some recommendations either have been
implemented or soon will be.
   The proposals by the NTSB, an independent federal agency, range
from development of an effective air collision-avoidance system to
adoption of state laws permitting police to confiscate licenses on
the spot from suspected drunken drivers.
   They address safety conditions on fishing vssels and giant
passenger liners, seek new systems to keep railroad trains from
colliding into each other, call for the identification of pilots
with drug and alcohol problems and seek to identify links between
fatigue and transportation accidents.
   Safety recommendations also are made for school buses, heavy
commercial trucks and passenger cars.
   Each of the 18 recommendations stemmed from the NTSB's
investigation of an actual accident, many of them involving
multiple deaths.
   The board's most-wanted list seeks to speed action by regulatory
agencies, industry and state and local governments.
   ``It's a call to action,'' said NTSB Chairman James L. Kolstad.
``Our most-wanted list of recommendations represents some of the
biggest areas for lifesaving.
   ``I think on some issues there has been foot-dragging,'' he
said, noting that federal rule-making procedures can delay
implementation for five years or more.
   The safety board has no actual enforcement power. It can only
identify possible safety improvements and recommend they be
implemented.
   Ed O'Hara, a Transportation Department spokesman, said that is
being done in many cases.
   On the screening of commercial pilots for drug and alcohol
abuse, O'Hara said: ``I believe we are doing essentially what this
recommendation is proposing.
   The Federal Aviation Administration adopted a new regulation in
July to identify and ground pilots involved in alcohol or
drug-related motor vehicle offenses that result in convictions or
administrative offenses, FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn noted.
   After Nov. 29, he said, pilots must notify the FAA within 60
days of such actions and face revocation of their medical
certificates, ``which you need to fly,'' if they fail to do so.
   Kolstad said he believes the highest-priority item on the list
is the recommendation for the passage of laws in all states to
permit police officers to seize licenses of drivers who fail or
refuse to take alcohol tests.
   ``That is the single most important way to get drunk drivers off
the road,'' he said.
   Air accidents can be reduced, the safety board said, by
requiring an airborne collision avoidance system - a recommendation
first made in 1969 - and by installing systems to avoid collisions
on the ground.
   The NTSB's other most-wanted safety improvements include:
   -Legislation to allow alcohol testing if an operator of a
recreational boat is suspected of being intoxicated.
   -A requirement that commuter aircraft to carry ground proximity
warning devices.
   -Sweeping improvements in fishing vessel safety, including
legislative authority to require the licensing of captains and the
installation of basic lifesaving gear.
   -Adjustable seat belts in new cars to make them suitable and
safe for children.
   -New standards to incorporate materials in new school buses that
will slow the spread of fire.
   -Improved fire safety standards on passenger vessels, including
automatic devices to close doors when smoke detectors are
activated.
   -Uniform regulations for drug and alcohol testing of all
transportation employees responsible for operations and safety.
   -Safety improvements in commercial trucking by detecting and
preventing drug and alcohol abuse, imposing medical standards and
dealing with driver fatigue.
   The safety board has made 8,200 accident-prevention
recommendations since it was founded in 1968. Kolstad said 81
percent have been adopted, but 1,800, including some of the most
troublesome safety issues before the board, have not.

   Nine former Kennedy administration officials
are disputing the government's refusal to release about 700
documents from the Cuban missile crisis.
   In papers filed in U.S. District Court, the ex-officials said
the government has failed to justify keeping information on the
1962 crisis secret. The withheld material includes memos written by
the nine officials themselves.
   They include Kennedy administration Under Secretary of State
George Ball, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon and Theodore
Sorensen, special counsel to the president. All three served on the
National Security Council's executive committee which dealt with
the crisis.
   Philip Brenner, a professor at American University, is suing the
State Department in an effort to get the documents on the
superpower confrontation.
   The Soviet installation of missiles in Cuba pushed the United
States and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. The
Soviets eventually agreed to remove the missiles.
   The State Department is invoking national security concerns in
refusing to release the documents. The agency provided
``insufficient information'' about many of the documents, Ball said
in a court affidavit.
   An affidavit by Sorensen noted that it is ``28 years after the
events in question'' and ``neither the principal figures or
principal issues of that crisis are still with us.''
   The State Department ``fails to provide sufficient information
regarding withheld documents and the reasons for their
nondisclosure,'' Sorensen added.
   Brenner's attorneys, the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring, got the
affidavits as part of Brenner's motion demanding a detailed State
Department explanation of the documents. The case is before U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson.
   The affidavits highlight the State Department's inconsistent and
improper over classification of documents, said the National
Security Archive, a nonprofit group that is doing legal work in the
case.
   The withheld material concerns communications between the United
States and the Soviet Union and cable and letter exchanges between
President Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
   It also relates to meetings of high-ranking Kennedy
administration officials and anticipated covert actions in Cuba and
communications from U.S. embassies. Thousands of other documents on
the crisis already have been released.
   Under the Freedom of Information Act, the government in most
cases must identify the documents it is withholding and detail the
reason.
   But the government has failed to do this, say the former Kennedy
administration officials.
   The State Department withheld one document which it described as
``analysis regarding Cuba.''
   There were many documents fitting that description ``which I
either authored or received during this time period,'' said Edwin
Martin, former assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs.
   It is impossible from the description to evaluate the decision
to withhold the document on national security grounds, Martin said
in an affidavit.
   The other Kennedy-era officials who filed affidavits in the case
were U. Alexis Johnson, deputy under secretary of state; Harlan
Cleveland, assistant secretary of state; Roger Hilsman, director of
the State Department's bureau of intelligence and research; Leonard
Meeker, assistant legal adviser; and Raymond Garthoff, adviser to
the bureau of politico-military affairs.
   The government also said some of the material is exempt from
public release because it relates to the deliberative process
within a federal agency.

<HEAD>Helen Hayes Takes Another Bow on 90th Birthday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 years after retiring from the
theater, Helen Hayes stood before an appreciative audience,
listened to the applause and took a bow. She was 90 years old.
   The veteran of years of Broadway and motion pictures danced the
night away at a black-tie gala party in her honor Wednesday night,
an event that raised money for the Helen Hayes Awards. For more
than 300 guests, the evening was a tribute to a grand old friend.
   ``I just hate to leave this event and go to, ah, heaven,'' Miss
Hayes told the audience of family members and friends.
   Miss Hayes was toasted by her son, actor James MacArthur, who
hugged her and said, ``I thank you, mom, I love you, mom - now and
forever.''
   Friends who joined in singing ``Happy Birthday'' included
actress Arlene Dahl, singer Nancy Sinatra, Sen. Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C., and the British ambassador to the United States, Sir Antony
Acland.
   The honorary chairwoman of the birthday party for the first lady
of American theater was another first lady, Barbara Bush.
   Reflecting on her 90 years, Miss Hayes said, ``Just think what
I've lived through since 1900. The first automobile ride, the first
telephone call, everything was exploding in wonder.''
   Asked about her phenomenal success in show business, she told
reporters, ``I think I was darn lucky. I just don't know how good I
was ... I don't have any system. I just drift along.''
   Miss Dahl, a longtime friend, said, ``She's a walking miracle of
wit and wisdom, talent and beauty.''
   Miss Hayes, born in an upstairs bedroom just blocks from the
Georgetown hotel that was the site of her 90th birthday party, made
her stage debut in Washington in 1906. Her first appearance on
Broadway came three years later, and in 1920 her name first went up
in lights in ``Bab,'' which had been written for her.
   She retired from the theater in 1971 with a Washington
performance of ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' but continued to
be active in motion pictures, television, radio and as an author.
She recently finished writing a murder mystery whose heroine is a
great lady of the stage.
   Miss Hayes was presented with a Helen Hayes Award of her own.
The awards are given annually by the Washington Theater Awards
Society for achievement in local theater production and
performance.
   It was the latest in a lifetime of honors for the actress, whose
film career began in 1931 with ``The Sin of Madelon Claudet,'' for
which she won an Academy Award. She won another Oscar in
``Airport'' in 1970.
   Her life in the theater is the subject of a film currently in
production for the PBS series, ``American Masters.''
   Asked about her greatest role, she cited the play, ``Victoria
Regina.'' She said it included a scene where a crowd said, ```go to
it, old girl. You've done well.' I like that. I'm going to have it
on my tombstone.''

<HEAD>Engler Distances Itself from Headlee's Hitler Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James Blanchard's tactics have ``been
as effective as the Third Reich under Hitler,'' says a supporter of
Republican gubernatorial candidate John Engler.
   Richard Headlee, the leader of a statewide property tax cut
effort, made the comment at a news conference, and Engler's
campaign later backed away from it.
   ``I think Dick got a little zealous with that,'' said Dan Pero,
Engler's campaign director. ``He was talking about the public
relations machine. We don't share Dick's view on that. Dick gets
somewhat carried away and he used a poor analogy.''
   Claims that Blanchard uses state resources to promote himself
have been a consistent theme of Engler's campaign. But Pero said
the alleged abuses do not compare to Hitler's tactics.
   Headlee, the 1982 GOP gubernatorial candidate, said he was not
comparing Blanchard with Hitler. He said he was accusing Democrat
Blanchard of dispensing misleading information to convince voters
he supports property tax relief as Hitler's machine brainwashed the
German people to support the Nazi programs.

<HEAD>Failed Candidate Complains Of Post-Election Lie From Winner's
Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Ohio congressman whose comeback hopes
were dashed in a rancorous Republican primary accused the winning
campaign of spreading a post-election lie about him.
   Thomas Kindness said Wednesday that congressional nominee John
Boehner was trying to ``drag me into this campaign,'' and demanded
in a letter to reporters that Boehner fire his campaign manager.
   ``Boehner's spokesman claims that I asked for Boehner's help in
paying off my primary campaign debt and was told to `get lost,'''
Kindness wrote. ``That never happened.''
   Boehner said he doesn't intend to fire his manager and hasn't
talked with Kindness but has received an indirect communication
about the Kindness campaign's lingering debt.
   ``A former Kindness campaign staffer called our pollster in
Washington and wanted to pass the message on to us as to whether we
would consider helping to retire his debt,'' Boehner said.
   Campaign manager Barry ackson ``made it clear that Tom had
never conceded (the race) ... and we just wouldn't consider it
unless he wanted to call himself,'' Boehner said.
   Kindness never called, and as of July 1 his primary campaign was
$19,000 in the red.

<HEAD>Feinstein Calls on Wilson To Name His Intended U.S. Senate
Successor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein is
demanding that opponent Pete Wilson name the person he would choose
to fill his U.S. Senate seat if he wins the governor's race.
   ``That successor is important,'' the Democrat Feinstein said at
a news conference. ``Will that successor be pro-life or pro-choice?
Will that successor be pro-Medicare or (for) more cuts in Medicare?
Will that successor be pro-Social Security or not?''
   The Republican Wilson has declined to name his preferred
successor or outline in detail his criteria for selection.
   A victorious Wilson would be allowed to pick his heir because
federal and state election law gives a state governor the power to
fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat, according to the California
Secretary of State's office.

<HEAD>Bill Clears Senate Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $15.3 billion foreign aid bill that would
forgive Egypt's military debt to the United States and sharply
restrict aid to El Salvador has cleared the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
   The action came Wednesday on a routine voice vote even though
President Bush has threatened to veto the measure because of its El
Salvador provisions.
   The measure is certain to spark a spirited fight when it goes
before the full Senate, perhaps as early as Friday.
   The measure is almost identical to one approved a week ago by
the panel's foreign aid subcommittee. The primary exception was the
addition of $306 million to the bill's economic aid accounts to
conform to Congress' budget agreement with the White House.
   Efforts are expected later to strike from the bill the
forgiveness of $6.7 billion in past military debts owed by Egypt.
Bush wants to erase the debt as a reward for Egypt's leadership in
marshaling Arab action against Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The committee avoided a fight over the El Salvador provisions,
delaying that battle for the full Senate. As it stands, the bill
would cut the country's $85 million in military aid in half.
   The administration wants the bill to restore all aid unless the
rebels agree to a cease-fire within 60 days, a move opponents say
would undercut talks going on at the United Nations.

   The Transportation Department has sent a draft

   White House spokesman Bob Marks confirmed the development
Wednesday night, but said he had no details on the standards.
   NBC News reported that changes in door manufacture called for in

   The current side impact standard requires that doors be made

<HEAD>Energy Department Selects Successful Bidders in Reserve Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it got no takers for
almost a fifth of the nearly 5 million barrels of crude oil offered
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The Energy Department said Wednesday it has selected 11
companies for the purchase of a little less than 4 million barrels
of oil from the reserve under the test drawdown order given by
President Bush last month.
   The department said the amount was short of what had been
expected to be sold because there were no bids for more than
800,000 barrels of high-sulfur ``sour'' crude that were offered.
The sour crude was one of six types of oil offered from the reserve
stocks in salt domes along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
   Buyers will take 1.35 million barrels of other kinds of sour
crude. Some refineries cannot process high-sulfur crude because it
corrodes their equipment.
   The lack of interest in the sour crude was attributed to an
expected increase in the amount of similar oil from Alaska's North
Slope at Gulf Coast ports next month.
   Successful bids ranged from $32.64 to $39.06 per barrel. The
department will be able to adjust those prices somewhat to reflect
changes in the oil market before delivery.

<HEAD>Old Servel Gas Refrigerators Recalled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old gas refrigerators sometimes used in
hunting cabins, vacation cottages and other remote areas are being
recalled because they have killed at least 14 people in the United
States by carbon monoxide poisoning in the past decade.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said it has arranged for
consumers to receive $100 in exchange for the Servel refrigerators,
which were manufactured between 1933 and 1957.
   The commission said gas burners in the refrigerators can be
fouled by dust, rust or other obstructions and produce deadly
carbon monoxide, especially if the refrigerator has not been used
for some time.
   In addition to their use in recreational cabins, the
refrigerators continue to be used in remote areas where there is no
electricity or where propane gas is a preferred energy source, the
commission said.
   In Ontario, Canada, about 60 fatalities associated with the
refrigerators have been reported in the past 20 years, it said.
   Owners of gas refrigerators may get information on the recall at
1-800-782-7431.

<HEAD>Senate OKs German Unification Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has overwhelmingly approved a
treaty formally ending the post-World War II division of Germany.
   ``We welcome the German people, as a whole, back to the
fraternity of civilized nations,'' said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   Voting Wednesday a week after unification, senators made clear
that nothing in the treaty's ratification should be construed as
tacit U.S. acceptance of the Soviet Union's postwar annexation of
the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
   The treaty, signed in Moscow Sept. 12 by Britain, France, the
Soviet Union, the United States and East and West Germany, now goes
to President Bush for his signature. It relinquishes all American
rights and responsibilities over Germany and lifts Soviet, French
and British controls over the country as well.
   ``A unified Germany is something I look at with some concern,''
said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., who fled Berlin during his
childhood. ``I intend to vote for this resolution. Nothin should
stand in its way. But a sense of the history of Central Europe and
a sense of the history of the world should be stated on the Senate
floor ... so that Germany will remember that we will be watchful.''
   ``The millennium has not yet come,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., echoing several senators' statements of concern about the
peaceful intentions of a unified Germany.
   ``We must now focus our attention and our energy on the
challenges of the future, not the legacy of the past,'' said Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the treaty ``does
not exact the price of German sovereignty for German unification.
... All freedom-loving people of the world have won.''
   The treaty was approved 98-0, with Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.,
and Pete Wilson, R-Calif., not voting.

<HEAD>Parliament Issues Racism in Europe Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A European Parliament report says
racism is on the rise in Europe, with tens of thousands of bias
attacks occurring annually in Britain alone and most Germans
believing immigrants exploit their charity.
   But the 518-member assembly only half-heartedly endorsed the
document on Wednesday, partly because of a recommendation to give
immigrants the right to vote in local elections after five years of
residency.
   After some intense political wrangling, the parliament agreed to
simply pass the report - which took a year to be completed by a
special committee of inquiry - on to the 12 European Community
governments without comment.
   The vote was 181-to-146 with 18 abstentions.
   The 176-page report offered a detailed summary of racist
incidents and the activities of right-wing political groups in
Europe in recent years.
   It said racism is worsening in Europe largely because of rising
immigration. But it also cites political changes in Eastern Europe
that have allowed many long-festering ethnic disputes to break out
into the open.
   Among those voting against the report were the parliament's 17
extreme right-wingers, who argued that it overstated racism.
Liberals and Christian Democrats also voted against.
   The report was written by a special panel of inquiry. It
followed a similar study in the mid-1980s which was found last year
to have shortcomings for ignoring the effect of the EC's single
market project on race relations.
   Among other things, the new report says:
   - One in three citizens of EC countries believe there are too
many people of other nationalities in their countries.
   - In the United Kingdom, a country plagued by an especially
``high level of racial harassment and violence,'' as many as 70,000
racial attacks occur annually. In recent years Britain's neo-nazi
``skinhead'' movement has spread to other European nations,
especially Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
   - Right-wing political parties with pronounced racist views have
won seats in national parliaments in France, Germany, the
Netherlands and Belgium.
   - Almost 70 percent of Germans believe immigrants unfairly
exploit their social welfare system.
   - France has been gripped recently by a growing number of
racially motivated killings, bombings and vandalism.
   - In Greece, Moslems are often harassed and denied building
permits and drivers' licences.
   In all, the report made 77 recommendations aimed at improving
conditions for the estimated 12 to 14 million immigrants in the
European Community and to encourage racial tolerance.
   ``Our aim should be that there be no second-class citizens
within the EC after the creation of the single market of 1992,''
said Glyn Ford, a British Socialist and the author of the report.
   Among the most far-reaching recommendations was one urging the
EC executive Commission to draft a `` European Residents' Charter''
that would allow non-EC nationals, legally resident in one EC
nation, the same freedom of movement within the 12-nation bloc as
EC citizens.
   The report also urged the European Commission to send more money
to poorer areas with high immigrant populations and to adopt a
common policy on refugee and visa issues.
   The European Community comprises Britain, France, The
Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Luxembourg,
Denmark, Ireland and Greece.

   A planeload of Americans and other foreigners held in Kuwait and
Iraq arrived in Britain Thursday on a flight to freedom in America.
Earlier, an Air Force jet crashed in Saudi Arabia, killing both
crewmen.
   About 320 people were on the Iraqi Airways Boeing 747, most of
them Americans left stranded in Kuwait by the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion.
   It was the first U.S.-chartered evacuation flight since Sept.
22. Diplomats in Basra, Iraq, had put the number leaving as about
400 - including about 350 Americans, 25 Britons and some Canadians
and Japanese.
   An airport official at London's Gatwick airport said the plane
left the Iraqi capital Baghdad around midnight and arrived Thursday
morning at Gatwick Airport outside London.
   Officials in North Carolina said the State Department told them
the Americans would fly into Raleigh-Durham International Airport
on Friday.
   The evacuees were taken by bus to Basra to begin the air journey
home.
   As in previous evacuation flights, arrangements called for
Westerners on board to be limited to women and children and to
Americans of Arab ancestry.
   The jet crash Wednesday was the fourth U.S. military air
accident since the United States began deploying forces in the
Persian Gulf region following Iraq's invasion. Two helicopters also
disappeared during a training flight. In all, 24 servicemen have
died and eight are missing.
   Meanwhile, the 10-week-old crisis brought more bad news for the
U.S. economy. Oil prices rose to a record $41.15 a barrel on the
New York Exchange before closing at $38.69, tumbling on an
erroneous rumor Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had been killed.
   On Tuesday, oil closed at $40.40.
   Traders said prices were pushed higher in part by the slayings
of 19 Palestinians in a clash with police in Jerusalem on Monday,
and by Saddam's threat to retaliate against Israel.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average
fell 37.62 points to 2,407.92, its lowest since May 1989.
   Saddam said Tuesday that Iraq had added another missile to its
arsenal that could be launched ``against the targets of evil when
the day of reckoning comes.''
   He made it clear he was referring to Israel and the U.S.-led
forces sent to Saudi Arabia after Kuwait was captured. About
170,000 U.S. forces are deployed in Saudi Arabia and on warships in
the gulf region.
   Saddam has repeatedly tried to link the status of Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied territories with Kuwait, indicating he
might withdraw from the emirate if Israel quits Arab lands seized
in 1967.
   In Washington, families of seven U.S. service personnel in the
crisis area; two congressmen - Reps. Jim Moody and Gerald Kleczka,
both Wisconsin Democrats -and religious leaders expressed their
concern at a news conference about the military deployment in Saudi
Arabia.
   The families wrote in an open letter to Bush, ``The Persian Gulf
crisis is not just a constitutional, a military or an economic
crisis. It is a family crisis. All across the country families are
facing the possible death of loved ones in a military offensive
they do not support.''
   They urged Bush to pledge no offensive action and to make the
U.S. forces part of a ``truly multinational and purely defensive
peacekeeping force'' under U.N. leadership.
   Alex Molnar of Milwaukee, father of a Marine in the gulf area,
said the families want a response from Bush and Congress.
   ``Isn't it time we got an answer? Our voices must be heard,'' he
said.
   The United States has so far taken no military action in the
gulf, but at least two dozen servicemen have died in training or
other accidents, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   On Wednesday, an F-111 fighter plane crashed in the southern
Arabian peninsula on a training mission, U.S. military spokesman
Lt. Cmdr. J.D. van Sickle said, adding that an investigation was
under way.
   The Air Force identified the victims as Capt. Fredrick A. Reid
of Harrisburg, Pa., the pilot, and Capt. Thomas R. Caldwell of
Columbus, Ohio, the weapons systems officer.
   The Navy said it found no survivors of the crash of two
helicopters over the northern Arabian Sea on Monday and was
suspending the search. An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet also
went down Monday, killing both crew members.
   In addition, 13 other Air Force personnel were killed Aug. 29 in
a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane in Germany. The C-5 was ferrying
supplies and equipment to the Saudi peninsula.
   The remaining military personnel died in ground accidents, and
one soldier died of self-inflicted wounds, the Pentagon said.
   Up to Thursday, freedom flights had transported about 1,900
Americans out of Iraq and Kuwait. Recent State Department estimates
indicated more than 600 Americans were stranded in Kuwait and more
than 300 in Iraq.
   American and other Western men are being held in Iraq and
Kuwait, many at strategic Iraqi installations to deter any attack
by multinational forces.
   In Washington, Kuwait's ambassador to the United States said
Iraqi soldiers in occupied Kuwait were torturing and summarily
executing Kuwaitis suspected of sympahizing with the emirate's
exiled leadership.
   Saud Nasir Al-Sabah also told a hearing of the House Human
Rights Caucus that Iraqi soldiers are looting food from Kuwaiti
homes and are barring citizens from hospitals, restricting medical
care to military personnel.

<DATELINE>ABOARD HMS TABUK IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saudi navy,
founded 20 years ago in a country more comfortable with sand than
the sea, is trying to recruit enough sailors to field larger ships,
officers say.
   The navy hopes to double its recruit from about 3,000 per year
so it can staff frigate-class warships as part of an ambitious
expansion campaign, they say.
   ``As we get bigger ships, we find it difficult to man some of
them fully,'' Cmdr. Faraj Al-Gathian, one of four squadron leaders
in the Eastern Fleet that patrols the Persian Gulf, said Wednesday.
   The navy has taken a number of steps to overcome the problem,
including heavy computerization on board ships to pare the number
of personnel needed, an advertising campaign that emphasizes the
navy as a career, pay incentives and special attention to family
needs while men are at sea.
   ``If you have a country with long shores, to have the shores
protected you need a powerful navy,'' said Capt. Ibrahim
Al-Maghlouth, commanding officer of this Corvette-class ship named
after one of the 7th century battles of Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
   The officers spoke while giving the Western press its first
extensive tour of Saudi naval facilities since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. Much of the tour was spent aboard the Tabuk,
watching exercises 70 miles off the coast.
   The larger ships in the Saudi navy, up to 10,000 tons, are
stationed at naval bases along the western Red Sea coast.
   In all, the Saudi navy has 7,200 men, including 1,200 marines.
It has eight frigates, 13 patrol and combat ships and four
minesweepers.
   Its air wing consists of 24 helicopters, most French-made
Dauphin II attack craft and Super Puma transports.
   ``The Saudi navy has the capability to defend the coast in this
region, we have good defensive equipment,'' said Capt. Ibrahim
Aqqad, flotilla commander and acting commander of the Abdul Aziz
Naval Base in Jubail, opened 11 years ago.
   The Saudi navy has not been involved in the interdiction and
boarding of ships heading to and from Iraq, but is monitoring
traffic, he said. Ships suspected of violating the U.N.-ordered
embargo on trade with Iraq have been stopped by Western warships
and boarded.
   The Saudi navy has never fired a shot in anger, even during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war in which dozens of ships were attacked. It is
one of the youngest of the navies in the gulf and faces the
daunting task of recruiting sailors in a largely Bedouin society
with no tradition of seafaring.
   ``People were not familiar with the sea, especially the desert
people,'' said Al-Gathian. ``They feared the sea. They thought it
was dangerous.''
   The 37-year-old officer had to fight family opposition when he
joined 17 years ago, an experience echoed by many crew members.
   The navy has tried to make it easier for families to accept
having their man at sea.
   Women cannot drive in Saudi Arabia, so the navy has set up
services on its bases so provisions are available without leaving
home. Buses shuttle children to schools through high school level
on base, and women can pick up the telephone and order groceries
delivered from stores.
   Frequent newspaper advertisements emphasize that the navy is a
career, an incentive in a country that cannot find jobs for all its
university graduates.
   ``Join the navy for a better future,'' is one current slogan.
Study in the United States for officers is another incentive.
   Navy salaries are five to 10 percent higher than those in other
forces, with new recruits starting at $1,000 per month and getting
automatic annual raises of about $100 a month during their years in
training, officers said.
   The navy is also trying to cut its manpower needs by stressing
computers.
   One computer links all the radar system tracking surface, air
and underwater threats to the Tabuk, for example.
   The computer operator can fire all the weapons systems from the
war room, including ship-to-ship Harpoon missiles, anti-aircraft
missiles, a rapid-fire machine gun and a 76-millimeter gun.
   The chief mechanic can watch all the engine room functions with
a computer.
   As a consequence, a ship like the Tabuk can be staffed with a
crew of 75 instead of the normal complement of 150, said
Al-Gathian.
   But the navy needs as many men as it can because it wants to
beef up its forces with more frigates as well as destroyers, he
said, a 10-year-old campaign made more critical by the Iraqi
invasion.
   ``This area has been in crisis for a long time and the navy is
trying to catch up with the other armed forces,'' Al-Gathian said.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer in a custody dispute over a
baby born to a surrogate mother suggested the woman never intended
to turn the boy over to his genetic parents because she coveted a
white child.
   Anna Johnson, the woman hired for $10,000 to bear the child,
denied the racial allegation Wednesday, testifying that she grew
attached to the baby as it developed in her womb.
   ``There's no way you can prevent your emotions from taking over,
and those instincts come out naturally,'' she said on the second
day of a Superior Court hearing to determine custody of the
3-week-old boy.
   Mark and Crispina Calvert, the couple who hired Ms. Johnson to
carry a test-tube embryo created from their egg and sperm, have
custody of the baby in the meantime.
   The hearing was to resume today.
   The case is the first in which a surrogate is seeking custody of
a genetically unrelated child. In the Baby M case in New Jersey,
the surrogate mother was also the genetic one.
   Christian Van Deusen, the Calverts' attorney, raised the issue
of race. Ms. Johnson, 29, has Indian, white and black ancestry;
Mark Calvert, 34, is white and his wife, 36, is Filipino.
   ``Have you ever told anyone that you always wanted to have a
white baby?'' Van Deusen asked Ms. Johnson, who firmly replied,
``No.''
   ``Have you ever discussed it with ... your former roommate?'' he
asked. Ms. Johnson again responded no.
   Van Deusen also questioned Ms. Johnson about her claims that the
Calverts were late in making installment payments of the $10,000 as
stipulated in the contract. He produced canceled checks, and Ms.
Johnson agreed that at least one payment was actually made early.
   Ms. Johnson, a single mother of a 3-year-old girl, testified she
changed her mind in June about giving up the baby after Mark
Calvert refused to give her a ride to the hospital during a medical
emergency.
   In a July 23 letter introduced as evidence, Ms. Johnson told the
Calverts to give her the final $5,000 installment or ``you can
forget about helping me out, calling it a breach of contract, and
not get the baby.''
   Harold LaFlamme, the child's court-appointed attorney, asked,
``Aren't you telling them in this letter ... if they don't cough up
the money, they won't get their baby?''
   Ms. Johnson denied that, saying she was anxious and confused at
the time because of money and housing worries. She had also just
learned of a welfare fraud investigation, which led to her
conviction on a misdemeanor charge.

   One candidate is a muscular 38-year-old lawyer
with movie-star looks, a law-and-order type who pumps iron at home
and talks tough on the road. His name seems to turn up everywhere.
   Unfortunately for Peter-Michael Diestel, it's often in nasty
slogans painted on subway tunnels and the wall around his handsome
house.
   The other candidate is a popular preacher, a laid-back liberal
considered the spiritual shepherd of the peaceful revolt that
toppled East Germany's Communists a year ago.
   Unfortunately for the Rev. Manfred Stolpe, he's not just facing
an unpopular politician, but a powerful political party led by the
chancellor of a united Germany, Helmut Kohl.
   Stolpe and Diestel are the main combatants for governor of
Brandenburg state, one of five states that East Germany became last
week when it acceded to West Germany.
   Kohl's Christian Democrats are favored in the other four states
in Sunday's balloting, Mecklenburg-Lower Pomerania, Saxony,
Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. The left-leaning Social Democrats,
Stolpe's party, are their main opposition.
   Of the 10 top candidates for governor, four are from what was
West Germany, another indication that people from the west are
poised to assume control of the east.
   East Germans endured four decades without a free election. On
Sunday, they'll be voting in their third in eight months, with
another one less than two months away.
   ``The people are fed up with elections,'' said Diestel, who was
interior minister in the East Germany government that ceased to
exist last week.
   Although a light turnout is predicted, electing governors and
state legislatures will help give the old nation a new regional
identity and greater political voice.
   The elections also will advance the process of forming a
federalist system to replace the centralized bureacracy left by the
East German Communists.
   The states will have to quickly assume regional responsibility
for schools, police services, transportation and social services.
   Simultaneous with the East German elections will be the race in
Bavaria, the largest of the 11 states on West German territory. The
winner will likely be the reigning Christian Social Union, an
arch-conservative sister party of the Christian Democrats.
   The Christian Democrats won East Germany's first free elections
in March, dominated the May local elections and are favorites to
win the Germany-wide national elections slated for Dec. 2.
   But if the Social Democrats can win anywhere Sunday, it is
Brandenburg, where they had their best showing in the March
balloting, finishing less than 4 percentage points behind their
rivals. Brandenburg surrounds but does not include Berlin.
   The Social Democrats, who advocate more government control of
the economy and broader social programs, are relying much on the
eastern territory's economic problems to boost their chances.
   Stolpe and Diestel have basically reflected the views of their
parties.
   Both have been running quiet campaigns, with Stolpe avoiding the
easy grabbag of Diestel controversies.
   ``We're both refraining from personal insults,'' Stolpe said
during a campaign stop Tuesday in the city of Kylritz, about 70
miles northwest of Berlin.
   ``We have a young democracy with many economic problems, and I'm
focusing on the differences between us and the conservative
party.''
   Diestel was chosen as interior minister by Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere in April and has been in hot water since.
   The complaint that has energized activists is the number of
former Communist ``Stasi'' secret police agents he kept on the
ministry payroll.
   So strong are the emotions that Diestel put up a security wall
around the home he recently bought outside Berlin, a lavish villa
that once belonged to the former Communist regime.
   He tore the wall down a few weeks later because it suddenly
became a new canvas for the graffiti artists who have adopted him
as their favorite target.
   Diestel, however, is a personable, popular figure among many
conservative East Germans. A dashing body-builder and former
lifeguard, he is considered something of a sex symbol.
   ``It's been reported that not only was I a Stasi member, but
also worked with the Israeli secret service and the Russian KGB,''
he said recently.
   ``Perhaps I'm also Mielke's illegitimate son,'' he added,
referring to Erich Mielke, the now-imprisoned former Stasi chief.
   Stolpe was head of the Evangelical Church in Berlin and for
years acted as mediator between dissidents and the hard-line
Communist government.
   Even though a new poll gave Stolpe an approval rating almost
twice as high as Diestel's, the race is considered virtually even.
   A Stolpe aide said the problem is not so much Diestel as Kohl,
whose party may be popular enough to overcome Diestel's
controversies.

   Defending champion Garry Kasparov goes into the
third game of the world chess championship with a 1-point lead over
Anatoly Karpov after defeating the challenger in the second game.
   Karpov resigned on his 44th move Wednesday night about five
hours after the game started.
   Kasparov now leads 1{ points to { point in the best-of-24-game
match. The third game is Friday.
   Kasparov, 27, who is the highest-rated player in the history of
chess, had the white pieces and the slight advantage of having the
first move Wednesday night against arch-rival Karpov.
   Kasparov, known for his bold, attacking style, and Karpov, 39,
who favors methodical, defense-minded strategies, opened their
long-awaited match Monday night. After five hours and 30 moves
apiece, their first game ended in a draw.
   Kasparov and Karpov last met for the championship in 1987. It
ended in a tie, allowing Kasparov to retain the title he had
snatched from Karpov in 1985.
   This year's tournament will feature 12 games in New York and 12
in Lyon, France. The winner will receive $1.7 million and the loser
$1.3 million.

   The California Supreme Court has refused to

million bail lowered.
   The court denied the request Wednesday.
   The 66-year-old developer blamed for the nation's biggest thrift

investors who bought junk bonds through his Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   Keating contends he is broke and can't adequately defend himself

   District Attorney Ira Reiner has acknowledged the $5 million
bail is unusually high but said Keating might otherwise flee

   Federal regulators took over Lincoln last year, a bailout

<TEXT>
   A leading West German counterintelligence
agent accused of spying for East Germany has turned himself in,
prompting the arrests of eight more people in an ever-widening
espionage scandal.
   Officials said Wednesday that the KGB had offered the agent,
Klaus Kuron, asylum in the Soviet Union at the last minute but that
Kuron declined.
   The 54-year-old Kuron, who surrendered over the weekend, is
believed to have supplied large amounts of information about West
Germany's spy-fighting efforts to East Germany over the past eight
years.
   He is reported to have been one of the most trusted officials at
the Constitutional Protection Office, West Germany's main
spy-fighting unit.
   On Wednesday night, the Federal Prosector's office said eight
other people had been arrested based on information handed over by
Kuron.
   The eight, who were not identified, are suspected of spying on
behalf of what was Communist East Germany until Oct. 3.
   Chief Federal Prosecutor Alexander von Stahl described the
Kuron's espionage activity as ``a very serious betrayal.''
   According von Stahl, Kuron agreed to spy for East Germany in
1982 and received a monthly fee of about $2,600. The Interior
Ministry said the suspect received about that much as his normal
monthly salary.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Willi Hausmann said Kuron was
offered entry into the Soviet Union by the KGB just before
surrending, but the Soviets ``offer did not appear lucrative to
him,'' so he turned himself in instead.
   Hausmann gave no further details.
   On Tuesday, justice officials announced the Sept. 30 arrest of a
47-year-old woman working for the German Intelligence Service,
which is also responsible for foreign intelligence work.
   The woman, identified as Gabriele G., is suspected of having
passed intelligence documents prepared for Kohl on to the East
German secret police.
   Justice officials have said they are worried that former East
German agents may now offer their services - and important
information - to the KGB.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein on Wednesday urged all
former East German agents - spies without a country - to turn
themselves in rather then seek refuge elsewhere.
   Dozens of East German agents have surrendered over the past few
months. More than 60 others have been arrested, but others are
still on the loose.

   An exiled Chinese poet was the focus of
the literary world today amid speculation the Swedish Academy would
award the Nobel Prize to a Chinese writer for the first time in its
89-year history.
   The academy was to make its final choice in a vote this morning
and make the announcement at the stroke of 1 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT).
   Bei Dao, whose somber short stories and poems have been praised
for their depiction of personal dramas entwined in the political
vicissitudes of Communist China, was said to be a strong candidates
for the $700,000 prize.
   Others said to be in the running were Gaelic novelist Seamus
Heaney, U.S. novelist Joyce Carol Oates, Mexican poet Octavio Paz,
Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado, West Indians V.S. Naipaul and Derek
Walcott, Turkey's Yasar Kemal, Margaret Atwood of Canada, South
African writer Nadine Gordimer and Japanese novelist Masuji Ibuse.
   The academy long has been criticized for ignoring China's
3,000-year-old literary tradition and giving short shrift to Asia
as a whole.
   There have only been two Asian winners in the history of the
prize, first given in 1901. Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore won the
Nobel in 1913 and Japanese writer Yasunaro Kawabata was chosen in
1968.
   Sweden, by comparison, has had six laureates.
   The addition of Chinese language professor Goran Malmqvist to
the 18-member academy in 1985 has put the board in a position to
assess original writings from the Chinese.
   Bei Dao was born in 1949, the year the Communists came to power
in China.
   He entered adulthood during the Cultural Revolution, which
lasted from 1966 to 1976, and Bei's interpreters say the feeling of
terror that pervades much of his poetry can be linked to the
violence of this period.
   Bei was a guiding voice for young Chinese writers during a
period of greater democracy in China from 1976-79.
   In February 1989, he helped organize a petition seeking the
release of political prisoners. He left China for a conference two
months later, just as the pro-democracy movement began in Beijing.
   Bei never returned and currently teaches Chinese at the
University of Aarhus in Denmark.
   Sources say Bei was a strong candidate for the prize last year.
But some writers have been rumored to be on the ``short list'' for
years.
   Female writers have rarely been awarded the prize.
German-Swedish poet Nelly Sachs, the last woman laureate, in 1966,
was only the sixth woman to win the prize.
   The prize was established in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel, the
Swedish philanthropist and inventor of dynamite.

   A suspect in the slayings of five college
students has been convicted of beating up his grandmother, despite
her testimony that her injuries came from a fall.
   Edward Lewis Humphrey, 19, was found guilty Wednesday of battery
on a person over 65. Under state guidelines, he could get nearly
two years in prison at sentencing Nov. 8.
   Humphrey has been identified by police as a prime suspect in the
August serial slayings of five students in Gainesville, including
four students at the University of Florida, where he was a
freshman.
   Humphey, who is being held on $1 million bail, is not charged in
the Gainesville killings. No arrests have been made in that case.
   Prosecutors said Humphrey pummeled 79-year-old Elna Hlavaty on
Aug. 30. Her face was bruised and one eye was swollen shut.
   The arresting officer testified that Mrs. Hlavaty identified her
grandson as her attacker. But Mrs. Hlavaty testified that she lost
her balance and fell on a fireplace while reaching for a light
switch.
   ``I am heartbroken that I have a crippled grandson that is being
railroaded in hell until they find the Gainesville murderer,'' she
said.
   Prosecutors said Humphrey pounded Mrs. Hlavaty like a boxer.
``He wasn't in a fight with Mike Tyson. He wasn't in a fight with
Muhammad Ali. ... He was beating his grandmother,'' said Assistant
State Attorney Philip Williams.
   Humphrey also faces unrelated charges of attempted rape and
assault.

<TEXT>
   There aren't many political parties
like the Illinois Solidarity Party.
   The gubernatorial candidate doesn't care if she wins. A
congressional candidate wants to switch every electrical system in
America to direct current. The candidate for University of Illinois
trustee is counting on big Election Day turnout among Indians.
   And the 4-year-old organization is fighting for its survival.
   Unless one of Solidarity's statewide candidates captures at
least 5 percent of the vote this year, the party no longer will be
considered an established party automatically entitled to a spot on
the ballot.
   The party's biggest vote-getter in 1988, trustee candidate
Martin Ortega, received 98,000 votes, less than 1 percent of the
ballots cast in an 11-person field.
   Illinois Solidarity, whose current leaders say they want to
create an alternative to the two traditional parties, was founded
by one of the most prominent members of the state's political
establishment, Democrat Adlai Stevenson III.
   When Stevenson won the Democratic nomination for governor in
1986, followers of extremist Lyndon LaRouche were nominated for
lieutenant governor and secretary of state. Stevenson refused to
have anything to do with them and resigned from the ticket.
   To keep his gubernatorial hopes alive, Stevenson collected
signatures, gathered running mates and created his own party,
Illinois Solidarity.
   ``The party was formed just for that purpose, with the intent of
killing it after the election,'' said Terry Stephan, Stevenson's
deputy press secretary in the 1986 race.
   Plenty of groups have formed third parties in Illinois, but none
was led by an established politician like Stevenson. The party won
enough votes to be listed on state ballots for the next four years,
but it didn't help Stevenson avoid a sound defeat.
   Then Gov. James R. Thompson - ``motivated by nothing but a
desire for mischief,'' Stephan said - vetoed a bill that would have
killed the party by merging it with the Democratic Party. Thompson,
a Republican, said the bill was unconstitutional.
   Since then, the party has stood, abandoned by Stevenson but open
to anyone who wants to call himself an Illinois Solidarity
candidate. In 1987, for instance, ex-Democrat, later-Republican Ed
Vrdolyak ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Chicago under the
Solidarity banner.
   But since 1988, Solidarity has been ``a black-led, pro-gay,
pro-socialist'' coalition, according to gubernatorial candidate Dr.
Jessie Fields, a Chicago physician.
   ``I'm not expecting to win the election,'' she said. ``This is
about much more than winning some high office.''
   The group's goal is to include more people and more opinions in
a political process they see as riddled with problems brought on by
the influence of money.
   ``These things aren't going to respond to anything but a dose of
grass-roots democracy,'' said Solidarity activist Alan Port. He is
running a write-in campaign for the congressional seat that
includes Peoria.
   Port runs on a platform calling for reducing the military to a
purely defensive force with no personnel overseas. He also wants to
change all electrical systems so people can draw power from special
hydrogen generators he says have been invented.
   The handful of Solidarity candidates try to spread the word on
shoestring budgets and time limited by jobs as doctors,
veterinarians, night watchmen.
   They stand on street corners giving pamphlets to passers-by.
They speak to student groups and community organizations. Other
than that, their campaign is invisible - no posters, no TV
commercials, no debate appearances.
   Her exclusion from the League of Women Voters' debates irks
Fields. She said she's caught in a trap: Debates don't include her
because few people know about her, and people don't get to know her
without the exposure of debates.
   But the candidates predict they'll do well just by offering an
alternative.
   ``We may not be much,'' Port said. ``But we're all they've got
at this point.''

   Well-dressed mannequins don't fool him.
Nor does iced champagne disguised as a baby.
   Highway Patrol Officer Alvin Yamaguchi watches the car-pool
lanes in Los Angeles, searching for people trying to beat the
two-to-a-car minimum.
   ``People will try anything to fool us,'' Yamaguchi said.
   Take the woman driving a Mercedes-Benz. She used a department
store mannequin with $100 sunglasses, makeup and stylish clothes.
   Then there was the man with a baby seat covered by a blanket.
   ``I pointed at him to take it off,'' he said. ``When he did
there was a bottle of champagne on ice.''
   Others pose mannequins in a sleeping posture. Then there are the
drivers who pretend to have lively discussions with their inanimate
passengers.
   Nearly 9,000 people were cited for car-pool lane violations on
Los Angeles freeways last year, despite fines that jump to $613.50
for people caught three times within two years.
   Once caught, some commuters resort to logic. Their logic.
Pregnant women have argued to no avail they were carrying a second
passenger. One undertaker thought the dead body in the back would
qualify. He lost, too.
   Motorists delight in pointing out violators to the patrol.
   ``They love it when we pull (violators) over,'' Yamaguchi said.
``They'll honk then, too, and wave and smile.''
   Yamaguchi's favorite is the driver seated beside a German
shepherd secured by a safety belt.
   ``This guy told me that he shouldn't get cited because the dog
was a family member,'' Yamaguchi said.

   New motion-sensitive light switches installed
at a university are keeping professors on their toes.
   Traditional toggle switches were replaced by the energy-saving
devices in 180 offices at California State University at
Northridge.
   Professors say it was a dimwitted idea.
   ``There was a woman across the hall engaging in all sorts of
gymnastics in her office to keep the light on,'' said Professor Max
Lupal, who had the device removed because it observed only a wall
and didn't pick up movement.
   His colleague James Sefton complained he had to get up from his
chair 10 times in three hours and wave to convince the switch he
was there.
   University engineer Alan McDonald said the $110 switches were
part of a $1.1 million energy-saving project. The entire cost of
the Watt Watcher switches was $20,000.
   University manager Martin Holzman said the switches are expected
to pay for themselves in about six years.
   English Professor Marvin Klotz said it would have been cheaper
to keep the old-fashioned switches. He and his colleagues are
entirely capable of remembering to turn off the lights when they
leave, he said.

<HEAD>Officials Propose Solution to Nuclear Plant Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials have come up with a plan
to remove and store two highly radioactive uranium fuel assemblies
dangling precariously inside the Indian Point 3 nuclear reactor.
   The 14-foot, 1,200-pound assemblies were accidentally pulled
from the core of the reactor during refueling last week and became
snagged. They are far too radioactive for workers to try to fix the
problem and put them back in place.
   Officials are worried the assemblies could drop back into the
core, damaging equipment and releasing radioactive gases inside the
plant.
   The New York Power Authority, which owns and operates the plant,
wants to move the assemblies to special steel baskets in a storage
area next the reactor, and eventually transfer them to the plant's
spent fuel rod storage pool, spokesman Carl Patrick said Wednesday.
   The agency planned to present the proposal to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission today or Friday for approval, said another
authority spokesman, Todd Forte.
   Both assemblies consist of 204 thin metal rods and hold hundreds
of ceramic uranium pellets. They are dangling in water from a heavy
metal plate suspended from a crane.
   NRC spokesman Karl Abraham has said radiation wouldn't escape
the plant if the assemblies fell.
   The 14-year-old plant was removed from service Sept. 15 for
refueling and maintenance.
   Other work in the containment building has been suspended until
the problem is solved. Forte said it isn't clear how long the
problem would delay electricity production, which was supposed to
resume by Thanksgiving weekend.
   Indian Point 3, a 600-megawatt reactor, is about 35 miles north
of New York City.

<TEXT>
   In an attempt to win back voters, the leaders of
Italy's Communist Party have decided to abandon communism - in name
and philosophy - and become a more mainstream leftist party.
   The leadership on Wednesday backed Party Secretary Achille
Occhetto's proposal that the largest Communist organization in the
West and the second-largest political group in Italy be named
``Democratic Party of the Left.''
   The final vote comes at a special party congress in January and
Occhetto commands a majority in the party.
   The leadership's decision was more than a year in the making.
   It was aimed at keeping pace with the changes sweeping Europe,
reversing an electoral slide and ending the stigma that has kept
the party out of national government for 43 years.
   In a speech Wednesday to party members, Occhetto modified the
party's emblem - a hammer, sickle and star. In the new symbol, the
emblem would be smaller and depicted beneath a tree symbolizing
liberty, strong roots and love of nature, Occhetto said.
   A small group of hard-liners burned a copy of the proposed
symbol outside party headquarters, the Italian news agency AGI
reported.
   In his speech, Occhetto criticized the Communist model of rigid
centralized economies while calling for regulation to protect the
poor and the environment.
   He appealed to the party to embrace the interests of workers,
feminists, environmentalists, pacifists and leftist Catholics, and
called on the Socialists, Italy's No. 3 party, to unite to form a
government.
   The Socialists have been lukewarm to Occhetto's proposals and
indicated the party would still not be welcome in the non-communist
Socialist International.
   The Socialists, who have been coalition partners with the
conservative Christian Democrats in the last decade, hope to
surpass the Communists and become de facto leaders of the Italian
left.
   Occhetto presented the proposed name change at a meeting of his
party leadership, taking personal responsibility for the radical
turn. He said the new symbol would include the hammer and sickle to
represent ``the historical function of the workers' movement.''
   In recent elections, the Communists have held on to their No. 2
position but have dropped from the 34 percent of the vote received
in 1976, when they came to the brink of power, to around 27
percent.
   It has been even lower in some local elections.
   Still, in a Europe that has seen ruling Communist parties
toppled in the East and the once powerful French party reduced to
less than 7 percent of the vote, Italy's Communists stand out as
major vote-getters.
   Occhetto won support for radical change at a special party
congress in March but at the price of a split with hard-line
Communists.
   His plan won 66 percent of the vote, with 34 percent of the
delegates known as the ``no front'' opposed.
   The party split surfaced again in August on a parliamentary vote
on Italy's participation in the multinational naval task force in
the Persian Gulf.
   Occhetto and his mainline allies abstained on the vote while the
``no front'' voted against.
   The Italian Communist Party was formed in 1921 in a breakway
from the Socialists. It went underground during Fascism, played a
major role in the Resistance and briefly served in coalition
governments after World War II.
   But it has been locked out of the central government since 1947,
although it holds many key posts in the country.
   The Italian Communists long ago proclaimed their independence
from Moscow when an international Communist front was seen as a
threat to the West.
   They have also supported Italy's membership in NATO, although
the U.S. government has been wary of their stand on strategic
issues.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Magellan spacecraft has found sand
dunes on Venus despite low wind and little loose sediment on the
planet.
   ``They look a lot like sand dunes on Earth,'' said Ray Arvidson,
a geologist from Washington University in St. Louis and a Magellan
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``This is a fairly rare occurrence on Venus,'' he said
Wednesday. ``This area just had a beautiful supply of sediment to
be reworked into dunes.''
   Magellan's pictures revealed the dune field in an area of Los
Angeles-sized meteorite craters. The field is 30 to 40 miles long,
and each dune is hundreds of yards wide, Arvidson said. Magellan
hasn't determined their height.
   Magellan's images have shown Venus has very little loose
sediment. That's because the planet lacks water to erode rock.
   Surface winds on Venus measure only a few miles per hour, but
the atmosphere is so dense that even such light winds can lift
sediment, he said. Atmospheric pressure on Venus' surface is 90
times the pressure at sea level on Earth.
   Arvidson said the sediment that was blown around to form the
dunes may have stemmed from a meteorite impact that shattered or
melted rock. Another possibility is that the meteorite was a
water-rich comet, he added.
   Magellan bounces radar off Venus to make pictures and maps of
the planet, which can't be photographed with optical cameras
because of its thick cloud cover.
   The pictures have shown numerous volcanoes, volcanic collapse
craters, long rivers of solidified lava, extensive faults, deep
valleys and towering ridges.
   Magellan began orbiting Venus on Aug. 10 after a roundabout trip
from Earth of 948 million miles. The spacecraft was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989. Magellan and Venus were 158.6
million miles from Earth on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Republican Pierre Rinfret is asking voters to
support his underdog campaign for governor by calling a 1-900
number - at $9.95 a call - to hear a recorded message from him.
   The number is being promoted in a 60-second TV commercial in
which Rinfret calls on voters to ``get rid of'' Democratic Gov.
Mario Cuomo because he opposes the death penalty. The ad was to
begin airing today on WWOR.
   Rinfret's cash-strapped campaign paid $25,000 to have the ad run
nine times over three days, said John Denny, deputy campaign
manager.
   Each call will bring the campaign $8.
   ``It's not a sign of trouble. Don't be silly!'' Rinfret said at
a news conference. ``It's a sign of innovation. Why do I have to do
everything the old way?''
   Rinfret's campaign also spent $26,000 to promote a 1-900 number
in radio and newspaper ads nd direct mailings. That number is
cheaper - it costs $5, of which $3 will go to the campaign - but
its message is the same.
   Denny said 53 radio spots will run on five or six stations.
   Last week, Rinfret, who is trailing badly in the polls and is
given practically no chance of beating Cuomo, reported that his
campaign had less than $94,000 in the bank. He also reported
$188,571 in unpaid bills.
   Cuomo reported having almost $6.1 million in his campaign
account.

<HEAD>GAO Says Nuclear Storage Tanks More Dangerous Than Previously
Thought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins has ordered
a new assessment of nuclear waste storage dangers at Hanford in
response to a federal report warning that an explosion could give
nearby residents cancer.
   The report on storage tanks at the government's nuclear weapons
complex was released Wednesday by the General Accounting Office. It
contradicted a 1987 study that suggested a tank explosion would
pose little risk to area residents.
   Watkins ordered a new environmental impact statement to replace
the 1987 study, which was prepared by Battelle Pacific Northwest
Laboratory, a Hanford contractor.
   Watkins said the 1987 study greatly underestimated the
consequences of a cyanide explosion in underground tanks.
   The GAO report agreed with previous Energy Department
assessments that the actual risk of an explosion is low. But it
cautioned that not enough is known to rule the possibility out.
   A cyanide explosion would blast a hole through a tank's roof,
and people living near the 560-square-mile Hanford reservation in
south-central Washington could receive enough radiation to cause
cancer, the GAO said.
   ``If an explosion did occur, our review indicates that it would
be a major accident, with potentially more damaging effects than
those described in the (1987) Hanford EIS,'' the GAO said.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., requested the report as part of a
House Government Operations Committee investigation of nuclear
waste handling practices. The GAO is the investigative arm of
Congress.
   Hanford has 177 underground storage tanks. Of those, 22 are
single-shell tanks that contain a chemical called ferrocyanide
added in the 1950s to separate radioactive substances from liquids
so the liquids could be pumped out. No new wastes have been added
to those tanks for years.
   A 1984 study concluded tanks containing ferrocyanide carried an
explosion risk, but that report was suppressed by DOE until last
year.
   Hanford was created during the Manhattan Project of the early
1940s and since then has processed plutonium for weapons. Some
plutonium processing continues, but much of the work at Hanford now
involves cleaning up decades of nuclear waste.

<HEAD>Newspaper Refuses to Carry Ads for Movies With New NC-17 Rating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Motion Picture
Association of America says an Alabama newspaper that rejected
advertising for the first movie released with the new NC-17 rating
is living in the Stone Age.
   The Birmingham News, an afternoon newspaper with a circulation
of 180,000, became the first newspaper in the country to take such
action.
   The newspaper, which previously banned ads for X-rated movies,
said it would refuse ad copy for the Universal Pictures release
``Henry &amp; June'' and for all subsequent NC-17 films.
   ``I can't tell the publisher how to do his business, but ... the
reasonable, sane and fair way to do things is to find out what the
picture is before you decide to ban its (advertising),'' said Jack
Valenti, president of the motion picture association.
   ``That's what The New York Times and all intelligent newspapers
are doing. If a newspaper wants to live in the Stone Age, I can't
do anything about it,'' he said.
   Universal spokesman Allan Sutton said the Alabama newspaper was
the first and only newspper to ban NC-17 ads.
   The ban came on the eve of the movie's Friday opening at
Birmingham's Colonnade, part of the Columbus, Ga.-based Carmike
theater chain. Universal said it is heavily advertising the movie
on radio.
   Featuring two lesbian sex scenes and a shot of an erotic
drawing, ``Henry &amp; June'' is based on the diaries of Anais Nin and
chronicles her affairs with writer Henry Miller and his wife.
   The association's new rating excludes anyone under 18 and
replaces the X-rating.
   The X designation was long considered box office poison by the
studios because of its association with hard-core sex and the
inability to place media ads.
   In a Sunday editorial, the Birmingham News said ``smut was still
smut'' and the NC-17 rating could lead to more violent or erotic
fare, ``drawing audiences that might have been turned off by the
stigma of an X rating.''
   The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times didn't accept
X-rated movie ads but have decided to permit ads for NC-17-rated
films.
   ``Henry &amp; June'' opened to sellout audiences in its first
weekend of limited release. It took in $868,000 in 76 theaters for
a robust $11,427 per-screen average.
   Last week in Dedham, Mass., the Showcase Cinema canceled a
showing of ``Henry &amp; June'' after two town selectmen claimed the
NC-17 rating essentially meant the film was X-rated.
   ``These are isolated cases in my judgment,'' Valenti said. ``I'm
not concerned. I just think in time, sensibility and sanity will
prevail, and the First Amendment will live, hallelujah!''

<HEAD>State Investigating `Slap Bracelets' After Girl's Injury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old girl's cut finger prompted
state officials to begin investigating the safety of a type of
``slap bracelet.''
   Walgreens pulled a Taiwan-made brand of the popular toys from 16
Connecticut stores after the girl's father complained.
   The toy consists of a 9-inch strip of metal encased in cloth.
When the strip is slapped against the wrist, it wraps itself around
a wearer's arm.
   When Nicole Tomaso wrapped the bracelet she got at Walgreens
around her wrist Tuesday, a piece of metal popped out of the cloth
and she cut her finger, said her father, Joseph Tomaso.
   Nicole's bracelet was a copy of Slap Wraps, which are made by
Main Street Toy in Simsbury and have become a fad with children.
Slap Wraps sell for $2.49; the imitations cost 99 cents.
   The state Department of Consumer Protection on Wednesday began
investigating the Taiwan-made bracelets for possibly dangerous
sharp edges, said Joan Jordan, the department's product safety
supervisor.
   The Slap Wrap brand isn't included in the investigation, she
said.
   The state could recall the toy if it is found to violate the
state's Child Protection Act, which bars non-functional sharp edges
on toys sold to children 8 years old and youngerr, Jordan said.
   Elementary school officials in Pelham, N.Y., banned the wraps
last week because of concerns about children cutting themselves.
   Main Street Toy maintains its bracelets, made with stainless
steel, are safe, but says imitations are made from cheaper steel
that will rust and break.
   ``We presented our item to Walgreens in July or August, but they
turned us down because the other item was cheaper,'' said Deb
Baker, marketing vice president for Main Street Toy.

   An Iraqi Airways jetliner with more than 350 Western evacuees
from Iraq and Kuwait landed in Britain today in the first such
flight in nearly three weeks. Most of the passengers were Americans
and many were children.
   Ten weeks after Iraqi troops overran his country, Kuwait's
ambassador to the United States predicted that the U.N.-ordered
embargo on trade with Baghdad will fail to force an Iraqi
withdrawal.
   Saddam Hussein's forces are tightening their grip on oil-rich
Kuwait, said the ambassador, Saud Nasir al-Sabah, and are confident
they can outlast the U.S.-led multinational force arrayed against
them in Saudi Arabia.
   Speaking in Washington on Wednesday, al-Sabah did not, however,
go as far as to urge that the United States take military action
against Iraq.
   ``You can reach your own conclusions,'' he said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis continued to wear on the U.S. economy.
   Oil prices briefly hit a record $41.15 a barrel on the New York
Exchange on Wednesday before closing at $38.69, tumbling on an
erroneous rumor that Saddam had been killed.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average
fell 37.62 points to 2,407.92, its lowest level since May 1989.
   The U.S.-chartered Boeing 747 from Iraq landed at Gatwick
Airport outside London this morning after leaving Baghdad earlier
in the day. It was the first such evacuation flight since Sept. 22.
   The British Foreign Office said about 360 passengers were on the
flight.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Nola Day said there were ``quite a few
less than expected on board. A lot can happen between Kuwait and
Baghdad.'' The embassy had expected close to 400 passengers.
   Mohammad Issa, a language teacher from Bridgeport, Conn. with
dual U.S. and Jordanian nationality, said conditions in Kuwait were
``miserable, with people having to stand in line for bread, for
gas, for everything.''
   Robbie Faddah of Houston, clutching her daughter, Laila, also
told reporters food supplies were very low, Iraqi troops were
spread throughout the city, and many cars and trucks were being
bombed, probably by the Kuwaiti resistance.
   Her husband, Hani Faddah, an electronics engineer who also has
dual U.S. and Jordanian nationality, said: ``People are getting
scared now. It has become like Lebanon. It is descending into a
civil war.''
   The Americans and Canadians on the flight were to leave Friday
from London on a chartered flight for Raleigh-Durham International
Airport in North Carolina, said Andrew Varney, Gatwick airport's
director of public affairs.
   Until today, freedom flights had transported about 1,900
Americans out of Iraq and Kuwait. Recent State Department estimates
indicated more than 600 Americans were stranded in Kuwait and more
than 300 in Iraq.
   American and other Western men are being held in Iraq and
Kuwait, many at strategic Iraqi installations to deter any possible
attack.
   In Washington, the Kuwaiti ambassador al-Sabah said
international sanctions imposed on Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion
will fail because Saddam's economy is self-sufficient in food.
   ``I don't believe Iraq in the short or long run will be
adversely affected by the sanctions,'' he told a hearing of the
House Human Rights Caucus, a loose organization of U.S. lawmakers
interested in human rights issues.
   Iraq's border with Jordan also remains open to truck traffic,
and aircraft still land in Amman and transfer their cargo to trucks
that then poke holes in the embargo, the ambassador said.
   ``Sanctions will not bring Iraq down to its knees and force it
out of Kuwait,'' al-Saban said.
   He said the embargo was being further undermined by the central
banks in other countries who are providing credit lines to Iraq,
although he declined to name the countries.
   ``Saddam Hussein's policy now is to sit tight ... to strengthen
his grip on Kuwait and to outlast the patience of the multinational
forces,'' Al-Sabah said. ``He hopes to break the alliance, and he
believes time is on his side.''
   It is generally agreed, however, that the U.N. embargo has all
but suceeded in preventing Iraq from exporting the oil that had
been its leading foreign currency earner.
   Saddam seized Kuwait in a dispute over oil, money and land, and
in so doing boosted his share of world crude reserves to 20
percent. The Iraqis have moved an estimated 460,000 troops into the
captive kingdom.
   More than 200,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed across the border
in Saudi Arabia and aboard warships in the region. Thousands of
Arab and European troops also have been deployed in the
multinational force standing up to Saddam.

   Democrat Lawton Chiles, in a move that
could make abortion a major issue in Florida's gubernatorial
campaign, has come down squarely on the pro-choice side.
   His opponent, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, is fiercely
anti-abortion.
   Chiles, a former U.S. senator, staked out his position on the
anniversary of Martinez's failed attempt to push through
restrictions on abortion.
   As a senator, Chiles voted against additional spending on
abortions and voted for a constitutional amendment taking away the
guaranteed right to an abortion.
   But he said Wednesday his position has changed and that he
wanted to clear up any confusion over his views.
   ``I am not pro-abortion. I've always been opposed to abortion,''
Chiles said. ``But when it comes down to who makes that decision, I
think we want the woman to be able to make it.''
   Chiles has pledged to veto any legislation restricting a woman's
right to choose. But he admitted he had trouble with the label
``pro-choice'' until recently because it was ``equated with ...
that we don't care about life.''
   He said that if elected, he would try to reduce the number of
abortions by increasing spending on family planning, sex education
and school health services and to improve pre-natal care.
   Chiles made his comments during a pro-choice forum at the
Capitol, where a year ago thousands demonstrated while lawmakers
shot down Martinez's proposals to limit abortions. The session was
the first in the nation after the U.S. Supreme Court's Webster
ruling gave states greater authority on the abortion question.
   Abortion so far hasn't been a major campaign issue.
   ``If abortion is an issue, I would say the governor made that an
issue when he called a special session last year,'' Chiles said.
``I don't think any one issue will decide the campaign.''
   Martinez has repeatedly said he felt compelled to call the
session after the Webster ruling because of his deep personal
opposition to abortion.
   J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich, Martinez's campaign manager, said,
``It's an interesting contrast between the governor's principles on
this issue and Lawton Chiles' prostitution of it.''
   The National Abortion Rights Action League took out full-page
ads Wednesday in several newspapers with the headline ``We
remember, Governor Martinez,'' urging people to vote against
Martinez on Nov. 6.

   The editor of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
says he has survived a mutiny by reporters who say they want to
raise plummeting circulation by replacing rambling speech text with
readable copy.
   Pravda today published an unsigned denial of reports that the
newspaper's Communist Party organization called last week for the
resignation of Ivan Frolov, who was appointed editor one year ago.
   The notice, buried on page eight, acknowledged that the
newspaper's party organization had ``sharp, sometimes tough''
discussions during two days of meetings and that ``criticism of the
leadership was expressed.''
   But, it said, the meetings ``did not adopt a no-confidence
resolution in the chief editor.''
   Frolov said at an unusual news conference on Wednesday that
``these people thought they could organize a mini-coup.''
   Outside in the hallway, Pravda writers held what they called a
``parallel'' news conference about their efforts to unseat Frolov.
They said they sought to improve the newspaper, officially
described as the ``organ of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party.''
   Pravda satirist Vladislav Yegorov told reporters leaving the
Frolov news conference that the party organization at the newspaper
had passed a resolution asking the Central Committee to ``review
the question of the editorial board.''
   He said that 140 workers at Pravda who are members of the
Communist Party cell had considered calling for Frolov's
resignation but dropped the idea as too provocative.
   Last year Pravda's circulation dropped by 3 million, to about 7
million, and it appears to be falling further during a subscription
drive now under way, Yegorov said.
   He said readers were bored by the format of Pravda, which this
week has devoted its pages to the full texts of speeches from a
two-day meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee - a body
of diminishing relevance in Soviet politics.
   ``Our readers don't want that,'' said Yegorov. ``The most
important thing is to make it a newspaper that is interesting to
readers.''
   The Supreme Soviet parliament has erased limits on the
circulation of periodicals, but subscribers must sign up this fall
for publications they wish to receive next year.
   Yegorov told reporters that subscribers in one ``central Russian
town,'' which he declined to identify, had fallen from 9,000 to 240
in the current subscription drive.
   Frolov said the Central Committee told him he could keep his
job. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appointed him to replace Viktor
Afanasyev who had run the paper under longtime Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev.
   ``The Central Committee will examine what has been happening and
what we will do next,'' Frolov told reporters in a rambling
hourlong discourse.
   He said that ``all Soviet newspapers will feel a shock'' from
the 1991 circulation figures.
   Tamara Hlyupova, secretary to Pravda's editorial board, said the
1991 figures were not available, but acknowledged the subscription
drive ``is going very badly indeed.''

   Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the daughter of
two members of Congress who as Princeton mayor lost last year's
Democratic gubernatorial primary, died Wednesday at home of cancer.
She was 51.
   After the loss of her left eye in 1982, Mrs. Sigmund made a
trademark of her collection of fashionable eye patches, which were
always coordinated with the color of her outfits or of holiday
symbols.
   Mrs. Sigmund was the daughter of U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, a
Democrat from New Orleans, and the late Hale Boggs, who was the
House majority leader and had been slated to become speaker when he
was killed in a 1972 plane crash.
   She ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1982 and was
elected mayor of Princeton in 1984.

   After 18 hours of wrangling, the Security
Council was deadlocked early today over last-minute PLO demands on
a resolution condemning Israel for ``excessive'' use of force in
the Temple Mount killings.
   ``We have a couple of issues still to be settled,'' U.S.
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said as weary representatives broke
up a series of meetings at 4 a.m. Exiting Palestine Liberation
Organization officials declined to comment.
   The PLO had suddenly insisted that the United Nations assume
some responsibility for the safety and welfare of Palestinians in
the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, which Israel seized
in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``That's not a resolution we can support in there, you all know
that,'' Pickering said during the bargaining.
   The United States' earlier decision to join in denouncing Israel
- its traditionally close Middle East ally - had already outraged
Jewish groups, which flooded the U.S. Mission to the United Nations
with phone calls.
   Agreement on the Temple Mount resolution had appeared at hand
late Wednesday after U.S. diplomats agreed to temper criticism of
Palestinians involved in the confrontation that led to Monday's
killings.
   Nineteen Palestinians were killed and 140 wounded by Israeli
forces that opened fire on Arabs who were pelting Jewish worshipers
with stones. More than 20 Israelis were injured.
   As part of the agreement, the PLO and its non-aligned allies
gave up their demand that the Security Council send three members
to Jerusalem to investigate. Instead, it was agreed that
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar would send his own
emissaries.
   Israel has rejected any Security Council mission as infringing
on its sovereignty - but has accepted personal emissaries of the
secretary-general in the past.
   But as the council was being called into formal session early
today, the PLO registered new objections. It said it wanted Perez
de Cuellar's emissaries to recommend a course of action, not just
present ``conclusions,'' as the draft resolution states.
   The United States objected, saying that the Fourth Geneva
Convention on the welfare of civilians in areas under military
occupation makes it clear that Israel is responsible for those in
the occupied territories.
   Later today, the PLO representative to the United Nations was
asked why his organization was driving such a hard bargain in the
Security Council.
   ``We would like to see the U.N. going back to what the U.N. was
established for, namely that there should be a united United
Nations against agression and mass murder,'' Zuhdi Terzi told ABC
News.
   The United States normally shields Israel from rebuke in the
Security Council and has not supported condemnation of Israel in
the body since the Jewish state's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   But a U.S. veto of a Temple Mount resolution would drive a wedge
between the United States and moderate Arabs who have banded
together to isolate Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion and occupation of
Kuwait.
   The original U.S. draft resolution marked the first time the
United States sponsored a council resolution condemning the Jewish
state. It criticized Israel for using ``excessive'' force against
Palestinian rioters.
   The New York-based Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations denounced the U.S.-supported draft resolution as
harsh and hypocritical.
   At the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, Rabbi Marvin Hier
accused Washington of giving Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat a diplomatic victory in ``an attempt to
curry favor with the Arabs.''
   Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and other Arab states, including
Kuwait's government in exile, say Israel's occupation of Gaza and
the West Bank is just as offensive as Saddam's invasion of Kuwait.
   Saddam has been trying to link the withdrawal of his Iraqi
troops from Kuwait with an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
territories.
   The last time the United States supported criticism of Israel in
the Security Council was in January 1988, when it endorsed a
resolution urging Israel to halt deportations of activists in the
Palestinian uprising.
   The most dramatic instances of U.S. condemnation of Israel were
in 1982 over the invasion of Lebanon to force out the PLO, and 1981
over Israel's destruction of an Iraqi nuclear reactor.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six bombs exploded in
several cities in the northwestern Galicia region before dawn
today, including one in a discotheque that killed three people and
injured 46, police said.
   A seventh bomb was defused.
   Officials said the three killed in the Santiago de Compostela
disco bombing were believed to have been planting the device when
it went off.
   No one was injured in the five bombings, which targeted
businesses in another province, Pontevedra, its Civil Govrnor
Jorge Parada told reporters.
   Civil Governor Ramon Berra of La Coruna province, which includes
Santiago de Compostela, told Spanish National Radio that police
were investigating whether drug traffickers might be behind the
disco blast.
   A Galician separatist group claimed responsibility for the
Pontevedra bombings, said Parada, which hit a clothing boutique, a
car dealership, a canning factory, a bar and a bank office.
   Parada said police bomb experts defused a bomb at a bank in the
Pontevedra province town of Villa Garcia after a telephoned bomb
threat by the same group.
   The group, the Guerrilla Army of the Free Galician People, seeks
independence from Spain for the four-province northwestern region
of Galicia, but has been relatively inactive recently, Parada said.
   A police spokesman earlier said a caller claimed the club blast
also was the work of Galician separatists, but the spokesman later
denied it. He said drug traffickers as well as the separatists were
suspected.
   The disco blast killed a man and two women believed to have been
handling the bomb when it went off behind a stack of speakers, a
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Earlier, police
reported that three women had died.
   The five other bombs exploded afterward in Villagarcia de Arosa,
Villanueva de Arosa, Cambados and the provincial capital of
Pontevedra, police said.
   They damaged businesses owned by or linked to alleged Galician
cocaine traffickers, police said.
   The owners of the businesses included five alleged traffickers
of Colombian cocaine who were among the more than 30 people jailed
in June during the country's largest police anti-drug operation.
   That operation focused on longtime Galician smugglers of
contraband U.S. tobacco along Galicia's long, jagged coast who have
become prime distributors in Europe of Colombian cocaine.
   Parada said the Galician separatist group's attacks against
property linked to drug traffickers could be an attempt to gain
public favor.

<HEAD>Stanford Approves Student Housing for Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stanford University officials will
monitor a new policy that gives unmarried couples, including
homosexuals, benefits usually given to the legally married.
   ``The impact is impossible to predict at this point,'' said Norm
Robinson, the school's acting dean of student affairs.
   The university Board of Trustees decision announced Tuesday
gives same-sex and unmarried couples the same rights as legally
married students, entitling ``domestic partners'' to housing and
university services such as access to library and athletic
facilities.
   Robinson said the policy would prevent students from having to
choose between Stanford and their love interest.
   ``The change also affirms Stanford's policy of not
discriminating against students on a variety of factors, including
sexual orientation,'' Robinson said in a statement.
   Homosexual men and women will be eligible to rent one-bedroom
campus apartments in a complex previously reserved for legally
married couples.
   ``This is a significant stepping stone in recognizing the
legitimacy of all relationships,'' said Steven Petrow, director of
public affairs for National Gay Rights Advocates, a San
Francisco-based group that works for the equal treatment of
homosexual couples.

<HEAD>Northrop Behind Schedule on B-2 Flight Testing, Air Force Official
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. is running nine months behind
schedule in flight-testing its second B-2 bomber, a top Air Force
official said in an interview published today.
   ``We would like to get more productivity and results sooner in
the test program,'' Assistant Air Force Secretary John J. Welch
told the Los Angeles Times. ``Frankly, we had hoped to have both of
these vehicles in the air by now.''
   While saying that testing of the second bomber is nine months
behind schedule, Welch added that ``all the test results we have
had to date are very encouraging.''
   The first B-2 made its first flight on July 17, 1989, about 18
months behind schedule. It has flown 15 times in 15 months.
   The second B-2 originally was scheduled to fly last spring.
Neither the Air Force nor Northrop have released scheduling
information in Northrop's contract to build the planes.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio contended the company is only
one month behind schedule. He attributed the delays to deferred
disbursements of federal funding and a strike by workers at
subcontractor Boeing Corp.
   The strike resulted in a contract change that shifted the secon
bomber's flight date to late summer, Cantafio said.
   The B-2 can carry nuclear or conventional weapons and is
intended to replace the nation's aging B-52 strategic bomber fleet.
Its stealth technology is designed to foil enemy radar.
   The B-2 program has been attacked by some members of Congress
for its projected cost of up to $75.4 billion.

<TEXT>
   NASA pronounced an end to its
losing streak after Discovery completed a nearly trouble-free
mission that sent a probe on a mission to explore the sun.
   ``We showed the world that the shuttle and NASA is reliable and
can meet their commitments,'' said Aaron Cohen, director of the
Johnson Space Center.
   The shuttle and its five astronauts swooped out of orbit and
glided to a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Wednesday
after a four-day flight. It was NASA's first shuttle mission in six
months.
   Only a few problems were reported from blastoff to touchdown,
including a computer programming error discovered after takeoff
that was considered serious but no threat to the shuttle or crew,
said Milt Heflin, lead flight director.
   ``Well, today the losing streak is over,'' Discovery commander
Richard N. Richards said.
   ``If you criticize our mistakes, then you must also acknowledge
our successes,'' shuttle director and former astronaut Robert
Crippen said.
   NASA had been unable to fly a shuttle since April, when the
Hubble Space Telescope was put into orbit. Later, scientists found
the $1.5 billion telescope had a flawed mirror.
   Hydrogen leaks have grounded shuttles Columbia and Atlantis for
months. Although Atlantis is set for launch in early November on a
secret military flight, Columbia's troubles have not been resolved.
   ``The fact that (Discovery) flew and they had such a textbook
mission really makes us feel good,'' said Conrad Nagel, a NASA
official in charge of Atlantis' prelaunch operations.
   Atlantis' mission will be the fifth and final shuttle flight for
1990 - four fewer than planned - unless Columbia's leaks can be
repaired in time for a late November or December launch.
   Discovery's launch ended the longest gap between shuttle
missions since flights resumed following the 1986 Challenger
accident.
   The shuttle blasted into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on
Saturday. Several hours later, the crew sent the $250 million
Ulysses probe on a 1.86-billion-mile journey to explore the sun's
poles.
   Racing along at more than 25,000 mph, Ulysses was 3.1 million
miles from Earth on Wednesday, NASA said. The spacecraft will swing
past Jupiter in 1992 and use the planet's gravity to sling it back
toward the sun.
   Discovery's computer error was made before launch but was
discovered when the astronauts were converting the shuttle's five
computers from launch operations to orbital operations, Heflin
said.
   Automatic safeguards on Discovery would have prevented any
problem even if the crew hadn't discovered the error, Heflin said.
But the mistake was serious because ``if we erred in some
procedures on the ground, why did we not catch it?''
   The problem involved computer No. 4, used for ``housekeeping''
tasks, including monitoring Discovery's propulsion, electrical and
life-support systems.
   When the astronauts called up a computerized display of
instructions for the computer, they found the screen had been
incorrectly loaded with instructions intended for computer No. 2,
Heflin said.
   Discovery touched down on pavement in the second such test to
determine if shuttles can land at Cape Canaveral. Crippen said the
brakes apparently performed well, but he won't decide until spring
when to have shuttles touch down in Florida.

   The Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
must stop playing racist telephone recordings that imitate the
``Mister Rogers'' children's television show, a federal judge has
ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs on Wednesday also ordered
the Klan and three of its alleged members to turn over tape
recordings and other materials that lawyers for the program say
infringe on its trademarks and copyrights.
   Sachs issued the temporary restraining order one day after Fred
M. Rogers and his Family Communications Inc. sued to stop the
Klan's use of the recording. The message imitates the sound effects
and song of the ``Mister Rogers'' television show and Rogers' voice
and speech patterns.
   ``The messages are of racism, white supremacy and bigotry - the
antithesis of everything Rogers and Family Communications Inc.
stand for,'' said Cynthia E. Kernick, a lawyer for Rogers from
Pittsburgh.
   A group of civil rights, community and religious leaders
complained last week that the number for a telephone in
Independence that played the racist message had been circulated
among elementary and middle school students in the metropolitan
area.
   The same phone number was used earlier this year to promote the
philosophy of the Missouri Knights of the Klan.
   The lawsuit names the Klan and Adam Troy Mercer of Independence;
Michael Brooks, also known as M.B. Madison, of Kansas City; and
Edward E. Stephens, also of Kansas City.
   Attempts to reach Mercer, Madison and Stephens were
unsuccessful.
   The judge set a hearing on a preliminary injunction for Oct. 20.
   Sachs declined to issue a civil search warrant allowing U.S.
marshals to search for the tapes at the defendants' residences.

<TEXT>
   Mobil tried to protect its upper management
by having its environmental auditors fudge their reports on federal
violations, a former environmental manager for the oil giant says.
   Philip Olson made his claim Wednesday at a trial in U.S.
District Court, where Valcar Bowman is suing Mobil Oil Corp.
Bowman, a former Mobil environmental officer, says the company
fired him in 1986 for opposing a coverup of environmental problems
at a California plant.
   Bowman wants his job back as well as back pay and reimbursement
for legal fees.
   Olson testified in the five-week-old trial that Bowman was fired
for having ``political problems with upper management.''
   Mobil denies Bowman's claims. The company says Bowman was let go
for insubordination and disobedience and as part of a cost-cutting
effort at its Mobil Chemical Corp. subsidiary.
   In testimony Wednesday, Olson said inspectors spoke candidly
with Mobil managers but were careful in their notes and reports not
to leave a paper trail that investigators could trace to higher
executives.
   Olson said he saw environmental violations at the refineries he
audited. He used an analogy to illustrate how Mobil wanted reports
made.
   ``Let's say the speed limit is 55, and we saw a company vehicle
go in excess of 55,'' he testified. ``We'd say we saw it going in
excess of 50.''
   Mobil has argued that self-policing eliminated the need for
government oversight of plant inspections and audits.
   Bowman was fired after a Los Angeles County district attorney
made an unannounced search of Mobil's oil refinery in Torrance,
Calif., and confiscated documents detailing alleged air pollution
violations.
   After that, the company ordered certain company records from the
Mobil Chemical plant in Bakersfield, Cal., be brought to its
outside lawyer. Bowman's staff was ordered to move the documents.
   Charles Lindberg, Mobil's chief in-house lawyer, said this was
done in the belief that attorney-client privilege would keep the
documents confidential and out of investigators' hands.
   Bowman says he opposed transferring the documents as unethical
and immoral and that Mobil knew an inspection of the plant was
imminent.

<HEAD>Report: Waite to be Released in 48 Hours</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported that Anglican Church
envoy Terry Waite will be freed by Saturday from 44 months of
captivity in Lebanon.
   The short unattributed report in the Al-Anwar newspaper today
said ``most of the British hostages also could be freed in a step
that would set the stage for the release of all the (Western)
hostages.''
   The front-page report said an official Iranian delegation was
due to arrive in the Syrian capital of Damascus today to prepare
the agenda for a visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati.
   Velayati, the report said, was to discuss the hostage issue with
Syrian officials, among other topics.
   Four Britons, six Americans, two Germans and an Italian missing
in Lebanon are believed to have been kidnapped by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem factions affiliated with Hezbollah, or the Party of
God.
   Waite, who was the personal emissary of Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie, disappeared in west Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, after
leaving his hotel for a meeting with hostage-holders.
   No group has claimed responsibility.
   Former Irish hostage Brian Keenan, who was released in August,
said he was held with the Anglican envoy in the same house for a
while.
   Al-Anwar, which said Waite would be freed within 48 hours, is a
conservative newspaper based in Christian east Beirut. It is known
for serious reporting, although it is not noted for insight on the
Western hostages.
   Al-Anwar's report was the latest in a series that followed an
agreement between Iran and Britain late in September to restore
diplomatic relations after an interruption of 18 months.
   The other missing Britons are journalist John McCarthy, World
War II flier Jack Mann and writer Alec Collett.
   McCarthy, 33, of Barnet in north London, was kidnapped on April
17, 1986 while driving to Beirut airport to catch a flight to
London.
   Mann, 76, was kidnapped in west Beirut on May 12, 1989.
   Collet, a New York-based writer, was kidnapped on March 25,
1985, while on an assignment in Lebanon for the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency to aid Palestinian refugees.
   The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, which is
believed to be linked to Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal, claimed four years ago that it hanged Collett in retaliation
for British support for the U.S. air raids on Libya earlier that
month.
   The group released a videotape purportedly showing Collett
dangling from a scaffold.
   No body has been produced, but British officials believe Collett
is dead.
   The longest held Western hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The violence of ``GoodFellas'' and other current
mob movies hasn't rattled those who crusade against rap and heavy
metal. But in the early 1930s, police and concerned citizens agreed
something had to be done about the ``too live crew'' of gangster
films.
   The New York Patrolman's Benefit Association passed a resolution
calling for a ban on films that ``glorify the lives of gangsters,
gunmen and racketeers.'' The Better Films Committee of Montclair,
N.J., blamed the death of a 12-year-old boy on a gangster movie the
murderer had seen.
   The main culprits were ``Little Caesar'' and ``The Public
Enemy.'' No matter that stars Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney
got theirs in the end; who could possibly root for the coppers when
the bad guys were played by better actors (with better wardrobes)?
   Hollywood tried. Cagney insisted he was ``sick of carrying guns
and beating up women. Movies should be entertaining, not
bloodbaths.'' And when ``Scarface: The Shame of the Nation,'' was
released in 1932, a grim warning was placed at the beginning of the
film:
   ``This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and of
thecallous indifference of the government to this increasing
menace to our safety and our liberty. ... What are YOU going to do
about it?''
   But director Howard Hawks undermined the message; the thugs
stole the show. None of the speechmaking by the film's police
commissioner was as effective as watching George Raft coolly clip
paper dolls or Paul Muni gun down fellow mobster Boris Karloff at a
bowling alley, a bullet knocking down the 10th pin.
   ``Being a gangster was better than being president of the United
States,'' Ray Liotta boasts as gangster Henry Hill in the current
``GoodFellas.'' Muni's Tony Camonte felt the same way as he stared
outside his apartment at a neon sign that read ``The World Is
Yours.''
   Gangsters really weren't that different from the old Hollywood
bosses. They talked tough, wore fancy clothes, cut million-dollar
deals. They grew up poor and had little education, but made it to
the top through hard work, ruthlessness and a strong belief in free
enterprise.
   Death was inevitable - taxes were not.
   ``Because they ennoble energy and because they are low born,
cocky, and self-sufficient, they demonstrate what one can
accomplish against all the odds outside the traditions,'' film
critic Neil Gabler wrote in ``An Empire of Their Own,'' his book
about Hollywood.
   Current mob movies include ``Miller's Crossing,'' starring
Gabriel Byrne as an Irish mobster with conflicting loyalties;
``State of Grace,'' another story about Irish mobsters, this one
set in New York's Hell's Kitchen and starring Sean Penn, Gary
Oldman and Ed Harris; and Martin Scorsese's ``GoodFellas.''
   The highly publicized ``The Godfather: Part III,'' again
directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is due in November. ``The
Godfather,'' released in 1972, won the Academy Award for best
picture and ``The Godfather Part II'' did the same two years later.
   No one can really identify the first gangster film, but D.W.
Griffith's ``Musketeers of Pig Alley,'' released in 1912, contained
some of the classic elements: a young couple trapped in a war
between rival gangs, a saloon, a dance hall, crooked cops and
gunmen with nervous hands.
   ``The Gangsters'' and ``The Making of Crooks,'' released during
the next few years, included such devices as a policeman working
undercover (a major part of the 1949 classic ``White Heat'') and a
pool hall where crooks and aspiring crooks gathered.
   By the late 1920s, all a Hollywood producer had to do was pick
up the newspaper to get inspiration. ``Torn From Today's
Headlines'' was how one publicity department described the gangster
films. ``Scarface,'' for instance, has a plot similar to the
notorious St. Valentine's Day massacre.
   Al Capone (nicknamed ``Scarface'') was feuding for control of
Chicago's bootlegging operations. On the morning of Feb. 14, 1929,
four men - two dressed as police officers, raided rival George
``Bugs'' Moran's garage headquarters. They lined up the men against
a wall feigning a routine frisk, but instead shattered their bodies
with bullets.
   ``More and more is the realization growing that pictures can and
do play an all-important part in the cultural and educational
development of the world,'' said Jack Warner, the studio chief at
Warner Bros., which produced most of the gangster films.
   ``I do not mean we should strive for so-called intellectual
films, but we should strive for pictures that provide something
more than a mere idle hour or two of entertainment.''
   This was tabloid moviemaking, 90 minutes (or less) of screaming
headlines, random violence and sex as gentle as a grapefruit in the
kisser. Asked how Camonte (Muni) got the scar on his face, an
associate snapped, ``In a war - with a blonde in a Brooklyn
speakeasy.''
   Darryl Zanuck, the young production chief at Warner's, was the
mastermind behind many of the best gangster films, including
``Little Caesar'' and ``Doorway to Hell.'' Of Cagney's character in
``The Public Enemy,'' he boasted: ``Every other underworld picture
has had a thug with a little bit of good in him. He reforms before
the fade-out. This guy is no good at all. It'll go big.''
   Warner's churned out product like a machine gun spitting
bullets. Films were often completed in less than three weeks, with
directors rushing from set to set and writers at times working on
10 projects at the same time. Cagney once made six pictures in a
span of 40 weeks.
   Some of Hollywood's biggest stars began as tough guys and
``molls.''
   Spencer Tracy appeared in a series of gangster films, notably
``Quick Millions,'' when he was under contract to Fox in the early
1930s. At MGM, Clark Gable was a gangster in several films, edging
just slightly toward the right side of the law as he became more
famous.
   Jean Harlow had a supporting role in ``The Public Enemy,'' Bette
Davis appeared opposite Tracy in ``20,000 Years in Sing Sing'' and
Cagney in ``Jimmy the Gent,'' and Barbara Stanwyck was no angel as
the star of ``Baby Face.''
   But by 1933, the first run of gangster films was soon over. In
1933, the repeal of Prohibition ended the bootlegging wars and the
following year the Hays Office's production code called for the
violence to be toned down and demanded a stop to all the ``passions
that stimulate the baser emotions.''
   Gangsters remained on the screen, but soon the best films were
often parodies (``A Slight Case of Murder''), reflections on aging
(``High Sierra'') or chronicles of a time (``The Roaring
Twenties'') when silver tongues and deadly bullets gave small-time
hustlers the chance to be big shots.
   ``Out of this mix of energy, suspicion, gloom, iconoclasm and
liberalism came not only a distinctive kind of film, but also a
distinctive vision of America - particularly urban America,''
Gabler wrote.
   ``It was a . . . world where one's only hope and only meaning
lay not in higher morals, not in love, not in family, not in
sacrifice, but in action leavened by a sense of honor.''
   Camonte, with a reassuring pat to his coat pocket, put it
another way:
   ``In this business, there's only one law you gotta follow to
keep out of trouble.''

<TEXT>
   State officials have taken custody of a
baby girl born to a woman charged with letting her 5-year-old son
die after he drank about 10 ounces of bourbon.
   District Court Judge Scott Moore on Tuesday granted the Texas
Department of Human Services' request for temporary custody of
Patricia Griffin's newborn after health workers said the child
demonstrated signs of cocaine withdrawal.
   The girl will remain in the state's care pending a hearing next
Wednesday to determine permanent custody, authoriities said today.
   A state caseworker's affidavit said the baby is jittery,
irritable, easily startled and has a ``high-pitched cry which is
indicative of cocaine-fed babies.''
   Rachel Taylor weighed only 4 pounds, 2 ounces when she was born
about two weeks ago, even though Ms. Griffin's pregnancy went past
term.
   Ms. Griffin's son Raymond ``Tinkie'' Griffin died in February
after allegedly being urged to drink bourbon at a party.
   Ms. Griffin, 32, and Anthony Jimerson, 21, will be tried
together next week in the boy's death. Both face maximum life
sentences.

   President Bush has decided to accept higher
income tax rates on the wealthy in exchange for a deep cut in
capital gains taxes as part of an overall deficit reduction
package, Republican lawmakers said today.
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, a senior Republican on the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, emerged from a White
House meeting announcing that the president was ready to end two
days of confusion over his position on taxes.
   Bush made his decision as lawmakers struggled against an Oct. 19
deadline to come up with a $500 billion package of spending cuts
and tax increases to get the deficit under control.
   Archer said Bush will support raising the marginal tax rate on
the wealthiest Americans from 28 percent to 31 percent, but only if
Congress lowers the capital gains rate to 15 percent. Capital gains
- profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets -
are currently taxed at the same rate as other income.
   Now, even though the wealthiest taxpayers pay a 28 percent tax,
those making less can pay 33 percent.
   Archer said that the new proposal would seek to eliminate this
apparent inequity.

   Here is the text of the Swedish
Academy's announcement awarding Octavio Paz the Nobel Prize in
literature.

<HEAD>The Announcement:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   This year the Nobel Prize for literature goes to the Mexican
writer, poet and essayist Octavio Paz, honoring the writer of
Spanish with a wide international perspective.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Citation:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For impassioned writing with wide horizons, characterized by
sensuous intelligence and humanistic integrity.

<HEAD>The Text:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Paz published his first collection of poems while still in his
teens. Today, in his 76th year, he remains active as a writer and a
critic.
   In ``A Draft of Shadows,'' from 1975, there is a line which
provides the key to much of Paz's production: ``Seeing the world is
spelling it.'' His poetry consists, in other words, to a very great
extent, of writing both with and about words. In Paz's
surrealistically inspired thought, the words are endowed in this
way with new, changeable, and richer meanings. The power of the
poetic vocation - often asserted by Brodsky, Walcott and others -
gives the words a form of otherwise unattainable content. ``We
never say/ the words of the poem/ The poem tells us'' (from
``Return,'' 1969). In a poem to Roman Jakobson in 1976, he
articulates his stance: ``Between what I see and what I say,/
between what I say and what I keep silent,/ between what I keep
silent and what I dream,/ between what I dream and what I forget:/
poetry.''
   Paz's poetry and essays evolve from an intractable but fruitful
union of cultures: pre-Columbian Indian, the Spanish conquistadors
and Western modernism. Experiences from India and other areas are
included as well. All of this has, in shifting configurations, been
reflected in his work. His own identity, Mexican and, in its
broader meaning, Latin American, has already been explored
decisively in ``The Labyrinth of Solitude'' (1950).
   The poet himself embodies this union of cultures - it is in his
blood. His mother's family was Spanish, from Andalusia. On his
father's side the Indian and the Spanish are combined.
   One of the high points of Paz's poetry is the long poem ``Sun
Stone'' (1957). This was inspired by a magnificent calendar stone,
which still stands as an heirloom from the Aztecs, whose calendar
was based on the conjunctions of Venus and the sun. The 584 days of
this cycle are matched by the 584 lines of the poem. This
suggestive work with its many layers of meaning seems to
incorporate, interpret and reconstrue major existential questions:
death, time, love, and reality.
   As a publisher of magazines, ``Vuelta'' (``Return'') being the
latest, Paz has been a lodestar in the tide of opinion. Others have
quite simply been obliged to state their position in relation to
his. He has pursued his humanistic course with unique integrity,
which is also recorded in the prize citation.
   In his book ``Sor Juana: or The Traps of Faith'' (1982) he
applies literary history and the history of ideas in depicting
Juana Ines de la Cruz, a remarkable 17th century woman. This
erudite poet and dramatist, a lady-in-waiting who later became a
nun, is the subject of a penetrating analysis against the
background of the culture and society of her day. The work takes
the form of a portrait, one which bears the signature of a great
humanist.
   Paz has written exquisite love poetry, at the same time sensuous
and visual. ``Woman:/ fountain in the night./ I am bound to her
quiet flowing.'' In his latest collection of poems, ``A Tree
Within'' (1987), we are confronted with a series of reflections on
death. Paz turns inwards on himself in a new way.
   Paz is a poet and essayist. His poetry, with one of its points
of departure in surrealism, which, however, he has developed and
broadened under the influence of pre-Columbian culture and the
Buddhist philosophy of India and Japan, can be found, apart from
his first volume from 1933, in the ``Poemas 1935-1975'' (1981) and
the bilingual ``Collected Poems 1957-1987'' (1987).
   His collections of essays, amounting to about 30, deal to a
great extent with social subjects. Not the least important of these
are, of course, Mexican history and culture, together with art and
literature, in particular the essence and diction of poetry.

<HEAD>Holdup Note Written on Robber's Deposit Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENTICTON, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities didn't have to
look too hard for the man who robbed a Canada Trust branch.
   Craig MacNaughton, 31, of nearby Kelowna wrote the holdup note
on one of his deposit slips.
   MacNaughton pleaded guilty to robbery in provincial court
Wednesday and was sentenced to three years in jail.
   On Aug. 25, MacNaughton handed a teller a note, produced a large
knife and said, ``Give me your money, I need it,'' prosecutor Vern
Frolick told the court.
   The teller gave MacNaughton $1,296 and he fled the bank in this
south-central British Columbia city.
   When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police examined the robbery
note, they saw it was written on the back of a Canada Trust deposit
slip, with MacNaughton's branch and account number filled in,
Frolick said.
   Defense attorney Brian Adams said the robbery was a cry for
help.
   ``I think what we're dealing with is a person of some diminished
capacity,'' Adams said.
   MacNaughton has a criminal record that includes theft and
break-and-entry charges dating from 1975, the court was told.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Man Plans To Claim Ohio Lottery's $50 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Erie, Pa., man who claims to hold a winning
$50 million Super Lotto ticket boarded a limousine this morning for
the ride to Cleveland, where he planned to claim his prize.
   Ohio Lottery spokeswoman Anne Bloomberg said the lottery
couldn't confirm the winner's identity until a formal claim was
made and validated at an Ohio Lottery office.
   The ticket is the second-most valuable in the history of U.S.
lotteries. Florida's lottery had a $55.2 million winning ticket on
Sept. 3, 1988. There have been larger lottery prizes, but they were
split among multiple ticketholders.
   The lone winning ticket is worth $1,923,077 a year for 26 years,
before taxes, and was purchased in Conneaut, a small city at Ohio's
northeast tip near Pennsylvania, lottery officials said.
   Richard Hovis, 37, told television station WSEE in Erie he was
the winner.
   ``We saw the ticket and the numbers on it. It was a little bit
crumpled, but the numbers were there,'' Pierre Bellicini of WSEE
said.
   Hovis told the station in an interview: ``I'm going to take care
of the folks first, pay some debts, then redo my bathroom and maybe
Bondo my Pinto.'' Bondo is a substance used to patch rust holes.
   Hovis, a warehouse manager at Erie Manufacturing &amp; Supply Co.,
told co-workers today he had the winning ticket and submitted a
two-week notice of resignation, said Dan Wlodarczyk, the company's
purchasing and sales manager.
   Company president Cy Wellman said he arranged for Hovis to
travel to Cleveland to validate the ticket.
   ``It's crazy,'' Wellman said. ``It's our 100th anniversary as a
company Nov. 1. We decided the best way to celebrate was to have
one of our employees win $50 million. I feel fortunate. Rick is a
wonderful guy and you have to feel terrific for any individual who
wins $50 million.''
   The high jackpot created long lines at Ohio Lottery sales
outlets Wednesday.
   The lottery sold $15,299,601 worth of tickets for Wednesday
night's televised drawing. The winning numbers were 3, 17, 28, 41,
46 and 49.

   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said
today that Iraq must be told that force will be used unless
President Saddam Hussein withdraws from Kuwait.
   ``Day by day we must build in the minds of the Iraqis the
certainty that they have to leave Kuwait - if not peacefully, then
forced out by military action,'' Hurd said.
   He spoke during the annual conference of the governing
Conservative Party.
   Hurd warned that the world will revert to anarchy if the
international coalition against Iraq collapses.
   ``If it does not (hold), then despite the coalition, despite the
leadership of the United States, despite the cooperation of the
Soviet Union - then we shall be back in a world of anarchy
punctuated by explosions of force.
   ``The clouds would have extinguished the light. We cannot allow
this to happen,'' he said.
   Hurd made only passing reference to the killing this week by
Israelis of 19 Arabs at a riot in Jerusalem, and said that ending
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait must take precedence over attempts
to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Hurd addressed the conference as Britain battled in the U.N.
Security Council in New York to find a means of censuring Israel
that goes far enough for outraged Arab nations but that the United
States will also accept.
   Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major pledged that
Britain will fight plans for European economic union despite the
linking the pound this week to other European Community currencies.
   Major, in his keynote address to the conference, also promised
Britain's 10.6 percent inflation rate - the major failure of 11
years of conservative rule - will fall sharply next year.
   ``Joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism does not mean that we are
now on a road leading inexorably to a single currency,'' he said to
cheers from the 5,000 delegates.
   The chancellor reiterated that Britain still will not accept a
radical plan for a single currency and central banking system for
the 12-nation European Economic Community.

   Police fired tear gas in Jerusalem's Old City
today to break up a march by about 150 Palestinians to the Temple
Mount, where 19 Arabs were killed by police gunfire earlier this
week.
   ``World, listen to us. We are people who will never submit,''
the marchers chanted before being blocked from entering the Mount
by riot police armed with machine guns.
   Meanwhile, several hundred Arabs who had entered the Mount
earlier in the day marched around the Dome of the Rock Mosque
carrying outlawed Palestinian flags. They chanted the Moslem battle
cry, ``Allahu Akbar!'' or ``God is Great!'' and ``We will redeem
our martyrs!''
   One of the flags was draped over a symbolic coffin.
   Israeli police guarding the gates to the Mount watched the
demonstration but did not intervene.
   Another protest against the killings was held at the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre, where 70 Palestinians, many of them women
dressed in black, staged a sit-down strike.
   Christian leaders marched from the church to the Temple Mount to
join Moslem clerics in prayer. They included Samir Kafity, the
Anglican bishop of Jerusalem, and Lutfi Laham, the Greek Catholic
patriarch.
   Today's demonstrations were the latest in a series of protests
following the clash Monday on the Mount, the third holiest site in
Islam.
   Arab hospitals in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip said at
least 14 Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers in
scattered clashes Wednesday.
   More than a million Palestinians remained under army curfews in
the occupied territories, confined to their homes under army
orders.
   The underground leadership of the nearly 3-year-old Palestinian
uprising had urged Gaza residents to violate the curfews starting
today.
   But residents said few people came out of their homes after army
units drove through Gaza towns early today warning through
loudspeakers that ``anybody who defies the curfew will be severely
punished.''
   Monday's rioting at the Temple Mount began when Palestinians
threw stones at Jewish worshipers at the adjacent Western Wall. The
stoning was apparently triggered by rumors Jewish zealots were
going to march to the Moslem-controlled Mount to reclaim it for
Judaism.
   About 30 worshipers and police were injured by the stones, and
police then charged onto the Temple Mount, first firing tear gas
and then live ammunition.
   The rioting, in which 140 Arabs were wounded, was the bloodiest
of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation that began
in December, 1987.
   In the uprising, at least 758 Palestinians have been slain by
Israelis and another 278 Arabs have been killed by other Arabs as
alleged collaborators with the enemy. Fifty-two Israelis and
foreigners have also died in the violence.
   Moslems venerate the Temple Mount as Haram es-Sharif, or the
Noble Enclosure, and believe it is where the Prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven. Its two mosques, dating to the 7th and 8th
centuries, are Islam's third holiest site.
   The Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, is the last
remnant of the ancient Jewish temple destroyed by the Romans in the
year 70. It is Judaism's holiest place.

   Iranian moderates allied with President
Hashemi Rafsanjani's government on Thursday won nearly all seats on
a constitutional body in elections in which many of their radical
opponents were excluded.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said only 1.8 million people voted in Tehran, the Iranian capital,
which has a population of more than 10 million.
   This confirmed earlier reports from diplomatic sources in Tehran
that Monday's poll was largely boycotted despite government
exhortations urging all Iranians over 15 to vote.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, was among
the key members elected to the 83-member Assembly of Experts, whose
main task is to elect the nation's spiritual leader and interpret
the constitution.
   Among others elected to the 15 seats contested in Tehran were
Ahmad Khomeini, son of the late revolutionary leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini; Mohammad Reyshahri, the former
prosecutor-general; and Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, who headed the last
assembly.
   The three are among only a handful of Rafsanjani's radical
rivals whose names were allowed on the ballot as part of the
president's campaign to squeeze the hard-liners out of key power
centers.
   Most of the radicals were prevented from running after the
government said they had had to sit a test on their Islamic
credentials, in an apparent effort by Ayatollah ali Khamenei, the
current spiritual leader, and Rafsanjani to reduce the radicals'
influence.
   Most of the radicals who agreed to take the examamination
flunked.
   Before the 12-member Council of Guardians decreed the new rule,
candidates for the assembly were approved by three senior clerics
in the holy city of Qom.
   The conflict over the balloting has heightened tension between
th rival factions and brought the long-running power struggle in
Tehran's hierarchy more prominently into the open.
   Since the death of Khomeini in June 1989, the anti-Western
radicals have feared a purge by Rafsanjani.
   He is seeking to rebuild bridges with the West and attract
investment to revive the sluggish economy devastated by the 1980-88
war with Iraq. His opponents say close ties with the West are
contrary to Khomeini's teachings.
   The radicals, who constitute a majority in the 270-member
parliament, have accused Khamenei, Rafsanjani's political ally, of
colluding with him in rigging the elections.
   The voting was conducted amid tight security, after the radicals
had threatened to stage protests, diplomatic sources in Tehran
said. But no incidents were reported.
   In an apparent move to appease the radicals, Khamenei on
Thursday called on mosques throughout the nation to mourn the
slaying of 19 Palestinians by Israeli forces in Jerusalem Monday.
   The killings have particularly enraged the radicals, who
consider Israel and the United States the greatest enemies of
Islam. They have repeatedly pledged to destroy Israel and
``humilate the Great Satan,'' its closest ally.
   The Majlis, or parliament, Wednesday called for a jihad, or holy
war, to liberate the Palestinian homeland.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said Rafsanjani declared
Friday a national day of mourning.

   A new bridge across the Seine River will be named
for Gen. Charles de Gaulle to mark this year's anniversary of his
birth, death and appeal to France to resist Nazi occupation.
   Mayor Jacques Chirac announced Thursday that work on the new
bridge linking Rue Van Gogh to the Austerlitz train station will
begin before year's end and be completed in 1993.
   Chirac said the bridge will ``pay solemn and durable homage to
the man who most marked the history of ou country during the
course of this century.''
   France has celebrated this year as the 100th anniversary of de
Gaulle's birth, the 20th of his death, and the 50th of his speech
from London urging France to resist the Nazis shortly after the
country fell to German troops in World War II.

   In the foyer of a New York theater where the
world chess championship opened this week, 100 exotic chess sets
shine inside a row of illuminated cases.
   Half belong to David Hafler, a suburban Philadelphia man whose
collection has been called among the finest in the world.
   Collected over 30 years, Hafler's 230 sets from 40 countries
feature figures of jade, porcelain, glass, ivory, wood, gold,
silver and a variety of semiprecious stones.
   ``There's an aesthetic value in the sets themselves and in the
art related to it,'' said Hafler. ``Most people don't realize what
variety there is and what beauty is available. It's something that
can be appreciated even by people who don't play chess.''
   The first 12 games between world champion Garri Kasparov and his
challenger Anatoly Karpov are being played at the Hudson Theater in
New York. Kasparov won the second game, Wednesday night; the first
game ended in a draw.
   The match will move to Lyon, France, for the concluding 12 games
of a 10-week face-off.
   The collection will not move with the competition.
   Hafler, 71, began collecting sets in 1960 after he bought a set
for a friend's son at a New York department store. He returned
later with his wife, Gertrude, to buy a set for himself.
   ``Gert looked up and said, `Let's get this one, too,''' he said.
   ``I said, `We don't need another set.' She said, `Well, you like
that one; I like this one.' So we got another set and that was the
start - once you get more than one of something that you don't
really need, you've become a collector,'' he said.
   Hafler later asked U.S. embassies to help him locate dealers.
The designer of specialized audio equipment also scheduled overseas
business trips to coincide with auctions.
   Hafler's oldest complete set is a 15th- or 16th-century French
set of topaz and crystal.
   He has a Faberge original, a set Napoleon supposedly presented
to one of his generals, and an amber set once owned by Russian
Empress Catherine the Great.
   A Soviet set made in the 1930s features capitalist pawns in
chains.
   ``Hafler's collection is reputedly the best in the world,'' said
Larry Parr, a former editor of the U.S. magazine Chess Life and
Review. ``It is certainly first among equals.''
   The 50 other sets on display in New York belong to George Dean,
a doctor from Birmingham, Mich., who formed Chess Collectors
International in 1984.
   Although Hafler occasionally plays chess, he said few collectors
do. ``In fact, some of them don't even know how to set up the
pieces.''

<HEAD>Judge Throws Ethics Amendment Off Missouri's Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge today threw an ethics
initiative off Missouri's Nov. 6 ballot, ruling that several parts
of it were unconstitutional.
   Cole County Circuit Judge James F. McHenry said the measure
wrongly dealt with too many subjects and that its ballot title was
insufficient.
   McHenry said the initiative, Amendment 5, ``is not in compliance
with the procedural requirements of the Constitution of Missouri
... and it is therefore not to be printed'' on the ballot.
   Amendment 5, placed on the ballot through a petition campaign,
would create a state ethics commission and force big changes in the
Legislature, including reducing the size of the 163-member House to
103 by 2003.
   State Attorney General William Webster said he would appeal
McHenry's ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court.
   Willard Reine, president of Missourians to Protect the
Initiative Process, which legally challenged the measure, said:
``I'm very pleased. I think the judge interpreted the law right.
The initiative process is important to have, but it's got to be
done right.''

   The White House said today President Bush
would accept higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans in a trade
for a deep cut in capital gains rates.
   Bush's decision was disclosed after two days of confusion over
his position on taxes, and came as Congress struggled to cement a
$500 billion deficit reduction package of tax increases and
spending cuts.
   Rep. William Archer, R-Texas, said that under the plan, the top
income tax rate would be raised for about 500,000 of the nation's
wealthiest taxpayers. The rate would be lowered for about 4.5
million who earn slightly less, he said. The tax on capital gains
would be cut for all who make profits on the sale of stocks, real
estate and other investments.
   Bush's new tax policy faced an uncertain reception in Congress,
where many Republicans philosophically oppose any increase in tax
rates, and some Democrats are reluctant cut the capital gains tax.
   There was no immediate reaction from Democratic leaders.
   But within an hour of Bush's decision being made public, the
White House sought to lower expectations for such a deal - and
suggest that the Democrats would never go along.
   Richard Darman, White House budget director, said Republicans
had proposed a hike in tax rates for the wealthy during budget
negotiations last month, but said it was rejected by the Democrats.
   Under the proposal, the the marginal tax rate on the wealthiest
Americans would be raised from 28 percent to 31 percent, but only
if Congress lowers the capital gains rate to 15 percent.
   Capital gains - profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and
other assets - are currently taxed at the same rate as other
income.
   The White House statement said that Bush had authorized his
budget negotiators to explore such an option more than a month ago
- even though today was the first time it has surfaced publically.
   The statement said that, while Bush still supported the plan, he
was afraid that its formal presentation at this time could actually
lead to Democratic action to raise the top tax rates to 33 percent.
   ``I will not tolerate ... raising rates to 33 percent,'' Bush
was quoted by Fitzwater as saying. ``I cannot accept that.''
   The statement said that the plan for a 31 percent top rate was
originally opposed not only by Democrats but ``also by some of the
same Republicans who now favor it.''
   Archer said roughly 500,000 people will get a rate increase
under the proposal. ``Those will be at the very highest income
levels,'' he said.
   Archer said about 4.5 million people would get a rate reduction
under the proposal - presumably those now paying a 33 percent rate.
   The plan would bring a relatively modest $6 billion in increased
tax revenues to the Treasury over five years, Archer said.
   Participants at the morning meeting said the new proposal would,
in essence, do away with the current 33 percent top rate - now paid
by upper middle-class taxpayers.
   In essence, GOP lawmakers said, Bush's proposal would flatten
out the so-called ``bubble'' in the tax code, the anomaly under
which tax rates on additional income are now lower for the
wealthiest Americans than they are for some who are less wealthy.
   Instead, there would be three distinct tax brackets. The 15
percent bracket for lower-income Americans would remain. Then,
above a certain income level, the taxes for additional income would
jump to 28 percent; and finally, move to 31 percent.
   Bush earlier in the week had indicated that he was open to a
compromise trading higher taxes on the wealthy for a lower
capital-gains rate. However, he then appeared to back away under
pressure from GOP senators.
   The confusion created by Bush's apparent wavering on the issue
slowed down congressional consideration of a budget compromise and
led Democratic leaders to accuse Bush of indecision.
   ``He said, without equivocation, this is what we wanted to do,''
Archer said in comments echoed by other Republicans who attended
the morning meeting.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said that Bush was
``inflexible'' on the new 31 percent rate ``as I understand it, as
of this morning.''
   Michel said, ``The president wanted to clearly stake out where
he was on that issue.''
   Earlier, Senate leaders reported progress in efforts to agree on
a deficit-reduction plan after the House Ways and Means Committee
approved a $144 billion bill to raise taxes on gasoline, tobacco,
alcohol and the earnings of higher-income Americans.
   ``What we are trying to do is see if we can develop a
comprehensive package that is acceptable to a majority of
Democratic and Republican members,'' Senate Majority Leader George
J. Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters.
   ``We believe we have made progress,'' he said after meeting with
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and leaders of the Finance
Committee.
   The House bill approved by the Ways and Means Committee bill
eliminates a proposed tax on heating oil; lessens an increase in
the tax on gasoline; drops $12 billion in tax incentives for
investors in small corporations and reduces the proposed increase
in premiums that retirees pay for Medicare coverage of doctors'
bills.
   The Medicare premium, now $28.60 a month, would rise gradually
to $46.50. The annual $75 deductible that beneficiaries pay for
hospital care before Medicare starts paying would be raised to $100
next year and to $125 in 1992.
   Overall, the new plan would mean a 2.4 percent tax increase on
people with incomes of $200,000 or more, compared with 1.7 percent
in the earlier version. For those with incomes from $30,000 to
$40,000, the new plan would raise taxes by 3 percent, compared with
2.9 percent in the earlier plan.
   People with incomes under $10,000 would face a 6.9 percent
overall tax increase under the Ways and Means bill, down from 7.6
percent in the earlier bill.

   Tropical Storm Marco buffeted Florida's Gulf
Coast with 65 mph winds and up to 5 inches of rain this morning
before starting to weaken as it hugged land in the Tampa Bay area.
   On its way it it cut power to at least 14,000 people, closed
schools and shut down a bridge.
   Bermuda, meanwhile, braced for Hurricane Lili, upgraded from
tropical storm status Wednesday as its winds neared 75 mph. At
noon, Lili was centered about 145 miles southeast of Bermuda.
   Forecasters said Bermuda began feeling the effects of Lili this
morning with rain showers, thunderstorms and gusty winds. Hurricane
conditions on the island were possible later today, according to
the hurricane center.
   At noon EDT, Marco's center was located about five miles north
of Clearwater and moving north at 9 mph. Its sustained winds had
dropped to 45 mph, from 65 mph earlier in the day. Storm-force
winds extended outward 150 miles over open Gulf waters and 50 miles
east of the center, mostly over land. Forecasters said the sweep of
winds over land would gradually weaken the storm.
   ``It was a difficult night but I think we came out better than
we expected,'' Chris Eversole of Sarasota Emergency Management
Preparedness said at daybreak. ``It looks like the worst may be
over. The winds are calming and the rain is subsiding.''
   The 150-foot Sunshine Skyway Bridge over Tampa Bay was shut down
by the winds, The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, the Florida Highway
Patrol said. Power lines were toppled and schools were closed in
Manatee and Sarasota counties because of heavy rain and winds,
authorities said.
   Emergency management officials said 14,000 Sarasota County
residents were without power early today, but by 7 a.m. it had been
restored to all but 4,600. Scattered outages also were reported in
the Bradenton area.
   In Manatee County, 35,000 residents lost power overnight. By
late morning 10,000 customers were still out.
   A motorist in Sarasota was seriously hurt when a tree fell on
his car.
   Marco was expected to push tides 1 to 3 feet above normal, scour
the sandy beaches and dump 3 or more inches of rain in some
sections.
   All Red Cross chapters on the Gulf Coast from the Keys to the
Panhandle were on alert and ready to open shelters, state disaster
specialist Karen Wescott said. Two shelters opened in Bradenton for
voluntary evacuees.
   In the Keys, trucks and vans were advised to stay off bridges
because of strong gusts.
   Myton Ireland, owner of a marina on the barrier island Sanibel,
hauled nine boats, all 40 feet or longer, onto land Wednesday.
   ``We're prepared, as prepared as we're going to be,'' Ireland
said. ``If we wait too late and then it blows hard, we're in
trouble.''
   While potentially damaging, Marco also could give the state some
relief from a drought, Case said.
   ``We've got  tap on the tropics,'' he said. ``We've got a
mechanism here where we can bring tropical air up over the
southeastern United States and have the mechanism squeeze it like
you would a sponge.''
   Jimmy Brooks, a water manager in Inverness, said residents still
will need to conserve. ``Every drop helps, but we didn't get into
this situation overnight and one storm will not bring us out of
this drought situation,'' he said.
   In North Carolina, rains attributed to Marco flooded roads and
were blamed for two highway deaths. They may also have caused a
freight train to jump its tracks, officials said.
   The deluge was welcome in at least one place.
   The more than four inches of rain that drenched the Florida
peninsula also doused the biggest part of a 40-day-old fire in the
Okefenokee Swamp. Ignited by lightning, the fire has blackened more
than 20,000 of the swamp's 438,000 acres.
   Officials at the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge said today
that peat moss in the swamp is likely to continue smoldering,
however.
   ``The fire essentially has gone underground,'' said Dorn
Whitmore, a refuge spokesman. ``The peat will smolder till the
swamp floods. But the fire won't advance anymore.''
   Marco is the 13th named storm of Atlantic season, which runs
from June through November. Seven have become hurricanes. Tropical
storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph.

   Brenda Selinger is pulling out of the race
for state's attorney in Slope County. That should be a relief for
the incumbent - her husband, Bruce.
   The Selingers lived happily under one roof while both ran for
the job.
   Selinger said it was never a grudge match between the two
lawyers. Mrs. Selinger even admitted her husband was doing a fine
job as prosecutor.
   ``We couldn't decide which of us wanted the job, so we both took
out petitions,'' Selinger said.
   Mrs. Selinger, with a 2-year-old child at home and a full-time
job in Dickinson, wanted her husband's job because of the part-time
hours. But she has since arranged to work part-time.
   Selinger got 205 votes in June's primary to his wife's 133.
Though Mrs. Selinger is quitting the race her name will appear
along with her husband's on the Nov. 6 ballot.
   ``There were a lot of questions on people's faces,'' Mrs.
Selinger said of the months she and her husband were political
opponents. ``We just laughed and said we were trying to keep things
interesting in Slope County.''

   A juror began shouting in open court today at
the father of murder victim Yusuf Hawkins, interrupting
deliberations in the trial of a white man charged in the black
teen-ager's death.
   The defense moved for a mistrial based on the juror's
profanity-laced antagonism, but Justice Thaddeus Owens ruled that
the proceedings would go on.
   The exchange occurred shortly before noon as the jury sat in the
courtroom listening to a reading of testimony by the defendant,
Charles Stressler. He is one of several whites charged in Hawkins'
August 1989 death in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.
   Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, watched from the spectator
seats.
   Suddenly one of the jurors, Lydia Bermudez, yelled at Stewart:
``You've been doing that to me every day. You know what I'm talking
about. You've been doing it every ... day.''
   The juror did not say what she meant, but Stewart said later he
took her to be objecting to being looked at.
   ``If she can't stand the father of the victim looking at her,
get her ... out of here,'' he said. ``I look at everybody on the
jury. I don't care who she is, I look at everybody on the jury.''
   After the outburst, Owens called the juror and lawyers to
chambers, where Stressler's lawyer, Jacob B. Evseroff, moved for
dismissal of the indictment, mistrial or Stewart's exclusion from
the courtroom.
   Owens denied all three motions.
   Bermudez had indicated to the judge that she felt intimidated by
Stewart and asserted: ``I don't need this aggravation from this
freaking low-life ...''
   The jury received the case Wednesday evening after hearing the
defense argue that Stressler, 22, was little more than a bystander
while prosecutors said he waqs guilty of murder for acting in
concert with other members of the white mob.
   In earlier trials, Joey Fama, 19, was convicted of murdering
Hawkins, and Keith Mondello, also 19, was acquitted of murder and
manslaughter, but was convicted on several lesser charges.
   John Vento was convicted of menacing and unlawful imprisonment.
His jury deadlocked on murder and riot counts and he is awaiting
retrial.
   Four other young white men will be tried later for their alleged
roles in the attack.

   The White House said today President Bush
would accept higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans in exchange
for a deep cut in capital gains rates, but prefers a
deficit-cutting agreement that omits both elements.
   Caught in another day of budget confusion, Bush said he would
not pursue the tax trade in negotiations with the House and Senate
over a package of spending cuts and tax increases totalling $500
billion over five years.
   ``I think it's a waste of time because I just don't think it can
get through both houses of Congress,'' Bush said of the proposal.
   There was no immediate reaction from congressional Democrats.
   The developments seemed to complicate efforts to draft the
budget accord before Oct. 19, when the government faces the
prospect of a shutdown in non-essential services.
   Bush held a morning session at the White House with GOP
lawmakers.
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, emerging from the meeting, suggested
Bush had decided on a strategy of seeking a package of capital
gains tax cuts combined with a modest boost in income tax rates for
the wealthy. Bush had floated that very idea at a news conference
Tuesday but then appeared to back away under pressure from
Republican senators.
   Today, Archer said Bush expressed unequivocal support for the
package again. But then the White House made clear that the plan
touted by Archer was not the one that Bush would pursue.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush recognizes
that he cannot get a good deal from Congress on capital gains and
income taxes. He said Bush would prefer a budget package that omits
both elements.
   Fitzwater offered a candid explanation for the confusion of the
past two days. ``One of the phenomenons of group meetings (between
the president and lawmakers) is people hear what they want to
hear.''
   The press spokesman apologized for letting confusion reign for
the past two days. ``I think we just made a mistake'' in not
clearing things up.
   Under the plan advocated by Archer, the top income tax rate
would be raised for about 500,000 of the nation's wealthiest
taxpayers. The rate would be lowered for about 4.5 million who earn
slightly less, he said. The tax on capital gains would be cut for
all who make profits on the sale of stocks, real estate and other
investments.

<HEAD>Drive to End Maine's Blue Law Pits Big Retailers Against
Mom-and-Pop Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mom-and-pop stores that dot this
rural state are fighting a ballot measure abolishing Maine's tough
blue laws, which force most big retailers to close on Sundays.
   While most states allow local communities the option to restrict
Sunday business, Maine and North Dakota are the only two with
statewide blue laws. Maine outlaws Sunday shopping at all but small
retailers, but exempts sporting goods stores - most notably L.L.
Bean Inc., which is open 24 hours, seven days a week.
   On Nov. 6, voters in Maine will decide whether to revoke the
28-year-old state blue law and grant themselves the right to shop
anywhere they want seven days a week.
   Supporters led by Citizens for Choice on Sunday, a political
action group backed by large retailers, contend the blue law
restricts business competition.
   The Retail Federation of Maine, a coalition of large stores,
began campaigning to change the law several years ago. It collected
enough signatures last year to force the referendum in November.
   The leading opposition group, Save Our Sundays, representing
mostly mom-and-pop stores, argues that abolishing the law would
disrupt family life, force some parents to work on Sundays, and
drive many small businesses into bankruptcy.
   Hugh Holmes, the owner of Maine Pride Markets in Farmingdale,
says he does 25 percent of his business on Sundays.
   ``We're a really small grocery store and Sunday is a really big
thing for us,'' Holmes said. ``When the major stores are closed,
it's very important to us because we do a lot of volume.''
   Craig Burgess, owner of Burgess Market in Bath, says abolishing
the blue law would be ``very detrimental'' to his business.
   ``I think the small independent grocers are kind of a dying
breed and I don't want to be part of that trend,'' Burgess said.
   ``The fact is our way of life is going to change,'' said Robert
Reny Sr., a leading opponent and president and chief executive
officer of the Maine department store chain of R.H. Reny and Co.
   ``It's going to be dog eat dog seven days a week.''
   But Aretas Stearns, president of Porteous, Mitchell &amp; Braun Co.
department stores and a competitor of Reny's, said that ``the
quality of life issue that's being raised by the opposition is a
smokescreen. I think givingpeople a choice enhances their quality
of life.''
   Stearns and officials from other large companies contend the
current law unfairly prohibits most retail stores with more than
5,000 square feet of floor space from opening on Sundays except for
the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas when they may open
from noon until 5 p.m.
   Stearns says exemptions such as the one allowing L.L. Bean to
operate on Sundays illustrate the inequity of the law.
   ``This thing is a patchwork of self-interested restrictions that
serve to keep about 12 major chains closed on Sundays and restricts
consumers' ability to shop when they want to,'' Stearns says. ``It
is absolutely driven by self-interest on the part of some merchants
who have a monopoly on Sunday sales.''

<HEAD>Soviets' Most Advanced Booster Rocket Explodes Over Launch Pad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's most advanced booster rocket,
which an American specialist believed was carrying a spy satellite,
exploded seconds after liftoff last week.
   The blast nearly destroyed the launch pad and may complicate
Soviet efforts to sell space hardware to the West.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported for the first time
Thursday that a Zenit booster ``broke up'' at the Baikonur space
port in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan on Oct. 4.
   Tass said no one was hurt and that a commission is investigating
the accident. The three-sentence dispatch did not identify the
payload or give any other details. It also did not say why the
explosion was not reported for a week.
   James Oberg, an American aerospace engineer and expert on the
Soviet space program, said he believes the payload was a satellite
the Soviet military hoped to use for electronic intelligence
gathering.
   A spokesman for the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos told The
Associated Press one of two launch pads the Zenit uses was ``nearly
totally destroyed'' and that the satellite was ruined.
   Nikolai Semyonov, head of Glavkosmos' international department,
did not say how the satellite, which he said was in the Kosmos
series, was to be used.
   He said further Zenit launches have been put on hold.
   ``I don't think any new launching will be attempted until the
reasons for the accident are properly analyzed and the destroyed
pad is restored,'' Semyonov said in a telephone interview.
   He said the rocket ``exploded in the air right over the pad''
but that no one was hurt because the launch was highly automated.
Vladimir Utkin, chief designer of the Yuzhnoye plant that builds
Zenit, told the Red Army newspaper Red Star in August that no
people are on the launch pad for Zenit blastoffs.
   The Soviet space program has suffered several setbacks in the
past two years, including the loss of two Mars probes, malfunction
of an exit hatch on the orbiting manned station Mir and equipment
problems that plagued the landings of several cosmonaut crews.
   The program recently has been faced with spending cuts and close
scrutiny by legislators trying to trim a budget deficit.
   Last week's explosion comes as the Soviets' biggest space
competitor, the United States, tries to correct problems that have
delayed launches of U.S. space shuttles and marred the performance
of the Hubble space telescope.
   Soviet space officials have been trying to make up for spending
cuts by wooing foreign customers for their launch services, and the
Zenit rocket was their showcase to the West. They face stiff
competition from the Americans and Europeans, who are also offering
launch services and satellites.
   President Bush opened the way in August for a U.S. company to
help build a space port in Australia to launch Zenit rockets. The
Soviets want to supply $308 million worth of rockets and technology
over the next 10 years for launches of American-built satellites at
the new center.
   Oberg said the Zenit contained the Soviet Union's most advanced
propulsion system and was its ``showcase rocket'' for luring
foreign customers.
   ``They were counting on it to make some money. This is a blow to
their space commercialization effort, but one that they'll probably
overcome,'' Oberg said in a telephone interview from his home in
Galveston county, Texas.
   The Soviets rarely report accidents involving military space
payloads. Oberg, who has written a book on Soviet space disasters,
said he believes disclosure of last week's explosion was prompted
by commercial considerations.
   ``If it's realized they're telling the truth on it, they'll
probably emerge stronger, continuing to earn the trust of customers
by being straight with them,'' Oberg said.
   He noted that the French are continuing to sell the services of
their Ariane rocket booster, and the Americans continue to peddle
their Centaur and Delta rockets despite explosions.
   Semyonov also attempted to minimize long-range implications of
the explosion.
   ``Of course the consequences are heavy, but we shouldn't
over-dramatize it. Such accidents do happen from time to time
everywhere else in the world, including in the USA, Japan and other
countries,'' he said.
   According to Oberg, the Soviets usually claim Kosmos satellites
are for ``scientific research'' but that the term is a camouflage
for military use.
   Last week's explosion is the first of a Zenit rocket, which went
into service in mid-1985 and was last launched in May. It burns a
kerosene-oxygen mixture in a high-pressure engine and can carry a
12-ton payload.

<HEAD>FCC Proposes Finders-Keepers Systems For Scarce Airwaves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators Thursday proposed a
finders-keepers licensing system to encourage business radio users
to ferret out underutilized or vacant channels on the nation's
crowded airwaves.
   Those who locate such channels in the ``private land mobile
radio services'' would be rewarded with a license to the channels,
as long as the finders meet minimum eligibility requirements and
provided that the channels could be utilized on an exclusive,
rather than shared, basis, the Federal Communications Commission
said.
   The commission also proposed to speed the reassignment of unused
or underused channels in private land mobile, whose users include
public safety and government agencies, doctors, hospitals, public
utilities, railroads and taxicabs. It does not include cellular or
broadcast radio.
   Taxicab companies, since they share channels, would not be
affected by the finders' preference proposal.
   The commission, in voting 5-0 to consider the proposals, said
``private land mobile frequencies have become congested and
extremely scarce in many areas, making it difficult for new
applicants to obtain licenses and for existing licensees to expand
their systems.''
   In other action, the FCC voted 5-0 to:
   -Give more channels, increased power and streamlined licensing
procedures to the wireless (microwave) cable TV systems that
provide cable programming to apartment buildings and remote areas
not served by wired cable. The wireless systems would be able to
lease some unused instructional TV channels.
   -Define cable systems as those using only cable, wire or other
physically closed or shielded transmission paths to provide service
to subscribers. The definition effectively excludes wireless cable
and direct broadcast satellite systems from having to obtain
licenses from local authorities and could be important if and when
Congress decides to reregulate cable system prices and business
procedures.
   -Consider changing international maritime distress
communications equipment from Morse code and manual operations to
automated or semi-automated communications systems using satellite
and digital technologies. The proposals would affect all ships over
300 gross tons moving internationally or passenger ships carrying
12 or more passengers. It would not affect fishing and recreational
yachts.
   The finders' preference system was proposed by the business
radio industry and would replace the existing system that awards
unused or underused channels on a first-come, first-serve basis
through private industry groups that coordinate frequency
allocation.
   Ralph Haller, chief of the FCC's private radio bureau, said he
did not think the new system would encourage ``bounty hunters'' who
would try to gain licenses to unused channels and then auction them
off to the highest bidder.
   The commission said it would ``closely monitor for any signs of
abuse'' and was seeking comment on whether applicants seeking
preference should first certify that they have not compensated the
previous licensee.
   The commission also proposed to streamline private mobile
licensing procedures and to cancel licenses automatically one year
after such a licensee discontinues operations.
   Haller said some discontinued radio operations can go unnoticed
for as long as five years - until license renewal time.

   A delegation of Iraqi-Americans will leave
for Baghdad on Friday for talks they hope will lead to a dialogue
between the leadership of the United States and Iraq.
   ``The problem in the Middle East between the U.S. and Iraq is
like a problem between a married couple,'' said Riadh Khadhiri, a
business professor at Mississippi State University and leader of
the delegation. ``Like any problem between couples, we have to talk
to each other and solve one problem at a time so we can both live a
long, happy life.''
   Khadhiri, 57, said he and the five other Iraqi-Americans were
invited by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, but did not know if they
would meet with President Saddam Hussein.
   While the purpose of the week-long visit is to lay groundwork
for Iraq and the United States to begin communicating, Khadhiri
said he hopes to pull off perhaps an even bigger coup.
   ``I am also hoping to bring some of the hostages back,'' he
said.
   Khadhiri, a U.S. citizen, has been on the faculties of several
U.S. universities and colleges. Before joining Mississippi State,
he was involved in an import-export business with contacts in Saudi
Arabia, Iraq and Turkey.
   As a vice president of the recently formed American Iraqi
Foundation, Khadhiri was among a group of Arab-Americans who met
with President Bush on Sept. 24.

   Picking the Wheeling Park High School

are identical twins.
   The contest is the first head-to-head battle for 17-year-old
seniors Amy and Elizabeth McKinley.
   ``We don't care who gets it,'' Amy said. ``As a matter of fact,
we don't feel like we are competing against each other.''
   The winner will be named during halftime at Friday's football
game with Oak Glen at Wheeling Island Stadium.
   The twins said they have grown to look more like each other as
they near adulthood.
   ``We can't get away with switching places at home,'' Elizabeth
said. ``We usually don't trick many people in person, but we can
confuse them with our voices.''
   The two tried switching classes in the fifth grade, but the
trick failed when they began laughing uncontrollably.
   Both are interested in politics. Their father is state Delegate
David B. McKinley, the state Republican Party chairman.
   Elizabeth wants a career in math and Amy is interested in
communications, physical therapy and interior design.

<HEAD>Report Warns Of Increasing Danger From Space Debris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional report warns that shuttle
flights and other space activity could become too risky within the
next 20-30 years if nations continue to litter the most traveled
paths.
   Already, the Hubble Space Telescope - which has enough problems
of its own because of faulty optics - has been given a one-in-100
chance of being severely damaged by space debris during its 17-year
lifetime, said the Office of Technology Assessment.
   `Even small debris particles can produce high levels of
damage,'' said Ray Williamson, who directed the study. ``The
average collision velocity in low earth orbit is about 10
kilometers (6.2 miles) a second.''
   At such speed, an object having one-thirty-fifth the weight of
an aspirin tablet would have the impact of a 30-06 bullet, he said.
   NASA is incorporating shielding for critical elements as it
designs the space station and is looking into possible collision
avoidance maneuvers for the shuttle, according to the OTA report.
   Don Kessler, NASA's debris expert at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, said the agency is warned about once every shuttle mission
by Air Force trackers that objects are in the path. About once
every five missions, he said - when the object is in an approaching
``box'' a mile high, a mile wide and three miles long - NASA is
advised to change course slightly.
   Such a maneuver has never been made, he said, because even
within that box the chances of a collision are estimated at one in
100,000.
   In the only documented collision, a tiny paint chip damaged the
windshield of space shuttle Challenger in 1983 to the extent that
it had to be replaced. That chip would have punctured the
pressurized suit of a spacewalking astronaut had it struck him, OTA
said.
   As of last week, the U.S. Space Command was tracking 6,645
artificial objects orbiting Earth, each larger than a softball and
weighing a total of about 4.5 million pounds. Only six percent were
operating satellites; the rest was debris and some experts think
there may be another 30,000 to 70,000 bits of junk too small to
track.
   Half the debris comes from rockets that drift in orbit after
boosting their spacecraft above the atmosphere. Other debris comes
from satellites, particulates from solid rocket motors and paint
chips that have flaked off.
   ``As you increase levels of space activity, unless we do
something to reduce the generation of debris, it will increase,''
Williamson told a news conference. He said estimates are the junk
will increase by 240 pieces a year, or more as space activities are
stepped up.
   ``That debris can collide with both active and inactive
satellites, damaging the active satellites and maybe rendering them
inoperative, and producing more debris from both types,''
Williamson said.
   Debris also is becoming a problem at the 22,300-mile altitude
where communications satellites operate.
   The report said international action will be needed to minimize
production of new debris and to cope with that already in orbit.
   It suggested boosters and spacecraft could be designed not to
explode or break up; batteries could be protected from explosion;
and spent upper stages of rockets could be removed by reducing
their altitude so atmospheric drag will bring them down.
   Although the OTA study doesn't mention it, nature is helping
remove space debris. An increase in solar activity has resulted in
the expansion of the atmosphere which, in turn, slows low-flying
objects and forces them to fall to Earth - burning up in the
process. Not long ago, the Space Command was tracking 7,200
objects.
   The Japanese and European space agencies are doing their share
to reduce debris and OTA said discussions with the Soviets have
proven fruitful.
   In the past, the Soviet Union made it a practice to fragment
certain reconnaissance satellites after their useful life,
presumably to prevent them from being recovered by the United
States. Recently, they have exploded these satellites in low orbits
so that the debris quickly enters Earth's atmosphere.

   Two dozen fundamentalist Christians marched
to protest the dispatch of female troops - especially married women
with children - to the Middle East.
   The protesters, in town for the American Coalition of
Unregistered Churches, carried signs Wednesday outside the downtown
Armed Forces Recruiting Center.
   ``It is against nature for women to be in combat uniforms,'' one
sign read. Others said: ``I would rather have men protecting me,
not weaker women,'' and ``Mama needs a mop and a broom, not an
M-16.''
   The protest leader was the Rev. W.N. Otwell, an independent
Baptist pastor from Fort Worth, Texas. He called women in the
military ``a perversion of women's role.''
   Otwell lost a bid for the Republican nomination for Texas
governor in March.
   The Bible mandates that women submit to their husbands, not a
military leader, Otwell said. ``How can a man be the head of his
wife if Uncle Sam is telling her what to do?''
   Bill Sanders, a passer-by on his lunch hour, told Otwell his
stand was ``bigotry and uncalled for.''

   A strong earthquake
downed telephone poles and sent people fleeing into the streets
Thursday, but there were no reports of injuries or serious damage.
   The tremor, with magnitude of 5.2 on the Richter scale, struck
about 40 miles northeast of the capital, Santo Domingo, at about
11:15 a.m. EDT, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in
Washington.
   Dominican Civil Defense officials said telephone poles were
downed in the southeastern province of San Pedro de Macoris, but
there were no other reports of damage.
   In the capital, office workers rushed from buildings.
   Officials said the the quake was felt throughout the Dominican
Republic and in parts of Puerto Rico, about 100 miles to the east.
   A quake of a magnitude between 5 and 6 on the scale can cause
considerable damage. The Richter scale measures the strength of a
quake based on ground motion and each increase of one number
indicates 10 times more force.

   Eight more students, one of them 13
years old, killed themselves Thursday to protest a government plan
to reserve jobs for low-caste Hinuds, news reports said.
   The deaths raised to at least 56 the number of students who have
committed suicide in the last month to force Prime Minister V.P.
Singh to withdraw the job quota policy.
   More than 50 more people have been killed by police trying to
quell the unrest that engulfed northern India, where the caste
system is strongest.
   One student, Sanjeev Kumar, hanged himself in his home, setting
off widespread riots and sabotage in Jalandhar in northern Punjab
state. Police imposed a curfew on Jalandhar, 210 miles north of New
Delhi, the agencies reported.
   Thirteen-year-old Ajay Kumar, who had doused his body with
kerosine and set himself alight, died in the hospital in Chandighar
in Uttar Pradesh state, the reports said.
   The wave of suicides and protests continued unabated despite an
Oct. 1 Supreme Court injunction ordering the government to take no
further action on the plan until the court decides its legality
later this year.
   Singh announced in August he was adopting a 10-year-old
commission report and reserving 27 percent of government jobs for
low-caste Hindus. Another 22.5 percent previously were set aside
for the lowest strata in the religious hierarchy, the outcasts and
tribal communities.
   Upper caste students say they will lose out on prized jobs to
less qualified candidates.

   President Bush will make state visits to
Mexico next month and to five South American countries in December,
the White House announced Thursday.
   Bush will visit Monterrey, Mexico, on Nov. 26-27 at the
invitation of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush will also travel to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and
Venezuela on Dec. 2-8 on his second trip to South America as
president.
   The president will also meet in Honolulu on Oct. 27 with leaders
of 13 Pacific island states of Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia.
The meeting in Hawaii with the Pacific island leaders will take
place during a five-day political campaign swing that will also
take Bush to New Mexico, Arizona, California and Oklahoma.
   The five-nation South American trip originally had been planned
for mid-September, but was postponed due to the Persian Gulf crisis
and domestic budget problems.
   Bush went to Colombia for a one-day drug summit with Latin
leaders last Feb. 15.
   Bush also has rescheduled a New England campaign trip postponed
from earlier this month to Oct. 23, when he will travel to
Burlington, Vt., Manchester, N.H., Waterbury, Conn., and Stamford,
Conn. for various Republican candidates.
   On Oct. 25 he will fly to Albuquerque, N.M., then to Phoenix and
Irvine, Calif., for other GOP candidates. He will spend that night
in Irvine and attend events on Oct. 26 in Irvine, Los Angeles and
Honolulu.
   Bush and the Pacific island leaders will discuss global and
regional issues at the Oct. 27 meeting, Fitzwater said.
   The White House said the following leaders have been invited to
the Honolulu summit:
   Prime Minister Geoffrey A. Henry, Cook Islands; Prime Minister
Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Fiji; President Ieremia T. Tabai, Kiribati;
President Amata Kabua, Republic of the Marshall Islands; President
John R. Haglelgam, Federated States of Micronesia; President

   Octavio Paz, who explored the Mexican
character and the universal themes of love, death and loneliness in
lyrical poetry and impassioned essays, won the Nobel Prize in
literature Thursday.
   The Swedish Academy awarded Paz the prize for his ``exquisite
love poetry, at the same time sensuous and visual,'' and for his
wide international perspective.
   It also cited Paz for his essays on Mexican society, calling him
``a lodestar in the tide of opinion.'' Paz's views have angered the
left and the right in his homeland, and he was dumped by leftists
who felt he turned on their cause.
   Paz, 76, said he was ``very, very surprised'' at being selected.
   ``Poetry is not a very popular art form these days, but it's an
essential part of human life,'' Paz said in New York, where he is
inaugurating a Mexican art exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. ``Poetry is the memory of a country, of language.''
   ``The prize is a sign that the Spanish and Latin American
literature is in good health,'' he added.
   Paz is the fifth Nobel laureate from Latin America. The last
previous was Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Colombia, in 1982.
   ``It's also a great triumph for the glorious Spanish language,''
said 1989 laureate Camilo Jose Cela of Spain. Cela spoke in Madrid.
   Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, one of Latin America's
leading authors, said in Washington, ``Octavio is one of the
greatest poets that the Spanish-language world has produced and, at
the same time, a great humanist.''
   But Swedish Academy spokesman Sture Allen said the prize was
meant to honor writers, not a language.
   The academy pointedly praised Paz's ``wide international
perspective,'' gained during a 25-year diplomatic career.
   ``Paz's poetry and essays evolve from an intractable but
fruitful union of cultures, pre-Columbian Indian, the Spanish
Conquistadors, and Western modernism,'' the academy said.
   The academy said one of the high points of his work was the 1957
poem ``Sun Stone,'' which was inspired by a huge Aztec calendar
stone. ``This suggestive work with its many layers of meaning seems
to incorporate, interpet and reconstrue major existential
questions, death, time, love and reality,'' the academy said.
   In a Swedish radio interview, Paz recommended his essay, ``The
Labyrinth of Solitude,'' and his poetry, to those who have not read
his work.
   The academy said Paz's ``own identity, Mexican and, in its
broader meaning, Latin American, has been explored decisively'' in
``Labyrinth.''
   The essay deeply affected how Mexican society was viewed at home
and abroad, and was denounced by the left and the right.
   The academy said Paz himself embodies a ``union of cultures - it
is in his blood. His mother's family was Spanish, from Andalusia.
On his father's side the Indian and the Spanish are combined.''
   He was born March 31, 1914, and, thanks to his grandfather's
extensive library, Paz developed a love for literature at an early
age. He earned a law degree and entered the diplomatic service.
   But he resigned as ambassador to India in 1968 and ended his
diplomatic career when the Mexican army fired on anti-government
student protesters, killing at least 300.
   He considers himself a socialist and a democrat, but has been
ostracized for criticizing the left.
   ``I think that if there is one profoundly reactionary sector in
Latin America, it is the leftist intellectual,'' he said in an
interview in 1979. ``They are people without memory. I have never
heard any one of them admit he made a mistake.''
   Paz has many times criticized Mexico's governing party for six
decades, the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   But Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said Thursday,
``He is a poet and writer of whom we Mexicans feel proud. He has a
universal stature.''
   The academy said Paz's open-mindedness allowed him to remain a
strong influence on contemporary literature. He still publishes the
journal ``Vuelta,'' or ``Return,'' which he founded in 1976.
   He received an honorary doctorate in 1980 from Harvard
University, where he lectures.
   Paz won the most important award in the Spanish-speaking world,
the Cervantes prize, in 1981, and the American Neustadt Prize in
1982.
   Paz's Swedish publisher, Adam Bromberg, said the author had been
on the academy's ``short list'' of top literature candidates for 15
years.
   Others said to be in the running included Chinese poet Bei Dao,
Irish poet Seamus Heaney, American novelist Joyce Carol Oates,
Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado, novelist Margaret Atwood of Canada,
South African author Nadine Gordimer and Japanese novelist Masuji
Ibuse.
   The prize, worth about $700,000, is one of five awarded in
October under terms of the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
inventor of dynamite, who died in 1896.
   Two American doctors who pioneered human organ, cell and bone
marrow transplants, Joseph E. Murray, 71, and E. Donnall Thomas,
70, won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday.
   The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded next Monday in Oslo,
Norway. The Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics will be awarded
in Stockholm on Oct. 17.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, established by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1969, will be awarded Oct. 16.

   Teen-age actress Kellie Martin, of the ABC
series ``Life Goes On,'' says playing opposite an actor who has
Down's syndrome has ``opened my mind and made me a better person.''
   The 14-year-old Martin, who portrays Becca in the weekly series,
told Parade magazine for this Sunday's issue that before she met
actor Christopher Burke she was uncomfortable around disabled
people.
   ``When I first knew that there was going to be a boy playing
Corky who really had Down's syndrome, I was very afraid. I was
thinking, `Gosh, I wish they had an actor playing him. This is
going to be very hard.
   ``But once you've gotten to know someone like Chris, who is such
a normal person and so great, everything changes.''
   Because of her relationship with Burke, she said, ``I've gotten
to the point where I would go up and talk to someone else who was
`different.' I've gotten to understand that you can be friends with
someone who is like this.
   ``The past year has just opened my mind and made me a better
person.''

   CHICAGO (AP) - Sophia Loren will receive a lifetime achievement
award Friday at the Chicago International Film Festival just in
time for the world premiere of her movie, ``Saturday, Sunday and
Monday.''
   Miss Loren estimated she has made about 100 pictures in her
native Italy and in the United States since her debut 39 years ago
as a teen-age extra playing a slave in ``Quo Vadis.''
   Her other works include ``Two Women,'' ``Marriage Italian
Style'' and ``The Cassandra Crossing.''
   Not every film makes her proud, but she said she has no regrets.
   ``You believe in the project, you believe in the story, you
believe in the director, and it's always done in very good faith.
... Each, for me, was a wonderful experience,'' she said.
   Her newest film, set in 1930s Naples, is about a simple woman
whose philosophy of life revolves around her cooking.
   Speaking from her home outside Los Angeles, the 56-year-old
actress said she never thinks about age.
   ``For me, aging is not a problem. It's something that comes very
naturally. It's what you can accomplish in life that really
counts,'' she said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Kurt Masur will raise his baton for the New York
Philharmonic ahead of schedule when he steps in for ailing maestro
Leonard Bernstein in December.
   Masur was named music director of the Philharmonic last April
and will take over next fall. He will appear for Bernstein on Dec.
18, 20, 21 and 22 in Philharmonic performances of Mendelssohn's
``Elijah.''
   On Tuesday, Bernstein, laureate conductor of the orchestra,
announced his retirement from conducting for health reasons.
   To make the New York dates, Masur postponed recording sessions
with his present orchestra, the Gewandhaus of Leipzig and
rearranged a commitment with the Bavarian Radio Symphony.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Maurice Sendak has devoted his talents to
entertaining youngsters. But parents, too, are often entertained by
the children's book author and illustrator.
   On Friday, Sendak, who has written and illustrated 20 books and
illustrated more than 60, will get something back: the first Empire
State Award for Excellence in Literature for Young People.
Presenting the award will be the Youth Services Section of The New
York Library Association.
   ``I've had a mad love affair with a form called the picture
book,'' he said. ``It is language and pictures working together. It
is about making it so tight and making it your own. In order to do
that you have to write, write, pare down, pare down.''
   Sendak, 62, shrugs off criticism that his books can be
frightening.
   ``I've always done what I wanted to do,'' he said. ``You see,
there were no ground rules when I started in the 1950s. We just
made it up. Children's art, children's books, children were less
important then.''

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - In the world designed by Italian opera
star Luciano Pavarotti there are no smoky rooms or steps to climb
off stage. The decor is in jewel tones and there is a king-size
bed, a large television screen, a videocassette recorder and
Italian movie tapes.
   Those are among the particulars the famously particular tenor
made with his reservations at The Blakely Hotel, where he will stay
while here for a peformance Sunday.
   That's not all his musical heart desires. Pavarotti also wants
humidifiers in his room to keep his voice clear, large chairs with
footstools in his dressing room - and at a dinner in his honor, and
an electric golf cart to take him from the plane to the limousine
and his dressing room.
   Pavarotti chose The Blakely from photographs his secretary made
last summer.

   ``Sun Stone''
   
   willow of crystal, a poplar of water,
   a pillar of fountain by the wind drawn over,
   tree that is firmly rooted and that dances,
   turning course of a river that goes curving,
   advances and retreats, goes roundabout,
   arriving forever:
   the calm course of a star
   or the spring, appearing without urgency,
   water behind a stillness of closed eyelids
   flowing all night and pouring out prophecies,
   a single presence in the procession of waves,
   wave over wave until all is overlapped,
   in a green sovereignty without decline
   a bright hallucination of many wings
   when they all open at the height of the sky ...
   the sun has forced an entrance through my forehead,
   has opened my eyelids at last that were kept closed,
   unfastened my being of its swaddling clothes,
   has rooted me out of my self, and separated
   me from my animal sleep centuries of stone
   and the magic of reflections resurrects
   willow of crystal, a poplar of water,

<HEAD>Israeli Army Patrol Exchanges Fire Across Jordanian Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Israeli army patrol on Thursday was shot at
from across the Jordanian border and returned fire, the army said.
There were no reports of injuries.
   The soldiers were riding in a jeep along the border fence near
the town of Ashdod Yaacov, about six miles south of the Sea of
Galilee, when they heard shots, said an army official on condition
of anonymity.
   ``The patrol returned fire, and then searched the area, but
nothing was found,'' the official said. ``It looks like the
Jordanians also conducted searches.''
   Israel and Jordan, although officially in a state of war, have a
tacit agreement to keep their joint border quiet.
   Jordan tries to block guerrilla infiltration attempts into
Israel, and earlier this year returned unharmed two Israeli
teen-agers who sneaked across the frontier as part of a dare.
   Earlier in the year, however, there were several incidents of
Jordanian soldiers crossing the border and firing on Israeli
patrols.

<HEAD>Consumer Group: Nuclear Plant Shutdowns May Force Taxpayer Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private consumer group charged Thursday that
electric utilities are underestimating the cost of shutting down
nuclear power plants and could force taxpayers into another
multi-billion bailout in the years to come.
   The charge immediately was denounced by the electric utility
industry, whose spokesmen said adequate funds for the shutdown - or
decommissioning - of atomic power plants are being established
under the scrutiny of both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
state regulators.
   But a report by Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer and
environmental group, alleged that industry estimates of how much it
will cost to close plants is far too low and that federal and state
officials have been lax in requiring adequate shutdown funds.
   ``We could find ourselves in a situation of having another
massive bailout,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen. ``Tomorrow's electric users are going to pay.''
   Under federal regulations, atomic power plants are considered to
have a life expectancy of 30 years after which many of them likely
will have to be closed and decontaminated. There has never been a
``decommissioning'' of a major operating atomic power plant because
none is that old.
   The nuclear industry as well as utilities and environmentalists
agree that there are many uncertainties in trying to determine how
much such shutdowns will cost.
   The report by Public Citizen said that industry estimates of
$25.6 billion for shutting and decontaminating 124 plants is based
on too many optimistic assumptions and that the total more likely
will be between $50 billion and $100 billion.
   ``For some reactors, the cost to decommission the plants will
rival their initial construction costs'' Ms. Claybrook said at a
news conference.
   But industry spokesmen disavowed even the $25.6 billion figure,
much less the $100 billion estimate suggested by Public Citizen as
an upper range. ``I've never heard of this (figure). I don't know
where they got this,'' said Ronald Clements of the Edison Electric
Institute.
   He said that by law, utilities must establish segregated trust
funds for the eventual shutdown of atomic power plants. But actual
estimates of shutdown costs can only be made incrementally as
plants become older, he said. ``You don't want to overcollect funds
in the first years (of a plant's operation).''
   But Daniel Borson, author of the Public Citizen report, said a
detailed analysis of industry and government documents as well as
interviews with utility executives indicates that the industry is
not adequately preparing for what the eventual shutdown costs will
be.
   Utility cost estimates often underestimate what it will cost to
dispose of highly radioactive spent fuel and radioactive wastes as
well as the decontamination of plants, Borson said.
   While many nuclear plants have exceeded a third of their
expected operating lives, so far only about $3.5 billion has been
allocated for shutdown activities and some of those funds could be
threatened if a utility faces serious financial problems in the
future.
   Clements, the industry official, disagreed. He said that new NRC
rules now being phased in will require that all cleanup funds be in
separate accounts independent of a utility's other corporate funds.
   The Council for Energy Awareness, an umbrella group representing
the views of the atomic power industry, criticized the Public
Citizen report, saying the consumer group ``lacks the comprehensive
financial and technical knowledge needed to produce valid (cost)
estimates.''

<HEAD>Ulysses Fires Thrusters; Discovery in `Excellent Condition'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ulysses started firing its
thrusters Thursday to point its main antenna toward Earth, and the
shuttle that launched the probe was in fine shape after a
1.7-million-mile flight, NASA said.
   The space agency, meanwhile, formed a team to investigate why
the shuttle Discovery lifted off Saturday with incorrect
instructions for how it should operate some of its computer
programs, said shuttle project engineer Chris Fairey.
   Discovery landed early Wednesday after sending Ulysses on a
five-year, 1.86-billion-mile journey to study the sun's poles.
   ``The vehicle is in excellent condition,'' said shuttle
processing manager Tip Talone.
   He said only 10 to 15 of Discovery's heat-shield tiles need to
be replaced. Debris that hit the shuttle during its launch and
landing caused 13 ``dings'' larger than one inch, and about 50
saller ones.
   ``That's a very low number,'' Talone said. ``Every time we come
back, we seem to learn more about how to fly and land the thing
without taking a lot of hits.''
   Ulysses' maneuvering, which will end Friday, was designed to let
the spacecraft communicate with controllers more quickly by using
its high-gain antenna, a 5.4-foot-wide dish, said Franklin
O'Donnell, a spokesman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``Ulysses began firing its thrusters to start a complex series
of maneuvers to turn itself around nearly 180 degrees to point the
big dish toward Earth,'' O'Donnell said by phone from the Pasadena
laboratory.
   The solar explorer has been communicating with its controllers
through one of its smaller antennas, limiting the rate at which
information is transmitted, he added.
   The $250 million Ulysses spacecraft is the centerpiece of a $750
million joint mission by the European Space Agency and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Six hours after Discovery was launched Saturday from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., Ulysses was deployed from the shuttle's cargo bay.
Then three rocket stages hurled it out of Earth orbit at a record
escape speed of about 34,000 mph.
   Ulysses was 3.68 million miles from Earth on Thursday, zipping
toward a 1992 flight past Jupiter at 25,372 mph, O'Donnell said. It
will use Jupiter as a ``gravity slingshot'' to become the first
spacecraft to fly perpendicular to the plane in which the planets
orbit the sun.
   That will allow Ulysses to fly over the sun's south pole in 1994
and north pole in 1995. However, it will never get closer to the
sun that it was when it was launched. To study the sun's poles,
Ulysses doesn't need to get close to the sun, only leave the plane
of the planets.
   Fairey said the incorrect instructions were loaded into one of
Discovery's computers last Thursday after that computer was used to
update some of the programs on Ulysses, which was sitting inside
the shuttle's cargo bay at the time.
   The investigators will recommend steps to prevent such an error
from happening again, he added.
   The incorrect instructions were noticed and fixed by Discovery's
five astronauts about an hour after the shuttle was launched and
never posed a danger to the shuttle or its crew - even if the error
hadn't been detected, said Milt Heflin, lead flight director at
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Heflin had said NASA considered the problem serious because it
went undetected before Discovery was launched. Fairey called it
``really minor,'' but said it ``did point out a minor deficiency in
the way we code our software.''
   The incorrect instructions were among those that tell each of
Discovery's five computers which onboard devices they should
operate during the shuttle's flight.
   Talone said shuttle maintenance was proceeding smoothly, so
Discovery should be ready for a one-day flight back to Cape
Canaveral on Monday, riding piggyback on a modified jumbo jetliner.
   Discovery's new carbon brakes, which have been tested on only
one previous flight, are in such great shape that ``you could fly
those brakes today as they are,'' he said. Nevertheless, they were
removed and sent to B.F. Goodrich, the manufacturer in Ohio, for
detailed analysis.
   O'Donnell said Ulysses will fire its thrusters again Monday and
Tuesday to adjust its trajectory toward Jupiter.

<HEAD>Iran's Abadan Oil Refinery to Resume Full Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Abadan oil refinery, once the
largest in the world but crippled in the eight-year war with Iraq,
will resume full operations in about six months, Tehran radio
reported Thursday.
   The refinery's capacity will rise to 300,000 barrels a day, more
than twice the current production, the radio quoted Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
   The refinery, which was repeatedly bombed by Iraqi planes in the
1980-88 gulf war, started partial operation in April 1989.
   An army of engineers and technicians have been working on the
complex around the clock since the August 1988 cease-fire.
   Oil exports account for more than 90 percent of Iran's hard
currency earnings.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Aqazadeh as saying
there were plans to link the refinery to a pipeline, and transport
its products nationwide.
   Iran, the third-largest oil exporter within the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has benefitted from high oil prices
brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis, which was triggered by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The halt in Kuwaiti production, and a United Nations-imposed
embargo on Iraqi oil, cut 4 million barrels a day from
international markets, boosting prices to a record $41 a barrel.

   A computer virus named ``Stoned'' made its way
into copies of the governor's speech on the future of the British
colony, adding a little spice to the dour commentary.
   Copies of the speech delivered to newspapers in the colony on
computer floppy disks contained the virus, a government spokesman
said hursday.
   The virus, which attaches itself to the internal memory of
personal computers, freezes the keyboard at a prescribed time and
flashes the message: ``Your PC is now stoned. Legalize marijuana.''
   Sir David Wilson gave his speech Wednesday, reading from a
prepared text. In the speech, he painted a somber picture of Hong
Kong's future, warning of belt-tightening and rising inflation.
   The spokesman said technical personnel will investigate where
the virus originated.
   A computer virus is a type of program designed as a high-tech
practical joke. Some simply flash harmless messages on a computer
screen while others can destroy information files contained
throughout large computer networks.
   The ``Stoned'' virus is considered relatively harmless.

popular ``Little People'' toys, the New York state attorney general
said Thursday.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams sent a letter to the commission
Thursday, asking it to alert parents to potential choking hazards
of Little People and increase the size of its small-parts standard
for toys.
   Carol Blackley, a spokeswoman for Fisher-Price toys, which makes
Little People, said she was puzzled that Abrams had singled out the
line of miniature figures. She called the toys ``among the safest
things you'll find in a child's environment.''
   In response to pressure from Abrams, Fisher-Price agreed in June
to toughen the language of safety warnings on Little People
packages, Blackley said. The Chicago-based company, a division of
Quaker Oats Co., also paid New York state $25,000.
   In his letter to the commission, Abrams cited the recent deaths
of two 6-month-old boys who choked on Little People.
   But Blackley noted that the Little People package clearly states
the toys are intended for children aged 2 to 6.
   In the 30 years Fisher-Price has been making Little People, five
children have choked to death on the figures, she said. All but one
of those children were below the recommended age range, she said.
   David Thome, a spokesman for CPSC, said a commission study found
that between 1980 and 1989, 146 children died after choking on
toys. Of those, 70 percent were caused by balloons, marbles or
small balls.
   However, he said, the CPSC staff is still concerned about the
potential danger posed by what he called ``small human'' toys and
is looking at alternatives.

   Kelbessa Negewo said he was just a ``simple man''
trying to raise his children, pursue a hotel management degree and
forget being tortured in an Ethiopian prison when the past came
back to haunt him.
   Another expatriate is suing him for $25 million, alleging he was
the police official who tortured her in interrogation in December
1978 and January 1979 during the ``Red Terror,'' a period of
government intimidation in Ethiopia.
   The suit claims that during one eight-hour interrogation in
January 1979, Negewo and several others tied up Hirute Abebe-Jira
and whipped her with wire.
   ``A stocking soaked with blood and vomit was stuffed in her
mouth,'' the suit said. ``She was told she would be killed )f she
did not reveal the location of a certain gun, about which she knew
nothing.
   ``He (Negewo) directed his subordinates who participated in the
interrogation and torture and he personally interrogated and
tortured Abebe-Jira.''
   Negewo, who now works in an Atlanta hotel, denies having
anything to do with that.
   ``She doesn't know me, I don't know her,'' he said in halting
English. ``I was a civil servant all my life. I was never in the
police.''
   Although Negewo refuses to answer many questions about his past,
he said he can prove that he spent the months mentioned in the
lawsuit attending school in Europe and in prison. He says he also
was tortured by agents of Soviet-backed President Mengistu Haile
Mariam in the period of government violence known as the Red
Terror.
   The lawsuit alleges that Negewo was chairman of the Higher Zone
9, a police jurisdiction in the capital Addis Ababa.
   Ethiopian diplomatic sources said a Kelbessa Negewo was chairman
of Higher Zone 9 during the Red Terror. The sources could not,
however, say whether that man was in Addis Ababa at the time Ms.
Abebe-Jira said she was imprisoned and tortured.
   Ms. Abebe-Jira has declined to be interviewed, according to her
attorneys, but her lawsuit said she was imprisoned when she was an
18-year-old clerk-accountant for a business.
   Ms. Abebe-Jira, now living in Gloucester, Ontario, filed the
lawsuit under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which allows aliens to
seek relief for human rights violations in other countries.
   She said she learned of Negewo's whereabouts in May after a
friend spotted him working at the Colony Square Hotel in Atlanta.
   Last week, Negewo filed a petition pleading indigency and asking
for a court-appointed attorney. The suit is pending until a judge
decides the petition, said Laurel Lucey, one of the attorneys
handling the case for the Center for Constitutional Rights.
   An attorney is not required for civil cases. Negewo said he also
has applied for help from the American Civil Liberties Union in
case his petition is denied.
   Negewo said he left Ethiopia for Bulgaria on June 2, 1978, to
attend a political institution called the Party School.
   He returned to Ethiopia on March 9, 1979, ``and when I reached
the international airport at Addis Ababa they took me to jail
directly,'' Negewo said.
   ``They said I was talking to Russians in Bulgaria,'' he said.
``They hit my legs, my soles, and I was in a dark house, dark jail
for two months.''
   Negewo wouldn't say why he was imprisoned by the Soviet-backed
government for talking to Russians.
   Negewo said he was imprisoned until 1983. He said he then worked
for several months for an organization calle Irish Aid to Ethiopia
and then for a cement company.
   In August 1987, he came to Atlanta and attended classes for one
semester at Morris Brown College. He said he then transferred his
records to Georgia State University, and plans to start classes
there when he earns enough money. He is supporting his three
children, ages 15, 13 and 11.
   Negewo won't discuss his social or family life, except to say he
is not married.
   Negewo said he has tried to bury thoughts of the past and never
thought the Red Terror would haunt him again.
   ``I'm just a simple man all my life,'' he said. ``I don't have
any money. I can't feed my children. I applied for a lawyer. What
can I do then? I don't have any position.''

<HEAD>Congress Moving To Protect Conservation Payments From Budget Cuts</HEAD>

   Congress is moving to ensure that farmers
won't have to worry that future disputes over the federal budget
will jeopardize their monthly government checks for idled erodible
land.
   Representatives of the House and the Senate have agreed to
exclude the Conservation Reserve Program from any automatic
spendingcuts that might take place over the next four years,
congressional aides said Thursday.
   The program pays farmers to take environmentally sensitive
acreage out of production for 10 years.
   The exemption was proposed by the House in its version of the
1990 farm bill. The Senate negotiators agreed late last week to the
position, said Joe Duggan, a spokesman for the House Agriculture
Committee.
   The presidential Office of Management and Budget had angered
some farmers and lawmakers by insisting that CRP payments be
subject to any across-the-board cuts made under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. Those cuts are supposed to kick in if
Congress doesn't take action on its own to shrink the budget
deficit.
   Had the cuts taken effect this year, CRP payments could have
been cut by 32 percent.
   ``This action by the conferees settles this issue once and for
all,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``OMB will no longer be able
to hold CRP payments hostage to the fate of future budget
negotiations.''
   Daschle; Rep. Tim Johnson, D-S.D.;; and the North Dakota
congressional delegation had written the farm-bill conferees urging
them to agree to the exemption.
   The Agriculture Department paid farmers about $1 billion over
the last year on 334,000 CRP contracts, according to the House
committee. About $1.3 billion has been tentatively budgeted for the
program for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The recent budget agreement that stopped the Gramm-Rudman cuts
from taking effect will require the farm bill negotiators to reduce
agricultural spending by $1 billion this year and $13.5 billion
over the next five years.
   However, CRP payments will not be subject to any of that
reduction, congressional aides said. All of the proposed cut must
come out of Commodity Credit Corp. benefits.

<HEAD>40 Percent of Romania's Ethnic Germans Have Registered to Emigrate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 40 percent of Romania's ethnic
Germans have registered to leave the country since dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu fell last December, according to figures released
Thursday.
   The Interior Ministry, in a statement carried by the state news
agency Rompres, said 92,650 of Romania's ethnic Germans, estimated
to be 220,000 at the time of the revolution, already had passports
to leave the country.
   About 70,000 of them already have left, the ministry said.
   The ethnic Germans are among 120,603 people who have applied to
leave since Ceausescu's ouster, the statement said. Independent
sources say the real figure is much higher.
   Since the elimination of travel restrictions after the
revolution, more than 10 million Romanians out of a population of
23 million have gone abroad as tourists.
   Diplomatic sources say millions would like to remain outside
Romania. But because Romanians no longer qualify for the refugee
status they had when the country was a dictatorship, Western
countries have rejected most would-be emigres.
   The notable exception is Germany, which has accepted almost
100,000 immigrants, the overwhelming majority ethnic Germans.
   Another 10,000 Romanian citizens, mainly members of the
2-million-strong ethnic Hungarian community, have headed for
Hungary, officials said.
   Florin Albulescu of German Forum, an organization for the ethnic
minority, said most ethnic Germans leave because of poor standards
of living in Romania and ``the temptation of the miraculous German
economy.''
   The country's ethnic Germans were once estimated at 500,000.
   But many left following a 1978 agreement between Bucharest and
Bonn that allowed Germans to pay their way out of Romania for up to
$8,000 each, said German Forum President Thomas Nagler.

   The Agriculture Department said Thursday its
initial forecast of the 1990-91 season indicates an orange harvest
of 231 million boxes, up 24 percent from last season's
freeze-damage yield.
   The Florida crop was estimated at 165 million boxes against
110.2 million in 1989-90.
   California production, forecast at 64 million boxes, is down 12
percent from last season. Arizona's crop, at 1.75 million boxes,
would be up 11 percent from 1989-90.
   But the USDA said due to the severe freeze of last December, the
Texas orange crop ``is virtually eliminated'' in 1990-91 and will
not be forecast this season unless sufficient commercial supplies
become available.

<HEAD>Catholic School Pledge: `Liberty and Justice for the Unborn'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KRISTI UMBREIT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LORAIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic school revised the Pledge
of Allegiance to say ``with liberty and justice for the born and
unborn,'' angering some students who said the issue has no place in
a patriotic oath.
   ``It's like changing the Constitution,'' Angela Martinez, a
Lorain Catholic High School junior, said Thursday.
   Robert Garcia, a senior, also said the change, which began this
week, was a bad idea.
   ``I feel the `born and unborn' shouldn't be added. The pledge is
a pledge to your country. ... The pledge deals with patriotism,''
he said.
   This week has been designated by U.S. Catholic schools as
``respect for life'' week, said Robert Kealey, executive director
for the Washington, D.C.-based National Catholic Education
Association. Students are being urged to reflect on the issues of
abortion, euthanasia, the homeless and poverty.
   Kealey, whose association represents most Catholic secondary and
elementary schools in the country, said he had not heard of any
other school altering the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Jerry Lackamp, director of communications for the Cleveland
Catholic Diocese, said references to the unborn in the pledge is
not policy for Catholic schools in northeast Ohio.
   Principal Joanne Miller was said to be in a faculty meeting on
Thursday and not available to comment.
   Reporters trying to interview students were told to leave school
grounds.
   In an interview published Thursday with The (Lorain) Journal,
Ms. Miller defended the change as appropriate.
   ``We are a Catholic school and therefore our philosophy is one
of pro-life,'' she said. ``(The pledge change) was suggested to us.
It does not go against our philosophy.
   ``I did not realize there was a difficulty with this until
(Tuesday) morning. I was wondering if the students concerned would
come talk with me. They have not,'' she said.
   The Chronicle Telegram in nearby Elyria reported Thursday the
phrase was added at the request of the Knights of Columbus, a
Catholic fraternal organization.
   Tom Laubenthal, a trustee with the Elyria K of C Council, said
the organization regularly uses the phrase at its meetings ``just
because of our stance on abortion.''
   Some of the 400 students who attend the school in this Lake Erie
port city about 35 miles west of Cleveland said they were not
required to recite the added phrase. But several said they felt
pressure to do so.
   ``A lot of students, when they say the pledge, say `justice for
all' and then sit down, and you just hear the rest over the P.A.
system,'' said Marcie Apont, an eighth-grader.
   Some students in the working class neighborhood had threatened
to boycott classes Thursday morning to protest the pledge change.
But students questioned after school said they had not skipped
classes and did not know if others had.
   Senior Meghan Chapple said she supported the change.
   ``I believe it's OK for Catholic schools to do it, because
that's our beliefs,'' she said. ``It has the same emphasis and
values behind it that our prayers do. ... They're at a Catholic
school and should be expected to (uphold) the Catholic values.''

<HEAD>Tax Plan Would Hit Wealthiest, But Still Give Them $9,000 Tax Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Budget-Taxes, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The wealthiest people in America would face
higher tax rates but still collect tax cuts averaging more than
$9,000 a year under a plan endorsed Thursday by President Bush.
   The plan, advanced by conservative Republicans in the House,
would exclude more than half of capital gains from taxation and
raise the 28 percent maximum income tax rate on the richest people
to 31 percent. It would reduce the top rate affecting some
upper-middle-income people from 33 percent to 31 percent.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated people with incomes of
$200,000 or more would realize tax cuts averaging $9,097 a year.
That would represent a 6.2 percent reduction in their federal tax
liabilities.
   Those with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 would get a 4.4
percent tax cut, averaging $1,541 a year. Families with income
between $40,000 and $50,000 would see tax cuts averaging $54, or
0.5 percent.
   Families with incomes under $10,000 would get nothing on average
from the proposal, CBO said. Those making between $20,000 and
$30,000 would get a $14 tax cut, an average reduction of 0.3
percent.
   The Republican proposal, which was rejected by Democratic
negotiators last month, would reduce from 33 percent to 31 percent
the marginal tax rate on couples with taxable income between
$78,400 and $162,770 and single people between $47,050 and $97,620.
   The marginal rate applies to any additional income earned.
Taxable income is after deductions and exemptions have been
subtracted.
   In reducing the 33 percent rate, the GOP proposal also would
eliminate a quirk in the law that allows people with the highest
incomes to pay a 28 percent marginal rate while some
upper-middle-income people pay a 33 percent rate.
   The bill, sponsored chiefly by Reps. John Kasich of Ohio and
Carl Pursell of Michigan, would exempt from taxation 51.6 percent
of long-term capital gains, which are profits from the sale of
investments held a year or longer. Capital gains now are fully
taxed at the same rates that apply to other income.
   The combination of the capital-gains exclusion and the new rate
structure would have these effects:
   -Capital gains of people in the highest, 31 percent, tax
bracket, would have an effective capital-gains rate of 15 percent.
   -People in the 28 percent bracket would pay an effective rate of
13.55 percent on capital gains.
   -Taxpayers in the lowest bracket, 15 percent, would pay an
effective 7.26 percent rate on capital gains.
   -Couples with no children and filing a joint return would pay a
15 percent rate on their first $32,450 of taxable income; 28
percent on the next segment, between $32,450 and $78,400; and 31
percent on everything above $78,400.
   -A single person would pay 15 percent on the first $19,450; 28
percent on the next segment, between $19,450 and $47,050; and 31
percent on everything above $47,050.

<HEAD>Most of Nation's 1990 Blood Pressure Goals Met, CDC Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans achieved most of the objectives aimed
at lowering their blood pressures during the past decade, with one
important exception: losing weight, the national Centers for
Disease Control said Thursday.
   Seven of the nine U.S. health objectives relating to blood
pressure have been met, including a reduction in the rate of high
blood pressure nationwide, the CDC said.
   In 1979, when the federal Department of Health and Human
Services prepared its 1990 health goals for the nation,
hypertension - high blood pressure - was defined as a reading of
160-95 or higher.
   By this year, the government hoped to have at least 60 percent
of Americans who met that definition to control their blood
pressures with medication, diet and exercise. One recent survey
indicated a level of 65 percent, the CDC said.
   However, the goal of reducing the overweight population to less
than 10 percent of adult men and less than 17 percent of adult
women was not reached, the CDC said.
   According to a 1988 federal survey, 27 percent of adult men and
26 percent of adult women were more than 20 percent above their
recommended weight, it said.
   Being overweight increases the risk of high blood pressure,
which is, in turn, a cause of heart disease and strokes.
   ``Improvements in blood pressure control ... have contributed to
a 50 percent decrease in stroke and a 35 percent decrease in
coronary heart disease since 1972,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said,
citing a 1988 federal report.
   ``Despite this progress, 30 million persons in the United States
still have inadequately controlled blood pressure.''
   Although comprehensive studies are not complete, the goal of
having at least 60 percent of the hypertensive population in
control of their blood pressure ``has most likely been met,'' the
CDC said, citing various studies over the past several years.
   However, in 1984, federal health officials revised the standard
for hypertension to a reading of 140-90, and progress at that level
is less certain, the CDC said.
   A study in South Carolina showed 38 percent of hypertensive
people - as defined under the stricter standard - lowering their
blood pressure with medication, diet and exercise, the CDC said.
   Progress toward the 1990 goals ``cannot be definitely
determined'' until statistics from a new national survey are
analyzed over the next several years, it said.
   Other blood-pressure goals which were met, include:
   - More than half of U.S. adults should know the principal risk
factors for heart disease and stroke: high blood pressure, smoking,
high cholesterol, diabetes.
   - More than 90 percent of adults should know whether they have
high blood pressure.
   - At least half of processed food in grocery stores should be
labeled with sodium and caloric content.
   Other goals, also met, targeted public health systems and
research methodology.
   Progress is unknown toward one goal: reducing the average daily
salt intake to less than .21 of an ounce. No studies have been done
to provide such data, the CDC said. Sodium, a component of salt,
contributes to high blood pressure.

   One of the country's leading makers of lawn
mower engines is recalling 850,000 fuel tanks sold since July 1,
1989, because they may leak gasoline.
   The engines, made by Briggs &amp; Stratton and installed on more
than 100 brands of walk-behind mowers, have the name ``Quantum
Power'' on top, said the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   Sears, Snapper and Toro produced some mowers using those engines
without the name. Owners of those machines, bought after July 1
last year, should check the engine model number on a plate just
above the spark plug.
   If the first two digits are 12, the fuel tank is subject to
recall.
   If a tank leaks, the CPSC said, the owner should arrange for a
replacement at 16,000 Briggs &amp; Stratton dealers at no charge. If it
is not leaking, owners are advised to make an appointment for a
replacement.

<HEAD>With AM-Nobel Literature, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA GENASCI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In his sensuous poetry imbued with mythology and politics,
Octavio Paz has helped shape Mexico's idea of itself and long
served as interpreter of his nation's soul for the West.
   He finds company among the Latin American literary greats who
have profoundly influenced the politics of their nations and
channeled their cultures into the mainstream of world literature.
   Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes has called Paz the ``greatest
living Mexican writer, great renovator of the Spanish language,
great universal poet and essayist.''
   Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa said Paz was ``one of the
greatest poets that the Spanish-language world has produced and, at
the same time, a great humanist.''
   But the self-styled socialist and democrat has been heavily
criticized by the Mexican left and virtually ostacized by his peers
for his political views, which defy allegiance to either left or
right.
   He has chosen the life of political dissident in his country.
   Paz resigned from a 25-year diplomatic career to protest the
government's suppression of student demonstrations during the 1968
Olympic Games in Mexico City, and has since devoted himself to
writing and lecturing. He received an honorary doctorate from
Harvard University in 1980.
   The newest Nobel laureate is known in Mexico as a poet,
essayist, diplomat, critic, professor, translator, polemicist and
founder of literary journals.
   His poetry and essays cover concerns ranging from surrealism and
socialism to archaeology and Oriental philosophy. But above all,
Paz, 76, is immersed in his country's geography, climate and
mythology.
   ``Our history,'' writes Paz, ``has been a discontinuous process
of fits and starts: at times a dance, at others a lethargy
interrupted by a sudden, violent awakening.''
   ``Again and again, we Spanish and Spanish-Americans rub eyes and
ask: What time is it in world history? Our time never coincides
with other times. We are always either ahead or behind.''
   Among his best-known works are ``The Labyrinth of Solitude'' - a
classic analysis of the Mexican psyche - and his long, sensuous
poems ``Sun Stone'' and ``Blanca.''
   Critics have said his writing expresses Paz's sense of the deep
loneliness of man, which can be transcended only through attempts
at communion, sexual love, compassion and faith.
   Paz describes poetry as ``the memory of a country,'' and says
poets must be critics of their times.
   And the giant of Mexican letters has never shunned controversy.
His essays have angered both the left and the right.
   He miffed the leftist literati by equating President Fidel
Castro of Cuba with former Chilean strongman Augusto Pinochet and
dismissing the 1979 leftist revolution in Nicaragua as
``inconsequential.''
   ``I am an interlocutor who is hated and read by the left,'' he
once said.
   At the same time, he has frequently denounced the Institutional
Revolutionary Party - which has ruled Mexico for 61 years - as
corrupt and out of touch with the people it was formed to help.
   Paz was born in Mexico City on March 31, 1914 into what he has
described as a ``typical Mexican family.'' His mother's relatives
emigrated from Andalusia in Spain and his father's ancestors were
Mexicans of Indian descent.
   His paternal grandfather was a writer, journalist and political
activist who espoused the cause of the peasantry. It was in his
vast private library that the young Paz first read extensively.
   His father, a lawyer, embraced the Mexican revolution of 1910
and was an ardent supporter of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano
Zapata. The young writer was active in Marxist movements at the
University of Mexico.
   But Paz's family was ruined during the upheavals of the civil
war and he spent his boyhood in a suburb of Mexico City in a large
house that was, he once said, ``crumbling to bits.''
   ``As rooms collapsed,'' he recalled in Rita Guibert's 1973 book,
``Seven Voices,'' ``we moved the furniture into others.'' He lived
for a time in a large room with only part of a wall.
   At 17, Paz founded the avant-garde literary journal,
``Barrandal,'' and at 19 published his first book of poetry,
``Forest Moon.''
   He went to Spain for a year during the Spanish Civil War and
took up the anti-Franco republican cause. He told Guibert that
Spain ``taught me the meaning of the word `fraternity.'''
   Paz used such experiences and the insights they gave him to
write the scores of essays and hundreds of poems that have helped
shape Mexico's idea of itself and the way in which it is perceived
abroad.
   For this work, he on Thursday won one of the world's top prizes
for a writer, the Nobel Prize for literature.

   Octavio Paz said he would rather die than stop
writing poetry, which has unlocked doors to travel and diplomacy
and on Thursday brought him the Nobel Prize in literature.
   The 76-year-old Mexican author said he was in a Manhattan hotel
room ``sleeping peacefully'' when the phone rang with the news from
Sweden.
   ``I was very, very surprised,'' he told reporters. ``The prize
means a great lot, not in the sense it's a passport to immortality.
But it gives you the possibility of a wider audience. Even the most
expert writer needs an audience.''
   Paz, a former ambassador to India, is no stranger to praise. In
1981, he received the most important award in the Spanish-speaking
world, the Cervantes prize. In 1982, he captured the prestigious
American Neustadt Prize.
   ``Poetry is not a very popular art form these days, but it's an
essential part of human life,'' Paz said. ``Poetry is the memory of
a country, of language. Without poetry, people can't even talk
well.''
   ``I don't want to retire until I'm dead,'' he said.
   Paz, in New York for a Mexican art exhibit at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, answered questions in Spanish, French and English
from journalists from around the world.
   He spoke energetically behind a podium, his thick eyebrows and
full head of hair giving him a youthful presence. His blue eyes
calmly moved about the room, settling on each person he answered.
   Reflecting on his 25 years as a diplomat, he said poets must be
critics of society. He said the current century, with its two world
wars, concentration camps and the atomic bomb, had been ``very
cruel.''
   Paz resigned his job as ambassador to protest his government's
suppression of student demonstrations at the 1968 Olympic Games in
Mexico City.
   ``It has been a terrble century,'' said Paz. ``But we have had
great moments. Many poets have died in concentration camps.
   ``Now, we are seeing the coming back of freedom all over the
world and that is important. Art and also the great change of the
world has given me great pleasure,'' he said.
   He also reflected on years as a writer.
   ``We are born alone and the first thing is to be with others. I
have to communicate this thirst of communion. Language is a common
property. A writer is only the guardian of language, a collective
wealth,'' said Paz.
   ``My only job,'' he said, ``was to write the best I could.''

<HEAD>GOP Lawmakers Feel `Party of the Rich' Label in Tax Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Republicans who vowed to fight
any effort to raise income taxes are having second thoughts,
fearing they're being tarred as the protectors of the rich.
   ``I think we made a mistake, this party made a mistake taking
... this blood oath'' against tax rate increases, said Fred Grandy,
R-Iowa, who took it himself.
   ``I'm sick and tired of going home to rural Wisconsin and
protecting a Republican image as the party of the rich,'' added
Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis. ``And I don't do it.''
   Gunderson is among the majority of House Republicans who only a
few months ago pledged in writing not to touch top tax rates. Now,
in the 11th hour of crafting a five-year, $500 billion deficit
reduction plan, those tax changes seem more acceptable than some
alternatives such as a boost in the tax on gasoline.
   Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, the House Republican research
chairman, took the House floor on Thursday to announce his view:
``Republicans stand for cutting the gas tax.'' One of the most
vocal opponents of touching tax rates in the past, he repeated the
gas tax assertion four times - and never once mentioned the income
tax rate.
   Adding to the Republican problem is the confusion over just
where President Bush and the congressional Republicans stand on the
issue. Bush, famous for his ``read my lips'' pledge not to raise
taxes, was out in front of most of his party's leaders in dropping
that promise.
   And on Thursday the president said he could trade a modest
increase in income taxes on the wealthiest Americans for a deep cut
in capital gains rates.
   Republicans may have reason to worry about public perceptions.
   A recent national poll by the Times Mirror news organization
indicated that since Bush took office more and more Americans
consider the Republican party the party of the rich.
   Asked, ``What does it mean to be a Republican,'' 51 percent
volunteered that Republicans were allied with ``rich, powerful
moneyed interests.'' In 1987, only 21 percent gave that answer.
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the GOP's Senate campaign
effort this year, said the portrayal was unfair but he acknowledged
the issue was hurting.
   ``I think so far the Democrats have been pretty successful in
demagoguing the issue. They're taking advantage of it,'' he said.
   Nickles said Republicans now might support what he called
``making the tax rates more understandable,'' that is, making the
marginal tax rates on the wealthy match those of the upper middle
class, but without a net increase in revenue.
   House GOP leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said he was struggling with
other GOP lawmakers to come up with a Republican alternative
budget.
   He said his ranks were divided on whether to exchange a rate
increase on the wealthy for a capital gains tax cut in line with
Bush's position. But the House Republican Policy Committee on
Wednesday included in its budget proposal a plan to raise the top
tax rate on the wealthy to 31 percent in exchange for cutting the
rate on capital gains to 15 percent.
   ``Phony populism,'' is how House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., portrays the latest GOP effort.
   Democrats have insisted on rates of at least 20 percent on
capital gains and 32 percent on the upper incomes in an effort to
prevent what they call another tax break for the rich.
   ``Quite frankly, the price is still too high,'' Michel said.
   But for a growing number in his party, Michel said, raising
taxes on the rich was an attractive alternative to raising gasoline
taxes, cutting Medicare, or other features in the budget deal now
working its way through Congress.
   ``There are some who are really worried about the rich man
versus poor man argument (who would) without too much prodding go
to 33 percent,'' he said.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., the chairman of the policy
committee, denied his group's plan was in reaction to the polls or
Democratic rhetoric.
   ``We have never ... been a party that was sympathetic to the
higher incomes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Police Officer Says None of Air Crash Victims Survived Long</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUMFRIES, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police officer on Thursday told a
public inquiry into the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that
none of the 270 victims survived for any length of time.
   Sgt. David Johnston made the comment during cross-examination as
he continued the roll call of victims, detailing the cause of death
and where their bodies were found, if they were found.
   Johnston told Brian Gill, attorney for the relatives of British
victims, ``It soon became apparent that no person had survived for
any length of time'' in the Dec. 21, 1988 crash.
   Later, Johnston continued a roll call on the victims that began
on Wednesday.
   The occupation of one victim was listed in court papers as a
``Nazi hunter,'' but this description was not given in court.
Attorney Michael Bernstein, 36, of Bethesda, Md., had been
traveling from Vienna and London to New York on the night of the
disaster.
   Johnston told the hearing the dead man was an employee of the
U.S. Department of Justice, but gave no details. His body was found
on open ground near Lockerbie.
   The inquiry also heard that the body of student Nicole
Boulanger, 21, from Shrewsbury, Mass., was never found. But
investigators identified her from personal belongings strewn around
the area - her passport, found at Langholm, 18 miles away, and her
London Transport photocard.
   A Pan Am stewardess, who one witness thought had briefly
survived the crash, may have been Noelle Berti, 40, of Paris.
Johnston told the hearing her body was found near the cockpit and
was identified by fingerprints, dental records and jewelry.
   Mary Young, who trained as a nurse, said she found a pulse on a
young woman near the cockpit wreckage shortly after the crash, but
it was gone 10 minutes later.
   The inquiry is focusing on the causes of death and airport
security, but not criminal responsibility. Scottish police say they
are investigating several radical Palestinian groups.
   Police have said the bomb was planted in a radiocassette
recorder placed in a suitcase. The flight originated in Frankfurt
on a Boeing 727 and transferred to a larger 747 at London's
Heathrow Airport.

   Lola Perpich has taken an unusually high
profile in her husband's Democratic gubernatorial re-election
campaign, appearing in 30-second ads saying everything is rosy
under the Perpich administration.
   The current ad shows a vase of white roses, with hands from an
unseen person inserting a rose into the vase as a narrator tickets
off awards and distinctions to Minnesota.
   The ad closes with a shot of Lola Perpich suggesting that
Minnesota's high quality of life and well-managed government has
come about because ``Rudy makes government work for you.'' There's
a small picture of the governor in the corner.
   The ``Roses'' ads are part of a double-barrelled attack against

   In previous races for the Texas Railroad
Commission, John Sharp has beaten opponents Sam Ervin and Jack
Daniel.
   Now in his bid for state comptroller, Democrat Sharp is being
challenged by Republican Warren G. Harding Jr. That was the name of
a former Texas treasurer as well as the late president.
   Sharp says he is worried about his latest campaign against yet
another election-year rival with a celebrated name.
   ``Whenever a famous name is taken for granted, they win,'' Sharp
told a news conference.
   The Ervin in Sharp's race was not the famous Watergate senator
and Daniel had no connection to the Tennessee whiskey.
   Among the other names on the ballot in Texas this year.
   Gene Kelly is trying to win a seat on the Texas Supreme Court.
Sam Houston Clinton is seeking re-election to the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals.
   Voters in San Antonio could elect Bart Simpson - a young
businessman and not the sharp-tongued cartoon character - to the
Texas Legislature.
   Two write-in candidates for governor hope to take advantage of

speaker. Writer Lloyd ``Alamo'' Scott hopes voters will Remember

<HEAD>Spectators Demand `Unification' During First Inter-Korean Sports
Match</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of spectators cheered wildly
Thursday for North and South Korean soccer teams at the first
inter-Korean sports match in more than four decades, news reports
said.
   The crowd in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, chanted
``unification!'' as the two teams entered the stadium holding
hands, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.
   ``Waves of excitement and feelings of unity swept spectators,''
the agency said.
   The report said about 150,000 North Korean spectators waved
flags and hoisted huge placards that read ``Korea is one.'' Many
sang the ``Song of Unification,'' a sad and haunting melody known
to all Koreans, as 200 musicians played.
   South Korea's sports minister, Chung Dong-sung, received seven
standing ovations when he called for an exchange of civilians
across the heavily armed border as a step toward uniting the two
countries, Yonhap said. North and South Korea have been divided
since 1945.
   ``I hope this game will be an event that heals the pains of the
past and expedites unity and unification,'' Yonhap quoted Kim Yu
Sun, chairman of the North Korean Olympic Committee, as saying.
   North Korea's team beat South Korea, 2-1. Rules had been changed
to allow unlimited substitutions so that more players could
participate.
   North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo, gave a similar account.
   At the end of the game, players on both sides bowed to cheering
spectators and exchanged their sweat-soaked shirts as an electric
scoreboard flashed ``Our country is one,'' the South Korean reports
said.
   It was the first exchange of sports teams between North Korea
and South Korea since partition, and was only the second civilian
exchange between the two hostile Koreas. North Korean soccer
players are to visit Seoul later this month.
   The exchanges are seen as an indication of increased dialogue
between the two Koreas. More than 10 million Koreans were separated
from their families by the division of the peninsula and by the
three-year Korean War in the early 1950s.
   The border between the Koreas remains tightly sealed and guarded
by more than 1.5 million troops.
   Next week, the prime ministers of the two nations are to meet in
Pyongyang for a second round of talks on easing tensions.

<HEAD>West African Task Force Wins Control of Monrovia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West African soldiers using tanks
and jet bombers have won control of the capital of Liberia from
Charles Taylor's rebels, the army commander said Thursday.
   It cleared the way for an interim government and the arrival of
desperately needed food supplies in Monrovia.
   The five-nation army sent on Aug. 5 to stop Liberia's civil war
has forced the rebels back into Monrovia's eastern suburb of
Paynesville in fighting this week, Brig. Gen. Joshua Dogonyaro of
Nigeria said.
   Diplomats in Abidjan said reports reaching them by radio from
Monrovia backed Dogonyaro's statement.
   Rival rebel leader Prince Johnson pulled his fighters from
central Monrovia this week at Dogonyaro's request. A third force in
Monrovia, the remnants of the army of slain President Samuel Doe,
was holed up in and around the presidential mansion.
   Some Doe soldiers were fighting alongside the West Africans,
diplomats in Abidjan reported Thursday.
   The war began with Taylor's rebel forces invading from Ivory
Coast last December to oust a Doe government they called corrupt.
In February, Johnson split from the Taylor forces and brought his
fighters with him.
   The Economic Community of West African States, which sent the
multinational army, renewed an appeal for emergency food for people
starving in Monrovia, a city of 400,000. Executive Secretary Abbas
Bundu said Dogonyaro assured him the port was safe for ships and
that posts were set up for an orderly distribution of food.
   U.S. and other food aid has been held up in countries
neighboring Liberia, a West African nation of 2.5 million people
founded in 1847 by freed American slaves. The U.S. Ambassador in
Monrovia, Peter de Vos, has said U.S. food would not be brought in
until relief workers' safety was guaranteed and food could be
distributed without causing a riot, as happened previously.
   Nigerian ships this week carried the first substantial food
shipment to reach Monrovia in three months - 150 tons from the U.N.
World Food Program.
   The diplomats in Abidjan confirmed that the West Africans
captured Spriggs Payne Airfield, a few miles from downtown
Monrovia, but said the airport could not be used safely unless the
rebels are pushed back at least 10 miles.
   Diplomats said Ghanaian troops and some Liberian army soldiers
went into the German Embassy neighboring Paynesville on Wednesday.
They said they were conducting a house-to-house search for rebels,
but the Liberians started looting, the diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The only German who remains there along with hundreds of
refugees called diplomats by radio. They contacted the West African
force headquarters, and officers were dispatched who ordered the
troops from the embassy, the diplomats said.
   Other countries that have sent soldiers are Nigeria, Guinea,
Gambia and Sierra Leone.
   West Africans sent the army to force a cease-fire to allow the
installation of an interim government chosen by exiled Liberians.
Elections will follow.
   Taylor has named his own government and says the temporary
administration, presently based in neighbrring Sierra Leone, is a
stooge of the West Africans.
   More than 5,000 civilians have been killed in the war, and half
a million Liberians have fled to neighboring states or are
displaced within the country.
   Task force nations said the impact of Liberia's civil war on
surrounding nations made their action imperative.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked a U.S. Marine
residence, killing a Bolivian policeman, and set off a bomb that
destroyed a monument to President John F. Kennedy, officials said
Thursday.
   A group calling itself the Nestor Paz Zamora Commando claimed
responsibility for Wednesday night's attacks in calls to a Roman
Catholic radio station.
   Two men, one dressed in army fatigues, got out of a car in front
of the Marine residence and opened fire with machine guns, said
U.S. Embassy spokesman Bruce Wharton. The two police guarding the
residence were injured, and one of them died on the way to the
hospital, Wharton said.
   The gunmen tossed a package bomb at the door of the building,
destroying the door and causing the front of the building to tilt.
The three Marines inside were not hurt, Wharton said.
   ``We very much regret the death of the Bolivian police and are
taking the attacks very seriously,'' Wharton said.
   At midnight, a powerful bomb went off at the Kennedy statue in
central La Paz, a city 2{ miles high in the Andes in this
landlocked South American country. Several people near the statue
suffered slight injuries.
   The guerrillas said the attacks were ``a response to the
violation of our territoral and political sovereignty by
imperialists from the North.'' Their statement denied a link to
drug smugglers. ``As revolutionaries, our struggle is based on the
highest ethical standards. No more yankees, no more drugs.''
   The group takes its name from the late brother of Bolivia's
current president, Jaime Paz Zamora. Nestor Paz Zamora launched an
unsuccessful guerrilla movement in Bolivia in 1970, the year before
his brother founded the Revolutionary Left Movement, currently the
governing party.
   Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco said the attacks were
``attempting to bury a democratic process that cost the Bolivian
people a great deal of sacrifice.''
   Only last week Capobianco had called Bolivia ``an island of
tranquility.'' Over the past decade Bolivia has been largely spared
the violence of drug smugglers and political extremists that has
wracked Peru and Colombia, fellow Andean nations.
   The attacks came a week after the government denounced an
alleged plot by cocaine traffickers to assassinate U.S. Ambassador
Robert S. Gelbard, President Paz Zamora and other officials.
   In May 1989, two Mormon missionaries were slain in La Paz by a
leftist terrorist group called Zarate Wilka. Several members of the
group are in jail awaiting trial, but the triggermen were believed
still at large.
   Zarate Wilka also claimed responsibility for the August 1988
bombing near the motorcade of then-Secretary of State George P.
Shultz. It caused no injuries.

<TEXT>
   The first testimony at a hunter's
manslaughter trial Thursday was a tape recording of his horror at
shooting a woman he said he thought was a deer.
   ``When I got there, she was laying on the ground and I lost it
right there,'' Donald Rogerson told a game warden, who recorded
their conversation about one hour after Karen Wood was killed Nov.
15, 1988.
   ``All I could think of was `I just don't want her to die,' ''
Rogerson said on the tape, his voice trembling.
   Rogerson, 47, the manager of a supermarket produce section, is
on trial in Penobscot County Superior Court. His case has touched
off renewed debate about hunting safety and drawn national
attention.
   Rogerson, who lives in Bangor, said he had been hunting in the
woods behind Mrs. Wood's suburban Hermon home for some time the day
of the killing and didn't realize how near he was to her home.
   ``I couldn't see the house at all,'' he said. ``At no time did I
ever see a person.''
   Rogerson said he had been following a deer, fired one and
missed. Then, he said, he thought he saw ``two flags,'' the white
underside of a deer's tail. He fired again.
   Rogerson said on the tape he was horrified when he found Mrs.
Wood lying on the ground and realized he must have mistaken her
white mittens for a deer's tail.
   After trying to carry Mrs. Wood to her home, he placed her on
the ground. ``I just laid down on the ground next to her and kept
her covered,'' Rogerson said on the tape.
   Before the taped conversation was played, the prosecution and
defense attorneys offered conflicting assessments about the
abundance of deer in the area where Rogerson shot the 37-year-old
mother of twin year-old girls.
   Jeffrey Hjelm, the assistant attorney general prosecuting the
case, said in his opening remarks that wardens examined the area of
the shooting and found only one deer track. He said that track was
behind where Rogerson fired the fatal shot.
   Defense attorney Lewis Vafiades countered that two other hunters
who had been with Rogerson before the shooting had spotted several
deer in that area earlier in the day.
   The prosecution contends Rogerson acted negligently or
recklessly when he killed Mrs. Wood, who was about 130 feet behind
her house.
   Mrs. Wood's husband, Kevin, who now lives in Bettendorf, Iowa,
said he didn't think a conviction would help heal emotional scars
because ``there are no winners in this situation.''
   Hours after the shooting, Rogerson was charged with
manslaughter. But the charge was dropped in December 1988 after a
county grand jury concluded his actions were neither criminally
negligent nor criminally reckless.
   The state attorney general's office reopened the case after a
Portland television station reported that Vafiades' nephew had
served on the first grand jury. A special grand jury indicted
Rogerson on manslaughter charges in December 1989.

<TEXT>
   Physicians at a conference on suicide warned
Thursday that an economic downturn could spark a dramatic increase
in adult suicides.
   If recession is defined as nine months of rising unemployment,
``the correlation is extremely strong between the vicissitudes of
the economy and actual suicide,'' said Dr. Andrew Slaby, president
of the eastern division of the American Suicide Foundation.
   Slaby spoke at a news briefing before the foundation's one-day
conference at a midtown hotel on preventing, evaluating and
managing suicidal behavior.
   About 1,500 physicians, therapists, psychologists and social
workers from a three-state area registered for the gathering,
described by organizers as the largest of its kind in the United
States.
   Slaby, psychiatrist in chief at The Regent Hospital in
Manhattan, said studies on suicide rates during the Depression
found suicides increased most ``among white, successful males and
black women, the two that really suffered the most when they lost
jobs.''
   In times of economic hardship, he said, black women were often
among the first to lose jobs. He noted that domestic workers relied
for employment on affluent white men who had lost jobs themselves.
   Dr. Herbert Hendin, the American Suicide Foundation's executive
director, said there are no figures measuring the effect of the
current economic downturn on the suicide rate. But he said
throughout the century, the suicide rate went up when the economy
declined.
   In September, the nation's unemployment rose to 5.7 percent. It
was the first time since the 1981-82 recession that the jobless
rate increased three months in a row.
   Slaby also noted the suicide rate generally has declined during
war times. The 19th century French sociologist Emile Durkheim found
there were fewer suicides during the great wars in Europe in the
19th century.
   The U.S. suicide rate rose during World War I, World War II and
the Korean War but not during the Vietnam War, Slaby said.
   People feel less desperation when they ``bond together and fight
for a common cause,'' he said.
   The American Suicide Foundation said 30,796 people - 24,272 men
and 6,524 women - committed suicide in the United States in 1987.
Although more men commit suicide, more women attempt suicide, it
said.
   Because men use ``more violent means'' to kill themselves than
women, they are more likely to succeed, Slaby said. Women are more
likely to seek counseling or help from peers, he said.
   But Slaby noted that the suicide rate among professional women
is rapidly increasing.
   Among 15 to 24 year olds, suicide is the second leading cause of
death after accidents, according to the foundation.
   The foundation was formed two years ago and funds research at
major medical centers in the treatment and prevention of depression
and suicide.

<HEAD>Corn Crop To Hit Four-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite some losses to dry weather, farmers
are still harvesting a bumper corn crop estimated at a four-year
high of 8.02 billion bushels, up 7 percent from last year, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   However, the new estimate by the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board was down 1 percent from last month's forecast of
8.12 billion bushels.
   ``Early in September, lack of moisture in the western Corn Belt
caused deteriorating crop conditions,'' the board's report said.
``Crop conditions lagged furthest behind in Illinois, Indiana and
Missouri.''
   Farmers harvested 7.53 billion bushels in 1989, and the
department in its initial 1990 forecast on Aug. 9 put this fall's
harvest at 7.85 billion bushels before raising it last month.
   John A. Schnittker of Schnittker Associates, a Washington-based
consulting firm, said the forecast is ``almost equal to the amount
of corn we will need in the next 12 months'' to meet domestic and
export demands now projected.
   But the bad news, he said, is that ``this corn crop coincides
with a glut in wheat, especially.'' Big wheat producers, including
the United States, are subsidizing exports in an effort to unload
surpluses.
   ``The big wheat crop glutting the world market and the
subsidization of wheat, pushing it below corn prices, is the real
problem,'' Schnittker said.
   Based on Oct. 1 surveys, corn yields were estimated at a record
120.3 bushels per acre harvested, compared with 116.2 last year and
121.7 indicated last month. The old record was 119.4 bushels in
1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 5.8 percent in
1989, the sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981, are expected
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent in 1990.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.82 billion bushels, down 5 percent from
last year's harvest of 1.93 billion bushels and 1 percent below the
September forecast of 1.83 billion bushels.
   Cotton production was indicated at 14.5 million bales, up 19
percent from last year's output of 12.2 million bales but down 1
percent from the September forecast.
   The revised estimates showed total wheat production at 2.74
billion bushels, up 35 percent from the 1989 harvest but down
slightly from last month.
   The department's all-crops production index was reported at 111
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison, down one
percentage point from September but still the highest reading since
the index averaged 116 percent in 1985.
   In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities,
analysts said total corn use in the 1990-91 marketing year that
began on Sept. 1 is expected to be about 8.095 billion bushels,
including domestic and export requirements.
   With demand slightly exceeding 1990 corn production, that will
mean a decrease in U.S. corn stockpiles to about 1.273 billion
bushels left over by Sept. 1, 1991.
   But the downturn would be modest compared with 1989 when the
corn stockpile plummeted from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988
to 1.93 billion bushels on hand last Sept. 1.
   The report sid U.S. corn prices may average in the range of
$2.20 to $2.60 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, up 10
cents from the September projection. Corn prices at the farm
averaged about $2.36 per bushel last season.
   No significant changes were reported in the U.S. wheat supply
and demand situation, and prices at the farm are expected to
average $2.55 to $2.85 per bushel this marketing year, down from
$3.72 in 1989-90.
   Soybean prices at the farm were forecast at $5.70 to $7 per
bushel in 1990-91, compared with $5.70 the past marketing year.
That was up 20 cents on the lower end of the range in September.
   Other 1990 crop estimates based on Oct. 1 indications, compared
with 1989 output, included:
   -Sorghum, 561.9 million bushels and an average yield of 60.7
bushels per acre, compared with 617.9 million and 55.4 in 1989.
   -Rice, 158 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,629 pounds per
acre, compared with 154.5 million and 5,749.
   -Peanuts, 3.36 billion pounds and a yield of 1,917 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.99 billion and 2,426.
   -Tobacco, 1.58 billion pounds and a yield of 2,166 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,016.
   -Sugar beets, 27.1 million tons and a yield of 19.89 tons per
acre, compared with 25.1 million and 19.4.
   -Sugar cane, 25.7 million tons and a yield of 35.7 tons per
acre, compared with 29.4 million and 34.5.

<HEAD>Soviets Harvesting Near-Record Grain Crop, US Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is harvesting a near-record
grain crop estimated at 235 million metric tons, up 5 million tons
from previous forecasts, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Officials said the increase in grain prospects was based
primarily on harvest reports from the Soviet Union.
   The estimate of wheat production was raised 4 million tons to
108 million tons, while coarse grains such as rye, barley, oats,
corn, sorghum and millet, were increase by 1 million tons to 114
million tons.
   Production of pulses, rice, buckwheat and miscellaneous grains
account for the remainder.
   The monthly report by the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service said Soviet grain imports in the 1990-91 marketing year
that began July 1 continue to be estimated at 30 million tons, down
from 38 million last year.
   Moscow's grain buying ``continues relatively subdued,'' the
report said. Prospects for this year's bumper grain crop and
uncertainty caused by economic and political reforms were cited
among the reasons.

   The Persian Gulf crisis has unleashed
forces seeking political reforms in the feudal gulf states,
including an extraordinary effort to discuss the future of Kuwait
if it is freed from Iraqi occupation.
   Kuwait's exiled rulers have invited 450 prominent citizens to a
conference in Saudi Arabia this weekend to consider the future
shape of a free Kuwait.
   The government is eagerly - and uncharacteristically -
soliciting the attendance of the Western press at the event.
   Crown Prince Sheik Saad al Abdullah made it clear that the
agenda will range from future defense arrangments to the rights of
Kuwaiti citizens and foreign workers.

   ROME (AP) - Every morning, 90 Iraqi sailors hoist the flag on
their two Esmeraldas-class corvettes, rev their engines and swivel
their 76-millimeter cannons menacingly along the horizon.
   It is a scene that would worry the U.S. military - if it were
not taking place on the sunny Italian Riviera.
   The two corvettes, and eight other warships floating nearby,
were ordered from Italy in 1980. They were to have formed the bulk
of Iraq's most powerful naval fleet ever.
   But as Saddam Hussein's country prepares for war, its would-be
navy is stranded at an Italian military base and a nearby
shipbuilder's docks, a victim of delays and Italian government
embargoes.
   ``It will be very difficult for these ships to ever arrive in
Iraq,'' said Marco Maria Ferranti, spokesman for the Italian
shipbuilder, Fincantieri.

   JERUSALEM (AP) - Police fired tear gas in Jerusalem's Old City
on Thursday to break up a march by about 150 Palestinians to the
Temple Mount, where police killed 19 Arabs earlier this week.
   The government and Israel's chief rabbis called on Israelis to
come to the Western Wall by the thousands Thursday night to
reassert control over Judaism's holiest site.
   In New York City, the U.N. Security Council held consultations
to end the stalemate over criticism of the violence in Jerusalem.
But a vote was not expected Thursday.
   Thousands of fundamentalist Moslems demonstrated in neighboring
Jordan and pledged to avenge Monday's killings, which occurred when
police opened fire on rioters stoning Jews praying at the Western
Wall below.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The House moved toward a vote Thursday on a
bill that would scrap explicit anti-obscenity curbs on the National
Endowment for the Arts and instead penalize grant recipients later
convicted of violating obscenity laws.
   Supporters predicted passage of the measure after months of
controversy over public financing of art considered offensive by
some.
   Conservatives led by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., fought to
muster opposition to the bipartisan compromise bill that would
extend the NEA's statutory authority for three years, without any
restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for federal subsidies.
   The Williams-Coleman bill would drop the detailed anti-obscenity
restrictions that Congress imposed on the NEA a year ago at the
urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.. The measure would shift from
the endowment to the courts the burden of deciding whether
NEA-supported works are obscene.

   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Octavio Paz, who explored the Mexican
character and the universal themes of love, death and loneliness in
lyrical poetry and impassioned essays, won the Nobel Prize in
literature Thursday.
   The Swedish Academy awarded Paz the prize for his ``exquisite
love poetry, at the same time sensuous and visual,'' and for his
wide international perspective.
   It also cited Paz for his essays on Mexican society, calling him
``a lodestar in the tide of opinion.'' Paz's views have angered the
left and the right in his homeland, and he was dumped by leftists
who felt he turned on their cause.
   Paz, 76, said he was ``very, very surprised'' at being selected.
   ``Poetry is not a very popular art form these days, but it's an
essential part of human life,'' Paz said in New York, where he is
inaugurating a Mexican art exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. ``Poetry is the memory of a country, of language.''

   MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviet Union's most advanced booster rocket,
which an American specialist believed was carrying a spy satellite,
exploded seconds after liftoff last week.
   The blast nearly destroyed the launch pad and may complicate
Soviet efforts to sell space hardware to the West.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported for the first time
Thursday that a Zenit booster ``broke up'' at the Baikonur space
port in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan on Oct. 4.
   Tass said no one was hurt and that a commission is investigating
the accident. The three-sentence dispatch did not identify the
payload or give any other details. It also did not say why the
explosion was not reported for a week.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A congressional report warns that shuttle
flights and other space activity could become too risky within the
next 20-30 years if nations continue to litter the most traveled
paths.
   Already, the Hubble Space Telescope - which has enough problems
of its own because of faulty optics - has been given a one-in-100
chance of being severely damaged by space debris during its 17-year
lifetime, said the Office of Technology Assessment.
   `Even small debris particles can produce high levels of
damage,'' said Ray Williamson, who directed the study. ``The
average collision velocity in low earth orbit is about 10
kilometers (6.2 miles) a second.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday
proposed seizing all Communist Party property without compensation,
highlighting the growing anger at Czechoslovakia's former rulers
during a time of economic hardship.
   The state news agency said the plan would be presented
immediately to parliament for approval.
   About 60,000 people jammed the Old Town Square in Prague late
Thursday in a show of support for the proposal.
   The CTK news agency said the expropriation plan would remove
property the Communist Party had ``gained in unjust ways, giving it
an advantage over other political parties and movements in
contradiction to democratic principles.''
   According to news reports, the Communist Party still controls
property worth about $368 million. Government spokesman Zbynek
Fiala said party assets totaled $793 million before
Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution late last year.
   But Communist Party secretary Jiri Machalik contested the
figures, saying on Thursday that much of the party's property had
already been handed over to the government. He said the remaining
assets were worth about $145 million.
   Machalik added the Communists had proposed an alternate proposal
that would allow the party to retain some property in Prague and
elsewhere.
   Party property includes buildings, communications equipment,
recreation centers, newspapers, and other assets.
   The government began a gradual transfer of property away from
the Communists in May when it froze party assets. But as economic
difficulties heighten in the central European country, many people
now consider that insufficient.
   Anti-Communist sentiment has been growing steadily in
Czechoslovakia. Government officials said last month the party had
lost more than a million members, or about half its adherents, in
the 10 months since the revolution.
   Anger deepened following reports Sunday that Communist Party
leader Vasil Mohorita had criticized the country's economic reforms
and urged disbanded Communist Party committees at work places be
re-establishd.
   The comments were seen by many as a way of making political
gains out of Czechoslovakia's economic troubles. The Soviet Union
has fallen short of its targets for oil deliveries, and the
government last week announced higher prices for heating oil and
gasoline.
   The crowd jamming Prague's Old Town Square on Thursday warned
they would not tolerate any attempt by the Communists to regain
control of the country.
   ``We do not want political trials, we do not want to see
Communists in jail, we just want them to go,'' said Milan Dolejsi,
63, of Czechoslovakia's confederation of political prisoners.
   But many of the younger participants were more radically
inclined. Miroslav Kulhavy of the Greens Party demanded prosecution
of former President Gustav Husak and other party leaders.

<TEXT>
   Portugal is negotiating the country's
first official visit to the tiny island of East Timor since
Indonesia annexed the territory in 1976, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Thursday.
   The spokesman said Portugal and Indonesia held their fourth
round of U.N.-sponsored talks in August. A new round of talks was
expected before the end of the year, he said.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the visit by
Portuguese lawmakers could occur next year.
   Meanwhile, there were new reports of repression in the former
Portuguese colony.
   According to Portuguese news reports, Indonesia reinforced
security measures this week in East Timor's capital, Dili, after
unidentified masked groups attacked students demonstrating in favor
of independence.
   There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
   A human rights group in Jakarta has asked the military to
explain the deaths of 22 people in the East Timor village of Poros
Posparlos on Aug. 19. H.J.B. Princen, director of the Institute for
the Defense of Human Rights, declined in an interview to discuss
the specifics of the deaths. Diplomatic sources said there were
riots in the area around that time.
   Brig. Gen. Nurhadi Purwosaputro, head of the Armed Forces
Information Center, said Princen's claims were ``groundless.''
   ``The Indonesian soldiers have moral sense that prevents them
from doing such inhuman things,'' he said.
   Portugal has tried to enlist international support for its
demand that East Timor be granted self-determination. The island
350 miles north of Australia was invaded by Indonesian troops in
1975 and annexed a year later.
   A guerrilla war has been going on since then. Rights groups
estimate 100,000 Timorese have been killed or starved to death.
   Alatas, in Jakarta, said Wednesday that the Portuguese would be
accompanied by a U.N. delegation ``to make sure that the evaluation
is objective.''
   A 1982 United Nations resolution empowers the U.N. Secretary
General to mediate between Indonesia and Portugal over the East
Timor question.

   Actor Hume Cronyn used a personal plea to
convince zoning officials that he and his wife, actress Jessica
Tandy, needed a waiver to build an apartment for an attendant.
   ``Old age is a hardship,'' Cronyn told the Zoning Board of
Appeals. ``One that you'll be dealing with over the years.''
   Miss Tandy, 81, and Cronyn, 79, had been denied a zoning waiver
in August to build the apartment, which they said they might need
for a driver or attendant. But the board approved the request
Tuesday after Cronyn said the problem had become more urgent.
   Miss Tandy, who won an Oscar for her role as an elderly woman

hospitalized for a heart condition following surgery, Cronyn said.
   He did not reveal the nature of her surgery.

   Britain's foreign secretary warned Thursday the world will
revert to anarchy if the international coalition against Iraq
collapses, and said Saddam Hussein must be told force will be used
if Iraq doesn't withdraw from Kuwait.
   The Air Force, meanwhile, grounded all training flights in the
Persian Gulf region for 24 hours from midday Wednesday until midday
Thursday to discuss air safety with pilots. The order followed
separate accidents this week in which 12 U.S. servicemen died.
   A group of 321 Western evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait landed in
Britain on Thursday in the first such flight in nearly three weeks.
Most of the passengers were Americans and many were children.
   The Americans and Canadians on the flight were to leave Friday
for Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, said
Andrew Varney, Gatwick airport's director of public affairs.
   While Westerners continued to flee occupied Kuwait with tales of
low food supplies and looting by Iraqi troops, international
pressure grew against Saddam to withdraw from the oil-rich emirate
he invaded and annexed.
   Speaking at the annual conference of the governing Conservative
Party in Bournemouth, England, British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd urged the world to remain united against iraq's occupation.
   ``If it does not (hold), then despite the coalition, despite the
leadership of the United States, despite the cooperation of the
Soviet Union - then we shall be back in a world of anarchy
punctuated by explosions of force,'' Hurd said.
   ``The clouds would have extinguished the light. We cannot allow
this to happen.''
   Hurd also said Saddam should know that force will be used if
Iraq does not pull out of Kuwait, which his troops invaded on Aug.
2.
   ``Day by day we must build in the minds of the Iraqis the
certainty that they have to leave Kuwait - if not peacefully, then
forced out by military action,'' Hurd said.
   Monday's killing by Israeli police of 19 Arabs during a riot in
Jerusalem brought international outcry and united Arab nations
against Israel, a close ally of the United States. There was
concern that the israeli action might weaken Arab support for the
multinational military presence in the gulf.
   The U.N. Security Council is considering means of censuring
Israel that would satisfy outraged Arab nations and also Israel's
allies.
   Oil prices rose $1.73 a barrel in New York Thursday to close at
$40.43 on unfounded rumors that a Palestine terrorist group lobbed
missiles into the Israeli-occupied West Bank, land taken from the
Arabs in the 1967 war. Stocks in New York again fell, down 42.82
points to an 18-month low at 2,365.10.
   More than 170,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Saudi Arabia and
on warships in the gulf region, backed by vessels and soldiers from
other countries. Most nations, with few exceptions, have condemned
Iraq's aggression.
   The Air Force announced it had halted all training flights in
the gulf region but not reconnaissance missions and other
``operational patrols,'' said a second Pentagon spokesman, Col.
Miguel Monteverde.
   There are an estimated 700 Air Force combat and support aircraft
in the gulf region under Operation Desert Shield.
   ``The Air Force declared a flying standdown for one day to
conduct safety awareness meetings with Air Force pilots,'' Williams
said.
   He said the grounding was ``to get together with everybody and
just sort of review what they need to do to fly more safely.''
   The official death toll for Desert Shield rose to 24 on
Wednesday, when an Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed on a
training mission in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew members.
   On Monday, two pilots were killed in the crash of an Air Force
F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet in Saudi Arabia. Hours earlier, two
Marine Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters - each carrying four crew
members - crashed over the Arabian Sea. The eight men are listed as
missing.
   Williams said, however, that the military's safety record since
troops began to be deployed two months ago remained good under the
circumstances.
   ``Given the amount of flying that has to be done, given the
extraordinary circumstances and given the higher than ordinary
operating tempo in the area, I think our service people are doing
very well,'' he said.
   The freedom flight from Iraq and Kuwait arriving in London on
Thursday was the first since Sept. 22, and like previous flights,
carried mostly women and children and Western men of Arab origin.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
described as ``simply outrageous'' Iraqi treatment of the 270
Americans and foreign-born family members aboard the flight.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Iraqi authorities interrogated and harassed
the departing passengers forcing lengthy delays. Some evacuees said
they were threatened with weapons and a dozen people were prevented
from boarding the flight, she said.
   Until Thursday, freedom flights had transported about 1,900
Americans out of Iraq and Kuwait. Recent State Department estimates
indicated more than 600 Americans were stranded in Kuwait and more
than 300 in Iraq.
   American and other Western men are being held in Iraq and
Kuwait, many at strategic Iraqi installations to deter against any
possible attack.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Drift Net Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Thursday to ban the use of
large-scale drift nets in U.S. waters up to 200 miles offshore as
well as their use by domestic fishing fleets anywhere in the world.
   The nets - which can extend up to 40 miles - have been blamed
for the deaths of thousands of dolphins, other sea mammals and
birds caught in their paths as they float through the water to trap
tuna and other commercial fish.
   The U.S. ban, as well as language directing the Bush
administration to seek an international outlawing of drift net
fishing, was included in a bill approved 98-0 extending the
Magnuson Fishery and Conservation Act another five years.
   Named after the late Sen. Warren Magnuson, D-Wash., the 1976 law
established exclusive U.S. economic control over commercial and
sport fishing within 200 miles of the U.S. coastline.
   The bill extends that control to tuna, which had been exempted
from it in the past because they migrate over international
boundaries. Similar legislation was approved by the House last
February.
   The legislation also includes a provision by Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., that would require the development of government standards
that tuna canners would have to adopt in order to label their
product ``dolphin-safe.''
   In response to environmental campaigns and TV documentaries with
dramatic footage of water-breathing dolphins suffocating in tuna
drift nets when brought to the surface, Starkist last April began
publicizing its use of ``dolphin-safe'' practices and labeling
their cans as such.
   Biden said the labels have been ``abused and bastardized'' by
other tuna canners whose practices continue to result in dolphin
deaths in their fishing operations.

   The African National Congress
accused President F.W. de Klerk of negotiating in bad faith
Thursday and warned of a renewed armed struggle if peace talks
break down.
   De Klerk later denied the allegation before leaving for a visit
to Britain and Portugal. He said the ANC charge appeared timed to
coincide with his trip.
   A government minister, meanwhile, criticized an ANC leader's
statement that the organization was continuing to recruit fighters
for its suspended armed struggle.
   ANC spokesman Sakkie Macozoma told a news conference the
government reneged on an agreement to release only a joint
statement after Monday's meeting between de Klerk and ANC deputy
president Nelson Mandela.
   After the meeting, de Klerk also announced that ANC and other
political exiles could begin applying for permission to return to
South Africa. He said there were no guarantees indemnity from
prosecution would be granted.
   His statement addressed a key ANC demand, that the estimated
20,000 ANC exiles be permitted to come home.
   Macozoma said de Klerk's announcement pre-empted further work by
a government-ANC committee studying the issue.
   ``De Klerk and the government's undermining of efforts to
achieve a genuine peace settlement places the whole negotiations
process in jeopardy,'' Macozoma said.
   He distributed a document Mandela gave de Klerk at the meeting.
In it, Mandela warned the ANC would have no choice but to resume
its armed struggle if peace talks failed.
   The ANC suspended its armed struggle in August as a condition
for the talks on ending apartheid and setting up negotiations on
power-sharing between the white minority and black majority.
   ``It should be plainly understoood that if we ever, once again,
face a situation in which all constitutional avenues for an advance
to democracy are closed, we will have no option but to use other
methods,'' the Mandela document said. ``If this is war talk, then I
too plead guilty.''
   De Klerk told a hastily arranged airport news conference the ANC
statements would not derail negotiations.
   ``I hope that the leadership of the ANC will also refrain from
any act or statement which will unnecessarily endanger this and
will make sure of their facts before they make an attack on the
integrity of the government,'' he said.
   Gerrit Viljoen, the minister of constitutional development,
accused the ANC of violating its agreement to suspend the armed
struggle by continuing to recruit fighters. He was referring to
comments by Chris Hani, head of the ANC's armed wing, that
recruitment continued.
   In suspending its armed struggle, the ANC agreed to halt
``related activities,'' Viljoen told a news briefing.
   `` `Related activities' surely must include the recruitment of
people for training for armed action, and training and keeping them
in camps and having ammunition stores and so on,'' he said.
   Relations between the white-led government and the ANC, the
largest black opposition movement, have been strained by black
faction fighting that has killed about 800 people in two months.
   The fighting in black townships around Johannesburg has pitted
Xhosas and other blacks linked to the ANC against Zulu supporters
of the conservative Inkatha movement.
   Mandela and other black leaders accuse security forces of
instigating the clashes, perhaps at the behest of right-wing
extremists opposed to the government-ANC talks.
   His statement to de Klerk called for an independent judicial
inquiry into the violence and charges that Inkatha fighters were
trained by government forces.
   ``A reluctance to subject such widespread allegations to
impartial inquiry fuels a popular perception that there are forces
close to you, Mr. President, with a double agenda,'' the document
said.
   The government has denied the allegations and challenged the ANC
to provide proof.

   A bomb in a crowded
discoteque Thursday killed the Galician separatist who apparently
brought it in and two other people, a government spokeswoman said.
Forty-nine people were injured.
   The pre-dawn blast was one of six early Thursday in the
northwestern region of Galicia. The disco bomb was the only fatal
explosion and was apparently accidental, said spokeswoman Rosa
Conde.
   The other bombings were aimed at property owned by or linked to
cocaine smugglers, regional officials said. The separatists claimed
responsibility for the non-lethal bombs, said Pontevedra province
official Jorge Parada.
   Police found and defused a seventh bomb at a bank after
receiving a telephoned bomb threat from the separatists, he said.
More explosives were later found in a rented car parked near the
disco.
   The explosion destroyed the Clangor dance club and killed
Ignacio Villar Regueiro, the suspected member of the Exercito
Guerrilleiro de Pobo Galego Ceibe (The Guerrilla Army of the Free
Galician People), Conde said.
   Two women were killed. Eleven of those injured were hospitalized
in serious condition late Thursday, hospital spokesmen said.
   About 5,000 University of Santiago students marched silently
through the city, the capital of the region, to protest the disco
bombing, which injured some of their classmates.
   The separatist group, seeking independence for the four-province
region in northwest Spain, has claimed more than 50 attacks since
its first action in March 1986.
   It is the weakest of the three major separatist movements in
Spain - the others being the Basques in northeast Spain and the
Catalonians in the southeast.
   Although Galicians speak a separate tongue, closer to Portuguese
than Spanish, the notion of a separate state has attracted little
voter sympathy.
   The bombings against the traffickers, whose influence in Galicia
has grown notably in recent years, could be an attempt to rally
support for the separatists' goals, Parada suggested.
   The bombs destroyed or damaged a clothing boutique, a car
dealership, a canning factory, a bar and a bank branch, all in
Pontevedra province, Parada said.
   The targeted cocaine traffickers were among more than 30 people
jailed last June in a major anti-drug sweep, officials said.
   The smugglers have been adapting routes long used to move
contraband tobacco along Galicia's jagged coast to become major
distributors of cocaine in Europe.
   So far this year, narcotics agents have captured more than a ton
of Colombian cocaine in Galicia, almost a third of all the cocaine
seized last year in Spain.

<HEAD>FDA Demands Correction On Sunscreen Label</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has told a
sunscreen maker to stop claiming its products protect against a
broad spectrum of the sun's rays.
   In an Oct. 5 letter released Thursday, the FDA told
Schering-Plough Corp. officials to correct the labeling on
``Shade'' and any of its other sunscreen products by removing
references to protection against ultraviolet A rays.
   The UVA protection claim is unproven because there are no
generally recognized testing procedures for determining UVA
protection, the FDA said.
   Schering-Plough includes on the labels of its ``Shade'' products
the designation ``APP,'' the company's UVA protection factor
expressed as a percentage of the spectrum blocked by the
sunscreens.
   UVA rays are longer, less intense rays that are believed to
contribute to cancer, wrinkles and other skin damage.
   Ultraviolet B, or UVB, rays are the shorter, burning rays that
cause sunburn and some skin cancers. These rays can be measured and
are often expressed as a sun protection factor, or SPF.
   The agency gave the company 10 days after receipt of the letter
to advise the FDA what corrective measure had been taken.
Otherwise, the FDA said it was prepared to take the matter to
court.
   Lewis Nolan, a spokesman for Schering-Plough HealthCare
Products, said the company wants to meet with the FDA as soon as
possible to discuss the issue.
   ``The company believes that FDA questions over the type of
information communicated to consumers about UVA protection can be
resolved to the satisfaction of all parties,'' he said.
   In letters to several companies last February, the FDA warned
sunscreen makers that claims of UVA protection were
``unsubstantiated, and therefore, unacceptable.''
   UVA protection claims can give consumers a false sense of
security, the FDA said, because sunbathers who believe they are
adequately protected may stay out in the sun longer.
   The only company the FDA allows to make UVA protection claims is
Herbert Laboratories' Photoplex. The product contains a new
ingredient, which required it to undergo a more intensive
effectiveness review by the FDA.

   A police sergeant disguised as a
television cameraman rescued a 14-year-old salesgirl held hostage
for three hours on Wednesday by a thief pointing a gun at her head,
a police spokesman said.
   He gave this account:
   Marcelo de Jesus Bastos, 20, and a friend entered a downtown
sportswear store to steal tennis shoes, shorts and T-shirts.
   They panicked when police patrolling the area entered the store.
Bastos took salesgirl Luciana Silva Oliveira hostage and his friend
fled.
   Holding a gun to Miss Oliveira's head, Bastos walked out of the
store but was cornered by more than 50 police in front of a nearby
Pentecostal church.
   Police Sgt. Claudio Manoel Falcao de Figueiredo, disguised as a
TV cameraman, slowly approahed Bastos. Seeing that the gunman's
weapon was not cocked, he hurled the camera at him and grabbed the
pistol.
   Miss Oliveira was rescued unharmed.
   The spokesman spoke on condition of anonymity.

   President Bush said Thursday he will nominate
David A. Kessler, a lawyer-physician from New York City, to be
commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
   Kessler is medical director of the Albert Einstein medical
school in New York and teaches food and drug law at Columbia School
of Law.
   The top spot at FDA has been vacant since Frank Young resigned
under pressure nearly a year ago. James Benson has been acting FDA
commissioner.
   The FDA has the responsibility of regulating a wide range of
foods, drugs and cosmetics that account for about 25 cents of every
dollar spent on consumer products in the United States.
   Kessler was a consultant to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for
several years in the early 1980s.
   He is a member of an advisory panel formed to study problems at
the agency, which has been under scrutiny ince an investigation of
its generic drug division uncovered evidence of fraud and bribery
last year.
   Kessler, 39, earned an undergraduate degree from Amherst College
in Massachusetts, a law degree from the University of Chicago and a
medical degree from Harvard.
   This will be the first time the position of FDA commissioner
requires Senate confirmation. Previous commissioners have been
appointed by the secretary of health and human services. The FDA is
a part of the Health and Human Services Department.

   President Bush said Thursday he could trade a
modest increase in taxes on affluent Americans for a deep cut in
capital gains rates but that it was ``a waste of time'' to try to
push such a deal through a divided Congress.
   Instead, Bush called on lawmakers to put aside that battle and
come up with a $500-billion deficit-reduction plan that contains
neither element.
   Within hours, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee
said they were well into writing an alternative budget that would
not only raise taxes on rich Americans but push them higher than
Bush has said he can accept.
   The committee's chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, said the
changes would ``restore fairness to our tax system.'' He said the
Democrats would meet again Friday to decide whether the package
will also reduce the capital gains tax rate, but if it does ``it'll
be a lot less rich'' than the administration's version.
   Congressional committees are working toward the goal of finding
a half-trillion dollars in spending cuts and tax increases before
the Oct. 19 deadline when the latest emergency spending
authorization expires.
   By most accounts, higher Medicare premiums and taxes on alcohol,
cigarettes and gasoline are likely to be included.
   ``We believe we have made progress,'' Senate Democratic Leader
George Mitchell said after a meeting with Republican Leader Bob
Dole and members of the Finance Committee.
   Trying to end two days of confusion surrounding the president's
position on taxes, the White House laid out - but said it wouldn't
push - a plan that would combine higher taxes on the 500,000 or so
wealthiest Americans with lower capital gains rates for people who
profit from sales of stocks, real estate and other investments.
   Bush, trying to put the pressure on lawmakers, said, ``The meter
is running, but look, I can't dictate to Congress.''
   His hypothetical package would increase the top rate on the
highest-income people from 28 percent to 31 percent, ease the top
rate from 33 percent to 31 percent for some 4.5 million slightly
less well-to-do taxpayers and chop the rate on capital gains from
28 percent to 15 percent.
   That would do away with the ``bubble'' in the tax code, under
which some upper middle-income taxpayers now pay a higher rate than
the wealthiest.
   The White House held out the proposal as the outer limit of
Bush's willingness to compromise on taxes. Of some Democratic
proposals to raise the top rate to a flat 33 percent, Bush said,
``I cannot accept that.''
   Thursday's proposal by the Ways and Means Committee Democrats,
which they plan to offer on the House floor next week, would indeed
raise the top rate for the richest Americans to 33 percent. And
people earning more than $1 million annually would also pay a 10
percent tax surcharge.
   In addition, cuts to Medicare beneficiaries would total $10
billion over the next five years, down from the $28 billion budget
summit negotiators agreed to last month and $7 billion less than
the full Ways and Means Committee agreed to Wednesday.
   Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, told a Senate panel
that the administration had privately proposed coupling a 31
percent top tax rate with a capital-gains cut last month but had
been turned down by Democrats.
   ``It's my personal opinion that it's not negotiable on
satisfactory terms on both sides,'' Darman told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee. ``There just isn't a deal there.''
   The developments came in a day of damage control at the White
House, as Bush and his lieutenants sought to counter an impression
of presidential indecisiveness on the continuing budget impasse.
   The president presented his case in three separate White House
meetings on Thursday with House Republicans.
   At a picture-taking session at the outset of one of them, Bush
said he was open to suggestions but had little flexibility on the
size of a tax increase he could tolerate.
   Thus, he said he wasn't eager to press Congress to accept a plan
with a 31 percent top rate and a 15 percent capital gains rate. ``I
think it's a waste of time because I just don't think it can get
through both houses of Congress,'' Bush said.
   The White House efforts to clarify Bush's position did little to
end the budget stalemate on Capitol Hill.
   And they were initially accompanied by more of the same
confusion that has reigned for the past few days on the subject.
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, a senior Republican on the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, emerged from a White
House meeting announcing that the president was ready to endorse
the 31-percent top rate, 15-percent capital gains plan.
   ``He is willing, and I think he'll speak to you today about
this, to equalize the level at 31 percent,'' Archer said. His
comments were quickly followed by a statement from White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater seeming to rule out pushing any
such plan.
   Fitzwater said Bush believed that ``pursuing it in the current
context may not only fail; it may legitimize something farther to
the left that we cannot accept.'' In other words, a top rate above
31 percent.
   Among details Congress is working on, the House Ways and Means
Committee voted Wednesday night to eliminate a heating-oil tax that
was included in the budget bill voted down last week and to reduce
the proposed increase in premiums that retirees pay for Medicare
coverage of doctors' bills.
   The Medicare premium, now $28.60 a month, would rise gradually
to $46.50 under the Ways and Means version. The annual $75
deductible that beneficiaries pay for hospital care before Medicare
starts paying would be raised to $100 next year and to $125 in
1992.
   In addition, many tourists entering the United States as well as
railroads and ship lines would face higher costs under other parts
of the giant deficit-reduction bill Congress is piecing together.

   Soviet ballet is going capitalist.
   Yuri Grigorovich, artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet in
Moscow, on Thursday announced formation of a new dance company that
will be self-sustaining, rather than rely on government subsidies.
   Grigorovich said he took out a bank loan to start the company of
60 dancers, ages 19 through 25.
   The new company, the Bolshoi Ballet Grigorovich Company, will
perform for the first time, ``The Nutcracker,'' Nov. 2 at the
Bolshoi Theater.
   Then it will tour five American cities with ``The Nutcracker,''
starting at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas, 90
miles north of Houston. The company will begin rehearsing at Texas
A&amp;M on Nov. 19, give its Western premiere there Nov. 23 and perform
through Dec. 2.
   He declined to name other cities in the U.S. tour.
   At a news conference here, Grigorovich said through an
interpreter that a ballet competition for young Soviet dancers was
held in June. Twenty-one chosen are from the Bolshoi Academy.
Rehearsals started in August.
   And if he can't pay back the loan? ``We'll probably be put where
Dickens spent time - debtors' jail,'' Grigorovich said with a
smile.
   Later he said, ``If everything goes as we have planned, tours
all over the world and performing at home, I think we will be able
to pay the loan back within the next year and a half.''
   He said that building ``The Nutcracker'' sets cost 250,000
rubles and added, ``Nobody knows how to put it into dollars. Until
we switch to a convertible currency, if we do, it will be very
difficult to understand what the actual rate of exchange is.''
   The Entertainment Corp., a British company, will manage the
Bolshoi Ballet Grigorovich Co. outside the Soviet Union.
   Charles Dillingham, Entertainment Corporation U.S.A. president,
said it's hoped companies doing business in the Soviet Union will
sponsor new ballet productions and tours to their countries. The
second tour will be to Australia.
   There also will be performances in the Soviet Union. The Olympic
Center in Moscow, built for the 1980 Olympics, has offered to build
a stage for the new company, Grigorovich said.
   Grigorovich said he took out the loan after the Bolshoi
Theater's general director and the minister of culture told him
they liked his idea for a young company, but had no money to
support it.
   ``I decided to take advantage of the new rights that we have
been given in our country. The three directors borrowed money from
the bank and set up a new company on the basis of total
self-accountancy and being self-sustained.''
   He said some heavy industry companies in the Soviet Union
already have given some moderate-size donations. ``Naturally in
order to survive we need money.''

<TEXT>
   Carlos Thompson, an actor whose
passionate roles in 1950s melodramas gained him an enthusiastic
following throughout Latin America, has died, an apparent suicide.
He was 67.
   Thompson's body was found Wednesday afternoon in his apartment
in fashionable Barrio Norte neighborhood with a bullet wound to the
head, said Judge Luis Cevasco. Foul play was not suspected.
   Two letters were found with the body - one to his agent, Roberto
Fraga, and one to actress Chunchuna Villafane, his partner in the
stage production ``Love Letters.'' Neither explained the suicide,
officials said.
   He was married to German actress Lilli Palmer, with whom he
lived in Switzerland. After her death several years ago, Thompson
returned to Argentina for the first time in nearly four decades.
   Born Juan Carlos Mundin Shafter Thompson on June 7, 1923, he
made his first film at age 16.
   In the 1950s, the tall, dark-haired Thompson was a leading actor
in Argentine melodramas that played to packed houses up and down
the continent. Along with countryman Fernando Lamas, he was the
epitome of the Latin lover.
   His many film roles included a villain in the ``Valley of the
Kings,'' starring Yvonne de Carlo, and ``Flame of Treason,'' in
which he played opposite Lana Turner.
   He also starred in ``El Tunel,'' based on the novel by the noted
Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato.

   Thousands of Jews, many carrying guns, danced
at the Western Wall to end the Sukkot festival Thursday, answering
a government call to assert control over Judaism's holiest site
after bloody riots there.
   ``The large crowd gathered here today shows that nothing in the
world can break us,'' Parliament Speaker Dov Shilansky told about
35,000 people squeezed into the cobblestone plaza in front of the
wall, more commonly known in the West as the Wailing Wall.
   Ultra-orthodox Jews carrying sacred Torah scrolls stood side by
side with less observant countrymen waving Israeli flags.
   Hundreds of riot police, backed by soldiers, were deployed at
the Wall and the adjacent Temple Mount. On Monday, at least 19
Palestinians were killed and 140 wounded when police fired at
rioters stoning Jewish worshipers at the site.
   Many Palestinians living in the nearby Moslem Quarter stayed
indoors as policemen escorted singing and dancing Jews through the
area's narrow alleys to the Wall. Police posted at the gates of the
Old City frisked Palestinians, and many were turned away.
   ``We will prevent young inciters from reaching the area,'' said
Jerusalem's police commander, Arieh Bibi.
   Many worshipers carried submachine guns slung over their
shoulders or had pistols tucked into their belts.
   ``Thousands of people came in answer to those who stoned us.
They should learn that Jerusalem is indivisible,'' Religious
Affairs Minister Avner Shaki told the crowd.
   In New York City, meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council held
consultations to end the stalemate over criticism of the violence
in Jerusalem. But a vote was not expected Thursday.
   Earlier Thursday, police battled Palestinian protesters in
several Jerusalem neighborhoods.
   Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse about 300
Palestinians who tried to march from the city's Shuafat refugee
camp to a major thoroughfare used by many Israelis. Clashes were
also reported in the Issawiyeh neighborhood in east Jerusalem.
   Police fired tear gas to break up a march by about 150
Palestinians to the Temple Mount. ``World, listen to us! We are
people who will never submit!'' the marchers chanted before being
blocked by police from entering the compound.
   Inside, several hundred Arabs marched around the Dome of the
Rock mosque with outlawed Palestinian flags. They chanted the
Moslem battle cry ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is Great.
   Christian leaders, including the Greek Catholic patriarch of
Jerusalem, Lufti Laham, marched from the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher to the Temple Mount to join Moslem clerics in prayer.
   Israeli officials called for the Jewish rally at the Western
Wall at the end of the eight-day Sukkot festival. On the final day,
Jews carry Torah scrolls in a festival procession.
   Israel's two chief rabbis, Avraham Shapiro and Mordechai Eliyah,
had urged Jews to stage the processions in Jerusalem instead of in
their hometowns to erase what they called ``the great blasphemy''
of Jews being stoned at the wall.
   Full-page newspaper ads from the Religious Affairs Ministry
called for mass participation ``in view of the wicked attempt to
desecrate the joy of our holiday near the remains of our temple.''
   The Western Wall is the last remnant of the Jewish Temple
destroyed in 70 A.D. On Temple Mount stand two mosques that
constitute Islam's third-holiest site. The Moslems say this is
where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   More than 1 million of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
occupid West Bank and Gaza Strip remained under curfew for a third
day.
   Palestinians are observing a weeklong strike ordered by
underground leaders of the 34-month-old uprising to protest the
killings.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinian doctors said medical
evidence indicated that Israeli police fired wildly in Monday's
riot.
   ``There was indiscriminate shooting. In one case, we found 14
bullets in one man,'' Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, a physician at east
Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, told reporters.
   Barghouti said that most of the wounded were struck by live
ammunition or plastic bullets, which are lethal at close range.
   He said that of the 120 people treated at Mukassed, 32 remained
hospitalized. Of those, eight were in critical condition, including
a 4-year-old boy with a rubber bullet lodged in his brain, he said.

   Former President Alan Garcia appeared on
Thursday before a congressional committee that will decide whether
he should face criminal charges for his role in the 1986 massacre
of about 250 rebel prisoners.
   As a former president and a lifetime member of the Senate,
Garcia cannot be prosecuted in criminal court unless the committee
decides to revoke his immunity.
   Upon leaving the hearing, Garcia said he would ask that his
immunity be lifted. He said he hopes to ``submit myself like any
other common, ordinary citizen to common justice.''
   A second congressional panel is investigating charges that
Garcia used government funds to buy houses.
   Most political analysts still regard Garcia as the favorite to
be elected president in 1995. No other strong political figure is
in sight, they say.
   As chief of the center-left Aprista Party government from 1985
to 1990, Garcia presided over Peru's worst economic crisis. His
term in office was also marked by increased rebel violence.
   Under the constitution, Garcia was ineligible to run for
re-election in this year's presidential elections, won by Alberto
Fujimori.
   A number of congressmen, especially from leftist parties, say
Garcia should share responsibility for the massacre in June 1986,
when soldiers and police put down riots in three Lima prisons. Most
of those killed were members of the Maoist-oriented Shining Path
rebel movement.
   Garcia publicly criticized lower ranking members of the security
forces for summarily executing dozens of prisoners after they
surrendered. He says he and the military chiefs of staff at the
time of the massacre are guiltless.
   Fujimori also had problems with Congress on Thursday. It
prevented him from attending a summit of Latin American leaders in
Caracas, Venezuela.
   Prime Minister Juan Hurtado Miller said Fujimori abandoned plans
for the trip after the government was unable to convene a special
session of Congress Thursday afternoon.
   The constitution says Congress must approve all foreign travel
by a president. If a president leaves without such approval, he
forfeits his office.
   Fujimori's wife Susana was to travel to Caracas instead, Hurtado
said.
   He said Foreign Minister Luis Marchand Stens will represent Peru
at the meetings.

   Mister Rogers won't allow racial hatred
in his neighborhood.
   A temporary restraining order issued Wednesday against the
Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan prohibits the Klan and three
of its alleged members from imitating the popular children's
television show on a racist telephone recordings.
   On the recordings, a man imitating Rogers makes racist and
threatening remarks against blacks.
   The order issued by U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs requires
the Klan to turn over the racist recordings by Friday.
   Lawyers for Fred M. Rogers, host of ``Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood,'' and Family Communications Inc. said the recordings
infringed on trademarks and copyrights by imitating the sound
effects and song of the television show and Rogers' voice and
speech patterns.
   The order named the Klan and three alleged members, Adam Troy
Mercer of Independence; Michael Brooks, also known as M.B. Madison;
and Edward E. Stephens, both of Kansas City.
   A hearing on whether to make the order permanent was scheduled
for Oct. 20.
   A group of civil rights, community and religious leaders said
last week that the telephone number was widely circulated among
school children in the Kansas City area.
   The same phone number was used earlier this year to promote the
philosophy of the Missouri Knights of the Klan.
   Rogers' lawyers said his television show is broadcast on 600
Public Broadcasting Service stations and reaches 7 million people a
day.

<HEAD>Agencies Find Ozone Levels Near Record Low Over South Pole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ozone hole over the South Pole this year
is almost as severe as the record levels recorded in 1987, two
federal agencies announced Thursday.
   Scientists at both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said that the depletion of ozone over the pole
reached a low point for the year last Tuesday.
   NOAA measurements, taken by balloon released from a South Polar
station, showed that ozone at 9 to 11 miles altitude dropped to 15
parts per billion, less than 1 percent of normal. Normal
concentration is 2,000 parts per billion.
   For the atmosphere as a whole above the station, ozone
concentration was 50 percent of normal, nearly equaling the lowest
level previously recorded, on Oct. 9, 1987.
   A NASA satellite measurement made a similar finding, the space
agency said.
   Ozone in the upper atmosphere is important because the compound
acts as a shield against ultraviolet radiation from the sun. UV
radiation can cause skin cancer and is harmful to some plants.
Scientists believe the Earth's ozone belt is being erroded by the
action of chlorine and some other molecules that come from
industrial pollution. The ozone layer over the South Pole thins
severely each September and October, creating what scientists
called an ozone hole.
   NOAA scientists said that ozone in the air over the South Pole
is normally at 260 Dobson Units, a measure used for ozone
concentrations. Last Tuesday, the measurement dropped to 130 Dobson
units. NOAA spokesman William J. Brennan said that the record low,
recorded on Oct. 9, 1987, is 126 Dobson units.
   Sam Oltmans, a NOAA physicist in Boulder, Colo., said the ozone
depletion over the south pole has been following a pattern of
dipping more severely every other year, with the low points coming
on the odd years.
   The low registered on Tuesday is a change in this pattern, but
Oltmans said it is unclear if the ozone depletion is trending
toward a new, permanently lower level or not.
   ``The pattern has changed for the first time, but this was
predicted because of a circulation pattern in the air currents,''
said Oltmans.
   He said the ozone hole in 1991 may revert to the alternate-year
pattern that has been observed since 1979.

   Tropical storm Marco and a slowly moving cold front crossing the
eastern part of the nation combined Thursday to produce heavy rain
from Florida to Pennsylvania, while record cold pushed deep into
the south-central states.
   Thunderstorms over central Florida produced wind gusts to 62 mph
at Tampa during the morning.
   Moisture flowing northward along the front from Marco hit
hardest in Georgia and the Carolinas, causing low-land flooding and
damaging some roads and bridges.
   Southeastern Georgia got 4 to 7 inches of rain Wednesday and
Thursday, including 7.70 inches at Hinesville, 7.30 inches at
Jesup, and 6.60 inches at Statesboro, the National Weather Service
said.
   Heavier 24-hour rainfall for South Carolina included 9.50 inches
at Honey Hill and Schulerville, and 6.50 inches at Cross and
Bonneau.
   In North Carolina, a storm total of 5.70 inches was reported at
Kannapolis. Wednesday rainfall total of 4.10 inches at Charlotte
was a record for the date.
   Rainfall totals in Virginia for the 12 hours up to 6 a.m. EDT
ranged up to 5.10 inches at Marrowbone Reservoir.
   Parts of Pennsylvania and New York state got 1 to 2 inches.
   Showers developed behind a cold front crossing the north-central
states and were widely scattered from Minnesota to northeastern
Colorado. Snow showers were reported in southeastern Wyoming.
   Showers during the morning produced just enough rain at Akron,
Ohio, to push the city's precipitation total for the year past
their record of 53.36 inches, set in 1890. Normal precipitation at
Akron is 35.90 inches for the year.
   Afternoon temperatures warmed into the 60s and 70s in the
southern Plains after record morning lows in the upper 30s and 40s.
   Record lows were 49 at Brownsville, Texas; 44 at College
Station, Texas; 45 at Corpus Christi, Texas; 31 at Fayetteville,
Ark.; 42, a tie, at Fort Worth, Texas; 55 at Galveston, Texas; 33
at Hot Springs, Ark.; 44, a tie, at Houston; 42 at Midland, Texas;
33 at Ozark, Ark.; 44, a tie, at Port Arthur, Texas; and 42 at
Waco, Texas.
   Overnight lows also were in the 30s and 40s from the northern
and central high Plains to northwestern Minnesota.
   Temperatures also hit record lows in the Northwest, including 22
at Boise, Idaho, and 25 at Klamath Falls, Ore., and Portland, Ore.,
tied its record at 37.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 18 at Gunnison,
Colo.; McCall, Idaho; and Baker, Ore.

<HEAD>Syrian Troops Move against Rebel General's Enclave in Lebanon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tank-led Syrian troops closed in on major
routes to rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's enclave on Thursday and police
said an attack appeared imminent to evict Aoun from Lebanon's
Christian heartland.
   Hours earlier, Aoun's command said his air defenses fired on an
unidentified jet fighter that streaked over his headquarters at the
presidential palace.
   Police said a dozen columns of Syrian T-62 tanks and thousands
of soldiers moved up to combat positions to support President Elias
Hrawi's army along a five-mile front from southern Beirut to the
central mountains east of the capital.
   Most of the buildup was shaping up under parachute flares at the
Tiro district in Beirut's Shiite Moslem southern slums and at the
Druse-inhabited suburb of Kfarshima, four miles farther southeast.
   France was making an 11th-hour mediation bid to persuade Aoun to
abandon the palace and leave for Paris to form a
government-in-exile there, a Hrawi government source said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The source said French Ambassador Rene Ala was in radio contact
with Aoun, urging him to ``leave and spare Lebanon another
bloodbath.''
   ``If and when Ambassador Ala tells us his effort failed, our
forces, backed by the Syrian army, will attack,'' he said. He
mentioned no deadline.
   Several Beirut radio stations announced they were extending
their broadcast beyond the regular midnight closing hour to report
developments.
   Aoun's radio station broadcast a communique instructing
inhabitants of his enclave, home for 150,000 Christians, to ring
church bells all night to ``protest what looks like an imminent
military thrust.''
   An earlier Aoun communique said ``a warplane flew through the
free area over the presidential palace at midafternoon and was
confronted by anti-aircraft fire.''
   Radio stations of rival Christian warlord Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militia said two Syrian MiG-17 jets made two
reconnaissance runs over the hilltop palace at suburban Baabda,
east of Beirut, and then flew eastward toward neighboring Syria.
   The reported overflight heightened fears that Hrawi's mainly
Moslem army was poised to attack with Syrian backing to dislodge
Aoun.
   The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League mandate to end the 15-year-old civil war between Moslems and
Christians.
   Syrian forces have rarely scrambled jets in Lebanon's airspace.
They apparently fear a clash with the Israeli air force, which
dominates and routinely patrols Lebanese skies to film guerrilla
activities of Palestinian and pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalist
factions.
   For the last three weeks, 20,000 Hrawi troops and Syrian
soldiers have ringed Aoun's 80-square-mile bastion in a bid to
starve the maverick general into submission.
   Aoun has vowed to fight unto death if attacked.
   The Syrian-aligned Hrawi fired Aoun as army commander and
interim prime minister last November, when Hrawi was elected
president by Parliament to enforce a peace plan brokered by the
Arab League to end the civil war.
   But Aoun rejected Hrawi's presidency. Aoun has been holding out
with 15,000 troops - most of them Christians - in part of Christian
east Beirut and the adjoining Metn mountains, including the
traditional seat of power in Baabda.
   Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are Maronite catholics, the largest
Christian sect that held power in Lebanon after it gained
independence from France in 1943.

   A mistrial was declared Thursday for a defendant
in the Bensonhurst racial slaying after a juror was dismissed for
screaming across the courtroom at the victim's father.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens, the trial judge,
said Charles Stressler's criminal trial could not continue without
12 jurors. The alternate jurors in the case had been dismissed
Wednesday when deliberations began.
   ``The defendant cannot waive a constitutional right,'' Owens
said. ``The only alternative I have is to declare a mistrial.''
   Earlier, after juror Lydia Bermudez told the judge that she
could not remain impartial and he dismissed her, both defense and
prosecution lawyers agreed to proceed with deliberations and accept
judgment from the remaining 11 jurors.
   However, late Thursday, Owens called the lawyers back to the
courtroom and said he had learned state law prohibited fewer than
12 jurors in a criminal case.
   Stressler will go on trial again Jan. 17, when a co-defendant is
scheduled to be tried on an assault charge, court officials said.
Of those charged in the Bensonhurst attack, one has been convicted
of murder and two of lesser charges, and four still face murder
trials.
   Ms. Bermudez' outburst occurred shortly before noon, after the
jury had heard about an hour's worth of readback of Stressler's
trial testimony.
   She began screaming at Moses Stewart, the father of murder
victim Yusuf Hawkins.
   ``What are you looking at?'' she yelled at Stewart, sitting in
the second row of seats in the courtroom's spectator section.
   ``She's talking to me?'' he asked.
   ``You've been doing that to me every day. You know what I'm
talking about. You've been doing it every ... day,'' she shouted
back at Stewart.
   After a few moments of silence in the stunned courtroom, Owens
called the lawyers and Ms. Bermudez into his chambers to discuss
how to handle the problem. A pool of two reporters were allowed
into the discussions.
   With the judge and lawyers out of the courtroom and the jurors
watching, Stewart stood up and walked toward the door, mumbling
angrily:
   ``If she can't stand the father of the victim looking at her,
get her ... out of here. I look at everybody on the jury. I don't
care who she is, I look at everybody on the jury.''
   In chambers, Stressler's lawyer, Jacob B. Evseroff, moved for
dismissal of the indictment, mistrial or Stewart's exclusion from
the courtroom.
   Owens denied all three motions.
   Ms. Bermudez told Owens she felt intimidated by Stewart and
asserted: ``I don't need this aggravation from this freaking
low-life ...''
   ``Yesterday, he had everybody staring at me .... I don't need
this. I don't need nobody staring at me,'' she told the judge and
lawyers.
   Owens sent Ms. Bermudez out to join the other jurors, and called
in Stewart to hear his side.
   ``Yesterday, I felt the same way,'' he said. ``I felt she has
been trying to get into a staring contest with me. I'm looking at
everybody, not just her.''
   He said that as thevictim's father he had a right to sit in on
all of the proceedings.
   ``I can't exclude him from the courtroom,'' the judge said.
``His argument is as compelling as hers. We'll see which one stares
the other one down.''
   When the reading back of testimony resumed, Stewart returned to
the courtroom for a few minutes, but quickly left.
   Ms. Bermudez slumped in her chair, one hand hiding her face.
   Outside the courtroom during the lunch recess, prosecutors
refused to comment.
   ``I have never, in 42 years, ever seen anything like this,''
Evseroff said.
   The panel began deliberating the case late Wednesday.
   Stressler, 22, is accused of murder, manslaughter, riot and
other crimes in the Aug. 23, 1989, slaying of Hawkins, a
16-year-old black shot through the chest when he and three friends
crossed paths with a mob of young whites in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst
section.

<HEAD>Volunteers Speed Up Soviet Potato Harvest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An offer of free potatoes for anyone who helps
gather them has enticed thousands of city dwellers into the fields
and reduced the chances of hunger this winter, Soviet officials
said Thursday.
   Two weeks ago, newspapers and television broadcasts warned that
the harvest was proceeding very slowly and Moscow had stockpiled
only 7 percent of the potatoes it would need to get through the
winter.
   Fear of hunger spread through the capital, and consumers emptied
grocery shelves, stashing sacks of potatoes in closets and
basements.
   Since then, emergency measures - including ordering soldiers
into the fields and offering to let volunteers keep half the
potatoes they dig up - has doubled and even tripled the rate of the
harvest in many areas, according to official reports.
   ``True, the weather has brightened up a bit, but the main thing
is the massive turnout of (voluntary) helpers,'' Gennady Kulik,
deputy prime minister of the Russian republic, said on the main
television news program, Vremya.
   Vremya reported 160,000 Moscow residents, including 40,000
soldiers, were working in the fields. It showed city dwellers
pulling potatoes from the soil and placing them in buckets - one
for the state, then one for themselves.
   The TV report appeared aimed at reducing the crisis atmosphere
as the country heads into winter amid economic confusion and
shortages of many essential goods, ranging from gasoline to
sausage, tobacco and paper.
   After weeks of debate, the national legislature is still trying
to reach consensus on a plan to switch from central planning to a
market-based system. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev initially
endorsed a radical 500-day plan, then hesitated on whether to allow
private ownership of farms, which he said should be decided by a
national referendum.
   Thursday's upbeat TV broadcast said 75 percent of the Soviet
Union's potato plantations have been harvested, and 40-50 percent
of the planned allocation has been sent to industrial centers.
   Kulik said several cities, including Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk and
Perm, already have filled their vegetable storage facilities and
are fully provisioned for winter.
   He said Moscow has nearly finished stockpiling beets and is
likely to get more carrots than planned. The city also has received
50,000 of the 165,000 tons of cabbage it is expected to use during
the winter, and the cabbage harvest ``is going well,'' he said.
   The TV report did not say what percentage of Moscow's potato
allocation was in hand. But Kulik said deliveries were arriving
from across Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics,
and ``measures are being taken to fully provide the capital'' with
potatoes.
   A bumper crop of wheat also is being harvested, but much of it
is expected to rot or go to waste because of poor transportation
and inefficient bakeries.
   Last month, bread was in short supply in Moscow for the first
time since the early 1960s. A crash program to raise bakers' wages
and put bakeries back in operation eliminated the bread lines
within weeks.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a
$268 billion defense bill Thursday that leaves intact President
Bush's 1991 budget request for the B-2 stealth bomber.
   By voice vote, the panel adopted the legislation after turning
aside an attempt by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to stop production
of the B-2 at six planes.
   ``The greatest threat to our national security is not the Soviet
Union; it is our spiraling debt,'' Leahy told his colleagues. The
lawmaker also pointed to an Air Force review that found widespread
problems with the aircraft's manufacturer, the Northrop Corp.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii and chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee on defense, argued that the measure would result in
the United States spending $3 billion on ``an unfinished science
project.''
   The bill largely tracks the steps taken in August by the Senate
when it approved separate legislation that outlined ceilings on
defense spending for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The committee bill, which would appropriate actual funds, trims
about $1 billion from Bush's $4.7 billion budget request for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, cuts troop strength by 100,000 and
provides $5.1 billion for two B-2 bombers in 1991 and components
for more bombers in 1992.
   The measure includes $238 million for the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor
aircraft but not the $165 million in procurement money the House
included for the program Bush has proposed canceling.
   The committee also adopted by voice vote an amendment
restricting the way the administration can spend money on specific
programs within SDI, commonly known as Star Wars.
   Leahy is expected to bring up the B-2 amendment again when the
full Senate takes up the defense spending plan, possibly as early
as Friday.
   Nevertheless, the panel's action was welcome news to Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a
B-2 proponent.
   ``That'll help; that'll help. We're hanging on by stealthy
fingers,'' Nunn said of the vote.
   Earlier in the day, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice pleaded with
Congress not to decide the fate of the B-2 based on the Air Force
review.
   ``It would be both inappropriate and unwise to use the review,''
Rice told the Senate Armed Services Committee at a
hastily-scheduled hearing. ``Weapon systems must continue to be
judged on the basis of the threat.''
   Seeking to repair the damage to the B-2 bomber program from Air
Force testimony earlier this week on major problems at Northrop,
Nunn summoned Rice before the panel to discuss the service's
review.
   On Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Robert W. Drewes, who led the eight-man
team that conducted the study, told a House panel that Northrop was
beset by problems in nearly every aspect of its business.
   Drewes identified weaknesses in systems engineering, the
transition from research and development to production, software
management, subcontract management, organization and personnel and
business systems, which includes cost and schedule estimates.
   The review did not delve into problems associated with ongoing
federal probes of the Los Angeles-based company. Northrop pleaded
guilty in February to 34 counts of fraud and was fined $17 million,
the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense contractor.
   The plea stems from charges that Northrop falsified reports on
the air-launched cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the
Harrier AV-8B jet.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Donald Riegle's campaign committee paid a
troubled California savings and loan $5,000 this year for catering
services provided at a 1987 fund-raiser, an aide said Thursday.
   Federal law prohibits corporations from donating to candidates
for federal offices. Services are considered ``in-kind,'' or
non-monetary, donations.
   They also are required to be listed in campaign finance reports.
Riegle's campaign did not report the catering services, paid for by
Columbia Savings and Loan, until this year.
   David Krawitz, Riegle's administrative assistant, said the
senator's political organization did not receive an invoice for the
California fund-raiser until late in 1989.
   ``It was our understanding that the bills had been paid,''
Krawitz said. ``When we were informed otherwise, the reimbursement
was made.''
   Columbia Savings and Loan chairman Thomas Spiegel put the costs
on his company expense account, the Detroit News reported. Spiegel
resigned from Columbia last year in the wake of accusations that he
used the thrift's money for personal expenses.
   He is a close associate of Michael Milken, the junk-bond pioneer
who has pleaded guilty to securities fraud violations and is
awaiting sentencing.
   A spokesman for the Federal Elections Commission said he could
not comment on whether the Riegle fund-raiser was financed in
violation of the law.
   The spokesman, Scott Moxley, also declined to say whether the
FEC would investigate the matter.
   Krawitz said it was his understanding that Riegle's campaign
complied with the law by paying the invoice promptly after
receiving it.
   Riegle was not aware of who paid for the catering services and
has done nothing to benefit Columbia, Krawitz said. The Banking
Committee handles legislation affecting the thrift industry.
   The fund-raiser was hosted by the California League of Savings
Insttutions, Krawitz said.
   Riegle, who became chairman of the Senate Banking Committee in

   Following is the breakdown of the number of foreigners in Iraq
and Kuwait as of Oct. 10. Most estimates are based on embassy
registrations.
   An undetermined number of U.S., British, French and West German
citizens are being held in Iraq and Kuwait as human shields around
strategic targets. Others are believed hiding in Kuwait. Some
foreigners, mostly women married to Iraqis or Kuwaitis, have
elected to stay.
   According to U.S. State Department figures, more than 900,000 of
the estimated 3 million foreigners in Kuwait and Iraq on Aug. 2,
when Iraqi forces overran Kuwait, have left.

<HEAD>Resolution to Block Much of Sale Introduced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Administration officials sought to reassure
friends of Israel on Capitol Hill Thursday as a senator introduced
a resolution to disallow most of a $7.5 billion package of new
weapons for Saudi Arabia.
   ``We must not become the unwitting arms supplier for a new Arab
war of annihilation against Israel,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.
   Cranston introduced a bill that would forbid President Bush to
sell advanced M-1A2 tanks, Apache attack helicopters,
multiple-launch rocket systems and TOW 2 missile launchers to the
Saudis.
   The sale of those items, as well as Bradley fighting vehicles,
Patriot anti-missile missiles, tanker planes, trucks and
communications gear was proposed last month to help counter the
threat posed by Iraq, whose troops are dug in along the border with
Saudi Arabia following their conquest of Kuwait.
   At the same time, administration officials briefed members of
the House Foreign Affairs Committee on what the United States is
prepared to do for Israel to counterbalance the Saudi sale.
   The administration already has said it will provide Patriot
anti-missile batteries for Israel, and is believed ready to provide
advanced aircraft as well. Officials are looking at ``creative
financing'' to make it possible for Israel to get the new equipment
without paying for it, said Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.
   ``I would prefer not to see us go down this path with either of
them,'' Levine said. ``We should be pushing regional arms control.
But if the president is determined to sell these weapons to the
Saudis, and the Saudis are determined to have them, we must also
provide Israel with items needed to maintain its qualitative
(military) edge.''
   Levine said he would withhold until next week a decision on
whether to oppose the Saudi sale.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Payment of Overdue United Nations Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Thursday to begin paying
nearly half a billion dollars in past dues to the United Nations
withheld in recent years because of congressional opposition to its
practices.
   Reflecting an about-face prompted by the U.N.'s sponsorhip of a
trade embargo against Iraq, the measure was included as part of a
$19.6 billion money bill approved by a 91-7 vote.
   President Bush last January had requested $93 million as a 20
percent first installment on a five-year plan to pay off the $464
million in U.S. dues arrearages.
   But lawmakers had shown no inclination to go along with it until
the U.N.'s sharp response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August
and subsequent taking of American and other foreign hostages.
   In addition to the $93 million in past dues, the bill includes
$31 million to cover U.S. arrearages for supporting U.N.
peacekeeping forces in addition to the $91 million as the American
share for their support in the current fiscal year.
   Also to support the military effort against Iraqi President
Suddam Hussein, the bill adds $79 million for activating another
five ships in the U.S. Ready Reserve Force for deployment to the
Persian Gulf. Already, 41 ships in the 96-ship fleet have been put
on active duty and sent to the region.
   The bill, which finances the operation of the Justice, State and
Commerce departments for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, also
triples, to $162.5 million, Bush's request for investigating and
prosecuting savings and loan fraud.
   ``The president and the attorney general just don't place a
priority ... on these S&amp;L criminals,'' said Sen. Fritz Hollings,
D-S.C. ``They spend a fortune arranging stings but they have been
stung more than 1,300 times and don't do anything about it.''
   The bill now goes to a conference committee to iron out
differences with a version passed earlier by the House.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. Dan Coats, R-Ind.; Kent
Conrad, D-N.D.; Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho, and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.
   Sens. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., did not
vote.

   Iraqi authorities, in a further tightening of
restrictions, apparently have ruled that no American men 55 years
and older will be allowed to depart Iraqi-controlled territory, the
State Department said Thursday.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler also described as
``simply outrageous'' Iraqi treatment of Americans and foreign-born
family members who left Iraq and Kuwait on Wednesday aboard a
U.S.-chartered evacuation flight.
   Aboard the flight were 321 persons, including 270 U.S. citizens
and their foreign-born family members.
   In a message to Americans still in Iraq and Kuwait broadcast
over the Voice of America, the State Department said no more
charter flights were scheduled.
   ``However, we will continue to assist with the travel
arrangements for all U.S. citizens and thir foreign-born family
members who want to depart and are allowed to do so,'' the
broadcast said.
   The message again urged Americans to ``keep a low profile and
exercise caution,'' and concluded, ``Your release is of the utmost
importance. We will not stop our efforts to gain your freedom until
the last American is home.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said Iraqi authorities interrogated and harassed
the departing passengers both at a Kuwait City hotel and at a
checkpoint en route to the airport in Basra, forcing lengthy
delays.
   Some evacuees said they were threatened with weapons. A dozen
people who signed up for the flight were prevented by the Iraqis
from leaving, she said.
   The delays forced a postponement from Thursday to Friday in the
passengers' arrival at Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina.
The passengers spent the day Thursday in London.
   Virtually all the departing Americans were women and children.
Ms. Tutwiler said U.S. officials have received reports that men
over age 55 are now being prevented from leaving. She said previous
indications were that Americans males of that age were exempted by
Iraqi authorities along with those under 18.
   She declined to give estimates of the number of Americans left
in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Other officials said, however, there were somewhat more than 100
Americans on the flight, most from Kuwait. Based on department
estimates dating back to last month, that would leave perhaps 775
to 925 in the two countries, taking into account Wednesday's
departures.
   About 104 are being detained and the remainder are the targets
of house-to-house searches by Iraqi soldiers.

<TEXT>
   Wisconsin's Chippewa Indians cannot sue the
state for an estimated $300 million in damages resulting from their
being denied hunting and fishing rights for more than a century, a
federal judge ruled Thursday.
   The tribe's only hope to collect damages rests in persuading the
federal government to sue the state on behalf of the Chippewa, U.S.
District Judge Barbara Crabb said, citing recent Supreme Court
interpretations of the U.S. Constitution's 11th Amendment.
   The Supreme Court's analysis ``leaves the plaintiff tribes
without an adequate remedy for the wrongs they have suffered,''
Crabb said.
   The 11th Amendment gives states ``sovereign immunity'' from
lawsuits by tribes and other foreign nations.
   ``I find this wholly at odds with the principle ... that federal
law operates to provide individuals with relief for deprivations of
their `rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution
and laws' caused by state actors,'' she said.
   The federal government was unlikel to join the case, she said.
   The ruling reversed a 1984 District Court decision that the
tribe could sue the state based on a federal law designed to help
tribes resolve treaty disputes.
   The lawsuit was to have been tried last month but was postponed
by Crabb. Her ruling dismisses the claims.
   Earl Charlton, an attorney for the Mole Lake Chippewa band,
described the ruling as a minor setback and said the tribe would
appeal 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
   ``The state still has to resolve this matter. The decision
certainly doesn't address the merits of the case,'' he said. ``This
doesn't vindicate the past actions of the state of Wisconsin in
violating tribal rights.''
   Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and other state officials were
delighted with the decision.
   The ruling confirmed that ``Wisconsin is not responsible for any
damages regarding the exercise of the Indian's treaty rights,''
Thompson said.
   Under 19th century treaties ceding Indian territory to the U.S.
government, Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands retain the right to
spear fish, hunt and cut timber off reservations on 23,929 square
miles of public land in northern Wisconsin.
   Since a court affirmed those rights in 1983, the Chippewa have
encountered huge and sometimes violent protests by non-Indians who
claim the treaty rights give the state's 4,000 Chippewas an unfair
edge and threaten to deplete fish and timber.
   Thursday's ruling is the second setback this year in the 16-year
court battle with the state over treaty issues.
   In May, Crabb reversed another ruling that had allowed the tribe
100 percent of the safe allowable harvest of resources on ceded
lands.
   She ruled that the resources be shared equally between the state
and tribe.
   Efforts to negotiate settlements with two of the most active
spearfishing bands of Chippewa were defeated by the tribe last
year.
   Those agreements would have provided the tribes millions of
dollars over 10 years if the tribes curtailed some of their treaty
rights.

   A case that hinged on whether a 28-week-old
fetus was covered by the mother's insurance has been settled by a
$850,000 payment to the family.
   American Global Insurance Co. had appealed a $1 million judgment
in favor of Sharon and Andre Bonte and their daughter, Stephanie,
to the state Supreme Court.
   The case is believed to be only the second of its kind to have
reached a state supreme court. In a similar case in 1981, the
Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the phrase ``resident of the same
household'' was ambiguous and ruled for the family.
   Sharon Bonte gave birth the day after she was struck by a car
while walking in Manchester in June 1988. The Bontes said that as a
result of the accident, Stephanie, now 2, was born with cerebral
palsy, a nervous disorder usually caused by damage to the brain
before or during birth.
   Andrew Dunn, American Global's lawyer, said the settlement,
reached last week, averted two other lawsuits.
   One, on behalf of Stephanie, would have charged Sharon Bonte
with negligence for crossing the street where there was no
crosswalk, Dunn said. The other would have sued New Hampshire
Insurance Co. - American Global's sister company and Sharon Bonte's
employer - as a landowner, because the accident happened in front
of its offices, he said.
   ``More than $850,000 was involved,'' Dunn said. ``The settlement
in this case also dealt with some issues that may come up in
connection with those two threatened claims.''
   The Bontes' lawyer, Thomas Craig, did not immediately return
calls Thursday, when the Supreme Court was to have heard oral
arguments.
   In briefs filed with the high court, Craig had argued that the
fetus was a member of the Bonte household and should have been
covered under the policy, which covers relatives who are
``residents of the same household.''
   But Dunn said the usual meaning of ``relative'' doesn't include
a fetus in the womb.
   ``It's a contractual issue. It's not an issue of whether the
fetus is a person, of whether the fetus is alive, of when life
begins,'' he said. ``It's not an issue of any cosmic importance -
it's not a philosophical issue.''
   Lawyers agreed the case was unrelated to abortion because it did
not consider whether a feuus has legal rights generally, only
whether it qualified as a resident under the insurance company's
definition.

   Sponsors of a civil rights bill designed to
combat job discrimination made last-minute concessions to the Bush
administration Thursday in a move to save the measure from a
threatened presidential veto.
   Critics said, however, President Bush still appeared poised to
reject the bill on grounds that it would usher in minority hiring
quotas.
   ``At least in my contacts with the administration, they think
this so-called compromise does more harm than good,'' declared Rep.
Harris Fawell, R-Ill., a leading critic, as sponsors overhauled the
legislation.
   The bill would overturn six Supreme Court decisions last year
and has been the top item on the civil rights movements priority
list in recent months.
   Major provisions would reshape complex courtroom procedures in a
way that would make it harder for employers to defend themselves in
lawsuits alleging discrimination in the workplace.
   Other provisions range from a ban on racial harassment on the
job to a obstacles to reopening court-approved minority hiring
agreements.
   The Bush administration has been saying the bill would make it
so hard for employers to win discrimination suits that they would
turn to hiring quotas as a way of protecting themselves in advance
from such charges.
   A House-Senate conference committee that had already produced a
compromise version of the bill went back to work Thursday night and
adopted a seven-point package of concessions designed to win Bush's
backing.
   Even if Bush remains opposed, supporters said, the changes might
attract enough support for the bill to override the threatened
veto.
   The core of the concession package would offer employers greater
leeway in defending against discrimination suits. It also would
make clear that nothing in the bill was designed to encourage the
use of hiring quotas.
   The package was adopted 11-8 by the conference committee.
   Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, who had supported earlier
versions of the bill, voted with critics against it. He said the
changes turned the measure into ``the hollow shell of a civil
rights bill.''
   He said long delays in sending the bill to the White House most
likely will enable Bush to stop the bill with a pocket veto if he
so desires.
   Under a pocket veto, a president is able to kill bills by simply
refusing to sign them when Congress is not in session. Lawmakers
are getting ready to leave Washington and get in a round of
campaigning before November elections.
   ``I'm not criticizing them; they're senators and stuff,''
Washington said, nodding toward Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
``But we could have done this three weeks ago.''
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., also a supporter of earlier
versions of the bill, said it was time to ``come up with something
we hope is more in line with the president's views.''
   Peter Lunnie, head of the Fair Employment Coalition, a business
group critical of the bill, said after the conference committee met
that it appeared Bush would not be swayed by the changes.
   He said there was a White House meeting last week at which
``Sen. (Orrin) Hatch (R-Utah) was told point blank the language was
unacceptable to the president and they would recommend that he
(Bush) veto this bill.''
   Lunnie said Hatch received that message at the meeting from
White House counsel Boyden Gray and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   Civil rights advocate William Taylor said after the conference
committee meeting, however, that it still was not fully clear that
Bush would wield his veto pen when the bill reached his desk.
   ``Everybody has heard it from Boyden Gray, some people have
heard it from Thornburgh, but nobody has heard it from Bush,''
Taylor said.
   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., said earlier it was unclear whether
Bush would approve the fresh version.
   Fish said the decision to go ahead with the last-minute
concessions represented a recognition by the civil rights movement
that the choice now was between winning Bush's support or coming
away empty-handed and refighting the battle next year.
   ``In a sense they have watered down their work product,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Soviet Currency Will Be Devalued, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet ruble will be devalued by about 70
percent in relation to the dollar under Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic reform program, a Soviet economic official
said Thursday.
   Ivan Ivanov, deputy chairman of the state Foreign Economic
Commission, said the new exchange rate for international commercial
transactions would be 1.8 rubles per $1, compared with the current
.56 ruble to the dollar.
   The official news agency Tass quoted Ivanov as telling a
legislative committee that the new rate would be introduced by
presidential decree.
   Tass did not say when the devaluation would take effect. But it
said the rate was calculated on the basis of new Soviet wholesale
prices that are scheduled to become effective Jan. 1.
   The new rate will ``make exports more profitable for Soviet
producers and facilitate the streamlining and restriction of
imports, which have been growing rapidly since Soviet enterprises
were granted the right of free access to the foreign market,'' Tass
said.
   The chairman of the Soviet State Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, had
said this week a devaluation was likely.
   Gorbachev's economic plan, which envisions a gradual switch from
central planning to a market-based economy, is under consideration
by a committee of economists and politicians appointed by the
Supreme Soviet. The committee is scheduled to issue a report by
Oct. 15, after which the plan could be approved by the national
legislature.
   Lawmakers already have voted to give Gorbachev emergency powers
to make the transition to a market, and he has begun issuing
decrees.
   Ivanov said the devaluation would not affect the exchange rate
for tourists converting dollars to rubles at Soviet banks. That
rate would remain at 6 rubles to the dollar, he said.
   Unlike most countries' currencies, whose exchange rates
fluctuate with free trading on international markets, the ruble's
rate is set artificially by the Soviet government. On the black
market, a dollar can fetch 15 to 30 rubles.

   Democrats on the House Ways and Means
Committee began writing their own budget plan Thursday, stuffing it
with higher taxes for the rich and easing the burden other
deficit-reduction proposals put on the poor and the middle class.
   The plan is the most liberal of the burgeoning number of budget
proposals floating around Capitol Hill. Democrats insisted they
wanted to reverse the trends of a decade in which they said the
poor got poorer.
   ``Contrary to what you hear, doing something to reverse this
deplorable trend is not preaching class warfare,'' said Ways and
Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   The new proposal would impose a top 33 percent income tax
bracket on the wealthiest Americans, ending the current ``bubble''
in which the top bracket drops from 33 percent to 28 percent.
   The rich would have to pay a 10 percent surtax on any income
surpassing $1 million. The minimum tax the wealthy pay after all
exemptions and deductions, now 21 percent, would be increased to 25
percent.
   The full Ways and Means Committee adopted a separate plan on
Wednesday containing none of those increases. That plan, the
Democratic proposal and a Republican alternative are expected to be
debated on the House floor next week.
   In the Senate Finance Committee, meanwhile, Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, continued reshaping his proposal in an effort to
attract bipartisan support.
   For example, the latest version would limit itemized deductions
of people with incomes over $100,000 a year; raise to $125,000 the
maximum amount of annual wages subject to the tax that finances
Medicare, and allow monthly premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries
to rise more slowly than negotiators had proposed.
   Rostenkowski said Democrats were still discussing whether to put
a cut in the capital gains tax in the package. He said if it were
included, it would be less generous than what the White House
wants. Bush has said he wants the top rate on capital gains taxes -
levied on profits from the sale of assets - dropped to 15 percent.
Currently, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary
income.
   Under the Democratic plan, the gasoline tax would be increased
by 3 cents per gallon. That is 8 cents less than the full committee
proposal and 9 cents less than President Bush and congressional
leaders agreed to during their budget summit. The federal tax on
gasoline is now 9 cents per gallon.
   The Democrats would limit cuts to Medicare beneficiaries to $10
billion over the next five year. That would be $7 billion less than
the full committee's proposal and $18 billion below the budget
summit agreement.
   As a result, the Democrats would boost the monthly premium
Medicare beneficiaries pay for doctors' coverage - now $28.60 - to
$29.90 next year and $46.20 in 1995.
   In addition, the Democratic proposal would increase the current
$75 annual deductible beneficiaries pay for doctors' expenses to
$100 - below the full committee and budget summit proposals.
   The Democratic proposal would also:
   -Increase from $51,300 to $100,000 the ceiling on annual
earnings from which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax is deducted. The
full committee raised the amount to $73,000.
   -Drop the 2 percent tax on petroleum fuels the budget summit had
produced.
   -Include many elements of the full committee's plan, such as a
10 percent tax on private planes and other luxury items and a
doubling of the 16-cent tax on six-packs of beer.
   The top income tax bracket now drops from 33 percent to 28
percent at $162,770 taxable income for a childless married couple
filing a joint return and at $97,620 for a single taxpayer. The
Democratic proposal would extend the 33 percent bracket to include
all additional taxable income above these bracket points.

   The House on Thursday rebuffed conservative
demands for strict new anti-obscenity curbs on the National
Endowment for the Arts and voted overwhelmingly to let the courts
decide whether federally subsidized arts projects are obscene.
   After an emotional five-hour debate, the House approved a
bipartisan compromise sponsored by Reps. Pat Williams, D-Mont., and
E. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., that would penalize grant recipients if
they are subsequently convicted of violating obscenity laws.
   Passage of the Williams-Coleman measure on a 382-42 roll call
vote signaled a major reversal of congressional sentiment on the
politically explosive issue of federal support for art that some
lawmakers consider offensive.
   A year ago, in the heat of a controversy over support for
exhibitions of works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist
Andres Serrano, Congress approved explicit anti-obscenity
restrictions on the endowment at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.
   On Thursday, the House rejected even more stringent curbs
proposed by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and overwhelmingly
defeated a separate proposal to abolish the $171 million federal
arts agency altogether.
   Williams told reporters the House's resounding approval of the
compromise bill was ``a bigger victory in favor of tolerance and
freedom of expression than I had expected.'' He predicted it would
make it easier for the Senate to resist pressure from Helms and his
allies for new restrictions on the endowment.
   Like a similar measure awaiting Senate floor action, the House
bill would scrap the current Helms restrictions on the endowment
and rely on the courts to make determinations of obscenity.
   The House bill also would renew the endowment's statutory
authority for three years and order reforms in its grant-making
procedures with the aim of making the endowment's decisions more
responsive to the interests of the taxpaying public.
   At the request of Republican negotiators, the bill provides an
increase in the share of grants allocated to state arts agencies
from 20 percent to 35 percent over three years.
   The House planned to vote Friday on a separate appropriations
bill that would boost the endowment's budget from $171 million to
$180 million in the current fiscal year.
   That bill, approved by the House Appropriations Committee, omits
any content restrictions on works subsidized by the endowment. It
also would order endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer to scrap a
controversial requirement that grant recipients sign an
anti-obscenity pledge before they can receive federal money.
   Before it approved the compromise bill, the House voted 249-175
to defeat Rohrabacher's proposal to prohibit support for works that
depict ``sexually explicit conduct'' or sexual exploitation of
children, attack religion, defile the American flag or include ``an
actual human embryo or fetus.''
   House members also buried, 361-64, a proposal by Rep. Philip M.
Crane, R-Ill., to abolish the agency because of its past support
for what Crane called ``obnoxious, perverted and sick'' arts
projects.
   Rohrabacher warned his colleagues that ``the American people are
watching this debate'' on television, implying that House members
who opposed his amendment would face the wrath of voters in the
Nov. 6 congressional elections.
   He said the compromise bill was a fraudulent ``political fig
leaf'' that would do nothing to halt the flow of offensive art
allegedly subsidized by the arts endowment.
   Liberal lawmakers denounced Rohrabacher's tough proposed
crackdown as a possibly unconstitutional attempt to intimidate
artists and squelch freedom of expression.
   Williams said Rohrabacher's proposal was ``copper-riveted,
iron-clad censorship of the first degree.'' Rep. James Scheuer,
D-N.Y., called it ``an offensive and misguided measure.''
   But Rohrabacher won support from several conservatives,
including Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont.
   ``It's a fix ... that allows the junkies to continue to peddle
their depraved, sadistic wares with impunity,'' said Marlenee, who
may be fighting the liberal Williams in 1992 for the single Montana
House seat expected to emerge from redistricting based on the 1990
census.
   Under the compromise, a grant recipient convicted of violating
obscenity statutes would be required to give the government its
money back. The original bill would have barred a guilty artist
from receiving further NEA grants for three years, but the House
voted to allow the artist to apply for a new grant as soon as the
NEA had been repaid.
   The bill says that obscenity ``shall not be funded'' by the
endowment. The current ban forbids the NEA to support any works
that ``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions of
homosexual or sadomasochistic activities and the sexual
exploitation of children.
   Before debate, Rohrabacher denounced the Williams-Coleman bill
as a fraud that would ``open the door to federal subsidies for
anything - no matter how freakish, pornographic or sacrilegious -
that an NEA panel would approve.''
   Rohrabacher announced the support of 20 conservative groups,
including Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, Pat Robertson's Christian
Coalition and the Rev. Donald Wildmon's American Family
Association, for his amendment to impose specific anti-obscenity
restrictions on the arts endowment.
   When the House takes up the money bill Friday, Rep. Ralph
Regula, R-Ohio, plans to introduce a floor amendment that would
forbid support for obscene or indecent works as defined by the
Supreme Court and the Federal Communications Commission.
   Regula's proposal says the endowment chairman shall ensure that
federal supported works are ``sensitive to the nature of public
sponsorship,'' respect ``general standards of decency'' and are
``appropriate for a general audience.''

<TEXT>
   The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi said Thursday
his solution to the Persian Gulf crisis was to have hundreds of
thousands of professional meditators mediate worldwide to try to
harmonize world consciousness.
   The Maharishi, leader of the Transcendental Meditation Movement,
told an internationally broadcast news conference in the
Netherlands that the United Nations ``is like a dead body'' and
only mass meditation can bring bliss.
   He said 7,000 skilled meditators in the gulf region could
improve regional and international atmospheres and make peace
inevitable.
   ``We cannot rely anymore on the political arena of the world,''
the Maharishi said from his European headquarters in the Dutch city
of Vlodrop.
   ``Governments and political organizations are incompetent to
bring about peace and are of no significance.
   ``What happened to Kuwait now can happen to any country or
little emirate here and there. All the military might and efforts
against terrorism are not succeeding.''
   His meditation peace plan for the gulf was heard at the United
Nations and in Washington; Austin, Texas; Cleveland; Boston; Kansas
City; Chicago; Ottawa; Montreal and Toronto.
   Two days ago the United Nations was the site of an international
TV hookup to commemorate what would have been the 50th birthday of
the late John Lennon, one of the Beatles who were followers of the
Maharishi.
   U.N. officials said they make U.N. conference rooms available to
worthy organizations without any rental fee and bill them only for
the cost of services and overtime.
   At the yogic hookup Thursday, only about 30 professional people
in business suits and a few journalists gathered in a small
basement conference room at U.N. headquarters and there was no
transcendental meditation.
   After an opening statement, the Maharishi took questions. Asked
about the United Nations that recently has had some peacekeeping
success, he said: ``It is a nebulous organization. . . . The
Security Council cannot guarantee security to any part of the
world. . . . It's like a dead body.''
   He said, in answer to a question, that U.N. peacekeepers with
light sidearms should be replaced by professional, paid meditators.
``That would be more successful and productive,'' he said.
   ``U.N. efforts in the gulf have failed,'' the Maharishi said.
``That is why we appeal to the people of the world to be united
now.''
   His followers claim that 7,000 is a magic number for creating a
powerful meditative consciousness that can affect urroundings and
behavior. They say this has been proved in more than 500 scientific
studies.
   The Maharishi said responsible governments should designate
special groups of 7,000 people who then would be taught meditation
and a form of levitation.
   ``We would train them to `fly' and that would be the end of all
unfortunate evils in the world.''
   The title maharishi signifies a Hindu teacher of mysticism.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Haiti's interim government said
Thursday it would allow deposed civilian President Leslie Manigat
to return from exile in the United States and run for president.
   ``I am returning to rally men of goodwill to see what can be
done to save our critically ill country,'' Manigat said in a
telephone interview from New York. He said he planned to come back
next week.
   In July, the provisional government of Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
refused Manigat entry for ``reasons of state,'' fearing he intended
to return in his capacity as president.
   But in a communique released Thursday, Interior Minister Joseph
Maxi said Manigat was free to come back.
   The government did not give a reason for changing its mind but
the refusal to allow Manigat in had been widely criticized by
political and human rights groups - particularly after two figures
associated with brutal regimes were allowed to return this year.
   Manigat was deposed in a military coup on June 19, 1988, six
months after he was elected in an election widely believed to have
been rigged by the army.
   He was the army's choice in the January 1988 balloting, held
after elections the previous November were canceled when ruffians
supported by the army massacred 34 voters at the polls.
   Fearing for their lives, most Haitians stayed at home in the
1988 race, undermining the credibility of Manigat's presidency.
   A former history and political science professor, Manigat has
been teaching in the United States, Geneva and Paris. He is
president of the National Progressive Democratic Rally, a
conservative Christian Democratic party. He has repeatedly stated
his intention to run again for president.
   To ensure a free and fair vote, the Dec. 16 elections will be
monitored by the United Nations, the Organization of American
States and the Caribbean Economic Community.
   At least 20 other presidential candidates have said they would
run for the presidency.
   The president-elect will take office Feb. 7, 1991, on the fifth
anniversary of the overthrow of dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier. Duvalier fled to exile in France in 1986, ending 29 years
of brutal Duvalier family rule.
   Political turmoil and violence have plagued this poor Caribbean
nation since Duvalier's fall.

   CBS' new late-nigt ``America Tonight'' news
program was third in late-night ratings its first week and had a
smaller audience than the entertainment shows it replaced, ratings
figures showed Thursday.
   The half-hour series co-anchored by Charles Kuralt and Lesley
Stahl averaged a 2.3 rating last week, two-tenths of a ratings
point less than the preceding week's entertainment shows.
   ABC News' ``Nightline,'' the main competition of ``America
Tonight,'' was well ahead of the latter, averaging a 4.7 rating.
NBC's ``Tonight'' show was the ratings leader, averaging a 5.6.
   Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   CBS research analyst Michael Eisenberg said the new show's first
week wasn't typical because the show's 11:30 p.m. broadcast was
delayed twice last week, the first time by a presidential speech,
the second by a CBS telecast of the baseball playoffs.
   With the playoffs continuing this week and CBS televising the
World Series next week, there'll be more delays of ``America
Tonight,'' he said.
   He said it won't be until the week of Oct. 22-26 that the new
show has what would resemble a typical week.

   The two key adversaries blocking Senate action
on a bill to re-regulate cable television reached a compromise
Thursday that would allow cable companies to continue signing
programming deals that freeze out satellite dish owners.
   Sens. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., reached the
accord after the bill's manager, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, last
month declared it ``dead and buried'' for the year because of
threats of a filibuster by Wirth and a veto by President Bush.
   Bush's veto threat still stands, but Gore and Wirth agreed
Thursday on ``exclusivity'' contracts that would require the
Federal Communications Commission to determine their use illegal if
abused.
   Gore, who wanted to give satellite dish owners and other cable
competitors like so-called ``wireless cable'' operators better
access to the programming produced by the cable industry, said he
hoped the bill could be brought to the Senate floor early next
week.
   ``To those who would continue to block its consideration on
behalf of the cable industry or the White House, I would only say
that such a move would backfire,'' he said, threatening to
introduce a tougher bill on the industry next year.
   Both the Senate bill and a similar measure passed by the House
last month would require cable operators to provide a ``basic
tier'' of cable service - local and public TV stations plus
government-access channels - at rates regulated by the FCC.
   Including converter boxes on TV sets and remote controls, the
Consumer Federation of America, the major promoter of the
legislation, estimates the basic service should cost a cable
subscriber no more than $5 a month.
   The FCC also could adjust rates for some other cable channels
such as Cable News Network, MTV and ESPN, but excluding the premium
services like Home Box Office and Cinemax, in response to consumer
complaints.
   The legislation is a response to a growing wave of consumer
complaints about excessive rates and poor service in many areas
after the industry was deregulated by Congress in 1986.

   A major coal-burning power plant near the
Grand Canyon contributes significantly to wintertime air pollution
over the popular tourist attraction, but it is not the only
culprit, the National Research Council said Thursday.
   The council's report is expected to be used by operators of the
plant, the Navajo Generating Station, as an argument for not
requiring expensive pollution controls.
   The Environmental Protection Agency last year proposed that the
power plant 16 miles from Grand Canyon National Park be required to
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 90 percent.
   To do so, the operators of the plant likely would have to
install expensive ``scrubber'' technology. Critics of the EPA
proposal say that the canyon's air pollution problems cannot be
solved by just reducing emissions from the power plant.
   Sulfur dioxide can be converted in the atmosphere to sulfate
compounds in the form of microscopic aprticles, which are an
important contributor to haze in certain atmospheric conditions,
particularly in air stagnation over the canyon and when in clouds.
   The issue of air pollution over national parks has been a thorny
one for lawmakers trying to work out a new Clean Air Act. The House
version of the bill calls for stricter pollution controls to
protect parks but the Senate so far has agreed only to study the
issue.
   The EPA proposal for tighter pollution controls at the Arizona
power plant came after the National Park Service concluded a $2
million study that purported to tie extensive wintertime haze over
the canyon to sulfur emissions from the plant.
   But Interior Secretary Manual Lujan dismissed the National Park
Service study as inadequate and asked for a review by the National
Research Council, an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences.
   The Academy is a congressionally chartered body charged with
giving the government scientific advice. The National Park Service
is part of the Interior Department and a sister agency to
Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, a part owner of the power plant.
   The council said it was clear that emissions from the power
plant reached the Grand Canyon and that these emissions
``contributed significantly to haze'' over the canyon. Marker gases
deliberately emitted by the plant were found at Grand Canyon, the
council noted.
   The Park Service study said the power plant accounted for 40
percent to 60 percent of the loss of visibility in the park. But
the council said it could not determine how much of the canyon's
haze should be attributed to the power plant.
   Under some weather conditions the haze over the canyon might be
attributed almost totally to emissions from the power plant, while
under other weather conditions the pollution might contain almost
no sulfur from the plant, but sulfur from other pollution sources,
the panel said.
   The Park Service study did not make certain measurements which
could have helped resolve the question, did not adequately treat
the conversion of sulfur dioxide into sulfates, and did not
adequately consider the background concentration of sulfates, the
council said.
   Even with new pollution control equipment at Navajo, the
wintertime haze problem at the canyon ``would likely be reduced,
but not eliminated.''
   The 14-member committee that studied the issue said its
conclusions were not aimed at resolving the question of whether EPA
should require additional pollution controls at the plant. ``These
issues involve policy considerations outside the committee's
purview,'' said the panel.
   According to the EPA, the plant burns 24,000 tons of coal daily.
releasing an estimated 12 tons to 13 tons of sulfur dioxide per
hour, 288 to 312 tons per day. However, the council said the plant
burned about 19,000 tons of coal per day during the study period
and emitted 163 tons of sulfur dioxide per day.
   D. Michael Rappaport, Salt River Project assistant general
manager for governmental affairs, said, ``It's our conclusion that
it would be imprudent for the EPA to base a regulatory decision on
findings that have been called into serious question by a group of
eminent scientists.''
   Dave Ryan, an EPA spokesman, said the council's study ``supports
our basic belief'' but said he could not say how it would affect an
EPA proposal expected by early next year.

   From president to pushcart vendor, most
Mexicans reacted with pride Thursday to Octavio Paz' achievement on
being named the first Mexican Nobel Prize for literature.
   Among fellow writers, many of the congratulations were delivered
with the air of disdain that characterizes the left-leaning
intellectual community's attitude toward its senior defector.
   ``As a poet he has great respect, less as an essayist and none
as a politician,'' fiction writer Paco Ignacio Taibo was quoted as
saying by the Excelsior news service. ``I hope that Octavio Paz
doesn't become a spokesman for the right.''
   Among the more outrageous responses was that of filmmaker Rafael
Corkidi, who charged the prize was the result of publicity that the
television chain Televisa spends on Paz.
   Televisa, which owns the only private television channels in
Mexico, frequently is criticized for leaning to the right in its
news coverage and favoring middle-of-the-road talent in its
programming. The giant network sends out photographs of Paz among
its promotional materials.
   ``Paz' undeniable literary value is wasted with sad speeches he
gives in favor of the company,'' Corkidi said at a poetry festival
in Guadalajara.
   Paz' criticism of leftist intellectuals - and aside from Paz not
many intellectuals in Mexico are anything but - long has estranged
him from the country's literary mainstream, if such a thing exists.
   But Mexican writers who have worked with Paz, such as Salvador
Elizondo, a collaborator on the magazine Vuelta, called the prize
well-deserved.
   ``In the cultural order it gives distinction to one of the most
important figures of the Spanish language,'' Elizondo said.
   ``Despite the controversy and disagreement that Paz' ideological
position generates, his creative quality is indisputable,'' said
Jaime Labastida, a poet who stands opposed to Paz on many political
issues.
   In recent months, Paz has been criticized for traveling overseas
in the retinue of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Salinas, attending meetings in Venezuela on Thursday, sent a
congratulatory message to Paz.
   ``He is a poet and writer of whom we Mexicans feel proud. He has
a universal stature,'' said the president, praising Paz for ``his
deep Mexican and Latin American vision.''
   Paz is already one of Mexico's best-selling writers. Many
students are assigned in school his ``Labyrinth of Solitude,'' a
pithy investigation of the Mexican national character.
   At the Alameda park in downtown Mexico City, the award generated
excitement among a group of sidewalk booksellers.
   Rogelio Galindo of the Sotano bookshop said he had sold 250
copies of Paz' latest work, ``A Small Chronicle of Great Days,''
the past three months.
   ``For him it's good. For me, it's marvelous,'' said Manuel
Marquez, as he rushed to rescue his books from an afternoon rain.
Scooping them off a patch of cardboard on the sidewalk, Marquez
stacked them onto a cart.
   ``We hope this will lead us to read more books and by all
writers,'' said Ricardo Contreras Plata, who has sold books for 22
years on a busy streetcorner opposite Mexico's Palace of Fine Arts.
   Enrique Fuente, owner of the Madero Bookstore, said the award
was ``practically a merchandizing device'' for selling Paz' books.
   ``It's good because he's a Mexican,'' said bookshop customer
Roman Picazo.
   Salvador Diaz Contera, a professor of Greek literature who was
shopping at the Madero, praised Paz as ``one of the best writers''
in Mexico, although he said this is not a great era for Mexican
writers.
   He said Paz' image had suffered among intellectuals because he
seemed to have abandoned his socialist ideals and had become
friendly with the government.
   Paz won many fans among the young in 1968 when he resigned as
ambassador to India in protest over the bloody army attack on
student protesters.
   ``Now he has changed when he sees the retreat of the socialist
ideology in a great part of the world,'' Diaz said.
   In fact Paz began criticizing Marxist governments in the 1970s,
a period that might be construed as revolutionary Socialism's
heyday.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The wrong version of ``Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael'' must have
been released, because this sloppy-looking film never should have
been allowed into theaters.
   The small town of Clyde, Ohio, is the setting. Local kid Roxy
Carmichael left there 15 years ago and found fame and fortune when
she helped inspire the hit song, ``In Roxy's Eyes.''
   Apparantly, the good people of Clyde have been thinking about
nothing else since. Roxy is to return for a grand homecoming and
the town has arranged a day in her honor, with a guided tour of her
old house and a gala ``Roxy Ball'' no one would dare miss.
   Two residents are especially anxious to greet the guest of
honor. Fifteen-year-old Dinky Bossetti (Winona Ryder) is a homely,
eccentric tomboy convinced the departed heroine is her real mother.
Denton Webb (Jeff Daniels) was Roxy's childhood sweetheart and
still pines for her although he is now married with two kids.
   Other highlights include efforts by Dinky's stepparents to ship
her to boarding school, a possible relationship between Dinky and
the class hunk, a fleeting reference to Roxy's bisexuality and the
breakdown of Daniel's marriage.
   None of it really matters. The film lasts just 97 minutes and by
the end you won't really care what happens once Roxy arrives.
``Roxy Carmichael'' was originally scheduled to come out in late
August, and the delay should have been used for a little
fine-tuning.
   Ryder, given several scenes communing with animals, gets to play
a suburban Elly Mae Clampett while Daniels looks appropriately
bored. The supporting performances are embarrassingly flat, as if
the actors were reading off cue cards. And the editing is choppy,
with abrupt cuts and awkward transitions between scenes.
   Who's to blame? Perhaps Jim Abrahams, who directed the very
funny ``Ruthless People,'' but shows no such skill here. Or perhaps
one could fault Karen Leigh Hopkins, making her debut as a
screenwriter and executive producer.
   For Ryder, this is the first of three films scheduled for
release by the end of the year. She'll also be seen in
``Mermaids,'' co-starring Cher and Bob Hoskins, and ``Edward
Scissorhands'' with off-screen boyfriend Johnny Depp.
   ``Roxy'' should be safely out of the way by the time the others
arrive.
   The Paramount Pictures Release is rated PG-13. Running Time: 97
minutes.
   ---&equals;
   Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:

<BYLINE>Brazil to U.S. Banks: Convert Debt Into Long-Term Bonds
^By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed Thursday to
convert $60 billion of its debt to private foreign creditors into
medium- and long-term government bonds.
   The conversion scheme was announced simultaneously by Secretary
of Economic Policy Antonio Kandir to U.S. bankers in New York and
by Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello to ambassadors from
creditor nations in this inland capital.
   The negotiations involve $60 billion owed to private lenders in
the U.S., Japan and Europe. Brazil's total foreign debt is $114
billion, largest in the Third World.
   ``We want to prove that Brazil is a solvent country that only
has occasional liquidity problems,'' Cardoso de Mello said after
briefing ambassadors of the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Great Britain, Italy on the proposal.
   She said the repayment plan offered three options:
   -All debt would be converted into long-term ``zero coupon
bonds'' paying annual interest. These bonds could be recovered when
they mature, or beforehand, at government auctions held every three
months.
   -Short-term exit bonds would be available for purchase at
greatly reduced interest.
   -Medium-term bonds would be available at slightly reduced
interest, according to the purchasing capacity of the buyer.
   Cardoso de Mello declined to give details of payment terms or
interest rates, she said, ``because they form part of our
negotiating strategy.''
   Brazil has accumulated some $6 billion in arrears on interest
payments of its debt to private banks, which it has been under
pressure to repay.
   Cardoso de Mello said this amount would be included in the
overall restructuring of Brazil's total debt.
   She also proposed separating debt owed by private Brazilian
firms from money owed by the government, which would permit Brazil
to immediately restart debt payments.
   Debt accumulated by private Brazilian firms would not be
included in the bond conversion plan, she said.
   ``The private sector, if it has dollars available, can pay its
debt when and how much it wants,'' said Cardoso de Mello.

<HEAD>Investigators in Florida Student Killings Re-examine Louisiana
Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The task force investigating the deaths
of five Florida students is taking another look at an unsolved
triple slaying in Louisiana because of striking similiarities in
the crimes.
   The stabbing deaths in Shreveport, La., of Julie Grissom, her
father and her nephew came to the attention of the Gainesville task
force early in its investigation.
   Investigators at first disregarded similarities because Edward
Humphrey was not in Shreveport at the time of the November 1989
slayings, sources told The Miami Herald in a story published
Thursday.
   Now, physical evidence seems to be pointing away from Humphrey
and investigators are again looking into the Grissom case, the
Herald said.
   Humphrey, a 19-year-old University of Florida freshman, has been
listed as a suspect in the slayings.
   He was convicted Wednesday of battery on an person over the age
of 65 for the Aug. 30 beating of his grandmother, Elna Hlavaty. The
beating occurred shortly after Humphrey returned home to
Indialantic from Gainesville two days after the last two bodies
were found in apartments near the university.
   Humphrey faces up to 22 months in prison when he is sentenced
Nov. 8. He also faces an unrelated attempted sexual battery case in
Indian River County and an assault charge in Gainesville.
   Last week, a Shreveport detective flew to Gainesville to help
the task force.
   Shreveport police homicide Lt. Gary Pittman confirmed that one
of his detectives spent several days in Florida with the task
force. But he cautioned against concluding that one killer was
responsible for all eight deaths.
   ``Right now, we're proceeding as if they're not related,'' he
said.
   Authorities believe the intended victim in the Shreveport
killings was 24-year-old Julie Grissom. Her father, William T.
Grissom, and her nephew, 8-year-old Sean, also died in the Nov. 4,
1989, attack.
   Among the similarities in that case and the Florida murders, the
Herald said:
   - Ms. Grissom was a petite brunette student at Louisiana State
University. The four women killed in Gainesville were petite
brunettes between the ages of 17 and 23 and attended the University
of Florida or Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville. The young
man killed was living with one of the women.
   - The killer posed Ms. Grissom's body to shock whoever found
her. The Gainesville killer also posed the bodies of victims.
Investigators in both states say the killer may have photographed
the crime scenes.
   - In both states, the killer left behind little evidence.
   - The Shreveport killer used tape during the killings but
removed it from the victims or took it with him. The Gainesville
killer did the same thing.
   - Both killers used liquids (vinegar and household cleaner) to
destroy evidence on the victims' bodies.
   Some of the Gainesville victims were mutilated, but Ms. Grissom
was not.
   Serial killing experts, however, say it is not uncommon for a
killer to become increasingly brutal.

<HEAD>Experts Urge Caution on Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts on China recommended Thursday that the
U.S. Congress not provoke Beijing or raise disastrously false
expectations in offshore Taiwan by suggesting a plebiscite on the
island's future.
   Maryland University Law Professor Chiu Hungdah said mere use of
the word plebiscite in a proposed resolution would be offensive to
Chinese officials, especially on the mainland, because of the ``One
China'' policy staunchly upheld by the United States as well as
both the Beijing and Taiwan governments.
   That policy insists there is only one China and the offshore
island of Taiwan is part of it.
   Brown University Political Science Professor Michael Kau said
terms such as ``plebiscite'' or ``Taiwan independence'' were ``too
emotionally charged'' for a congressional resolution.
   But, he added, ``I fully agree that the future of Taiwan should
be determined in accordance with the opinion of the people of
Taiwan and I think even the government in Beijing should not object
to that kind of idea.''
   Maysing Yang, director of the New York-based Asia-Pacific
Council on Democracy, an private advocacy group, took issue with
the two scholars at a hearing of the House subcommittee on Asian
and Pacific Affairs.
   She testified that plebiscite is not an emotional word and
Congress should freely vote its sentiments about democracy.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., the subcommittee chairman, was
seeking opinions on his draft resolution about taking into account
Taiwanese views on the island's future through ``democratic
mechanisms such as a plebiscite.'' The draft said Beijing's 1989
crackdown against democracy ``seriously undermines the credibility
of its pledges on any issue'' including peaceful union with Taiwan.
   While pressing for more democracy on Taiwan, the United States
should avoid creating ``a false expectation'' of support for
independence or self-determination, Chiu testified. This would
encourage advocates of independence to move Taiwan ``on a course of
military confrontation with the Chinese Communists which can only
bring disaster to all the people of Taiwan,'' he added.
   A Taiwanese dissident recently freed after 11 years in prison
apologized to the panel, saying that it would be inappropriate, for
him, as a Taiwan citizen, to answer questions about the degree of
democracy on the island.
   Shih Ming-deh noted, however, that many people have urged him to
tell the U.S. lawmakers that ``there are those imprisoned because
they dissent in word and thought; the civil rights and the right to
work of those who have been imprisoned over these long four decades
have not been restored ... those in Taiwan who are engaged in
environmental, labor and farmer movements are targeted by the
government to be treated as mobsters.''
   Shih's American-born wife, Linda Gail Arrigo, interpreted for
him as he added, ``other people requested me to tell the American
Congress that Taiwan is not part of the Peoples Republic of China,
and the people of Taiwan have the right to self-determination and
independence.''

   Economically pressed Argentina wants
to enter OPEC, according to a news report Thursday.
   Argentine President Carlos Menem was quoted by Venezuela's
government news agency Venpres as saying Argentina plans to free
its domestically controlled energy prices in January and to
increase foreign oil sales so it can join the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``Although our oil exports are still small, we are slowly
increasing them to reach our goals,'' Menem was quoted as saying.
Menem has been president of Argentina, which has rich natural
resources but has been debilitated by years of chronic economic and
labor problems, since July 8, 1989.
   He said Argentine oil now earns nearly $400 million per year.
``Argentina is a country with oil, and it has the option of
gradually increasing exports,'' Menem said.
   Venezuela and Ecuador are the only Latin American members of the
13-nation OPEC cartel. Mexico and Colombia also export oil.
   Menem spoke while attending a two-day summit of eight Latin
American presidents that began Thursday in Caracas.

<TEXT>
   A judge Friday suspended the
rebellion trial of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and two others until the
Court of Appeals rules on several petitions filed by the
defendants.
   Enrile, Rebecco Panlilio and his wife Erlinda were to have been
arraigned Friday on rebellion charges in connection with a failed
coup attempt last December.
   But Judge Jaime Salazar noted the three defendants had filed
petitions with the Court of Appeals to halt the case.
   Enrile and the others were indicted in February after witnesses
claimed they saw coup leader Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan
at the opposition senator's home on the first day of the failed
putsch.
   Enrile denies the charge. The Panlilios were attending a party
at Enrile's home in Makati on the day of the coup attempt.
   Chief prosecutor Aurelio Trampe charged the defendants were
using stall tactics. Salazar also expressed frustration over the
delays.
   ``The case is hanging in the air,'' he said. ``I'm for speed.
What is important is the trial on the merits.''
   Enrile was first charged with rebellion and murder, but the
latter charge was dropped. He could face up to 20 years in prison
if convicted of rebellion.
   Enrile, defense minister under late President Ferdinand Marcos,
led the Feb. 22, 1986 mutiny against Marcos that triggered the
uprising that lifted Corazon Aquino into the presidency.
   Mrs. Aquino fired Enrile from the defense ministry in November
1986 after a failed coup by his followers. Enrile ran successfully
for the Senate in 1987 and used his post there to lead opposition
to Mrs. Aquino.

   Eight Latin American presidents opened
a two-day summit Thursday with talks on the effect oil price hikes
from the Persian Gulf crisis have had on the region and on
President Bush's proposal to create a free trade zone in the
Americas.
   The closed-door sessions were held without ceremony at a
downtown Caracas hotel.
   Host President Carlos Andres Perez said a communique would be
issued Friday describing ``the fundamental agreements that exist
among us, and explaining how the political will to integrate our
economies has strengthened.''
   Nine presidents were to attend the conference, but Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori was prevented from leaving his country
at the last minute because he lacked congressional authorization.
First Lady Susana Higuchi de Fujimori was to arrive Thursday
evening in his place.
   Presidents attending were Carlos Menem of Argentina, Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil, Patricio Aylwin of Chile, Cesar Gaviria
of Colombia, Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador, Carlos Salinas de Gortari of
Mexico, Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay, and Venezuela's Perez.
   The so-called Group of Rio was founded with eight members, and
Chile and Ecuador were accepted as members Thursday. Panama was
suspended from the group during the government of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega. The inclusion of Bolivia and Paraguay was expected
to be announced Friday.
   Perez and Argentine Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo said oil
prices and what they called ``Latin American security on energy
matters'' dominated most of Thursday's four-hour session.
   Aylwin on Wednesday suggested the region create a Latin American
and Caribbean investment fund with windfall profits generated by
high priced oil and sales of other raw materials. He said he would
raise the idea at the summit.
   ``It would mean studying how nations of the continent can help
each other reciprocally, taking advantage of the fortunes that some
countries might have at certain times,'' Aylwin said.
   Conference sources said the Chilean leader's idea drew
considerable interest.
   Borja, whose OPEC nation is one of four Latin American oil
exporters, said the oil price hikes posed problems for producing as
well as consuming nations. Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia also
export oil.
   Although consuming countries face high and even devastating
expenditures, producers risk runaway inflation through the
injection of massive funds into their economies, the Ecuadoran
leader said.
   Thus everyone should ``work to stabilize petroleum prices. The
current increase doesn't favor anyone,'' he said.
   He called on multinational oil companies and countries with
large strategic oil reserves, such as the United States, to put
stored oil on the market to force prices down.
   Lacalle, whose nation imports all its oil, presented the other
side of the coin. Uruguay's oil bill will jump at least 10 percent
as a result of the crises, he said.
   On the Bush initiative, which proposes free enterprises zones in
Latin America and forgiving some Latin debt to the U.S. government,
Borja said it was the first time ``an American president is
recognizing that the Latin American foreign debt is a political
problem, not only an economic one.''
   ``How can it not be political, if our democratic system depends
on it?'' he asked rhetorically.
   Lacalle was more enthusiastic, saying that as soon as Bush
presented his June 27 speech ``I called him up in the White House
Oval Office to tell him I'm 1,000 percent behind his initiative.''
   But Lacalle said the general proposal must quickly be made more
concrete.
   The fight against drug traffic and environmental preservation
are also important themes on the summit agenda.

   Former spies for East Germany have handed over
information about top-secret military projects in West Germany,
including the development of the Tornado fighter jet, officials
said Thursday.
   The new disclosures followed the arrest Wednesday of eight
alleged spies. For a people accustomed to wild tales of oold War
espionage in their own backyards, the new reports are causing some
extra head-shaking across the recently united Germany.
   The alleged Communist East German spies include a 63-year-old
woman, her son and daughter-in-law.
   The ZDF television network said two more suspected spies were
arrested on Thursday, but gave no details.
   The espionage activities stretch back to the 1960s and the era
of highest tensions between East and West.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has appealed to former East
German spies to come in from the cold, and it is speculated they
could face lighter prison terms for doing so.
   Kohl, however, warned in an interview that the legacy of the
East German spy service must not ``poison our nation's
atmosphere.''
   ``We must in no way open up a witch-hunt, but protect our
capacity for reconciliation,'' the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper
quoted Kohl as saying.
   Earlier this week, Germans learned that the same top secret
intelligence summaries that reached Kohl's desk each week wound up
in Communist East Germany's spy headquarters.
   Klaus Kuron, a top spy, quickly started naming names after
turning himself in to authorities Sunday. That led to the arrest of
the eight spies whose crimes were outlined by the chief federal
prosecutor's office Thursday.
   Late Thursday, the Cologne newspaper Express said Kuron's former
East German control officer had also been arrested. There was no
immediate confirmation from authorities.
   One of the group of eight arrested, identified only as Karlheinz
S., allegedly passed on directly to the Soviet KGB information
about a new tank under development, the chief federal prosecutor
said.
   Another agent identified only as Franz M. passed on to the East
Germans ``information and documents'' about military helicopters.
The prosecutor said the agent obtained the information while
working for Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Bloehm, the largest West German
aerospace manufacturer.
   Two other people are accused of handing over to the East Germans
information about the development of NATO's sophisticated Tornado
fighter jet. They allegedly took pictures of the original
top-secret documents and passed them on to the Soviet Bloc agents.
   All eight of those arrested come from West Germany, according to
chief federal prosecutor Alexander von Stahl.
   The Associated Press called von Stahl's office to learn the last
names of those arrested, but the spokesmen had already left for the
day and were unreachable at home.
   Where the latest round of arrests and disclosures will stop no
one knows. Von Stahl says more developments are expected, and he
has a pool of 8,000 former East German spies to pick from in the
coming months.
   Leaders of the former East German security service, known as the
Stasi, are believed to have abetted some of international
terrorists. News reports say the terrorists may still be lurking on
German soil.

<HEAD>Walgreen Orders `Slap Bracelets' Removed From Shelves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Walgreen Co. said Thursday it had ordered
its drug stores nationwide to remove ``slap bracelets'' from their
shelves while the safety of the fad jewelry is investigated.
   The action was taken Wednesday in response to a complaint
Tuesday that a Connecticut child received a minor cut while playing
with a bracelet, said Maryellen Thielen, spokeswoman at Walgreen
corporate headquarters in this Chicago suburb.
   ``We just want to make sure that if and when we do put them back
on the shelves we know they are safe,'' Thielen said. ``And while
we are investigating we have asked them to remove them.''
   Also Thursday, Connecticut consumer protection officials ordered
the recall of Taiwan-made imitations of the popular toys.
   The bracelet consists of a 9-inch strip of metal encased in
brightly colored cloth. When the strip is slapped against the
wrist, it wraps itself around the wearer's arm.
   The state Department of Consumer Protection issued the recall
order after testing three versions of the bracelets for exposed
sharp edges, which are prohibited on most toys under the state's
Child Protection Act.
   Only one version passed the tests: ``The Original Slap Wrap''
bracelets made by Simsbury-based Main Street Toy, said Lois Bryant,
director of the department's product safety division.
   Those that failed were labeled ``Made in Taiwan'' or lacked
labels, she said.
   The slap bracelets sold by Walgreen are imitations.
   Main Street Toy maintains that its bracelets, made with
stainless steel, are not dangerous, but that imitations are made
from cheaper steel that will rust and snap.
   When 4-year-old Nicole Tomaso wrapped the bracelet she got at
Walgreen in Wallingford, Conn., around her wrist Tuesday, a piece
of metal protruded from the toy's sewn end and she cut her finger,
her father said.
   The bracelet that caused the injury was an imitation. Slap Wraps
sell for $2.49; the imitations cost less, usually 99 cents.
   Elementary school officials in Pelham, N.Y., banned the wraps
last week after becoming concerned about children cutting
themselves.

<HEAD>Two Japanese Sailors Freed After 7 Years by North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Japanese sailors, held nearly seven years in
North Korea, returned home Thursday after being released by the
communist North in an apparent bid for closer relations with Japan.
   Isamu Beniko, 60, and Yoshio Kuriura, 59, looked healthy and
relieved as they stepped off a chartered All Nippon Airways
airplane into bright sunshine at Haneda Airport.
   In a scene televised live and nationwide, Beniko broke with
customary Japanese reserve and waved vigorously toward the airport
terminal. After a private reunion with their wives inside the
plane, the two seamen were driven to a local hospital for medical
checkups.
   ``He hasn't changed much. I was relieved,'' Beniko's wife,
Maneko, said in a news conference.
   Returning on the same plane from Pyongyang, North Korea's
capital, were top officials of Japan's two largest political
parties, which had negotiated the men's release in a period of
unprecedented contact between Japanese politicians and the North
Korean government.
   Japan has no diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. It recognizes
the North's archrival, South Korea.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told reporters at his official
residence that he was happy about the seamen's return, Kyodo News
Service reported.
   Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo, said they were given amnesties ``from a humanitarian
stand.''
   On Wednesday in Pyongyang, North Korean President Kim Il Sung
and Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Japan's governing Liberal
Democratic Party, agreed that the two Asian neighbors should begin
talks to establish diplomatic relations quickly, the nationally
circulated newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported.
   Ozawa and Takako Doi, chairman of the opposition Japan Socialist
Party, had been invited to celebrations Wednesday of the 45th
anniversary of North Korea's ruling communist party, called the
Workers Party.
   Beniko, the captain, and Kuriura, the first mate, were seized in
November 1983 on a return voyage to North Korea on the Japanese
freighter Fujisan Maru No. 18, on which a North Korean soldier, Min
Hong Gu, had stowed away to Japan.
   Japan rejected the North's demand that Min be sent home. In
1988, it granted him permission to live in Japan.
   Meanwhile, in December 1987, North Korea retaliated by
sentencing the two seaman to 15 years in prison for alleged spying.
Their release became a key hurdle to improved Japan-North Korea
relations.
   Late month, a delegation from Japan's governing party met in
Pyongyang with North Korean officials and the two sides agreed to
open talks in November on establishing diplomatic relations between
the two countries.
   Japan ruled the Korean peninsula as a colony from 1910 until its
defeat in World War II in 1945. After the war, the peninsula was
split into the Communist North and the capitalist South, and the
two fought a bloody war in 1950-53.
   South Korea normalized relations with Japan in 1965.
   Min, 27, a former army sergeant who now lives north of Tokyo,
was quoted as saying he was happy about the seamen's release.
   ``I would like to meet the two men, without much publicity, and
apologize. I would like to do anything in my capacity. I could give
them my kidney,'' Kyodo quoted him as saying.

<HEAD>Egyptians Vote in Referendum Over Dissolution of Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptians voted Thursday in a referendum to
decide whether to give President Hosni Mubarak a mandate to
dissolve Parliament.
   Security officials meanwhile remained on alert to terrorists
threats spawned by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa, whose ministry handles
internal security, said Arabs angered over Mubarak's anti-Iraq
position are threatening Egypt with sabotage and assassination.
   Five Moslem fundamentalists were reported arrested in a southern
city for distributing antigovernment leaflets. Otherwise, voting
was reported occurring without incident.
   The voters had to answer ``yes'' or ``no'' to the question: ``Do
you approve of the dissolution of the People's Assembly?''
   Government officials expected a comfortable, probably
overwhelming, affirmative vote. Under the constitution, that would
allow Mubarak to disband the assembly, declared illegal by the
country's highest constitutional court, and call new elections
within two months.
   More than 23,000 polling stations nationwide opened in the
morning Thursday for nine hours.
   The turnout in Cairo and major cities appeared low.
   Mubarak and his wife Suzanne voted at the northeastern Cairo
suburb of Heliopolis, their official residence.
   In southern Egypt's Assiut, police armored cars and trucks were
seen at key points, including squares and within the Assiut
University compound. City and university have been for years
centers of hard-line Moslem antigovernment agitation.
   Assiut police sources said five fundamentalist students were
arrested on campus as they distributed leaflets. The sources said
the leaflets opposed holding the referendum now and attacked the
presence of American and other Western forces in the gulf region.
   Officials said security was tightened nationwide in preparation
for the referendum. In the past week, authorities have reported the
arrest of 35 Palestinians and Iraqis suspected of planning
sabotage.
   Mubarak has led Arab opposition to Iraq's Aug. 2 conquest of
Kuwait.
   ``In addition to Iraq, some Palestinian factions have threatened
Egypt openly with sabotage and acts of terror,'' Interior Minister
Moussa told a Cairo seminar. ``They said they will export
terrorists to Egypt to assassinate public figures.''
   Mubarak suspended the 458-member People's Assembly on Sept. 26
because of a May 19 ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court that
the assembly was elected under an illegal law. He also scheduled
the referendum on dissolution as required by the constitution.
   The seven-judge court said provisions of the law violated the
constitutional principle that all Egyptians must be given equal
opportunity to be elected to public office. It let individuals run
against each other alongside balloting for candidates on political
party lists.
   Using his executive lawmaking powers in Parliament's absence,
Mubarak promulgated an election law that appears to satisfy the
court's objections. He canceled the party-list method and
proportional representation and revived the system of voting among
individual candidates that prevailed in Egypt under the monarchy
ended by a coup in 1952.
   The president also redrew electoral districts, creating 222
constituencies instead of 48. The next parliament will have 444
elected members, two from each district, and 10 appointed by
Mubarak.
   Egypt has an electorate of about 15 million from a population of
55 million. Everybody over 18 can vote, but political apathy causes
some men and many women, particularly in rural areas, to neglect to
register.

   The House is being asked to approve the
second-largest tax increase in history - a $144 billion plan to
boost taxes on gasoline, tobacco, alcohol and higher-income
Americans.
   ``I really think this plan could pass,'' Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis.,
said after the House Ways and Means Committee approved the
deficit-reduction plan by voice vote on Wednesday.
   A similar plan is in the making in the Senate Finance Committee.
   Either version could be amended to include President Bush's
proposed capital gains tax cut. But prospects for such a change are
clouded by doubts about whether the president would support raising
tax rates on the rich as part of the bargain.

   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - White House chief of staff John Sununu's
reputation as ``big, bad John'' on Capitol Hill comes as no
surprise to former associates in New Hampshire who say his
persistence as governor sometimes turned into belligerence.
   But even some bruised in the legislative give-and-take during
his six years as the state's chief executive admire his ability to
get things done.
   ``They're so used to being treated with such deference in
Washington,'' House Democratic Leader Mary Chambers said Wednesday.
``They go home and everybody bows and scrapes and wants to shake
their hand. They get pretty arrogant and self-satisfied.
   ``Someone like John Sununu comes along and doesn't care who they
are. The mission of getting the job done, that's his driving thing.
It amuses me to read what they say about him.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - They are in their third month of holding out
against all odds - 10 U.S. diplomats refusing to bow to Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait or to leave other Americans in the terrorized
Persian Gulf country without an official U.S. presence.
   Not that Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell and his beleaguered
staff can do much for their 500 or so countrymen, many of whom are
in hiding and several of whom are desperately ill.
   Telephone conversations are intentionally brief, on the
supposition that Iraqi eavesdroppers are listening for useful
information about the whereabouts of the elusive Americans, their
risk-taking Kuwaiti protectors or Washington's intentions.
   Through satellite communications, the embassy also is in touch
with the State Department.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - More than 33,000 military reservists have been
called to active duty in support of the U.S. buildup in the Persian
Gulf area - nearly as many as were activated during crises in
Vietnam and Korea in 1968.
   The Army today activated 12 National Guard and 24 Army Reserve
units from 24 states and Puerto Rico, for a toal of 4,846 troops.
Meanwhile, the Marine Corps said Wednesday it was calling up about
160 reservists.
   Those actions brought to 33,252 the number of reservists from
all services activated since Aug. 22 when President Bush authorized
their use in support of Operation Desert Shield.
   None of the reserves called so far are from combat units; all
are performing combat support or combat service functions such as
cargo handling, air, sea and ground transportation, water
purification, intelligence and security.

   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) - NASA pronounced an end to its
losing streak after Discovery completed a nearly trouble-free
mission that sent a probe speeding toward the sun.
   ``We showed the world that the shuttle and NASA is reliable and
can meet their commitments,'' said Aaron Cohen, director of the
Johnson Space Center.
   The shuttle and its five astronauts swooped out of orbit and
glided to a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Wednesday
after a four-day flight. It was NASA's first shuttle mission in six
months.
   Only a few problems were reported from blastoff to touchdown,
including a computer programming error discovered after takeoff
that was considered serious but no threat to the shuttle or crew,
said Milt Heflin, lead flight director.

   BOSTON (AP) - Coffee drinkers, delight. A good cup of joe, or
two, or three, won't hurt the heart, Harvard researchers reported
today.
   In fact, coffee with caffeine, the often maligned chemical that
gives the brew its kick, may turn out to be easier on the heart
than the decaffeinated variety.
   ``It's amazing how coffee has a bad name, when the harder one
looks at health hazards, the more difficult it is to find adverse
effects,'' says Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public
Health.
   His research, part of a huge study of healthy people, shows that
those who drink several cups of ordinary caffeinated coffee every
day do not raise their risk of heart attacks.

<HEAD>Inflation: A Daily Struggle for Brazilians</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marta de Teixeira Campos knew the
price of a frozen chicken, but that was yesterday. It had risen 50
percent overnight.
   The rice, black beans, cooking oil and cheese in her cart were
vital if her four children were to be fed, so Mrs. Campos
reluctantly handed the chicken back to the supermarket cashier.
   She and most of the 150 million other Brazilians are feeling the
bite of a resurgent inflation that makes survival a daily struggle.
   Wages don't go up to match prices, and the public is gradually
losing confidence in the economic ``shock'' plan decreed by
President Fernando Collor de Mello on Mar. 15.
   Inflation plunged from 84 percent in March to 3.3 percent in
April and the poor, elated by their new buying power, gave Collor a
74 percent approval rating in May.
   Unfortunately, inflation didn't go away. Prices rose 9.6 percent
in June, by August the monthly rate was up to 10.5 and in September
nearly reached 13 percent.
   Helio Jaguaribe, a leading sociologist, said inflation had ``now
reached the level where it is biting into basic needs.''
   Brazilians shrugged off inflation for years because
cost-of-living indexing protected wages and savings. The government
had to print money to pay the bill, however, and that made
inflation worse.
   In June, Collor did away with wage indexing and said workers
must negotiate their own pay increases.
   In September, he abolished rent control to encourage
construction and rents tripled overnight. A one-bedroom apartment
in the affluent South Zone that rented for $500 a month last year
now costs $1,700.
   People returning from winter vacations found the 800-cruzeiro
ride from home to the airport cost 1,900 in the other direction.
   A movie ticket has tripled in two months to 300 cruzeiros, about
$3.40. A month of lambada dance lessons doubled to 5,000 cruzeiros,
or $56, and the cost of an international telephone call has tripled
since June to about $5 a minute.
   Prices of auto parts inhabit an unreal world of their own. A
Volkswagen distributor charges $95 for a headlight, enough to buy
more than 26 pounds of prime beef.
   Newspapers are filled with announcements of price increases.
Magazines offer advice on how to cope and invest money, and carry
classified ads from people who want to pool stocks of food and
household items.
   Prices vary wildly. A men's linen shirt costs the equivalent of
$560 at a one shop in downtown Rio and a similar one goes for $80
at another.
   All prices may be going up, but they rise more rapidly in some
stores than in others. In September, a government price supervision
agency said a check of 325 shops turned up 300 different prices for
the same brand of suntan lotion.
   Comparison shopping has become a national pastime.
   Marcia Sobreira Evangelista, a 29-year-old lawyer, said
inflation forced her to atted the theater less often.
   So what does she do instead? ``I go to mall to see the prices.''
   When Collor's austerity plan froze most bank accounts, barter
became popular. Joao Alves do Brito, starting out as a dentist,
traded his 1981 Volkswagen Beetle for dental equipment.
   ``I was lucky,'' said Brito, 32. ``I avoided a big hassle of
getting cash, and who knows when the manufacturer would have
delivered the materials?''
   As inflation grows, so does the amount of time and energy spent
in coping with it.
   Sandra Ippolito Brunoro, 34-year-old manager of a Sao Paulo
office-lighting company, says she spends three hours a day reading
journals and newspaper business sections in an effort to keep her
money from losing value.
   ``You start thinking, `What'll be today - gold, dollars or
putting it into the stock market?' '' she said. ``It's incredibly
unproductive, but what choice do you have?''
   Computer analyst Sebastiao Freitas Gomes, 27, tries to beat the
system by shuffling money between bank and investment accounts.
   Every Friday afternoon, Gomes transfers money from his checking
account into a short-term ``overnight'' money market that pays 10
percent a month.
   ``It's tricky,'' he said, ``because you have to get to the bank
first thing on Monday to tranfer money back into your checking
account to cover the checks you wrote over the weekend.''
   Brazilians have turned to credit cards as a way to delay
payment. There is no finance charge when the total balance is paid
promptly, and using a card locks in prices that prevailed at the
time of purchase.
   Some merchants will not accept credit cards. Others follow the
illegal, but common, practice of charging credit customers 45
percent more than those who pay cash.

and court officials they cannot bribe or coerce.
   President Cesar Gaviria, inaugurated Aug. 7, plans ``fortress
cities'' where judges can live and work free of intimidation that
presents them with a choice of ``plata o plomo'' - money or lead.
   ``The country's powerful crime organizations are leaving the
judicial system in complete impotence,'' said Fernando Carrillo,
judicial adviser to Gaviria.
   An elite corps of ``untouchable'' - specialized judges,
policemen and lawyers - is to be created and given constant
military protection.
   Federal prosecutors, not judges, will investigate organized
crime and the identities of judges hearing cases will be concealed.
Judges now spend hundreds of hours gathering evidence.
   In nine years, 228 judges and other court officers have been
murdered in Colombia, according to the Judges' Union.
   Judges who stand up to the Medellin cartel run the greatest
risk. In July 1989, Judge Maria Helena Diaz and her two bodyguards
were killed in Bogota. She had issued an arrest warrant for Pablo
Escobar, head of the cocaine cartel.
   Twelve judicial workers were murdered in January 1989 while
investigating massacres of peasants in northern Colombia.
   In both cases, the government blamed paramilitary death squads
paid by the drug barons.
   Marta Restrepo, a regional attorney general, and her bodyguard
were shot to death in July in Apartado, a northern banana-growing
region. She was investigating the massacre of 42 peasants, in which
suspicion also fell on the death squads.
   When the Medellin cartel declared war on the government in
August 1989, then-President Virgilio Barco figured he had no choice
but to resume extraditions to the United States.
   ``The cartel had the government against the wall,'' said
Attorney General Alfonso Gomez. ``Magistrates were receiving
coffins in their homes as death threats. There was no way they
could have tried these cases freely in Colombia.''
   Drug gangs have been blamed in the past year for the killings of
550 Colombians, but recently declared a unilateral cease-fire.
   President Gaviria revised the extradition policy with a decree
Sept. 5 that drug traffickers who surrender can be tried in
Colombia instead of being sent to the United States. He also
announced the judicial reforms.
   In making the extradition offer and proposing reforms, Gaviria
sought to show the Colombian people the government was
strengthening its own institution rather than relying on foreign
governments, a policy-making official told The Associated Press.
   ``We cannot construct an anti-terrorism policy based on the
justice system of the United States,'' he said, on condition of
anonymity.
   Extraditions are unpopular and many Colombians consider them an
insult to the country. Colombia is unable to keep traffickers in
jail, however, and extraditions are likely to continue until the
courts can function properly.
   ``As long as no other clear alternative exists, we'll still have
extraditions,'' said Jorge Orlando Melo, president of the Institute
of Political Studies in Bogota.
   Barco asked the United States last year to help provide physical
protection for judges. The Bush administration sent bulletproof
vests and armored cars as part of a $65 million aid package for the
drug war.
   A high judicial official said, also on condition of anonymity:
``A few vests and cars? With this you protect an entire institution
from the most powerful mafia in the world?''
   He said the United States should offer to train judicial
workers, and added that Colombia needs money to build
maximum-security prisons.
   On Sept. 18, a man accused of murdering a leading presidential
candidate escaped from La Picota, the most heavily guarded prison
in Bogota.
   Jaime Rueda, believed to be in charge of explosives for the
Medellin cartel, was one of three suspects in the murder of Liberal
Party candidate Luis Carlos Galan, whose death led to the year-old
drug war.
   Four years ago, Honduran trafficker Juan Ramon Matta walked out
of La Picota, passing through 17 doors that were supposed to be
locked.
   Inefficiency plagues Colombia's judicial system.
   For example, the Supreme Court president must personally appoint
drivers to take court officers to and from their homes. ``This is
madness,'' said Carrillo, the presidential adviser.
   Under the Gaviria plan, the executive branch will coordinate the
judicial system.
   Federal prosecutors, working with the police and attorney
general, will collect evidence and press charges. Judges, who now
gather evidence and act as prosecutors, will be limited to deciding
guilt or innocence.
   Of Colombia's 5,000 judges, only 200 to 500 living in the
``fortress cities'' will hear cases related to drugs or terrorism,
officials say.
   Computers and evidence-collecting techniques are to be
modernized, and the government is may establish a special corps of
the 100 top judicial police.
   Carrillo said the reforms will cost the equivalent of $190
million, about 3 percent of the national budget, and take 18
months. Some changes will require constitutional amendments and
others will need congressional approval.
   Colombian governments have talked of reforming the judiciary
since the 1970s, ``but only now does there exist the political will
to do so,'' Carrillo said.

<HEAD>`Nixon,' A PBS Biography, Falls Short of The Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He telephoned the first men on the moon. He
opened the door to China. And, in 1974, he became the only
president to resign from office under the certainty of impeachment
and the likelihood of conviction.
   It's 1990 now, and Richard M. Nixon is tanned, rested, ready and
rehabilitated. And ``Nixon,'' a three-hour documentary, is opening
the season Monday for ``The American Experience'' series on PBS.
   It's a comprehensive biography of the 37th U.S. president,
even-handed, well-researched, full of good photographs and familiar
footage. Unfortunately, Nixon and his immediate family did not
cooperate in the making of the film.
   ``Nixon'' makes fine viewing for someone born since 1969, for
whom Nixon is ancient history, but it won't satisfy those who lived
during his prime.
   Nixon has been a national figure since 1948, when the young
California congressman made headlines by bird-dogging Alger Hiss'
alleged Communist ties before the House Un-American Activities
Committee.
   ``Nixon'' fails to show how his character led to the ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' that toppled him for concealing his
government's ties to the June 1972 botched break-in at Democratic
offices in the Watergate complex.
   Interviews with Nixon historians and biographers cannot
illuminate the labyrinth of Nixon's character. As historian James
MacGregor Burns has noted elsewhere, ``Nixon was not merely
complex, he was opaque.''
   ``Nixon'' tells of a boy born to a lower middle-class family,
with an unsuccessful father and a distant, dominating mother. Two
brothers died at an early age. Richard was smart, serious, a gifted
actor and debater.
   Whittier College, Duke University Law School and World War II
service in the Navy followed. In 1946, Nixon ousted Rep. Jerry
Voorhis, D-Calif., by claiming he was communist-supported.
Anonymous phone calls said worse.
   In 1950, he beat Helen Gahagan Douglas for the U.S. Senate with
an equally sleazy red-baiting campaign. There is a 1979 interview
with Douglas, who died the next year. Her revenge was the nickname
that haunts him still: ``Tricky Dick.''
   His next political leap nearly undid him. Fresh on the 1952 GOP
ticket as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president, he attacked
Democratic corruption and immediately was accused of having a
secret slush fund. He denied everything.
   He bypassed the press in the so-called ``Checkers speech''
televised to the nation. He spoke of his children, his wife, Pat,
and her ``Republican cloth coat,'' and the family dog, Checkers. It
saved his place on the ticket.
   ``Nixon'' uses footage from the Checkers speech and Nixon's
first televised debate with John F. Kennedy in the 1960
presidential race. And it shows the embittered Nixon in 1962, after
losing a bid for governor of California.
   ``You won't have Nixon to kick around any more,'' he told
reporters, ``because, gentlemen, this is my last press
conference.'' Six years later, ``the new Nixon'' won the presidency
and inherited the divisive Vietnam war.
   His attempts to end the war - diplomatic initiatives, stepped-up
bombing and ``Vietnamization'' of the ground war - divided the
nation even further.
   The Watergate era is the best and final hour of ``Nixon.'' We
get to see the brooding still photos of Nixon bunkered in the White
House and the speech that claims the support of a ``great, silent
majority.''
   The film shows how the White House, perceiving political
opposition to the war as subversion, compiled an ``enemies list,''
used by the FBI, CIA and IRS to attack its foes, and created an
extralegal ``Plumbers'' unit to stop leaks.
   And then there was the Watergate break-in. But for Washington
Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein (uncredited by name
in ``Nixon''), the president and his men might have gotten away
with it.
   As it was, the reporters found a ``massive campaign of political
spying and sabotage'' that led straight to the White House and
triggered our nation's greatest constitutional crisis.
   There are excellent interviews with cheerful, expansive former
aides, including John Ehrlichman, John Dean, and Charles Colson,
who did time for Watergate crimes, and speechwriter Ray Price.
   ``Nixon'' ultimately fails because of its ending: There is the
damaged man, ascending the helicopter steps, the sudden, agonized
wave, the embarrassing, awkward V-signs. It's still painful to
witness his departure into exile.
   But he didn't stay there. And the film neglects to mention his
miraculous ``rehabilitation'' as elder statesman for the Republican
Party. That omission only emphasizes the obvious: History is not
yet done with Richard Nixon.

   Consumers who opt for bottled water over tap
water might be surprised to learn that their preferred drink could
be drawn from the source they want to avoid - their public water
supply.
   Some water lovers may already know this, particularly those who
live in a state like California that requires bottled water labels
to disclose the source.
   But in areas that depend largely on federal regulations to
ensure the quality of their bottled water, consumers may find
little more than a brand name and a picture of a pristine mountain
lake on the label.
   ``They're selling a lot of bottled water because it is believed
to be better and purer and safer, but that's not necessarily so.
All it has to be is as good as tap water,'' said Edward Zadjura,
who is overseeing a General Accounting Office study on bottled
water regulations.
   ``You can have the mountain in the background, but you just
can't say it comes from a mountain or a lake if it doesn't,'' he
said. ``You can let the public's mind and imagination wander where
it wants.''
   He also notes that ``people overlook the fact that springs can
be as polluted as anything else.''
   The GAO study was requested by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee, after traces of benzene was found in Perrier bottled
water.
   The bottled water industry, which favors source labeling, is
careful not to make claims of the relative safety of bottled vs.
tap water. ``The reason people buy bottled water is because of the
taste,'' said William Deal, executive vice president of the
International Bottled Water Association.
   But is it safer?
   ``The answer is sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't,'' said
Herbert Allen, an environmental engineer at the University of
Delaware, who helped conduct a 1981 study of domestic and imported
mineral waters.
   The study, the results of which were published last year, found
that 24 of the 37 brands tested exceeded U.S. drinking water
standards for at least one chemical.
   But a recent Food and Drug Administration sampling of 50
imported and 50 domestic brands of bottled water found ``very
little reason for concern,'' said FDA spokesman Chris Lecos.
   The Environmental Protection Agency sets drinking water
standards in the United States, and these must be followed by
municipal water suppliers. Bottled water, however, is the
responsibility of the FDA, which generally adopts the EPA
standards.
   If there is a taste difference, the reason is chlorine: it's
added to public water supplies to eliminate bacteria. Bottled water
doesn't contain chlorine - either it wasn't added in the first
place, or it was taken out.
   Often when the source of a bottled water is the public water
supply, the chlorine and other possible organic and inorganic
substances have been removed.
   Municipal water suppliers feel they've been taking unwarranted
hits from the bottled water industry.
   ``If the consumer thinks they like the taste of bottled water,
that's fine,'' said Jack Hoffbuhr, deputy executive director of the
American Water Works Association. ``We just don't want them to be
scared into buying it.''
   ``We want the public to know the tap water is safe and they
don't need to pay $1 a gallon or more for this product, unless they
want to,'' he said.

<HEAD>The New, Unusual and Contradictory Economics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new economics now on display in Congress is
confusing millions of Americans who were brought up on a more or
less standard brand of the art that everyone understood.
   It included government actions to smooth wrinkles in the
economic cycle - maintaining an equilibrium between supply and
demand and avoiding inflation and recession. Economic growth was
good, stagnation was to be avoided.
   Now they aren't sure. The new economics, they fear, belongs to
no school at all, and, say the wags, isn't likely ever to gain
admittance to a school. It appears instead to be a conglomeration
of conflicts and contradictions.
   Those brought up in the practical school of economics over the
past half century accepted the idea that government intervention
was sometimes acceptable to control an economy from growing too
weakly or too strongly.
   Booms and busts were to be avoided. You avoided booms by raising
interest rates and maybe taxes, and by controlling federal
spending; you averted recessions by lowering taxes and interest
rates, and maybe by spending more.
   The new economics now on display in Washington seems to be a
different and so far unidentifiable brand, since it would raise
taxes and avowedly slow federal spending while the country heads
toward recession.
   It is also accompanied by a monetary policy - a Federal Reserve
policy - that appears to be more concerned with inflation than
recession, and that has resisted pleas by businesses and investors
for easier money.
   Yes, it's confusing, and it may be little solace to people to
realize that many members of the professional economic fraternity
are as confused as anyone. Negatives abound, they say, and more
taxes might make them worse.
   Among the negatives:
   Economic expansion, if it still exists, has slowed to a crawl
and may soon go into reverse. Consumer confidence is at its lowest
since the 1982 recession. Unemployment is growing steadily.
Manufacturing activity is stalling.
   Small businesses are complaining of a credit crunch.
Bankruptcies are rising Banks are failing. Important insurers are
endangered because their real estate portfolios have collapsed.
Household, business and government debt is high.
   The securities markets are in serious trouble; junk bonds are
defaulting and the stock market has plunged, erasing not just
billions of dollars but literally trillions from portfolios around
the world in August and September.
   Had such a situation occurred in the past it most likely would
have been countered by calls for propping up the economy through
tax relief, lower interest rates and conceivably some pump-priming
by the federal government.
   Today, the economy seem to be caught in a vicious political
debate that obscures the issues. It has no sponsor, no spokesman,
no outspoken defender. Those who might have accepted the role are
too busy with the budget.
   The Federal Reserve, which handles monetary policy, has
indicated that interest-rate relief might be forthcoming if budget
negotiators reach an acceptable agreement. But what if they don't?
   Meanwhile, government activity as a percentage of gross national
product is likely to grow by default of the private sector. Taxes
as a percent of gross national product could rise to 19.5 percent,
close to a post-World War II high.
   The last two times that government revenues accounted for so
much of GNP the economy fell into recession, and that is the
expectation expressed today in a growing number of published
forecasts.

<HEAD>Wilder Agitating for Tougher Democratic Stand on Deficits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder has changed many
things in more than two decades in politics.
   He was the first black elected to the Virginia Senate since
Reconstruction.
   He became the nation's first elected black governor.
   Now the rising political star wants to change the national
Democratic Party. He is chipping away at bedrock Democratic
doctrine in a quest to redefine it in more fiscally conservative
terms.
   Wilder fired a broadside at his own party that sounded almost
Reaganesque in its denunciation of tax increases.
   ``A backroom tax deal'' stacked against the middle class, Wilder
said of a quickly defeated federal deficit-reduction package. He
criticized Democratic national chairman Ron Brown for endorsing it.
   In speeches and a recent interview, the governor describes
himself as the personification of a ``new mainstream'' style of
politics that blends fiscal conservativism with social activism.
   It helped get him elected governor, made him a hot commodity for
speaking engagements around the country and - some say - could help
put him on the national Democratic ticket in 1992.
   And now, he seems to be playing the role of outsider in a
not-so-subtle campaign to gain an inside track on 1992.
   The next successful Democratic presidential candidate will be
someone ``who can identify with the totality of the American
public, and have shown soee degree of fiscal responsibility,'' says
Wilder.
   He says he plans to serve his full term of governor, which ends
in 1994. But others aren't so sure.
   Wilder ``knows he's got one shot at national office, and just
about everything he does in the state is geared to that,'' says
Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.
   Wilder risks alienating many of his strongest supporters by
trying to wipe out a $1.4 billion state deficit solely through
spending cuts.
   Civil rights and labor groups have been somewhat disenchanted
with his performance so far, he concedes.
   ``The only special interest that I recognize is the people of
Virginia,'' he says in defending his approach. The political heat
is likely to get worse when he discloses details of the planned
cuts.
   Wilder concedes his record in Richmond will be ``like a
fingerprint'' if he seeks national office, but he minimizes
speculation that he's positioning himself for a place on the
national party ticket.
   The governor said ``I didn't include myself'' when talking about
the type of Democrat he believes can return the party to the White
House.
   Still, in his first six months in office, he visited 11 states,
including the early presidential sweepstakes states of New
Hampshire and Iowa. He has injected himself on the national scene,
asking President Bush to appoint an independent commission to
investigate the savings and loan bailout and has expressed support
for Israel.
   He also has gotten some unwanted publicity: Using a state
helicopter to take personal trips with Patricia Kluge, estranged
wife of America's richest man, John W. Kluge.
   At times, Wilder acts like a political outsider, raising
eyebrows in the party establishment. He made waves with his blast
at Brown on the deficit-reduction package.
   ``It is becoming more apparent than ever before that our
two-party system is becoming a competition between the party inside
Washington and that new party, the vast majority of Americans who
live outside, who see the need to unite to protect their
interests,'' Wilder wrote. He assailed both parties for ``fiscal
irresponsibility,'' drawing criticism in return.
   Wilder ``would have been better off'' to be speaking in support
of any Washington budget package that was intended to curb the huge
deficit, responded former Democratic Party chairman Robert Strauss.
   ``I think people all over are looking for answers and
solutions,'' said former chairman Paul Kirk, ``and they can ally
with anyone who says something is wrong. But the toughest part is
to say what the solution is.''
   Wilder winces when asked whether he could be compared to House
Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, who has established a record as a
GOP maverick. Like Wilder, Gingrich loudly denounced higher taxes
as a solution for federal deficits.
   ``I'm not familiar with Newt Gingrich's politics,'' Wilder said.
``One of the things I think differs is that I've shown I can work
with people from both sides, with all segments. There isn't the
schism that follows me, that follows him.''
   Former Democratic Party chairman Charles Manatt says the next
presidential candidate must be a fiscal moderate because Americans,
``be they black, white or brown,'' aren't going to step up ``in
favor of higher taxes.''
   According to political scientist Sabato, Wilder ``understands
that a conservative, white Democrat would not be nominated by a
party where the selection process is dominated by liberals.
   ``But he also knows that a black conservative could not be
opposed by liberals. It wouldn't be in their constitution to be
against that,'' Sabato concludes.
   Wilder has a point in suggesting that the Democratic Party must
nominate a fiscal moderate or conservative next time around,
Strauss says.
   ``But it isn't just Doug Wilder saying it,'' Strauss said. ``Stu
Eizenstat, a liberal, has been saying it. I've been saying it.
(Georgia Sen.) Sam Nunn has been saying it. I think we're all
singing from the same hymn book.''
   Kirk said: ``I don't disagree at all with what he's suggesting
as the type of candidate the party needs. It's just easier said
than done.''
   Wilder's ``new mainstream'' style follows two decades in which
he adhered to liberal principles while climbing the ladder of
Virginia politics.
   His father was a clerk at a black insurance company. His mother
cared for the eight children. The family was poor enough that they
had to stuff their shoes with newspaper.
   Wilder was elected to the Virginia Senate nearly 21 years ago,
the first black since Reconstruction. He promptly asked for
replacement of the official state song, noting that its lyrics
extol plantation life under ``old Massa.''
   He became one of the most influential senators in the
Legislature, shepherding an array of anti-discrimination laws and
winning a long battle to declare a holiday honoring Martin Luther
King. He won the lieutenant governorship in 1985, after rejecting
the pleas of white party leaders to pull out. They feared he would
sink the ticket headed by Gerald Baliles. He won the governorship
in 1989 by emphasizing his pro-choice stand on abortion.
   Wilder prizes political experience.
   It would be ``awfully difficult'' for someone like Jesse Jackson
to get on the ticket without ``some prior life'' in high public
office, Wilder says. He did not support Jackson's bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 or 1988.
   A pragmatist, Wilder says unsuccessful Democratic presidential
candidates, starting with Hubert Humphrey, couldn't win in today's
atmosphere of soaring budget deficits. He says:
   - George McGovern's positions on foreign policy and defense
likely would be considered too soft.
   - Walter F. Mondale is ``eminently qualified to be president''
but was perceived as too beholden to Democratic Party constituent
groups.
   - Michael Dukakis didn't react aggressively to Bush's negative
advertising, and probably lost the 1988 presidential election
because of it.
   Wilder has said he foresees a black president in the ``not too
distant'' future. Many people think he has himself in mind.

   One candidate awaits a verdict on
excommunication. Another fights to stay in a religious group she
helped found. Four find themselves out of work, rejected by voters.
   All of them are Roman Catholic and all of them are paying a
price for their positions on abortion - no matter which side
they're on.
   Hold to the church teaching that abortion is murder, and a
candidate risks learning the hard way that many voters think
otherwise. Support a woman's right to an abortion, and the
politician may become a pariah in his or her own parish.
   Several recent incidents illustrate the clash between religion
and politics:
   - Jim Moran, the mayor of Alexandria, Va., and a pro-choice
Democratic candidate for Congress, skipped communion three times.
``I didn't want to challenge my pastor and members of the church
who would feel upset if a confrontation developed,'' he explained.
The local bishop is weighing a request to excommunicate Moran.
   - Catholic abortion rights supporters defeated anti-abortion
Catholics in four Maryland state Senate primaries. Veteran state
Sen. Frank Shore, an ardent abortion foe, said the voters
disappointed him. ``I thought if they knew my opponent was a
Catholic for death and I was a Catholic for life, they would
respond,'' he said. ``Nobody responded.''
   - State Rep. Mary Boergers, who defeated Shore in the Democratic
primary, has stopped speaking at Catholic high schools and keeps a
low profile to protect her pastor. She's being thrown out of a
Catholic scientists' group she helped found. ``You can say you are
where the voters are, but you pay a personal price,'' Boergers
says.
   The price for Catholics, both personal and political, has risen
since the Supreme Court's 1989 decision giving states more latitude
to restrict abortion. The ruling turned abortion rights into a
winning issue in some races and, at the same time, put increased
pressure on Catholic public officials.
   Last October, Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., had the names of all
Catholic members of Congress with pro-choice voting records
published in the Congressional Record.
   ``They never have to pay any price,'' Dornan declared on the
House floor. ``There are 352 active bishops and they never lean on
the self-proclaimed Catholics in this House who say, `I personally
believe it is a human being with an immortal soul, a child in the
womb, but go ahead and kill it and I'll help you pay for it.' ''
   Just days later, bishops meeting in Baltimore declared abortion
``the fundamental human rights issue.'' The bishops said no
responsible Catholic could be pro-choice, and urged all public
officials - ``especially Catholics'' - to seek laws limiting
abortions.
   And last June, Cardinal John O'Connor in New York warned that
Catholics who promote pro-choice legislation or make public funds
available for abortion are at risk of excommunication. It is ``the
only option'' if such actions persist, he said.
   Richard Doerflinger, associate director of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops' anti-abortion office, disagrees
there has been any escalation of pressure on Catholics in public
life since the Baltimore meeting.
   ``I don't know of any Catholic politician who's been criticized
for failure to toe the line with an absolute position on this,'' he
said.
   However, Catholics for a Free Choice cites dozens of incidents
over the past year. Among the group's examples:
   - Montana bishops confronted four state officials over their
pro-choice stands.
   - A diocesan newspaper in Providence, R.I., banned the
publication of Christmas greetings from politicians who had not
signed a statement saying abortion should be constitutionally
banned.
   - Two candidates for the Pennsylvania Legislature were dismissed
from church positions because they favored abortion rights.
   - Pro-choice legislators were forbidden to talk to parochial
school students in South Kingston, R.I., and Yonkers, N.Y.
   In one of the best known cases, a California bishop denied
communion to state Senate candidate Lucy Killea because she
supported abortion rights. Killea went on to win a special election
and tip the chamber to a pro-choice majority. Her opponent blamed
the church, saying Killea had been elevated to martyr and celebrity
status.
   The Killea case was by no means an isolated case of backlash
against the church, and the David-vs.-Goliath phenomenon has not
been lost on church elders.
   ``The bishops are becoming more aware of that,'' said
Doerflinger. ``It's an additional reason to be very, very cautious
about anything that seems to be a church penalty against a public
figure.''
   Doerflinger said some campaign consultants actually advise
pro-choice candidates to try to provoke a negative reaction from
the church. Shore, the Maryland loser, takes a similarly cynical
view of his pro-choice brethren.
   ``At candidate forums the first thing they holler is `I'm
choice, I'm choice.' I think they're trying to read the tea
leaves,'' Shore said. ``I was willing to take that chance in
defense of the unborn. . . . I would do exactly the same thing
today if I had it to do over again.''
   Some observers believe the church may be creating a problem that
transcends individual victories or losses.
   ``There is a fear that the bishops could actually create an
anti-Catholic climate in the electorate,'' said Frances Kissling,
president of Catholics for a Free Choice. She said voters could
come to view Catholic politicians as puppets of the church and
distrust their ability to put broader interests first.
   That raises an issue many Catholics thought had been laid to
rest 30 years ago, when John F. Kennedy won the presidency.
   One candidate even paraphrased Kennedy to demonstrate his
independence.
   ``I am not the Catholic candidate for Congress,'' Rhode Island
Democrat John Reed said earlier this month. ``I am a candidate for
Congress who happens to be Catholic.''

^Legendary Collection Becoming More Accessible</NOTE>

   It may be the greatest art museum you never
heard of.
   There is no sign outside the Barnes Foundation, just a small
framed notice on a gate to a Main Line mansion that is hidden
behind towering trees and dense rhododendron.
   Those who sign in at the gatehouse and pay $1 inside the door
step into a world of Renoir, Cezanne and Matisse that makes art
lovers weak in the knees.
   ``It's a staggering collection,'' says New York art collector
and dealer Richard L. Feigan. ``It's one of the legendary
repositories of masterpieces of post-impressionists in the world.''
   ``They have more Cezannes than the Met, the National Gallery and
Chicago combined, and they're all very high quality,'' says Gary
Tinterow, associate curator of European painting at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
   ``The collection is unrivaled,'' adds Charles E. Stuckey, modern
art curator at the Art Institute of Chicago.
   That collection - including 171 Renoirs, 57 Cezannes, 54
Matisses, 19 Picassos and several paintings by van Gogh, Seurat,
Degas and Rousseau - is probably worth more than $1 billion.
   ``There's an embarrassment of choice, there are so many great
things,'' said Marco Grassi, a curator in New York. ``It should be
one of the musts on everyone's tour of great things to see in
America.''
   But the foundation is open just 2{ days a week - all day Friday
and Saturday and Sunday afternoon - and is closed most of the
summer. Paintings are not sold or lent out, and color reproductions
- slides or prints - are forbidden.
   The collection and the restrictions are the legacy of scientist
and inventor Dr. Albert C. Barnes, who established the foundation
in 1922. According to a plan he laid out shortly before his death
at 79 in 1951, control of the foundation has shifted to Lincoln
University, a largely black college in the Chester County town of
Lincoln University.
   The change has art scholars hoping for a more open policy at the
foundation.
   ``It's phenomenal and wonderful and we all like it,'' said Tom
Freudenheim, assistant secretary for museums at the Smithsonian
Institution. ``But it's idiosyncratic.''
   That's why so many outside the art world haven't heard of the
Barnes Foundation, which is not, as Barnes stressed, a museum, but
an educational institution, offering classes in art appreciation.
   Barnes was an eccentric, brilliant scientist who invented an
antiseptic, Argyrol, a mild silver protein that fights infection,
made a fortune and bought art - great art - in bunches in the early
20th century, sometimes an entire studio-full at once.
   Among the treasures: ``Les Grandes Poseuses'' by Seurat; ``Le
Bonheur de Vivre'' by Matisse; and ``The Card Players and Girl'' by
Cezanne.
   Barnes feuded with the art establishment, barring critics, art
historians and museum officials and most of the general public from
his galleries. After his death, members of the public were allowed
to enter - if they made a reservation.
   Slowly, things are changing. The reservations-only restriction
was lifted a few years ago, as was a limit of 450 visitors a day.
And foundation officials have been talking with museums about
modern gallery practices - something Barnes avoided.
   ``Prior to this, the Barnes Foundation was considered nearly an
eccentricity and made no attempt to become part of the art world,''
said Feigan, who is on the Lincoln University board of trustees.
   Barnes put the paintings on the walls of the mansion in crowded
symmetrical arrangements. One wall holds 24 canvases - Picassos and
Matisses surrounding a Modigliani. A single small room contains
more than 30 Renoirs.
   ``Museums tend to be carbon copies,'' said Freudenheim of the
Smithsonian. ``It's nice to have a place with real personality. I
think the idea of a collector's personality shining through is a
nice thing. It's full of masterpieces. It's extraordinary.''
   The arrangements - as well as the pieces of decorative iron
hardware stuck on the walls and the antique furniture in the rooms
- are essential elements in Barnes' art education program.
   That program teaches the scientific analysis of painting, what
Barnes felt was an objective way to judge composition, color and,
in the end, quality.
   ``Art appreciation can no more be absorbed by aimless wandering
in galleries than can surgery be learned by casual visits to a
hospital,'' a foundation pamphlet says.
   A host of publications are available at the foundation,
explaining the Barnes way of looking at things and reflecting his
quirks. One pamphlet by Violette de Mazia, education director until
her death in September at the age of 89, was titled: ``The Lure and
Trap of Color Slides in Art Education,'' and subtitled, ``The
Time-Released Venom of Their Make-Believe.''
   ``He acted more crazy than he was,'' Feigan said. ``If you look
at it, the man was brilliant. The kind of masterpieces he bought
could only be bought by someone with an acute eye and brilliant
judgment.''
   That judgment wasn't infallible. Experts say numerous paintings
that Barnes bought as old masters are merely copies.
   Barnes was long interested in African art - he amassed an
impressive collection - and friendly with Lincoln University's
president. He amended a trust indenture nine months before his
death to allow the school to select foundation trustees as the
original trustees retired or died. By 1988, Lincoln-named trustees
were in the majority.
   Don't expect things to change.
   ``First and foremost, we intend to be very faithful to the
indenture and we intend to ensure that the foundation is able to
carry out its mission as envisioned by Dr. Barnes,'' said Richard
Glanton, president of the foundation.
   ``I'd like to emphasize that no quick changes will be
implemented, if any at all, simply because the character and
personality of the institution is a very delicate thing.''
   However, Stuckey of Chicago's Art Institute, thinks hours should
be lengthened and catalogs published with color reproductions. ``If
someone called me up today and offered a decent salary to do a
catalog, I'd be packing my bags today,'' he said.
   Said the Met's Tinterow, who was consulted by the trustees,
``They are very well equipped to usher the Barnes into the next
century and maintain it as it is, which is jewel of a collection
which represents the ideals and tastes of a remarkable man.''

<TEXT>
   Metromedia Co. founder John W. Kluge, the
wealthiest man in America, credits much of his success to plain old
gambling and good luck.
   ``The greatest factor in my life - and I know entrepreneurial
people don't want to express it, they think it diminishes them -
but luck plays a large part,'' Kluge told Forbes magazine in a
rare, recent interview.
   The 76-year-old Kluge (pronounced kloogy) is worth an estimated
$5.6 billion, making him the richest man in the country, according
to Forbes. The Forbes 400 ranking released last Monday marked the
second straight year Kluge topped the list. Last year, the magazine
estimated his worth at $5.2 billion.
   While many successful men are driven by money, Kluge is not,
said his estranged wife, Patricia.
   ``John was a pioneer - he wasn't particularly a man who wanted
to be rich or enjoy a grand life,'' Mrs. Kluge, 41, told The
Washingtonian magazine in an interview published in August.
   ``He was more an intellectual businessman than a money-making
businessman,'' she said. ``He was more challenged by the creation
of new ideas and new markets against all odds . . . He took a small
idea and turned it into something grand.''
   Friends and colleagues also describe the stocky, balding Kluge
as friendly and down-to-earth.
   ``He's just a regular guy,'' said Alson H. Smith, who has known
the Kluges since they moved to Virginia in 1982. ``He'll talk about
anything you want to talk about.''
   Kluge, born in Germany, came to the United States in 1922 at age
8. The son of an engineer, he and his family settled in Detroit,
and for a time he worked on a Ford assembly line.
   During the Depression, Kluge enrolled in Columbia University and
earned an economics degree in 1937. He worked in Army intelligence
during World War II.
   At Columbia, Kluge told Forbes, he was a gambler, often playing
cards well into the night to help earn money for school. ``I came
out of college with $7,000,'' he said.
   Kluge got into broadcasting after the war, buying his first
radio station in 1946. Later he expanded into television, and his
holdings, Metromedia Broadcasting, eventually grew into seven TV
stations and 14 radio stations. The TV stations eventually became
the foundation of Fox Television.
   Business wasn't always smooth. In the early 1980s, Metromedia
was taking a beating on Wall Street.
   Kluge, convinced his properties were worth much more, decided to
go private by buying out public shares. He warned his wife of tight
financial times ahead, but by her own account, she wasn't
sympathetic.
   ``There was no buildup for this thing. I was stunned, as any
wife would be,'' she said. ``And I said: `Why don't you have a
fortune? All those people lesser than you certainly don't have your
brain and your vision, but they have fortunes.' ''
   When he told her it had never been important for him to become
rich, she shot back, ``Damn it, it is now!'' The Kluges had just
adopted a son, John W. Kluge II.
   ``Go out and become a billionaire, and don't come back until you
are,'' she said she told her husband. ``And he did.''
   Kluge had met Patricia Rose, the Baghdad-born daughter of a
British father and Scottish-Iraqi mother, at a dinner party in
1976. She was divorced from Russell Gay, publisher of the British
men's magazine Knave, which had run nude photographs of her.
   She and Kluge were married in 1981, he for the third time.
   ``What attracted me was his brilliance,'' she said. ``I was
absolutely knocked out by his ability to achieve whatever he wanted
to achieve.''
   The reclusive Kluge declined to be interviewed by The Associated
Press.
   After the highly leveraged buyout that gave him all of
Metromedia, Kluge sold off the pieces for $4.65 billion, according
to Forbes, and personally netted more than $1.6 billion.
   ``I felt that television was going to change,'' Kluge told
Forbes of the selloff. ``I just thought that it was going to get
more competitive.''
   Since then, Kluge has invested his profits in other interests,
including cellular telephones and restaurants. He owns the
Ponderosa Steak House, Bonanza and Steak &amp; Ale chains. He recently
sold his New York cellular operations for more than $1 billion in
cash and $850 million in stock.
   Kluge plays his business deals as close to the vest as he plays
his cards.
   ``Whenever I have a plan, I keep it really very much to myself,
because I make changes in my own mind,'' he said. ``It's been a
habit of mine to do that, not because I don't want to look like I
don't make mistakes - I make mistakes all the time - but rather so
that people around me don't feel that every five minutes I'm
changing my mind.
   ``I have to work things out, and I sometimes change in the
middle of the course,'' he said.
   ``I think the ability to gauge risks is crucial. I never
ordinarily take on things that I can't see some end to, where you
pile risks on risks,'' he said.
   One of Kluge's lesser-known business ventures is cattle breeding
on his 10,000-acre Albemarle Farms estate in the shadow of
Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's home near Charlottesville, Va.
   Before the Kluges separated this spring, he balanced the week
between Virginia and his New York office, but now spends more time
in New York. In a 1986 broadcast interview, he said he moved to the
pastoral county near the Blue Ridge Mountains ``because it's a
place where the urban centers like Washington don't encroach.'' He
also owns 70,000 acres in Scotland.
   Mrs. Kluge will keep the 45-room Albemarle House mansion the
couple built on the Virginia estate plus a reported $1.5 million
weekly allowance. She serves on the governing board of nearby
University of Virginia.
   She and Kluge contributed $200,000 to Virginia Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder's campaign for election last November, and both served as
chairmen of Wilder's inauguration festivities in January.
   Since the separation, which by all accounts was amicable, Mrs.
Kluge has been romantically linked to the 59-year-old Democrat.
Wilder says only that he is friends with the Kluges.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   There is reason to believe the new Paul Simon
album won't be received as well as the double Grammy-winning
``Graceland.'' Still, ``Rhythm of the Saints,'' where South Africa
meets Brazil meets the U.S.A., was the next logical step.
   ``I think it's inevitable that people will compare this to
`Graceland.' You can make the comparison, but . . . It's relevant
in terms of what I took from `Graceland' and continued with in
this,'' the singer-songwriter said of his new release.
   ``In terms of do you like it more or less, that's up to people's
taste or opinion. Is it better? Is it worse? Time will tell. It's
really not my job to be deciding that, which is a break for me,
because I'm very critical.''
   ``Rhythm of the Saints,'' which will be in record stores on
Monday, is not the accessible, up-tempo romp of its predecessor. A
cultural melange that unites Brazilian drummers with African
musicians with American session players, ``Rhythm'' is a darker,
denser work than ``Graceland.''
   Simon said he enjoyed the project as much as the ``Graceland''
sessions, although he doesn't expect the response the previous
album generated.
   ``Phenomenons don't occur every time. I don't expect that this
is going to be a phenomenon,'' Simon said during an interview in
his Brill Building office. ``You don't set out to create a
phenomenon, you set out to create a piece of music.''
   Simon's immediate post-Graceland music had a different focus. He
recorded a duet with Brazilian singer Milton Nascimiento and
started work on an as yet unfinished Broadway musical (``It's not
pop music. It's a different kind of music, different periods of
time,'' he said of that project).
   There were other things to keep Simon busy - back-to-back
Grammys for ``Graceland,'' and his induction with old friend Art
Garfunkel into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
   ``Rhythm of the Saints'' began when Simon set off for Brazil in
March 1988, following the advice of Quincy Jones and Nascimiento
that he should check out the great drummers from around the world.
   Simon was immediately swept up in the sounds and began recording
drum tracks, including one done on an eight-track recorder in the
town square of a Brazilian village. Several trips south ensued,
with Simon finally getting to work full time on the record in May
1989.
   ``I thought I would be finished by fall '89. But, you know,
typically, I missed my deadline,'' said Simon, who was remixing and
resequencing the album up until two weeks ago.
   The album features the drum tracks mixed with some South African
players (Ladysmith Black Mambazo makes an appearance) and some
top-notch help from the United States: horn player Michael Brecker,
drummer Steve Gadd, guitarist J.J. Cale and accordionist C.J.
Chenier.
   Cajun veteran Chenier fit right in with the eclectic mix of
players, Simon said.
   ``I go back to the premise that the West African and Brazilian
cultures are connected, and likewise into Caribbean and into
Louisiana in the United States,'' said Simon. ``So you bring C.J.
Chenier, and you let him play, he finds a pocket.
   ``It's a little Louisiana groove, but it fits, because there are
those elements. I was dealing with a big arc of culture that
spanned thee different continents, so a lot of the stuff worked.''
   Brecker and Gadd will tour with Simon's 14-piece band later this
year - a group that will include four Brazilian percussionists.
   ``I was dealing with really extraordinary musicians. . . . It's
a privilege to get them,'' said Simon.
   While ``Graceland'' followed Simon's commercially disappointing
``Hearts and Bones,'' this album follows a certified smash. Simon
said he's not concerned about following up a multi-platinum effort.
   ``It's not the first big hit that I've had. It's not even the
first phenomenon that's occurred to me. I mean, `The Graduate' was
a big thing. `Bridge Over Troubled Water' sold twice as much as
`Graceland,' '' said Simon.
   `` `Still Crazy After All These Years' was the album of the
year. The concert in Central Park - about a half a million people.
So I've had big successes before, and I've had flops.''

   Nicaragua's health system is crumbling
under a load of economic chaos, shortages, corruption and
epidemics. Those who suffer most are the children.
   Diseases that were under control are returning. A measles
epidemic has killed hundreds of children this year.
   The rainy season brings the annual diarrhea epidemic and a host
of respiratory problems. Puddles of rainwater breed flies that
contaminate uncovered food. People have to drink unsafe water.
   Poverty deepens in range and scope. Malnutrition ravages small
bodies.
   Conditions are desperate at La Mascota Children's Hospital,
which has 240 beds and was built eight years ago.
   Dr. Adolfo Galan Ruiz, head of the emergency room, asked the
mother of a 9-year-old boy: ``Do you know how to pray?'' She
nodded, and he said: ``Then start praying.''
   The youngster had a leg infection and fever that began with an
insect bite. Because he was malnourished, the infection developed
into gangrene that threatened his life.
   Galan said malnutrition was the direct or indirect cause of more
than 40 percent of the deaths at La Mascota. Fifty-four children
died there in September, 67 in August and 118 in July.
   ``We have done what we can,'' Galan told the mother. ``The rest
is up to God.''
   Asked later whether he believed in God, he shrugged and said:
``No.''
   In three days, the boy was dead.

<HEAD>Bush to Voters: You're Sick and Tired of Washington Goings-On</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The voters, President Bush was telling a group of
them, are frustrated, outraged by what's going on in Washington,
sick and tired of smoke and mirrors that hide congressional
spending habits.
   It sounded like an often tested, seldom successful Republican
formula: campaign against Congress, where the Democratic majorities
are. This would seem to be a promising season for that message,
with signs of rising wrath about the government's inability to
manage its own budget.
   But the Bush message is tempered this time, with good reason.
   He'd like more Republicans elected to Congress on Nov. 6, but he
also needs Democratic support there, before election day, to get
the government out of its tax, spending and budget maze.
   ``Believe me, when you don't control either house of the United
States Congress, it ain't easy,'' the president told a Republican
fund-raising reception in Atlanta Wednesday night.
   And it gets worse for a White House that can't hold the
Republican minority together for a tax and spending settlement to
cut the deficit. Bush held a White House reception Thursday night
for ``select Republican House members,'' meaning the 71 who stuck
with him on a budget settlement. They were a minority of the House
minority - 105 Republicans bolted and helped kill the budget Bush
favored. No reception for them.
   ``It is an outrage what's happening up there,'' Bush said.
``Sucking up tax dollars on one end and turning them into spending
programs without end. And frankly, if we had more Republicans in
Congress, we wouldn't be in this mess.
   ``But I've got to work with the Democrats in Congress because I
was sent there to govern, not to give speeches about it . . . ,''
he said. ``We're outnumbered. We've got to get the Democrats to
come with us . . . .''
   In Bush's limited political warfare, he tells his off-year
campaign crowds that Congress is responsible for solving the
problem, and ought to get on with it to ``bring this ghastly
federal budget deficit to its knees.''
   ``I didn't come down here to assign blame,'' he said in St.
Petersburg, Fla., ``but you know . . . the American people are
pretty smart. They know where the action is. And they know that
Congress has the responsibility to pass a budget. And it's about
time that they met that responsibility.''
   That's tame stuff, matched against the traditions of
presidential campaigns against Congress. The classic was Harry S.
Truman's daily denunciation of ``the do-nothing 80th Congress'' in
1948, when Republicans were in control.
   Every Republican president since his time has had occasion to
campaign against Democratic Congresses, interrupted only by GOP
majorities in the Senate during Ronald Reagan's first six years.
   Dwight D. Eisenhower said congressional Democrats were gloom
merchants, ``men of little faith,'' bent on obstruction of programs
the people wanted. Reagan said if he couldn't make liberal
Democrats in Congress see the light, he would make them feel the
heat from the voters. ``Here's a flash from the Gipper - they're
not going to win,'' he said.
   Bush came to office pledging bipartisanship, saying he and
Congress weren't elected to bicker. That's still part of his
message, even at campaign rallies, and despite the confrontation
that is built into divided government.
   Bush has vetoed 14 bills this year, and hasn't been overridden
once. He's threatened a budget veto if he doesn't get satisfactory
terms by Friday, a move that could lead to a government shutdown.
``I have tried to negotiate in good faith with the liberals in the
Congress,'' he said at one southern campaign stop. ``And I believe
the American people didn't send me as president to play cheap
politics. They sent me up there to govern.''

<HEAD>Army Engineers Set To Fill Canal and Rebuild River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKEECHOBEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1984, the cameras rolled as Gov. Bob
Graham hefted the first shovelful of dirt in a historic project to
fill a canal and rebuild the river it replaced.
   The $340 million Kissimmee River restoration project is crucial
to the survival of the Everglades. If it succeeds, it will serve as
the model for similar projects around the country, authorities say.
   ``This is the headwaters of the Everglades system, and the
Everglades is probably the most endangered national park, closest
to the brink of environmental collapse,'' said Brien Culhane of the
Wilderness Society, who is chairman of the Everglades Coalition, a
network of 25 environmental groups.
   ``This is going to be the most ambitious riverine restoration
project ever attempted.''
   Graham's shovelful of dirt remains the only dirt moved so far.
But Congress is nearing final action on legislation to authorize
the project and appropriate $2 million to $6 million for the first
year of the decade-long project.
   After two decades of debate, final design work on the project
could begin next year.
   ``We've overcome the major hurdles,'' said Estus Whitfield,
environmental adviser to Graham and the present governor, Bob
Martinez.
   The aim is to undo a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood-control
project, a segmented canal that brought howls from
environmentalists even before it was completed in 1971.
   About half the 56 miles of canals will be filled to force water
back into the old river run and on to the surrounding flood plain.
   The project has forced state and federal officials to drop
rhetoric about saving the Everglades and to confront tough
questions: How much is ecological restoration worth? Is restoring
the Kissimmee River worth $340 million?
   So far, the answer has been yes. But the money hasn't yet been
spent, and the bills haven't come due.
   ``I think it's going to be a good test case as to whether
society is going to pay for these things,'' said Kent Loftin,
director of the Kissimmee River restoration project for the South
Florida Water Management District. ``And for whether technology is
going to be successful at modifying some of our past work more in
line with the way we'd like to have things today.''
   The Kissimmee River lies at the headwaters of the Everglades
system covering the southern third of Florida. The entire system is
a shallow sieve, filtering fresh water that bubbles southward from
the river through Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades wetlands to
the sea.
   Lake Okeechobee, the largest fresh-water lake in the United
States after the Great Lakes, covers 730 square miles but is only
12 feet deep. South of the lake, water moves through the Everglades
in a river 50 miles wide and six inches deep. Its chronicler, the
writer Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, called it a ``river of grass.''
   Before the Corps o Engineers bulldozed a channel through the
Kissimmee, it was a delicate, braided network of oxbows and
meandering tributaries that stretched about 100 miles from Lake
Kissimmee to Lake Okeechobee.
   The canals were intended to ease flooding along the river. And
they succeeded. But that was not all they accomplished.
   The Kissimmee's braided course is bordered by a flood plain that
was periodically inundated with water before the canal was
completed. ``That's what made the system so productive,'' said John
Wullschleger, a fisheries biologist with the Florida Game and
Freshwater Fish Commission in Okeechobee. ``It was almost like a
factory that produced birds and fish.''
   With the canal completed, the fish spawning grounds disappeared.
``Most of the year, the water sits in the canal,'' Wullschleger
said.
   ``People are encroaching into flood plain. Once they're there,
there's nothing you can do. A lot of the flood plain has been
turned into pasture rather than wetlands.''
   The 30-foot-deep canals are stagnant much of the year. The water
is poor in oxygen and can't support plants. Florida fish, adapted
to shallow water and aquatic plants, have declined dramatically.
   Without the gentle flow and filtering action of the wetlands,
agricultural pollutants that enter the river are eventually
deposited in Lake Okeechobee, the primary water source for
Florida's southeastern coast.
   In 1983, Graham, now a U.S. senator, inaugurated a
save-the-Everglades program that included a provision to somehow
restore the environmental values of the Kissimmee River.
   In 1985, the Corps of Engineers completed a report outlining
options for restoring the river, but under Reagan administration
policy, the economic benefits of the project had to outweigh the
costs.
   ``There were no quantifiable economic benefits,'' Lewis Hornung,
director of central and southern Florida projects for the corps,
said. ``So we concluded that there was no federal interest in
proceeding with the restoration project.''
   Meanwhile, the South Florida Water Management District had begun
its own research, including the construction of several weirs, or
dams, as part of a demonstration project to determine whether river
channels would recover if water were forced back into them.
   ``What we saw was good response from the old river channel to
having flow restored,'' Loftin said. ``We saw good response from
the flood plain from having it flooded seasonally.''
   By 1989, the water management district had decided to recommend
the most expensive restoration option. It provides for the complete
filling of 25 to 30 miles of the 56-mile canal and partial filling
of much of the remainder.
   The canals can't be entirely filled, because people have moved
into the flood plain along the upstream portion of the canal,
Loftin said.
   In January, Martinez endorsed that recommendation. The Corps of
Engineers has so far received $6.3 million for work on the
Kissimmee River.
   The first part of the project will cost $80 million, $30 million
in construction costs and $50 million to buy land in the flood
plain.
   Florida will be responsible for most of the land costs. It hopes
Congress will pay for most of the construction.
   Loftin said $9 million or $10 million is likely to be spent
during the next two or three years, depending upon the size of
congressional appropriations. The next step is approval of the
overall plan by the Corps of Engineers, expected early next year.
   ``If we got a project commitment at about that point in time, we
have all the necessary steps identified to begin the final round of
detail work that needs to be done,'' Loftin said. ``The major work
we feel could begin sometime in the middle of 1992.'' Land
acquisition has already begun.
   ``The Corps of Engineers has been touting that they're the new
environmental engineers of the 1990s. The Kissimmee project should
be their flagship,'' Culhane of the Everglades Coalition said.
   ``This will be looked at internationally as a model of ecosystem
restoration - that we can look at our past mistakes, that we have
the will, and wherewithal, to begin restoring natural systems where
we can.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - New projections by the Bush administration
show the fund insuring bank deposits shrinking to less than half
its current size within three years, a senior House Banking
Committee member said.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s fund for commercial banks
will lose $6.1 billion through fiscal 1993 even if the fees banks
pay for deposit insurance are increased, Rep. Frank Annunzio,
D-Ill., citing projections by the Office of Management and Budget
said Wednesday.
   The new estimates are sharply more pessimistic than the budget
office's previous projections. In June, the budget office had
estimated the FDIC would show a profit of $600 million over the
three-year period, Annunzio said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Buyout strategist Theodore Forstmann is seeking
investors for a $1.5 billion fund that would finance acquisitions
of companies by using debt, a source knowledgable about the
proposal said.
   The venture is likely to be watched by Wall Street as a
barometer of the market for debt-financed buyouts. Since the
collapse of the junk bond market a year ago, many investors have
shunned the idea of funding acquisitions primarily with debt.
   The source said Wednesday that Forstmann is planning to offer
investors in his fund yields 1 percent above the interest rate on
five-year Treasury bonds, which now yield about 8.5 percent.

   Epic takeover battles and soaring operating costs
might sound like a formula for failure but they haven't downed
United Airlines.
   But the carrier is beating the flaps off its competition and
many observers sum up United's success in two words: Pacific
expansion.
   Earlier this year it became the biggest carrier across the
Pacific Ocean, surpassing Japan Air Lines and Northwest Airlines.
   United's success comes despite two leadership changes and four
buyout bids in the last four years as well as an industry-wide
domestic business slump and a sharp increase in fuel prices.
   Parent company UAL Corp. rejected the latest employee
acquisition offer Tuesday, ending more than a year of constant
pressure on the company's board and management.
   But the stress never showed in the airline's performance.
   ``We all suspect it's been distracting but anybody who makes
that assertion is hard-pressed to support it,'' said Robert Decker,
an airline analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
   UAL had not yet resumed contract negotiations Wednesday with its
flight attendants, pilots and mechanics, said company spokeswoman
Sara Dornacker.
   The unions, which all are working under expired contracts,
pledged on Tuesday to ``pursue all means necessary'' to get
substantial improvements in wages and benefits.
   But United's revenues, market share and on-time performance have
actually improved since last year while passenger complaints and
mishandled-baggage reports are down.
   Profits have slipped - parent UAL Corp. reported net income of
$112 million for the first six months of 1990 compared with $207
million for the same period last year.
   And UAL earned $324 million for all of 1989 after posting record
profits of $1.1 billion in 1988. But analysts say the decline
reflects the condition of the entire U.S. airline industry.
   For the first nine months of this year, United's trans-Pacific
revenue passenger miles - the number of miles flown by paying
customers - totaled 15.3 billion, a 32 percent increase over the
same period last year.
   The surge in Pacific business compares with a 3.4 percent
increase in United's North American business for the first nine
months of 1990.
   Pacific travel now accounts for 24 percent of United's business.
That share is likely to grow as the airline adds to the 755 flights
it now makes each week across the ocean, said United spokesman Joe
Hopkins.
   Chicago-based United has been taking delivery of one new plane
per week in recent months, mostly to replace aging aircraft in its
domestic fleet. But the airline also has received six long-range
Boeing 747-400s in the past year to expand its trans-Pacific fleet,
and will soon announce a large order for wide-bodied jetliners for
international travel, Hopkins said.
   The Pacific expansion, directed by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf,
has given United a slight edge over arch-rival American Airlines in
monthly revenue passenger miles since June. As of September, United
still trailed American in year-to-date business but appeared likely
to become the undisputed largest U.S. airline by year-end.
   Trans-Pacific business also has been a boon to United's bottom
line because long-distance routes are the most profitable an
airline can fly.
   A long flight allows an airline to spread fixed costs such as
food and labor over a greater number of miles, reducing the cost
per mile.
   And the laws of supply and demand allow airlines to increase
profit margins for flights across the Pacific.
   ``In the United States you've got six or seven carriers flying
into London six times a day but if you want to go to Tokyo you've
got maybe four carriers, each having one flight a day,'' said
analyst Stephen Dexter of Kemper Financial Services Inc.
   ``A lot of people want to go to Tokyo and they'll pay a premium
price to get there.''

<TEXT>
   Gulf nations hit hard economically by
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait are putting on brave faces
despite big cash crunches, paralyzed stock markets, drooping trade
and bolting expatriates.
   Gulf banks squeezed of their liquidity by the mass scramble for
dollars in August have been releasing statements saying the
situation has normalized.
   Abdullah Saif, governor of the Bahrain Monetary Agency, recently
told the Arabic-language daily Al-Ayam that ``the public has
already started to return some of those funds to the banking
system. Stability is quickly returning to Bahrain's banking
sector.''
   But neutral observers say the oil-rich region is in a state of
limbo.
   ``The sooner the state of no-war no-peace is over, the better,''
said a Western businessman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Normality has returned to some extent, but unless it's a
matter of quick profit, no one's going to risk anything for the
moment.''
   Deposits in Bahrain's commercial banks declined by 12 percent
during the panic that gripped the region in the first weeks after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion. Some 1.9 billion riyals, about $5 billion,
were pulled out of Qatar by the end of August.
   In the United Arab Emirates, Central Bank Governor Abdul-Malik
al-Hamar estimated that in the first two weeks of August, deposits
including those by the government dropped by 5.9 percent.
Private-sector deposits declined by 9.8 percent, he said.
   Bahrain, Qatar, the U.A.E., Oman, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are
grouped in the GCC economic and security alliance. Together with
Iraq and Iran, the Gulf states sit on two-thirds of the world's
proven oil reserves.
   GCC assistant secretary-general for economic affairs Abdullah
al-Quwaiz told the Saudi Press Agency in Riyadh this week that
``ministers of finance and economy and central bank governors in
the Gulf Cooperation Council are confident about the solidity of
the economic, fiscal and banking conditions of the member states,''
   Fawzi Behzad, director of Bahrain's Stock Exchange, also
dismissed his market's tumbling as a normal reaction to the
situation.
   ``Bahrain's stock market was strong enough to absorb what
happened in the Gulf,'' he said. ``Just like any market, prices go
up when there is good news, and they go down when the news is
bad.''
   But observers say some uncertainty remains.
   Exchange houses throughout the region have been among the
busiest centers as expatriate workers diligently remit their
salaries back home in greater volume than before.
   The profile of Gulf foreign trade has changed considerably. A
businessman in the U.A.E., who asked to not be named, said local
banks were asking for 100 percent cash coverage for letters of
credit, which is not possible for most medium-sized companies.
   Nervous shippers are also asking for cash down payments before
sailing. Five major lines serving the Gulf announced rate hikes due
to additional fuel charges and currency adjustment rates.
   Property values have decreased across the Gulf, and the
departure of an estimated 10 percent of expatriates has affected
trading, said Abdul-Nebi al-Sho'ala, a member of Bahrain's Chamber
of Commerce. ``The purchasing of luxury items and durables has
decreased,'' he said.
   Recruitment agencies also say there will be fewer Westerners
working in the region.
   ``Now it is really difficult to get new recruits from Europe to
convince them to work in the Gulf, and those who accept would like
to impose their own conditions, including astronomical salaries,''
said Christine Bond, managing director of the ABC Agency in Abu
Dhabi.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Reinvents a Community Newspaper</HEAD>

   Knight-Ridder Inc. unveils a redesigned
newspaper Thursday that seeks a share of quality time in this
baby-boomer rich suburb.
   The News, a reconstituted 35-year-old daily, takes its visual
cues from USA Today with heavy use of color, maps and indexes,
eye-catching graphics and clean lines.
   In content, short, trendy stories will be the norm. Broadsheet
sections have been reserved for the top news, local developments,
business and sports. Feature articles are offered in a tabloid
magazine called Essentials.
   ``What we did was to take a very specific community and say, `If
we were reinventing the newspaper, if a newspaper didn't exist in
this place, and we were trying to create a newspaper that we
thought would have the greatest appeal to the people in this
community, what would it be?' '' said James Batten, Knight-Ridder
chairman and chief executive officer.
   While many newspapers have evolved along similar lines in recent
years, this is one of the most thoroughly researched projects aimed
at baby boomers. The population bulge between ages 25 and 43 also
has among it many infrequent newspaper readers.
   ``People were skeptical at first because they were afraid we
were trying to reinvent USA Today for the local area,'' said Lou
Heldman, the project's corporate coordinator.
   ``It is meant to have all of the traditional journalistic
components: to do investigative reporting, to be a watchdog over
government and institutions, to run stories with an edge when
that's called for and to not homogenize the writing style.''
   Nearly two years of research went into a prototype intended as a
model for the company, which produces 29 dailies, including The
Miami Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Detroit Free Press.
   ``There are 77 million people in the baby boom generation. They
will be the primary customers for news for about the next 40
years,'' Heldman said. ``No one can afford to forget them if they
want to be in business 20 years from now.''
   But for decades, many newspapers stayed the same staid gray
shade while everything from television to working women were
remaking American society.
   ``We don't spend much time in the business asking ourselves what
our readers are interested in,'' News editor Wayne Ezell conceded.
``We tend to engage people who read newspapers. We need to talk to
the people who don't read newspapers.''
   Miami-based Knight-Ridder has done that and thinks it has
produced a product busy boomers will want.
   ``This one has the cosmetic element to it, but the cosmetics are
not what is important here,'' Ezell said. ``We are trying to write
more about things that people are talking about.''
   The newspaper, whose circulation is estimated at 40,000, has
been tailored specifically for Boca Raton, a community of 67,000
people between Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Its image is
that of an upscale retirement haven, but 30 percent of the
population is in the baby boomer pool, half of whom have arrived in
the past five years.
   Loyal, older readers haven't been left out. A focus group study
of readers over age 45 showed that ``it's a bigger hit frankly with
the older readers than the younger readers,'' he said.
   Batten regards The News as a laboratory testing potential
applications for other Knight-Ridder papers.
   The changes are welcomed by industry analysts watching a company
whose strength has been its prize-winning editorial content.
   ``I think in today's busy world, people will appreciate this and
find the papers more readable,'' said investment analyst Susan
Putnam of Moran Asset Management in Greenwich, Conn. ``It'll be
interesting to see how it develops.''

   The nation's shaky real estate market has
become a nightmare for Travelers Corp., driving away investors and
sending the insurance giant's stock into a downward spiral.
   The slide accelerated last Friday when Travelers announced it
was cutting its dividend, putting aside $650 million in reserves
against future real estate losses, would report a third-quarter
loss of about $500 million, and would post a yearly loss for the
first time in its history.
   The company's stock, which sold for $49 per share in January
1987 and $25 per share in early September, tumbled from $20.75
Friday to $13.625 by the end of trading Wednesday.
   Analysts say Travelers' woes have deepened investors' fears
about insurance companies. Many, like banks and other financial
institutions, have extensive investments in real estate and
mortgages.
   A Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. index tracking stock prices of
multi-service insurance companies has dropped 28 percent since the
beginning of the year. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. stock closed
Wednesday at $29.875, off 50 cents from Tuesday, and down from a
1990 high of $57 per share.
   Analysts caution, however, that Travelers' problems don't
necessarily foreshadow serious troubles for other insurance giants.
They say Travelers has been an aggressive investor in real estate
and is saddled with a relatively high level of bad loans.
   ``In general, insurance companies do have exposure to real
estate problems, and some of those problems have yet to be
recognized,'' said Gloria Vogel, an analyst for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   ``The question becomes, `How far ahead of the pack is Travelers
in recognizing problems? Or is Travelers just in a worse
situation?''
   ``By the company's own acknowledgement, they made some errors,''
said Herbert Goodfriend, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. ``They were very aggressive in the early 1980s, with an
overindulgence in the Southwest.''
   Of its $57.3 billion in total assets, $17.3 billion is invested
in real estate, mostly in mortgage loans on commercial properties
such as hotels, office buildings and shopping centers.
   Travelers estimated Friday that $3.5 billion of its mortgage
loans are problems - either foreclosed, in the process of
foreclosure, or restructured to be repaid over a longer period.
   That news was not completely unexpected - the company was forced
to set aside $415 million in reserves in 1988.
   But the company also announced it was reducing dividends to
stockholders for the first time, from 60 cents to 40 cents for the
third quarter. It was that announcement, Goodfriend said, that
scared off investors and raised questions about Travelers' future.
   ``It destroyed investor confidence,'' he said. ``And it raises
the question of whether the company will stick to the new dividend
schedule.''
   Without the $650 million real estate charge, Travelers Chairman
Edward H. Budd pointed out, the company's operating income for 1990
was expected to exceed 1989 earnings of $319 million by as much as
25 percent.
   In an attempt to calm investors, Travelers executives met with
analysts and investors Monday in New York, spelling out a plan to
boost the company's capital by selling some assets.
   By cutting the dividend, the executives explained, they hoped to
save about $100 million and use it to expand the company's
money-making lines of property-casualty insurance and managed
health-care group insurance.
   But both of those lines face uncertain futures.
Property-casualty insurance tends to be a cyclical market, and most
analysts agree the cycle is slumping. And many analysts, including
Goodfriend, believe the growth of managed health-care group
insurance peaked in the 1980s and that Travelers may be arriving in
that market too late.

<HEAD>Saks Laying Off 700, Looking to Expand Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saks Fifth Avenue will lay off nearly 6 percent
of its workforce and plans to boost investment to renovate stores,
open specialty shops and expand its mail-order business.
   Some of the 700 job cuts are to be made immediately and the rest
are expected by the middle of next year, Saks Chairman Melvin
Jacobs said Wednesday. Most of the layoffs will be from Saks'
corporate staff.
   Saks, which has 47 stores in 22 states, has an overall workforce
of about 12,000.
   Jacobs said that while the retailer is looking for ways to cut
costs, it also plans a ``significant capital investment'' for store
renovations and improvements.
   Saks also aims at doubling its $55 million mail order business
over the next five years, and is considering opening specialty
stores and expanding overseas, said Philip Miller, a Saks vice
chairman.
   There was no indication that Saks, which has been one of the
most profitable U.S. retailers, was running in the red. As a
private company, it is not required to disclose its sales or profit
figures, but James Martinez, a Saks vice chairman, said sales were
running ``nicely ahead of last year.''
   Saks was bought last April by Investcorp, a Middle East-based
company that also has large stakes in other upscale retailers,
including Tiffany &amp; Co. and Gucci.
   When BAT Industries PLC put it on the market a year ago, Saks
was sought by a number of investor groups. Investcorp won the
bidding with a $1.5 billion offer.
   Jacobs said top Saks management holds an 8 percent stake in the
company. He described the retailer as now taking an entrepreneurial
approach, with executives being given the opportunity to also
acquire equity in the firm.

   In a country where tea is not just a beverage but
a social event, two companies are betting consumers will drop the
messy ritual of brewing leaves or bags and go for granules.
   But are Britons ready to have their favorite drink - or
``cuppa'' - any other way?
   Nestle failed to woo tea drinkers with an instant version more
than a decade ago, and many Britons are still horrified by office
instant tea made by machines.
   A spot check on a London street found Britons unenthusiastic
about the idea of tea granules, which Brooke Bond and Premier
Beverage Products said Wednesday they will begin distributing
nationwide.
   ``That would be dreadful,'' said Garnham Trotter, a 48-year-old
electrical engineer. ``We have instant tea in machines in the
office and it's really dreadful.''
   Susan Essex, a 26-year-old secretary, said: ``I think part of
the pleasure of tea is the brewing of it.''
   In the United States, instant iced tea is popular but the hot
version never caught on.
   Tea is the favorite drink in Britain; 80 percent of the
population over age 10 drinks tea every day and the average person
drinks three to four cups a day, the Tea Council says.
   Successful test runs in the Midlands in central England over the
past few months have convinced the two companies that their instant
tea is the biggest development in the $1.2 billion tea market since
tea bags hit Britain 37 years ago. Tea bags make four-fifths of all
cups brewed, loose tea the rest.
   The Tea Council's executive director, Illtyd Lewis, said there's
bound to be a market for instant tea.
   Still, he said, ``I don't see it turning the tea world on its
head. People will continue to brew the product in the traditional
ways as they have done for hundreds of years.''
   The two companies are spending $18 million marketing the
granules, and Premier Beverage Products even plans to distribute
free samples to half of Britain's homes.
   ``It's a natural progression,'' said Premier spokesman Tony
Camp. ``This is what coffee has done.''
   Camp conceded that making a traditional cup of tea is not so
difficult, or time-consuming - wet leftover bags aside. But ``if
you can put convenience and taste together, it seems to be a
winner,'' he said.
   Nestle sold Nestea as an instant hot tea in Britain in the 1960s
and 1970s, but it was not a success, said Nestle spokesman Allan
Allbeury.
   ``It was probably before its time,'' Allbeury said. ``People
would brew their tea very much to their particular tastes. Nestea
was a very standardized flavor.''

<TEXT>
   Share prices in Tokyo plunged today as Wall
Street's steep decline discouraged investors. The dollar closed
unchanged against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei 225-share index lost 909.48 points, or 3.87 percent,
closing at 22,585.63. That added to a 135-point drop on Tuesday.
Markets were closed Wednesday for a national holiday.
   Investors were discouraged by the 111-point decline in the Dow
Jones industrial average over the past two sessions. ``With
investors almost shocked by the New York market's declines, there
were very few buy orders,'' said Masashi Wakabayashi, a trader with
Yamaichi Securities Co.
   Traders also linked the decline to rising oil prices and the
weakening Tokyo bond market.
   In currency dealings, the dollar traded as low as 129.45 yen
before closing at 129.95 yen, matching its closing level on
Tuesday.
   The dollar opened lower after an overnight drop in New York, but
heavy profit-taking on the yen checked the dollar's slide, traders
said. Fears of possible interest rate cuts in Japan also supported
the dollar.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference
today that the dollar is falling too quickly against the yen,
despite basic factors in the market that support its decline.
   The market is still striving to adjust to prospects of lower
interest rates and weakening business conditions in the United
States, he said. Mieno added that the U.S. Federal Reserve is
likely to ease monetary policy soon, leading to lower interest
rates.
   Expectations of lower U.S. interest rates are encouraging
foreign exchange traders to sell the dollar as the value of
dollar-denominated securities declines.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
government bonds fell to 82.74 points from Tuesday's 83.48-point
close. Their yield climbed to 8.210 percent from 8.035 percent.

<HEAD>Government Sees $6.1 Billion Drop in Bank Insurance Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration predicts that bank
failures will reduce the government insurance fund protecting
deposits by $6.1 billion over three years, a House subcommittee
chairman says.
   The commercial bank fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
will decline from $11.4 billion at the end of June to $5.3 billion
by Sept. 30, 1993, which would mark its sixth consecutive annual
loss, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., said Wednesday.
   The shrinkage to less than half the fund's current size will
come even if regulators continue to raise insurance premiums
charged to banks, said Annunzio, chairman of the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions.
   He cited projections by the administration's Office of
Management and Budget contained in the budget agreement reached by
White House negotiators and congressional leaders on Sept. 30.
   The new estimates are far more pessimistic than the budget
office's previous projections. In June, it had estimated the FDIC
would show a profit of $600 million over the three-year period.
   Roger Watson, FDIC director of research, said the figures as
described by Annunzio ``certainly are pessimistic.''
   ``They are possible, but not likely,' he said.
   They show the fund reserves falling to only 22 cents for every
$100 in deposits by the end of the 1993 fiscal year. That is less
than one-fifth the $1.25 minimum considered safe and less than half
the 60-cent level in the fund at the end of June.
   ``These OMB projections are doubly alarming when you realize
that they are based on economic assumptions that do not include a
recession,'' Annunzio said. ``The taxpayer is in serious jeopardy
of being asked to bail out the banks.''
   Annual losses in the fund, by fiscal year, are projected at $3.7
billion in 1991, $2.3 billion in 1992 and $100 million in 1993.
   The latest forecast is being made despite an assumption that
insurance premiums paid by banks will continue to rise. The fee
already is set to increase from 12 cents per $100 of deposits this
year to 19.5 cents next year. The budget office assumed it would go
to 23 cents in 1992 and 1993.
   The FDIC itself has not made projections for its fund beyond the
end of this calendar year. The bank fund lost $1.8 billion in the
first six months of this year and will lose an additional $1
billion by Dec. 31, the agency has said.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said last summer the fund was
``under stress'' but would be adequate to handle foreseeable bank
failures, which are expected to total around 200 in 1990 for the
fourth consecutive year.
   Nevertheless, Seidman is asking Congress to lift legal caps on
how high his agency may raise its insurance premiums. Legislation
to do that has passed the House and is scheduled for action by the
Senate Banking Committee on Friday.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress's auditing arm, and the
Congressional Budget Office have issued warnings about the
condition of the bank insurance fund.

   Advocates of toughened import restrictions
intended to protect the jobs of American textile, clothing and shoe
workers will have to wait for another day.
   For the third time in five years, supporters of tighter quotas
failed Wednesday night to muster a required two-thirds majority in
the House to override President Bush's veto of a quota bill.
   The 275-152 roll call fell only 10 votes short of the needed
margin of approval, however, and opponents predicted the issue will
be back when a new Congress convenes in January. ``Three strikes
and you're out may be the rule in baseball, but not necessarily on
Capitol Hill,'' said Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill.
   In vetoing the measure last Friday, Bush said the measure would
``pick the pockets of U.S. consumers'' at an average cost of $100 a
year in higher clothing prices for a typical family of four and
undermine efforts to get other countries to lower their barriers to
American exports.
   Over the past decade, the United States has lost some 400,000
textile and apparel jobs - 66,000 in the last year alone - to a
tripling of imports from low-wage trading partners.
   ``For all the rhetoric and theory about free trade, the real
issue is American jobs - of people we were elected to represent,
who pay taxes to keep this government going,'' Rep. Helen Bentley,
R-Md., said in urging an override.
   The Senate passed the bill in July by a potentially veto-proof
margin of 68-32. The House approved it last month, 271-149, despite
Bush's repeated vows to that he would veto it.
   Wednesday's vote maintained Bush's perfect veto record since
taking office 20 months ago. He has disapproved 15 bills, and all
10 override attempts in Congress have failed.
   The bill would have imposed new quotas on a product-by-product
and country-by-country basis to limit the annual growth of U.S.
imports in textiles and textile products to 1 percent a year.
   Imports of non-rubber footwear - leather, vinyl and plastic
shoes - would have been frozen at 1989 levels. None of the
provisions would have applied to Canada and Israel, which have
free-trade agreements with the United States.
   Congress passed nearly identical bills in 1985 and 1988 but,
then as now, was unable to muster the two-thirds majorities needed
in both the House and Senate to override vetoes by former President
Reagan.
   This year, supporters were able to pick off opposition from some
farm-state lawmakers who feared trading partners would retaliate by
limiting their imports of U.S. agriculture products.
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., sponsored a provision to permit
textile, clothing and shoe imports above the quotas from any
country that increases its purchases of U.S. farm exports.
   However, many U.S. apparel manufacturers who had supported the
bill in the past abandoned it this time after relocating their
factories to Mexico and the Caribbean to employ low-wage workers to
cut and sew clothing from American-made fabric.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose in light European trading
late this morning. Gold prices were down but off the lows reached
earlier in Asia and late Wednesday in New York.
   Traders were unwilling to push the dollar lower amid the ongoing
political and military tension in the Persian Gulf. At the same
time, however, dealers tempered their dollar purchases because of
the weak U.S. economy and widespread expectations that the Federal
Reserve will ease U.S. interest rates soon.
   One currency analyst in Frankfurt said the dollar appears to be
pausing at present after its declines over the past few days and is
likely to continue downward soon given the ongoing economic
problems in the United States.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.95, unchanged from Tuesday.
Japanese markets were closed on Wednesday for a holiday. In London
late this morning, it was quoted at a higher rate of 130.55 yen.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9676, cheaper for
buyers than $1.9755 late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5315 German marks, up from 1.5285;
1.2845 Swiss francs, up from 1.2785; 5.1260 French francs, up from
5.1160; 1.7245 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7225; 1,147.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,143.25, and 1.1507 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1495.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$389.60 per ounce at midmorning, down from $390.25 bid late
Wednesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $388.50, down from $390.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.56 to close at a bid $389.71.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.37 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $4.53.

<HEAD>Opening a Stock Exchange Easy: Hard Part Is Finding Buyers And

   Opening a stock exchange 70 years after Lenin
outlawed trading is the easy part. Getting Soviets to invest
savings long hidden under mattresses will be the bigger hurdle.
   Aspiring Soviet investors and their New York Stock Exchange
mentors agreed during a seminar this week that a limited stock
exchange could be revived in the Soviet Union as early as next
year.
   But a full-fledged market will require both large-scale
privatization of state enterprises and widespread public education,
they said.
   ``People in this country, perhaps they could be persuaded to buy
something intangible,'' said Dmitri Tulin of the state bank, known
as Gosbank. ``They prefer to buy something substantial.''
   Soviets have accumulated a vast horde of paper rubles over the
years because high state subsidies and barren store shelves left
them little to spend their money on.
   Soviet economists estimate the so-called ruble overhang at about
250 billion rubles ($440 billion at the official exchange rate),
although U.S. experts say it is twice that.
   A recent survey by the ``Nedelya'' weekly publication found only
half of the 6,000 people it questioned had a bank account, and only
13 percent of them kept more than 1,000 rubles in it.
   The Wall Street experts said that if the Soviet government wants
to soak up those excess rubles and create tradeable shares, it
should begin selling off its wealth of state enterprises.
   First on to the auction block should be profitable companies or
those with good profit potential such as the Aeroflot state
airline, the Intourist travel agency or parts of the oil industry,
the Americans said.
   However, Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov told a concluding news
conference on Wednesday that the government has no firm timetable
for setting up a stock exchange or for widescale privatization.
   Like many government officials attending the three-day seminar,
he tried to put the brakes on the participants' enthusiasm, urging
the 400 business people, bankers, researchers and academics to go
slow and start small.
   Pavlov recommended that any new Soviet stock exchange start
trading in bonds, rather than shares. John Chalsty, who becomes
NYSE chairman next year, said that was a logical first step until
private companies can be formed.
   ``It was my sense that a securities exchange can in fact be
established in relatively short order, that it can start trading
securities, mostly fixed income, but that it will be a much slower
process before you actually get stocks, shares of ownership, traded
on that exchange,'' Chalsty said.
   ``That will depend on the progress of privatization. You've got
to have something to trade before you can trade it and before you
can have something to trade you've got to have an entity that's
tradeable.''
   The Soviet Cabinet, or Council of Ministers, said in June that
certain state enterprises could become joint stock companies and
issue shares to individuals and institutions.
   More than 400 companies, mostly commercial banks, already have
seized the offer although in most cases the government has retained
a majority interest. Without brokers, a stock market or even

   A stock market flourished in St. Petersburg - now Leningrad -
for more than 200 years until it was closed by World War I. Stocks
were outlawed after the Bolshevik Revolution. A smaller Moscow

by the Chamber of Commerce, and there were more than 100
commodities exchanges in czarist Russia.
   Hungary has the only functioning stock exchange in Eastern
Europe, but trading has been light since it opened in Budapest in

a draft law on securities and hopes to open a stock exchange next

   If it can be stir-fried or microwaved, a food
item stands a better chance of getting attention from importers in
prosperous Asian countries, says an Agriculture Department report.
   Consumer tastes are changing in the Orient. Fast foods,
Western-style meals and a growing interest in healthful diets are
making an impact.
   ``Asian consumers are also returning to their culinary roots,
seeking out traditional foods, but with a new twist -
convenience,'' said Violet Oon, a food editor in Singapore. ``The
result is a desire for tradition in a packet that can be defrosted
or microwaved.''
   Oon, writing in the November issue of AgExporter magazine, said
the new trends of Asian eating didn't develop overnight.
   Basically, she said, the changes in consumer tastes are linked
to rising disposable income, openness to imports, a receptive news
media and growth of the middle class.
   Singapore is ``on the leading edge in consumer tastes'' among
the countries of Southeast Asia, Oon said.
   As countries develop economically, more and more consumers eat
out as women join the work force. And domestic help is hard to come
by.
   ``This has meant that home cooking is not what it once was,''
Oon said. ``Traditional cooking methods have been forgotten, and
cooking has gone instant.''
   For example: freshly squeezed coconut milk in bottles,
deep-fried shallots and pre-peeled and pre-cut onions for the
preparation of traditional meals, whether they are Malay,
Indonesian or Singaporean.
   ``Anything traditional that can be pre-packaged or pre-mixed has
a ready market,'' Oon said.
   There is still another trendy wave among Asians, she said. This
is an obsession with health and nutrition, particularly the use of
cooking fats and their relationship to cholesterol.
   ``Even China has not been immune to this trend,'' Oon said.
``Representatives of the international edible oils industry report
that the Chinese have switched from lard to vegetable oil.''
   Despite the emphasis on healthful eating habits, Oon said
restaurants report that low-calorie menus are generally shunned by
Asian customers. Yet, the health-food shops are doing well.
   ``What this means is that when it comes to eating out, the Asian
consumer still wants to eat sinfully,'' she said. ``It's only when
eating in the privacy of the home that the Asian consumer is really
concerned about health.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A recent big sale of cigarettes to the Soviet
Union was good news for U.S. tobacco farmers and served further
notice of a growing dependence on overseas markets, according to an
Agriculture Department report.
   Two companies are selling 34 billion cigarettes to the Soviets
over the next two years, the department's Economic Research Service
said in the October issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``The Soviet deal is equal to nearly 25 percent of U.S.
cigarette exports in 1989 and appears to be only a forerunner of
U.S. cigarette trade with Eastern European and newly industrialized
countries,'' the report said.
   Cigarette use in the United States declined 18 percent between
1981 and 1990, due mainly to health concerns, slipping social
acceptance and rising prices. Meanwhile, exports jumped from 83
billion cigarettes in 1981 to 142 billion last year.
   The export growth reflects lower trade barriers in Japan, Taiwan
and South Korea. Other contributing factors were said to be the
high quality of U.S. cigarettes, rising incomes in importing
countries and the decline of the dollar against foreign currencies.
   Easter European countries also are showing more interest in U.S.
cigarettes, the report said. And the Soviet sale is probably ``only
the beginning of an important trade with the former Communist bloc
countries,'' it said.
   The sales to the Soviet Union may take 3 percent to 5 percent of
U.S. cigarette production within two years, the report predicted.
   ``This, combined with potential sales to other East European
countries such as Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and formerly East
Germany, means that export sales stand to more than offset the
steadily declining domestic market,'' it said.
   The net result, it added, could be that U.S. cigarette and
tobacco leaf production may stabilize or increase, even with the
big declines in domestic cigarette consumption.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Farmers have reduced acreages of fresh market
vegetable for harvest this fall by about 3 percent from a year ago,
the Agriculture Department said.
   A report Wednesday showed reductions for carrots, sweet corn,
head lettuce and tomatoes. Only broccoli, cauliflower and celery
showed increases from a year ago.
   In all, farmers expect to have 157,900 acres for the fall
harvest, down from 163,500 a year ago, the report said.

   The government has approved a series of

debt over the next 18 months.
   The Treasury Department said Wednesday that it approved 29
private bidders for the swaps. The bids will lighten Mexico's

   The investment will go toward projects in agriculture, tourism,
communications, transportation and industry, the government said.
   The announcement marked the close of the second and final round

accords. The first round ended July 18.

   Amoco Oil Co. offered the highest bids and
bought the most oil in the first sale from the U.S. Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.
   Chicago-based Amoco offered $39.06 a barrel for 200,000 barrels
of the sweet crude oil and submitted the winning bids averaging
$38.60 on a total of 1.12 million barrels of sweet crude .
   President Bush on Sept. 26 ordered the sale of oil from the
reserves stored in underground salt domes in Louisiana and Texas,
saying he wanted to try hold down the oil prices that soared since
the start of the Middle East crisis.
   Except for a brief test, the oil had not been put to use since
the reserve was created in 1975.
   The department asked for bids on five million of the 590 million
barrels in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and received bids for
10.4 million barrels.
   The Energy Department said the remaining bids were too low
because they didn't meet the congressional mandate that all bids be
at least 90 percent of the market value of a barrel of crude.
   All of the sweet crude that was offered was sold.

<HEAD>Longshoremen Walk Out After California Union Officer Arrested</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arrest of a local union officer
instigated a walkout by hundreds of longshoremen, effectively
shutting down cargo handling at one of the nation's busiest ports
today.
   About 300 dockworkers stopped work at the Port of Los Angeles on
Wednesday night after investigators came seeking a man for alleged
non-payment of child support. A union official was arrested for
investigation of inciting a riot.
   Mike Puliselich, a union member and cargo dispatcher, said it
would be ``business as usual at the ports'' when day shift workers
reported to their jobs at 8 a.m. PDT. He declined to comment on the
walkout.
   The International Brotherhood of Longshoremen and Warehousemen
Local 13 said it would issue a statement later today.
   The wildcat strike affected 33 ships, including at least one
carrying U.S. military supplies to the Middle East, said Los
Angeles Port Police Sgt. Martin Renteria.
   The action has had little immediate impact on ship traffic or
other port operations because few ships are loaded or unloaded at
night.
   ``It's not like being on the interstate with an accident backing
everything up,'' Coast Guard Lt. Bob Shields said.
   On Wednesday, investigators from the district attorney's office
went to the union hall in Wilmington to serve an arrest warrant on
Roy Neal for allegedly failing to pay child support, district
attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said.
   The investigators, Jeff Oh and Ron Hobson, were admitted to the
union hall and sat on a back bench.
   The union sergeant-at-arms, John Louis Nappi, then announced
that non-union members must leave the hall and added, according to
Ms. Gibbons, ``You two cops sitting on the back bench, get out
now.''
   The crowd in the hall advanced on the investigators, she said.
Oh drew his gun, and the investigators ducked into a nearby office
and locked the door, she said.
   The investigators called for help.
   Twenty Los Angeles police officers arrived and quelled the
crowd. Nappi was arrested for investigation of inciting a riot, Ms.
Gibbons said. He was released on $500 bail.
   The man sought by the investigators was not arrested.

<HEAD>Chemical Giant Cuts Brazil Workforce by 3,500</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French chemical and pharmaceutical giant
Rhone-Poulenc SA said Thursday it will slash 3,500 jobs from its
Brazilian workforce due to government austerity measures that are
crimping business activity there.
   Voluntary layoffs are being conducted at the Sao Paolo-based
Rhodia SA, which makes chemicals, fibers and medical products, a
company spokeswoman said.
   ``People that leave simply won't be replaced,'' she said.
   About 2,000 workers have already left since Brazilian President
Fernando Collor de Mello instituted his anti-inflation austerity
program last year. Another 1,500 are expected to go over the next
two years, the spokeswoman said.
   Rhone-Poulenc's first-half profits were off 13 percent from a
year ago, partly due to a $58.7 million loss at Rhodia.
   It was the first loss recorded by the Brazilian division, which
had been a jewel in Rhone-Poulenc's crown during the 1980s. Rhodia
once accounted for 10 percent of revenue and an impressive 25
percent of profits.
   Other French firms have suffered in Brazil due to the stiff
measures, including eyeglass specialist Essilor International SA
and auto parts producer Valeo SA.
   The Rhone-Poulenc spokeswoman noted that the situation in Brazil
has improved since midsummer but said it would be three years
before the company regained lost ground.
   The job cuts at Rhodia - from 14,000 to 10,500 - will free up
funds that cash-strapped Rhone-Poulenc can use to offset its $2
billion acquisition cost of U.S.-based Rorer Group Inc.
   An economic slowdown in the United States has cast doubt on the
profit-making potential of the new unit, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer SA.
   As part of its cash-raising strategy, the company recently sold
its Paris headquarters to a group of French banks, while its
Spanish polyvinyl chloride business went to a unit of Societe
Nationale Elf Aquitaine.

   The stock market edged upward today in a bid to
rally from its lowest levels of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .25 to 2,408.17 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers took a narrow lead over losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 468 up, 428 down and
477 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.03 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said there was little in the news to relieve the gloom
that has gripped the market since midsummer.
   The price of crude-oil for November delivery climbed about $1 a
barrel, to just under $40 a barrel, in early trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Recession worries have kept mounting of late as investors await
the peak flow of corporate earnings reports for the third quarter,
due over the next couple of weeks.
   But economic weakness hasn't so far brought any downward
pressure on long-term interest rates.
   Brokers also said market participants were frustrated by the
slow progress and many twists and turns of efforts in Washington
toward a plan to narrow the federal budget deficit.
   The Limited dropped &rsqb; to 12&lsqb; in active trading. The company said
its margins were somewhat lower in the third quarter than they had
been in the corresponding period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.08 to 164.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .81 at 298.45.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.62 to

<HEAD>Jury Awards $1 Million in Stray Voltage Damages to Dairy Farmers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GAYLORD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has awarded $1 million to dairy
farmers who claimed a stray electrical current substantially cut
their cows' milk production.
   The damages were awarded late Tuesday to Dale and Gloria
ZumBerge and their son, Steven, following a 2{-week trial in Sibley
County District Court.
   The three had sued Northern States Power Co., claiming the
utility failed to warn them about stray voltage - errant
electricity that enters the ground from grounded electrical
distribution systems. The three also said NSP failed to bring it
under control once it was discovered.
   ``It took a tremendous load off our shoulders,'' Dale ZumBerge,
51, said of the verdict. He said he pressed the case partly out of
pride, to prove that his cows' problems were not the result of poor
management.
   Sam Macalus, NSP spokesman, said the company was ``extremely
disappointed'' with the verdict and may appeal. He said NSP's
position ``is that the evidence in the case doesn't demonstrate the
reduction in dairy production was due to stray voltage.''
   The problem of stray voltage was recognized by researchers in
several nations as early as the 1940s. They cited health dangers
from current that flowed through the ground, into barns and into
the bodies of cows and dairy farmers.
   The ZumBerges' lawyer, Jim Kaster, said the family began
automating its Green Isle farm in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
In 1984, after three years of declining milk production, the
ZumBerges read about stray voltage in a dairy magazine. They called
their milking company, which did some tests. NSP was called, and
the utility found 1.9 volts of electricity outside the barn. Other
tests found 3 volts inside the barn.
   Kaster and experts testifying in behalf of the Zumberges
contended that the resulting irritation to the cows affected their
ability to give milk.
   In 1984, NSP put up a blocking device at the primary pole where
electrical service arrives at the farm, and that successfully
halted the problem. But Kaster contended that when NSP put in a new
transformer on that pole a few months later, the blocking device
was reinstalled incorrectly. That problem was corrected last
February, with a dramatic increase in production the next month,
according to ZumBerge.
   The ZumBerge will use the money to pay off creditors who
accumulated as the milk production dropped, Kaster said.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca said he
neither bemoaned money troubles nor tried to bargain with United
Auto Workers leaders this morning as talks reopened between the
union and automaker.
   ``We had a nice hour's discussion. I gave them a
state-of-the-union, state-of-the company message,'' Iacocca said.
``I didn't plead poverty. I didn't bargain. That's not my role.''
   Iacocca said he told about 40 UAW leaders at the meeting in
Highland Park that some parts of the agreement reached with General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. won't work for Chrysler, and he
said the sides agreed to discuss them. He refused to be specific.
   Chrysler and the UAW had suspended talks begun in mid-July while
the UAW negotiated a contract with GM. That pact was used as a
pattern for an agreement reached with Ford. Chrysler and the UAW
resumed talks today.
   UAW spokesman Bob Barbee said Iacocca got a positive reception.
``You didn't see him come down here with a bloody nose or anything,
did you?'' Barbee said.
   Meanwhile, GM reached agreement late Wednesday on a contract
covering 22,500 members of the International Union of Electronic
Workers, pledging $250 million to guarantee job security.
   Also, the union for 36,500 Canadian GM workers called off a
strike 20 minutes before a midnight Wednesday deadline, citing
progress in contract talks in Toronto.
   In Detroit, GM and union negotiators reached the tentative,
three-year national contract at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, hours ahead of
a midnight strike deadline.
   The union had been working under a contract that expired last
month, but told GM on Sunday that it would cancel the pact and
strike Wednesday at midnight.
   ``This is one of the best contracts we have ever negotiated,''
IUE negotiator Frank Sollitto said.
   Sollitto said the new pact guarantees job security for the IUE's
22,500 workers in Ohio, New York, New Jersey and Mississippi
through a $250 million fund.
   ``It provides greater job security than ever before, excellent
improvements in our pension plan, improved wages, full protection
against inflation, a $600 Christmas bonus every year of the
contract and a fairer profit sharing formula,'' Sollitto said.
   GM officials also praised the pact.
   ``For these past three months, bargainers from the company and
the IUE had to face a number of difficult and complex issues,''
said Alfred S. Warren Jr., GM vice president of industrial
relations.
   ``However, the dedication and efforts of both sides of the
bargaining table has resulted in an agreement that benefits both
the corporation and the GM employees that are represented by the
IUE,'' he said.
   While the IUE's contract with GM, which expired Sept. 14, was
similar to the automaker's pact with the United Auto Workers union,
the IUE and UAW bargain separately. Last month, GM reached a
contract agreement with the UAW.
   The GM-IUE agreement also includes:
   - Across the board wage increases of 3 percent, retroactive to
Sept. 17.
   - Special 30-cents-per-hour increases for skilled trades
workers, retroactive to Sept. 17.
   - Performance wage bonuses of 3 percent in the second and third
years of the contract.
   ``There were no concessions in this contract - none,'' Sollitto
said. ``And we won the best job security protection anywhere in the
industry.''
   Workers at IUE plants supply suspension systems, electrical
parts, motors, batteries, windshield wipers and air conditioner
compressors.
   The last IUE walkout against GM occurred in 1976 and lasted 10
hours.
   In Toronto, the Canadian Auto Workers union said it was close to
an agreement late Wednesday with GM and hoped to settle early
today.
   The basis for the talks has been a contract the union reached
with Ford Motor Co. of Canada last month after a nine-day strike.

<HEAD>For Those Willing To Pay, Home Delivery Booming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Water is supposed to be cool, clear, healthy,
refreshing and if not free, at least cheap.
   But more and more people are paying serious money to have
bottles of water delivered to thei homes, saying they wonder about
the safety of what flows out of the pipe or just don't like the
taste.
   Lisa Ehrlich, for example, says she pays $140 a month to have
bottles of spring water home delivered in suburban Bethesda, Md.,
where she lives with her husband and their two children. The
Ehrlichs go through a half-dozen five-gallon bottles every two
weeks.
   ``For our budget it's a lot to pay, but our water is important
to us,'' Mrs. Ehrlich said. ``It makes me nervous to drink city
water. Plus it tastes great.''
   Industry statistics show home delivery to be the fastest-growing
segment of a booming business, outpacing water sales in restaurants
and grocery stores as well as office deliveries.
   A total of 424.8 million gallons of water was delivered to
American homes in 1989, an increase of 70 percent from the 1985
figure of 248.7 million gallons.
   Jane Lazgin, spokeswoman for the Perrier Group of America Inc.
in Greenwich, Conn., said there are indications home delivery of
water is more than a passing fad.
   ``We find interest from kitchen designers, who are building
kitchens leaving space for the bottled water dispenser,'' she said.
``There's a certain novelty attached to it, but it's becoming more
of a refreshment beverage choice.''
   The Perrier Group, the biggest U.S. bottled water company, has
three major domestic water brands - Great Bear, Poland Spring and
Arrowhead - all available for home delivery. Its flagship Perrier
brand, like other carbonated waters, is not generally home
delivered.
   The average price for home-delivered water is $4.91 for a
five-gallon bottle, according to the International Bottled Water
Association, the industry's trade association based in Arlington,
Va.
   About 60 percent of bottled water buyers say they're interested
mainly in better taste, the association said. Other reasons cited
are safety and, more specifically, worries about chemicals in tap
water.
   ``The area where I live I'm not sure of the water supply,'' said
Robert Sims, who has a five-gallon bottle of water delivered to the
door of his one-bedroom apartment in Dallas every three weeks.
   Sims said he liked the taste of the bottled water, but was
motivated more by safety concerns.
   ``There'll be some brownish orangy color'' sometimes when he
turns on the water, Sims said in a telephone interview. ``I've been
told that it's absolutely safe, but I'd rather not be drinking
something that came out of those pipes.''
   Federal regulations on public water systems set strict purity
standards for dangerous chemicals and disease-causing germs. When
the rules were tightened last year, the Environmental Protection
Agency said the action could prevent up to 90,000 water-borne
diseases each year.
   Health issues, however, are dealt with carefully in bottled
water advertisements and promotions.
   ``IBWA members do not, according to law, make health claims
about bottled water,'' a statement from the association said.
``However, all bottled water must come from a government-approved
source. In addition, because bottled water is a `food' product, it
must meet more stringent andadditional regulations than tap
water.''
   Critics of the industry contend that regulations are not tight
enough to ensure that bottled water is free of contamination.
   The Environmental Policy Institute in Washington issued a report
last year concluding that there was a ``widespread misconception
that the separate packaging and higher cost of bottled water
guarantees a product substantially safer and healthier than
ordinary tap water.''
   The report, ``Bottled Water: Sparkling Hype at a Premium
Price,'' urged consumers to ask for information about their normal
water supply or have a sample tested before jumping to the
conclusion that bottled water would be better.
   Mrs. Ehrlich said she was aware that contaminants had been found
in some bottled waters. She said her family was considering
switching to a system that would distribute pure distilled water
throughout the house.
   ``Who knows for sure if what you're getting is so great,'' she
said. ``We're trying to do the best, but who knows? The best might
not be so good nowadays.''

   General Motors Corp. unveiled its new
Saturn line today, but don't look for showroom floors to be filled
with the import-fighting car in the next two weeks.
   There won't be as many new models on showroom floors as Saturn
officials would like. There will, however, be enough to sell,
Saturn Vice President Don Hudler said today.
   ``We're not going to be judged by the number of cars in the
showroom on day one,'' Hudler said. ``We want to be judged on
quality and customer satisfaction.''
   Gov. Ned McWherter drove the first Saturn destined for a dealer
showroom out of the $1.9 billion plant today. With him were Saturn
President Richard G. ``Skip'' LeFauve, United Auto Workers official
Dick Hoalcraft and UAW regional executive Bobby Lee Thompson.
   With the Saturn project, GM has promised an American model that
looks and drives like an import.
   GM has committed $3 billion to the Saturn project - the
automaker's first new division in 58 years - as it tries to regain
some of the market share lost to imports.
   Officials at Saturn Corp., created by GM as a subsidiary to show
its distinction from the rest of the company, wants 80 percent of
the car's buyers to come from import shoppers, LeFauve said.
   Scott Merlis, an auto analyst with Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York, called the target a pipe dream.
   ``There will be cannibalization'' as Saturn takes sales from
other GM divisions, Merlis said. GM now offers the Geo Prizm and
the Chevrolet Cavalier in the same price range as Saturn.
   The car's introduction will get plenty of free publicitiy. News
media from around the world planned to cover the event. CBS planned
a live spot from the plant 40 miles south of Nashville during
today's ``This Morning'' show. NBC is scheduled to air a live
segment from the Saturn plant during Friday morning's ``Today''
show.
   Early reviews of the high-tech Saturn praised its price ($7,995
for the base model) and fuel economy (27-37 mpg). But they rapped
the car's engine rumble.
   Saturn officials will not discuss reports that the $1.9 billion
plant is behind its production schedule.
   The plant, designed to produce 250,000 cars a year, is on a
``planned acceleration curve,'' and there will be plenty of cars
for sale beginning Oct. 25, Ms. Schettler said.
   GM has lined up 116 Saturn dealers around the country, but only
about 30 dealers in the South, West and Southwest will start
selling the cars in free-standing dealerships later this month.
   It will take at least six months before Saturn cars are
available in most major U.S. markets.
   Fifty dealers - Saturn calls them retailers - arrived in Spring
Hill last week to undergo the company's sales training course,
LeFauve said.
   ``Those folks are so enthusiastic about what we're doing.
They're absolutely turned on about our product and say that we
can't make enough of them,'' LeFauve said.

   manufacturer, American Motors Corp., withheld documents from the
government in a deliberate cover-up, Curry said. Chrysler Corp.
acquired AMC in 1987.
   The safety probe was requested by Public Citizen, the Center for
Auto Safety and the Institute for Injury Reduction. Such
investigations can lead to recalls.
   They asked the agency to investigate what their petition
described as ``the undue, unnecessary and defective propensity of
the CJ vehicles to roll over.''
   The groups accused AMC of knowing the vehicles' suspension
system was defective and their roll bar assembly inadequate.
   Curry said an exhaustive inquiry showed the Jeep CJ's likelihood
to roll over was ``slightly higher'' than the average for all
utility vehicles. But the CJ ``does not stand out from its peers to
an extent that warrants further investigation,'' he said.
   Deaths in CJ rollover accidents totaled 116 in 1989, said
Michael Brownlee, the agency's associate administrator for
enforcement.
   AMC sold 609,356 CJ-5 and CJ-7 vehicles between 1972 and 1986,
when production was stopped. An estimated 420,000 are still
registered for highway use.
   The utility vehicle in general is less stable and more likely to
roll over than a passenger car, Curry said. It is narrow and has a
short wheel base and high axles and suspension system.
   For that reason, the government requires manufacturers to attach
a sticker to utility vehicles warning drivers to use extra caution.
   But Curry said people should be allowed to drive the vehicles if
they wish.

<HEAD>Reports: Trump Book Sales Flagging, Forced To Restructure More
Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump may be struggling to survive at the
top, but his second book seems to have lost the fight.
   The New York Times reported Thursday that the book, ``Surviving
at the Top,'' has tumbled off its best-seller list after only seven
weeks. The book, which expounds upon his self-proclaimed triumphs
and was published by Random House, is a sequel to ``The Art of the
Deal,'' which remained on the best-seller list for 48 weeks after
its publication in 1987.
   According to the Times, some booksellers believe far too many
copies of the sequel were printed. A Random House spokesman said
the publisher printed 500,000 copies and sales have been very good.
Still, sales remain beneath ``The Art of the Deal,'' of which
nearly one million copies were sold.
   Perhaps the public has had its fill of the musings of the
44-year-old entrepreneur, who has come to symbolize the image of
the brash 1980s by surrounding himself with luxury and building an
empire of real estate, casinos and an airline on borrowed money.
All three of his businesses have slumped sharply because of a
slowing economy.
   Trump's financial problems have been the object of repeated
speculation in recent months, including recurrent rumors that he
will be forced to seek bankruptcy protection. But Trump's aides and
some of his creditors have said they believe negotiations to
stretch out his debt payments will succeed.
   Still more bad news surfaced Thursday, when the Wall Street
Journal reported Trump will have to restructure more loans for his
Atlantic City gambling empire. The negative account comes just days
after Forbes magazine bumped Trump off its exclusive 400 Richest
Americans list, estimating his net worth to possibly be within
``hailing distance of zero.''
   The Journal said Trump has been forced to restructure $100
million in bank loans to the Trump Castle and Trump Taj Mahal
casinos because they aren't generating enough cash to repay that
debt.
   Trump already is in negotations with bondholder groups to
restructure $675 million in Taj Mahal debt. Two months ago he
negotiated a $65 million bank bailout that was supposed to give him
breathing room to repay his loans, which together are believed to
total more than $3 billion.
   The Journal quoted unidentified people close to Trump's lenders
as saying representatives of National Westminster Bank USA and
Midlantic National Bank have been meeting with Trump aides to
restructure loans for the two Atlantic City casinos and technically
could foreclose on them if the debts aren't paid. Each bank is owed
approximately $50 million.
   Bank officials declined to comment. Trump's chief financial
officer, Stephen Bollenbach, confirmed that talks are under way but
disagreed with the characterization that the negotiations are a
sign the developer's operations have deteriorated further.
   ``The way to look at this is we've got some very good business
in Atlantic City holding up very well in difficult times, and they
just aren't quite good enough to cover currently all their debt
service,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``I think everybody understands that,'' Bollenbach said. ``It's
a temporary problem. This is unlike other situations you read
about, where you have a basically flawed business.''
   Takevover investor Carl Icahn declined to comment Thursday on
the Journal's account that he was believed to have bought Trump's
casino bonds as a long-term investment. Bollenbach said he had
heard rumors of an Icahn purchase but it didn't concern him.
   ``I know Mr. Icahn is a sophisticated bond investor. I assume he
bought them at a discount,'' Bollenbach said. ``I suppose he sees
value in them.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting bearish
export signals in the wheat market and position-evening ahead of a
government crop report.
   Wheat futures fell sharply early in the afternoon amid rumors
that Jordan was seeking non-U.S. wheat after the Agriculture
Department rejected wheat bids from Jordan on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   Most corn and soybean futures also retreated, partly in sympathy
with wheat and partly in preparation for the USDA's revised corn
and soybean crop estimates, which were released after the close.
   In the report, the government projected the 1990 U.S. corn
harvest at 8.02 billion bushels compared with its September
estimate of 8.12 billion and market expectations averaging 8.06
billion.
   The USDA projected soybean production of 1.82 billion bushels
compared with the September estimate of 1.84 billion and market
expectations averaging 1.83 billion.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2{ cents to 5\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.71 a bushel; corn was
2} cents to 4 cents lower with December at $2.32} a bushel; oats
were 2 cents to 3\ cents lower with December at $1.19} a bushel;

<HEAD>A Dismal September For Retailers Amid Fears of Recession, War</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The news from the nation's biggest retailers Thursday was pretty
grim: Worries about recession and a possible war in the Persian
Gulf kept consumers on the sidelines in September, giving many
storeowners a dismal September.
   The retailers' monthly sales reports - some of which showed a
decline from September 1989 levels - did not augur well for a
robust Christmas shopping season.
   ``I don't see anything to suggest an improvement,'' said Jeffrey
Edelman, a retail industry analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., warned,
``It could get worse. ... We believe that for the first time in a
long time, we will have two very poor Christmases back to back.''
   Many retailers were forced to slash prices - and consequently,
their profit margins - to bring in sales last Christmas. Feiner
predicted earnings would decline again in the fourth quarter
although many companies are being very cautious and preparing for
the worst - another bleak holiday season.
   A slump in profits in the final quarter could be devastating for
retailers, who depend on this period for about 50 percent of their
full-year earnings.
   September's results came as no surprise. August sales, which
normally are boosted by back-to-school shopping, showed signs of a
spending slowdown.
   Consumers were already nervous about the economy and the
security of their own jobs when the Persian Gulf crisis and rising
oil prices exacerbated recession fears and gave them less money to
spend on so-called discretionary items such as clothes and
furniture.
   Edelman called the Middle East tensions ``the straw that broke
the camel's back.''
   The weather also affected sales, as temperatures ran above the
norm, and few consumers were in the mood to shop for winter
clothing.
   Feiner summed up the confluence of factors as ``a multi-faceted
barrage on the consumer.''
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., said sales
at stores open at least a year rose 4.4 percent for the five weeks
ended Oct. 6, while sales from all of its stores rose 4.2 percent.
   Analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year - also
known as same-store or comparable store sales - provide a truer
picture of a retailer's performance than overall sales do. Newer
stores tend to have extraordinarily robust sales that can skew a
retailer's results.
   K mart Corp. said its same-store sales inched up 0.7 percent
although overall sales rose 10.2 percent.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discount retailer that consistently
outperforms the rest of the industry, reported a same-store sales
gain of 9 percent and a 24 percent rise overall.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its same-store sales fell 3.4 percent,
while overall sales were off 2.3 percent.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. reported a 2 percent decline in same-store
sales, although overall sales were up 11.3 percent.
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
said its same-store sales dropped 3 percent, while overall sales
rose 10 percent.
   Thursday's reports also came as bad news for the economy, as
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the gross
national product. A drop-off in spending adversely affects other
economic sectors, including manufacturers who sell merchandise to
retailers.
   ``Retailers are playing a totally defensive ball game,''
reducing their orders to suppliers, said Feiner.
   The results announced Thursday differ from the monthly retail
sales report from the government. The Commerce Department includes
sales from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealerships in its
figures, which are scheduled to be released Friday morning.
   In other reports from retailers Thursday:
   - Woolworth Corp. reported a 2.1 percent gain in same-store
sales, and a 6.2 percent rise overall.
   - May Department Stores Co. said its same-store sales fell 1.8
percent, while overall sales picked up 3.5 percent.

<HEAD>Diaper Plant Closes But Town Optimistic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEBOYGAN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tissue paper factory that prospered on
the business of disposable diapers will close Friday, giving way to
other factories that can make the same product more cheaply.
   Procter &amp; Gamble's Paper Products Co. has been phasing down the
Cheboygan tissue paper plant since May 1989. At that time, the
company announced it would buy instead of make the absorbent paper
that goes into its Pampers diapers and Always adult panty liners.
The tissue was one of the main production lines at the Cheboygan
plant.
   Plant Manager Phil Baker said Thursday five other companies
expressed an interest in buying the plant and two still are
talking.
   ``It's not possible for us to be too optimistic yet. They've
visited the plant. They've looked at the equipment. But they are
trying to sort through what products they would make on this
equipment,'' Baker said.
   In 1989, Procter &amp; Gamble had 300 people working at the
Cheboygan factory. By Thursday, 130 of them had transferred to
other Procter &amp; Gamble operations around the country. Another 75 as
of Friday will be retired, Baker said.
   The closing of the 86-year-old plant robs Cheboygan of its
biggest employer.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Lobbies for National Health Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor leaders rallied Thursday in support of
establishing a national health insurance program to provide health
care for working people and others who cannot afford to pay for it.
   ``Unions are calling for national health insurance as the best
way to control health care costs, improve the quality of care and
make health care universally accessible,'' said Daniel Radford,
executive secretary-treasurer of the Cincinnati AFL-CIO Labor
Council.
   The Cincinnati rally was intended as part of a national AFL-CIO
campaign begun this month, which includes television
advertisements, to promote a national health insurance program.
   The AFL-CIO says 37 million Americans have no health care
coverage, and three-quarters of those are working people and their
families.
   The National Association of Working Americans, an affiliate of
the Cincinnati AFL-CIO Labor Council, said it also intended the
rally as a show of support for proposed Ohio legislation to create
``universal health care programs.''
   The proposal by state Rep. Robert Hagan, D-Youngstown, would
phase out private insurance and replace it with a comprehensive
plan for all citizens, with no co-payments or deductibles, said
Sally Krisel, director of the association.
   She said that as envisioned, the proposed plan would cover
everyone, reduce the required insurance paperwork and allow
participants their choice of doctors to perform the services. The
plan would be funded by taxes on payroll from employers and
employees, on interest and dividends, and on alcohol and tobacco
products.
   Hagan is redrafting his proposal and expects to formally
introduce it before the Ohio General Assembly in January, Ms.
Krisel said.

   The stock market took another beating today,

   Recession worries have kept mounting of late as investors await
the peak flow of corporate earnings reports for the third quarter,
due over the next couple of weeks.
   But economic weakness hasn't so far brought any downward
pressure on long-term interest rates.
   Brokers also said market participants were frustrated by the
slow progress and many twists and turns of efforts in Washington
toward a plan to narrow the federal budget deficit.

<HEAD>CPC International Earnings Up in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food giant CPC International said
Thursday its third-quarter net income rose by 13 percent, an
increase it attributed to growth in CPC's European and Latin
American corn refining operations.
   Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $98.6 million,
compared to $87.2 million in the 1989 period, the company reported.
Earnings per common share of $1.27 were up 12.4 percent from $1.13.
   Among the company's products are Hellman's mayonnaise and
Thomas' English muffins.
   ``Since 1986, our strategy has been to focus on our consumer
foods business for growth and to fuel that growth with strong cash
flow from corn refining operations,'' said CPC president C.R.
Shoemate. ``That strategy has resulted in three straight years of
significant earnings growth, and to that we will add another year
of good earnings improvement when final results for 1990 are
reported.''
   Con refining is a chemical process that separates corn into
various components used to make starches, sweeteners and corn oils,
said CPC spokesman William Parker.
   Worldwide sales in the quarter were also 13 percent higher than
a year ago, at $1.45 billion from $1.29 billion in 1989. Operating
income increased 16 percent, from $173.8 million to $201.3 million.
   Net income for the first nine months of 1990 amounted to $272.5
million, or $3.51 per share, compared to $238 million, or $3.05 per
share in 1989, according to company reports.
   Sales for the first nine months came to $4.26 billion, up 12
percent from $3.8 billion in the 1989 period.
   CPC, based in Englewood Cliffs, has operations in 47 countries
and 32,500 employees. About 80 percent of its 1989 sales, totalling
about $5.1 billion, came from consumer foods accounts in North
America, Europe, Latin America and Asia.

<HEAD>Ratings Short of Expectations, Fox Forced to Give Sponsors Free Ad
Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fox Broadcasting Co. has been forced to give
free advertising to dissatisfied sponsors because ratings have
fallen short of expectations, industry executives report.
   The network stopped selling advertising time for the fourth
quarter in order to use what was left for ``make-goods,'' the bonus
spots given away when shows fail to attract enough viewers, the Los
Angeles Times reported Thursday.
   ``The numbers have fallen so dramatically that they are using
most if not all of the available inventory for make-goods,'' the
Times quoted Richard Kostyra of the J. Walter Thompson ad agency in
New York as saying.
   The network's performance was ``considerably below what people
had estimated,'' he said.
   Fox attracted 5.7 percent of the national TV audience in the
first three weeks of the new fall season, well below the average 7
percent industry executives said it promised to advertisers.
   ``It will be extremely difficult for Fox to hold their
guarantees,'' said Steve Grubbs of BBDO Worldwide, another New York
ad agency.
   Fox said it would make good on guarantees, noting the network
had not yet run new episodes for all of its shows.
   ``We are capable of making good on our guarantees,'' said Fox
president Jamie Kellner. ``Historically, Fox takes a dip in
September and October while the networks are promoting their new
shows, but we build after that.
   ``We're comfortable where we are right now.''
   Fox, the newspaper said, was counting heavily on Thursday
night's premiere of ``The Simpsons,'' hoping high ratings would
have a ``halo effect'' on the shows that follow it.
   The network promised ``The Simpsons'' sponsors, who paid up to
$400,000 for a half-minute commercial, that new episodes will
attract at least 27 percent of the TV audience, advertising
executives said.
   Reruns of ``The Simpsons'' in its new Thursday night time slot
against new episodes of NBC-TV's ``The Cosby Show'' haven't fared
well. Since August ``The Simpsons'' has averaged only 15 percent
compared to 35 percent for ``Cosby.''

<HEAD>Drop in Gambling Revenues, Sluggish Economy Contribute to Hilton
Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. said Thursday a
sluggish economy and a drop in casino gambling revenues caused its
third-quarter profit to drop 49 percent.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, net income before property
transactions amounted to $15.4 million, or 32 cents per share.
   Including property transactions, net income for the quarter
ending Sept. 30 totaled $21.9 million, or 45 cents per share,
compared to $28.1 million, or 58 cents per share, for the same
period last year.
   The company had $260 million in revenues, compared to $248.5
million a year ago.
   Competition has kept gamblers away from the Las Vegas Hilton.
The recently opened Excalibur and Mirage hotels have lured foot
traffic away from other Las Vegas hotels.
   ``The gaming division experienced a difficult quarter,'' said
Barron Hilton, chairman and president of Hilton.
   ``The hotel industry continues to contend with a sluggish
economy and excess capacity in many major markets. Results from out
hotels mirrored these conditions,'' he said.
   For the nine months ending Sept. 30, including property
transactions, net income was $85.2 million, or $1.76 per share,
compared to $83.2 million, or $1.72 per share, last year.
   Revenues came to $799.2 million, compared to $738.6 million last
year.

   Assets of the nation's 519 money market mutual
funds rose $1.48 billion in the latest week to a record $411.35
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the
record set a week earlier, when fund assets increased to $409.87
billion. The earlier record originally was reported as $409.96
billion but the Washington-based mutual fund trade group revised
it.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 255
general purpose funds rose $353.8 million to $146.15 billion,
assets of 105 broker-dealer funds increased $163.6 million to
$165.35 billion, and assets of 159 institutional funds rose $967.4
million to $99.85 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday was 7.48 percent, unchanged from the previous
week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in
Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield remained unchanged at 7.47 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, down from 47 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.02 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.05 percent a week earlier. The North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on
special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, fell to 5.00
percent from 5.02 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.68
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 7.81 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.82 percent; 7.91 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.92 percent;
and 8.06 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged from a week earlier.

<HEAD>Israeli Oil Tycoon Bids For Hunt's Ranch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTLAKE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli oil tycoon has made the latest
offer for the Circle T Ranch, the one-time haven of fallen Texas
oil baron Nelson Bunker Hunt.
   Gad Zeevi has offered between $33.5 and $35 million for the
2,000-acre ranch, considered by real estate experts to be the last
big chunk of prime undeveloped property in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported Thursday.
   Zeevi, who has homes and real estate holdings across the globe,
has no plans to develop the property, unnamed sources told the
newspaper.
   The ranch is controlled by the NBH Liquidating Trust, an estate
set up to sell all of Hunt's assets in one of the largest personal
bankruptcies in history. Most of the proceeds from the liquidation
will go to pay off Hunt's $1.5 billion debt with the Internal
Revenue Service.
   Trustee Carter Pate said in a statement three weeks ago that an
agreement had been entered into with SC Investment, Inc. a Houston
firm. Lawyer Jack Lapin, listed in state records as the
corporation's agent, declined to confirm or deny that Zeevi is
behind the investment firm.
   ``I'm not allowed to release any information,'' Lapin said.
   Pate did not immediately return telephone calls Thursday from
The Associated Press.
   Zeevi is an international developer and aeronautical engineer
with business interests in Kenya and Puerto Rico, according to
published reports. He is also a major partner in Israel's largest
oil company and owns a commodities trading company in London.
   Zeevi has indicated to several people involved in the
negotiations that he may use the ranch as Hunt did - as a weekend
retreat near the financial center of Texas' oil business.

   The Miller Brewing Co. is expected to
announce Friday whether it will open a 7-year-old brewery that had
received tax abatement and state assistance.
   Politician, irked that Miller has never delivered the promised
jobs, have threatened to revoke the tax benefits.
   Miller spokeswoman Helen Dennison declined Thursday to reveal
plans for the $411 million brewery, located near Trenton in Butler
County.
   Miller completed the brewery in 1983 and produced beer in a 1984
test run, but the plant been idle since then.
   One critic, state Rep. Michael Fox, R-Hamilton, said Miller has
received $11.5 million in tax reductions so far and stands to
receive $10.1 million in future tax breaks, under a 1979 agreement
to provide 1,500 jobs and a $30 million payroll by 1982 at the
1,070-acre site.
   Dennison said the brewery could begin producing beer within six
months of an announcement to open the facility.
   Miller said it has never opened the Trenton brewery because beer
demand flattened out nationally and the plant's production has not
been needed. But sales figures have perked up in recent months,
company officials said.

<HEAD>Fannie Mae Income Up 41 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fannie Mae, a secondary mortgage-market
company, said Thursday that earnings rose 41 percent in the
July-September quarter, in part because of declining home
foreclosures.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association, as the company is
more formally known, reported net income of $299.5 million in the
third quarter, or $1.15 per share, up from $211.9 million, or 80
cents a share a year earlier. It was the 11th consecutive increase
in quarterly profits.
   Earnings were $289.6 million in the second quarter and for the
first nine months of the year were $865.7 million, the company
said.
   ``We are encouraged that our acquisitions of foreclosed
properties are down by 15 percent compared with the third quarter
of last year, while our inventory of foreclosed properties has
declined by more than 30 percent from its year-ago level,'' Fannie
Mae chairman David O. Maxwell said in a statement.
   Fannie Mae, which finances about one in every eight of the
nation's single-family home sales, purchases mortgages from
lenders. It holds some and packages others into securities for
resale to investors. Although it was chartered by Congress, it is
shareholder-owned.
   The company also attributed the latest rise in profits to a $9.6
million increase in guaranty fees and to an $8.6 million gain in
the difference between the interest it pays investors and the
interest it receives from mortgage payers.

<HEAD>One-Third of Saturn Buyers Seen Coming from GM</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. rolled out its
new Saturn cars Thursday, predicting they will lure more buyers
from the competition than from other GM divisions.
   GM created the Saturn to compete with Japanese imports that have
stolen a large part of the market from the Big Three automakers.
The car has a price tag and fuel efficiency rating that's
competitive with Japanese models.
   Don Hudler, Saturn Corp.'s vice president for sales and
marketing, said he expected 65 percent of the GM subsidiary's
first-year sales will be new business to GM. The rest would come
from current GM owners, probably owners of Chevrolets.
   But by the third year Saturn is on the market, 80 percent of its
sales will come from would-be buyers of imports or cars made by
domestic rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   ``We'll do better as our perception gets out there,'' Hudler
said after the official unveiling of Saturn's two- and four-door
cars. The ceremony took place in Spring Hill, Tenn., where the new
cars are made.
   Auto analysts long have questioned Saturn's lofty expectations
that a large number of its sales would come from import buyers.
Saturn's price range of $7,995 to $11,775 puts it in the same ball
park as a host of imports, as well as the Geo Prizm and the
Chevrolet Cavalier, both sold and serviced by Chevrolet dealers.
   Snatching a sale from Chevrolet may help Saturn, but does
nothing for GM's profits overall.
   Saturn was set up as a separate corporation within GM in January
1985 and since then, the new company's officials have been trying
to distance themselves, the Saturn plant and the cars from the
parent corporation.
   No GM corporate officials were at Thursday's official unveiling.
The ceremony, which took place at the end of the assembly line at
Saturn's plant 35 miles south of Nashville, appeared like a pep
rally for the company's 3,350 employees, or ``team members,'' as
workers refer to themselves.
   As a trio of new cars were driven off the line and into a
shipping area, hundreds of workers cheered.
   About 1,000 cars will be in dealerships or on their way when
Saturn officially goes on sale Oct. 25 in 30 retailers, mostly in
the South and West. The company expects nationwide availability
through about 130 dealerships a year from now.
   Three to four weeks before the cars arrive in each of the
markets, Saturn will begin a print and broadcast advertising
campaign featuring testimonials from company workers and an
appearance by Emmett, a small blond dog belonging to one of
Saturn's transplanted workers.
   The television ads have a moody, slightly sentimental air. Not
all show the cars, but the ads are designed to increase awareness
of the Saturn brand, said Luana Floccuzio, the company's
advertising manager.
   ``It's getting into the hearts,'' she said.
   Saturn has set an ambitious goal for itself. When production is
fully operational, in about a year, the company expects sales to
reach about 250,000 a year. That's slightly less than the 255,159
Honda Civics that Americans bought in the 1990 model year that
ended last month.
   In price, the Saturn also is positioned against the Ford Escort,
Mazda Protege, Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla, Dodge Shadow and
Plymouth Sundance.
   Saturn is including a roadside assistance plan and a buy-back
program for owners.
   Hudler said the cars will carry no incentives.
   The company already is working on new Saturns, perhaps including
a station wagon and a convertible.

   Nissan executive Jerry Benefield was
among the crowd Thursday as Gov. Ned McWherter drove the first
Saturn out of the $1.9 billion General Motors Corp. plant.
   ``It's pretty,'' said the president of Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A., whose company makes Sentras and pickup
trucks 40 miles away.
   Not that Benefield wishes well to his new competitor. The
Saturn, GM's first new division in 58 years, produces an
American-made car that looks and drives like it's Japanese, and is
designed to compete with such companies as Nissan that have stolen
market share from the nation's No. 1 automaker.
   Saturn workers took a 45-minute break from the line on Thursday
for a ceremony to unveil the car. At an event that took on tones of
a pep rally, Saturn Corp. executives drove out of the plant in
three new cars destined for dealer showrooms for an Oct. 25 launch
date.
   The executives were joined by United Auto Workers officials at
the ceremony. Bobby Lee Thompson, assistant director of UAW Region
8, drew applause when he said he expects Saturn to ``surprise'' the
imports.
   ``I happen to believe in the Saturn team to get the job done.
But more important, I believe in you, the American public,''
Thompson said to more cheers.
   McWherter, who was state House speaker when GM announced in 1985
that Saturn was coming to Spring Hill 35 miles south of Nashville,
recalled that his father moved their family from Tennessee to
Michigan in search of work in the auto industry.
   ``I want to acknowledge the thousands and thousands of GM
stockholders for their commitment to Tennessee,'' he said.
   McWherter drove the first Saturn, a silver four-door sedan, out
of the plant to a waiting transport truck. With him were LeFauve,
Thompson and Dick Hoalcraft, the Saturn-UAW coordinator who
participates in decisions at the plant.
   Only 1,000 cars will be available for 30 dealers in the
Southeast and West to sell in two weeks, Saturn President Richard
G. ``Skip'' LeFauve said later.
   He would not give production figures but said the plant should
reach capacity of 250,000 cars a year by end of 1991.
   ``We're not going to be judged by the number of cars in the
showroom on Day One,'' said Don Hudler, Saturn's vice president for
sales, service and marketing. ``We want to be judged on quality and
customer satisfaction.''

<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc., in a move to reduce its
$4.8 billion debt load, said Thursday it is selling its credit
operations to GE Capital Corp.
   The step will lower the retailer's debt by $1.5 billion, Macy
said in a statement.
   The credit operations include Macy Credit Corp. and Macy
Receivables Funding Corp., which together have an asset value of
$100 million, Macy said.
   Macy was expected to take some kind of step toward reducing its
liabilities since it told its stockholders in July it was exploring
ways to lower or refinance its debt.
   The company, which went private in a $3.74 billion leveraged
buyout in 1986, suffered a disastrous Christmas last year and,
along with the rest of the retail industry, faces another bleak
holiday season.
   All retailers are dependent on Christmas sales for about half
their annual profits, but highly leveraged companies such as Macy
are particularly vulnerable when sales fall short of expectations.
   Macy is also reducing its debts by repurchasing its outstanding
bonds. Last month, the company said it planned to buy back
substantial amounts of its $1.6 billion in junk bonds, and would
consider selling a 20 percent equity stake to help finance the
repurchase.
   The retailer has already repurchased several other bond issues.
   By reducing its debt, Macy is also cutting its annual interest
bill of $595 million.
   Thursday's announcement came as welcome news to the junk bond
market, which bid up the price of Macy issues.
   GE Capital Corp. is a subsidiary of General Electric Co., which
is among Macy's stockholders. One of GE Capital's divisions is GE
Capital Retailer Financial Services, which handles credit
operations for more than 200 retailers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Oct. 1, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,324.2 billion from $3,315.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,087.7 billion from $4,085.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $829.3 billion from $821.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 4.9 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.8 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,301.6 billion, a 3.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,084.9 billion, up 1.6 percent, while M1
rose 4.3 percent to an average of $816.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   - The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $399 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$502 million the previous week.
   - The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $317.6 billion in the two-week period ended
Oct. 3, down from $318.8 billion two weeks earlier.

<TEXT>
   South East Coal Co. announced Thursday it
will permanently lay off about 400 workers in three eastern
Kentucky counties because a 6{-year legal battle has ``bled this
company white.''
   The layoffs at Kentucky's third-largest independent coal
producer were among the largest to jolt the eastern Kentucky
coalfields in years, said Bill Weinberg, chairman of the East
Kentucky Economic Development and Jobs Creation Corp.
   ``It's going to make hard times even harder for the short
haul,'' said Weinberg.
   South East President Harry LaViers Jr. announced the layoffs in
a prepared statement. He and other company officials did not return
repeated telephone calls for comment.
   On Aug. 10, South East warned its 830 workers they could be laid
off because of severe financial problems brought on by a legal
battle with Kentucky Utilities Co., its largest customer.
   In 1984, Kentucky Utilities won a $79 million judgment against
South East in a coal contract dispute. A Fayette Circuit judge
ordered South East to place $36 million in an escrow account until
appeals are resolved.
   ``This is a continuing tragedy for our workers, and for eastern
Kentucky, but our difficulties with Kentucky Utilities have bled
this company white,'' LaViers' statement said.
   The layoffs would be distributed among South East's four
underground mines in Knott and Letcher counties and a coal
preparation plant in Estill County. David Maggard of Millstone, a
repairman in Letcher County, said many workers with seniority were
dismissed over lesser experienced employees.
   ``It just looks like to me they picked on a lot of the union
people,'' said Maggard, a negotiating team member of United Mine
Workers Local No. 3007.
   After a bitter campaign, the UMW in July won the right to
represent South East's workers in bargaining talks. Contract talks
have been stalled because South East has challenged the union vote.
   LaViers' statement said some of the layoffs ``were made
necessary by an exchange, presently being negotiated, of some of
its assets in return for the assumption of part of its bank debt.''
   The exchange was an attempt to avert bankruptcy, he said. The
statement didn't identify the other party involved in the exchange.
   ``We are trying to preserve part of the company and some of the
jobs. Our creditor banks insist that something must be done to pay
them, now. We are trying to achieve that,'' LaViers said.
   No further layoffs are planned, he said.
   Statements of dire economic hardship puzzled several workers.
South East has been spending large amounts of money improving its
mines and facilities, they said.
   ``If they're hurting for money, they're certainly not showing it
in Irvine,'' said Earl Howell, president of UMW Local No. 3008 in
Estill County.

<HEAD>MCI Offers Plan to Stop Unauthorized Switching of Long-Distance
Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. offered the federal
government a plan Thursday to put a hold on telemarketers who
switch phone customers' long-distance service without their
permission.
   This customer switching, known as ``slamming,'' has generated
tens of thousands of complaints to state and federal telephone
regulators, particularly in the wake of recent advertising wars
between MCI, US Sprint and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   With all three leading long-distance carriers now offering about
the same prices, they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
on advertising and telemarketing trying to lure customers from
their rivals.
   AT&amp;T has about 65 percent of the market, MCI about 14 percent
and Sprint about 10 percent, with the remainder taken by several
hundred smaller companies. AT&amp;T had about 90 percent of the market
when it was broken up in 1984.
   MCI called on the Federal Communications Commission to establish
uniform, minimum disclosures in all telephone sales solicitations;
monitor procedures for phone solicitors; independently verify sales
to insure the customer has authorized a change in service; conduct
independent audits; and ensure ``free and convenient return to the
original long-distance carrier in the case of unauthorized service
conversion.''
   Customers typically pay $5 to change services now.
   Eugene Eidenberg, MCI executive vice president, said the plan
``will create a national standard to protect consumers while still
preserving the competition that has brought them better service in
the long-distance industry at lower prices.''
   MCI said its proposal should supersede a rival AT&amp;T proposal to
the FCC that would require each customer to sign a form prior to
being switched to a new long-distance carrier.
   AT&amp;T in January sued MCI and MCI's telemarketing agent, Pioneer
Teletechnologies of Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, over slamming, claiming
the companies had used misleading or false information to persuade
AT&amp;T customers to switch to MCI.
   MCI and Pioneer both denied any wrongdoing, and the suit is
pending in U.S. District Court in Washington.
   When the lawsuit was filed, MCI said 100,000 AT&amp;T customers a
week were switching to MCI because it offered better service. But
AT&amp;T's suit said MCI agents were telling AT&amp;T customers that MCI
was merging with AT&amp;T or that AT&amp;T was going out of business.
   Telemarketers, according to industry analysts, often prey on the
elderly, the hard of hearing or those who don't speak English well.
   FCC rules now require only that long-distance carriers provide
local phone companies with written verification from customers, if
the local phone company asks for proof.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on government
information, justice and agriculture will hold hearings on slamming
next Wednesday, according to aides to the subcommittee's chairman,
Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies on
concern about the health of U.S. banks and the belief among foreign
traders that the United States is headed for a sharp recession.
   Gold finished mixed in world trading, while silver continued its
slide to levels not seen in 13 years.
   The dollar fared well in European trading on increased anxieties
over the Persian Gulf crisis. But it dropped in New York as
concerns about U.S. banks intensified on Chemical Bank's move to
cut its common stock dividend to 25 cents a share after posting a
third-quarter loss of $43.7 million.
   ``It's down hard today,'' Marc Chandler, senior strategist with
the consulting firm IDEA in New York, said of the dollar.
   He said other factors influencing its drop included a general
bearishness in the market, continued confusion in federal budget
negotiations and tensions in the Middle East.
   ``We also continue to hear talk of Japanese life insurance
companies raising their dollar hedge ratios,'' Chandler said.
``That means they're selling more dollars to reduce their currency
risk.''
   In New York, the dollar closed at 129.47 yen, down from
Wednesday's 129.48. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.95
Japanese yen, unchanged from its closing rate on Tuesday before
Wednesday's Sports Day national holiday. In London late Thursday
the dollar closed at the same rate.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.9640 late Thursday, cheaper
for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.9755. But in New York, it cost
$1.9775 to buy one pound, up from $1.9694 late Wednesday.
   Other selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday rates included: 1.5138 German marks, down from 1.5278;
1.2730 Swiss francs, down from 1.2810; 5.0705 French francs, down
from 5.1145; 1,134.75 Italian lire, down from 1,145.00; and 1.1468
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1491.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday
included: 1.5330 German marks, up from 1.5285; 1.2910 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2785; 5.1292 French francs, up from 5.1160; 1.7280 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7225; 1,147.25 Italian lire, up from 1,143.25;
1.1512 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1495.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery rose $1.60 to settle at $389.70 a troy ounce. Republic
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $391.00, up
$2.75 an ounce from late Wednesday.
   Gold closed in London at a bid $389.75 a troy ounce, down from
$390.25 late Wednesday. The late bid price in Zurich was $389.60,
down from $390.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $390.05, down from $392.15.
   Silver continued its slide on the Comex. Silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.235 a troy ounce, down further from
Wednesday's sharp drop to $4.409 - its lowest level since August
1977. Silver traded late in London at a bid $4.28 a troy ounce,
down from $4.53 Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Dwindling U.S. stockpiles, looming cold weather
and a British warning of a Persian Gulf conflagration combined to
drive oil prices back over $40 a barrel Thursday to a new record
close in hectic futures trading.
   ``It's a market that reacts emotionally,'' said Bob Baker, an
oil-trading specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York. ``It's going to stay that way as long as we have 200,000-plus
troops out there.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November-delivery price
of light sweet crude, the benchmark grade of oil, jumped $1.73 a
barrel to close at $40.42, eclipsing the previous record of $40.40
set Tuesday. Later-delivery months also advanced strongly.
   The rise erased the decline a day earlier when traders dumped
oil contracts on an unfounded rumor about the death of Saddam
Hussein.
   The Iraqi leader's seizure of neighboring Kuwait more than two
months ago led to an unprecedented U.S. military buildup in the
petroleum-rich region and has doubled the price of oil since
midsummer.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also surged Thursday.
The most notable increase was in wholesale home heating oil for
November delivery, which jumped 3.80 cents a gallon to $1.0485.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery jumped 2.4
cents a gallon to close at 96 cents, and natural gas rose 2 cents
per 1,000 cubic feet to $1.96.
   Oil-market strategists said buyers plunged in at the opening of
trading, motivated partly by a report from the American Petroleum
Institute released after the close of trading Wednesday.
   API, an industry trade group, said its weekly tally of domestic
supplies showed a 4.2 million barrel drop in crude stockpiles and a
1.5 million barrel drop in distillates, which includes heating oil.
The declines were considered unusually steep, particularly at a
time when seasonal demand for energy to heat homes is increasing.
   The report aggravated fears that the United States, which
imports half its oil, was growing more vulnerable to shortages as
the chances of a Persian Gulf war increased, which could cut off
oil supplies completely from that area.
   Britain's Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd heightened war fears in
the oil pits by telling fellow politicians in Britain that force
would be used to evict the Iraqis from Kuwait if they didn't leave
voluntarily.
   Hurd said that without a united front against Iraq, ``then we
shall be back in a world of anarchy punctuated by explosions of
force.''
   Thomas Blakeslee, an energy analyst at the Pegasus Econometric
Group in Hoboken, N.J., said the rhetoric unnerved professional
traders, even though Hurd's remarks were basically no different
than warnings the United States has issued to Iraq.
   ``Traders don't sit down and think about that type of thing,''
Blakeslee said. ``They don't have time.''

<TEXT>
   Recession fears have sent silver and platinum
plummeting in the last two days, and analysts say silver isn't
looking quite like the precious metal it used to be.
   The spot price of silver fell 25.5 cents, or 5.6 percent, to
$4.28 a troy ounce on Thursday from a late bid of $4.535 in London
Wednesday.
   Thursday's late price was the lowest for silver since 1976, when
the metal dipped as low as $3.82, according to Shearson Lehman
Brothers Ltd.
   ``It's no longer a precious metal, it's an industrial metal,''
said Nick Hatch, a mining analyst at the London investment firm
James Capel and Co.
   ``Both silver and platinum are suffering from mounting fears of
an economic downturn,'' added Thomas Butler, a precious metals
analyst at the London investment firm Samuel Montagu and Co.
   ``Both these metals have very strong industrial bases and fears
that a recession may emerge soon are obviously undermining
prices,'' he said.
   The spot price of platinum fell $23.50, or 5.3 percent, to
$418.75 an ounce in London from $442.25 an ounce late Wednesday.
That was its lowest since 1985, when the price reached $244,
Shearson said.
   Silver rose as high at $35 an ounce in 1980 when the Hunt
brothers of Texas tried to corner the silver market, Hatch said. It
has fallen fairly steadily since.
   Analysts said silver is hurting lately because of the economic
downturn that's affecting consumers to manufacturers. Silver is
most widely used in the photographic industry, where demand is
down, Hatch said. Silverware is a luxury item that's also coming
under pressure from the economic slowdown, he said.
   There's also an abundance of silver. About 70 percent is
produced as a byproduct of gold and other mining, Butler said. That
means supply doesn't respond to changes in demand.
   Silver mines in Chile, Alaska and Nevada also are increasing
production, and there's a lot of scrap being recovered, Hatch said.
   This year's total demand will come to 14,850 tons, surpassing
expected supply of 14,400 tons, Hatch said. But he said there's a
stockpile of roughly 10,000 tons.
   In the past, investors tended to snap up oversupply, Butler
said. But that's no longer the case, he said.
   ``The long-term love affair with silver seems to be over,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Plastics Industry Looks To Recycling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As public concern mounts over the volume of
packing materials, sandwich boxes and yogurt containers en route to
landfills, plastic industry leaders have been thinking more about
recycling to make the industry's outlook a little greener.
   In a recent survey, nearly 20 percent of Midwestern plastic
industry leaders ranked environmental issues as having the greatest
future impact on manufacturing. The survey - conducted by the
Chicago-based Gary Siegel Organization for the investment firm of
Berger, Goldstein Capital Group Inc. - found that the 6,500
industry executives polled cited solid waste disposal, ecological
concerns and biodegradable products as top concerns.
   ``I think it's a combination of the industry being responsible
and realizing that consumers are looking for these kind of
recyclable products,'' said Bailey Condrey Jr., spokesman for the
Council for Solid Waste Solutions.
   ``The companies want to maintain their market share by providing
what customers want,'' said Condrey, whose Washington-based council
consists of 26 plastic-producing companies.
   But some environmentalists say the solution is cutting the
initial use of plastics, not reusing them.
   ``I don't think recycling plastics is the total answer to the
waste disposal problem,'' said Kevin Greene, a researcher with the
Chicago-based Citizens for a Better Environment. ``First we must
cut down on the excessive use of packaging, plastic or otherwise.''
   Plastic recycling today involves mostly food service and
packaging products made of polystyrene plastic, said James
Schneiders, president of National Polystyrene Recycling Co. In the
late 1980s, his company opened one of the nation's first
polystyrene recycling plants, in Leominster, Mass.
   In recycling, the materials are cleaned and ground into resin
pellets, which then are used alone or in combination with virgin
materials to produce plastic products.
   ``We're really benefiting society in two ways - by reusing
materials that still have life in them and by cutting the use of
primary material,'' Schneiders said.
   Environmentalists still have doubts. Because plastic products
are so bulky they are difficult to collect and transport for
recycling, Greene said. He also said Food and Drug Administration
regulation prohibits the use of recycled products in most food
packaging.
   ``We still favor the use of glass and aluminum,'' Greene said.
``Those products can be recycled into the same food and beverage
containers.
   Some waste disposal experts say plastics in landfills aren't
that big a problem, however.
   ``Plastics are among the most innocuous materials in
landfills,'' said Allen Blakey, spokesman for the National Solid
Waste Management Association. ``In many ways they're the perfect
item to put into landfill because they don't decay'' and produce
toxic byproducts.
   Blakey said about 20 percent, or 14.4 million tons, of the waste
put in landfills in 1988 came from plastics. Paper products were
the largest contributor with 34 percent, he said.

   Orange juice futures traders braced for a price collapse after
the government on Thursday projected a 50 percent increase in
Florida orange production this season, barring another significant
freeze.
   Consumers should see lower prices in grocery store freezer cases
within weeks as retailers try to reduce their inventories of frozen
concentrate, analysts said.
   Orange juice futures fell sharply on the New York Cotton
Exchange ahead of the report and analysts predicted the near-term
contract, for delivery in November, would plunge Friday its
permitted daily limit of 10 cents.
   On other commodity markets Thursday, oil futures surged; silver
futures continued to plummet; gold rose slightly; grains and
soybeans retreated; cattle futures fell; and pork futures were
mixed.
   Futures prices for wholesale frozen concentrated orange juice
settled .85 cent to 2.55 cents lower in New York with November at
$1.299 a pound.
   Several analysts said orange juice futures likely will keep
falling to less than $1 a pound, a four-year low, in reaction to
the Agriculture Department's projection for a Florida orange
harvest of 165 million 90-pound boxes.
   Florida growers harvested 110.2 million boxes last season after
a severe Christmastime freeze. Most analysts had expected the USDA
projection, which was the first government estimate of the new
season, to be around 132 million boxes.
   ``No one anticipated this figure,'' said analyst Celeste
Georkakis of Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   The government projected a total U.S. orange harvest of 231
million boxes.
   The USDA projected an increase in Florida orange juice yield to
1.52 gallons of juice per box compared with 1.23 gallons per box
last year.
   Judith Ganes, orange juice analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said
retailers will be forced to drop proces to stimulate demand.
   ``They're going to have to move the product,'' she said.
   Retail prices may not drop sharply until late winter, after the
threat of frost damage is past, but moderate price reductions are
likely ``almost immediately,'' said analyst Sandra Kaul of Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Elsewhere, oil prices soared on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting fears of war in the Middle East and a trade
group report that showed an unexpected decline in U.S. supplies of
crude oil.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 52 cents to $1.73 higher with
November at $40.42 a barrel; heating oil was 1.05 cents to 3.8
cents higher with November at $1.0485 a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .10 cent to 2.4 cents higher with Noember at 96 cents a
gallon.
   Inflation jitters helped pull gold futures higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange but silver tumbled to a 14-year low, reflecting
burdensome supplies and slack demand for the metal.
   Gold finished $1.40 to $1.60 higher with October at $389.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 17.4 cents to 19.2 cents lower with October
at $4.235 a troy ounce.
   Most grain and soybean futures prices fell on the Chicago Board
of Trade, reflecting bearish export signals in the wheat market and
position-evening ahead of a government crop report.
   In the report, the USDA projected the 1990 U.S. corn harvst at
8.02 billion bushels compared with its September estimate of 8.12
billion and market expectations averaging 8.06 billion.
   The USDA projected soybean production of 1.82 billion bushels
compared with the September estimate of 1.84 billion and market
expectations averaging 1.83 billion.
   Analysts predicted a slight opening drop in corn and bean
futures Friday in reaction to the report.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents to 5 cents lower with December at
$2.71\ a bushel; corn was 2} cents to 4\ cents lower with December
at $2.32} a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3\ cents lower with
December at $1.19} a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents lower to 5
cents higher with November at $6.20{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle finished .20
cent lower to .68 cent higher with October at 78.52 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .33 cent to .80 cent lower with October at 87.37
cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent lower to .28 cent higher
with October at 56.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1
cent to 1.25 cents higher with February at 64.40 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Chemical Bank Loses $43.7 Million, Cuts Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp. reporeed a $43.7 million
third-quarter loss Thursday and cut its dividend by more than half,
another sign of painful times in the domestic banking business.
   The loss by the nation's 6th-largest banking company was an
improvement over a year earlier but still reflected the rise in
shaky loans and a softening economy that have afflicted several
leading U.S. banks in recent months.
   ``Chemical Bank is struggling, as are other banks, with a
deteriorating operating environment and the declining real estate
market in the Northeast,'' said James McDermott, a banking analyst
at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, a New York investment firm.
   Chemical said the results stemmed primarily from a $250 million
increase in its reserves for loan losses and a $18.8 million
accounting charge to cover the cost of shutting down its securities
trading business in Switzerland and Japan, a move that had been
announced previously.
   It also reported an improvement in the Texas Commerce Bancshares
subsidiary, which earned $22.9 million. By contrast, Texas Commerce
lost $372.4 million in the year-earlier quarter, which contributed
to a loss of $824.6 million by the parent company during that
period.
   Chemical said it dropped the quarterly dividend from 68 cents a
share to 25 cents to ``retain a higher level of common equity to
support consistent growth in its profitable core businesses.''
   The dividend cut had not been unexpected. Several leading banks,
notably No. 2 Chase Manhattan, have taken the painful step of
cutting dividends recently to help strengthen their financial
structures.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Chemical said it earned
$221.1 million or $1.83 a share, vs. a loss of $578.1 million in
the year-earlier period.
   The Bank of New York, meanwhile, said it earned $71 million or
90 cents a share in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, vs. a $271
million loss a year earlier.
   The 11th-largest U.S. banking company said it attributed the
performance partly to an improvement in efficiency stemming from
its acquisition of Irving Bank Corp. in 1989.
   Still, the bank said earnings were hurt by shaky real estate
loans and Latin American debt, which led the company to increase
its loan-loss provision by $113 million.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, net income was $243 million,
compared with a loss of $56 million for the same period last year.

<HEAD>Keating Lawyers, Rejected in State Court, Ask Federal Court to
Lower Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rejected three times in state courts, lawyers
for Charles H. Keating Jr. asked a federal court judge Thursday to
reduce the jailed financier's $5 million bail.
   ``The district attorney's office did not offer a shred of
evidence to support a finding that Keating is a flight risk,'' the
U.S. District Court petition said.
   Keating's attorneys said the $5 million bail set by Superior
Court Judge Gary Klausner was excessive and unconstitutional, and
argued Keating couldn't adequately defend himself against fraud
charges as long as he was in jail.
   On Wednesday, the California Supreme Court refused to consider
lowering bail for the key figure in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
collapse.
   Keating, a 66-year-old Arizona developer, has remained at a Los
Angeles jail since his indictment last month on charges of
misleading investors about the security of junk bonds sold at the
failed Lincoln Savings.
   Keating was chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's
Phoenix-based parent company. Federal regulators took over the

taxpayers $2 billion.
   Keating pleaded innocent to the charges at a hearing last week.
A pretrial hearing was scheduled Monday.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Microelectronics Introduces `Multimedia' Chip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T Microelectronics on Thursday
unveiled a high-performance, low-cost computer chip for personal
computers and workstations that combines voice, audio, graphics and
modem functions.
   The DSP3210 chip, said to be compatible with Intel and Motorola
32-bit microprocessors that power IBM-compatible and Apple PCs,
allows computer users to work with video images and compact
disk-quality sound at the same time.
   ``The DSP3210 is designed for the emerging market in PCs and
workstations that let users escape the limitations of
low-resolution images and beep-quality sounds,'' said Kreg Ulery,
AT&amp;T's multimedia marketing manager.
   ``In fact, we expect the DSP3210 to become the worldwide
standard architecture for multimedia applications,'' he said.
   AT&amp;T plans to start producting the chip in the fourth quarter of
1991. It is expected to cost less than $50 in quantities of
100,000.
   The announcement, made at the Microprocessor Forum West seminar,
is the latest indication that the industry is preparing a push into
multimedia computing devices.
   The industry, including IBM and Apple Computer, is working to
incorporate multimedia functions into the PCs and workstations they
are developing. Next Computer Inc. already sells a computer with
some multimedia capability using a Motorola Inc. digital signal
processor.
   Motorola said its chip, the $200 96002, is more powerful than
AT&amp;T's.
   Industry observers called AT&amp;T's new product significant.
   ``The PC industry hasn't had a high-powered digital signal
processor that can integrate all these functions at the motherboard
level,'' said Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative
Strategies, a Santa Clara research firm.
   Although there are other digital signal processors on the
market, AT&amp;T's new chip brings ``a fairly high level of performance
at a price that makes it economically feasible to include it as a
standard device in a PC,'' said Michael Slater, editor of
Microprocessor report.

   The stock market dropped sharply for the third
straight session Thursday, hitting a new 18-month low in an
atmosphere of dismay about the outlook for business and the
government's finances.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 42.82 to 2,365.10,
bringing its loss over the past three days to 158.66 points.
   That marked the lowest close for the average since it stood at
2,337.79 on April 17, 1989.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
301 up, 1,290 down and 416 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 180.06 million
shares, against 167.89 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 219.03 million shares.
   Analysts said there was little in the news to relieve the gloom
that has gripped the market since midsummer.
   The price of crude-oil for November delivery climbed $1.73 a
barrel, to $40.42 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Recession worries have kept mounting of late as investors await
the peak flow of corporate earnings reports for the third quarter,
due over the next couple of weeks.
   But economic weakness hasn't so far brought any downward
pressure on long-term interest rates.
   Brokers also said market participants were frustrated by the
slow progress and many twists and turns of efforts in Washington
toward a plan to narrow the federal budget deficit.
   Meanwhile, fresh evidence emerged of the troubles afflicting the
banking industry. Chemical Banking of New York posted a $43.7
million loss for the third quarter and cut its quarterly dividend
from 68 cents a share to 25 cents a share.
   Chemical's stock fell \ to 14}. Among other prominent
money-center banking issues, Citicorp dropped { to 13|; Chase
Manhattan &rsqb; to 12; J.P. Morgan } to 32&lsqb;, and Manufacturers Hanover
1~ to 20.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included Aluminum Co. of
America, down 2 at 54{; Philip Morris, down } at 44\; General
Electric, down } at 51\, and International Business Machines, down
2{ at 101.
   Golden Valley Microwave Foods, which said it expected to report
flat earnings and lower sales for the third quarter, slumped 2 to
8{
   The Limited dropped { to 12 in active trading. The company said
its margins were somewhat lower in the third quarter than they had
been in the corresponding period last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $51.40 billion, or 1.82
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.77 to 162.20.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 6.25 to 346.86, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.93 at 295.46.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 7.64 to 325.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 293.71, down 5.55.

<HEAD>UAL Offers Employees New Stock Ownership Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. on Thursday offered employees a
discount stock-purchase program that union officials said could
give workers a 20 percent stake in the airline company.
   The board of directors earlier this week rebuffed the unions'
bid for full employee ownership.
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins said he did not know if the 20 percent
limit to the stock ownership cited by the unions is correct. Nor
did he know how much stock employees now own.
   The company made a brief reference to the stock plan in a letter
to employees on Wednesday, then added a few details in a bulletin
board announcement on Thursday.
   It said that shortly after the first of the year, employees will
be offered UAL stock at a 15 percent discount from the market
price. In addition, the company will offer expanded stock-purchase
rights to salaried and management employees.
   ``We believe these changes will be attractive for employees who
wish to acquire United stock and share in the future successes of
United through ownership,'' said Paul George, senior vice president
for human resources.
   The three principal unions representing United Airlines
employees expressed reservations about the plan.
   ``It is ironic that UAL proposes to sell 20 percent of its stock
to its employees at a discount only two days after rejecting our
offer to buy all of the stock at a significant premium above the
current market price,'' heads of the pilots, machinists and flight
attendants unions said in a statement.
   They said that while they favor employee ownership of stock,
``management's proposal for limited stock ownership raises numerous
issues which must be addressed in negotiations.''
   Tuesday's rejection of a bid for full employee ownership marked
the fourth failed take-over attempt in 3{ years.
   The employee group was unable to arrange financing by the
Tuesday deadline for the $201-a-share, $4.38 billion, offer the
board accepted in principle in April.
   Despite the lack of bank financing, the buyout group presented
the board with two other offers, both of which were rejected.

<HEAD>Both Sides Claim Victory in Intel-Advanced Micro Devices Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arbitrator Thursday ruled Intel
Corp. did not act in good faith in a dispute with Advanced Micro
Devices over the rights to Intel's highly profitable 386
microprocessor.
   The arbitrator, retired Superior Court Judge J. Barton Phelps,
however, stopped short of ordering Intel to transfer the chip's
rights to AMD. Phelps said remedies will be considered in a hearing
to begin Nov. 15.
   Both sides claimed victory in the dispute over a 1982 contract
under which the companies were to trade technology.
   Advanced Micro initiated the arbitration, seeking to require
Intel to transfer products including the 386 chip rights to AMD,
and also asked for $1 billion in damages.
   Intel has contended that AMD failed to develop acceptable
products under the agreement and, therefore, is not entitled to
take any Intel products.
   Phelps decided that Intel had provided ``a classic example of a
breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, preaching
good faith but practicing duplicity.''
   W.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive officer of AMD,
said he was confident the company will get monetary damages as well
as rights to the 386 chip durin the remedies hearing.
   F. Thomas Dunlap Jr., Intel general counsel, said the company
was pleased the decision did not order the microprocessor's
transfer.
   ``Although the decision does not completely foreclose the
possibility of future product transfers, the concept of
product-for-product exchange still applies. Intel continues to
believe that the contract specifically limits remedies which can be
awarded and that Intel's position on both damages and product
transfers will prevail,'' Dunlap said.
   The 1982 exchange agreement was amended in 1984 and terminated
in 1987.
   In the remedies hearing, AMD will ask for more than $500 million
in damages and rights to the microprocessor, the company said.

   UNDATED - The return of capitalism to Eastern Europe presents a
potentially vast new market for Western computer makers, a
development that could boost a vital U.S. export industry. Computer
and software companies could be among the early beneficiaries of
modernization drives in these formerly communist nations since
computers are a crucial ingredient in banking, telephone and
transportation systems - all targets for major investment. ``You
can't have a modern economy without massive infusions of
information technology,'' says one executive.
