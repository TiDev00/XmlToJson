<HEAD>Gas Company Dropping Bill For Quayle Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia Gas is dropping its request to
make natural-gas customers pay for costs associated with a visit by
Vice President Dan Quayle last year.
   Columbia Gas had sought customer reimbursement for $703,000 in
costs related to the promotion of a bus powered by natural gas.
Quayle unveiled the bus during a visit to Ohio on Sept. 8.
   The change in the company's position came Friday, a day after
Quayle's press secretary said the vice president was sending a
letter to Columbia Gas asking that the cost be dropped from a $42
million rate-increase request pending before state utility
regulators.
   Quayle said the company's attempt to recover the costs was
``outrageous.''
   Columbia Gas spokesman Alan Crockett said the company's decision
to withdraw its request for the reimbursement ``had nothing to do
with the vice president.''
   The company said in a statement: ``Certainly, we want to assure
that the many benefits of clean air technologies such as the
natural gas bus are kept in proper focus. The attention that now
surrounds our request to recover these costs has shifted the focus
of our original intent in developing this important new
technology.''
   Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said the vice
president had no idea the bus costs might be passed to gas
customers. Beckwith said Quayle assumed the utility would absorb
the costs.
   ``The use of my visit to Columbus as an excuse to soak the
ratepayers is outrageous,'' Beckwith quoted Quayle as saying.
   Of the $703,000 reimbursement, Ohio customers were asked to pick
up $428,839 of the bill, with the remainder spread among customers
in Kentucky, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania.

   Here are some facts, figures and
theories about Venus, the planet visited early today by the
Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or 95 percent as wide as Earth, and
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about 82 percent as much as Earth.
   ATMOSPHERE: About 96 percent carbon dioxide and most of the rest
nitrogen, but with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and water vapor.
The atmosphere traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that
scientists believe evaporated liquid water long ago.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Crushing atmospheric pressure 90 times that on Earth.
   DAY LENGTH: Venus rotates on its axis very slowly, so one day on
Venus equals 243 Earth days. Its rotation is retrograde, so the sun
rises in the west and sets in the east.
   YEAR LENGTH: Venus orbits the sun once every 225 Earth days.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to Earth
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, Venus is the
brightest object in Earth's skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in Venus' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on Earth.
   GRAVITY: About 89 percent as strong as on Earth.

   Here are key events for the Galileo
spacecraft's looping, six-year trip to Jupiter, the solar system's
largest planet:
   Oct. 18, 1989 _ Galileo is released from the cargo bay of space
shuttle Atlantis, then an Inertial Upper Stage booster launches the
spacecraft on its long voyage.
   Nov. 9-11, 1989 _ Controllers order multiple firings of
Galileo's thrusters for the first of about 30 course correction
maneuvers.
   Dec. 22, 1989 _ Thrusters fire again for second course
correction.
   Feb. 9, 1990 _ Galileo swoops near Venus for its first ``gravity
assist'' maneuver, using the planet's gravity to increase the
spacecraft's speed to help it reach Jupiter. Galileo makes photos
and measurements of Venus, storing them on an onboard recorder.
   Late October 1990 _ Galileo plays back to Earth the photos and
measurements it made near Venus.
   Dec. 8, 1990 _ Galileo passes within 600 miles of Earth, making
photos and measurements during its second ``gravity assist''
maneuver, which will help aim it toward Jupiter.
   Oct. 29, 1991 _ The spacecraft swoops within 600 miles of
asteroid Gaspra, taking pictures and measurements.
   Dec. 8, 1992 _ Galileo zooms about 185 miles above Earth's
surface in the third and final ``gravity assist'' maneuver needed
to hurl it toward Jupiter.
   Aug. 28, 1993 _ If Galileo has adequate propellant supplies, it
passes 600 miles from asteroid Ida for photos and measurements.
   July 1995 _ The spacecraft separates into a 760-pound Galileo
probe and a 4,890-pound Galileo orbiter. Both continue toward
Jupiter.
   Dec. 7, 1995 _ The probe and orbiter arrive at Jupiter. The
probe plunges into the planet's atmosphere, relaying measurements
to the orbiter, then is destroyed by intense atmospheric pressure.
The orbiter speeds about 600 miles from the moon Io and its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes and geysers, then goes into orbit around
Jupiter.
   December 1995-October 1997 _ The orbiter circles Jupiter, making
photos and measurements of the giant planet and the moons Europa,
Ganymede and Callisto.

   To his lawyer, he's Johnny; to the media, the
Dapper Don; to authorities, the Gambino crime family boss.
   Call him what you like, but John Joseph Gotti Jr. has captured
the public imagination like no gangster since Capone.
   His acquittal Friday of conspiracy and assault in the shooting
of a union official only added to his growing aura of
invincibility, which started when predecessor Paul Castellano was
gunned down in December 1985.
   Since that slaying, Gotti's beaten a pair of government cases
while allegedly running the nation's most powerful mob
organization. And he has become America's best-known crime figure.
   His penchant for $1,800 suits, silk shirts and diamond pinkie
rings have contributed to his image as a throwback to the mobsters
of old.
   Despite continual FBI surveillance, Gotti keeps a high profile,
making daily trips to hangouts like the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club
in the borough of Queens and the Ravenite Social Club in Manhattan.
He dines out frequently and enjoys Italian food, as his stocky
5-foot-10 build attests.
   Phone taps have revealed Gotti to be hot-tempered, with a taste
for gambling. Many of his friends and reputed crime associates date
to his childhood; one of them is actor Ray Sharkey, who portrayed
mob boss Sonny Steelgrave on the television show ``Wiseguy.''
   Sharkey and Gotti grew up in the same Brooklyn neighborhood.
They ate together at a restaurant recently after they hugged and
kissed in court.
   ``What do you think _ (defense lawyer) Bruce Cutler is my only
friend?'' Gotti told reporters who expressed surprise.
   Gotti, who turns 50 in October, lives with his wife of 29 years,
Victoria. All agree he is a devoted family man, though law
enforcement officials say the family to whom he is devoted is the
Gambino organization.
   In 1979, Gotti suffered a family tragedy _ the death of his
12-year-old son Frank, who was riding a motorbike when he was
struck by a neighbor's car. The accident was a tragedy for the
neighbor, too: He disappeared four months later and has never been
found.
   Authorities say another death _ no accident _ vaulted Gotti into
the position of capo di tutti capi: the bold executions of
Castellano and bodyguard Thomas Bilotti outside a Manhattan steak
house on Dec. 16, 1985.
   No one has ever been charged with his murder. But within days of
the Castellano hit, police detectives reported seeing 100 organized
crime figures paying their respects to Gotti.
   Since then, his lifestyle has been consistent with the
stereotypical image of a Mafia don. He travels in a black stretch
Mercedes, and he wears his expensive suits with matching ties and
handkerchiefs.
   Yet Gotti claims he is a salesman for the Arc Plumbing &amp; Heating
Co. of Queens. His attorney, Cutler, says Gotti is ``nothing more
than an upfront guy who doesn't fit into their preconceptions of a
nine-to-fiver.''
   ``So he didn't go to Harvard. So he gambled a little. That makes
him a mob leader?'' asked Cutler. ``The government is very, very
resentful of his popularity, jealous of him.''
   There is no questioning Gotti's popularity in his Queens
neighborhood. He returned like a conquering hero after his
acquittal on racketeering charges in 1987; during the carpenters
union assault trial, local merchants strung a banner across 101st
Street wishing him luck.
   Every year, he funds a Fourth of July street party in Queens;
hordes of police have tried to stop the fireworks there, to no
avail.
   Gotti reputedly earned his mob stripes with the 1973 slaying of
James McBratney in a Staten Island bar. He did two years in jail
for the slaying after pleading guilty to attempted manslaughter in
a plea-bargaining agreement.
   During the 1960s, Gotti was jailed twice: one year for grand
larceny and 3{ years for hijacking.
   But lately, his legal luck has changed. His only convictions in
the past five years are traffic violations; with Cutler's help, he
beat a massive federal racketeering and conspiracy case.
   The Dapper Don also beat an assault charge when the alleged
victim _ after finding out who Gotti was _ testified he was unable
to identify his attackers. ``I Forgotti!'' headlined the New York
Post after the 1986 trial.
   The victories apparently convinced Gotti he had become the
Teflon Don, untouchable by the authorities. Gotti never even
flinched when dozens of law enforcement officers swooped down to
arrest him last year for the union shooting.
   An unflustered Gotti surveyed the situation and said:
   ``Three-to-one odds I beat this.''
   Once again, he was right.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The democratic uprisings that have swept
three continents stunned the world with their apparent suddenness,
but reform leaders say those impressions are misleading.
   ``The struggle for democratic freedoms is always long and never
easy,'' said Li Lu, a Chinese student leader who is on his
country's most wanted list and was forced to flee after the
massacre of protesters in Beijing last spring.
   Non-violent reform was the focus Friday as about 180 political
leaders, scholars and journalists from around the world met for the
first time to discuss the dramatic changes in recent months from
the Berlin Wall to Soweto.
   ``Everyone here is representative of different movements that
are constantly in the headlines,'' said Roger Powers of the
Cambridge-based Albert Einstein Institution, sponsor of the
three-day conference.
   ``Our contention is that you can't understand international
politics today without understanding nonviolent methods because
those methods are behind the changes going on everywhere around the
world,'' he said.
   Leaders and scholars of democratic movements in China, South
Africa, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and elsewhere spent the
day exchanging strategies and stories of reform.
   ``One of the principles of non-violence is to weigh down the
opponent until you outlast the resistance,'' said Patrick Lekota, a
leader of the United Democratic Front of South Africa. ``Each
campaign is a springboard for advance.''
   In South Africa, he said, boycotts, strikes and external
political, economic and moral pressure have taken the democratic
movement a long way toward fundamental reforms.
   President F.W. de Klerk made history last week by announcing the
most sweeping reforms since the country's apartheid system was put
in place in 1948.
   But Lekota said those changes were set in motion long before de
Klerk announced his dramatic initiatives, which include the planned
release of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
and the lifting of a ban on more than 20 outlawed anti-apartheid
groups.
   ``De Klerk did not just wake up one day with a heart of gold,''
he said. ``It was our steady pressure that took us to the point
where he could no longer ignore us.''
   Lu, who is studying at Columbia University, said the story in
China has been somewhat different but the movement's impact cannot
be overlooked and must not be misunderstood.
   ``The goal of the students was to make the people aware of their
situation,'' Lu said. ``... The next step is real, practical
change.''
   Such changes could also be spurred by the recent popular
uprisings across the Soviet bloc and radical changes in the Soviet
Union, where this week the Communists voted to end one-party rule,
Lu said.
   ``We have a very conservative dictatorship in China,'' he said.
``But they no longer have anywhere to hide. The changes are
everywhere around them.''
   Among the other panelists participating in Friday's session were
Raymundas Rayatskas, one of the founders of Lithuanian Popular
Front, and U Tin Maung Win, a leader of the Committee for the
Restoration of Democracy in Burma.
   Activists said the roads had been long and pitted for
non-violent movements that stretch back to the Chinese Cultural
Revolution of the 1960s, the Prague Spring of 1968 or the Soweto
riots of 1976.
   Political transformation is seldom swift, but the boycotts,
rallies and marches are fired by necessity, experts said.
   ``When people are poor, their stomachs empty and their minds
oppressed, they have no choice but to use non-violence as a
weapon,'' said Mubarak Awad of the Palestinian Center for the Study
of Nonviolence.

   Andy Rooney, the humorist suspended from CBS
News, says his troubles came about because ``gays decided to charge
me with racism.''
   Rooney said in a column distributed Friday that he was uncertain
about damage done to him by racial comments attributed to him in a
gay magazine.
   Rooney, who earlier was defended by former CBS news anchor
Walter Cronkite, also received support Friday from Fred W.
Friendly, a former president of CBS News.
   Rooney was interviewed by Chris Bull, a reporter with The
Advocate, a biweekly magazine based in Los Angeles. He was quoted
as saying that ``most people are born with equal intelligence, but
blacks have watered down their genes because the less intelligent
ones are the ones that have the most children. They drop out of
school early, do drugs and get pregnant.''
   ``I not only deny the quote attributed to me, I say the
quotation was made up by a young reporter who couldn't take
notes,'' Rooney wrote in his column.
   Bull, the reporter, said earlier this week that his quotations
of Rooney, taken down during a phone interview three weeks ago,
were accurate. He did not tape the interview.
   Rooney planned to continue writing his twice-weekly syndicated
humor column, which he said is distributed to about 260 newspapers.
   Rooney has worked in news and entertainment at CBS for 40 years
and has been the resident humorist at ``60 Minutes'' since 1978.
   He previously got in hot water with gay groups with a remark he
made in a Dec. 28 CBS special, ``A Year With Andy Rooney: 1989.''
   In that show, he said that, ``many of the ills which kill us are
self-induced,'' and then cited ``too much alcohol, too much food,
homosexual unions, cigarettes.''
   In his column distributed Friday, Rooney wrote, ``It is not
clear yet to me whether I have been destroyed or not, but I know
that a denial from anyone does not carry anywhere near the same
weight as an accusation. The accusation against me came from an
angry gay organization which had decided that, while the media
might be relatively indifferent to the complaint of gays that they
has been wronged, it is difficult for any news organization to
stand up against a charge of racism. So, in their organized
campaign against me _ hundreds of letters were addressed to ``CBS
National News'' _ gays decided to charge me with racism.
   ``Now they're angry because the race issue got me and the
homosexual issue did not.
   ``For all the hurt to me, I am even sorrier for the hurt to
gays, blacks and CBS News. None of them needs more trouble.''
   Friendly, now director of the Columbia University Seminars on
Media and Society, said in defending Rooney, ``Some of us who have
known Andy Rooney for 50 years _ 48 in my case _ know that Andy is
blunt in talking the truth. If Andy Rooney said he never said that,
I would believe it.''

   Fifteen years after the Communist
takeover, the ao dai, a traditional costume, is making a comeback
in Vietnamese schools, the Vietnam News Agency reported.
   Increasing numbers of schoolgirls in Ho Chi Minh City have been
wearing the long, flowing white garment, which was the traditional
school uniform until 1975, the agency reported.
   Until that year, Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, was the
capital of the U.S.-backed government of South Vietnam.
   A modified version of the ao dai has reappeared as a school
uniform for girls since last year, according to the report,
monitored in Bangkok.
   The re-adoption of the ao dai in schools comes under an effort
by authorities in Ho Chi Minh City to restore and develop national
identity, the report said.
   The agency quoted a 17-year-old student, Duong Thi Thanh Thanh,
as saying she ``saw in the white robe the symbol of both the
physical beauty and the finest virtues of Vietnamese women.''

   A wizened old man brandishing a plastic
bag containing six half-baked loaves of bread shouts ``1,000
pounds! Who pays higher?''
   ``1,200,'' said a hungry resident of the Christian enclave,
lunging at the bag.
   The $2.50 price tag, five times the regular amount, enrages the
other four men bidding for the scarce commodity and they chase the
auctioneer away with shouts of ``Thief! Thief!''
   Shelves in the few grocery stories that were open in the Furn
el-Shubbak and neighboring Ein Rummaneh residential areas, hard-hit
by fighting between rival Christian forces, were nearly empty
Friday.
   Hunger drove some residents to brave the sniper fire at the
crossing point between the Christian enclave and the city's Moslem
sector, and dozens of pushcart fruit and vegetable vendors did a
roaring business in the area.
   Since fighting broke out Jan. 30, at least 418 people have been
killed, most of them non-combatants. Almost 1,700 have been wounded
in the worst intra-Christian fighting in Lebanon's 15-year-old
civil war.
   The new confrontation lines between renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's
19,000 troops and Christian warlord Samir Geagea's 6,000-strong
Lebanese Forces militia have kept food distributors off the
streets. The troops are battling for control of the Christian
enclave north and northeast of Beirut.
   Tree branches, pieces of corrugated tin, shrapnel and glass
shards cover mines planted by the Lebanese Forces at entrances to
Furn el-Shubbak and Ein Rummaneh to block a possible tank thrust by
Aoun's troops.
   The camouflage is to protect those living in the area from
inadvertently stepping on a mine, while blowing up any tank trying
to venture forward.
   No cars can enter these areas.
   Pedestrians wave hysterically at civilians driving toward the
mined strip: ``Don't drive any closer and when you walk keep your
eyes on the ground. Watch out for suspicious-looking objects.''
   Lebanese Forces militiamen lurking on street corners and toting
Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles prevent reporters and
photographers from taking pictures without a visit to their
Kassardjian barracks in Ein Rummaneh ``for a permit.''
   The base withstood dozens of tank charges in the past 11 days.
These assaults caused colossal damage in Ein Rummaneh and Furn
el-Shubbak because tanks pounded every building that their crewmen
suspected of harboring militiamen.
   ``Tell the general he will have to roll his tanks over our dead
bodies before he can get into Ein Rummaneh,'' one Lebanese Forces
official said.
   Militiamen driving a reporter through the area kept the windows
rolled down but swerved and zigzagged like madmen ``because Aoun's
men are lurking there, only a few meters away.''
   The two areas look as if a hurricane raged through their streets.
   Nearly every boutique has been gutted. Clothes lie in shreds on
pockmarked streets covered with soot, debris and metal bars.
   The facades of apartment buildings are marred with gaping holes
ringed with black soot. They line narrow, nearly deserted alleys
filled with bullet-riddled cars.
   Dejected civilians in Ein Rummaneh's Ghannoum Street, a
confrontation line with Aoun's troops, were mopping up water that
flooded their 12-square-yard shelter when a shell burst the water
tanks.
   ``We had to sleep on soggy mattresses and the already-cold
shelter grew colder,'' Francis Yahshoushi said.
   ``We didn't have any water left except in a few cannisters. For
drinking water we boiled the water we had stored on kerosene
stoves. We nearly choked on the kerosene fumes,'' he added.
   A day after the loss of the precious water, Yahshoushi said, a
shell hit the first floor of the building, causing a fire that
spread to the entrance of the building.
   ``Had it not been for the rain, all 57 of us would have
suffocated,'' he said. ``We placed pieces of cloth soaked with
water on the faces of the children.''

   A moderately strong earthquake hit coastal China
north of Shanghai early today, but there were no immediate reports
of damage or injuries, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The quake, measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, was centered east
of Changshu City in Jiangsu province, about 56 miles northwest of
Shanghai.
   It was felt in Shanghai, the provincial capital of Nanjing and
the cities of Wuxi and Nantong.
   China is one of the world's most quake-prone lands. Among recent
tremors, three were killed in November when the southwest province
of Sichuan was hit by quakes measuring up to 5.4 on the Richter
scale, and at least 29 died in a series of heavy tremors
registering up to 6.1 in northern China's Shanxi province in
October.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
measuring 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated area. One
measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Low Gray Whale Numbers Puzzle Authorities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican authorities say they are trying to
figure out why fewer gray whales than usual are showing up in Baja
California waters to give birth this year.
   ``It will have to be researched,'' said Graciela de la Garza,
head of conservation for the Department of Ecology and Urban
Development.
   Marine mammal experts said 2,000 whales could be expected to
enter the lagoons during a normal calving season, but Mexican
authorities interviewed Thursday and Friday said only 12 to 20
whales have been spotted.
   A U.S. group said Friday that 40 to 60 whales were spotted in
recent days at San Ignacio, one of four bays the whales use for
breeding.
   De la Garza said it was the first time such low numbers had been
observed so late in the season.
   However, Anelio Aguayo, a marine mammal expert at the National
University in Mexico City, cautioned that there are frequently
``transitory'' variations in the numbers of whales in the different
lagoons.
   ``We need to wait for the end of the season and then see what
the outcome is,'' he said.
   The whales use the Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, a 6-million-acre
protected zone, because high salt content helps pregnant females
float and give birth, said Jorge Hernandez, a marine biologist for
a committee that oversees the reserve.
   They calve in the bays of San Ignacio, Guerrero Negro, Magdalena
and Ojo de Liebre, or Eye of the Hare, known to whale fans in the
United States as Scammon's Lagoon.
   The whales usually begin arriving in the first week of November.
By April, most have left for Alaskan waters, Hernandez said.
   But the few that arrived this year didn't start appearing until
mid-December, said Ulises Cesena Montano, the reserve's interagency
coordinator.
   ``We don't know the reasons. There are only hypotheses,'' he
said.
   The Group of 100, an ecological group of Mexican artists and
intellectuals, has suggested that an industrial salt plant in the
reserve's buffer zone may be damaging water quality or that the
whales may have been affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
Alaskan waters last year.
   But de la Garza and Cesena discounted those ideas.
   Cesena said the prevailing theory is that an unusual cold
current is keeping the whales away from their accustomed warm-water
haunts. In places the current is less than a mile from land, he
said.
   The temperature, strength and exact route of the current, dubbed
the Corriente de la Nina, are still being studied, and an aerial
search is being conducted for whales in the Pacific, Hernandez said.
   ``Once the cold water is past, maybe the whales will appear,''
Cesena said. He said only 20 whales have been spotted so far; de la
Garza said the number could be as low as 12.
   But Mark Palmer, conservation director of Ocean Alliance, based
in Oakland, Calif., said in a telephone interview that a group of
whalewatchers sponsored by Oceanic Society Expeditions has observed
40 to 60 gray whales in the San Ignacio lagoon in recent days.
   De la Garza said the variations are not necessarily cause for
alarm. ``There can be delays in any species' migration,'' she said.
   The species was hunted to the verge of extinction, but recovered
substantially after hunting was prohibited following World War I.
Palmer said the gray whale population is estimated at 17,000 to
20,000 from studies conducted over several years.
   He said the varying figures suggest a need for a better survey.
   ``In one part of the lagoons they probably don't have a good
overall picture,'' Palmer said.

   Since 1956, the government has
charged Helen Joseph with treason, detained her repeatedly, placed
her under house arrest and made it a crime to quote her.
   But the 84-year-old white anti-apartheid activist survived 34
years of bannings and on Feb. 2 became one of nearly 500 people,
living and dead, whose restrictions were lifted by President F.W.
de Klerk.
   ``I didn't think I'd see this day,'' Mrs. Joseph said, adding
that she was a bit disappointed the government no longer considered
her a threat. ``I'm a stubborn old bag and I wasn't expecting
things to change.''
   Police restrictions have been a way of life for many
anti-apartheid activists. Hundreds detained without charge during
the 3{-year-old state of emergency were released but then placed
under virtual house arrest.
   The restrictions varied, but often prohibited the activists from
leaving their neighborhoods, required them to be home each night,
prevented them from attending meetings or participating in
politics, and often made it impossible to hold a job.
   Zwelakhe Sisulu, son of recently released African National
Congress leader Walter Sisulu, was freed from prison in December
1988 after two years in detention. But he had to report daily to
police and was unable to resume his job as editor of the New Nation
newspaper until de Klerk rescinded his restriction order.
   Few have endured as much as Mrs. Joseph, a former social worker
and union official now confined to a wheelchair much of the time.
   The government charged Mrs. Joseph, ANC leader Nelson Mandela
and more than 150 others with treason in 1956 for their
anti-apartheid activities. All were acquitted in a trial that
lasted until 1961.
   However, Mrs. Joseph, a divorcee with no children, remained
under a banning order and in 1962 became the first South African
placed under house arrest. For the next nine years, police were the
only visitors allowed to enter her comfortable white house with a
red roof and a flower-filled garden in a Johannesburg suburb.
   Her house arrest ended in 1971 while she was undergoing a cancer
operation, but until Feb. 2 she remained a ``listed'' person,
meaning she could not be quoted in South Africa.
   She has been arrested numerous times, most recently in 1983 when
she sang a freedom song and gave a clenched-fist, black power
salute while attending a treason trial.
   As part of his reform program, de Klerk lifted the police orders
on 374 people who had been restricted after their release from
detention. He also removed the names of all 110 people who had been
``listed'' and could not be quoted. Many of the listed people are
either dead or have left South Africa. They include:
   _Most of the African National Congress leadership, such as
President Oliver Tambo, who is recovering from a stroke in Sweden.
   _Donald Woods, whose book ``Biko,'' about the life and death of
black activist Steve Biko was made into a movie ``Cry Freedom''
three years ago. Woods now lives in London.
   _Numerous whites, including Anne Heymann, who died of pneumonia
Feb. 3 at the age of 66, and her husband, Isaac Heymann, who died
of cancer four days later at the age of 79.
   The Heymanns, both listed since the 1960s, lived only a few
blocks from Mrs. Joseph and often visited her at her front gate
during the years when she wasn't allowed guests inside her home.
   ``So many people suffered for so many years,'' Mrs. Joseph said.
``I'm not grateful (for the lifting of the restrictions). It was
not an act of compassion. It never should have been done in the
first place.''
   Despite failing health, she occasionally travels to
anti-government protests, such as an ANC rally last October in the
township of Soweto, where she received a rousing cheer from the
mostly black crowd of 70,000.
   Mrs. Joseph, whose requests to visit Mandela were repeatedly
denied, finally was granted permission and the two met last Dec. 21
for the first time in 28 years.
   ``He looked different after so many years, but then so did I,''
Mrs. Joseph said. ``He was in very good form, full of jokes, full
of laughter.''
   Four days later, Mrs. Joseph had Christmas dinner with Walter
Sisulu and dozens of other activists at the home of a friend.
   After her house arrest was lifted, she began a tradition of
making a toast at noon on Christmas to remember all the
anti-apartheid activists who were in exile, in prison or had died.
   Word of the tradition had spread to exiles and prisoners, and
Sisulu told Mrs. Joseph it was observed during his years in jail.
   She hopes one day all the activists will be able to hold a
Christmas toast together in South Africa, but she doubts she'll be
around to take part.
   ``I don't think I'll see the end of apartheid, but I'll see it
diminish,'' she said. ``You can't wash away 300 years of cruelty
and injustice overnight.''

   Norvell Smith is a 14-year-old freedom fighter in
her own neighborhood. Approached by tough gang recuiters at age 12,
she decided to resist _ a decision that has won her top honors at
school.
   Norvell travels mean streets to and from John Hope Community
Academy, streets where wearing the wrong color, or just walking
home, can be a fatal mistake.
   In January, a 13-year-old classmate was killed in after-school
crossfire between rival gangs, the second student slain while going
to or from the public junior high school in the past six years.
   ``I lived in a gang environment all my life,'' Norvell, the
youngest of seven children raised by a single mother, said Friday.
``My momma told us to stay away from all those bad ideas and get an
education _ and that's what we're doing.''
   Last week the school, with the help of a drug- and
gang-prevention program called Project Serve, held a ``Drug and
Gang Awareness Super Bowl'' to honor students who are working to
end the violence.
   And seventh-grader Norvell was the show-stopper at an assembly
of the school's 950 students.
   ``You could hear almost a pin drop _ that's how good it was,''
eighth-grade teacher Jacqueline Cooney said of the girl's
award-winning speech.
   In the speech, Norvell told her classmates: ``I'm sick and tired
of these people coming into our neighborhoods, frightening our
friends and families and putting ideas into our little brothers'
and sisters' minds that gangs are cool.
   ``I say, the only thing that you can get out of being in a gang
is a hole in your head or 6 feet under _ take your choice.''
   John Hope Community Academy, in the city's South Side Englewood
neighborhood, straddles an invisible line dividing the turf of two
gangs.
   The rules for survival along that boundary are sometimes
deceptively simple, students say.
   ``You don't go to that side of the boulevard, and if you do, you
can't wear blue and black _ you have to wear red and black and wear
caps to the left,'' explains 12-year-old Kinisha Gaston.
   Assistant Principal Jim Murray acknowledged that when students
leave school property, they face harassment by gang recruiters _
often high school students.
   But Murray said the school is making some inroads with the help
of programs like Project Serve, in which off-duty law-enforcement
officials work to educate students about the dangers of drugs and
gangs.
   ``Our students _ the vast majority of them _ do not get involved
in the gang community,'' he said. ``The children tune in to what is
being said and they respond positively.''
   Norvell said Friday that students who join gangs do so ``because
they have low self esteem (and) want to belong.''
   She said she was approached two years ago, on a day when she
missed her bus, by a group of threatening girl recruiters.
   ``I didn't want to be in a gang,'' Norvell said. ``I was
thinking, `If I do this, I'm going to be ruined for life _ I'll
miss out on everything.'''
   She told the girls she wouldn't join the gang, a vow she has
repeated many times since.
   Since winning the ``Super Bowl'' this week, she said several
gang members have told her they are thinking about her speech.
   Most students, Norvell said simply, ``don't want to join a gang
and go to an early grave.''

   Since their Communist governments started
crumbling, Eastern European filmmakers have found it harder to come
up with story ideas. They don't have their leaders to kick around
anymore, say filmmakers and distributors at the Miami Film Festival.
   ``Every good film in Eastern Europe was an anti-Communist
idea,'' said Adrian Sarbu, chief of the Bureau of Cinema and
Television for Romania's governing National Salvation Front. ``We
have good filmmakers ... now we have to find the ideas.''
   The fall of the Berlin Wall and the revolutions against
hard-line Communism throughout the region have resulted in a vacuum
for ideas, said Sarbu, who is attending the film festival, which
opened Feb. 2 and ends Sunday.
   ``Before, we were kicking the Communists because it was popular.
Now who are you going to kick?'' asked John Gluski of the American
Institute of Polish Culture in Miami and a distributor of Polish
films.
   ``Before, they didn't have good scripts because of censorship.
Now there is no censorship and there are no scripts,'' Gluski, a
native of Poland, said Thursday.
   The Soviet Union has been an exception, said Andrel Zinca, a
native of Romania now with David Productions in Miami.
   After perestroika and glasnost _ Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policies of restructuring and openness _ Soviet
filmmakers produced some of the best films coming out of Europe,
Zinca said.
   This year's Polish feature film at the Miami festival has a
familiar anti-government theme, but it was completed prior to
Solidarity's strong showing during free elections in June that
forced the Communists out of power.
   ``The Last Ferry,'' set in the year 1981, is about a Solidarity
activist carrying important documents to the West aboard a ship.
When martial law is declared by the Communists, the ferry heads
back to Poland, but the passengers jump overboard. The film won the
grand prize at the National Film Festival in Gdansk, Poland.
   Another East bloc film at Miami's festival was ``The Rise and
Fall of the Ceausescu Dynasty,'' Romania's first and only film
released since the fall of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's regime in
December.
   The film graphically depicts the violence from the popular and
military overthrow. With the trial and execution of Ceausescu and
his wife, the film nears its end with, ``These animals are, no
longer.''
   The irony is that Romania's first film since the revolution
features the person Romanians would least like to see, Sarbu said.
Romanians were exposed almost exclusively to Ceausescu and his
propaganda for about two hours a day on their nation's only
television station for the last seven years.
   Sarbu said the films censored by Ceausescu will eventually be
released. He expects new films to follow one theme: ``We have to do
politics in all of Eastern Europe.''
   That will require artist in the East bloc to restructure their
language, phraseology and thinking, he said. ``We must reinvent the
language in all forms of art,'' Sarbu said Thursday.
   East bloc countries are not only short of ideas, but also money.
   Polish filmmakers can no longer rely on government subsidies,
Gluski said. Like other East bloc counties, financing will have to
come from their fledgling free markets.
   ``There is no money. You have to look for private financing,''
Gluski said.
   Gluski said a $5 million U.S.-produced film would cost $500,000
in Poland simply because of cheaper labor and other costs.
   ``There are people with talent. They have equipment. They have
the artists. But they need the financial help to produce it,''
Gluski said.

<HEAD>Singer-Songwriter Del Shannon an Apparent Suicide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Del Shannon, who wrote and sang
anguished rock songs in the 1960s, including the hits ``Runaway''
and ``Keep Searchin','' died from an apparent self-inflicted
gunshot wound. He was 55.
   Shannon's wife, ``Bonnie'' LeAnne, found her husband's body
Thursday night in the den of their home 35 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom said Friday.
   Hom said the death was being investigated as a possible suicide.
   Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said an
autopsy would be performed over the weekend. He said Shannon died
from a .22-caliber bullet wound in the head.
   ``It had to be impulsive,'' said his lifelong friend and
personal manager Dan Bourgoise. ``In the end, he must have felt
alone. All the paranoid things that made him write those songs he
wrote, like `Runaway,' _ I think he just ended up being that lonely
guy.''
   He said Shannon was nearing completion on a new album with Tom
Petty's group, the Heartbreakers.
   ``I'm very saddened to have lost a friend,'' Petty said in a
statement. ``Del was one of the true greats.''
   Bourgoise said Shannon had been depressed recently.
   ``He was disoriented and he was sick and he started to do all
kinds of worse-case scenarios in his head,'' Bourgoise said.
   ``He was lonelier than he should have been, with all the friends
around him,'' Bourgoise said. He said his friend had fought drugs,
depression and alcoholism as his career faltered, but had been
sober since 1976.
   Singer Bobby Vee said he talked with Shannon last weekend before
the two performed in Fargo, N.D., at an annual Buddy Holly memorial
concert.
   Vee also said Shannon was despondent about going on a British
tour and his recent move into a new house. ``I didn't realize the
extent of his pain,'' Vee said.
   It had been years since Shannon, who was born Charles Westover
in Coopersville, Mich., on Dec. 30, 1934, had a hit song or whirled
around in the popularity frenzy that surrounded him in the 1960s.
   In Petty's recent hit ``Runnin' Down A Dream,'' he writes about
listening to the radio while on a drive: ``Me and Del were singin'
little `Runaway.' I was flyin'.''
   In the movie ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Tom Cruise's
character sings a bit of ``Runaway'' along with Shannon's recording
in a bar.
   Shannon learned to play guitar at 13, entertained in high school
and, after a two-year stint in the Army, began playing clubs in his
home state of Michigan. An Ann Arbor disc jockey who heard him set
up an audition and Shannon flew to New York to record ``Runaway''
for Big Top records.
   It was his strong falsetto choruses on his hits, including
``Hats Off To Larry,'' that became Shannon's trademark during the
height of his career.
   With the late Roy Orbison, Shannon set a groove for American
rock in the early 1960s with country-influenced pop ballads, and
like Orbison he was swept aside by the British music invasion.
   Ironically, it was the British who most admired the talent of
Shannon, who had an appearance with the Beatles at the Royal Albert
Hall and was voted by several polls as the most popular male singer
in Britain in 1962 and 1963.
   His other Top 20 singles included ``Hats Off to Larry,''
``Little Town Flirt'' and ``Keep Searchin'.''
   Shannon and his wife of 27 years, Shirley, divorced and he
married the former ``Bonnie'' LeAnne Gutierrez in 1987. He leaves
three grown children by his first wife _ son Craig and daughters
Kym and Jody, Bourgoise said.

<HEAD>Board Plans 10 Most Wanted Safety Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board plans
to produce its own ``10 most wanted'' recommendations in an effort
to get government and industry to take more actions to protect
travelers.
   The list will include the top proposals of the board for saving
lives in air, land and sea transportation, newly confirmed board
Chairman James L. Kolstad said Friday. He said too many board
recommendations are ignored.
   Kolstad, in an interview, acknowledged the five-member board's
image has been ``somewhat tarnished'' in recent years and promised
a firm but non-confrontational approach to public safety.
   The NTSB, which investigates all plane crashes and other major
transportation accidents but cannot enforce its recommendations,
has been plagued by a lack of trained investigators, a tight
budget, low staff morale and bickering over leadership.
   Kolstad's confirmation by the Senate late Thursday ended 17
months of uncertainty for the board.
   Kolstad, who has been acting board chairman since August 1988
while he and former chairman Jim Burnett vied for the permanent
post, said he expects his confirmation to end friction on the board.
   The chairman said he would work to improve the timeliness,
quality and efficiency of board efforts to ensure safety of the
nation's transportation systems, focusing much of its efforts on
what he said are the nation's most pressing safety problems.
   ``Instead of shoveling out hundreds of recommendations a year
and treating all of them the same, at least we would have 10 that
Congress, the public and industry know are the ones the NTSB feels
are the most important,'' he said.
   Kolstad finally moved into Burnett's office this week, while
Burnett remains on the five-seat board. The Senate also confirmed
former Federal Railroad Administration deputy Susan Coughlin as the
newest board member, replacing Lee Dickinson. One seat, which
belonged to the late Joseph T. Nall, awaits a presidential
nomination. The other board member is John Lauber.
   The board has not added a new staff position in 4{ years.
President Bush's requested $30.9 million budget for fiscal 1991
would add 22 posts, but the independent agency now has fewer
employees than it had in the late 1970s when there were fewer
accidents.
   Still, transportation safety has improved over the years,
Kolstad said, and there are more accidents now because people are
traveling more.
   He defended his leadership style, which has been contrasted with
that of the tough-talking Burnett, who failed to win Senate
approval when former President Reagan nominated him for a fourth
term as chairman.
   ``My style is to ensure that both the government and the
industry understand the reason for our recommendations. ... I've
never felt that it's effective to do this through a confrontational
style,'' Kolstad said.
   ``I want to see our recommendations become more realistic, and I
think we can do that with a two-way communication with all segments
of the transportation industry,'' he said.
   But Kolstad said he would criticize the Federal Aviation
Administration or other agencies if necessary and would continue to
send teams to investigate any safety lapses.
   ``We're still going to continue to have a firm oversight and
we're going to call the shots as we see them,'' he said, adding,
``Watch what we do more than what I say.''

   The resignation of a key official in President
Bush's beleaguered savings and loan bureaucracy is worsening fears
the government may be botching the selling of failed thrifts and
their repossessed real estate.
   Daniel P. Kearney, chief staff officer of the Resolution Trust
Corp. Oversight Board, quit Friday after complaining the board
wasn't giving him the authority he needed to do his job.
   The resignation is ``more evidence of the growing disarray in
the Bush administration,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Banking Committee. He predicted delay in
dealing with failed S&amp;Ls would increase the taxpayer cost of the
bailout.
   Economist Paul Getman of Regional Financial Associates, a
consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said bureaucratic infighting
is also heightening concern that an overhang of government-owned
real estate will depress property prices in some areas.
   ``It means that if they're not selling much (real estate) now,
when they finally get around to selling, the glut may be worse than
people feared,'' he said.
   The board said late Friday that it was naming William Taylor to
replace Kearney on an acting basis. The brief statement gave no
reason for Kearney's departure, saying only that Taylor, who is
head of the Federal Reserve Board's banking regulation division,
would take over immediately at the RTC.
   The oversight board, created to set policy for government thrift
rescues, is composed of three officials: Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady, who serves as chairman; Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan; and Jack Kemp, secretary of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development.
   The board has a small staff under Kearney. However, the work of
the bailout is performed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an
independent regulatory agency.
   ``What's happened, in a nutshell, is that Congress has set up an
organization with responsibilities, overnight, far larger than
Citicorp,'' the nation's largest bank, said Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa,
the senior Republican on the banking committee.
   Recent congressional hearings have focused on the tension
between the oversight board and the FDIC, but Kearney's resignation
underscores reported infighting between the Treasury Department and
the oversight board staff,
   ``It's an awkward structure. ... On top of that, Treasury has
played a particularly assertive role of the three institutions
represented on the board,'' Leach said.
   Kearney did not directly respond to those reports in his
statement, but said his job ``does not currently afford me the
authority that I believe is essential to be effective.''
   The resignation likely will add momentum to a proposal by Rep.
Bruce Vento, D-Minn., to disband the oversight board.
   ``Kearney .... faced bureaucratic hurdles that no one could
overcome,'' said Vento, who heads a House task force monitoring the
bailout. ``His resignation only serves to confirm (that) ... the
oversight board should be abolished.''
   Kearney, who served at HUD and the Office of Management and
Budget during the Ford and Nixon administrations, was hired as
oversight board president in October. His last job was pension fund
adviser for Aldrich, Eastman &amp; Waltch Inc. in Boston.
   Art Siddon, a Treasury spokesman, had no immediate comment on
the resignation.
   ``The RTC has accomplished nothing, and has cost taxpayers
millions of dollars. Perhaps that is why Mr. Kearney quit,'' said
Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill. ``The taxpayers would like to quit
also, but unfortunately, that is not possible.''

   A leader of Angola's anti-communist rebels
says the U.S. is assuring his forces will get continued American
diplomatic and material support.
   Jeremias Chitunda, vice president of the UNITA rebels, met with
Under Secretary of State Robert Kimmitt on Friday as the group is
facing perhaps its severest battlefield test in 15 years of
fighting.
   The U.S.-backed UNITA has been battling a government offensive
in an area of southeast Angola that has been in rebel hands for
years. Most of the fighting has been centered on the town of
Mavinga.
   ``We appreciate very much the sensitivity, the understanding
that is manifest here towards the urgency and the seriousness of
the intensity of the offensive,'' Chitunda said in an interview.
   He was not specific about the nature of the assistance he was
promised. The State Department had no immediate comment on the
meeting.
   On Tuesday, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos claimed
victory in the battle for Mavinga but Chitunda said that statement
was not true.
   U.S. officials have said that government forces control the
airport but that most of the surrounding area continues to be held
by UNITA.
   Angola is one conflict that has not been affected by the recent
improvement in relations between the United States and the Soviet
Union. Kremlin military aid is believed to be in the range of $600
million to $800 million, according to officials, and U.S. arms aid
to UNITA totals about $50 million.
   Thirteen senators sent a message to Secretary of State James A.
Baker III in Moscow earlier this week demanding he ``object
strongly'' to the Soviet role in the seven-week-old military
offensive.
   Chitunda said he was told the Bush administration would make a
serious effort to promote a cease-fire in Angola and to get peace
talks under way.
   He said Cuban forces have become more involved than before in
the offensive by assisting in the delivery of supplies to
government combatants.
   The battle for Mavinga is the first major conventional military
confrontation since South Africa agreed in December 1988 to halt
support for UNITA and Cuba began a withdrawal of its troops backing
government forces.
   UNITA wants a settlement based on direct negotiations leading to
national elections. The government proposed an amnesty for the
UNITA forces that would lead to their reintegration into Angolan
society.

   Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola was ordered to
pay $4.8 million in interest on a long-disputed debt to a
financier, bringing his costs in the case to nearly $8 million.
   Coppola, the maker of ``The Cotton Club,'' ``Apocalypse Now''
and other films already is in bankruptcy proceedings he said were
brought on by the debt dispute.
   Coppola was in Rome directing the third in his ``Godfather''
series about the Corleone crime family, and a spokesman here
declined to comment.
   The dispute involves Jack Singer, a Canadian real estate
developer who came to Coppola's rescue with a $3 million loan to
help him complete ``One From the Heart,'' an expensive flop, in
1981.
   Robert Chapman, a lawyer for Singer who won the $4.8 million
interest judgment in Superior Court Wednesday, said he also expects
to ask for attorney's fees.

   Susan Eisenhower, a granddaughter of the late
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, married a Soviet space scientist
and political reformer in a ceremony at the U.S. ambassador's
residence.
   Tass, the only news agency admitted to the ceremony Friday,
described it as a ``sensation.''
   The bride, 38, wed Roald Sagdeev, 57, former head of the Space
Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Sagdeev is a
member of the Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet parliament,
and was an associate of Soviet human rights champion Andrei D.
Sakharov.
   Sakharov's widow, Elena Bonner, attended the wedding, others who
were present said.
   Eisenhower and Sagdeev met at a conference in the United States
in 1987.
   The bride, who has her own consulting company, was married twice
before and has three school-age children. Sagdeev has two grown
children.

   Former tennis pro Chris Evert, accepting an
award in a White House ceremony, said she wants President Bush to
stress physical education in schools.
   Bush on Friday awarded the Flo Hyman Award for excellence in
sports to Evert on behalf of the Women and Girls in Sports
Foundation. The award is given in memory of the Olympic volleyball
star who died suddenly in 1986.
   Bush said the winner of 18 Grand Slam tournaments had
``represented not just the game of tennis, but your country. And
you've done it so very well and with grace, dignity and good
sportsmanship.''
   Evert said she wanted to stress the importance of physical
education in schools and sought the president's help in pushing
that point as part of his education package.

   The drunken-driving case against former
fashion model Hazel Diane Moore, who helped the FBI arrest
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, has been continued as lawyers try to
make a deal.
   Ms. Moore, 38, also known as Rasheeda Moore, was to be arraigned
March 2 in Van Nuys Municipal Court, under an order issued Friday
by court Commissioner Mitchell Block.
   Ms. Moore, who did not appear in court, was arrested Jan. 1 for
investigation of driving under the influence. Her blood alcohol
level was 0.12 percent, over the legal limit of 0.08 percent,
police said.
   Ms. Moore, a friend of Barry's, worked as an undercover
informant for the FBI, calling Barry to a Washington hotel room
where he was arrested Jan. 18 on cocaine charges.
   Ms. Moore's attorney, Ronald J. Lewis, said she probably will
plead no contest at her arraignment, depending on the outcome of
discussions with the city attorney's office.

   Two weeks ago Arnold Kephart was an Army
deserter earning a meager living as a truck driver in East Germany.
Now, his attorney says, he is under siege _ and camera lights _ in
his own country.
   Reporters, talk-show producers, and movie-production companies
want the life story of the man arrested here on a 30-year-old
warrant for desertion after crashing a military truck, said James
Martin Davis, Kephart's attorney.
   Kephart was arrested after returning here Jan. 30 with his East
German-born, 12-year-old son, Frankie. He was held by the Army for
a week, given a less-than-honorable discharge and released to a
long-awaited reunion with relatives.
   Kephart's return to Omaha was on all three television network
morning shows the day after his release. A London newspaper and a
West German news magazine paid for interviews at undisclosed prices.
   Davis also heard from four production companies about movie
deals.
   Kephart is taking all of the attention in stride, said Davis.
   ``He's just so happy to be back in the U.S.,'' Davis said.
``He's more impressed with popcorn than he is the newspapers.''

   Ervin S. Duggan will fill the final vacant
seat at the Federal Communications Commission, marking the first
time in nearly three years that the agency has been at full
strength.
   Duggan, 50, will be sworn in to the Democratic seat vacated last
year by Patricia Diaz Dennis. His five-year term, which will be
retroactive to last July, will expire in June 1994.
   Duggan, a Washington communications consultant and former
speechwriter for President Lyndon Johnson, was confirmed by the
Senate on a voice vote late Thursday.
   FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said Duggan expects to resume
his new office in early March. That will bring the commission up to
full strength, five members, for the first time since April 1987.
   Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., had
held up nominations to the commission during ideological
tugs-of-war with two Reagan-era FCC chairmen, Dennis Patrick and
Mark Fowler.
   Duggan described himself during the confirmation process as a
``family values candidate.'' Initial fears apparently waned that
Duggan, who is national chairman of Presbyterians for Democracy and
Religious Freedom, would be a tool of religious fundamentalists at
the commission.
   Duggan told the Commerce Committee he was not a believer in
``heavy-handed regulation.''
   ``I am well aware of the virtue of the free market and of robust
competition,'' he said. ``But I do believe that government has a
legitimate role to play in defense of the public's interest.''

<HEAD>73 Senators Oppose Cuts in Aid to Israel, Egypt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy-three senators say they will oppose
any cuts in aid for Israel and Egypt, the largest recipients of
U.S. assistance.
   ``In the Middle East, we should reaffirm the support of the
United States for upholding our foreign assistance commitments to
Israel and Egypt,'' the senators said in a letter organized by
Sens. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   The senators' letter, delivered to the White House on Wednesday
but not publicly released until Friday, was written in reaction to
proposals _ first advanced by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan. _ to trim aid to Israel, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines and
Pakistan. Those countries received about 80 percent of the total
U.S. foreign aid budget.
   Dole said reducing money for the five countries by 5 percent
would generate more money for other countries, namely those in
Eastern Europe.
   The underlying proposal to redistribute aid has been supported
by Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the
appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations.
   Bush administration officials have called for more flexibility
in dividing up the foreign-aid pie.
   The Bush budget for fiscal 1991 totals about $14 billion.
Traditionally, Israel receives about $3 billion annually from the
United States, with Egypt receiving about $2.3 billion.
   The 73 senators said they want to see the United States
``reinforce the democratic trends in the nations of Eastern
Europe.''
   ``Budgetary realities force us to make difficult choices, but
retrenching on our commitment to assistance to Israel and Egypt
would not be a wise choice,'' they wrote.

   The Galileo spaceship swooped past Venus
early Saturday, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its 1995 rendezvous with
Jupiter.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio
signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest
approach to Venus at 12:59 a.m. EST, cruising 10,028 miles above
the planet's hellishly hot surface.
   ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to
Venus,'' said Bill O'Neil, science and mission design manager.
``The greatest challenge of getting Galileo to Jupiter has been
met.''
   Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on
Earth confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered Galileo's infrared
light sensor to start observing Venus. The instrument was looking
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds
overhead, O'Neil said.
   That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and
measurements, including a photographic search for lightning.
Earlier Friday, Galileo studied dust particles and magnetic fields
in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures.
   ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the
mission,'' said Galileo project scientist Torrence Johnson. ``After
the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to
Jupiter.''
   The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy
of its propellant supply, said mission director Neal Ausman.
   The $1.35 billion mission will let Galileo examine Earth, its
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into
an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995, they
arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.
   Galileo was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last Oct.
18.
   Venus circles the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mercury,
the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles
above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on Earth. Venus is about 95
percent as wide as Earth. Scientists suspect it may have active
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust.
   The Venus flyby was designed purely to give Galileo a boost for
its trip to Jupiter by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to
88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the
spacecraft will use the Earth as a slingshot next Dec. 8 and again
on Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward Jupiter,
Ausman said.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by
having Galileo's camera and instruments make photographs and
measurements of Venus starting Thursday night and continuing for a
week.
   But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of
Galileo's four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to Earth
until October, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the
material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used
only for communications to keep Galileo operating.
   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first
flight past Earth.
   Galileo was programmed to photograph Venus and study the planet
with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look
for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere,
examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer
at the lower atmosphere.
   Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with Venus'
atmosphere. At the same time, NASA arranged for the Pioneer Venus
Orbiter, circling Venus since 1978, to make similar measurements
closer to the planet, Johnson said.
   While nearly 20 other U.S. and Soviet spacecraft have visited
Venus, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he
said.
   But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet
success next week when they try to have Galileo send back a small
amount of data, Johnson added.
   Studies from Earth and previous spacecraft indicate Venus has
continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing Mount Everest and
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains.
   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,
will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar to
peer through the clouds and map at least 70 percent of Venus'
surface during a $550 million mission.
   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and
study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration originally
planned to send Galileo on a two-year trip to Jupiter by launching
it with a Centaur rocket after it was released from a shuttle.
   But the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed
seven crew members raised safety concerns. NASA decided against
using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.
   So Galileo was launched with a much weaker Inertial Upper Stage
booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket
required NASA to redesign Galileo's route so the craft could
utilize gravity from Venus and Earth for a much longer, looping
trip to Jupiter.
   Environmentalists failed in court to stop NASA from having a
shuttle carry Galileo into space. They feared a Challenger-like
explosion could contaminate Florida with plutonium in Galileo's
nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity
using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. NASA said the
risk was minimal.
   Galileo is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who
discovered Jupiter's major moons.

   Lawmakers are complaining they are having a
hard time explaining to constituents why deeper cuts can't be made
in U.S. troop strength in Europe.
   ``The logic of all this is getting very hard to explain to
taxpayers,'' Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., told William H. Taft IV,
U.S. ambassador to NATO, on Friday.
   President Bush's proposed 1991 ``defense budget does not
recognize anything that has happened in the world in the past six
months,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. ``We must be creative and
responsive, and I don't think at this point we are either.''
   Taft told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that American
forces in Europe's central zone will not be reduced below 195,000,
even if the Soviets pull back every soldier they have in the region.
   Even without a direct and immediate Soviet threat, he said, U.S.
troops are needed as a visible sign of continued American
commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European
security.
   ``We have to have visible soldiers walking around?'' Pressler
asked. ``That's going to be hard for me to sell in South Dakota.''
   Pressler, echoing concerns of committee colleagues, said
prosperous U.S. allies such as France and West Germany should
shoulder a larger share of the defense burden, and the United
States should be able to reap some defense savings because of
Moscow's rapidly shrinking sphere of influence.
   Taft said it was clear that the threat to Western Europe has
greatly diminished, both because of the changes in Eastern Europe
and because of the new treaty limiting intermediate-range nuclear
forces.
   But Taft said the 195,000-troop figure Bush proposed in his
State of the Union speech last month is a rock-bottom number
because it ``looks right to the president's military advisers.''
   ``For the foreseeable future, NATO's strategy of deterrence for
the prevention of war, based upon both nuclear and conventional
forces, remains the best way to prevent war and protect our
freedom,'' Taft said.

<HEAD>United Germany Could Stay With NATO, But Special Status for East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A united Germany could stay with the
NATO alliance and still carve out a special military status for the
present territory of East Germany, alliance officials and analysts
say.
   The overriding concern for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization is that a reunified Germany maintain its ties to the
West.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, a West German, says
there is ``no acceptable alternative to Germany remaining anchored
in the Atlantic alliance.''
   The New York Times today reported that U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III suggested a single Germany with less than full
membership in NATO might be acceptable.
   ``We favor a continued membership in, or association with,
NATO,'' the newspaper quoted Baker as saying in Moscow, where he
was meeting with Soviet officials. He did not elaborate.
   East German Premier Hans Modrow has suggested that a combined
nation be neutral. West Germany belongs to the 16-nation NATO, and
East Germany is one of the seven countries in the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact.
   But U.S. and NATO officials have dismissed the idea of such a
large neutral state in Europe.
   ``A drifting, neutral Germany cannot be a solution, given the
country's geostrategic position and its political, economic and
military potential,'' Woerner said in a recent speech in West
Germany.
   Woerner and President Bush will discuss the German question and
other NATO issues this weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West Germany's foreign minister, has
sketched out another plan for a successor nation. It would remain
part of NATO but only the territory of West Germany would be tied
to its military structure. NATO would not extend its forces farther
east.
   Baker has registered his support for Genscher's plan.
   A formula would have to be found for dealing with the large
contingents of forces stationed in both Germanys.
   About 380,000 Soviet troops are stationed in East Germany. More
than 200,000 American soldiers are based across the border in West
Germany. Belgium, Britain, France and the Netherlands have an
additional 100,000 or so troops there.
   Negotiators for NATO and the Warsaw Pact are bargaining in
Vienna to cut forces, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arms
in Europe. Bush recently suggested that Washington and Moscow set
equal ceilings of 225,000 troops in all of Europe, with 195,000
troops in Central Europe, which would include both Germanys.
   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed a limit
of 195,000 troops for both sides in all of Europe.
   Some have raised the possibility that to ease the Kremlin's
fears about a united Germany, Soviet troops could remain in place
in a ``Guantanamo'' fashion. That refers to the presence of U.S.
naval forces in Guantanamo Bay in Communist Cuba.
   There are precedents for what some call ``a la carte''
membership in NATO.
   Spain and France are members of NATO but keep their forces
outside the joint military structure. Spain also does not allow the
storing of nuclear weapons on its soil.
   Norway, which shares a border with the Soviet Union, is a member
of the integrated military structure but has set out certain
peacetime limitations.
   No foreign troops are stationed on its soil. No alliance forces
take part in military exercises in the extreme northern part of the
country. Nuclear weapons also cannot be warehoused on its territory.
   Indeed, West Germany itself offers a special case.
   The Bonn government joined the Western alliance in 1955,
becoming its 15th member.
   As part of membership, it had to put its military forces, except
for a defensive territorial army, under the alliance command. It is
the only country to have assigned to the joint structure in
peacetime.

   Vice President Luis Alberto Sanchez said the
government ``will not accept'' the interior minister's offer to
resign after police wounded a leftist presidential candidate during
a campaign march.
   The statement Sanchez made to reporters Friday night in Congress
was the first official word since Interior Minister Agustin
Mantilla offered his ``irrevocable'' resignation to President Alan
Garcia two days earlier.
   Marxist presidential candidate Henry Pease was slightly wounded
in the leg by birdshot fired Wednesday afternoon by police who also
used tear gas to break up a campaign march in downtown Lima near
the presidential palace.
   Mantilla called the police action ``without justification.''
   Also slightly wounded were two congressional candidates of
Pease's United Left coalition, two newspaper photographers and one
of Pease's bodyguards.
   One police commander was fired and another suspended following
the incident, and the Interior Ministry said it was launching an
investigation.
   Other candidates in the April 8 election are Alfonso Barrantes
of the Socialist Left coalition, Luis Alva Castro of the governing
center-left Aprista Party, and front-runner Mario Vargas Llosa of
the center-right Democratic Front coalition.
   By law, Garcia cannot run for re-election.

<HEAD>Administration Asks End of Duties on Some Caribbean, Central

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has asked Congress to
remove import duties on clothing, shoes and other labor-intensive
products from the Caribbean and Central America but says it opposes
any tampering with sugar quotas imposed on the region.
   Endorsing an extension and expansion of President Reagan's 1983
Caribbean Basin Initiative, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
said Friday that lifting the present duties would ``mitigate the
need for (foreign) aid and raise our own exports'' to the region.
   However, she said changing import quota formulas on sugar to
assure the Caribbean a stable U.S. market to the possible detriment
of other exporters, such as Australia and the Philippines, would
violate international trade agreements.
   When asked at a Senate hearing if she would recommend that
President Bush veto a bill that includes a guaranteed minimum for
sugar imports from the Caribbean, Mrs. Hills said she didn't know.
   Congress is expected this year to make permanent the current
program, now scheduled to expire in September 1995. But expanding
it to include duty-free status on a wide variety of goods that
compete with U.S. products is encountering widespread opposition.

<HEAD>Accountant Says Collapsed Thrift was `Giving Its Money Away'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association ``was
manufacturing profits by giving its money away,'' says an
accountant who examined Lincoln's books at the government's request.
   Roger Johnson testified Friday in U.S. District Court that the
collapsed thrift, owned by Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating and
seized by federal regulators last April, recorded $135 million in
pre-tax gains on 15 land transactions in 1986 and 1987.
   But in reality, there was ``a net outflow of cash from Lincoln''
in each instance, said Johnson, a certified public accountant for
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.
   The net cash expended by Lincoln to accomplish the sales totaled
$217 million, according to a draft of a report prepared last July
by Johnson's firm and introduced in court.
   Reading from the report, Johnson said the Irvine, Calif., thrift
was ``made to function as an engine designed to funnel insured
deposits'' to Keating's Phoenix holding company, the American
Continental Corp.
   The cash outflow is ``precisely the opposite of what you would
expect. ... The profits reported should have been reversed,''
Johnson told U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin.
   Lincoln is suing the government's Office of Thrift Supervision,
seeking a court order to remove the conservatorship and
receivership regulators imposed last year to seize control of the
thrift.
   American Continental Corp. benefited from the 15 transactions
under a tax-sharing agreement in which Lincoln made payments to its
parent.

<TEXT>
   A former Unisys Corp. official has been
sentenced to one year in prison for conspiring to make illegal
campaign donations and obstructing the FBI's investigation of
Pentagon procurement fraud.
   John B.G. Roberts III, a former marketing manager for the
defense contractor, was sentenced Friday on his guilty plea to
charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and charges of
obstruction of justice.
   Alexandria, Va., U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton also fined
Roberts $10,000 and ordered him to serve a two-year term of
supervised release after completing the prison term.
   Roberts could have received a 10-year prison term for his guilty
plea.
   He admitted that he arranged for the submission of false claims
to the Pentagon for consultants' services when the money was
actually funneled to members of Congress who had influence over
defense procurement.
   In pleading guilty Nov. 30, Roberts also admitted that he
arranged for the filing of false statements with the Federal
Election Commission to conceal illegal corporate donations to a
number of lawmakers.
   Roberts admitted that he suggested to defense consultants
working for Unisys how much money to donate to various lawmakers'
campaign funds and prepared figures for the company's annual budget.
   Several Unisys consultants have pleaded guilty in connection
with making illegal campaign contributions.
   Donations went to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; the late Rep.
Joseph D. Addabbo, D-N.Y., who chaired the House defense
appropriations subcommittee; Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.; Rep. Roy

<HEAD>Govt Asks Paris Club To Allow Moratorium On Debt Payments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has
asked 17 creditor nations if his non-Communist government could
halt payments on Poland's $40 billion foreign debt, officials said.
   Mazowiecki requested a suspension of payments because ``we are
at the moment introducing a very difficult economic reform
program,'' government spokesman Zbigniew Augustynowicz said in an
interview.
   Mazowiecki made the request Friday in a letter sent to fellow
government leaders in the Paris Club, which meets next week.
   The club, an informal grouping of representatives of Western
creditor nations that gathers occasionally in Paris, was expected
to take up Poland's debt problems Wednesday.
   About 65 percent, or $26 billion, of Poland's hard-currency debt
is owed to 17 governments in the Club.
   Poland, which has had a non-Communist government since last
summer, has been paying about $1.5 billion annually to service its
Western debt, the largest such obligation in Eastern Europe.
   Those payments _ while falling far short of Poland's obligations
_ consume nearly all of the country's net export earnings, leaving
Poland little money to invest in rebuilding its dilapidated economy.
   However, major debt rescheduling with the Paris Club was refused
until Poland's new Solidarity-led government and the International
Monetary Fund could reach agreement on a tough adjustment program
to reform Poland's economy. The plan took effect Jan. 1 and was
formally approved by the IMF executive board last week.
   According to Augustynowicz, the letter asks specifically that
the creditor governments:
   _ Permit Poland to suspend all Paris Club debt payments,
including interest and principal, for 1989 and 1990.
   _ Consider freezing the country's Western debt at its current
level of $40 billion. This would require the Paris Club governments
to exert pressure on their countries' commercial banks, which hold
most of the rest of the $40 billion debt.
   _ Seek a long-term solution to the Polish debt problem that
would go in the direction of outright debt reduction.
   The Paris Club had been expected to offer Poland a
``magnanimous'' restructuring of the debt, allowing it to stretch
out $5 billion in payments due the next two years over 10 years, a
U.S. finance official, David C. Mulford, said last month.
   Most of the debt was accumulated during the 1970s by the
Communist government under then-party leader Edward Gierek.
   In the 1970s, Communist authorities borrowed and spent Western
money freely on ill-conceived investment projects and on food and
consumer goods in an attempt to win public affection. Later
Communist governments acknowledged that the money was wasted.
   When Poland's economy slumped at the end of the 1970s and the
beginning of the 1980s, the country was no longer able to keep up
payments, and mounting interest doubled the debt to the $40 billion
level by this year.

   Missouri is the ``Show-Me State,'' New
York the ``Empire State.'' And now, under a state legislator's
proposal, the Land of Enchantment may become the ``Like-to-Work
State.''
   House Speaker Raymond Sanchez has proposed a $100,000
advertising campaign to promote what he called the state's
``relatively contented work force.''
   John Dendahl, secretary of the Department of Economic
Development and Tourism, agreed that New Mexico workers' low
absenteeism and turnover rates could attract new business to the
state.
   Dendahl said another attraction for companies is ``the fact that
employers don't have to pay (workers) as much'' as in other states.
   State Rep. Robert Light told Sanchez he likes ``Like-to-Work,''
but he suggested something stronger: ``Have you thought of
replacing the word `like' with `love?'''

   Twin robbery suspects held the Richland
County sheriff hostage in the county courthouse for four hours
Friday night before one of the twins killed his brother and
himself, authorities said.
   The sheriff was unharmed.
   Assistant County Prosecutor Jerry Ault said Brad Jordan killed
his twin brother, Chad, with a single shot to the head, then turned
the weapon on himself.
   The 18-year-old brothers had been brought from jail to the
sheriff's detective bureau in the courthouse for questioning about
a string of robberies they allegedly committed ten days before in
three northeastern Ohio towns.
   The twins overcame Deputy Deb Strine and took her gun, then held
her hostage until Sheriff Dale Shetler exchanged himself for
Strine, said sheriff's officer Gregory Kemp.
   Ms. Strine was released about 6:20 p.m. Shetler was in the room
when Jordan killed his brother and himself, Kemp said.
   The twins' mother, Sandra Teeters, and stepbrother, Kenneth
Teeters, were outside the courthouse during the standoff.
   The Jordans were arrested Jan. 31 after a clerk at a convenience
store in Belleville, just south of Mansville, triggered a silent
alarm during a robbery there.
   They also were charged with robberies the same day in Mansville
and Canton, 60 miles east of Mansville.

<HEAD>Pentagon Policy Shift Would End Basic Strategic Doctrine</HEAD>

   A Pentagon decision to shelve contingency
plans for fighting a war with the Soviet Union in Iran eliminates a
strategic doctrine that has guided U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf
for four decades.
   During that time, U.S. military planners have prepared for a
Soviet attack southward through Iran toward the gulf's vital oil
fields. The Americans would block it in the rugged Zagros mountain
range, which parallels much of Iran's gulf coastline.
   According to published accounts in Washington, the Pentagon's
Defense Planning Guidance report for 1992-97, just approved by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, declares that neither a Soviet
invasion of Iran nor the U.S. ability to counter it is now
considered ``credible.''
   According to reports, the Pentagon document directs military
planners to formulate a new strategy that assumes Soviet military
strength will be reduced through negotiations on conventional force
levels in Europe and that future threats to the gulf would
originate elsewhere.
   Although not named, potential adversaries evidently include
Iran, which is hostile to Saudi Arabia and still technically at war
with Iraq, despite their 1988 cease-fire. Iraq, stronger as a
result of its military triumph in the eight-year Gulf war, is also
mistrusted by some Arab states.
   The Zagros strategy, by some accounts, dates back to 1946, when
then-Soviet leader Josef Stalin, hoping to gain access to the
gulf's warm-water ports, tested his former World War II allies by
attempting to annex territory in northern Iran.
   The effort was thwarted by U.S. and British diplomacy at the
United Nations. American policy has recognized Moscow's interest in
obtaining access to the gulf and perhaps dominating the
oil-producing Arab states along its shores.
   From those days until now, according to foreign policy expert
Gary Sick, U.S. leaders have seen Iran as the most likely place
outside Europe where a U.S.-Soviet clash might escalate into
another world war.
   The United States had the advantage until its close ally, Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was overthrown in 1979. His Islamic
fundamentalist successor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, rejected
ties with both Washington and Moscow, making Iran a hostile setting
for both superpowers in the event of a showdown.
   The U.S. doctrine of blocking Soviet moves through Iran acquired
new importance after Moscow invaded neighboring Afghanistan in 1979
and deployed warships near the gulf.
   Although undoubtedly influenced by the easing of East-West
tensions, the shift toward a new Pentagon strategy for the gulf
reflects thinking that predates the Soviet bloc upheavals by at
least a year, U.S. sources say.
   As early as 1988, these sources have said, military analysts
were giving less weight to the prospect of a U.S. counteroffensive
in Iran in favor of direct defense of the gulf itself.
   This change, the sources said, was based partly on a belief that
neither the Soviets nor the United States could long sustain major
military operations in a country where both terrain and politics
are hostile. The Zagros mountains have peaks of up to 18,000 feet.
   In December 1988, the retiring commander of U.S. Central
Command, Marine Gen. George B. Crist, was quoted as saying he had
proposed to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff a new plan for deploying
U.S. land, sea and air forces to defend key objectives from the
northern gulf to the Strait of Hormuz, 600 miles to the southeast.
   Crist said new intelligence indicated the Soviets would try to
seize such objectives rather than mount a major land thrust through
Iran.
   Any new strategy would require at least prolonging the
40-year-old American naval presence in the gulf, soon to be cut
from 10 to seven ships. In addition, a nine-ship carrier group is
in the Arabian Sea.
   But how large additional forces could be maintained without land
bases nearby is unclear. While privately welcoming the U.S.
military presence, the politically sensitive gulf states refused
during the Iran-Iraq war to allow U.S. bases on their territory.

<TEXT>
   The vanishing image of the hard-drinking,
chain-smoking reporter has lost more of its varnish _ America's
oldest press club has closed its doors.
   The 98-year-old Pen &amp; Pencil Club survived the death of more
than a dozen Philadelphia periodicals but now has fallen victim to
the changing drinking habits of journalists and the high-crime
neighborhood it moved to in 1986.
   More than a hundred people _ close to half the club's dwindling
membership _ jammed the bar Friday night, threatening the beer
supply.
   Stories were swapped _ about the card games in the 1950s that
would bring police raids, the time a couple got caught in the
restroom in an amorous clinch, the numerous ``raunchy'' parties.
   The club, chartered in 1892 and billed as America's oldest press
club by local newspapers and the National Press Club, has seen a
host of famous names cross its doorway.
   Red Smith and Damon Runyon were members. Guests included Mae
West, William Jennings Bryan and former Mayor Frank Rizzo.
   U.S. Presidents Hoover, Coolidge and Taft imbibed at the club's
bar _ according to club history, Taft skipped out on his tab.
   ``There were some wild times at the club,'' said Larry Fish, a
reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer. ``There was a real `Front
Page' atmosphere there.''
   The journalist as hard-drinker was firmly entrenched in
Americana after the premiere of ``The Front Page,'' a play of the
1920s that portrayed reporters as ``hoodlumesque half-drunken
caballeros.''
   Inquirer reporter Tom Belden said the changing drinking habits
of reporters caused the club's demise.
   When he first began coming to the club in 1979, ``there were a
dozen or so single men who would drop $20 to $50 a night. They kept
the bar going themselves.''
   But journalism is no longer dominated by single men, he said,
and married people tend to stay home with their family more often.
``And drink more orange juice than liquor,'' he added.
   The National Press Club, based in Washington, D.C., estimated
that 22 press clubs closed between 1982 and 1985.
   The Philadelphia club had been located above a diner about
halfway between buildings housing the Inquirer and The Evening
Bulletin. When the Bulletin folded in 1982, the club decided to
move closer to the Inquirer building.
   That move was seen by many as the beginning of the end.
   ``We thought people getting off work in the afternoon would
wander over for a drink,'' said Fish, who was on the club's board
at the time. ``But every time I came over, there'd be nobody here.''
   Members said the new location, on the edge of a poorer,
high-crime neighborhood, caused many people to stay away. Several
people Friday had stories of their cars being vandalized.
   Also gone were the scores of ``associate members,'' those not in
the profession who would stop by the downtown location.
   Before voting to close the Pen &amp; Pencil, club officials even
considered holding aerobics classes and child-care groups _ moves
the older reporters dismissed.
   The Pen &amp; Pencil was losing $300 to $400 a week when the club's
officers voted last month to close down.
   Jack Sherzer, a Harrisburg Patriot-News reporter, traveled two
hours for Friday night's farewell.
   ``Journalists are a loner crowd and without a place like this,
well,'' he said, shrugging, ``where are we going to go to meet?''

<HEAD>Report Says Paramilitary Squads Main Human Rights Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Right-wing paramilitary groups funded by drug
traffickers pose the biggest threat to human rights in Colombia and
investigations of their crimes are often hindered by police,
according to a U.N. report.
   The report published Friday urged Colombian authorities to
dismiss anyone in the armed forces or police found to have
cooperated with the death squads.
   The report by Amos Wako, to be presented to the U.N. Human
Rights Comission, said that for many years murder had been the main
cause of death among adults in Colombia.
   It called for an international fund be established to help
protect judges and witnesses and more international to increase the
number of police investigators and improve their training.
   In the first nine months of last year 2,337 people lost their
lives as a result of political and military conflict, the report
said.
   It said 603 victims were white-collar workers, most of them
government employees killed in retaliation for the government's
clampdown on drug traffickers.
   The report said another 456 victims were peasants who were labor
activists or suspected of sympathizing with the various
anti-government guerrilla groups.
   Most died at the hands of the estimated 140 paramilitary groups
trained and financed by drug barons and operating closely with
``elements'' in the armed forces and police, it said.
   It said in some cases police ignored the crimes, hindered
investigations or offered safe conduct passes to paramilitary
members.
   Wako cited concerns by some private human rights groups in
Colombia that existing foreign aid was mainly military in character
and focused more on countering anti-government guerrillas rather
than drug traffickers or paramilitary squads.
   The report also criticized violence and blackmail tactics used
by left-wing guerrillas. It welcomed efforts by President Virgilio
Barco's government to promote dialogue with the insurgency
movements.
   Wako, a Kenyan, wrote the report following a 10-day U.N. mission
to Colombia in October.

<TEXT>
   The acquittal of reputed mob boss John Gotti on
charges he ordered the shooting of a union official brought cheers
in court and a celebration in the Queens neighborhood where the
``Dapper Don'' is king.
   Gotti, the man authorities call America's No. 1 organized crime
boss, won his third victory over government prosecutors Friday when
a jury found him innocent of assault and conspiracy.
   His co-defendant, Anthony Guerrieri, was also acquitted.
   Gotti's supporters applauded loudly as the verdict was read,
provoking Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin to threaten them with 30
days in jail if they didn't stop.
   Gotti, who favors $1,800 suits and pinkie rings, kissed his
lawyer Bruce Cutler after the verdict and left the Manhattan
courthouse without commenting
   A short time later, he arrived at a favorite hangout in
Manhattan's Little Italy and was cheered wildly by people waiting
for him on the street. Two women kissed him before he ducked
inside. Later fireworks were set off.
   Near another Gotti hangout, the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club in the
borough of Queens, residents decorated homes and stores with
balloons and signs congratulating Gotti on his acquittal.
   ``We're happy he won. He's a good man to have on the avenue,''
said resident Phyllis Maccarelli.
   Gotti, 49, allegedly assumed control of the Gambino family after
the December 1985 execution of ``Big Paul'' Castellano and his
bodyguard outside a Manhattan restaurant.
   Since then, Gotti has been tried three times and won each case.
He was cleared in 1986 of beating a man in a traffic dispute after
the victim claimed he could not identify Gotti; he was acquitted
the next year in a federal racketeering case.
   When he was arrested on the latest charge, Gotti said his odds
of winning were 3 to 1.
   Gotti and Guerrieri were accused of commissioning the Westies, a
Hell's Kitchen gang, to shoot John F. O'Connor on May 7, 1986. He
was shot in the buttocks and survived.
   The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky,
said Gotti arranged the shooting because O'Connor ordered thugs to
vandalize a mob-run restaurant being built with non-union labor.
   The government's case was damaged when O'Connor, in testimony,
denied knowing who had ordered him shot.
   ``We think it was a fair trial, but we're disappointed,''
Cherkasky said after the verdict.
   Cutler, Gotti's lawyer, said, ``This verdict shows you can't put
people in jail by calling them names, calling them gangsters and
things like that.''
   The defense lawyers ridiculed the prosecution's main evidence:
the testimony of former Westie member James McElroy and scarcely
audible tapes secretly recorded in 1986 in the Rikers Island jail
visiting room and at the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club.
   Cutler and Shargel said a key tape on which Gotti allegedly
says, ``We're gonna, gonna bust him up,'' is inaudible and that
prosecutors transcribed it to suit their theory that Gotti had
O'Connor shot.
   ``I did not hear anything in these tapes that would lead me to
believe Mr. Gotti had a hand in this assault,'' juror Richard
Silensky said.
   Another juror who wouldn't give his name said: ``There was
nothing to connect Mr. Gotti to what happened. Zilch.''
   The jurors were sequestered for security reasons throughout the
three-week trial.
   McElroy, who testified that he was part of the group that shot
O'Connor as a favor to Gotti, was portrayed by the defense as a
liar who hoped to shorten the 60-year prison term he is serving and
get better terms for his girlfriend in a drug case.
   O'Connor testified as a surprise witness for the defense. He
admitted his union was plagued by internal troubles and
acknowledged it was possible that a union rival could have arranged
the shooting.
   The judge told the jurors they could convict the defendants only
if the prosecution proved they arranged the shooting and not simply
because they might be members of organized crime.
   Had he been convicted, Gotti could have faced 25 years to life
in prison as a persistent felon because of convictions in 1969 and
1974. In the latter case, Gotti plea-bargained down to an attempted
manslaughter charge in the slaying of a man in a Staten Island bar.

   Sixteen days before the presidential
election, the leftist government honored a pledge and freed nearly
1,000 Contra guerrillas and the last 39 jailed members of former
President Anastasio Somoza's National Guard.
   President Daniel Ortega, who is running for re-election,
proposed the pardon earlier this month. The pardon _ and the
release Friday _ deprived his major opponent, Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, of a campaign issue for the Feb. 25 election.
   The release was witnessed by diplomats, four Contra commanders
who have laid down their arms, international election observers and
church and Red Cross representatives.
   The Sandinista government made the most of the ceremony, taking
several busloads of reporters to the Juan Navarro Central
Penitentiary, where the inmates stood in lines in front of the
assembled dignitaries.
   Among the guardsmen were men accused of the most serious crimes
committed during the rule of Somoza, who was toppled by the
Sandinistas in 1979.
   ``As a soldier, I obeyed the orders of my superiors; I didn't do
anything without orders,'' said former Maj. Hugo Torres, who
admitted to being part of a secret squad accused of killing
opponents of Somoza.
   Somoza was assassinated Sept. 17, 1980, in Asuncion, Paraguay,
where he lived in exile.
   Many guardsmen imprisoned after summary trials in ``people's
courts,'' like Torres, claim they have been held illegally and say
they were tortured.
   ``I'm innocent; I fought with arms, like the others,'' said
former Maj. Jose Enrique Mungia Barrios. He allegedly killed Carlos
Fonseca, a hero of the revolution and a founder of the Sandinistas,
in combat.
   Torres, 54, whipped off his baseball cap when the national
anthem was played and stood at attention, holding it over his heart.
   ``I'm a professional soldier,'' he said. ``I'm proud to have
been in the National Guard.''
   Somoza's army is probably the most reviled symbol of his
government in a country where the new governing party has tried to
keep alive the passion of its revolution.
   Barricada, the Sandinista party newspaper, published photographs
of former guardsmen running for various local offices on the
opposition coalition's ticket. ``Would you vote for the Somoza
guard?'' it asked.
   Sandinista officials have said the decision to free the last
guardsmen and the Contras shows their humanity. The guerrillas were
believed to be nearly all those left in prison.
   Ortega's government released more than 1,800 former guardsmen
last year in an amnesty stipulated by a Central American peace
agreement. Those released Friday were kept in prison either because
of the seriousness of their crimes or their refusal to accept
political re-education.
   They included ex-Col. Isaias Cuadra, 56, who allegedly tortured
Interior Minister Tomas Borge while Somoza was in power; and former
Maj. Orlando Felipe Hislop, 45, accused of torturing the woman who
now heads the Sandinista police.
   Franco Montealegre, director of prisons, said earlier this week
most of the Contras also had refused re-education.
   The pardon, approved earlier this week by the
Sandinista-controlled National Assembly, covered 994 imprisoned
members of the U.S.-supported rebel army.
   Diogenes Hernandez, a former Contra commander who attended the
ceremony as a guest, said the pardon would help build a ``climate
necessary for national reconciliation.''

   Larry Rigby gambled five years ago on a
biomedical device that mimics the human lung. If it pays off,
beating long odds, his tiny company could become a life-giving
giant.
   Rigby, a venture capitalist, teamed up with Dr. J.D. Mortensen
to found CardioPulmonics Inc., maker of the experimental lung
device that was implanted in a teen-ager who died earlier in the
week.
   The operation was the first time a person had received the
IntraVascular Oxygenator, dubbed IVOX, which has been approved by
federal regulators in patients who have little chance of survival.
   The device, which works like a lung, is a 20-inch bundle of
hollow polypropylene fibers designed to handle as much as half the
body's oxygen delivery and elimination of carbon dioxide. It was
designed for patients suffering acute but reversible lung disease
or injury.
   ``I think it's very promising technology,'' Rigby said ``We
could be a $100 million company in five years if the technology is
what we think it is.''
   Rigby said he was pleased that the instrument functioned as
expected during its first human trial, but sounded a cautionary
note.
   ``This is research,'' he said. ``You just can't make leaping
conclusions from one example.''
   Under guidelines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, the IVOX will be tested in up to 10 people who
require 100 percent oxygen to detect possible tissue damage.
   Suffering from respiratory distress syndrome, Melicia ``Mimi''
Harvey, 16, of Arthur City, Texas, died Wednesday of pulmonary
failure at LDS Hospital four days after the implant. Tim Madden, a
spokesman at the hospital, said there were no clinical
complications from the device.
   If the device proves successful, up to 200,000 patients annually
in the United States and more in Japan and Europe could be
recipients, Rigby said. But the company, which employs 32 people,
must overcome marrying high techology with sound business practices.
   ``Marketing is the tough chore. A lot of the smaller companies
look for small speciality niches, where a large company wouldn't be
interested in competing,'' said Bob Brewer of Utah Technology
Finance Corp., an independent state agency that gave a small amount
of seed money to CardioPulmonics.
   ``Some succeed, others have difficulties,'' he said.
   The company was founded in 1985 with money from the two
co-founders and Mortensen's $550,000 grant from the federal Small
Business Innovation program.
   By last year Rigby had secured $7.7 million from five investment
companies that now own controlling stock in the privately held
company.
   ``As a business opportunity, something like this is very
long-range, and investors need very deep pockets, but the return in
the end could be very substantial,'' he said.
   If the IVOX reaches the market, its external gas pressure
regulator will sell for about $10,000, and the disposable
oxygenator for about $2,500 each.
   IVOX offshoots, such as the coating that prevents blood clots on
the fibrous bundle, also could be marketed to manufacturers of
surgical instruments, Rigby said.
   He said CardioPulmonics has had inquiries from scores of
domestic and foreign medical institutions and a few Japanese
companies whose identities he won't reveal.

<HEAD>Crematorium Operator to be Tried in Poisoning of Rival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former mortician serving a sentence for
mutilating corpses was charged with murder in the poisoning death
of a competitor in 1985, authorities said.
   The case against David Wayne Sconce, 33, of Pasadena is believed
to be the nation's first prosecution of a death by oleander
poisoning, said Deputy District Attorney Harvey Giss.
   Sconce, former operator of the Lamb Funeral Home, will be tried
in Ventura County for the death of Timothy Raymond Waters, 24, who
ran the Alpha Society cremation service in Burbank, Giss said.
   Sconce was charged Friday with first-degree murder with the
special circumstances of murder by poison. A conviction under the
special circumstances allegation could bring the death penalty.
   Arraignment was scheduled Feb. 26 in Ventura Municipal Court.
   Sconce was sentenced to five years in state prison last
September after he pleaded guilty to mutilating corpses, conducting
mass cremations and stealing dental gold from bodies.
   He also pleaded guilty to hiring thugs to beat up three
competing morticians, including Waters, failure to bury the body of
a baby girl, and car theft.
   It was during a preliminary hearing concerning the macabre
charges involving the funeral home's operations that witnesses
testified Sconce had bragged about poisoning Waters.
   The comments prompted authorities to re-open an investigation
into Waters' death. Waters died April 8, 1985, at his parents' home
in Camarillo.
   The Ventura County coroner's office initially determined the
death stemmed from natural causes, but ruled it was murder after a
second autopsy revealed traces of oleander poison in blood and
tissue samples.
   Testimony in a preliminary hearing revealed Sconce possessed a
book entitled, ``The Poor Man's James Bond,'' which featured a
chapter on how to kill by oleander poisoning. Oleander is a
poisonous evergreen shrub.
   Deaths from oleander poisoning are rare. Some cases are
accidental as in a California case several years ago when a woman
died after brewing an oleander tea from what she thought were
harmless leaves.

<HEAD>Perrier Recalls Inventory After Tests Find Benzene in Some Bottles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. inventory of Perrier mineral
water is being recalled because laboratory tests found benzene in a
small number of bottles.
   Chronic exposure to benzene has been found to cause adult
leukemia, birth defects and other ailments. But Perrier's U.S.
distributor said the Food and Drug Administration advised the
company there is no serious health concern if it's consumed in
small amounts.
   The Perrier Group of America Inc. announced the voluntary recall
Friday.
   ``While experts tell us short-term consumption of the product
poses no significant health risks to the general population, we're
trying to act aggressively and responsibly in the interests of the
public,'' said Ronald V. Davis, president of Perrier Group of
America.
   The company is recalling stock still in its possession, and
expects stores to follow suit, said Jane Lazgin, a Perrier
spokeswoman.
   Benzene is a clear, flammable liquid used as a solvent and in
making lacquers, varnishes and dyes.
   Perrier water is drawn from a natural underground mineral spring
in Vergeze, France, and bottled only at the source, Lazgin said.
The French Ministry of Health has certified that there is no
contamination at the spring, the company said.
   The search for a possible cause of the chemical intrusion is
focusing on the packaging and distribution process, Lazgin said.
   Perrier is conducting an internal investigation, and is also
cooperating with federal and state authorities, who are testing the
products.
   The Greenwich-based Perrier Group of America is an independent
subsidiary of Source Perrier of France. It distributes and markets
Perrier in the United States.

<HEAD>Libya is Making Poison Gas, Reports Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German opposition politicians said a
Libyan chemical plant allegedly built with West German help has
begun to produce poison gas.
   Reinhard Kraemer, a spokesman for the environmentalist Greens
party in Bonn, said Friday the Greens have received information
from the government that the plant has produced enough poison gas
for 1,000 artillery shells.
   The Libyan government denied the plant was making poison gas,
and the West German government refused to comment. But U.S.
officials said the plant had started producing chemicals, possibly
for chemical weapons.
   The plant, 60 miles south of Tripoli in the town of Rabta,
caused a huge scandal last year with U.S. allegations that West
German firms helped build the plant.
   West Germany at first denied the allegations, but it ultimately
launched its own investigation and accused the Imhausen-Chemie firm
of helping build the Libyan plant. The investigation has not yet
been concluded.
   A government spokesman in Bonn, when asked about the new report
that production had begun at the plant, said: ``We cannot take a
position at this time.''
   A U.S. official in Washington said Friday that the Libyans have
been producing ``very small'' amounts of chemicals, possibly for
weapons use, for about a year.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plant
60 miles south of Tripoli is producing nowhere near its design
capacity and that the United States is monitoring the situation.
   The Libyan government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi has denied the
Rabta plant was designed to produce poison gas, saying it is for
the production of pharmaceuticals.
   Ali Sunni Muntasser, Libya's deputy representative to the United
Nations, said Friday night, ``All these stories about manufacturing
gases or chemicals or anything is untrue.''
   However, Albrecht Mueller, a federal lawmaker with the main
opposition Social Democratic Party, said he was told by a West
German government official the Rabta plant is making poison gas.
   He said the information was released during a meeting Wednesday
of the parliamentary Economics Committee.
   ``I gathered from the meeting the production started last
year,'' Mueller said in a telephone interview.
   He said an Economics Ministry official identified the chemical
name as ``Lost,'' which is a military term for
dichlordiaethylsulphide, a poison gas used to disable enemy
soldiers.
   Mueller said he did not recall the name of the official who
released the information.
   The lawmaker said he had heard from other sources that the Rabta
plant has produced more than 20 tons of the poison gas since last
year. He would not identify the other sources.
   Other sources in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the matter came up at closed-door meetings of the parliamentary
Foreign Committee as well as the Economics Committee.

<HEAD>Man With Amnesia Awaits Meeting People who Claim Him as Relative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Doe, a man who remembers only bits and
pieces of his life prior to last October, says he doesn't know what
to think about people claiming him as their lost relative.
   ``I don't know how to explain it. It's good, but I don't
remember any of these people,'' he said Friday in a telephone
interview.
   Doe said he last remembers being picked up by Topeka police as
he was wandering through a motel parking lot in October.
   He had no identification and told police he did not know his
name, address or anything else about his past.
   Since then, he's undergone extensive hypnotherapy and had his
fingerprints sent to the FBI.
   But the search for his identity produced only tiny clues until
Thursday night when Milwaukee television station WITI-TV aired a
report on Doe by WIBW-TV in Topeka.
   People in Wisconsin who saw the program claimed to be Doe's
relatives, according to Doe's therapist, Rick Selig.
   Selig said the presumed relatives say Doe is actually Melvin
Wolf, a 53-year-old small appliance repairman from Angleton, Texas.
They said Wolf left home Aug. 20 on a business trip, and never
returned.
   Donna Caske, Wolf's sister from Angleton, is expected to arrive
today in Topeka to determine whether Doe is actually Wolf, Selig
said.
   ``Legally, we can't say that this individual is Melvin Wolf
until we get confirmation with the fingerprints,'' said Selig, a
clinical social worker at the Topeka Psychiatric Clinic. Selig has
worked with Doe since he was found in October.
   But Selig and authorities said it's possible that Doe is Wolf.
   Selig said that about a month ago during hypnosis, Doe began to
recall certain details of his life, such as a U.S. Army serial
number, a farm scene, and the first names of his parents. He also
spoke fluent German and stated that he served in Germany during
World War II, Selig said. He recalled vivid details of Berlin, and
remembered that he once owned a 1966 Dodge van.
   The serial number belonged to Melvin Wolf, Selig said, and all
other information he gave under hypnosis had been corroborated
Friday with Mrs. Caske and people in Wisconsin also claiming to be
relatives.
   Topeka police Sgt. Greg Halford said authorities plan to check
Doe's fingerprints with Wolf's and meet with Mrs. Caske and other
relatives.
   ``We do not think this is a hoax,'' Halford said.
   Selig said Doe spoke Friday on the telephone with Mrs. Caske and
others claiming to be relatives, but he did not remember them. Mrs.
Caske said Wolf lived with her.
   ``Hopefully, (seeing them) will spark some memories for him,''
said Selig, who diagnosed Doe as suffering from psychogenic amnesia
_ a total memory loss that can come from some ``extraordinarily
stressful event, a very painful event.
   After a lengthy hospital stay, Doe has been living at a halfway
house in Topeka.
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Doe said about today's meeting.
``I'm nervous, excited, scared _ everything you can say. ... I hope
when I see them I remember.''

   Twin robbery suspects held a sheriff
hostage in the county courthouse for four hours before one of the
18-year-olds killed his brother and himself, authorities said.
   The sheriff was unharmed.
   The standoff ended about 9:50 p.m. Friday when one of the
identical twins, Brad Jordan, killed his brother, Chad, with a
single shot to the head and then turned the weapon on himself, said
Assistant County Prosecutor Jerry Ault.
   The Jordans had been brought from jail to the sheriff's
courthouse office for questioning about a string of robberies they
allegedly committed 10 days earlier in three northeastern Ohio
towns.
   The twins overpowered Deputy Deb Strine and took her 9mm pistol,
then held her hostage until Sheriff Dale Shetler, 43, exchanged
himself for Strine, said sheriff's officer Gregory Kemp.
   Ms. Strine was released about 6:20 p.m. Shetler was in the room
when Jordan killed his brother and himself, Kemp said.
   Sandra Teeters, mother of the twins, and other family members
were helping police negotiate with the brothers when the shooting
occurred.
   ``We gave both of them a chance, the mother and their brother.
Both of them tried their damnedest but it didn't work,'' Ault said.
   Ms. Teeters said her sons had often been in trouble.
   ``Up to now, they've just been hyperactive,'' she said. ``Some
stealing and robbing. I tried but I just couldn't control them.''
   ``It should never have ended like this,'' said Ed Teeters, a
stepbrother of the twins. ``They were attention grabbers; they
always ached for attention.''
   Autopsies were scheduled for today, officials said.

   Former President Reagan will give a videotaped
deposition for John Poindexter's trial in his first in-depth
questioning on the Iran-Contra affair since his two interviews with
the Tower Commission.
   In those interviews conducted three years ago by the
Reagan-appointed commission, Reagan said he couldn't remember when
he had approved arm sales to Iran.
   Reagan on Friday consented to a videotaped deposition in which
Poindexter's lawyers will ask him 154 questions, plus follow-up
questions.
   The subject areas will include Reagan's knowledge of Oliver
North's activities on behalf of the Contras and whether Reagan
authorized written responses to Congress relating to the Nicaraguan
rebels. Poindexter now faces felony charges in connection with
those responses to Congress.
   Details on timing and other arrangements for the videotaped
testimony will be worked out Monday in a hearing before U.S.
District Court Judge Harold Greene, who will preside at the
Poindexter trial, scheduled to start Feb. 20.
   Reagan proposed to answer the questions Feb. 16 in Los Angeles.
   Reagan said in a court filing that he recognizes the courts have
a responsibility to protect Poindexter's rights. But his lawyers
also said Reagan retains the right to invoke executive privilege to
specific questions during the deposition.
   Indicating they expect Bush administration representatives to be
permitted to attend the deposition, Reagan's lawyers said they will
``defer to the incumbent president'' regarding issues of executive
privilege on national security or foreign affairs.
   The former national security adviser is charged with conspiracy,
two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements.
   Greene will attend the deposition to rule on disputes. Claiming
executive privilege to specific questions could result in halting
the deposition in mid-stream and taking the matter through court
appeals. Or, more likely, the deposition would continue while the
specific questions at issue remain unanswered, pending appeals.
   The ``videotape deposition format will provide an appropriate
mechanism ... to protect sensitive, classified national security
information and confidential deliberations,'' Reagan's lawyers said.
   The edited videotape would be shown at Poindexter's trial.
   Reagan told the commission led by former Sen. John Tower,
R-Texas, that he did not know the National Security Council staff
was engaged in helping the Contras. The board said it was aware of
no evidence to suggest Reagan was aware of North's activities on
behalf of the Contras when North was an NSC aide.
   Poindexter, however, will ask Reagan whether he knew far more
than he told the Tower Commission about North's activities.
   Poindexter also plans to ask Reagan if he approved responses to
Congress inquiring into whether North was assisting the Contras.
   In the responses, Poindexter endorsed letters sent to Congress a
year earlier by then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane
denying North was raising money or providing military advice to the
Contras. McFarlane in 1988 pleaded guilty to withholding
information from Congress in connection with the letters.
   Reagan also would be asked about discussions with Poindexter
regarding a chronology on the Iran arms sales that is involved in
four of the five criminal charges against Poindexter.
   The chronology, prepared by others at Poindexter's direction,
falsely states that no one in the U.S. government knew until
January 1986 that a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment from Israel
to Iran contained Hawk missiles.
   When Reagan first met with the Tower Commission, he said he had
approved the shipment of arms from Israel to Iran in August 1985.
But he changed his statements in his second meeting, saying he
hadn't approved the first shipment but authorized later ones.
   A week later, he wrote the Tower Board to saying simply, ``I
cannot recall'' whether he approved an Israeli sale in advance.

<HEAD>Conservatives, Reformers Fight to Nominate Candidate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a fight that may set the pace of
political reform, governing party factions are battling over the
selection of a running mate for President Lee Teng-hui, who is
expected to be nominated for re-election Sunday.
   The outcome of the struggle between conservatives and reformers
may also help determine how long Chiang Kai-shek loyalists _ many
in their 80s _ remain in their powerful positions.
   One conservative favorite for running mate is Chiang Wego, a
former general and son of Chiang Kai-shek.
   His father lost the civil war to the Communists on the mainland
and fled to Taiwan in 1949, where he led an authoritarian regime
for four decades.
   The struggle for a presidential partner has been hard fought.
Liu Kuo-tsai, speaker of the legislature, quoted the president
today as saying he was ``exhausted mentally and physically'' over
the choice.
   December elections gave urgency to the task of overhauling the
Nationalist Party. The governing party lost several key local seats
to the opposition and overall gained 58 percent of the vote, down
from 70 percent in 1986.
   The elections were the first multiparty vote since the lifting
of 38 years of martial law.
   Chang Chung-tung, a history professor of National Taiwan
University, said: ``People want President Lee to establish a
democratic insitution rather than becoming another dictator.''
   In the Nationalist Party convention Sunday, 180 members of the
party's Central Committee are widely expected to nominate Lee for
another six years as president. The Central Committee includes many
military and government officials who pledged allegiance to Lee
after he succeeded another of Chiang Kai-shek's sons, President
Chiang Ching-kuo. He died in office in 1988.
   Lee will then announce his running mate, and the committee will
vote on his choice.
   Elderly members of the National Assembly, Taiwan's electoral
college which will meet in March to elect the president and vice
president, have lobbied for a conservative running mate as a
counterweight to Lee. He is considered a political reformer.
   Many of the Old Guard, who gained their positions as Chiang
Kai-shek loyalists, fear that if Lee picks a reformer like himself,
they will quickly be forced out of power. Loss of power will mean a
loss of salary and lucrative perks.
   Lee, the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist
government and party, gave no hint of his choice of a running mate
on the eve of the convention. His silence was an indication of his
difficulties in finding a compromise.
   Lee reportedly would like to pick his running mate from
reform-minded Cabinet ministers and officials such as James Soong,
secretary-general of the Nationalist Party.
   But observers say Lee must also appease the assemblymen to
prevent them from vetoing future reform bills.
   They occupy 658 of the 764 seats in the National Assembly, the
remainder being held by Taiwan-elected members and
Nationalist-appointed members from overseas Chinese. All of the
elderly members were elected before 1949 to permanent office to
support the Nationalist claim to be the sole legitimate rulers of
all China.
   More than 200 elderly assemblymen, mostly retired military
officials, have pledged support to Chiang Wego, a 74-year-old
former army general who is secretary general of the National
Security Council.
   Chiang has said he doesn't want the job, but he had not ruled it
out if he is asked.
   Many elderly assemblymen also support 73-year-old Premier Lee
Huan.

   Bank of New England, faced with losses of more
than $1 billion for 1989, has collected its paintings, Gobelin
tapestries and other valuables and packed them off for sale.
   ``I don't know of any of our customers who do business with us
because we have a couple of valuable pictures,'' said new Board
Chairman H. Ridgely Bullock.
   The nine rare tapestries, named for a 15th century French
family, once adorned palace walls. They had been hung in two of the
bank's offices.
   The 50 paintings put up for sale from the Boston offices include
several by Maxfield Parrish, George Innes and Robert Rauschenberg.
   There was no immediate estimate how much the sale of the art
works will realize.
   The bank, which blames its red ink problems chiefly on bad real
estate loans, already has sold off assets totaling more than $1.1
billion.

   Severe thunderstorms were expected to continue today from the
Gulf Coast into the Southeast, while mild weather was forecast over
much of the Rockies to the Plains.
   Unseasonable warmth continued to prevail in much of the eastern
and central United States, though a slow-moving cold front should
start ushering in cooler temperatures. Ahead of the front, rain was
expected along much of the East Coast, with flooding possible in
parts of New England.
   Temperatures today from Montana to Oklahoma were expected to be
20 degrees above normal.
   Three tornadoes were reported Friday. One near Nacogdoches,
Texas, and another near Fairview-Alpha, La., caused heavy damage to
buildings, power lines and trees, authorities said. A third tornado
near Ashport, Tenn., caused no damage or injuries.
   Afternoon thunderstorms produced large hail, up to the size of
golf balls in Little Rock, Ark., and San Antonio, Texas, the
National Weather Service reported. The hail knocked out windows in
homes and cars.
   ``We've had rainfall across the area of 4 to 14 inches,'' said
weather service forecaster Ernest Ethridge. ``The rain fell
quickly. It's not that we have too much, but the ground is wet and
the bayous are full.''
   Thunderstorm wind gusts damaged about 30 homes east of Rosebud,
Ark., and overturned a large truck and motor home near Osceola, Ark.
   In Calhoun, La., a woman died and her grandson was injured when
a wind gust carried her trailer home almost 30 feet and flipped it
over, Ouachita Parish sheriff's deputies said.
   Bad weather also caused problems in Ellensburg, Wash., where
heavy snow kept Interstate 90 closed at Snoqualmie Pass.
   Other parts of the nation basked in unseasonbly warm
temperatures. Record highs set Friday for the date included 72
degrees in Charleston, W.Va.; 66 in Baltimore; 63 in New York; 49
in Boston; 55 in Portland, Maine; 58 in Mansfield, Ohio; and 93 in
Corpus Christi, Texas.
   High temperature for the Lower 48 states Friday was 94 degrees
at Alice, Texas.
   Other reports at 4 a.m. EST:

   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
challenged the Soviet Union today to end military and financial
support to Marxist Cuba and came under a blizzard of criticism from
Soviet officials about U.S. arms spending and the invasion of
Panama.
   Baker, in an unprecedented appearance before the Soviet
legislature, lectured his hosts about the ``darkness at noon'' era
of the past and said the American people and Congress cannot
understand how the Soviet government can send billions of rubles of
assistance to countries like Cuba and Nicaragua.
   Not only were those countries supporting subversion in the
Western hemisphere, Baker said, but the Soviet aid ``is even less
comprehensible when it happens at a time when your people clearly
need those scarce resources put to good use at home.''
   Baker spoke before the International Affairs Committee of the
Supreme Soviet in an 18th century ceremonial hall with a marble
bust of Lenin behind him. His appearance marked the first time a
U.S. government official appeared in the legislative chamber, an
event Baker attributed to reforms undertaken by President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   ``For over 40 years, we have waged a Cold War against one
other,'' Baker said. ``Now is the time to put the legacy of
struggle behind us. ... Now is the time to build a new legacy. Now
is the time to move beyond the Cold War.''
   But while complimenting the steps taken under Gorbachev,
including the historic decision this week to end the Communist
party's monopoly on political power, Baker salted his speech with a
thrust at Soviet support for Marxist countries.
   Three times in the course of replying to questions, Baker called
Soviet support for Cuba intolerable. He complained about the
shipment of new MiG jet fighter planes and questioned why Moscow
was aiding President Fidel Castro when he is so critical of
Gorbachev's policies.
   ``We remain especially disturbed by the military shipments your
government continues to send to those seeking military solutions to
conflicts in regions vital to us,'' he said.
   Several committee members challenged Baker on the invasion of
Panama and on several arms control fronts, including U.S. refusal
to join the Soviets in a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing or
to consider naval disarmament.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, a military adviser to Gorbachev,
said the United States at the end of World War II had encircled the
Soviet Union with military bases and had not retreated from that
policy.
   Akhromeyev, a leading figure in U.S.-Soviet arms control
accords, questioned why the U.S. administration only trimmed
defense spending, while the Soviets were cutting their defense
budget by 14 percent as East-West tensions ease.

<HEAD>Eight Bombs Explode But No Casualties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight bombs exploded today in the
stronghold of Moslem militants seeking independence for the
Himalayan valley of Kashmir, authorities said. No one was injured.
   Authorities said the blasts, at two banks, a post office and
other shops and businesses, occurred hours after fire swept through
a shopping complex in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir
state.
   No one claimed responsibilty for the explosions.
   Police said they believe the blaze was an accident since it
occurred before dawn while a curfew was still in force.
   But other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed
the fire and the bombs on the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, the
militant group leading the four-decade-old drive for the country's
only Moslem majority state to secede from predominantly Hindu India.
   India routinely blames neighoring Pakistan of arming, training
and supporting the militants. Pakistan denies the charge but says
the Kashmiri people have a right to self-determination.
   At least 82 people have been killed since Jan. 20 in frequent
street clashes between militants and security forces in Srinagar
and adjoining areas. Most of the victims have been protesters shot
while defying curfew imposed by government forces to stem rising
violence.
   The curfew was relaxed during the day from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
except in the areas where the explosions occurred.
   Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and
Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end
of British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding
areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir.
   Sixty-four percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems,
but Moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 million population
nationwide.
   Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with
Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem
population, but the militants now demand independence and the
status of a neutral country.
   India has fought two wars with Pakistan over Kashmir.

   Davis, who was diagnosed with throat cancer in September 1989,
was being treated for the recurrence at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Friday.
   The 64-year-old singer's specific condition was not released. He

<TEXT>
   Federal marine agents, concerned about reports
that boaters are harassing migrating gray whales, have orders to
write fines of up to $25,000 to anyone seen getting too close to
the whales.
   Agent Ray Sautter of the National Marine Fisheries Service said
Friday he called for the patrols today and Sunday after going on a
whale-watching cruise off San Diego's Point Loma last weekend.
   The Coast Guard will assist the fisheries agents, he said.
   ``I don't think anybody starts out their day by saying, `Let's
go harass some whales today.' I think they just want to get
closer,'' Sautter said. ``But when you start seeing boats that are
making course changes to pursue the whales and whales making course
changes to evade the boats that is a violation.''
   Sautter said he saw several pleasure boaters venturing too close
to the whales last week. Vessels should keep at least 100 yards
from the whales and aircraft must fly at a minimum altitude of
1,000 feet while within a 100-yard radius of the whales, he said.
   ``I don't want to scare people or blindside them,'' he said.
``We're just trying to get people to enjoy the whales, but to give
them a little bit of room.
   ``If you were out in South Dakota and saw a buffalo in the
middle of a field, you wouldn't drive your car out in the middle of
it to see the animal,'' he said. ``But that's what some people are
doing out in the water with the whales.''
   The gray whales, which are protected under the Marine Mammal
Protection Act, hug the Southern California coast on their journey
from Alaska to their breeding grounds off Baja California.

<HEAD>Tape By Reputed Mob Leader Played in Court Tells of Payoffs to
Officials</HEAD>

   Politicians shrugged off remarks by a reputed mob
leader in a secretly taped conversation that he had paid off local
officials and influenced last year's mayoral race.
   Two of the officials implicated in the tape played Friday at a
bond hearing, Cook County Sheriff James O'Grady and his former top
aide, county GOP Chairman James Dvorak, called for the appointment
of a special prosecutor.
   ``A full and impartial public hearing is the only way to answer
these allegations,'' O'Grady said in a statement.
   ``These allegations are absolutely preposterous,'' said Dvorak.
``This is merely one mobster boasting to another.''
   The statements, recorded in September, were made by reputed mob
gambling boss Rocco Infelice, 67, of suburban River Forest, who was
among 20 alleged mobsters whose indictments were announced
Wednesday by U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   On the tape played at Friday's hearing, Infelice said $10,000 a
month went to ``the sheriff,'' an apparent reference to O'Grady,
who said the remarks were untrue.
   An Internal Revenue Service agent who testified Friday said mob
officials identified Dvorak as the conduit through which money was
paid to the sheriff's office _ Dvorak vehemently denied this.
   ``If I was concerned about it, I'd be in Argentina right now,
not standing before you,'' Dvorak told reporters.
   On the tape, Infelice also said he had given Mayor Richard M.
Daley ``a lot of ... help in this last election,'' mostly by not
backing one of Daley's rivals, former Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, the
Republican candidate.
   Daley called the claim ``b.s.''
   ``What are they talking about?'' he said. ``We ran a good
campaign. All of a sudden, people like them are going to start
taking credit for my election?''
   Acting U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson said that Daley was not a
target of the federal investigation. He had no comment when he was
asked about the other officials.
   The tape played at the bond hearing was recorded by William
Jahoda, a bookmaker who agreed to cooperate with federal agents and
wore a concealed recorder, according to testimony.
   Jahoda was among those indicted Wednesday. The terms of his
agreement with prosecutors have not been disclosed.
   The government was attempting at the hearing before U.S.
Magistrate Thomas Rosemond to block bonds for Infelice and four
other defendants. The hearing was to continue Monday.
   The federal indictment charges Infelice with a variety of
offenses, including murder, racketeering conspiracy, illegal
gambling and tax cheating.
   Infelice's lawyer, Patrick Tuite, said he thought the
allegations on the tape were ``just a lot of hot air.''

<HEAD>Police: Three Children who Attended Center Have Sexual Disease</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three children who attended a
day-care center owned by a man charged with having child
pornography contracted a sexually transmitted disease, police said.
   Authorities said no evidence links the infections to the
preschool or its owner.
   Examinations found gonorrhea infections in the throats of three
of the dozens of children examined at Broward County's Sexual
Assault Treatment Center.
   The tests came after the arrest of preschool owner John W.
Shaver, 56, two weeks ago on five counts of possessing child
pornography for magazines police found at his home, across the
street from his Rainbow Learning Center.
   Police would not say whether the children who tested positive
were male or female and did not release their ages.
   Police have said 20 children who attended Shaver's preschool
were identified by their parents in hundreds of nude photographs
found at Shaver's house. The pictures do not depict sex acts or
sexual poses, but show the children at play, authorities said.
   ``This is an ongoing investigation, and we can't answer any
questions about the investigation itself,'' police Capt. Bruce
Smith said during a news conference late Friday.
   ``There is, however, no direct evidence linking the disease to
the facility'' or Shaver, Smith said.
   Police would not say whether Shaver tested positive for the
disease. He remained under treatment Friday at the Crisis
Stabilization Center in Pembroke Pines after cutting his wrist last
week in an apparent suicide attempt.
   Shaver has denied any wrongdoing during the widening police
investigation, saying ``I have not behaved improperly to any
child.''
   Neither police nor Joanne Richter, director of the treatment
center, could say how the children may have been infected.
   ``The most likely hypothesis is they were forced to perform oral
sex with the infected adult, most likely a male,'' said Dr. Sally
S. Atherton, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at
the University of Miami School of Medicine. ``It's not something
you pass around. It's a bacteria; it requires contact.''
   The children have been treated, police said. Most cases of
gonorrhea can be cured with penicillin or other antibiotics,
especially if the disease is diagnosed early.
   Shaver was released on $5,000 bond last week on the charges of
possessing child pornography, a third-degree felony punishable by a
maximum five-year prison sentence. Shaver has admitted owning the
magazines but denies taking nude photographs of children.
   Although the photographs themselves are not pornographic under
the law, they could lead to sexual exploitation accusations against
Shaver if the evidence meets that criteria, police have said.
   Police said they were being careful with the information they
release about the case to prevent hysteria.
   ``Our No. 1 concern is the children,'' Maj. Joe Donisi said.
``We don't want to traumatize the kids into thinking something has
happened.''
   Broward County officials shut down Shaver's day-care center last
week, contending Shaver ``lacked good moral character.'' About 200
children have attended the center since Shaver opened it in 1985
for children ages 3 to 5.

<TEXT>
   Protesters upset over incidents stemming from
the dismissal of a black superintendent promised to occupy Selma
High School and City Hall until the majority white school board
meets their demands.
   Many protesters planned to march today from a Selma church to
the Edmund Pettus bridge, a landmark in the civil rights movement
of 25 years ago, and then spend a second night in the high school
and city hall.
   Connie Tucker, a spokeswoman for the protests, said the march
would draw university students from across Alabama. The Rev. Joseph
Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
was expected to attend, she said.
   In 1965, state troopers attacked civil rights marchers on the
bridge. The marchers were on their way to a Montgomery
demonstration.
   A federal judge, citing the students' right to freedom of
speech, turned down city attorneys Friday who asked for him to
intervene and block further disruptions at the buildings, where the
protests have been orderly.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Butler of Mobile told J.L. Chestnut,
a lawyer for the protesters, he was reluctant for the federal
courts to step in but that excesses would force him to do so.
   ``He told me he recognized constitutional rights to exercise
free speech,'' Chestnut said.
   Chestnut said he told protest leaders of the judge's concerns
and indicated the buildings may be cleared by Monday.
   The racial turmoil began when six white members of the school
board voted not to extend the contract of Norward Roussell, the
city's first black superintendent. The dismissal of Roussell last
week ignited protests that led to the closing of two schools
Tuesday, and all 11 of Selma's public schools Wednesday.
   Roussell was reinstated after the initial protests. But the
students want the school board to extend his contract, which
expires this year.
   Four blacks protesting the dismissal of Roussell were arrested
Monday during a melee at the office of white Mayor Joe Smitherman,
who held office during the turmoil of the 1960s.
   A preliminary city report said allegations of police brutality
at the protest was unfounded.
   Protesters also have pushed for commitments for a better
education system for blacks.
   State Sen. Hank Sanders said the main issue is not that
schoolchildren missed days in the classroom. At stake, he said,
``is the quality of education for the future.''

   Nearly 500 refugees from Christian
battles in Lebanon arrived by ferry today at this port, telling
tales of dodging gunfire and of gunmen using civilians for cover.
   ``The Lebanese have done some futile things before, but this
must be the most futile ever,'' said one passenger, a British
official, of the fighting.
   The clashes between rival Christian forces have left more than
400 people dead since Jan. 30. Most victims have been civilians.
   The ferry Sunny Boat steamed into Larnaca on the south coast of
Cyprus after a nine-hour, 100-mile overnight voyage from Jounieh, a
Christian town 10 miles north of Beirut. It was the first ferry to
reach Lebanon in a week.
   The boat sailed for Lebanon on Friday after a shaky cease-fire
was declared between rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and the
Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea. Despite the truce, both
sides clashed today.
   Many of the refugees came from Christian districts of east
Beirut, which have been the scene of fierce battles.
   Many had huddled in basements and bomb shelters for days and
used the cease-fire to make a run for Jounieh.
   ``It's been terrible with all the fighting that raged around
us,'' said Hala Habash, a middle-aged Christian woman accompanied
by two teen-age children.
   ``It was very dangerous during the fighting. Gunmen moved from
house to house during the street fighting. They took no notice of
the people living in the houses,'' said Nawaz Ephraim, 19, who was
accompanying his mother and two younger sisters.
   ``Sometimes they used the presence of non-combatants in the
houses as cover,'' he said.
   A young mother with a little girl on her lap sat crying softly
as she waited at the Cypriot immigration desk for her passport to
be stamped.
   She refused to speak. But a friend said she had been separated
from her husband and a 10-day-old baby during the fighting.
   ``We don't know if they're alive or dead,'' the friend said.
   A distraught middle-aged woman with a heavily bandaged foot
limped off the ferry and her husband, who declined to be
identified, said she had been wounded in the fighting.
   The British official, one of two who said they were on official
business at their embassy in Beirut, said the damage in Dbaye had
been ``quite extraordinary.''
   He was referring to a coastal town north of Beirut that Aoun's
forces wrested from the Lebanese Forces in hand-to-hand fighting a
week ago.
   He said he and a companion had to drive to Jounieh from Beirut
by a circuitous route over the mountains because the main coastal
highway has been cut by the fighting.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached on Phased Plan for Elimination of Chemical
Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union today announced
preliminary agreement on an American plan for a phased elimination
of the two sides' chemical weapons.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said at a news
conference at the end of three days of talks with U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III that the Soviets had accepted the U.S.
proposal ``and as a result of negotiations have agreed on a
mutually acceptable draft of a prospective agreement of principle.''
   ``We believe such an agreement could be signed during President
Gorbachev's visit to the United States,'' he added. The Soviet
leader is scheduled to travel to Washington in June to meet with
President Bush.
   The announcement had been expected after Baker's talks with
Shevardnadze and Gorbachev.
   In a joint statement, the two sides pledged that after a
multilateral treaty is reached in negotiations in Geneva, they will
``reduce their chemical weapons stocks to equal levels at a very
small fraction of their present holdings over the first eight years
of operation of the convention.''
   ``All remaining chemical weapons stocks should be eliminated
over the subsequent two years,'' the statement said.
   The statement pledged the two sides to work out the last details
even while a conference on banning chemical weapons continues in
Geneva.
   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly last year, Bush
proposed to keep 2 percent of U.S. stockpiles of weapons until all
countries deemed capable of producing chemical weapons have signed
an international treaty.
   About a dozen countries, including Libya and Iran, are thought
to possess chemical weapons, although only the United States and
Soviet Union admit having the deadly substances.

<TEXT>
   A journalist closely tied to President Hosni
Mubarak today criticized PLO chief Yasser Arafat for failing to
condemn a terrorist massacre of nine Israelis on a bus in Egypt.
   The new criticism escalated a war of words over the attack
between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Egypt,
jeopardizing efforts to organize Israel-Palestinian peace talks.
   The article by editor Ibrahim Seda on the front page of the
mass-circulation weekly Akhbar el-Yom's was the third article
criticizing the PLO since the attack Sunday. But it was the first
that blamed Arafat himself.
   All three articles appeared in state-owned newspapers and were
written by their top editors, all known to be close to Mubarak.
   The media onslaught signaled strains in relations between Egypt
and the PLO. Such tensions imperil American efforts to organize
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks because Egypt has been relaying PLO
positions to both the United States and Israel.
   Israel outrage over the attack has also made organizing such
talks more difficult.
   Mubarak sent a message to Arafat this week that sources close to
the government said was believed to have voiced displeasure over
the PLO's reaction to the attack.
   The PLO said Monday in Tunisia that the incident should be
placed in the context of the hundreds of Palestinians who died in
the 26-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In his article, Seda called the statement ``flimsy and silly''
for omitting a denunciation of the terrorist attack and comparing
it to the violence in the occupied lands.
   The bus carrying 31 Israeli vacationers was attacked by two
gunmen, who showered it with automatic fire and hand grenades on a
desert highway between Cairo and the Suez Canal city of Ismailia.
Newspapers have quoted security officials as saying the gunmen were
Palestinians but that no arrests have been made.
   ``We expected Yasser Arafat to react by flying to Cairo
immediately to declare to the world his personal and the
Palestinian people's condemnation of this criminal act,'' Seda
wrote in his weekly, which claims a circulation of more than 1
million.
   He said Arafat should at least have broadcast a statement ``in
his own voice'' censuring the attack and vowing to ``help the
Egyptian security apparatus uncover the Palestinian terrorist
perpetrators.''
   The PLO's Cairo representative, Saeed Kamal, told the Middle
East News Agency today that his organization was cooperating with
Egyptian security authorities, passing to them any information it
had about the ambush.
   However, Kamal said he could not rule out the possibility of
``Israeli responsibility'' for the attack, aiming to obstruct peace
talks.
   The chill in Egyptian-PLO relations was the worst since Mubarak
shut down seven PLO offices in Egypt for seven months in 1987 after
the Palestine National Council, the organization's parliament in
exile, criticized Cairo's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
   Another state-owned newspaper, Al-Ahram, today reported that the
ambush was plotted inside Israel or the occupied territories.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified Interior Ministry official
for the report.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany arrived in
Moscow today for talks aimed at reassuring the Soviets that a
reunited Germany would not threaten their security.
   Kohl, accompanied by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
was to meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in one of a series
of high-level consultations planned in the East and West about
German reunification.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told a news conference
in Moscow before Kohl's arrival that one of the key issues to be
discussed was the need for a German guarantee on stable borders.
   He also expressed support for a ``neutral, demilitarized''
Germany.
   The chancellor has argued that Soviet security interests would
not be threatened if the two German states merged into a country of
80 million people in the heart of Europe.
   After returning from the weekend talks in Moscow, Kohl will meet
in Bonn with East German Premier Hans Modrow, see French President
Francois Mitterrand and meet President Bush in Camp David _ all in
one week.
   The issue of unification has assumed urgency in recent days
because of the instability of the East German economy.
   With Modrow, Kohl is expected to discuss plans to make the West
German mark the currency in both states. Bonn hopes such a move
would slow the exodus of people from East Germany who have lost
faith in their country's future.
   Nearly 2,000 East Germans are leaving their country daily,
crippling an economy already troubled by strikes and absenteeism.
   A high-ranking West German government official, briefing
reporters on Kohl's trip to Moscow on the condition of anonymity,
said East Germany could become insolvent in a matter of days. He
also said free elections, already moved up from May to March 18,
might have to be advanced further.
   The report was quickly denied by East German government
spokesman Wolfgang Meyer and by Kohl's own spokesman, Hans Klein.
Klein said the Bonn government did not think that East Germany's
economy is in danger of collapsing in the next few days, but that
some West German leaders believe that is the case.
   The official who briefed reporters said the grim assessment was
provided by some East German officials.
   Lothar de Maiziere, leader of the East German Christian
Democratic Party and one of Modrow's deputies in the Cabinet, was
quoted by West Germany's mass-circulation newspaper Bild as saying
the situation in the country could become critical in two or three
weeks.
   Since the ouster of hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker in
October and the opening of the Berlin Wall the following month,
reunification has become an urgent issue.
   Some Europeans, recalling Nazi Germany's march through Europe in
World War II, fear a united Germany could again become a military
threat.
   Genscher has sought to allay European fears by saying that both
nations should soon sign an agreement not to build nuclear weapons
or encroach on the borders of neighboring countries.
   The superpowers worry that such a union could make their
military alliances crumble. NATO has about 255,000 troops in West
Germany, most of them Americans. More than 380,000 Soviet soldiers
are stationed in East Germany, a key member of the Warsaw Pact.
   Modrow has proposed that a united Germany be neutral, but
Western nations have uniformly rejected that stand.
   Officials in Bonn have proposed that what is now West Germany
could remain with NATO and the territory that was East Germany
could technically be neutral.
   Genscher also proposed that the 35-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe meet in Berlin this fall to discuss new
security arrangements for Europe.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Harbor Pilots Call Launch Strike, Claim Unsafe

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shipping pilots who steer oil tankers and
freighters into Los Angeles Harbor struck today over what they call
unsafe working conditions that could trigger another massive oil
spill.
   At least one serious near-collision at the heavily traveled port
was due to conditions that included understaffing, fatigue, stress
and the hurried training of newcomers, said pilot Capt. Joe Silva,
president of the Los Angeles Pilots Association.
   ``We could have a disaster,'' Silva said in a telephone
interview today. ``It's totally unsafe to the public _ another
Valdez waiting to happen.''
   Port Capt. James C. Card ordered closure to the harbor of
vessels without a local pilot aboard, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
   Nine vessels were scheduled to enter the harbor this morning,
with two management pilot supervisors reportedly on hand to steer
four of them to anchorages, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Carolyn
Feldman.
   No immediate arrangements for the remaining five ships were made.
   Pilots voted Friday night to walk off the job at 3 a.m. today,
said Wallace Knox, attorney for the Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots Branch
68.
   Dock workers were expected to honor the strike, meaning the
vessels brought into the harbor would be unable to berth, Ms.
Feldman said.
   Telephone calls from The Associated Press to the Harbor
Department seeking comment on the strike early today went
unanswered.
   ``The Harbor Department has been ordering a number of unsafe
acts in the past several weeks and has been ordering untrained
pilots to bring vessels into the harbor,'' said Knox.
   He cited a near-collision Jan. 24 between an oil tanker and
another ship inside Los Angeles Harbor.
   The ships passed within 8 feet of each other, forcing one pilot
to drop anchor within the harbor channel, rupturing a fuel pipeline
in the process, Silva said.
   ``Despite such near misses, the Harbor Department has persisted
in irresponsible actions which raise serious safety concerns,''
Silva said.
   Silva said work weeks topping 84 hours were common, 10 pilots
often handled jobs designed for a staff of 16, and hiring officials
were slow to fill vacancies, prompting the rushed training of
newcomers.
   He said the harbor department had assigned the moving of vessels
``to a completely untrained trainee.'' Pilots had filed an action
over the safety violations with the Los Angeles Employee Relations
Board, he said.
   Branch 68 operates only in Los Angeles and none of its members
was involved in this week's Huntington Beach spill. Almost 300,000
gallons of Alaska crude spilled from the tanker American Trader on
Wednesday, possibly after the tanker was gashed by its own anchor.

   Hundreds of radical students shouting
anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans fought riot poice today with
firebombs and rocks to protest the creation of a new conservative
governing coalition.
   Shouting ``Crush the conservative dictatorship!'' 700 students
rushed out of Seoul's Jooang University and pelted riot police with
hundreds of firebombs and rocks. About 600 riot police stopped the
students at the school's main gate, firing barrages of tear gas
canisters.
   No police figures on injuries and arrests were immediately
available.
   The fighting began after 1,000 riot troopers sealed off Korea
University in eastern Seoul to stop a joint anti-government rally
involving radical students from major schools in Seoul.
   Radical students and dissidents have stepped up violent protests
against the merger of President Roh Tae-woo's governing party and
two moderate opposition groups led by Kim Young-sam and Kim
Jong-pil.
   The new coalition, the Democratic Liberal Party, excluded the
leftist opposition Party for Peace and Democracy, led by Kim
Dae-jung.
   In leaflets scattered today, the students claimed the merger was
instigated by the United States to establish a pro-U.S. government
in South Kroea. They also demanded the immediate withdrwal of U.S.
troops based under a mutual defense pact and shouted anti-U.S.
slogans.
   The new party will hold at least 210 of the 299 seats in the
National Assembly, enough to change the nation's constitution at
will.
   The unicameral assembly had been controlled by the three
opposition parties, led by Kim Dae-jung's party.
   On Friday, delegates from the three parties formally endorsed
their merger and ratified the new party's platform, constitution
and basic policies.
   The new governing party was formed with the goal of bringing
stability to the nation's faction-ridden politics, in which the
three opposition parties had been unable to settle their own feuds
to pass legislation.

   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
challenged the Soviet Union on Saturday to end military and
financial support to Marxist Cuba and came under a blizzard of
criticism from Soviet officials about U.S. arms spending and the
invasion of Panama.
   The tough question-and-answer session in an unprecedented
appearance before the Soviet legislature contrasted with upbeat
statements by both Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on their three days of talks, and an agreement on a
U.S. approach to banning chemical weapons.
   The two sides agreed on a 10-year phased elimination of their
chemical weapons tied to an international agreement in Geneva
negotiations.
   In an allusion to Arthur Koestler's novel about Stalinism, Baker
lectured his hosts about the ``darkness at noon'' era of the past
and said the American people and Congress cannot understand how the
Soviet government can send billions of rubles of assistance to
countries like Cuba and Nicaragua.
   Not only were those countries supporting subversion in the
Western hemisphere, Baker said, the Soviet aid ``is even less
comprehensible when it happens at a time when your people clearly
need those scarce resources put to good use at home.''
   Baker spoke in an 18th century ceremonial hall, with a marble
bust of Lenin behind him. His audience was the International
Affairs Committee of the Supreme Soviet. It was the first time a
U.S. government official had appeared in the legislative chamber,
an event Baker attributed to reforms undertaken by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``For over 40 years, we have waged a cold war against one
other,`` Baker said. ``Now is the time to put the legacy of
struggle behind us ... Now is the time to build a new legacy. Now
is the time to move beyond the cold war.''
   Shevardnadze, in a news conference, said a ``large measure of
progress'' had been made in the talks on a variety of arms control
issues and that an agreement on chemical weapons probably could be
signed at the Washington summit in June.
   Gorbachev, in a nearly three-hour meeting with Baker on Friday,
countered U.S. President George Bush's proposal for cutting the
number of soldiers in Central Europe. He urged Bush to extend the
plan to th entire continent, including 30,000 troops excluded by
the U.S. plan.
   While complimenting the steps taken under Gorbachev, including
the historic decision this week to end the Communist Party's
monopoly on political power, Baker salted his speech with a thrust
at Soviet support for Marxist countries.
   Three times Baker called Soviet support for Cuba intolerable. He
complained about the shipment of new MiG jet fighter planes and
questioned why Moscow was aiding President Fidel Castro when he is
so critical of Gorbachev's policies.
   ``We remain especially disturbed by the military shipments your
government continues to send to those seeking military solutions to
conflicts in regions vital to us,'' he said.
   Several committee members challenged Baker on the invasion of
Panama and on several arms control fronts, including U.S. refusal
to join the Soviets in a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing or
to consider naval disarmament.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, a military adviser to Gorbachev,
said the United States at the end of World War II had encircled the
Soviet Union with military bases and had not retreated from that
policy.
   Akhromeyev, a leading figure in U.S.-Soviet arms control
accords, questioned why the U.S. administration only trimmed
defense spending, while the Soviets were cutting their defense
budget by 14 percent as East-West tensions ease.
   Yevgeny M. Primakov, chairman of the Soviet of the Union, one of
the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet, challenged the Bush
administration to join the Soviet Union in guaranteeing not to use
force in Latin America.
   Baker also was pressed to explain why U.S. warships were exempt
from arms control negotiations.
   In reply, Baker returned to the issue of Soviet support for Cuba
and Nicaragua. He said the military action in Panama was unique and
designed to remove Gen. Manual Noriega from power while restoring
democracy.
   The secretary of state also said a strong navy was essential to
the United States, which he described as sort of an island nation.
   The 90-minute session wound up Baker's four-day visit to Moscow,
which was capped by a Gorbachev counterproposal to President Bush
on troop reductions in Europe and headway toward arms control
agreements.
   Baker then headed for Bulgaria, a Soviet ally in the midst of a
rocky evolution away from hard-line communism. He will stop Sunday
in Romania, which is undergoing an even rougher transition, before
traveling to Ottawa, Canada, for a meeting with the foreign
ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw
Pact.
   Baker appeared before the committee after conducting marathon
talks Friday with Gorbachev and other Soviet officials, during
which he said progress was made toward agreements cutting
long-range nuclear warheads and chemical weapons.
   Gorbachev urged the United States to remove 30,000 more U.S.
troops from Europe by extending Bush's troop ceiling for Europe's
central front to the entire continent.
   Among questions remaining after Baker's talks with Soviet
leaders are the superpower differences over West and East Germany.
The Soviet Union insists a unified Germany should be neutral; Baker
pressed the U.S. position that a united Germany should continue an
``association with'' NATO.
   On arms control, Baker said the two sides settled the questions
of access to missile data during flight tests, where to store
non-deployed missiles and how many air-launched cruise missiles may
be carried by bombers. But details about the range of those
missiles remain unsettled, he added.
   The issues are part of negotiations on a treaty to slash
long-range U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines
that Bush and Gorbachev would like to sign at their summit meeting
in Washington in June.

   Romania's embattled chief of
broadcasting said today he was resigning because of intensifying
``political conflicts'' over the freedom of state-run television.
   Opposition members have accused the revolutionary government of
using TV as a political weapon. It has been one of the key issues
as Romania prepares for its first free multiparty elections since
World War II.
   Broadcasting chief Aurel Dragos Munteanu said his goal had been
to promote freedom of information, and he worried that Romanians
had been so poisoned by the legacy of Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu that they looked for ``betrayal and hatred'' in every
word, even those spoken sincerely.
   On Jan. 29, Munteanu resigned as chief spokesman of the ruling
council of the National Salvation Front in response to criticism by
the opposition.
   But almost daily demonstrations outside broadcasting
headquarters since then also demanded his resignation as president
of Romanian Radio and Television, saying he was too tied to the
front, which had decided to contest the elections in May.
   Protesters demanded that the freedom won during December's
revolution which toppled Ceausescu be transferred to the TV screen.
   Munteanu's letter of resignation, published today on the front
page of major newspapers, drew bigger headlines than Friday's first
meeting of the new Council of National Unity which will run Romania
until elections.
   In what was billed as perhaps the first democratically made
decision in 40 years, the new Council of National Unity agreed to
expand from 180 to 259 members to provide a broad base for the new
interim government.
   The outgoing National Salvation Front agreed to the coalition
government after protests of its decision to field candidates in
the election. The front, which included many Communist Party
veterans, had ruled without opposition participation.
   The consensus to increase the new body's membership came after
more than four hours of debate at the former National Assembly
building.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu, who led the outgoing front's
ruling council, presided over the meeting. Election of the new
council president was apparently put off, with Iliescu a strong
favorite.
   ``This first meeting, which was quite heated, led to consensus
and a final list of council members,'' Iliescu said at the end of
the 7{-hour session.
   An earlier decision to increase the council to 241 members was
expanded to give even greater representation.
   The assembly building is being used for the first time since the
uprising against Ceausescu, who was overthrown Dec. 22 and executed
three days later. The council agreed to meet again Tuesday.
   The first four hours of debate Friday centered on whether nine
new parties registered in the last week should be given seats and
on questions regarding the seating of ethnic groups.
   In the expanded council, 114 seats went to 38 parties, 27 seats
to nine organizations representing ethnic minorities, three seats
will be filled by former political prisoners, and 114 seats go to
prominent Romanians from all walks of life who were part of the
National Salvation Front. The president is to fill the remaining
seat.
   Before Friday's session, the legality of the decree creating the
council was challenged by the National Peasants Party, which
opposed granting a large number of seats to former National Front
members. It later dropped its challenge.
   In another development, a colonel awaiting trial on charges of
complicity in genocide during the revolution committed suicide by
hanging himself with his belt in a jail cell in Timosoara, the
daily Romania Libera reported Friday.
   Before his suicide, Col. Petre Moraru told journalists of
details of a clandestine operation to transfer the bodies of people
killed in the first days of the revolt from Timisoara to Bucharest
to be cremated.
   Also Friday, Silviu Brucan, who resigned from the front
leadership last month, confirmed that some of Ceausescu's hated
Securitate secret police remained at large.

   Secessionist rebels in the northern
province of Eritrea have launched a major new offensive,
threatening government access to a vital port and food shipments to
millions of drought victims.
   The offensive, which the rebels said began Thursday along a
120-mile front, ended a nearly yearlong lull in fighting in the
region and plunged all four of Ethiopia's northern provinces back
into civil war.
   The government confirmed the new fighting Friday night, and a
government radio station in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, said
battles were raging today.
   In a statement, the Ethiopian government said the renewed
fighting ``has now dimmed the prospects of resolving the Eritrean
problem through the stalled peace talks'' and accused the rebels of
``using the peace talks as a subterfuge to prepare extensively for
this destructive war.''
   But a senior Eritrean official said today in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, that the rebels will meet Ethiopian government envoys in
the North Yemen capital of San'a on Feb. 15 in a new bid to resolve
their 28-year-old conflict.
   Saleh Ahmed Ayai, deputy chairman of the Eritrean Liberation
Front-Unified Organization, told The Associated Press the talks
were in response to a mediation effort by North Yemen's President,
Ali Abdullah Saleh.
   The meeting had earlier been tentatively set for Feb. 1, but it
was postponed when Saleh visited the United States.
   Former President Jimmy Carter sponsored similar peace talks
between another Eritrean faction, the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front, and the Addis Ababa government late last year in Atlanta and
in Nairobi, Kenya.
   The Eritreans' secessionist campaign is Africa's longest-running
conflict.
   The new offensive also has jeopardized plans by the United
Nations to provide food in the next few months for an estimated 4
million drought victims in northern Ethiopia, mostly in the
provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   The attack by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front came as the
government appeared to be containing another offensive farther
south by the Tigre People's Liberation Front, a separate insurgent
group.
   The government said the Eritrean rebels' main objective appeared
to be the capture of Massawa, the largest of only two ports on
Ethiopia's Red Sea coast. The other is at Asab, near the country's
border with Djibouti.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast, the rebels said they had taken
control of the road from Asmara to Massawa, 40 miles northeast of
the provincial capital, in what they described as ``a crushing
offensive.''
   ``The operation was very broad and and swift and the victory
very great,'' said the Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea. It
claimed rebel forces had scattered the government army deployed
along the road.
   The Eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence for
their province, once an Italian colony, since 1961 in what has
become Africa's oldest war.
   The Tigrean rebels, based in the province just south of Eritrea,
launched their own offensive in August, pushing government troops
out of their last remaining strongholds in Tigre and sweeping south
and east into the provinces of Wollo and Gondor.
   The government declared a mass mobilization in September. In a
counteroffensive in January, it recaptured some of the towns and
garrisons taken earlier by the Tigrean insurgents.
   Although their aims are different, the Eritrean and Tigrean
rebels have coordinated attacks against the government in the past.
   The Tigreans, unlike the Eritreans, seek the complete overthrow
of the Marxist regime of President Mengistu Haile Marian and its
replacement with what they describe as a government modeled after
that of Albania, the last hard-line communist government in Eastern
Europe.

   Rival Christian forces clashed with
artillery and machine guns today in violation of a cease-fire in
their 12-day-old power struggle. Frightened rescuers left corpses
to rot in Beirut's streets.
   By police count, at least 433 people have been killed and 1,684
wounded, most of them civilians, since the battle for leadership of
an estimated 1 million Christians broke out Jan. 30. The fighters
have not given rescuers guarantees to remove bodies that have been
in the streets for days.
   Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and the Lebanese Forces militia,
commanded by Samir Geagea, appeared to be gearing up for more
savage attacks.
   An anti-Aoun Christian radio station reported a mutiny among his
19,000 troops, one week after 1,000 soldiers defected to the
Lebanese Forces or to a Moslem commander in west Beirut. Today's
report could not be immediately verified.
   The two sides clashed during the night and early morning with
machine guns in several districts of Christian east Beirut. Snipers
dueled constantly. Three people were killed and four wounded during
heavy shelling, police said.
   ``The situation does not indicate that the cease-fire's going to
hold,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be identified under
standing regulations.
   Aoun's gunners bombarded a militia unit that blew up the Daraya
bridge northeast of Beirut.
   Geagea's gunners responded with heavy shelling to cover the
unit's withdrawal, the police spokesman said.
   He said Geagea's artillery also shelled Aoun's howitzer
emplacements in the Bekfaya region north of Beirut.
   Geagea's headquarters said in a communique that Aoun's artillery
was shelling ``population centers'' in northern Kesrouan province.
   This month's fighting has been the bloodiest between Christian
forces since Lebanon's civil war began in 1975.
   The police spokesman said several decomposing corpses remained
in streets that form a no-man's land between Geagea's men and
Aoun's troops in east Beirut.
   ``Civil defense teams haven't been able to obtain guarantees
from both sides that they won't shoot at them while evacuating the
corpses,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Civil defense officials believe some of the corpses are
booby-trapped, and that's why the combatants want to keep them
there,'' he added.
   The police spokesman reported no progress in efforts to put into
effect a truce worked out Friday by representatives of both sides.
   Aoun has accused Geagea of trying to enforce an Arab
League-brokered peace plan to end the nation's civil war. The
October accord, worked out by Lebanese legislators in Saudi Arabia,
led to the formation of a government under President Elias Hrawi,
also a Christian.
   Aoun attacked the pact because it set no date for withdrawal of
the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon. Aoun, who was appointed last
year to head an interim cabinet, has refused to acknowledge Hrawi's
government or obey his orders to quit his army post.
   The Syrian soldiers, who control most of the country, were
deployed in Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to quell
fighting between Moslems and Christians.
   However, Aoun says they violated their peacekeeping mandate by
siding with the Moslems.

   Hundreds of white extremists, some
screaming ``Hang Mandela!'' staged a boisterous demonstration today
against government race reforms and demanded a return to strict
apartheid.
   In Johannesburg, police used tear gas and batons to disperse
about 100 people protesting the presence of a boycott-breaking
English cricket team.
   About 500 members of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement,
many in khaki uniforms and armed with truncheons, gathered in
downtown Pretoria to march on government buildings.
   The organization, led by the charismatic Eugene TerreBlanche,
favors a strengthening of segregation laws, opposes the
government's decision to free black leader Nelson Mandela, and
views President F.W. de Klerk's reforms as capitulation to the
black majority.
   The movement, which seeks a whites-only homeland, has threatened
to take up arms against the government if white privilege is
threatened.
   Before the march began, some members of the movement began
shouting ``Hang Mandela!''
   De Klerk on Friday warned that conservative whites who have
criticized the concessions could ignite a racial war in South
Africa.
   De Klerk has promised to release Mandela, the country's best
known black leader. Mandela, 71, has been imprisoned since 1962 for
helping to plan the start of the African National Congress'
sabotage campaign.
   A lawyer for Mandela's family said Mandela could be released
today.
   Outside Wanderers cricket stadium in Johannesburg, police
dispersed about 100 demonstrators protesting the rebel cricket tour.
   Although a magistrate had banned any marches to the stadium, the
protesters were allowed to make their way several blocks through a
residential neighborhood to Wanderers. Some white spectators in the
stadium jeered at the protesters, and a few threw beer at them.
   As the protesters began to march away from the stadium, police
ordered the crowd to disperse. After a few moments, police charged
into the marchers, spraying tear gas and hitting people with batons.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of workers and
volunteers sopped up oily goo tarnishing miles of scenic beaches
and boats skimmed crude from the water as the expanding slick from
a ruptured tanker drifted northward.
   The cleanup effort Friday seemed no match for the spill of up to
300,000 gallons from the 811-foot American Trader. Methods to soak
up the slippery, viscous goo were inefficient, some said.
   ``This is a small oil spill,'' said filmmaker Jean-Michel
Cousteau, son of renowned oceanographer Jacques Cousteau. ``We
don't know how to pick it up. We do not have the technology. We are
not prepared.''
   The midweek spill from the British Petroleum-operated tanker
left oily globules along 18 miles of coastline, from Seal Beach to
Newport Beach, where a dark brown tide marred the city's beaches.
Officials there declared a state of emergency.
   By morning, southerly winds had blown the oil slick northward
over two more miles of ocean, lengthening it to 12 miles long.
``Medium concentrations'' of frothy, wind-whipped oil washed ashore
along three miles of Huntington Beach, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Dennis Hall.
   Winds turned offshore by sunrise, sending fingers of the slick
reaching westward, expanding its width to 3{ miles, according to
updated overflight charts.
   Hall said the slick reached northward to the Long Beach
breakwater near Anaheim Bay, he said. Long Beach is a major ocean
port adjacent to Los Angeles Harbor, another heavily traveled sea
port. A long breakwater protects both.
   Meanwhile, Los Angeles harbor pilots struck today to protest
what they called unsafe working conditions caused by fatigue and
untrained pilots. Those pilots were not involved in the spill to
the south in Huntington Beach.
   Two management pilot supervisors planned to steer four of nine
scheduled tankers into port today but the ships would have to wait
at offshore anchorages because dock workers honored the pilots
strike, the Coast Guard said.
   Several hundred workers hired by the oil shipper and an equal
number of volunteers worked around the clock to soak up the goo at
Newport Beach. They filled hundreds of trash bags with towels,
fouled sand and oil.
   ``Are we out of the woods? No, not yet,'' said Charles Webster,
crisis manager for British Petroleum. ``But we're working to stay
ahead of the curve.''
   Workers in yellow waterproof gear combed the muck overnight near
the Huntington Beach Pier with a backhoe, blotted oil with
absorbent pads and dragged blue plastic pompons across the beach to
soaked up oily pools.
   Residents scoured the sand with brooms and dust pans and carried
oil-soaked sea birds to an emergency station. But cleanup
officials, worried about chemical hazards and liability, urged them
to leave the job to hired crews.
   British Petroleum said 390 cleanup workers were cleaning a
20-mile coastal stretch from Bolsa Chica to Laguna Beach. Nine
skimmers were at work on the slick a mile offshore and others were
en route.
   Fifty-four oil-soaked birds, including 11 dead, were reported
Friday by Susan Rimerman, spokeswoman for International Bird Rescue
and Research, a group hired by the state Fish and Game department.
Department biologist John Grant said 12 birds had died.
   There were no reports of oil entering the wildlife habitats of
the Bolsa Chica Wetlands, the Santa Ana River mouth and upper
Newport Bay, where booms blocked their entrances.
   But there was concern the slick might drift south to Laguna
Beach, the scenic art colony fronted by rocky tide pools teeming
with marine life. Webster said a cleanup company was placed on call
there.
   The Coast Guard pumped out 1 million gallons of oil still inside
the forward hold of the tanker. Officials said the American Trader,
which carried 21 million gallons of crude, may have been gashed by
its own anchor on Wednesday as it tried to moor near a pipeline.
   Cousteau, who flew over the slick early Friday, said the
skimming equipment aboard the boats was not working.
   ``You look at skimmers. Everybody is working very hard,''
Cousteau said. ``It goes right under the boom. ... I mean I filmed
it there. We are not being efficient and we do not have the
technology to be efficient.''
   John Turner, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
said good weather had kept the slick offshore and available
resources had helped cleanup efforts.
   ``To date we've been lucky,'' Turner said. But he warned that
``there's a lot of oil that could come ashore.''
   He said chemical dispersants would not be used due to the
slick's proximity to shore and the potential danger of toxicity to
animals. Fines and penalties were under consideration because of
the dead and injured birds, he said.

   Nelson Mandela, given a life
sentence for plotting to overthrow the South African government,
became the world's most influential prisoner during what he
described as ``long, lonely, wasted years.''
   Mandela was unheard and unseen by the public since 1962, but
nevertheless he came to be the most admired leader among South
African blacks, who consider him the embodiment of their quest for
political freedom.
   He rejected the government's repeated offers to release him if
he would renounce violence or live in a tribal homeland. He said
the government should renounce violence, end apartheid and lift the
ban on his movement _ the African National Congress.
   President F.W. de Klerk legalized the ANC and 60 other
organizations on Feb. 2, and announced Mandela would be freed soon,
although apartheid and restrictive security laws remained in place.
In the meantime, Mandela had met regularly with government
officials during the past year and issued statements saying he
wanted to work for peace.
   Today, de Klerk announced that Mandela, 71, would be released
unconditionally Sunday.
   After his historic meeting on July 5, 1989 with President P.W.
Botha, a statement by Mandela was released by the Prisons Service
and broadcast on government-run radio and television.
   He said he had not deviated ``from the position I have taken
over the past 28 years, namely that dialogue with the mass
democratic movement and, in particular, with the African National
Congress, is the only way of ending violence and bringing peace to
our country.
   ``I only would like to contribute to the creation of a climate
which would promote peace in South Africa,'' Mandela said.
   De Klerk replaced Botha in August 1989, and met with Mandela at
his Cape Town office on Dec. 13, 1989 amid intense expectations
that the prisoner would be freed in the new year.
   Mandela regularly entertained his family and streams of friends
in a comfortable house at the Victor Verster prison farm in the
wine-growing region of Paarl. He had been transferred there on Dec.
6, 1988 after recovering from tuberculosis contracted at Pollsmoor
Prison in Cape Town in August.
   Expectations of his release had been raised before, but each
time the government balked at freeing the man many blacks believed
should be their president.
   Former Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said in July
1988 that Mandela had served enough time to pay for his crimes and
that the only thing keeping him in prison was the government's
uncertainty about the effect he would have on politics and national
security.
   It was a tacit admission of what Botha had denied for years _
that Mandela was a political prisoner.
   In 1985, Botha allowed Zindzi Mandela to read her father's
response to the latest offer of conditional release before a crowd
in Soweto, the township outside Johannesburg where Mandela had
rented a home since the 1940s.
   ``Only free men can negotiate. Prisoners cannot enter into
contracts,'' Mandela said. ``I cherish my own freedom dearly but I
care even more for your freedom. Too many have died since I went to
prison. Too many have suffered for the love of freedom. Not only I
have suffered during these long, lonely, wasted years.''
   During his imprisonment Mandela was regarded as the leader of
the African National Congress, although the highest office he held
before it was banned in 1960 was deputy president-general.
   He was the first commander of its military wing, ``Spear of the
Nation,'' which he helped form in 1961 to engage in a program of
sabotage.
   He subsequently toured Africa, receiving military training and
explaining the ANC's cause. He was arrested after his return, in
1962, and sentenced to five years' hard labor for leaving the
country illegally and inciting blacks to violate the law by
striking.
   Mandela told the court that when his sentence was ended he would
``take up again, as best I can, the struggle for the removal of
those injustices until they are finally abolished once and for
all.''
   ``I have no doubt that posterity will pronounce that I was
innocent, and that the criminals that should have been brought
before this court are the members of the ... government,'' he said.
   In July 1963, while Mandela was at the Robben Island
maximum-security prison near Cape Town, police uncovered the ANC's
underground headquarters on a farm near Johannesburg and seized
documents outlining plans for the guerrilla campaign, including
Mandela's diary. In June 1964, he and seven co-defendants were
sentenced to life in prison.
   ``I do not deny that I planned sabotage,'' he said in his
statement from the dock. ``I did not plan it in a spirit of
recklessness, nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it
as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political
situation that had arisen after years of tyranny, exploitation and
oppression of my people by whites.''
   He said he ``cherished the ideal of a democratic and free
society in which all persons live together in harmony and with
equal opportunities. ... It is an ideal which I hope to live for
and achieve, but if need be an ideal for which I am prepared to
die.''
   His wife, Winnie, jailed or banished through much of his
imprisonment, said, ``In each and every single letter he has
written over the past 20 years and in each and every visit, he has
always been confident that he will come out and lead his people to
liberation.''

   During most of his 18 years on Robben Island, Mandela endured
substandard food, deprivation of news and reading material, and
hard labor that included gathering seaweed and smashing rock. Yet
he often wrote his wife that the hardest thing to endure was the
treatment she received.
   He wrote that he sometimes wondered ``whether any kind of
commitment can ever be sufficient excuse for abandoning a young and
inexperienced woman in a pitiless desert.''
   In April 1982, Mandela and five colleagues were transferred to
Pollsmoor Prison in a white suburb outside Cape Town. They shared a
large cell where Mandela cultivated a vegetable garden and
complained about the conditions. He was allowed to pursue his
studies for an advanced law degree, which he received in early
1989, and eventually began receiving uncensored newspapers and
radio reports.
   Mandela's communications with his wife and family were
restricted to 40-minute visits and one 500-word letter per month,
monitored to make sure only family matters were discussed. On May
12, 1984, Mandela and his wife were allowed to embrace for the
first time in 22 years.
   Mandela was born July 18, 1918, the son of a tribal chief, and
received a relatively privileged upbringing in Transkei, a Xhosa
homeland the government has declared an independent republic. He
attended Methodist schools and was admitted to the black University
of Fort Hare in 1938, but was expelled in 1940 for leading a
student strike with Oliver Tambo, now the ANC's exiled president.
   To avoid an arranged tribal marriage, Mandela fled to
Johannesburg, where he worked as a policeman at a gold mine, as a
law clerk, and for a real estate agency run by Walter Sisulu, later
to be imprisoned with him. Mandela boxed as a heavyweight and
studied law at the predominantly white University of the
Witwatersrand.
   He married a nurse, Evelyn Mase, who bore him two daughters and
two sons. One daughter died in infancy and one son was killed in a
car crash in 1970. The couple divorced in 1957.
   Mandela, Tambo and Sisulu formed the ANC Youth League in 1944,
and Mandela became its president in 1950. He was chief organizer of
the ANC's Defiance Campaign in 1952, encouraging people to break
South Africa's racial separation laws.
   He and Tambo formed the first black law partnership in the
country and were charged in December 1952 under the Suppression of
Communism Act for their part in the civil disobedience campaign. He
received the first of many banning orders, restricting his
activities.
   He continued to work secretly and was charged in December 1956
with treason, along with 155 other South Africans of all races who
had supported the Freedom Charter, calling for a non-racial
democracy and a socialist-based economy.
   While on trial, he married social worker Winnie Nomzamo
Madizekela, who bore him two daughters, Zenani and Zindzi.
   He helped conduct the defense in the treason trial, which ended
in 1960 with acquittals for all defendants. Mandela immediately
went underground for fear he would be rearrested and spent the next
17 months as a fugitive.
   After a planned two-day nationwide strike was crushed by police,
he and a small group of ANC colleagues decided on military action.
   ``All opportunities for peaceful agitation and struggle have
been closed to us,'' he said. ``Africans no longer have the freedom
to even stay peacefully in their houses in protest against the
oppressive policies of the government.''

<HEAD>After a Year Under Death Threat, Salman Rushdie Fights Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after he was driven into hiding by an
Islamic death sentence, Salman Rushdie has begun to fight back.
   With a long interview and an essay in a Sunday newspaper, plus a
lecture written from hiding, the 42-year-old author is mounting a
vigorous, unapologetic defense of ``The Satanic Verses'' and shows
no inclination to bow to pressure to back down.
   That pressure is manifesting itself in a heated debate about
whether ``The Satanic Verses'' should be published in paperback.
Yes, says Rushdie. No, say those who fear it will lead to Moslem
unrest.
   The opponents include lawmakers, writers and relatives of
British hostages in Lebanon. Free speech has its limits, they say,
and a paperback edition would only worsen a conflict that has
already damaged Anglo-Moslem relations and led to deadly rioting.
   Some of Rushdie's supporters worry that the furor that greeted
the death sentence imposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran
last Feb. 14 is dissipating.
   ``There has been this gradual shift ... into considering Rushdie
as a criminal, from someone to be supported, here's someone who
caused disquiet, unrest,'' said Frances D'Souza, head of the
International Committee for the Defense of Salman Rushdie and his
Publishers.
   The issue has domestic political implications too. The
opposition Labor Party, which Rushdie always supported, is torn
between the principle of free speech and the fear of losing Moslem
votes.
   Rushdie acknowledges his book has caused pain but appeals to
moderate Moslems to reconsider their campaign. The Bombay-born
Briton says he renounced Islam in his youth, and therefore cannot
be accused of blasphemy or reneging on his faith.
   If the uproar represents the conflict between Islamic
fundamentalism and Western libertarianism, Rushdie is firmly on the
side of the West.
   His lecture at the Institute of Contemporary Art, delivered by
playwright Harold Pinter and attended by a host of literary
heavyweights, cited an array of writers through the ages to defend
free speech and decry religious absolutism.
   ``The True Believer knows that he is simply right, and you are
wrong. He will seek to convert you, even by force (or)... despise
you for your unbelief,'' he wrote.
   Within days of the publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' in
September 1988, Moslems were claiming it insulted the Prophet
Mohammed by associating him with prostitutes, and the Koran, their
holy book, by suggesting it was man's work, not Allah's.
   The worldwide protests and book-burnings, and the deadly riots
in Pakistan and India, culminated in Iran promising a
multimillion-dollar reward for anyone who killed Rushdie. Khomeini
died in June, but the edict stands.
   Rushdie was at his north London home last Valentine's Day, when
the British Broadcasting Corp. told him of Khomeini's edict. The
same day, Rushdie dropped out of sight with his wife, American
novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   Since then he has been under round-the-clock armed guard at a
series of houses operated by Special Branch security police and
MI5, the domestic intelligence agency.
   Ms. Wiggins moved out in August. She denies there were marital
difficulties. Rushdie confined himself to publishing occasional
book reviews but stayed out of the debate on his book, saying he
felt his silence would be more eloquent.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English, almost three-quarters of those in the United States, and
has been on the Sunday Times of London bestseller list for 49 weeks.
   It has been translated into 15 other languages and been banned
in more than 20 countries.
   Writers and commentators initially rallied to Rushdie's defense,
with 2,500 worldwide signing a petition.
   But in recent weeks, spy writer John le Carre and liberal
political columnist Hugo Young have openly pressed Rushdie to
abandon the paperback edition.
   Rushdie maintains the paperback is essential if his book is to
last for posterity.
   Without a paperback, ``in a few years the book simply won't be
there for anyone who wants to read it,'' he told The Independent on
Sunday. ``It will, in all practical terms, have been suppressed.''
   But writing in the left-leaning Guardian newspaper, le Carre
said, ``Nobody has a God-given right to insult a great religion and
be published with impunity.''
   Young, a Guardian columnist, urged Rushdie to renounce the
paperback ``on the deeply considered grounds that it could do more
harm than good.''
   Relatives of British hostages issued a statement saying
paperback publication would be ``misconceived and irresponsible''
and could make conditions worse for the captives, believed held by
Moslem extremists.
   Viking Penguin says ``no firm date'' has been set for paperback
publication. The publishers have reason to be evasive. Khomeini's
death sentence extended to them too, and they have received 35,000
abusive or threatening letters and 45 bomb threats in Britain and
the United States, says spokesman Bob Gregory.
   The company's British headquarters have been evacuated six
times, and five incendiary devices have been found in its stores,
two of which exploded. Worldwide security measures cost $3.4
million a year, Gregory said.
   In a 7,000-word essay for The Independent on Sunday, Rushdie
touched on his lonely existence and the shock of being condemned by
Moslems for what he thought was a sympathetic account of their
plight as immigrants in the West.
   ``Do I feel regret? Of course I do: regret that such offense has
been taken against my work when it was not intended ...,'' Rushdie
wrote.
   ``Would I have written it differently If I had known what would
happen? Truthfully, I don't know. Would I change any of the text
now? I would not. It's too late.''

   Watching American football on TV, telephoning
friends, and writing a children's book are among the simple
pleasures author Salman Rushdie is permitted in his seclusion.
   Browsing through bookstores, strolling down the street and going
to movies are forbidden by the armed government guards who move him
from one safe house to another to protect him from a year-old
Iranian death sentence.
   Rushdie's whereabouts is unknown, even to his wife, American
author Marianne Wiggins, who moved out in August. She says there
are no marital problems and that she corresponds with husband each
night.
   After months of virtual silence, Rushdie and his wife have been
telling a few trusted interviewers something about their year.
   ``The things that are most difficult to take are not being able
to walk down a street, not being able to browse in a bookshop, not
being able to go to a movie _ those trivial sorts of things that
you take for granted until you don't have them. What they add up to
is life,'' Rushdie told The Independent on Sunday in an interview
behind drawn curtains at a restaurant.
   His reading matter includes ``Moby Dick,'' ``Ulysses,'' and the
great free-speech defenders of the 18th Century Enlightenment,
Rousseau, Diderot and Voltaire.
   He watches ``Dallas,'' ``Dynasty,'' and ``thirtysomething,'' and
confesses a new addiction to American football, a recent addition
to British TV.
   Rushdie told the newspaper that at times he could not work, but
now his writing is ``going well.'' He is finishing a children's
book, is putting together a collection of essays and has completed
the synopsis for a novel.

<TEXT>
   During his year in hiding, author Salman Rushdie
has published a poem, several book reviews and a 7,000-word essay
defending his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Here are some of the
things he has said:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``I recognize that Moslems in many parts of the world are
genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I profoundly
regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere
followers of Islam. Living as we do in a world of many faiths, this
experience has served to remind us that we must all be conscious of
the sensibilities of others.'' (Feb. 18, 1989, four days after the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini imposed the death sentence).
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``I do not accept the charge of blasphemy, because as somebody
says in ``The Satanic Verses,'' ``where there is no belief, there
is no blasphemy''... I am not a Moslem. It feels bizarre and wholly
inappropriate to be described as some sort of heretic after having
lived my life as a secular, pluralist, eclectic man.'' (Feb. 4,
1990, essay in The Independent on Sunday).
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The things that are most difficult to take are not being able
to walk down a street, not being able to browse in a bookshop, not
being able to go to a movie _ those trivial sorts of things that
you take for granted until you don't have them. What they add up to
is life.'' (Feb. 4, 1990, interview in The Independent on Sunday).
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``It has always been a shock to me to meet people for whom books
simply do not matter, and people who are scornful of the act of
reading, let alone writing. It is perhaps always astonishing to
learn that your beloved is not as attractive to others as she is to
you.'' (Feb. 6, Herbert Read Memorial Lecture).

<HEAD>Release `Significant Step,' Bush Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Mandela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush welcomed the announcement today
that black activist Nelson Mandela will be freed, praising South
African President F.W. de Klerk for ``bold and imaginative
leadership.''
   ``I welcome this move and view it as another significant step on
the road to the non-racial, democratic South Africa which we all
desire,'' Bush said in a statement released from Camp David, Md.,
where he is spending the weekend at the presidential retreat.
   Bush reiterated his intention to invite Mandela and de Klerk to
the White House in separate visits. Some critics on Capitol Hill
have said de Klerk should not be welcomed as long as his nation
retains its system of racial separation known as apartheid.
   ``President de Klerk has shown bold and imaginative leadership
in recent days which has earned the admiration of many of us who
hope for swift and peaceful evolution in South Africa,'' Bush said.
   He made no mention of whether the release of Mandela after years
as a political prisoner would cause the administration to push for
easing of U.S. sanctions against Pretoria.

<TEXT>
   To John O'Donnell, the allegations of sexual
misconduct against the Rev. Bruce Ritter are beside the point. The
point, he says, is that Covenant House gives him a clean place to
sleep each night.
   ``He feeds us, he clothes us and we're behind him 100 percent,''
said O'Donnell, 20, who found shelter at Covenant House two weeks
ago after he and his mother were evicted. ``He's the nicest guy in
the world, and I ain't even met him. But someday I will and I'm
going to shake his hand.''
   The day before, Ritter had stepped down as executive director of
Covenant House pending an investigation by the Franciscans, the
order of Roman Catholic priests to which Ritter belongs, of charges
that he had had sexual relations with several youths who had sought
his help.
   Ritter dismisses the allegations as ``garbage,'' and O'Donnell
and many of his fellow Covenant House residents agree. Even those
who think Ritter's accusers could be telling the truth say it
doesn't diminish their gratitude for a man whose work changed their
lives.
   ``Excuse my language, but regardless if he's a homosexual or
not, he's doing the right thing for us,'' said Mitchell Dedes, 20,
as he stood outside the Covenant House shelter a few blocks from
Times Square and a block from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Both
are magnets for homeless youths.
   ``We get three meals a day,'' he said. ``My clothes have been
washed clean. I was out on the streets about four weeks after I
lost my job. Now I sleep in a room with a bed, where the sheets get
changed.''
   Covenant House began in 1968, when Ritter, now 62, put a few
runaways up in his apartment. It now serves 25,000 youths annually
at 17 shelters in the United States, Canada and Latin America.
   Nearly all of its $85 million-a-year budget is funded by private
donations. In his letters to potential donors, Ritter details the
lives of youths who leave abusive homes for a street life of drugs
and prostitution, but finally find peace at Covenant House.
   Since the controversy began, contributions are said to have
fallen off, as Ritter _ a man who is accustomed to laudatory
coverage, who was celebrated by President Reagan as a hero _ makes
headlines of a different sort.
   The charges against Ritter first arose in December, when the New
York Post quoted a onetime male prostitute as saying he had had an
affair with Ritter over several months last year. The young man's
father defended Ritter, calling his son an emotionally troubled
liar.
   Then, in January, the Village Voice, a New York weekly
newspaper, said a second young man had claimed during a 1986
interview that he had had sex with Ritter. The interview was not
published at that time. Last week, two other young men were quoted
in published reports as saying they had had affairs with Ritter.
   On Tuesday, the Franciscans said they had instructed Ritter to
step down temporarily from the Covenant House post while the
allegations were investigated. And the Manhattan district
attorney's office is investigating whether Covenant House funds
were misused.
   ``I think the media has tried to exploit the negative,'' said
Reginald Lewis, 22, who ran away from his Oakland, Calif., home at
age 17 and spent nine months at Covenant House before recently
getting a place of his own and a job as a computer operator.
   The accusations against Ritter, he added, are ``unimportant. The
philosophy behind what Father Ritter has done is what's important.''
   ``Why don't they talk about the good things he's done?''
complained Nina Spear, 19, who came to Covenant House 2{ months ago
after living on the street for 2{ years. She left her home on
Staten Island because, she said, her ``life was messed up _ drugs,
family.''
   At Covenant House, she said, ``They teach us discipline,
self-respect, respect for others. Instead of sleeping on the
subway, you sleep in a bed.''
   Andrew Escalet, 21, who has been at Covenant House for more than
a year and hopes to be on his own by May, said: ``I don't feel any
disappointment. I feel it's irrelevant. There's people that do so
much worse in this world.''
   Escalet's family kicked him out of his house in the Bronx two
years ago. ``I stayed with friends,'' he recalled. ``Several times
I stayed out in the parks and slept in a box. Got to a time when I
needed some sort of rescue. It wasn't nobody else but Covenant
House.''
   Escalet, now working for a piano-moving company and studying for
his high-school diploma, said when he talks to Ritter about his
problems, the priest ``exhibits a tremendous amount of
understanding, caring. That's important. If he can have that much
understanding for me, I can have that for him.''
   With the voice of experience, he added: ``It only takes one time
for you to mess up, but it takes many, many good things for them to
realize you're good.''

<HEAD>Congress Tilted to Right in 1989, Liberal Group Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress edged rightward in 1989 despite
``flashes of courage'' on abortion, flag burning and capital gains
taxes, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action says.
   A compilation of voting records on 20 key issues by the ADA
showed an average 50 percent approval of the liberal position in
the House, down from 52 percent in 1988, and a decline from 52
percent to 48 percent of liberal causes in the Senate.
   The organization's national director, Amy Issacs, said liberals
``rarely had the votes to pass even moderate legislation over
President Bush's 10 `kinder, gentler' vetoes.'' In fact it passed
none.
   ``The first session of the 101st Congress was often spent in
wrangling, often ugly debate, on issues that had little to do with
its real business _ passing laws,'' Ms. Issacs said. ``While all
this made for wonderful newspaper copy, it did little to address
the nation's business.''
   With 100 percent ``right'' votes on the 20 issues, the group
hailed Sens. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, as
its ``liberal champions'' in the Senate.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., who has enjoyed perfect pro-liberal
ADA ratings since 1982, led a contingency of 25 House members with
a 100 percent liberal voting records last year, as compiled by the
ADA and released this week. All 25 are Democrats.
   Nine Senate Republicans and 39 GOP members in the House scored
zero ratings.
   House Democrats had an average 73 percent pro-liberal voting
record compared with 70 percent for their party colleagues in the
Senate. Republicans compiled 15 percent right votes in both the
House and Senate.
   Democratic party leaders were more liberal _ 93 percent in the
House and 75 percent in the Senate _ than members of their party as
a whole. GOP leaders were more conservative, with average rankings
of 5 percent in the House and 8 percent in the Senate.
   House Democratic committee chairman were slightly more liberal _
77 percent _ than their party colleagues. However, Senate
Democratic committee chairmen were slightly more conservative with
an average 66 percent rating.
   But ranking committee Republicans in both the House and Senate
had much more liberal voting records _ a 22 percent average _ than
the party's leaders and its members in Congress as a lot.
   Lawmakers from Massachusetts had the most liberal ratings,
averaging 89 percent, followed by those from North Dakota at 80
percent; Connecticut, 74 percent; West Virginia, 73 percent; and
Hawaii, 69 percent.
   State delegations with the lowest average liberal voting records
were Wyoming at 5 percent, followed by Idaho, 11 percent; Alaska,
13 percent; New Hampshire; 15 percent; and Utah, 18 percent.

   Here is the list of ratings of the voting
records of House members in 1989 as compiled by the liberal group,
Americans for Democratic Action. A rating of 100 means a lawmaker
voted the ADA position on 100 percent of the 20 key votes the
organization selected for its tally. An X indicates the member did
not vote enough times to be rated.

<HEAD>Eight Bombs Explode in Kashmir Capital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight bombs exploded in Srinagar on
Saturday, and Moslem separatists urged city residents to
demonstrate in the streets to mark the sixth anniversary of the
execution of a militant leader.
   Police increased security and said Srinagar would be under
curfew throughout Sunday, the anniversary of Mohammad Maqbool
Butt's death.
   Butt, the founder of the militant Jammu-Kashmir Liberation
Front, was hanged in New Delhi's Tihar Jail on Feb. 11, 1984, for
the 1965 murder of an intelligence agent in Kashmir.
   Butt was convicted in 1967, but he escaped from a Srinagar jail
in 1968. He was rearrested in 1979 and remained in jail until his
execution.
   The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front is spearheading a violent
campaign for secession of the Himalayan state of Jammu-Kashmir, the
country's only Moslem majority state, from the predominantly Hindu
India.
   The movement is centered in Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state and its largest city. Jammu region, south of
Kashmir, is Hindu dominated.
   At least 82 people have died in the latest round of secessionist
violence that flared Jan. 20 when Moslem militants took to the
streets and clashed with security forces. Most victims were
protesters shot for defying curfew.
   Curfew had been restricted to night hours since Jan. 26 because
authorities said the situation had stabilized. But it was clamped
on the city at 11 a.m. Saturday after the bomb blasts.
   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
blasts occurred outside two banks, a post office and other shops
and businesses. They said no one was injured.
   No one claimed responsibility, but the officials blamed the
separatists.
   Curfew was strictly enforced and streets remained deserted.
Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
wall posters that exhorted people to mark Butt's execution were
being removed.
   Some of the posters said: ``Come out and demonstrate in memory
of martyr Maqbool Butt who laid down his life for the cause of
liberation of Kashmir.''
   Witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said dozens of
army trucks carrying soldiers rolled into Srinagar late Friday,
apparently to counter possible violence Sunday.
   The city of 1 million was virtually sealed.
   Troops with machine guns patrolled the outskirts. All vehicles
entering the city were stopped and searched. All travelers were
told to leave vehicles and stood in lines with their hands raised
to be searched.
   ``We are on full alert and we will stand no nonsense,'' said
Major P. Govindaswamy, in charge of the army checkpoint at
Panbazar, five miles south of Srinagar.
   The army has been used often to control the violence in Kashmir,
a strategic region bordering Pakistan.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the Kashmiri
militants. Pakistan denies the charge and says the Kashmiris have
the right to self-determination. The countries have fought two wars
over Kashmir.
   Pakistan's prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, appeared to issue a
veiled threat Saturday in a speech to Parliament about the Kashmir
situation.
   ``We want a peaceful solution, but at the same time Pakistan
cannot be intimidated,'' Ms. Bhutto told Pakistani lawmakers. ``We
know how to defend our freedom and independence,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto accused India of blaming Pakistan for the violence
``in an attempt to externalize and divert the issue.''
   Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the two
countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial
rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley
became part of Jammu-Kashmir.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, the symbol of
unyielding black resistance to apartheid, will go free Sunday after
more than 27 years in prison, President F.W. de Klerk announced
today.
   ``Tomorrow will bring us to the end of a long chapter,'' de
Klerk told a news conference. He said he conferred with Mandela on
Friday night and was convinced the black leader is committed to a
peaceful resolution of the racial conflict that has plagued South
Africa for decades.
   The president also said the 3{-year-old state of emergency would
be lifted in a few weeks if no unrest accompanies Mandela's
release, and he pledged to negotiate the possible release of
remaining political prisoners.
   Mandela, in recent talks with the government, had demanded
freedom for all political prisoners and an end to the emergency,
which still allows police to detain suspects for up to six months
without charge, ban protests, and bar journalists and the general
public from protests and areas of unrest.
   The release of the world's best-known political prisoner has
long been viewed as the crucial step needed to end South Africa's
political stalemate and clear the way for negotiations on power
sharing between blacks and whites after decades of racial conflict.
   ``There can no longer be any doubt about the government's
sincerity in seeking to create a just dispensation based on
negotiations,'' de Klerk said.
   ``The eyes of the world are presently focused on all South
Africans. All of us now have an opportunity and the responsibility
to prove that we are capable of a peaceful process of creating a
new South Africa.''
   De Klerk, who stunned South Africans on Feb. 2 by lifting a
30-year ban on Mandela's African National Congress, said the
71-year-old black leader would be freed unconditionally at 3 p.m.
Sunday (8 a.m. EST) at the gates of Victor Verster prison farm
outside Cape Town.
   In Lusaka, Zambia, the ANC's headquarters-in-exile, the news was
greeted with jubiliation. ``I can hardly believe it,'' said ANC
executive committee member James Stuart. ``It's a great victory for
our people.''
   De Klerk said, ``I hope that now that this chapter has ended,
the world and more especially the people of South Africa will grasp
the opportunity and play whatever supportive role can be played
toward a peaceful conclusion.''
   The government has expressed fears about Mandela's safety in
light of reported death threats from right- and left-wing
extremists. De Klerk said the matter of security was being
discussed with Mandela's colleagues, but added: ``When he is
released he becomes a free man. He doesn't owe it to me to inform
us about his program.''
   Asked whether Mandela's release, along with the earlier
concessions, would bring about an end to Western sanctions against
South Africa, de Klerk replied: ``We are not working against
checklists. We are doing what we believe is in the best interests
of South Africa.''
   He said his discussion with the black leader had been amicable
and described him as dignified.
   Mandela's wide, Winnie, was at the family home in the black
township of Soweto outside Johannesburg and made no immediate
statement.
   ``These are incredible days in which we are living,'' said
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a major anti-apartheid leader. ABC News
showed the ecstatic Tutu at his home near Soweto with other Mandela
supporters, jumping up and down, dancing and singing after news of
the release was announced.
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for helping plan the start of the ANC's guerrilla
campaign. Many South African blacks consider him their paramount
leader, and he would be a favorite to win the presidency if blacks
could vote.
   De Klerk, in his historic speech Feb. 2, lifted bans and
restrictions on dozens of opposition groups, scrapped some
state-of-emergency regulations, declared a moratorium on hangings,
and said the government would free Mandela unconditionally as soon
as possible.
   However, he made no mention of dismantling apartheid, the system
of racial discrimination under which the 28-million member black
majority is denied a say in national affairs by the 5-million
member white minority.
   De Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, had offered to free Mandela
in exchange for a public renunciation of violence. Mandela refused,
saying the burden was on the government to legalize the ANC, scrap
segregation laws and agree to political negotiations.
   De Klerk, who succeeded Botha in August, has proposed
negotiations with black leaders on a new constitution that would
extend political rights to the disenfranchised black majority.
   Mandela, quartered at a comfortable house at Victor Verster, has
been meeting regularly with a wide range of government officials
and anti-apartheid activists in recent months.
   The government has indicated it would accept his offer to serve
as mediator if talks with the ANC take place.
   Concessions announced by de Klerk in his speech met most of the
ANC's conditions for negotiations. The organization says de Klerk
still must lift the state of emergency and free all political
prisoners, including those convicted of violent acts.
   In his speech, de Klerk lifted long-term bans on the South
African Communist Party and on the Pan Africanist Congress, a
guerrilla movement smaller than the ANC and less open to a role for
whites in the liberation struggle.
   A senior Pan Africanist leader, Barney Desai, today became the
first-long term political exile to return to South Africa in the
wake of de Klerk's announcement. Desai, 57, went into exile in 1962
while facing proscecution for defying restrictions placed on him by
police.

   Hundreds of pro-Cuban rebels ambushed a police
post in a remote jungle town early Saturday and fired on it for
hours, trapping 19 officers inside and killing two, authorities
said.
   The report said three rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement also died in the battle.
   According to the report, a column of 200 rebels surrounded the
police post in the town of Picota, 470 miles north of Lima, before
dawn Saturday.
   While some rebels kept the officers trapped officers inside,
others burned banks and government offices in the town, police
said. Two officers died and five were wounded.
   An interior ministry spokesman said police and army
reinforcements left Saturday morning for the zone, and all roads to
Picota had been closed.
   The Tupac army began fighting Peru's elected governments in 1984
and is the second-largest insurgent group operating in the country.
The stronger Shining Path, a Maoist group, launched its insurgency
in 1980.
   Police Friday reported nine deaths that were blamed on the
Shining Path last week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The birth control pill ushered in the sexual
revolution 30 years ago, but there have been so few new
contraceptives marketed in the United States since then that
American women now find their choices limited.
   ``We clearly have less available than other places,'' said Rep.
Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., ticking off a list of contraceptives
unavailable in the United States that includes long-acting hormonal
implants and injectables, as well as the French ``abortion'' pill
RU486.
   Planned Parenthood Federation of America is trying to build
support for more contraceptive research with a series of
conferences around the country, including one scheduled Monday in
Boston.
   A joint committee of the National Research Council and the
Institute of Medicine will release a report Wednesday on the
regulatory climate for development of new contraceptives.
   More than 13 million American women use oral contraceptives,
known collectively as ``the pill.''
   Used correctly, the pill is 99 percent effective, but ``its
existence does not mean it can be used safely and effectively by
everyone,'' said Rebecca Stone, director of public policy for the
private Center for Population Options.
   The pill has some minor side effects, must be taken daily and
it's not recommended for smokers over 35 and women with a history
of blood-clotting disorders, heart disease, breast cancer,
estrogen-dependent tumors, undiagnosed genital bleeding and a few
other conditions.
   In 1987, more than 8 million American women of reproductive age
chose to be sterilized as a method of birth control, while 6.9
million relied on condoms, 1.7 million used diaphragms, 1.2 million
chose spermicides, 1.1 million had IUDs and 1.1 million used
contraceptive sponges.
   Also, 2.3 million relied on withdrawal before ejaculation, 1.7
million used periodic abstinence and 3.3 million used nothing,
according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private education and
research group.
   The Food and Drug Administration soon is expected to approve a
device called Norplant, which prevents pregnancy for up to five
years.
   The silicone rubber capsules, each the size of a wooden
matchstick, are implanted in a woman's upper arm but can be removed
at any time to restore fertility. It already is on the market in 12
countries and is being tested in 40 others.
   When the pill became available in the United States in 1960,
researchers predicted it was just the beginning _ that soon there
would be more options, including vaccines and a pill for men.
   Thirty years later, the search for better contraceptives
continues but the pace has slowed to a crawl.
   In the early 1970s, there were 13 major pharmaceutical companies
_ eight in the United States _ conducting contraceptive research.
Today, there are three, and only one is a U.S. company _ Ortho
Pharmaceutical Corp.
   A few smaller companies and non-profit organizations are doing
research.
   The Upjohn Co. fought a nearly 20-year battle in an unsuccessful
effort to win FDA approval of Depo-Provera as a long-acting,
injectable contraceptive. It was opposed both by the religious
right and feminist health groups that cited possible cancer risks.
   Depo-Provera has been approved in more than 60 countries as a
contraceptive, including the United Kingdom, West Germany, Norway,
Sweden, France and Belgium. It is approved in the United States to
treat endometrial and renal cancers, and because it is an approved
drug, some physicians do prescribe it as a contraceptive.
   However, doctors prescribing any drug for any other than its
labeled use can face greater risk of liability.
   Some say the controversy over Depo-Provera helped chill the
research climate, but the fear of lawsuits is the most frequently
cited reason for the dropoff in efforts to find new contraceptives.
   Other factors include insufficient federal funding, high cost, a
cumbersome government approval process and spillover from the
anti-abortion movement.
   Stung by the fallout from A.H. Robins Co.'s intrauterine device,
the Dalkon Shield, G.D. Searle &amp; Co. went to court 19 times to
defend its Copper 7 IUD. Plaintiffs alleged that the Dalkon Shield
caused infections that led to infertility, spontaneous abortions
and, in some cases, death.
   Searle won 15 of the suits, but discontinued its IUD in 1986
because it could no longer get liability insurance, said
spokeswoman Kay Bruno.
   ``The ultimate loser is the American woman who doesn't have
these options in contraception anymore,'' Bruno said.
   Only ALZA Corp.'s Progestasert IUD remained on the market after
the Dalkon Shield controversy and only one new IUD had been
introduced since _ ParaGard, made by Gynopharma Inc.
   The government _ through the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development and the Agency for International Development
_ will spend about $20 million in 1990 on contraceptive research
and development.
   When other contraceptive-related research is added, such as
evaluating existing birth control methods, the total rises to about
$30 million.
   Dr. Gabriel Bialy, chief of the contraceptive development branch
at the institute, said research funds have been inadequate for
years.
   ``Contraceptive development does not have too much political
clout,'' Bialy said. However, he doesn't attribute the lack of
interest to pressure from anti-abortion groups, some of which also
oppose contraception.
   ``We were not terribly popular even in the era of more liberal
administrations.''
   Others, however, say abortion politics is having an impact.
   Anti-abortion forces persuaded Congress in the 1970s to prohibit
funding of research into contraceptive methods that work after
pregnancy, including the French abortion pill, RU486.
   RU486, approved in France and China, can act after the
implantation of a fertilized egg. In France, the pill cannot be
used beyond the fifth week after fertilization, or three weeks
after a missed menstrual period.
   A woman takes the drug orally and two days later is given an
injection or suppository of synthetic prostaglandin, which causes
contractions of the uterus to ensure it has evacuated completely.
   Anti-abortion groups have promised to boycott any company that
attempts to bring RU486 to the United States.
   Pro-choice activists are trying to channel emotional energy away
from the abortion controversy into contraceptive research.
   ``It seems to me if we want to reduce the number of abortions,
we need to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies ... with
better contraceptive options,'' said Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
   Schroeder and Snowe are sponsoring a bill to establish three
birth control research centers and two infertility research
centers, emphasizing research on new drugs and devices.
   Abortion foes oppose the bill, which calls for $77.2 million to
be spent over five years, because ``it was written to permit
federally funded research on abortion methods,'' said Douglas
Johnson, a spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee.
   Despite the controversy, Dr. J. Joseph Speidel, president of the
non-profit Population Crisis Committee, is optimistic.
   ``I don't think you can stop scientific progress,'' he said. ``I
think we'll have some new contraceptives available ... (but) a lot
of other countries will have them first.''

<HEAD>Hazelwood Hears In Court About the Day That Changed His Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a snow-covered courthouse about 125
miles from the scene of the nation's worst oil spill, Joseph
Hazelwood sits tugging nervously at his beard as testimony unwinds
about a day that changed his life forever.
   In the first week of his trial last week, the former Exxon
Valdez captain heard about every move he made and every drink he
took during a relaxed pre-sailing day ashore in the port town of
Valdez. It was a day that culminated in the crash of his vessel,
spilling a gooey mass more than 10 million gallons of Alaska crude
oil into the clear waters of Prince William Sound.
   The week ahead is expected to take Hazelwood back aboard the
987-foot tanker with officers recalling events that preceded the
March 24 grounding of the ship on jagged Bligh Reef.
   The prosecution's star witness, third mate Gregory Cousins, is
likely to shed some light on unexplained events including
Hazelwood's disappearance from the bridge for an hour before the
accident.
   Was Hazelwood drunk when the ship smashed into rocks? Or was the
accident the fault of Coast Guard traffic monitors? Did the skipper
leave an unqualified third mate, Cousins, in control of the ship?
Or had Hazelwood left precise instructions which would have kept
the tanker on a safe course?
   Those, among other questions, have been raised in the state
court trial which is the only criminal proceeding to arise from the
disaster.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is being tried on a felony
charge of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges
of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating
a vessel while intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on
all counts is seven years, three months in prison and $61,000 in
fines.
   The skipper's lawyers, Dick Madson and Michael Chalos, are
trying to show that Hazelwood was not reckless, a requirement for
being found guilty of criminal mischief. They also seek to blame
the Coast Guard for failing to notify Hazelwood that his ship was
heading for trouble.
   Madson maintains that Coast Guard monitors weren't watching the
radar screen when the accident occurred.
   Hazelwood's day ashore is at the center of the allegations
against him. Witnesses outlined the path he took through Valdez on
that frosty day when light snow fell and Easter was approaching.
   Three of Hazelwood's shipmates said the captain asked them to
lunch. He stopped at his shipping agent's office, made some phone
calls, then headed to the Pizza Palace where he and his buddies
lunched. Hazelwood drank iced tea.
   After lunch, marine pilot William E. Murphy drove Hazelwood to a
small shopping center where the captain may have entered a flower
store to send flowers to his wife for Easter. Or he may have gone
directly to the Pipeline Club, a bar across the street. The point
is in dispute.
   Perhaps the week's most controversial witness was Janice
Delozier, wife of a Coast Guard investigator on the disaster, who
claimed she saw Hazelwood drinking at the Pipeline Club hours
before anyone else saw him. She said the captain was ordering vodka
at 1:45 p.m. His shipmates say he got to the bar about 4 p.m. The
time element relates to how much liquor he might have consumed
before sailing that evening.
   Mrs. Delozier acknowledged during cross-examination that she
waited 10 days to come forward with her account because she thought
people would consider her story ``fishy,'' given her husband's link
to the case. And she feared questions about why she had spent her
lunch hour in a bar. She said she went there to drink coffee.
   And ``how come'' she hadn't discussed her recollections with
others in the bar that day, asked attorney Chalos.
   ``There's no `how come' involved,'' snapped the witness. ``I'm
not the town crier!''
   But she painted Valdez as a small town where residents know
everybody and discuss the local news.
   No matter how many drinks Hazelwood consumed, one thing remained
undisputed at week's end _ the captain did not appear drunk. Murphy
and two other officers said there was a telltale trace of alcohol
on the captain's breath, but he didn't stagger or show any other
signs of intoxication.
   ``Did he seem in command of this vessel?'' asked Chalos.
   ``Oh, absolutely,'' said Murphy.
   A blood-alcohol test administered to Hazelwood 10{ hours after
the accident showed a level of.061, under the state limit for
driving but above the federal limit for operating a commercial
vessel.

<HEAD>Text of President's Announcement On Mandela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President
F.W. de Klerk's statement Saturday on Nelson Mandela's release:
   In pursuance of my opening address to Parliament, I am now in a
position to announce that Mr. Nelson Mandela will be released at
the Victor Verster prison on Sunday, the 11th of February at about
3 p.m.
   Yesterday evening I met with Mr. Mandela in Cape Town, together
with Ministers (Gerrit) Viljoen and (Kobie) Coetsee. During the
meeting, Mr. Mandela was informed of the government's decision
regarding his release.
   We would all like Mr. Mandela's release to take place in a
dignified and orderly manner. To attain this, government officials
are at the moment involved in discussions with parties concerned in
order to afford them the opportunity to make suitable arrangements.
   Two issues were also raised during the discussions between me
and Mr. Mandela, namely, the state of emergency and the position of
persons serving sentences for politically motivated crimes, as well
as those who have committed such crimes and are now outside the
country.
   I stressed the importance of creating conditions which would
enable me to lift the state of emergency without jeopardizing the
maintenance of law and order. Regarding the position of persons
involved in politically motivated crimes, I indicated that while
this is a matter that should be dealt with in negotiations,
exploratory discussions could take place in the meantime.
   I want to emphasize that there can no longer be any doubt about
the government's sincerity to create a just dispensation based on
negotiation. I call upon Mr. Mandela and all other interested
parties to make their contribution towards a positive climate for
negotiations.
   The eyes of the world are presently focused on all South
Africans. All of us now have an opportunity and the responsibility
to prove that we are capable of a peaceful process in creating a
new South Africa.
   Ladies and gentlemen, this announcement and tomorrow will bring
us to the end of a long chapter. What I've announced today was
started by my predecessor a number of years ago. Since the moment
that Mr. Mandela met him at Townhouse, and since the moment that in
that discussion Mr. Mandela clearly stated his commitment, also, to
peaceful solutions, it has become a certainty that he would be
released.
   Also in my two discussions with him, late last year and last
evening, I came to the conclusion that he is committed to a
peaceful solution and a peaceful process. The government is
committed to negotiation. The government is committed to bring
about through negotiation a new constitution which is fair and just
to all the people of South Africa. I hope that now that this
chapter is ended, the world and more especially all the people of
South Africa will grasp the opportunity and play whatever
supportive role can be played toward a peaceful conclusion of the
process which has started.

<HEAD>Mayor Warns of Counterrevolution in `Martyr City'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIMISOARA, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of members of Romania's
hated Securitate secret police have eluded authorities and may be
plotting a ``counterrevolution'' to seize control, Timisoara's
mayor warned.
   Alemorean Pompiliu, in an interview with The Associated Press on
Friday, also said the official death toll of 100 that officials
reported for Timisoara in the December revolution was far too low.
He said doctors were intimidated into underreporting the number of
deaths.
   Timisoara, the cradle of the popular revolution that toppled
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu on Dec. 22, is officially
described as Romania's ``martyr city'' for its heavy toll in blood.
   The city continues to suffer, with shortages of basic foods,
especially eggs and milk. Long lines of shoppers, loudly
complaining of the shortages, wait outside stores selling chicken
imported from Czechoslovakia.
   The ousted Communist system also left behind ``a series of
social problems such as bad working habits and massive
alcoholism,'' Pompiliu said.
   ``We have accomplished only 20 percent of the revolution by
changing the old system. Now, the new system has to change the
people,'' Pompiliu said.
   In addition, dangerous vestiges of the old system remain a
threat, he warned.
   ``The situation in Timisoara is still chaotic and fluid and we
know that the Securitate is active, possibly planning a
counterrevolution,'' said Pompiliu, an architect who assumed the
mayor's post after the revolution.
   ``Only the heads'' of the Securitate were arrested, he said,
estimating that about 15,000 secret police members remain at large
in his city of 350,000. Timisoara is about 310 miles west of
Bucharest.
   Immediately after the victory of the revolution, Romanian and
foreign media reports said as many as 4,000 people had died in
Timisoara in clashes with the Securitate troops, who were fiercely
loyal to Ceausescu and battled the army when it joined the popular
revolt against the dictator.
   But officials recently said that according to reliable
information only some 100 were killed and about 40 were reported
missing. They said, however, that the figure was not final.
   ``Both the official and the original figures are far from being
correct. The true death toll is somewhere in between,'' Pompiliu
said.
   ``It is a well known fact'' that the experts who estimated the
official death toll and family members of the dead have received
telephone threats apparently from still-active Securitate members
``in order to list the victims as if they had died of natural
causes,'' he said.
   Dusan Nicolicin, the secretary of the Timisoara City Council,
estimated that 1,000 people died in the December fighting.
   He added that Dr. Leonard Drexler, the chief medical expert
whose team released the official death toll figure in Timisoara,
``was under strong pressure from the Securitate.''
   Nicolicin's statement was backed by Romania Libera and other
newspapers, which claimed that the director of the municipal
hospital was a close relative of Timisoara's former secret police
chief. Drexler was not available for comment.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of wreaths and lit candles cover the steps
and plaza facing the Orthodox Cathdral where numerous people were
gunned down during the uprising.
   ``Now they tell us only about 100 people died. That's
impossible, since ... during just one day (of violence) I saw with
my own eyes more than 40 dead lying in front of this church,'' said
Liana Serbac, a relative of one victim.

<HEAD>The Rise And Fall of Katie Tucker: Hardball Politics In Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Katie Tucker was on top of her world as
1990 began, serving as the state's chief tax collector after 23
years in state government. Last week she resigned in disgrace and
faces felony charges.
   Talk of Ms. Tucker's downfall has dominated the state capital
since mid-January, when reports surfaced that she had personally
ordered a 1988 tax investigation as a vendetta.
   On Tuesday, Ms. Tucker, 46, resigned her $85,292-a-year job as
director of the Department of Revenue, minutes before Republican
Gov. Bob Martinez and the independently elected, six-member state
Cabinet were poised to fire her.
   After an investigation by the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement, a state investigative agency, she was arrested
Wednesday on felony charges of altering documents, allegedly in a
misguided attempt to prove the 1988 tax probe was part of a larger
investigation to root out tax evaders.
   Her disgrace comes at an opportune time for the beleaguered
Martinez, who is fighting for his political life while polls for
this fall's governor's race showing Democrats could beat him and
even Republican voters don't like him.
   ``We're not beating our chests on this thing, but certainly the
governor handled it appropriately and protected the taxpayers,''
said Brian Ballard, Martinez's director of operations. ``He led on
it.''
   Martinez, who backed Ms. Tucker in the 4-3 Cabinet vote that got
her the top tax job in 1988, led the fight to oust her.
   ``All I can say is I must have stepped on some mighty big
toes,'' Ms. Tucker said soon after resigning. ``It must have been
somebody with the ability to ... cause problems every time I tried
to do anything.''
   Ms. Tucker's troubles began when the FDLE, following Martinez's
orders, investigated a report that she had personally ordered her
department to look into the books of Tallahassee businesses owned
by Donald G. Resha _ who lost a 1985 race for the presidency of the
state AFL-CIO to Ms. Tucker's husband.
   The FDLE found no crime. But Martinez and the Cabinet voted Jan.
23 to suspend Ms. Tucker for two weeks and allow her time to prove
the Resha case was not a vendetta.
   After what aides said was a rambling hourlong interview between
Ms. Tucker and Martinez, the governor called for a second FDLE
investigation into Ms. Tucker's claims she did not single out
Resha. That probe found nothing to back up her story and suggested
she had lied to Martinez.
   Her troubles could have been avoided if she had admitted some
overzealousness or perhaps even a few mistakes, Ballard said.
   Instead, he said, ``there were contradictory explanations of the
storyline, then there were denials, new stories, new denials. I
don't think we'll ever know exactly what happened.''
   Things started getting mysterious soon after Martinez called for
her resignation Jan. 29.
   The FDLE said Ms. Tucker made two after-hours visits to her
office to type up backdated documents exonerating her, showing one
to a revenue department employee after telling him someone had left
it anonymously on her porch.
   The alleged falsifications turned up when her deputy revenue
director, Sam Alexander, fearing his name was being used in
forgery, showed authorities scrap of paper with his initials on it
and the center snipped out.
   Locks on the department doors were changed to keep Ms. Tucker
out, and her typewriter and files were seized. The tape cartridge
of the typewriter showed a document prepared Jan. 31 was backdated
to Dec. 21, 1988, according to an FDLE affidavit.
   That led to the charges against Ms. Tucker, who turned herself
in one day after her resignation. She pleaded innocent to the
charges and was released on her own recognizance.
   State Attorney Willie Meggs said Ms. Tucker faces up to five
years in prison and $5,000 in fines, but he doubts she would ever
do any time. ``It's a little premature to say that, but I think I
can safely say no,'' Meggs said.
   Ms. Tucker also said she was resigning because she has been
diagnosed with breast cancer and expects to learn a long-term
prognosis in seven to 22 months. ``It is not worth even a moment
more of wasted energy on fights that only hurt me and certainly
don't deserve my life,'' she said in her resignation.

   Residents hit by Hurricane Hugo needing
everything from ice and water to food and a place to sleep didn't
have to fight city hall for help.
   They turned at the rate of some 150 people a day to the city's
ombudsman, a soft-spoken, energetic woman who has been fielding
residents' gripes for 8{ years.
   Barbara Vaughn and her staff fielded thousands of calls from
residents who weathered the worst hurricane to hit the antebellum
seaport in more than two centuries. Hugo smashed ashore at
Charleston on Sept. 21 leaving 29 dead and $5.9 billion in damage
as it swept across South Carolina.
   Those who did not fare as badly simply wanted reassurance in the
days after the storm. Later, some needed a place to vent their
frustrations.
   ``Somehow, we did become a focus for the frustration. It didn't
do any good to yell at the roofer because that didn't make him work
any faster,'' Ms. Vaughn said in an interview last week.
   Her office helps residents who have problems with city services,
or puts them in touch with those who can help if they city can't.
Ms. Vaughn, 47, who has a college degree in psycholgy, said she got
into her present job after working with her neighborhood community
association.
   In the first few days after the storm, Ms. Vaughn and her staff
of two worked 18-hour days fielding about 150 calls daily. They
found themselves counselors as much as anything else.
   ``People weren't angry or hostile. They were frightened and
wanted help,'' she said.
   Later, there were complaints about the debris cleanup from
frustrated residents who wanted the garbage picked up more quickly.
Other irate citizens called to complain that crews knocked over
their mailboxes while removing debris.
   Why so much fuss about a mailbox? Ms. Vaughn has a theory.
   After weathering the storm, suffering property damage and going
without power for days, ``that was the proverbial last straw,'' she
said. ``The mailbox was not a life and death issue,'' but it gave
people a reason to vent their anger.
   Many residents called with problems beyond the city's control.
But the staff would listen and often, by the time they hung up,
callers seemed satisfied simply to have had someone listen.
   Nearly five months later, the office still fields calls from
those with storm-related problems, but the calls are dwindling.
   On the federal level, too, calls for help are dwindling.
Disaster assistance applications filed with the Federal Emergency
Management Agency have steadily decreased but there are no
immediate plans to pull out of South Carolina, an agency spokesman
said Friday.
   ``We will be here as long as it takes,'' Frank Mosco said.
   One day last week, FEMA received fewer than 100 applications,
the least since the storm. ``There is light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Mosco said.
   FEMA has distributed nearly $95 million to 60,000 eligible South
Carolina Hugo victims.
   At times, Ms. Vaughn felt she was not doing enough.
   ``I understood we were dealing with people's frustration,'' she
said. ``But nothing would have pleased me more than to drop
everything and go out and help. I wished I had a dump truck or a
chainsaw.
   ``It was hard to say to someone this is the greatest disaster to
hit Charleston in over 200 years and that putting the pieces back
in order is not an overnight thing.''

<TEXT>
   In an age of worry about the ``greenhouse''
effect, ozone depletion and air pollution, the thought of trying to
solve the Earth's environmental problems may be enough to give many
people a headache.
   But what if we succeed? What will the world be like sometime in
the next century?
   The Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based environmental think
tank, sketches considers such questions in its annual look at the
Earth and its environmental problems.
   The institute selected the year 2030 as the point at which
mankind will succeed in building ``a sustainable society'' _ one in
which basic human needs are met without jeopardizing future
generations by putting the environment at risk.
   That's a scant 40 years from today, soon enough that hundreds of
millions of people living today will _ if it comes to pass _ still
be able to see it. ``It's closer than World War II,'' Lester Brown,
president of Worldwatch and the study's director, said in an
interview last week.
   While there is certainly no agreement within the scientific or
environmental communities on whether such a world realistically can
emerge in such a short period of time, the Worldwatch researchers
provide a peek into at least one scenario that might develop if
mankind comes to grips with today's environmental challenges.
   On a ``self sustainable'' Earth in the year 2030, Worldwatch
says our society may look like this:
   _Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas no longer will
be relied upon as the primary source of energy; instead energy
needs will come primarily from solar and wind power. Farmers will
harvest ``energy crops'' in marginal lands to run motor vehicles.
   _Solar thermal plants will stretch across vast deserts and
prairie lands. Some ranchers may earn more money from selling
electricity than cattle as cities such as Denver and Kansas City,
Mo., rely on the wind for their electric needs.
   _The automobile no longer will be king _ replaced by mass
transit and in many cases the bicycle, with bike trails
crisscrossing communities. The cars that survive will get 100 or
more miles to the gallon of fuel.
   ``People will be living closer to their jobs, and much
socializing and shopping will be done by bike rather than
automobile,'' the Worldwatch researchers say. Mass transit will
welcome ``bike-and-ride'' customers.
   _Citizens will be staying home more, relying on computerized
delivery services for their shopping and working in satellite
offices at home, freeing today's crowded highways.
   _Conserving energy will be a hallmark of the ``self
sustainable'' world of 2030 since total global carbon emissions,
which come from burning fossil fuels and are blamed for global
warming, would be reduced markedly.
   _Homes will be so weather tight that it will not pay to install
a furnace. Instead, homeowners will rely on small electric heaters.
And lights and appliances will be so efficient residents may see
``almost the complete elimination of utility bills.''
   _Today's largely ``throw-away-society'' will be replaced by a
``recycling ethic'' that will touch everything from milk bottles to
automobiles.
   _The steel industry will rely on old automobiles, appliances and
other equipment for raw materials.
   _Bottles containing everything from beer to milk will be
interchangeable and returnable, perhaps routed through a central
computerized inventory. And the fancy, often excessive, packaging
that lines today's supermarkets will be prohibited by government
regulators to cut down on waste.
   Shoppers will return to using canvas bags to carry home their
purchases, ridding supermarkets of today's reusable paper or
plastic bags.
   The Worldwatch researchers acknowledged these changes will
require ``a new set of values'' in the self sustainable world of
2030.
   ``It will become unfashionable to own fancy new cars and
clothes,'' they say, adding, ``This shift (away from materialism)
will be among the hardest to make.''

   Lattie McGee was only 4, but he knew as much
about torture as any concentration camp inmate or prisoner of war.
His prison was a dark closet in his family's South Side apartment,
where he often was hung upside down, bound and gagged, for hours.
   Lattie liked to play with his toy cars, dance silly with his
brother, watch cartoons and romp in the mud outside when the
weather was warm.
   But Lattie's joyous childhood vanished the summer of 1987, a
summer of torture. Testimony about the agonies he endured shocked
prosecutors, defense attorneys and even the judge.
   Lattie's mother and her live-in boyfriend, who said he beat
Lattie and his brother because he thought they were homosexual, are
to be sentenced Thursday by Cook County Criminal Court Judge
Michael B. Getty.
   Getty called Lattie's death ``the most heinous, brutally
sadistic torture and murder ... that I have ever heard in my 6{
years as a judge, my over 10 years as a prosecutor, or indeed my 51
years on this Earth.''
   Lattie was starved, burned with a hot iron, stuck with pins and
needles, singed with cigarettes, beaten with a tree branch, hair
brush, belt and hands, scalded with steaming water, and tied up
with a clothesline, rope and tights for 2{ months that summer,
court testimony showed.
   A severe blow to his head in August was the eventual cause of
death, but his emaciated body, scarred from head to foot, was so
infected from untreated wounds that he likely would have died a
short time later, a pathologist from the county medical examiner's
office testified.
   Criminal convictions in abuse cases are more an exception than
the rule unless the child dies, said Dr. Demetra Soter, coordinator
of the Pediatric Trauma Unit at Cook County Hospital.
   Abuse cases often are not prosecuted, or even investigated,
until the victim is killed because ``people in high levels of
position can't believe that people torture children,'' she said.
``Hopefully with people seeing stuff like this, they'll start to
believe that it really happens.''
   Lattie's was one of 40,278 reported cases of child abuse or
neglect in Cook County in 1987 and one of 38 reported deaths, said
David Schneidman, a spokesman for the state Department of Children
and Family Services. Statewide, there were 91,723 cases and 54
deaths, he said.
   The numbers are worse for 1988, the most recent period for which
statistics are available. In Cook County, 54 of the 42,564 reported
abuse or neglect cases ended in death, Schneidman said. Statewide,
91,723 cases of abuse or neglect and 98 deaths were reported.
   The night before Lattie died, his mother's boyfriend, Johnny
Campbell, taped potato peels over the boy's eyes and hung him in
the closet, court records show.
   When Lattie was taken down the next day, Aug. 14, 1987, and
asked for water, Campbell told him to act like a man and get it
himself. Lattie tried, but, sapped of strength, failed. Campbell
punched him in the head, the records show.
   When Lattie didn't move, his mother called an ambulance. He was
pronounced dead on arrival at South Shore Hospital. Lattie weighed
26 pounds, the size of a normal 1-year-old.
   Dr. Shaku Teas, the pathologist who did the autopsy, was asked
by a prosecutor if she found anything remarkable about his injuries.
   ``Everything was remarkable,'' she said, describing his injuries
in gruesome detail as photographs of his body were shown in court.
   His pelvis had been broken several days before he died, and two
of his ribs had been snapped several weeks earlier, Ms. Teas
testified.
   Campbell, 40, pleaded guilty Dec. 6 to murdering Lattie and
beating the boy's brother, Cornelius Abraham, now 8. His attorney
says Campbell is psychotic.
   On Jan. 11, Getty convicted the children's 28-year-old mother,
Alicia Abraham, on the same charges; she acknowledged never
reporting the torture of her children but said she did not abuse
them herself.
   Prosecutors have urged Getty to order the pair executed for what
Assistant State's Attorney James Bigoness called ``a truly
abominable crime.''
   ``It's probably one of the ugliest cases you will ever see,''
said Clyde Lemons Jr., Ms. Abraham's attorney, who argued that she
was guilty of bad judgment but was not a murderer.
   Lavonne Steger, 18, whose parents cared for Ms. Abraham as a
child when her own parents died, still cries when talking about
Lattie. She considers Ms. Abraham her sister and often played with
the children when they were brought over for a visit.
   Cornelius liked to play basketball and read. Lattie was a quiet
boy with shining dark eyes and a sweet smile.
   ``He liked to go outside and play in the mud,'' Miss Steger said
in a telephone interview, her voice at times choking with emotion.
Other days, ``He just liked to watch cartoons and play with his
cars. He was happy.''
   Lattie was the second child born to Ms. Abraham. A small, stocky
woman, she dropped out of South Shore High School when she became
pregnant with Cornelius and had Lattie two years later. She never
married the boys' father, Lattie McGee Sr., an attendant at the
county's home for juvenile delinquents.
   The couple were together five years until splitting up in 1984,
and she had another son and a daughter with another man. The
younger children live with their paternal grandmother, under legal
guardianship of the Department of Children and Family Services.
   McGee, who now has Cornelius, could not be reached to talk about
the case. Calls to his home went unanswered or were disconnected
when a reporter called.
   Unemployed and on public aid, Ms. Abraham was accused of neglect
in 1985 after state authorities found her living in a filthy
apartment with no furniture. Her sons slept on the floor and were
inadequately fed, court records show.
   Ms. Abraham underwent counseling. After months of supervision,
state investigators determined the situation had improved.
   But then she met Johnny Campbell, a short, fine-boned man with
powerfully muscled arms who said he was a Vietnam veteran and
ex-steel worker who'd been fired for alcohol and drug abuse.
   In early 1987, Campbell moved into the small apartment Ms.
Abraham shared with her four children on the top floor of a tidy
six-story brick apartment building in the South Shore district, a
black, mostly middle-class neighborhood along Chicago's southern
lakefront.
   Lattie's father, who kept in touch with his boys and has
attended court proceedings, last saw them in early June 1987 when
Cornelius graduated from kindergarten, Bigoness said. Both children
appeared healthy.
   Things quickly changed.

   Given two minutes to gather all the compact discs

emotional _ would be key.
   So the opera-lover, who won the shopping spree through a bank

practiced yoga for control, figured out how to make her hands
sticky, drew maps of the terrain and developed memory-nudging
devices.
   ``I knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I had to go
for it and meet the challenge,'' Lyles said Saturday.
   In the end, she raced through the Tower Records building Friday
scooping up 60 compact discs, chiefly classical ones, and ran up a
bill of $2,054 during her two-minute allotment _ five times what
the promotors figured each contestant would rake in.
   The 34-year-old Melrose resident was one of three people whose
names were drawn a week ago for a two-minute shopping dash.
   The folks at BayBank had estimated shelling out about $400 per
contestant to promote a new branch. Little did they realize that
lavish boxed sets of some classical music collections go for $250
per.
   ``I didn't do it intentionally, but I was told outright there
were no restrictions,'' Lyles said. ``I knew I could not afford to
purchase 180 boxed sets so I said to myself: `I'm going to hit
these.'''
   Lyles, a fund-raiser for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, spotted
which aisles had the best things, estimated the trips she would
need and made up sing-song ditties to jog her memory about what she
wanted.
   She also discovered that a tacky cloth she and her husband used
to strip furniture gave her sticky fingers. When her time came at
Tower Records, she was ready.
   ``When I see something, well, don't stand in my way!'' Lyles
said. ``Yoga helps you get a hold of yourself, but in the end its
that animal drive and knowing what you want.''
   ``This is her normal way of doing things, only very condensed,''
said her husband, James.
   Jaymes Leavitt, a Northeastern University freshman from Paxton,
eclipsed Lyles' haul by gathering up 86 compact discs, but his
taste was less expensive at a grand total of $1,300 worth of
merchandise.
   Another Northeastern freshman, Edward Monette of West Hampton
Beach, N.Y., was the third entrant, staggering out the door with 59
compact discs worth $900 and weighing about 30 pounds.
   Over the past week, Leavitt and Monette were looking over the
store's second floor layout of $15 hard rock CDs while Lyles was on
the third floor, checking out $250 boxed sets of Bach's organ works
and Wagner's Ring Cycle.

   The main opposition coalition in the
Feb. 25 election has been hampered by fear, low funding, personal
rivalry, ideological divisions and a presidential candidate with a
fractured knee.
   But it is drawing ever increasing crowds to its rallies, and its
true strength may be even larger on election day.
   The ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front's rallies are
larger and better organized than those of the United National
Opposition, but they are also salted with government employees who
fear they would risk their jobs if they don't attend.
   ``You'll never see me at an UNO rally,'' said a 37-year-old
Managua professional who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There's
still a chance of violence, and who wants to get beaten up? But I'm
voting for UNO. That's for sure.''
   The UNO candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the
opposition newspaper La Prensa, suffered a fractured knee on New
Year's Eve and has been campaigning from a wheelchair in the back
of a pickup truck under a sun tent, looking like ``a saint at a
procession,'' as one of her aides put it.
   Attendance at UNO rallies has shot from several hundred into the
thousands in the last three weeks _ an estimated 7,000 in the town
of Jinotepe; 6,000 in Granada; 10,000 in Esteli; 7,000 in Rivas.
   ``I know some people will come by tomorrow to nag you about
having come,'' said Mrs. Chamorro in Esteli, referring to the
Sandinistas. ``But just remember your vote is secret.''
   President Daniel Ortega, seeking another six-year term, has shed
his sober image and campaigned vigorously in T-shirts and bomber
jackets. The Sandinistas have also enlisted Alf, the U.S. TV
situation comedy character who is a favorite of Nicaraguan children.
   Alf, a fuzzy space alien with a long snout, is pictured on wall
murals as telling his Planet Earth host Willy that he will vote
Sandinista.
   An inveterate cat-hater, Alf also is pictured squeezing the neck
of a feline representing UNO. Sandinista spokesmen said they did
not know if Alf's creators had given their permission for the alien
endorsement.
   In any case, the Sandinistas seem to be nervous.
   ``And when you return to your neighborhoods, to your villages,
talk to your neighbor, to your friend, to your relative, to anyone
who still might be confused,'' urged Ortega at a rally in Somoto.
   Violence subsided after an UNO rally in Masatepe last December
turned into a bloodly riot that left one dead and about 20 injured.
Police now patrol every rally, and international election observers
have praised the job they're doing to keep order.
   Confusion is what seemed to reign at an UNO rally Feb. 4 in the
small town of Posoltega.
   A brief fistfight erupted between Antonio Lacayo, campaign
manager and Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law, and Jaime Bonilla of the
Independent Liberal Party, which provided Mrs. Chamorro's running
mate, Virgilio Godoy.
   Nobody at UNO wanted to discuss the fight, in which Lacayo and
Bonilla exchanged punches on stage before an amused crowd.
   The brawl pointed to deep divisions within UNO, a coalition of
14 parties with a broad range of ideologies from communist to
conservative whose only common denominator is their opposition to
the Sandinistas.
   Personal and ideological rifts have been reported pitting Godoy
against Lacayo; Mrs. Chamorro's son, Pedro Joaquin, against Mrs.
Chamorro's close adviser, former Contra directorate member Alfredo
Cesar; and a host of other minor rivalries.
   Mrs. Chamorro's choice of campaign manager has been called an
example of nepotism. Lacayo, a businessman, has no previous
political experience.
   The opposition also complains of lack of money, and the U.N.
observer mission has noted the Sandinistas' continued use of
government property. Use of public property is allowed, but a party
has to pay for it.
   Last week Soviet-made military helicopters flew over the town of
Juigalpa, showering Sandinista flyers and touting an Ortega rally.
   The Sandinistas regularly try to cut attendance at UNO rallies
by scheduling baseball games or free parties at the same time.
   Pressure tactics apparently have not muzzled some. As people
were boarding about 100 trucks and buses to return to their towns
and villages following a Sandinista rally in Jinotepe, one man
climbing into a large truck yelled a loud and defiant, ``Viva la
UNO!''
   There are no reliable polls to help observers call the race, and
crowd-counting sometimes is the only game in town.
   UNO and Sandinista crowds were about equal at rallies in
Granada, Nicaragua's second-largest city, but there was
considerably more visible enthusiasm at the UNO rally. However, in
Jinotepe the UNO rally was only half the size of the Sandinista
rally.
   ``My impression so far is that a lot of people are playing it
safe, but that on the day of the voting they'll quietly put their
cross on UNO,'' said a senior West European diplomat.
   Mrs. Chamorro scored a point with an endorsement Thursday from
Yatama, a coalition of Atlantic Coast Indians. The Indians may
represent as many as 80,000 votes in the 1.7 million-strong
electorate.
   Meanwhile, the Sandinistas are wooing as many groups as possible
and trying to take the wind out of Mrs. Chamorro's sails. On
Friday, the government released 39 former members of dictator
Anastasio Somoza's National Guard and almost 1,000 captured Contra
guerrillas.
   Mrs. Chamorro's promise to ``open the jails'' once she was
elected had been one of her top applause lines.
   Taking advantage of a strong Roman Catholic cult of the Virgin
Mary, Mrs. Chamorro usually wears white to signify purity.
   That has been the despair of news photographers, who frequently
swirl around searching for a way to avoid photographing the
white-clad candidate against the brilliant tropical sunshine.

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft developed
camera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer toward
its 1995 encounter with Jupiter.
   Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snapping
five dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, project
scientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission.
   Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, after
taking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open and
closed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faulty
commands from the probe's main computer.
   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwanted
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately
understood, and a NASA was working to fix the problem.
   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harm
the 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, and
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, project
manager Dick Spehalski said.
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
9:59 p.m. PST Friday. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles above
the furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, but
actually came three or four miles closer, said mission science and
design manager Bill O'Neil.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach Jupiter,'' he said.
   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if the
malfunction prevents Galileo from snapping an additional five dozen
planned pictures of Venus, which has been photographed by numerous
other spacecraft, Johnson said.
   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensors
studied the makeup of Venus' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mapped
cloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, Johnson said.
   The pictures and data were stored on Galileo's tape recorder,
and won't be sent back to Earth until October when the spacecraft
is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.
That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep
Galileo operating.
   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past Earth
on Dec. 8.
   The $1.35 billion mission also will let Galileo examine Earth,
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates
into an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995,
they arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a
2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.
   Galileo was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18.
   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above Venus' surface, trapping
heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surface
temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90
times that on Earth.
   Ausman said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondary
to the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to
88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.
   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to Jupiter,''
Johnson said.
   Galileo will use the Earth as a gravity slingshot next December
and again Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward
Jupiter, Ausman said.
   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,
will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar map at
least 70 percent of Venus' surface during a $550 million mission.
   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense
heat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph and
study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the
planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager
spacecraft.
   Galileo's roundabout route to Jupiter is an indirect result of
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members. After the tragedy, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration decided against using powerful, volatile,
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were
deployed from shuttles.
   Instead, Galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it was
released from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to use
the gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim Galileo toward
Jupiter. A Centaur would have propelled Galileo to Venus in only
two years.
   Environmentalists failed in court to block Galileo's mission.
They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate Florida
with plutonium in Galileo's nuclear batteries, which generate
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.
NASA said the risk was minimal.

   A man was sentenced to 99 years in
prison Friday for stabbing his estranged wife with a drill bit and
twice setting her on fire as she begged him to help her.
   A jury that heard Janice Stovall's dying words on tape
deliberated less than 12 minutes Thursday before convicting Martin
Stovall, 39, of murder in the killing of his estranged wife last
September.
   Stovall tearfully told jurors things ``went nuts'' about a month
after the couple separated when Mrs. Stovall refused to let him
attend their daughter's 13th birthday party.
   Mrs. Stovall, with third-degree burns over virtually her entire
body, tape-recorded a statement at Parkland Memorial Hospital.
   Gasping for breath and apologizing for memory lapses, she said
her husband backed her into a drill bit in the garage, doused her
with gasoline, set her on fire, then locked the garage door. He
returned and set her on fire again, she said.
   When Mrs. Stovall, a nurse, heard how serious her injuries were,
she said ``Just let me die,'' a paramedic testified. Her dying
declaration ended with a plea for hospital officials to ``protect
my children, please.''
   The 99-year sentence handed out Friday was the maximum for the
charge under which Stovall was convicted.

   Three mining officials were arrested on
charges of criminal negligence Saturday in connection with a mine
explosion and fire that killed 67 men, Turkish news reports said.
   The Anatolia news agency identified the three as mine director
Hasan Saritepe, chief engineer Cemal Tiryakioglu and safety
engineer Husnu Meydan.
   Earlier Saturday, Saritepe and Tiryakioglu were fired from their
posts.
   The Anatolia and Hurriyet news agencies said soldiers and police
had to restrain grieving relatives of the victims who tried to
attack the men.
   The crowd shouted ``Murderers!'' and threw stones at the van
taking them away to the northern city of Merzifon, where the
charges were filed. Each faces four to 10 years in prison if
convicted.
   Fire erupted in the Yeniceltic mine, 240 miles northeast of
Ankara, following a powerful metane gas explosion.
   Union officials and relatives of the victims have alleged that
Saritepe was aware of methane gas leakage in the mine but failed to
evacuate the pit 316 yards underground.
   Officials initially said 58 miners were trapped in the mine. But
they said Saturday that one more miner missing since Wednesday
evening's explosion was now believed trapped. The missing miners
were presumed dead. The bodies of eight other miners were removed
from the mine.
   Two workers were injured.
   The fire was still burning Saturday, Anatolia said.

   Fire broke out Saturday at a

casualties, the official CTK news agency said.
   The agency said the fire was contained shortly after it broke
out and that there were no injuries or ``any harm to health done.''
   The terse report blamed the fire on a faulty turbo-generator.
   The fire at the Jaslovske Bohunice plant, 185 miles west of
Prague, occurred at 5:28 a.m. after ``increased vibration damaged
an oil pipe and led to an oil leak'' that sparked the fire, CTK

<HEAD>Gramm-Rudman Could Blunt Liberals' Defense-Budget Ax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This could be the year that the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law goes from boon to boomerang, as far as
liberal Democrats eager to cut the defense budget are concerned.
   Since its inception in 1985, the law has served as a guillotine
over the heads of Congress and the White House. If the two sides
prove unable to shrink the federal deficit to a series of declining
annual levels, the law automatically triggers spending cuts,
divided 50-50 between defense and domestic programs.
   Democrats signed onto the law because they knew then-President
Reagan would be reluctant to risk the heavy slashes Gramm-Rudman
would impose on his cherished defense buildup.
   But now, some Democrats who want dramatic reductions in the
Pentagon's coffers in the wake of political changes in Eastern
Europe say the law now produces just the opposite effect.
   Liberals worry that if they push for defense slashes so deep
that they exceed or even approach what the Gramm-Rudman ax would
chop away, President Bush might just let Gramm-Rudman go to work.
That would mean deep cuts not just in defense, but in many domestic
programs dear to Democrats' hearts.
   ``That's the dilemma we're in,'' says Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich.,
a member of the House Budget Committee and a longtime fighter for
child nutrition, education and other social programs. ``The
president holds the hammer on us this year.''
   This is having a practical effect on the debate over the
so-called peace dividend, the savings expected to flow from the
brakes that are being applied to next year's Pentagon's budget.
   Bush's proposed $1.23 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1991 _
which starts Oct. 1 _ seeks $303.3 billion for defense. That is $7
billion more than this year's allowance, but $3.2 billion less than
the amount that would have been needed to let military spending
keep pace with inflation.
   Democrats _ and many Republicans _ want to cut deeper. But the
simple arithmetic of Gramm-Rudman dictates how much deeper they can
go without risking trouble.
   Under current official projections, lawmakers and Bush will have
to find $36.5 billion in savings to pare the 1991 deficit to the
Gramm-Rudman target of $64 billion.
   Should there be a budget stalemate between Congress and the
White House, those cuts would be imposed automatically, about $18.3
billion apiece on defense and domestic programs.
   Under the law's peculiar math, cuts are made from the amount a
program would be expected to grow to, when inflation and other
factors are considered. That means that should the Gramm-Rudman
cuts take effect, defense spending would be pared to about $288.2
billion. The number could change, based on congressional action and
unexpected economic performance.
   Thus, $288.2 billion flashes like an amber danger light for some
Democratic budget writers. Cut the defense budget to near that
level, they fear, and Bush can threaten to let Gramm-Rudman and its
slashes in domestic initiatives take effect.
   Not everyone agrees with this scenario. For one thing, many
Democrats are talking about defense spending levels that would not
go quite so low. For another, this is an election year, which means
lawmakers want to avoid a lengthy budget fight so they will have
time to campaign.
   ``Congress will want to be out of town some time in early
October,'' says Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional
Budget Office, Congress' non-partisan budget analysts. ``If the
past is any indication, they won't want to come back for a lame
duck session, they're going to want to have their ... (spending)
bills passed.''
   Nonetheless, the automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts kicked in last
October when Bush engaged Congress in a lengthy and unsuccessful
fight to win a cut in the capital gains tax rate.
   In their final budget agreement, lawmakers and the White House
agreed to keep the reductions in effect for one-third of this year,
resulting in 1.5 percent cuts in defense spending and 1.4 percent
reductions in most domestic programs. The cuts are expected to
produce $3 billion worth of savings this year.

   Down in south Louisiana, where children
grow up hearing about the voodoo queen Marie Laveau, even judges
seem to feel it's better to be safe than sorry where curses are
concerned.
   District Judge Joel Chaisson, not wanting to take any chances
with powers stronger than his, did what any born-and-bred south
Louisianian could be expected to do.
   Chaisson ordered Ronald P. Edwards, 27 of Des Allemands to
remove a curse as a tongue-in-cheek special condition of probation
on charges of simple battery and disturbing the peace.
   Edwards, who pleaded guilty to both charges Friday, was arrested
the day before after a ruckus at his house. As he was being taken
to jail, Edwards warned that he had cast a spell on the arresting
deputy sheriff and on the judge who would hear his case. Both would
become paralyzed soon, he predicted.
   In court, Chaisson asked Edwards if he practiced voodoo. Edwards
said it was just a joke.
   The judge fined him $200 and put him on a year's probation with
the curse removal as a special condition of probation.

   An all-sports shoe allowing an athlete to
change soles to play different games, super-scrub skates, and an
adjustable ski pole were some of the gadgets on hand as young
inventors got to show off their stuff.
   Other inventions on display last week at Oakdale Elementary
School were a bathwater temperature-control device and a children's
zipper tie that makes adjusting the tie easier.
   Approximately 125 Oakdale Elementary School sixth-graders
participated in the program. Those judged the best get a crack at
state and national competitions.
   ``We want the kids to have fun and use some of their
creativity,'' said sixth-grade teacher Christie Webb, the event's
organizer. ``They took a problem and thought of something to make
it easier.''
   Steve Symkoviak, 12, inventor of the all-sports shoe, explained
how screw holes in his sports shoe allow an athlete to put on
different kinds of soles for different kinds of athletic events.
``I got tired of going on a trip and having to take so many pairs
of shoes. Now I can just take one pair and the rest of the soles.''
   And here's Parker Shaw, 12, on the super-scrub skates: ``These
are a lot more fun than a mop because you can slide around and the
floor will be cleaner because the legs are stronger than the arms.
I thought of the idea when I spilled something on the floor.''
   Amberly Richards, 11, inventor of the adjustable ski pole, said
it will allow children to use the same poll as they grow, adding,
``This invention will save them a lot of money.''
   A little bit of everything was displayed, from real technical
inventions like the earthquake-proof ``anti-jar-juggler'' to
down-to-earth simple things that only a child would think of.
   ``I'm excited. This helps school be a little bit more fun,''
said Webb. ``It's neat to see some kids you have never seen the
light turn on get excited over something like this.''
   The Invent America program is a national awards program designed
to stimulate invention and creativity among children. More than
80,000 schools around the country and 31 million children and their
teachers are invited to participate nationwide.

<TEXT>
   On a drizzling night in June, Chittavoravong
Saly waded silently into the Mekong River. Stroking slowly so as
not to splash, he swam to freedom.
   Less than 11 years after escaping from his jailers in Laos,
Chittavoravong feels he is being persecuted again _ this time by
the U.S. budget ax which is threatening to eliminate his job at the
Voice of America.
   To save $3 million, the government-run radio network announced
several weeks ago it would silence six of its 43 language services:
Lao, Uzbek, Slovenian, Swahili, Greek and Turkish. Chittavoravong,
after seven years at VOA, is among the most junior of the 11 Lao
staffers near the door.
   However, the publicity generated by the announcement led VOA'S
parent, the U.S. Information Agency, to consider ways of possibly
salvaging the broadcasts by asking Congress to authorize a shifting
of funds from other VOA accounts.
   USIA ``directed us to solve the problem and find a way to keep
broadcasting,'' Robert Coonrod, VOA's deputy director, said
Saturday. Congressional approval of the funding still was
uncertain, he added.
   Chittavoravong loved listening to the VOA back in Vientiane, the
capital of the isolated Southeast Asian nation,
   Chittavoravong taught English at the Lao-American culture center
and also at a teachers college. He also taught Laotian to diplomats
at the Australian, British and U.S. embassies.
   Soon after the Communist Pathet Lao movement seized power in
1975, a truck pulled up to the teachers college. Soldiers sought
out Chittavoravong, handcuffed him and took him away.
   The slightly built teacher was accused of being a spy for the
CIA. No charges were ever brought against him and there was no
trial.
   For two and a-half years Chittavoravong shared a jail hall with
about 250 inmates, sleeping on a wooden floor with a blanket and
mosquito net as cover.
   Chittavoravong was among a favored few whose families were
allowed to bring them food once a month.
   Every night, inmates sat cross-legged on the floor in groups of
10 and conducted self-criticism sessions in which they
``confessed'' their thoughts and misdeeds of the day. Typical
``confessions'' would consist of an inmate telling how he stole a
banana from someone's food package from home.
   Once every few weeks, Chittavoravong was required to write about
his past _ sometimes at great length and sometimes in abbreviated
form. ``They were trying to confuse us, and to find
discrepancies,'' he said in an interview.
   Occasionally Chittavoravong heard gunshots, but information
about the shootings was hard to obtain. ``I tried to be a good boy.
I didn't want to be punished,'' he said.
   In a suburb of Vientiane, his mother prayed to her ancestors'
spirits for her son's release. She sacrificed pigs' heads and
pledged that if released, her son would become a monk.
   Chittavoravong's incarceration ended as abruptly as it began.
One spring day in 1979 he was told he had been ``re-educated'' and
was free to go. But Chittavoravong had by then decided to go much
farther than his suburban home. ``This system was not human,'' he
said. ``I decided it was either death or freedom.''
   First, however, he had to fulfill his mother's vow. So he shaved
his head, and entered a monastery.
   At night, lying under a blanket on his narrow cot,
Chittavoravong listened to the outlawed broadcasts of the Voice of
America. Then as now it was the only Western radio that could be
heard in the landlocked country.
   He planned his escape with the help of a relative, who drove him
to the banks of the Mekong. He was hidden by another relative until
it was deemed safe for him to attempt the swim to Thailand. He took
with him several personal documents, some Thai money, a pair of
pants and a shirt, all of which he kept dry in an inner tube.
   But his ordeal was not over yet. Upon reaching Thailand,
Chittavoravong was thrown into a small jail. He had enough money to
eventually bribe his way out and reach a U.N. refugee camp. From
there, he obtained a visa to come here.
   Now, with four children and a new mortgage, the 50-year-old
broadcaster feels his world is coming apart again. ``I don't know
what I can do. It's so sad. I love this job,'' he said.
   VOA has promised to help the laid-off employees find new jobs,
but Lao service chief Linthong Noinala is doubtful that more than
one or two can find jobs comparable to their current positions.
   Linthong, a 22-year VOA veteran whose wife died last month, is
disconsolate. ``We will survive, we will do what we have to even if
it's cooking or cleaning. But I don't understand why they are doing
this to us.''

<HEAD>Defense Chief Off to Asia for Talks With Allies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is en route to
Asia for talks in South Korea, the Philippines and Japan on such
sensitive issues as possible U.S. troop cuts and the future of
American bases in the Pacific.
   The two-week series of meetings in the three allied countries
and Hong Kong is the first such trip for Cheney as secretary of
defense.
   Cheney's goal is to consult with his counterparts before an
April 1 report to Congress on reorganizing U.S. forces in East
Asia. It is required under legislation sponsored by Sens. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va.
   Cheney has signed a long-range paper offering guidance to the
military that assumes Asian allies must take up more of the burden
of their defense. It also assumes a smaller U.S. military presence
in the Pacific, where the future of bases such as Clark and Subic
in the Philippines has come into question.
   But the document also stresses that the United States will
remain committed to the ``forward deployment'' of its forces in the
region.
   In the Philippines, President Corazon Aquino has said
negotiations on the future of the bases _ leased under an agreement
set to expire in 1991 _ might begin in March or April.
   In a recent interview with wire service reporters, Cheney said
he had ``a full range of items to discuss'' with the civilian and
military leaders on his trip, including the question of ``burden
sharing.''
   The term refers to efforts to seek funding from the allied
nations that host U.S. forces and benefit from their defense, such
as Japan, South Korea and Western Europe.
   During a time of tight budgets at home, the defense secretary
has come under severe questioning in Congress about the
administration's $292.1 billion request for Pentagon spending
during the next fiscal year.
   And even though Cheney announced in connection with his budget
that some 2,000 U.S. personnel will be withdrawn from three U.S.
Air Force bases in South Korea in an attempt to cut costs, some
lawmakers are demanding more severe draw-downs in U.S. forces
overseas.
   The issue is a delicate one for South Korea, a nation that hosts
43,000 U.S. troops under a mutual defense pact. U.S. forces fought
on the South Korean side after the Communist North invaded to start
the 1950-53 Korean War.
   Cheney said that Alan Holmes, a State Department
ambassador-at-large who deals with burden sharing ``will be with us
for part of the trip'' and that he intends ``to talk with our
allies about the subject.''
   The secretary will visit South Korea on Feb. 14-17; Hong Kong
Feb. 17-18; the Philippines on Feb. 18-20 and Japan from Feb. 20-24.
   At each stop except Hong Kong, Cheney is to meet with the U.S.
forces stationed there, and he plans to review host nation forces
in Korea, the Philippines and Japan.
   A senior Defense Department official, briefing reporters on the
trip on condition he not be identified by name, said there will be
no announcements of troop cuts during Cheney's visits.
   And while Cheney intends to discuss the future of the strategic
U.S. bases in the Philippines, he does not intend to enter into any
kind of negotiations about them, the official said.
   ``This is not the first stage of negotiations. Secretary Cheney
is not taking any message'' about the upcoming talks, the official
said.
   Before traveling to South Korea, Cheney planned a three-night
stop in Hawaii for talks with Adm. Huntington Hardisty, the top
military man in the Pacific, and visits with U.S. troops at several
military bases there.

   Here is the text of the joint Soviet-American
statement released Saturday by the Soviet news agency Tass
following the visit of Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III met Feb. 7-9 in Moscow as part of the
preparations for the Soviet-U.S. summit to be held in June in the
United States.
   Proceeding from their common goal of building a more stable,
constructive and cooperative relationship, they reviewed the broad
range of issues on the Soviet-U.S. agenda. The secretary also was
received by Chairman Gorbachev for an open, wide-ranging exchange
of views.
   The foreign minister and the secretary discussed developments in
Soviet-U.S. relations since the Wyoming ministerial and the Malta
meeting between Chairman Gorbachev and President Bush. They
examined the prospects for the summit, with the particular aim of
advancing the objectives and priorities defined by the two leaders
in Malta.
   The foreign minister and the secretary noted with satisfaction
the progress that is being made in Soviet-U.S. relations. While
certain significant differences remain between the sides, their
relationship is increasingly marked by understanding, cooperation
and the search for mutual advantage.
   The foreign minister and the secretary believe that candid
dialogue and continuing efforts at finding practical and concrete
solutions will further the significant progress that has been
recorded to date.
   In this context, the Moscow ministerial was a useful and
important step in preparing the ground for a productive summit. The
high-level discussions were complemented by experts working groups
on arms control, regional, human rights, transnational and
bilateral issues, as well as an informal group on economic
questions.
   Specific agreements were reached in several areas of the agenda.
The foreign minister and the secretary held a thorough exchange of
views on arms control and disarmament issues. With respect to the
treaty on the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms,
they reaffirmed their common objective of resolving all major
issues by the June summit in order to allow signature of the treaty
by the end of the year.
   To further this goal, the sides reached agreement or exchanged
new proposals in a number of areas.
   On air-launched cruise missiles, the sides made substantial
progress on a package approach, agreeing on all remaining issues
with the exception of the range threshold.
   The sides also made good progress on sea-launched cruise
missiles. The sides agreed that such missiles would be dealt with
by parallel, politically binding declarations for the duration of
the START treaty.
   The foreign minister and the secretary agreed that the remaining
issues involving SLCMs would be addressed at the negotiations in
Geneva.
   The sides agreed that there would be numerical limits on
non-deployed ballistic missiles and the warheads attributable to
them for all ICBMs of a type that has been flight tested from a
mobile launcher. Other non-deployed heavy bomber weapons will not
be subject to numerical limits.
   The sides further agreed on a regime governing the location and
movement of all non-deployed ballistic missiles. The sides reached
agreement on major elements of a regime to ensure the non-denial of
telemetry data during flight tests of START-accountable ballistic
missiles.
   These provisions will be included in the START treaty, but will
be implemented early, at the time of treaty signature, through an
exchange of letters.
   The U.S. side presented new proposals on verification of mobile
ICBMs, duration of the treaty, phasing of reductions, and
attribution of warheads to future types of ballistic missiles. The
Soviet side presented new proposals dealing with non-circumvention.
   The foreign minister and the secretary instructed their
negotiators to discuss these new proposals and to expedite efforts
on resolving remaining differences in the text of the treaty and
its associated documents.
   The sides discussed the Vienna negotiations on conventional
force reductions and reiterated their determination to conclude an
agreement as soon as possible in 1990.
   The sides discussed President Bush's Jan. 31 proposal on
manpower which was presented by NATO in Vienna on Feb. 8, as well
as NATO's aircraft proposal presented on the same date.
   As a result of the discussions in Moscow, the differences on
personnel were narrowed. The sides agreed to continuetheir
discussions in the context of the negotiations in Vienna and at the
ministers' meeting on open skies in Ottawa.
   The foreign minister and the secretary had extensive discussions
on how to proceed toward their common goal of achieving, through
the negotiations in Geneva, a global ban on the development,
production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and of their
destruction.
   The Soviet and U.S. delegations in Geneva were instructed to
proceed with developing means of practical cooperation in the area
of chemical weapons elimination. The sides issued a separate, more
detailed statement on chemical weapons.
   In discussions on nuclear testing, the sides made progress on
resolving the remaining issues. They believe that the task of
completing the verification protocols to the 1974 and 1975
threshold limitation treaties for signing at the summit is
realistic.
   The sides agreed on the right to simultaneous use of
hydrodynamic and in-country seismic yield measurements. The sides
also resolved several longstanding problems regarding the
implementation of the hydrodynamic yield measurement method. The
sides identified the three seismic stations in each country to be
used for in-country seismic yield measurements.
   The sides reaffirmed their adherence to the agreement reached in
September 1987 with regard to the negotiations on nuclear testing.
   The Foreign Minister and the Secretary expressed their hope that
the Ottawa open skies conference _ which they will both attend _
would be a success and lead to early agreement They believe an open
skies regime can make a genuine contribution to openness,
transparency and stability.
   The foreign minister and the secretary noted the recent
consultations between their experts on chemical weapons
non-proliferation, missile technology control and nuclear
non-proliferation. They agreed to prepare a document for
consideration by their leaders covering both principles and
concrete steps of cooperation in all areas of non-proliferation _
chemical, missile and nuclear.
   The sides conducted a discussion of the problem of
non-proliferation of missiles and missile technology. They noted
that they both adhere to the export guidelines of the existing
regime relating to missiles, which applies to missiles capable of
delivering at least 500 kilograms of payload to a range of at least
300 kilometers. They further agreed to continue joint discussions
on this problem in the interim before the next ministerial.

<TEXT>
   Here is a text of the question
and answer session of President F.W. de Klerk's news conference on
Saturday announcing that black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela
would be freed. The text was provided to The Associated Press by
the president's office.
   QUESTION: Do you believe this now fulfills all the preconditions
for the U.S.A. and other countries to lift sanctions against South
Africa?
   DE KLERK: We are not working against checklists. We are doing
what we sincerely believe to be in the best interests of South
Africa. Obviously, there are still some of the preconditions which
have been set by various sources which have not literally been met,
but the most important stumbling blocks in the way of negotiation,
in the way of positive developments to create a climate for
negotiation, have now been addressed to my mind.
   QUESTION: Mr. President, will the state lend security personnel
and apparatus to ensure Mr. Mandela's safety, and secondly, do you
expect that he will depart tomorrow for his home in Soweto?
   DE KLERK: The question of security and the actual process of
release is that which is being discussed now with interested
parties by officials of the government. The state will secure the
position of Mr. Mandela while he is in custody of the state. As
regards the rest of your question, when Mr. Mandela is released he
becomes a free man and he does not owe it to me to inform us of his
program. I have not asked him about it either.
   QUESTION: Mr. President, you said that Mr. Mandela has committed
himself to a peaceful solution in South Africa. Does that mean that
he now officially rejects violence?
   DE KLERK: I do not intend to speak on behalf of Mr. Mandela this
afternoon. He will be able to do so tomorrow.
   QUESTION: A number of people who have met with Mr. Mandela since
your original meeting, have spoken about it very positively and
about the chemistry that exists between you and him. I wonder if
you can tell us about your impressions of him and give us some kind
of idea of the exchanges that you have had.
   DE KLERK: The discussions really took place in a very civil
atmosphere. He is a friendly man. I would like to think that I am
also a friendly man. Yes, the discussions really took place in good
spirit. He is an elderly, dignified man and he is an interesting
man.
   QUESTION: Mr. President, the minister of constitutional
development said that the state of emergency could be lifted within
weeks. Is that a fair assessment on your part now after meeting
with Mr. Mandela?
   DE KLERK: As it is clearly stated in my statement, the final
test is the situation on the ground, and everything will depend
upon the question whether we get an increase in unrest or whether
we get a decrease in unrest.
   QUESTION: Mr. President, Mr. Mandela has made clear over the
past few weeks that he was uncomfortable being released in a
situation where the state of emergency was still in force and not
all political prisoners had been freed. What was his reaction to
you informing him of his release into those conditions?
   DE KLERK: Once again, I really do not want to speak on his
behalf. I can only give impressions and I went to great lengths to
explain why the situation is as it is with regard to the state of
emergency and that partiular question you must ask him tomorrow.
   QUESTION: Mr. De Klerk, how are you going to release Mr.
Mandela? Are you going to release him from the prison straight into
freedom, or are you going to take him away?
   DE KLERK: That is part of the process that is being discussed by
officials now. I won't be present, and I do not intend to interfere
in the detail.
   QUESTION: You spoke of an increase or decrease in violence. What
judgement or basis are you going to use for determining whether you
feel there has indeed been the right climate established for doing
away with the regulations?
   DE KLERK: Well, obviously, any government has sources of
information available to it. It is official sources, reports from
its security forces, its police wherever they are, factual reports
which come in regularly, which are all assimilated at one central
point, analyzed and studied. We deal with such things in a very
scientific manner, and we know what is going on in every corner of
the country.
   QUESTION: What I meant, sir: You know that you are going to be
subjected to some considerable scrutiny. Is there some sort of norm
that you have established that you can set out for us now as to
what would constitute stability.

<HEAD>CAPE TOWN: constitute stability.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   DE KLERK: Stability is stability. Stability is a situation where
people can feel safe, where people who want to go to work can do
so, where people can live a normal life without intimidation,
without threat. Stability is a situation where you do not have
arson in a country because of political debate and differences.
Stability is a situation where you do not have deaths as a result
of political strife. That is the sort of stability we are striving
for. Obviously, in any country, at all times, you have crimes and
we go to great lengths to draw the necessary distinctions between
ordinary and politically related instability.
   QUESTION: Mr. President, when you talk about a fair and just
preliminary to negotiations, will you go beyond the state of
emergency, and discuss as well the negotiation process, the
establishment of full citizenship rights for the Black people of
South Africa?
   DE KLERK: Thank you for that question. We have just won an
election stating that as our goal. That is the mandate that my
party asked of the electorate and that is the mandate that we
received. There is a misconception that we do not want to give full
citizenship rights to all South Africans, also to black South
Africans. As a matter of fact, we have already received such a
mandate from the white electorate in an election in 1989.
   It is no longer a question whether all South Africans must get
full citizenship rights. The question is how to structure it, how
also to accommodate the diversity in a non-discriminatory manner,
of our total population. The fact that we have minorities, but
nonetheless that clear commitment is the system must give full
class-A citizenships to all South Africans, irrespective of race or
color.
   DE KLERK: Once again, I do not want to speak on his behalf.
   QUESTION: Mr. President, while in custody, Mr. Mandela indicated
that he would act as an intermediary or facilitator between the
government and the ANC. Do you expect to continue to deal with him
now on that basis?
   DE KLERK: I follow an open-door policy and should come forward
and should he be prepared to play the role of facilitator, to
interest himself in promoting a climate for negotiation, should he
interest himself in promoting talks, even talks about talks, yes,
that open door is also open to him.
   QUESTION: President De Klerk, I was wondering whether the
presence of the Rev. Jackson here in South Africa had anything to
do with the release of Mandela? (Laughter).
   DE KLERK: As far as the release of Mr. Mandela is concerned, his
presence is totally irrelevant.
   QUESTION: President, can I ask you: did Mr. Mandela give you any
assurance that he would call for peace in this country?
   DE KLERK: I did not ask him.
   QUESTION: President, from your last reply, when you said that he
is prepared to act as a facilitator, does that mean he has not
given you his agreement to enter negotiation?
   DE KLERK: His willingness to act as a facilitator has been
published widely and over a fairly long period now. I did not
discuss it with him as such again last night.
   QUESTION: Mr. De Klerk, could you possibly describe Mr.
Mandela's reaction when you told him he would be released tomorrrow?
   DE KLERK: I do not think that I would like to try to do that
   QUESTION: Returning to the question of the lifting of the state
of emergency, the stability required, does this imply that you will
wait until there is complete peace in the Natal province, and do
you think that that realistically will happen within the few weeks
time that some of your ministers have given as a time span for that
lifting?
   DE KLERK: There is an element of uncertainty, obviously, with
regard to everything which lies in the future. None of us can
exactly say what will happen tomorrow and the day after. It is
really our hope that with the steps which we have taken, that it
will make a contribution and that will bring us soon to the
situation where it can be considered. We review this situation
almost on an ongoing basis, almost on a day-to-day basis, and we
are as anxious as anybody else to have the state of emergency
lifted as soon as possible.
   QUESTION: You said that the lifting of the state of emergency
would be a matter for negotiations. With whom do you propose to
negotiate? Mr. Mandela, the ANC, who?
   DE KLERK: No, I did not say that is matter for negotiation. I
said that the question of political prisoners is a matter for
negotiation. The state of emergency was imposed by the government
because of a state of instability throughout our country. It will
be a government decision to lift it, and the test will be whether
the stability has been restored sufficiently so that we can do so.
   QUESTION: But you did say that you have discussed it with Mr.
Mandela, didn't you?
   DE KLERK: Yes, obviously, because it is a matter which is being
raised from many quarters as also being a stumbling block, and in
that sense it was discussed.
   QUESTION: Mr. President, may I ask you: have you already or are
you about to inform world leaders, and if so, whom?
   DE KLERK: I have informed our minister of foreign affairs a few
hours ago and in all probability he has undertaken an exercise so
that they will not just read it in the press. It is general custom,
which we adhere to, and that I am sure he has done. I did not speak
to anybody.
   QUESTION: Are you, sir, concerned at all for the safety of
Nelson Mandela, and if so, how?
   DE KLERK: Yes, in my opening address, or rather, in another
statement I indicated that, yes, I think there is reason for
concern about his safety. There are all sorts of people who might
threaten his life. I think radicals from the very far left might be
tempted to do so, and I think there is also a risk that it might
come from radicalists from the right. Many publicc figures are
being threatened throughout the world almost in all countries, and
with him having such a high profile, I think, yes, there is a real
risk, and one must take every precaution to ensure that noghing
happens to him. But when he leaves prison, then he will be moving
to his own circle of friends, and in all probability, as in the
case of Mr. Sisulu and the other prisoners which we released, there
was no request to the state to give any assistance with regard to
their security.
   QUESTION: Mr. President, I wonder if I may ask you to define the
mandate? How do you define full constitutional rights? Is that one
man, one vote?
   DE KLERK: Can we save that for the press conference of next
week? That is the type of thing I would likee to address then.
Thank you very much.

<HEAD>Deputies Nab Alleged Milk Money Pincher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LACOOCHEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy who allegedly
threatened to beat up five elementary school classmates unless they
forked over their milk money has been arrested and charged with
felony extortion, authorities said Saturday.
   The boy, not identified because of his age, was arrested
Thursday at Lacoochee Elementary School after the parents of one
pupil told Assistant Principal Ky Grand that her son was afraid to
go to school.
   Grand said the charges were serious enough to call in sheriff's
deputies instead of dealing with the incident within the school.
   Upon further investigation by school officials and Pasco County
sheriff's deputies, five students said the boy threatened to beat
them up if they did not give him money they brought to school to
buy milk and ice cream.
   The boy admitted taking money and was arrested Thursday on five
extortion charges. He was released to the custody of his mother.
   He was suspended from school for three days and may face
expulsion, said principal Renee Sedlack, who said the boy
previously has not been a disciplinary problem.

   About 20,000 East Germans, many carrying West
German flags, demonstrated Saturday for speedy German
reunification, the official East German news agency ADN said.
   As the demonstrators rallied in the southern city of Plauen,
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had given him an unequivocal promise
to respect German reunification. Kohl declared it a ``very good day
for Germany.''
   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also disclosed
that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the World
War II Allies to be ready before the end of the year for
presentation to a pan-European summit meeting.
   Calls for German reunification have increased since the ouster
of the hard-line Communist leadership and the opening of East
Germany's borders during the fall pro-democracy movement.
   Despite reforms, nearly 2,000 East Germans, most of them skilled
workers, continue to leave their homeland daily, crippling an
economy already troubled by strikes and absenteeism.
   Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said
the East German economy was in a ``sorrowful state'' and urged the
East German government to release details on its financial
situation.
   Waigel's comments came after a day after a high-ranking official
in Bonn warned that East Germany is rapidly approaching insolvency.
   ``Things are escalating,'' Waigel said in an interview with West
Berlin radio. ``The economy is in a sorrowful state. The political
authority is crumbling.''
   He said the Bonn government believes East Germany's foreign debt
stands at $18 billion.
   ``If the situation has changed, the East German government must
say so,'' said Waigel, a conservative who has been pushing for
establishment of a common currency for the two states.
   Also Saturday, more than 100 East Germans protested in front of
the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin against the stationing of Soviet
helicopters in their country, ADN said.
   ADN said the demonstrators held signs saying ``Gorbi, what about
disarmament?'' and ``Tanks out, helicopters in?''
   The protesters, from the East German town of Prenzlau, claimed
the Soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank
unit that had been stationed at a military base there with
helicopters, ADN reported.
   According to ADN, the demonstrators, who came from church and
citizens' groups as well as from the town council, issued a
statement calling for civilian use of the base.
   Prenzlau, a town of 22,000, is located about 50 miles north of
Berlin.

<HEAD>NASA Sets Feb. 22 Launch Date for Space Shuttle Atlantis</HEAD>

   Space Shuttle Atlantis will lift off
early on the morning of Feb. 22 on a secret military mission, NASA
announced Saturday.
   Shuttle managers said after a two-day flight readiness review
that the launch would occur between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m., the fourth
after-dark liftoff in 34 shuttle missions.
   Feb. 22 has been the target date for some time, and the review
turned up nothing to change that. ``There are no significant
problems standing in the way of launch,'' said a NASA statement.
   Replacement of a main engine turbopump had threatened a one-day
delay, but that work was completed Saturday without affecting the
schedule.
   Because Atlantis' payload is classified, the Pentagon and NASA
will not announce the precise launch time until nine minutes before
blastoff to make it harder for Soviet satellites and reconnaissance
ships sitting offshore to track the spaceship.
   However, sources close to the project said Atlantis and its crew
of five military officers are to take off at 1:14 a.m.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said the
shuttle's payload is a 37,300-pound satellite with a dual role to
snap high-resolution reconnaissance photos and eavesdrop on
military and diplomatic communications.
   They said the payload will be launched into a high-inclination
orbit that will cover most of the Soviet Union, including northern
areas not previously overflown by shuttle-launched spy satellites.
The Russians have heavy concentrations of naval ships and
submarines and several missile bases in the far north.
   The satellite, known by the code name AFP-731, was loaded into
Atlantis' cargo bay early Saturday.
   The crew for the four-day mission is commanded by Navy Capt.
John O. Creighton. The others are Air Force Col. John H. Casper,
the pilot, and the mission specialists, Marine Lt. Col. David C.
Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Pierre J. Thuot.
   Creighton, Hilmers and Mullane have flown on previous shuttle
missions.

<HEAD>Right-to-Die Group Shakes Up Amid Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than a year after helping his first
wife take her own life so she would not die a slow, painful death
from cancer, Derek Humphry married again.
   With his new wife, Ann, he founded the Hemlock Society, an
organization that became a leader in the right-to-die movement.
   But after Ann W. Humphry was diagnosed with breast cancer last
year, the couple became embroiled in a bitter divorce that has left
Mrs. Humphry accusing her estranged husband of abandoning the
society's most basic principles as well as abusing his leadership.
   ``It's a tragic case of a lot of dirty linen being washed in
public,'' said William Batt, a director of the national
organization and president of the society's upstate New York
chapter.
   Last month, the society's board of directors restructured the
organization. It voted both Humphrys off the board, appointed Derek
Humphry executive director and placed Ann Humphry on sick leave.
   The board expressed full confidence in Derek Humphry. Board
member Faye Girsh of San Diego said, ``It's his vision.''
   The moves were long overdue, board members said. ``It was really
a mom-and-pop organization,'' board member John Westover of Tucson,
Ariz., said last week. ``It had really outgrown the situation.''
   In fact, the board would like someone else to take over
administrative duties so that Derek Humphry can devote himself to
developing policy and spreading the society's message, Westover said
   The intertwined story of Derek and Ann Humphry and the Hemlock
Society began when they were married 13 years ago in England. He
was a British journalist. She was an American academic.
   In 1978 they moved to Los Angeles, where they founded the
Hemlock Society in 1980 to crusade for the right to choose death,
as Humphry's first wife, Jean, had done.
   The Humphrys moved Hemlock in 1988 to Eugene, Ore., where the
national organization employs 13 people and counts 53 chapters
across the United States.
   Ann Humphry bought a 50-acre farm in Monroe, 20 miles north of
Eugene, where the couple lived until last October. Three weeks
after she was diagnosed with breast cancer, Derek Humphry went on a
speaking tour in New Mexico and never came home again.
   ``She wouldn't let me have anything to do with her cancer,''
said Humphry, 59. ``She wouldn't let me come to the hospital. She
wouldn't tell me the details. She said, `You stay out of it.'''
   He said his wife finally changed her mind, but began to taunt
him about his previous wife.
   ``Would I do the same for her? Did I love her as much as my
first wife? .... Things were said that I could not bear. The
marriage just broke to pieces in my eyes and I left her.
   ``It was a bad marriage for four or five years,'' he said. ``The
cancer just cracked it open. The cancer just finished it off.''
   Ann Humphry acknowledged that the couple had been seeing
marriage counselors.
   She said she had been growing more distant from both her husband
and the Hemlock Society in recent years and the cancer was the
final straw.
   ``I think it was a terrible blow to him,'' she said. ``He said,
`I cannot live with this misery any longer. I don't choose to live
through what I lived through once.' He added that if I were dying,
he would make certain that I would be looked after.''
   Derek Humphry said the point was she was not dying, that the
lump had been removed from her breast in time, and her physician
gave her a 75 percent chance of recovery.
   In addition, Ann Humphry said she believed her husband has hurt
the right-to-die movement.
   ``The Hemlock Society has in its thesis that anyone with a
life-threatening illness should be provided a nurturing and
supportive environment,'' she said. ``It is ironic that its leader
left his wife three weeks after she was diagnosed and had surgery
for her cancer.
   She and others, she said, brought to the board's attention what
they called serious tax abuses under Humphry's leadership.
   She said money was transferred from the society, an educational
non-profit organization, to politically active organizations, a
tax-law violation.
   Humphry said the money was loaned to a group pushing for a
right-to-die ballot initiative in California and the IRS questioned
it.
   Humphry said there is a genuine difference of opinion over
whether the transfers were legally proper.
   Members of the board of directors agreed.
   ``This is something that was done in consultation with
attorneys,'' said Batt, who works as a tax policy analyst for the
New York Legislature. ``This is not a case of one person blowing a
whistle. It is a difference among experts.''

   World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement
Saturday of Nelson Mandela's impending release from prison, and
international rejoicing began to build for an event so long awaited
by so many.
   Britain said it was time to resume contacts with the
internationally isolated Pretoria government, but anti-apartheid
campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure on South
Africa's white-led government.
   President Bush praised South African President F.W. de Klerk for
``bold and imaginative leadership,'' and the Canadian government
expressed delight at the announcement Mandela would be released
Sunday.
   In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth Launda, whose country has
been a refuge for the exiled leadership of Mandela's African
National Congress, said his first reaction was to kneel down and
thank God.
   ``Really, we must believe in the leadership of the people of
South Africa to put their heads together and build on these
developments,'' Kaunda said.
   Mandela's release will enable ANC leaders to ``begin talking
across color and any other artificial barriers,'' Kaunda said.
``Those things such as police brutality we can expect from time to
time, but the main thing is that the entire leadership should get
together.''
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962 for leading the ANC into a
guerrilla campaign against the white-dominated government's policy
of apartheid, which denies the black majority the right to vote.
   On Feb. 2, De Klerk stunned South Africans by lifting a 30-year
ban on the ANC, ending bans and restrictions on dozens of
opposition groups, scrapping some state-of-emergency regulations
and declaring a moratorium on hangings.
   Hours after the announcement of Mandela's release date, the
ANC's leadership announced from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia:
``We welcome Nelson Mandela back from all those years of
imprisonment into our midst with great joy.''
   ANC executive committee member James Stuart predicted Mandela
would ``probably concentrate on mobilizing our people and the unity
of our people,'' and will ``participate in all kinds of activities
which will march foward toward the end of the apartheid system.''
   ``Ireland rejoices that Nelson Mandela is free at last,'' said
Charles Haughey, Irish prime minister and current president of the
European Economic Community, which has been using economic
sanctions to pressure Pretoria to give up apartheid.
   ``By his indomitable courage he has demonstrated once again that
the human spirit can never be vanquished,'' Haughey said.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, sent Mandela a message of
congratulation, praising the ``sacrifices of the great people of
South Africa'' and assuring him of Egyptian solidarity with his
cause.
   In the Soviet Union, Moscow radio broadcast news of the
announcement, then added, ``Nelson Mandela has become the world's
most famous political prisoner, put in jail for the struggle
against apartheid in South Africa.''
   Amsterdam's central Leidseplein square was temporarily
rechristened Nelson Mandela Square.
   In London, a jubilant crowd of about 120, some waving pictures
of Mandela, celebrated in the pouring rain outside South Africa
House in Trafalgar Square.
   In a statement released by her 10 Downing St. office, Mrs.
Thatcher said, ``We believe that the steps President de Klerk has
taken merit a positive, practical response.''
   ``We believe it no longer makes sense to discourage new
investment in South Africa _ a restraint which in our case in any
event has been voluntary _ and we shall be discussing this with our
EC partners,'' she said.
   In 1986, the EC banned imports of South African iron, steel and
Kruggerand gold coins, and barred new investment in the country. It
had already frozen scientific and cultural relations.
   Britain regards the iron, steel and coin embargoes as mandatory,
but not the investment ban, and has already announced that it is no
longer observing the scientific and cultural embargo.
   In a statement released from the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md., Bush said: ``I welcome this move and view it as another
significant step on the road to the non-racial, democratic South
Africa which we all desire.''
   Bush reiterated his intention to invite Mandela and de Klerk to
the White House in separate visits, and said: ``President de Klerk
has shown bold and imaginative leadership in recent days which has
earned the admiration of many of us who hope for swift and peaceful
evolution in South Africa.''
   In London, Bob Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement,
said he was delighted at the news, which he called ``a tremendous
victory for the people of South Africa and for the international
sanctions campaign.''
   Commonwealth Secretary-General Sir Shridath Ramphal said
Mandela's safety must be guaranteed by the South African government
and that until change there became irreversible, the Commonwealth
would sustain its pressure for apartheid's end. ``It is not yet
time to demobilize the international support for apartheid's
victims,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Troops of Gen. Michel Aoun captured a
strategic town Saturday that was a stronghold of rival Christian
forces and opened a new front in the war for control of Lebanon's
Christian region, police said.
   A communique from Aoun's command said his soldiers took 34
prisoners in the attack on Kleiat, 15 miles northeast of Beirut in
the mountainous province of Kesrouan. The rival Lebanese Forces
militia claimed its fighters counterattacked and drove back Aoun's
men.
   ``The battle for Kesrouan has begun,'' said a police spokesman
who could not be named under standing rules. ``Kleiat's capture
opens the way for Aoun's army to punch deep into the region.''
   If Aoun's forces are able to oust the Lebanese Forces from
Kesrouan, that would enable them to attack the important port of
Jounieh from Dbaye in the south and Kesrouan in the north. Aoun
fighters seized Dbaye last week.
   Jounieh is the largest Lebanese Forces base in the embattled
Christian enclave and the militia's main harbor.
   There was no updated word on casualties. Before the news from
Kleiat, the toll from the 12-day confrontation between Aoun's army
and the Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea was 433 killed and
1,684 wounded.
   The intra-Christian fighting is the worst in Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun and Geagea both have been at odds with Syria, which
maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate, but Aoun has accused Geagea of trying to enforce an Arab
League-brokered peace plan that he opposed.
   Aoun attacked the pact because it set no date for the withdrawal
of the Syrian troops.
   Geagea's headquarters said his militiamen in Kleiat retreated
Saturday ``to draw in and contain Aoun's attacking force and then
counterattacked.''
   ``We drove them back in a nine-hour battle. They left behind
five destroyed tanks and 15 armored personnel carriers,'' said the
communique.
   The police spokesman refused to comment on the conflicting
claims.
   Both sides dueled with howitzers, mortars and machine guns all
day in Beirut's Christian sector. Snipers prevented rescuers from
retrieving bodies, and corpses were left to rot on the streets.
   ``Civil defense rescuers believe some of the corpses are
booby-trapped and that's why the combatants want to keep them
there,'' a police spokesman said.
   A police spokesman said three people were killed and four
wounded in the shelling before it subsided into intermittent
exchanges around 10 a.m.
   The shelling broke out when a unit of Geagea's 6,000-man militia
used dynamite to blast the Daraya Bridge, northeast of Beirut, and
block any possible tank attack by Aoun's 19,000 troops.
   Aoun's gunners shelled the militia squad as it was returning to
base, and Geagea's men responded.
   Hundreds of civilians fled the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
to safe areas in west Beirut, south, east and north Lebanon.
   The blasting of the Daraya Bridge came two days after Geagea's
militia blocked with rocks, concrete and mines a 500-yard tunnel on
the coastal highway linking Aoun's territory with Kesrouan.
   Aoun's command issued a communique saying Geagea's militia, by
blowing up the Daraya Bridge, violated a cease-fire called two days
ago.
   Shortly before dusk, Aoun's Radio Lebanon said Geagea's gunners
were shelling the general's Defense Ministry in Yarze, east of
Beirut.
   The police spokesman said the situation in the Christian enclave
``does not indicate that a cease-fire's going to hold.''
   The Voice of Lebanon, an anti-Aoun Christian radio station that
is the mouthpiece of the Phalange party, reported a mutiny among
Aoun's troops as they and Geagea's militia appeared geared for
another round of all-out fighting.
   The station broadcast a statement by Col. Paul Faris, who
declared creation of the ``neutral army forces'' with headquarters
in the coastal town of Amsheet, which is controlled by Geagea
forces.
   He urged ``fellow soldiers ... to refuse Aoun's orders and
immediately join the ranks of the neutral army forces. Leave Aoun's
army now before it's too late.''
   Addressing the 54-year-old Aoun, Faris said: ``You are a
criminal general ... responsible for all the massacres being
committed against your people. The least you deserve is execution
by a firing squad.''
   Shortly after broadcasting Faris' communique, Voice of Lebanon
said it received calls from several army units declaring support
for the mutiny. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
   Aoun's command released a statement that called Faris ``a
mutineer who had joined the gunmen a while ago and is wanted by
justice.''
   It said ``those declaring support for Faris are prisoners
captured by the gunmen in the early days of the battle.''
   A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Faris' mutiny ``is obviously coordinated with Geagea ... to make it
easier for Aoun's men to defect to a Christian army command''
rather than taking ``the tough decision'' of declaring loyalty to
the Syrian-backed command of Gen. Emile Lahoud.
   Lahoud, who has headquarters in west Beirut, commands the 22,000
predominantly Moslem soldiers who are based in Syrian-controlled
territories of Lebanon.

   A senior Bush administration official said
Saturday night the United States is backing nothing less than full
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for a united
Germany.
   ``Membership, membership, membership,'' said the official,
countering reports that the administration had some other scheme in
mind.
   The reports followed an assertion by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III at a news conference in Moscow on Friday night that U.S.
policy calls for membership or ``association'' in the western
alliance for a reunited Germany.
   At the same news conference, Baker said he meant nothing special
by using the word ``association.''
   Asked about the reports, the senior U.S. official, briefing
reporters on Baker's visit here under rules that barred use of his
name, said only ``full membership'' is what the administration is
calling for.
   Both Baker and the official endorsed, meanwhile, a proposal by
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher that while a
united Germany should be a NATO member, western trops would not
move into the territory that is now East Germany.

<HEAD>Superpowers Announce Preliminary Chemical Arms Reduction Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The superpowers on Saturday announced preliminary
agreement on a U.S. plan for a 10-year phase-out of their chemical
weapons stockpiles that links their total elimination to a
negotiated worldwide ban.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told a news
conference after three days of talks with U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III that the superpowers reached accord on the draft
of ``a prospective agreement of principle.''
   ``We believe such an agreement could be signed during President
Gorbachev's visit to the United States,'' he added.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is to travel to Washington in
June to meet with President Bush.
   The announcement had been expected after the lengthy talks Baker
had with Shevardnadze and Gorbachev in Moscow.
   In a joint statement, carried by the official Soviet news agency
Tass, the United States and Soviet Union pledged to work out an
agreement for destruction of a ``significant part'' of their
chemical arsenals. The agreed reductions would put their stocks at
equally low levels while 40-nation talks on a worldwide ban
continue in Geneva.
   When an international ban on the development, production, use
and possession of chemical weapons enters into force, the United
States and Soviet Union will further cut stocks to ``a very small
fraction'' of current arsenals over an eight-year period, the
statement said.
   In the following two years, remaining U.S. and Soviet chemical
weapons would be destroyed, it said.
   The statement said all states capable of manufacturing chemical
weapons must adhere to the convention, indicating that if any third
country refused to join a ban the superpowers would not be
obligated to liquidate their remaining stockpiles.
   Only the United States and Soviet Union admit to having chemical
weapons, although a dozen nations, including Libya and Iraq, are
thought to have production capability.
   The Geneva conference negotiating a global chemical weapons ban
opened its 1990 session Wednesday. The conference dates to 1968.
Diplomats for years have forecast an agreement soon, although
progress in separate bilateral U.S.-Soviet talks that began five
years ago have now spurred optimism that a treaty might be signed
within a year.
   In December, the superpowers exchanged confidential data on the
size of their arsenals. The chief Soviet negotiator at the Geneva
negotiations, Sergei Batsanov, said last month there was ``no
surprise,'' implying his country believes it backed up its public
claim that it has no more than 50,000 tons of chemical arms.
   Some U.S. analysts, however, have said the Soviet arsenal is
more than six times larger than that. Batsanov's former U.S.
counterpart at the Geneva talks, Max Friedersdorf, said in December
the Soviets have ``considerably more than 50,000 tons.'' U.S.
stockpiles are estimated at 30,000 tons.
   In September, Bush offered to destroy 80 percent of the U.S.
chemical arsenal before an international treaty is reached if
Moscow follows suit. The Soviets, however, said then such
reductions should be accompanied by a halt to production of new
chemical weapons.
   That demand would put an end to the U.S. program to replace part
of its obsolete stockpile with modern ``binary'' chemical weapons
composed of two relatively harmless agents that become dangerous
when mixed.
   The U.S.-Soviet statement issued Saturday said only that the
international treaty should provide for a halt to production of new
chemical weapons, meaning U.S. manufacture of binaries could
continue until such a pact enters into force.

   On Central America, the foreign minister and the secretary
reaffirmed the importance of implementing all aspects of the
Esquipulas Treaty and its successor agreements.
   The sides had a constructive discussion on the conditions for a
political settlement in Afghanistan, including the need for a
transition period that provides for an intra-Afghan dialogue, a
broad-based government.
   The foreign minister and the secretary discussed the Pacific and
northeast Asia. They expressed a desire to reduce tensions on the
Korean Peninsula and to support a south-north dialogue, reiterated
their willingness to facilitate the achievement of a comprehensive
political settlement in Cambodia.
   The foreign minister and the secretary reaffirmed the need for
an active Middle East peace process, including efforts being made
to launch a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, leading to a
comprehensive political settlement in which all relevant parties
participate on the basis of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242
and 338.
   The sides again urged a political solution to the Iran-Iraq
conflict based on the full implementation of Security Council
resolution 598.
   The foreign minister and the secretary noted with satisfaction
the course of developments in Namibia aimed at establishing its
full independence under democratic conditions in peace and
stability. They urged the cessation of hostilities and negotiations
between the parties with a view to achieving a lasting political
settlement.
   The sides also expressed their concern with the growing threat
of famine in Ethiopia and urged that the international community
again come together to address this tragic humanitarian problem.
   Discussing the developments in Europe, the sides reaffirmed the
key role being played by the CSCE process in the emergence of a new
Europe. They agreed in principle on holding a summit meeting of the
35 CSCE states in 1990.
   The foreign minister and the secretary and their experts held a
thorough and very positive discussion of human rights and
humanitarian and transnational issues.
   Eduard Shevardnadze and James Baker agreed to hold their next
meeting in Washington.

   President Bush telephoned President F.W. de
Klerk on Saturday to praise his planned release of imprisoned black
activist Nelson Mandela and pledge ``U.S. willingness to help
create a climate for negotiations'' between black and white South
Africans, an aide said.
   De Klerk's announcement that Mandela would be set free on Sunday
opens the way for lifting of U.S. sanctions against Pretoria, one
administration official said.
   During their five-minute conversation Bush invited de Klerk to
meet with him at the White House and told him he was issuing the
same invitation to Mandela, said White House spokesman John Herrick.
   ``He also expressed his admiration for the significant
initiatives anounced by the South African government in recent
days, and reiterated his hope there would be continued progress
toward a negotiated solution in an atmosphere of non-violence,''
Herrick said of the call Bush made from the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md.
   Bush was joined at Camp David by Vice President Dan Quayle,
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and NATO Secretary
General Manfred Woerner. The four discussed changes in East-West
relations and th future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``President Bush stated U.S. willingness to help create a
climate for negotiations, and his plan to continue meeting with a
broad spectrum of South African leaders,'' Herrick said of the call
to de Klerk.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Sofia,
Bulgaria, where he met with government and opposition leaders,
said: ``I think that's really a very significant move by the South
African government. Let's hope that this is a step on the road to a
Democatic nonracial government in South Africa.''
   ``President de Klerk has taken a number of actions recently that
we can only characterize as very very endouraging,'' he added.
   Baker recalled bush had said release of Mandela from prison
could lead to a visit to Washington by him and DeKlerk.
   De Klerk's announcement that he would free Mandela and lift the
national state of emergency within a few weeks would fulfill two of
the five conditions set out in U.S. law for lifting the economic
sanctions against the apartheid government.
   ``It's quite possible that within the next few weeks that four
out of the five will have been fulfilled, which gives the president
the authority,'' to remove the economic sanctions, said Herman J.
Cohen, assistant secretary of State for African affairs.
   In a statement released from Camp David, Bush said, ``President
de Klerk has shown bold and imaginative leadership in recent days
which has earned the admiration of many of us who hope for swift
and peaceful evolution in South Africa.''
   Under the law passed by Congress in 1986, the president can
suspend or modify the sanctions if Mandela and other political
prisoners are released and Pretoria meets at least three of the
other conditions: lifting the state of emergency, legalizing
political participation for all parties, repealing laws that
regulate where non-whites can live and work, and beginning
good-faith negotiations with the black majority.
   If the administration determines four of the conditions have
been met, Cohen said, Bush will consult with Congress on easing the
sanctions.
   He said the Bush administration is ``actively looking at all of
these details'' involved in de Klerk's pronouncements, including a
review of political prisoners and whether any of them remain
jailed. De Klerk has previously freed several high-profile
political prisoners.
   He also recently lifted the ban on Mandela's African National
Congress and other opposition political organizations and said he
would negotiate with black leaders on a new constitution.
   The U.S. sanctions include a ban on importing South African
steel, textiles, uranium, coal and agricultural produce. They also
bar new U.S. investment in South Africa, forbid new bank loans and
end U.S. landing rights for South African Airways.
   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it was likely Bush would back a partial easing of sanctions,
not a complete removal, once the conditions are met.
   That would leave him some leverage with Pretoria to continue
pressing for an end to apartheid, that country's policy of racial
separation, the source said.
   Bush did not mention the sanctions question in his statement
Saturday, but he said a week ago that he was willing to review the
sanctions ``as new developments take place.''
   He said at that time, ``I think when people move in the right
direction, it is certainly time to review all policy.''
   Once Mandela is free, the lifting of the state of emergency will
be the action that ``really triggers'' administration willingness
to move on the sanctions, said Cohen.
   However, he added, ``The president is clearly not going to make
a decision without consulting Congress.''
   Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for helping plan the start of a sabotage campaign by the
African National Congress.
   In his dramatic announcement Saturday, de Klerk said the
3{-year-old state of emergency would be lifted in a few weeks if no
further unrest accompanies Mandela's release, and promised to
negotiate the possible release of remaining political prisoners.
   Under the remaining restrictions, police can still detain
suspects for up to six months without charge, ban protests, and ban
journalists or others from protests or areas of unrest.
   Bush was vice president in the Reagan administration which
fought the congressionally imposed sanctions.

   Voyager 1, which joined its twin
exploring the outer solar system, will snap pictures this week to
make an unprecedented family portrait of most of the planets and
the vast empty space between them.
   ``It will speak more to the mind than to the eye because of the
tremendous distances. What will be impressive will be the
distances,'' said Jurrie van der Woude, a spokesman at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   The complete portrait will be too large to be published, but
NASA may assemble the 64 eight-by-10-inch photos into a mosaic
stretching 100 to 150 feet along a wall at the laboratory.
   Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth and Venus will
appear as tiny dots against a background of dark space and the
constellation Eridanus.
   Mercury will be hidden by the sun's glare. Pluto is too distant
to appear in any images.
   While the solar system portrait won't have scientific value, its
purpose is ``really historical,'' said Bob MacMillin, a spokesman
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``This is not just the first time, but perhaps the only time for
decades that we'll be able to take a picture of the planets from
outside the solar system,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward
Stone.
   Voyager 1, which is about 3.7 billion miles from Earth, will use
its two cameras to photograph the planets and the sun between 5:15
p.m. and 9:20 p.m. PST Tuesday night.
   Because of other demands on NASA Deep Space Network tracking
antennas, the photos won't be sent back to Earth until late March,
and it will be late April until they are processed and can be
assembled into a mosaic, MacMillin said.
   The twin Voyager spacecraft were launched from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 2 explored
Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986 and Neptune last August. Voyager 1
explored Saturn in 1980, then flew above the plane in which the
planets orbit the sun, known as the ecliptic plane.
   Photographing the sun for the solar system portrait may warp the
shutter blades on Voyager 1's wide-angle camera, but there are no
plans to use the camera again anyway, NASA said.
   Voyager 1 will take the photos for the solar system portrait by
looking down from a position 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane.
Stone said no future missions are planned that would send a
spacecraft so high above the ecliptic plane.
   Voyager 1 was chosen to make the photograph because it is in
better position that Voyager 2.
   Both spacecraft are now studying electrically charged particles
and magnetic fields as they fly toward interstellar space. They are
expected to return at least limited measurements for another 25 to
30 years.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Warns Lack of Grain Could Reduce Meat Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top Soviet official in charge of food supplies
has warned that meat production, already woefully inadequate, could
fall further because of a lack of grain used to fatten livestock.
   In a speech to a meeting of Communist Party leaders this week,
Vladilen V. Nikitin, head of the state committee on food, said the
Soviet Union has been unable to grow the amount of grain mandated
by the economic plan.
   Nikitin also said in remarks published in Friday's edition of
the Communist Party daily Pravda that the government has been
unable to buy an additional 5 million tons of grain from foreign
sources needed to supply the country. That will mean less fodder
for animals, he said.
   ``There is no grain because there are no (production) means. ...
There are no other reasons,'' Pravda quoted Nikitin as saying.
   In some Soviet cities meat is rationed, with people receiving as
little as the equivalent of two or three good-sized hot dogs per
month.
   In remarks published Thursday, Nikitin said Soviet agricultural
production represents one-third of the national income but does not
receive adequate equipment.
   Government statistics for 1989 published last week showed that
after an investment of $110 billion in agriculture last year,
Soviet food production rose only 1 percent and not the 6.6 percent
expected.
   The Soviet government had hoped the program would help it obtain
additional grain more cheaply than by buying it in the West, but
authorities were still forced to import nearly 40 million tons last
year, 1 million more than in 1988.

   Hundreds of students staging an
anti-government protest clashed with police in the Niger capital,
and official reports Saturday said three people died.
   The military Cabinet of President Ali Saibou convened in
emergency session Saturday to discuss the student unrest.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse initially said five
to 10 students may have died in the confrontation Friday in Niamey.
On Saturday, the Niger News Agency and AFP said police shot and
killed three people and wounded 33.
   AFP quoted witnesses as saying about 100 armed police were sent
to block a bridge between the University of Niamey and the
capital's center to stop protesting university and secondary school
students from reaching offices of government ministries.
   Police first fired tear gas at demonstrators and then charged
the crowd several times. Some of them fired into the crowd, the
agency quoted witnesses as saying.
   The university has been closed since Thursday, when hundreds of
students started rallying to protest a government freeze on hiring
civil servants, including university graduates.
   Government officials have said the students expect too much from
this north-central African country that is among the poorest in the
world.
   Students also have been demanding an end to alleged corruption
in the government of Saibou, a brigadier general who was at a
drought conference in neighboring Bissau during the confrontation.
   Niger News Agency said Saibou returned home later Friday and was
meeting Saturday with his advisers and other politicians in an
effort to end the unrest.

<TEXT>
   Miles of Southern California
beaches were closed Saturday as cleanup crews tried to sop up a
black tide and officials revised the size of the American Trader
oil spill up to 394,000 gallons.
   The 12-mile-long slick stained beaches, threatened wildlife
habitats and taxed crews dabbing at the onslaught with absorbent
pads.
   Oil got through a boom across the Santa Ana River and caused
damage there, the Coast Guard said, but booms guarding other inlets
to ecologically sensitive wetlands areas were not breached.
   Twenty-six sea birds were reported to have been killed by the
spill and 60 birds were under care after cleaning.
   Authorities warned would-be volunteers to stay away because of
the toxicity of the contamination and the hazard from heavy
equipment being used in the shoreline cleanup effort.
   ``The public can be a hazard in this process if they don't let
the professionals come in and do their work,'' said Ray Picard,
fire chief and civil defense director of Huntington Beach.
   Closed to the public were 9 miles of sand from Seal Beach south
through Sunset Beach, Bolsa Chica State Beach and Huntingtion city
and state beaches. Farther south, Newport Beach also warned the
public off its beaches.
   Before lifeguards ordered spectators and volunteer cleaners to
leave the shoreline Saturday morning, David Manier, 16, of La Habra
and two buddies walked along Huntington Beach picking up blobs of
oil.
   ``We come down here almost every weekend to bodyboard and
stuff,'' said Manier. ``This is just really bad.''
   The main body of oil lurked offshore but winds and tides have
pushed fingers of the slick ashore at various points along the
entire 18-mile stretch since Thursday evening, 24 hours after the
tanker began leaking.
   The spill's estimated size was revised upward by nearly
one-third to 394,000 gallons, Coast Guard Capt. Jim Card told a
news conference.
   The slick had elongated to measure 12 miles by 3{ miles and was
centered 2{ miles off the coast between Huntington Beach and
Newport Beach. Some spots of oil were seen as far north as the Long
Beach Harbor entrance.
   A fleet of skimmer boats had recovered about 900 barrels of oil
by Friday night, Card said. Eight skimmers were at work and two
more were due Saturday.
   The Coast Guard, meanwhile, continued to pump oil from the
811-foot tanker which apparently punctured itself twice on its own
anchor about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday while mooring in shallow water at
an offshore oil pipeline.
   The accident remained under investigation. The Coast Guard said
drug and alcohol tests on the ship's officers, including Capt.
Robert Laware, were negative.
   Mike Murphy, vice president of American Trading and
Transportation Co., said divers inspected the hull and made a
videotape on Friday.
   ``There are very, very sharp indents. They almost look like the
fluke of an anchor might have done it,'' Murphy said. ``There's no
doubt in our mind that either our anchor or something like an
anchor did it. We're not exactly sure it was ours.
   ``However, I cannot explain the fact that I have a port anchor
on the vessel damaged to the point that I have to take it off the
ship and replace it.''
   The 90,000 barrels of oil that did not leak from the punctured
tank was transferred to a barge on Friday. Card said completion of
that process allowed for the more accurate assessment of how much
oil actually got out, resulting in the increase.
   The tanker will move from its anchorage off Huntington Beach
under its own power with 460,000 barrels of oil still aboard in
other holds, Murphy said.

<TEXT>
   The operators of Washington's Dulles
International Airport say a planned sequel to the action thriller
``Die Hard'' creates such a bad image of it that people may want to
take off and land elsewhere.
   The movie ``Die Hard II: Die Harder,'' will show airport
operations ``in a manner that will unquestionably undermine public
confidence in the airport and in air travel,'' attorney Edward S.
Faggen said in a letter last week to 20th Century Fox.
   The script calls for a deposed Latin American dictator-drug
runner to be flown to Washington for trial. But a band of
right-wing, overzealous former U.S. military officers, believing
that the dictator was an American ally, decide to take over the
airport and free him.
   One plane crashes and others are forced to circle above, running
low on fuel, until Detective John McClane, played again by Bruce
Willis, shootshis way to the rescue.
   Faggen, legal counsel to the Metropolitan Washington Airports
Authority, said the script ``reflects a reckless disregard for the
truth or the reality of the airport and airport operations.''
   The script depicts some Dulles management and employes ``in a
loathsome and contemptible manner,'' Faggen added.
   Fox officials said the film would include a disclaimer
identifying it as fiction, but Faggen said Fox should give the
airport a fictitious name and remove all references to Dulles.
   But the company ``has no plans to change the name,'' spokesman
Dennis Petroskey said. ``The Washington locale is very important to
the story line.''
   The film is actually filmed at Denver's Stapleton International.
Fox, however, is free to take exterior shots of Dulles for the
movie without permission, Faggen said.

<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda, one of the
staunchest critics of the South African government, said Saturday
he hoped the release of Nelson Mandela would lead to negotiations
between the government and South African black leaders.
   Kaunda said he looked forward to ``serious negotiations starting
as quickly as possible, because I don't think we have the time to
waste.''
   The Zambian leader said his first reaction to news of the
African National Congress leader's scheduled release Sunday was to
pray.
   ``I knelt down and prayed. The first thing I did was to say
thank God, he is great,'' said Kaunda, a lay preacher and former
schoolteacher.
   Zambia is the external headquarters of the ANC, which until Feb.
2 was outlawed in South Africa.
   In the group's first official reaction to de Klerk's
announcement, senior ANC official James Stuart called it ``very
exciting news.''
   ``We welcome Nelson Mandela back from all those years of
imprisonment into our midst with great joy,'' Stuart, a member of
the ANC national executive committee, told reporters.
   ``It is really a turning point in our history, something we and
the whole world have been demanding,'' he said.
   Stuart said the external ANC leaders expected Mandela to visit
them in Zambia ``at some point in the future'' to take up his place
as ``the formost leader of our organization.''
   De Klerk said that Mandela will be freed at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EST)
Sunday from the Cape Town prison farm where he has been serving a
life term for plotting to overthrow the white-led government.
   ``We can hardly believe it. It is a little bit unreal. Now is
the time for great celebrations for the ANC and for our people at
home and for all those who supported us over the many years,'' said
Stuart.
   Stuart, asked about possible ANC policy changes in the wake of
Mandela's release, said the group's leaders were scheduled to hold
a series of meetings in Lusaka.
   ``I cannot say how we are going to react in the sense of what we
are going to do immediately, but we are certainly very happy,'' he
said.
   Kaunda said the months ahead would probably be ``a very trying
period'' in South Africa.
   ``We cannot expect things to start moving quickly and smoothly
all at once. The greatest thing is that Nelson Mandela will be out
of prison tomorrow. This will enable the ANC leaders to begin to
get together the rest of the leadership in South Africa and begin
talking across color and any other artificial barriers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Perrier Halts Production, Recalls Mineral Water in Benzene Scare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAVOIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Reporter</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Perrier Group of America Inc. began
removing its bottled mineral water from U.S. stores on Saturday and
shut down its France-based bottling operation after finding benzene
in some samples.
   Benzene is considered a poison, but a Food and Drug
Administration spokesman said Saturday the levels detected in FDA
tests of Perrier water pose ``no immediate health risk.''
   ``If I had a bottle in the refrigerator, I would drink it,''
said acting FDA Commissioner James Benson.
   Benzene is a clear, flammable, poisonous liquid used as a
solvent for fats and in making lacquers, varnishes and dyes. At
high enough doses, it has been linked to cancer in animals.
   Ronald V. Davis, president of Greenwich-based Perrier Group of
America, which distributes the bottled water in the United States,
characterized the presence of benzene as a ``freak accident.''
   The company believes the chemical's presence was caused by a
human error in France, either in the production of the glass
bottles, the bottling of the water, or its transportation, Davis
said at a news conference Saturday.
   ``There is no reason at all it should be in our product,'' he
said. ``We don't understand it.''
   He said the company has ruled out sabotage and has found no
evidence of benzene in the natural, underground mineral spring in
Vergeze, France, where the water is drawn and bottled by a
127-year-old French company.
   ``We are not producing at all until we are sure we have found
this needle in a haystack,'' he said.
   The company plans to destroy its entire U.S. inventory, about 72
million bottles, and has directed distributors to start pulling the
water from stores' shelves, Davis said.
   The company hopes to resume production ``very, very soon,'' he
said, but plans on losing two or three months' worth of sales _
about $40 million _ because of the depletion of inventory and the
halt in bottling.
   Perrier has not detected benzene in European samples and has no
plans to recall the drink from European stores, Davis said.
   The bubbly water, sold in distinctive green bottles, has
acquired great popularity in the U.S. as a healthy, upscale soft
drink. The company estimates annual U.S. sales at $150 million.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency found levels of
benzene in Perrier samples at two to four times the Environmental
Protection Agency's standard for drinking water. The standard is 5
parts per billion, and the levels found ranged from 12 to 20 parts
per billion, he said.
   The elevated levels were discovered by North Carolina health
officials during routine testing.
   However, Nesbit said the FDA's health evaluation board
``concluded that there is no immediate health risk. ... People can
continue drinking Perrier.''
   ``These are fairly low levels and there's a negligible risk
involved here,'' he said.
   A lifetime of drinking water with these levels of benzene would
increase the risk of cancer by one in a million, which is generally
recognized as negligible, he said.
   Nonetheless, the company felt its actions were warranted to
restore consumer confidence, Davis said. ``We're in the integrity
business, selling purity and quality.''
   The company will offer refunds to customers and has established
a toll-free number for consumer complaints or inquiries, he said.
   In Paris, a spokeswoman for the French health ministry confirmed
that there is no contamination at the spring. Tests at Perrier's
source are done regularly by the local office of the Direction
Generale de la Sante.
   French Health Minister Claude Evin has asked Perrier to test
some of the bottles and cans of water in France to make sure there
is not a similar problem to the one in the United States. The
company is expected to begin testing the water next week.

<HEAD>Woman Who Initially Refused Amputation Thanks Doctors For Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman whose initial refusal to have a
gangrenous leg amputated led to a court battle thanked doctors
Saturday after they removed the infected limb, her grandson said.
   Doctors amputated Ruth Trabelsi's right leg just above the knee
Friday night. She developed gangrene in the foot as a complication
from hardening of the arteries and blood clotting.
   ``After the operation she said `I hope it's all over and they
won't have to take off anymore,''' said Peres Trabelsi, a grandson
of the 84-year-old woman.
   ``She thanked the doctors, but she's groggy now and has a little
trouble breathing so we told her not to speak,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Poriah Hospital in Tiberias.
   Trabelsi said doctors listed his grandmother in ``moderate''
condition.
   Mrs. Trabelsi initially refused to have the operation, saying
she wanted ``to enter the Garden of Eden on both feet.'' Doctors
said she would die without the surgery.
   The case went to court last week under a law that requires the
state to protect people who may not be capable of making decisions
for themselves.
   But the government dropped the case after a geriatric specialist
testified that Mrs. Trabelsi was lucid and fully capable of making
her own decisions.
   Some of the woman's 258 children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, however, continued to press the woman to have
the surgery.
   Only on Friday did Mrs. Trabelsi consent to the amputation after
a visit from Mordechai Eliahu, chief rabbi of Israel's Sephardic
Jews, those of Middle East and African origin.
   Eliahu, who flew from Jerusalem to Tiberias by helicopter, had
said that if she refused the amputation of the gangrene-infected
leg, she would be violating religious law by in effect committing
suicide.

guise for the old Communist Party.
   ``It's a dictate,'' Raul Volcinski, economic adviser to the
center-right Democratic Christian Union, said Saturday.
   The interim government _ the Council of National Unity _ is a
multiparty body formed Friday. It replaced the National Salvation
Front's ruling council that took power from hard-line Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in December's revolution and executed
him.
   The Front stepped aside after reversing an earlier pledge not to
field its own candidates in the May 20 election. But opposition
leaders say the new Council of National Unity is packed with Front
supporters and former leaders of the now-defunct Communist Party.
   ``The Front is the second edition of the Communist Party,''
Volcinski said.
   A leading Ceausescu critic who quit the Front's ruling council
was quoted in an interview published Saturday as saying the West
should stop all economic aid to Romania pending the creation of
democracy in the country.
   ``The revolution in favor of democracy and against communism is
in great danger,'' said Doina Cornea, quoted by the French-language
newspaper Tribune de Geneve in an interview at her home in the
western town of Cluj.
   Baker, who planned a four-hour stopover in Bucharest Sunday
morning en route to Canada, will be the highest-ranking U.S.
official to visit Romania since the revolution. Washington welcomed
the uprising but last month protested what it called the National
Salvation Front's intimidation of opposition parties.
   Baker was to meet interim President Ion Iliescu, Premier Petre
Roman, opposition leaders, students and the ethnic Hungarian priest
Laszlo Toekes, whose expulsion from the western city of Timisoara
sparked the revolution.
   The Council of National Unity held its inaugural meeting on
Friday and Iliescu praised it for reaching consensus, a view backed
by some political parties.
   But the major opposition parties said they will tell Baker that
there was anything but consensus, and they accused Iliescu of using
steamroller tactics to keep the Front's grip on power.
   The Council of Unity expanded the number of people on the body
from the 180 on the Front's council. Iliescu said it would have 253
members but Romanian reporters following the proceedings, which
were not open to the foreign news media, counted 259 members.
   Tariceanu said Iliescu ignored an agreement to limit the number
of parties in the council to 30 and packed the non-party bloc of
seats entirely with Front members.
   Other party representatives also charged that the party bloc
included bogus parties created by the Front for the purpose of
assuring its majority.
   ``It is very obvious to all the people that they tried to create
the impression that the political parties are fighting for power,
which is not true,'' said Calin Tariceanu, a member of the National
Liberal Party's top organizing committee.
   ``But it was the Front who were demonstrating that they did not
want to share power. They want to remain the leading force. That is
obvious,'' he said.
   The Front's decision to field candidates in the May election
sparked widespread protests by opposition parties and students who
were in the forefront of the revolution. They demanded that the
Front resign, arguing that it couldn't be both a referee and a
player in the election.
   The U.S. protest on Jan. 30 followed the largest demonstrations
in Bucharest since the revolution, in which pro-Front demonstrators
attacked the Liberal Party headquarters and attempted to get into
the National Peasant Party headquarters. Twenty-six offices of the
Peasant Party around the country were attacked.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler said the Front's
intimidation appeared to be directed at ``legitimate organizations
which are seeking a legitimate independent role in Romania's new
political order.''
   Democratic Christian Union Vice President Voinea Octavian
charged that the Front is using the ``still intact'' mechanism of
Ceausescu's hated Securitate secret police ``to intimidate and
terrorize the political parties.''

<TEXT>
   Three small children who attended a
day-care center owned by a man arrested on pornography charges have
been found to have gonorrhea, sending distraught parents to a
counseling center.
   The youngsters, ages 2 to 4, attended the Rainbow Learning
Center and were among 20 children identified from thousands of nude
photographs found at the home of the center's owner, John W.
Shaver, police said.
   Police announced Friday that throat cultures done on the three
children turned up the disease, which is usually transmitted
through sexual contact.
   ``We have to find out where the infection came from,'' Fort
Lauderdale police spokesman Ott Cefkin said. ``We have nothing that
links Shaver or the center with those three cases. Other people
have had contact with these children.''
   All 20 youngsters identified from among 3,200 photos of nude
children found at Shaver's home were tested for gonorrhea, as were
other youngsters who attended the preschool.
   Results for the other children were pending Saturday or had come
back negative, authorities said.
   Numerous worried parents not listed on the center's registry
began to contact police after Shaver's arrest Jan. 28 on five
felony counts of possessing child pornography in the form of
magazines and other published material.
   Shaver, 56, has not been charged in connection with the
photographs of children. The pictures do not depict sex acts or
sexual poses, but show the children at play, authorities said.
   Police already know of more than 200 families who used the
day-care center.
   ``We've been counseling the parents,'' said Joanne Richter,
director of the Broward County Sexual Assault Treatment Center.
``Their state of mind ranges from disbelief to denial to anger and
guilt that they sent their kids there.''
   After the announcement of the infections, several parents
contacted the treatment center to bring their children in for
medical and psychological examinations or counseling, Cefkin said.
   ``In such an alarming situation, the parents feel better if they
know what's going on,'' Ms. Richter said.
   Shaver ran a day-care center in Hawaii in the mid-1980s, but it
was closed in 1984 amid allegations that he fondled young girls at
the center. He was never charged and denied any wrongdoing.
   Shaver, who posted $5,000 bond on the Florida charges, denied
any improper actions with children. He tried to commit suicide Feb.
2 by slashing a wrist and was undergoing treatment at a mental
health center, authorities said.
   Although the photographs themselves are not pornographic under
the law, they could lead to sexual exploitation accusations against
Shaver if the evidence meets that criteria, police have said.

   Nelson Mandela's daughter said Saturday
she is pleased her father will walk out of prison in daylight
rather than under the secrecy of night.
   Now, she hopes trustworthy advisers will help him as he takes
his first steps from imprisoned martyrdom to the down-to-earth
reality of life as a black leader.
   ``He has to stop living now as this martyr, this god, and live
as a human being,'' said Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, a Fulbright
Scholar studying anthropology.
   Saturday morning, just an hour after South African President
F.W. de Klerk announced that Mandela would be freed unconditionally
Sunday afternoon, the phone ran incessantly at his daughter's
apartment near the University of Massachusetts.
   Mandela-Amuah, who is known as Maki and lives in this college
town with her husband and three children, was elated by the news
but her responsibilities as a mother took first priority. She said
she would spend the day with her children at a dinosaur exhibit she
had promised them.
   She said, however, she would be in church Sunday to ``thank God
it finally happened.''
   ``That will be my celebration,'' said Mandela-Amuah, whose
father was jailed more than 27 years ago when she was 8 years old.
   Mandela-Amuah, the youngest of three children from Mandela's
first marriage, said she didn't expect to visit her father before
summer because until then he would likely be caught up in political
matters.
   ``What I want is that quality time,'' said Mandela-Amuah, who
says she will be getting to know her 71-year-old father for the
first time. ``I am selfish in that way, but really I have to be
selfish.''
   It had been rumored that Mandela would be smuggled out at night
to avoid the protests of political extremists. But Mandela-Amuah
said it would have been hypocritical for her father to leave prison
under the protection of a regime he had battled for years.
   ``He can't accept their security. He has to walk out in the
open,'' she said. ``It's not that I don't have fear that my father
is in great danger. I am worried about that.''
   Mandela, imprisoned for his role in planning the African
National Congress guerilla campaign against white minority rule,
will likely receive protection from ANC after his release, his
daughter said.
   Meanwhile, at a news conference in Boston, activist Patrick
Lekota said Mandela's release was a victory in the battle against
apartheid in South Africa.
   ``Short of national liberation, Nelson's release marks total
victory,'' said Lekota, a spokesman for the United Democratic Front
in South Africa.
   ``From here we can scale the heights,'' said Lekota, who was in
town to participate in an international conference on non-violent
political action sponsored by The Einstein Institution.
   At a separate press conference later in Boston, Mandela's eldest
daughter, Zenani Mandela-Dlamini, said she was excited that her
father was being freed.
   ``This is what we've worked for all these years,'' she said,
adding that there were still many problems in her country.
   Mandela-Dlamini, 31, a student at Boston University, was
accompanied at the press conference by her husband, Thumbumuzi, and
her two daughters and son.
   ``I'm proud of who he is,'' she said. ``I know he has a job to
do outside.''

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu did a jig in
the street Saturday to celebrate Nelson Mandela's imminent release
and other neighbors in this black township outside Johannesburg
sang and danced near the jailed leader's home.
   In Kathlehong, another black township southeast of Johannesburg,
police said five blacks were killed and 45 injured after officers
used tear gas and birdshot to disperse a crowd of anti-apartheid
protesters. Police would not give further details Saturday night.
   he rally was held shortly after the white-dominated government
announced the 71-year-old leader of the African National Congress
will be freed Sunday after 27 years of imprisonment.
   ``Come, come, come, Mandela!'' women and children sang in Zulu
outside the small brick home that Mandela's family has rented for
40 years in the old Orlando section of Soweto.
   Tutu, who lives a few blocks away, came out of his home
laughing. ``It's a happy day,'' he said, and began to dance.
   Commenting that he had never before given the popular ``Viva''
black freedom salute, Tutu decided this was the time, and he
shouted ``Viva!''
   As he was driven away in a car, Tutu looked out the window and
yelled ``Yaaaayyyyyyyyy!'' waving to a few people gathered around.
   In Johnannesburg late Saturday night, more than 3,000 blacks
marched to celebrate Mandela's scheduled release. Some ran as
police cars followed, others gathered in groups shouting ``Viva,
Mandela,'' ``Welcome to our Leader.''
   Women hugged Sunday editions of newspapers bearing Mandela's
picture to their breasts, kissing the photograph and shrieking with
delight. Cars honked their horns and people waved from the
balconies of apartment buildings.
   A few whites gave ANC salutes and there were a few in the
procession; others looked terrified, shrinking against buildings as
the marchers passed.
   When some young blacks spat at white bystanders, other blacks
stopped them. Many white motorists honked their horns seriously and
some drove at high speed, sending black marchers scattering but
causing no injuries.
   Some whites in high-rise apartments hurled bottles as a column
of marchers, shadowed by police cars, reached the multiracial
neighborhood of Hillbrow. No one was hit. Young blacks pantomimed
firing at police with make-believe Soviet-designed AK-47 automatic
rifles, the symbol of the ANC's military wing.
   But Tutu said one of Mandela's main tasks would be to try to
bring South Africans together and obtain social justice for blacks.
   ``What Nelson is going to be doing is to focus all those
aspirations (of the people), and we'll be able to draw people of
different points of view together in bringing about this new,
non-racial, non-sexist democratic South Africa,'' Tutu said.
   President F.W. de Klerk told a news conference in Cape Town that
Mandela would be freed at the gates of Victor Verster prison on
Sunday afternoon.
   The rest of the world heard the news before most South Africans.
It was not broadcast on government-run radio and television until
an hour later, and a black-oriented TV channel did not interrupt
its coverage of a soccer game. But later the entire news conference
was shown, and the story took up all of the evening news programs.
   Most of Soweto's 2.5 million people got news of Mandela's
release by word of mouth.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, attended a funeral earlier Saturday for
Clayton Sizwe Sithole, boyfriend of her youngest daughter,
Zindziwe. Sithole was found hanging in a cell at police
headquarters two weeks ago after being arrested in the
investigation of a year-old murder.
   Mrs. Mandela, wearing a khaki uniform and military cap with
braiding and epaulettes in the gold, green and black colors of the
African National Congress, arrived at the modern house where she
has lived for several years in a separate section of Soweto called
Diepkloof.
   A crowd of 50 women and children were already in the street
around her home, but de Klerk's announcement was five minutes away.
A woman who answered the phone at the old Mandela home said the
Prisons Service had been calling Mrs. Mandela all day to alert her
to the news.
   When Mrs. Mandela finally heard, she came out of her house and
got into a white car, which was immediately surrounded and halted
by singing, dancing neighbors. She repeatedly reached out the
window of the passenger side to shake hands with well-wishers but
made no comment.
   There was more cheering and dancing when she stopped briefly at
the old Mandela home, where an ANC flag flies from the roof.
   Wilton Mkwayi, a member of Mandela's first guerrilla unit who
was freed from a life prison term along with other ANC leaders last
October, has been occupying the old Mandela home.
   ``We naturally feel very jovial. It is a moment that for 28
years we have waited for impatiently,'' said Popo Molefe, a leader
of the United Democratic Front, the nation's largest anti-apartheid
coalition, which de Klerk legalized on Feb. 2.
   ``His release has come as a result of the ordinary struggles
taking place on the ground,'' Molefe said as he entered the Mandela
home for a meeting of black leaders.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said
Saturday he intends to be at the gates of the prison when Nelson
Mandela walks out a free man.
   Jackson, on his first visit here in a decade, called President
F.W. de Klerk's announcement that Mandela will be released Sunday
``a hopeful step in the right direction.''
   But he added: ``He (Mandela) is out of jail, but not free; not
free to move to the neighborhood of his choice, not free to send
his grandchildren to the school of his choice, not free to vote,
not free to run for office in his own country.''
   Jackson also told a news conference that police had fired at a
crowd of 2,000 people who gathered in a township to greet him, and
one man was wounded.
   Police said a black man in possession of a South African
security force rifle had fired at ``an opposing group'' and at
police, and that police returned fire but the man escaped.
   Police made no mention of injuries, but said none of the
vehicles in Jackson's entourage was hit.
   Jackson said his aides were trying to contact a Cabinet minister
about the shooting.
   ``If the police, who reacted this way to 2,000 people, display
the same mentality when tens of thousands of people are on the
streets to welcome Mandela, what could be an occasion of great hope
could be a disaster,'' said Jackson, who has run two unsuccessful
campaigns for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
   Jackson praised de Klerk's ``bold and courageous acts'' but said
the president must be encouraged to dismantle apartheid.
   He said he was worried about the powers police continue to wield
under the national state of emergency, which de Klerk has said will
be ended in a few weeks if political unrest does not erupt with
Mandela's release.
   Police currently are authorized to take any action they see fit
to protect law and order, and they can order gatherings to disperse
within seconds.
   ``I would not like to think what would happen if any policeman
were to use his awesome powers under the state of emergency when
Mr. Mandela is on the streets or meeting people,'' Jackson said.
``It would cause the kind of disaster nobody, not even Mr. Mandela,
could turn around.''
   Jackson's comments and activities were heavily covered by the
media at the start of his visit on Thursday and Friday. There were
a couple dozen reporters at his news conference on Saturday, but
his trip by then had been overshadowed by news of Mandela's release.

   Hundreds of extreme right-wingers
yelling ``Hang Mandela!'' marched through the streets with swastika
flags Saturday to demand the overthrow of President F.W. de Klerk.
   Members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, dressed in khaki
uniforms and armed with whips, knives and pistols, marched to
government headquarters with a tiny white coffin representing
whites killed in terrorist attacks. Marchers dumped the coffin
after police refused to accept it.
   ``Hang de Klerk!'' and ``We are ready to fight!'' the column of
about 2,000 marchers yelled on their way to the Union Buildings.
``Hang Mandela!''
   The march began before de Klerk made the long-awaited
announcement that black leader Nelson Mandela would be freed from
prison Sunday. But the news spread quickly among the demonstrators
as the march progressed.
   Blacks throughout the country celebrated the news. Mandela,
leader of the African National Congress, has been in prison for
more than 27 years.
   Police said five blacks were killed and 45 injured after
officers fired birdshot and tear gas to break up an anti-apartheid
demonstration in the township of Kathlehong outside Johannesburg.
Authorities provided no further details.
   Hundreds of police, who authorized the white march in Pretoria,
stood guard along the way. Marchers scuffled with some journalists
and onlookers but there were no other incidents. Police ordered
blacks to leave the area to avoid confrontations.
   Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the white resistance movement,
told about 3,000 people at a rally before the march that de Klerk's
plan to negotiate with blacks on extending some political rights to
them was a betrayal of South Africa's white minority. He said the
government's move would trigger a massive white backlash.
   ``We will launch a revolution to save our freedom,'' he told the
cheering crowd. ``We won't give up a centimeter of South Africa.''
   TerreBlanche said de Klerk's legalization of the ANC and other
anti-apartheid groups Feb. 2 was an acceptance of terrorism. He
said the president was crippling the white security forces and
preparing the way for black domination.
   ``He's inviting the murderers of the ANC to the table for
talks,'' TerreBlanche said.
   His supporters, including hundreds of men, women and children in
the group's khaki uniforms, applauded and waved the group's
swastika-style red, white and black flags. Some protesters carried
Nazi swastika flags.
   ``No blacks'' and ``Hitler was right,'' said signs carried by
marchers.
   Local journalists said the crowd attracted by the resistance
movement was much larger than its other recent meetings in the
Pretoria area.
   TerreBlanche tried to present 30 coins, representing the
biblical 30 pieces of silver paid to Judas to betray Jesus Christ,
at the president's office at the Union Buildings. A senior police
officer refused to accept the money and TerreBlanche hurled it on
the ground.
   ``Judas, come and fetch your money!'' enraged marchers yelled.
   Hundreds of whites watched the march through the city, many
leaning out of apartment windows as the singing column passed, but
most people showed no sign of sympathy or support.
   Asked about de Klerk's announcement that Mandela will be freed
Sunday, TerreBlanche said he had no reaction. He declined to
comment on his plans, beyond saying his group would call for a
referendum to oust de Klerk.
   The group supports the continuation of white supremacist rule.
Its support in the past has been confined to a few thousand members.
   De Klerk announced Saturday that Mandela would be released
Sunday after 27 years in jail as part of plans to begin
negotiations with black leaders on extending political rights to
blacks.
   By law and custom, South Africa's apartheid system establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>White-Supremacist Network Includes Guards, Inmates at Ohio Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white-supremacist network of up to 800
inmates also includes guards and controls prostitution, drugs and
gambling at Ohio's maximum-security prison, a legislative committee
official alleges.
   Gov. Richard Celeste on Friday ordered an immediate and
comprehensive investigation of gang activity at the Southern Ohio
Correctional Facility at Lucasville after the panel linked the
group to the stabbings of four black inmates. Three of the inmates
died of their wounds.
   The allegations surfaced in a letter to state Sen. Paul Pfeifer
from the executive director of the Ohio Legislature's prison
oversight committee.
   Peter Davis of the House-Senate Correctional Institutional
Inspection Committee told Pfeifer the network at the prison
includes guards as well as inmates, who wear tattoos of lightning
bolts on their necks.
   They earn their lightning bolts by violently attacking other
inmates, authorities said.
   Davis said in the letter that the white supremacist group has
gained substantial power at the prison.
   ``Recently the gang was estimated to number between 600 and 800
inmates. The whites have reportedly gained control over drug
dealings, prostitution and gambling within the facility,'' Davis
said.
   The prison has 2,142 inmates, 940 of whom are white.
   In several other states, prison officials said they use a divide
and conquer approach to white supremacist groups in their prisons.
   In California, white supremacists have assaulted guards inside
and outside prisons, said Tip Kindel, a California Department of
Corrections official.
   Kindel said the problems peaked about five years ago. To keep
leaders from recruiting new members, prison officials placed many
of them in isolation, he said.
   In Washington state, corrections officials control
white-supremacist inmates by moving potentially violent ones
frequently within a prison and between prisons, said Veltry Johnson
of the Department of Corrections there.
   In Idaho, where many supremacist groups often hold retreats,
such inmates spend hours in prison libraries and often sue the
state prison system unsuccessfully, said Dick Vernon, the Idaho
corrections director.
   Nick Howell of the Illinois Department of Corrections said white
supremacists have not been noticed in his prisons, but those on the
outside often mail hate literature to inmates.

<HEAD>Infant Who Had Heart Surgery Before Birth Dies From Complications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 5-week-old baby who underwent heart surgery
before birth died from complications Saturday after his parents and
doctors decided to turn off his life-support systems, hospital
officials said.
   Doctors at Guy's Hospital had described the two operations on
the unborn child as the first successful prenatal heart surgery.
   But Dr. Michael Tynan, head of the surgery team, said baby
Michele Vermilio's heart condition had taken a toll on his kidneys
and they never improved enough to provide a proper blood supply to
enable him to live without a ventilator.
   If the ventilator supporting his lungs had been left running,
Tynan said, the baby would not have died but would have continued
to suffer.
   ``Despite sedation and despite painkillers, he was beginning to
be very distressed,'' Tynan said.
   Kidney dialysis treatment, which had been causing pain, was
stopped on Friday.
   Hospital staff had continued to treat him with painkillers,
medication and food in case he was able to sustain life on his own,
a medical report said.
   Michele died within 45 minutes after the ventilator was shut
off, said Tynan, professor of pediatric cardiology at the hospital.
   ``He died in his parents' arms. We were doing our best to ensure
he did not have any unnecessary suffering,'' Tynan told a news
conference.
   The exact cause of death was not given.
   He said the decision to turn off the ventilator, which assisted
the child's breathing, was made by medical staff and the parents,
Ann and Bernard Vermilio.
   Doctors said the baby suffered from a rare defect called
critical aortic stenosis, a blockage of the aortic valve in which
blood cannot be pumped at the right pressure. Heart failure can
result.
   Lindsay Allan, the doctor in charge of the fetal cardiology
unit, said most fetuses with the defect die in the womb and the few
who survive birth do not live more than a day.
   She said the two operations on the fetus involved inserting a
catheter, a slender tube, down a hollow needle directly into the
chest wall and heart.
   Once in place, the tiny plastic balloon _ measuring .11 of an
inch _ was inflated with a saline solution to open the heart valve,
Ms. Allan said.
   The mother received a local anesthetic and was awake during both
operations.
   ``There was no indication that the fetus felt anything,'' said
Darryl Maxwell, director of the hospital's fetal medicine unit, who
monitored the surgery with an ultrasonic scanner.

   Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip on
Saturday broke up a gathering of Palestinians mourning the death of
an Arab youth killed last week and wounded 21 of them, hospital and
Arab reports said.
   They said the troops entered the home of the parents of Ayman
Khalil Zakout in the Shabura neighborhood of Rafah and ordered
those there to leave.
   A shoving match broke out between the soldiers and mourners, and
troops opened fire when hundreds of neighbors started to intervene,
Arab reports said.
   They said Palestinians had gathered to offer condolences to
Zakout's parents. Zakout, 18, was fatally shot in a stone-throwing
clash with troops on Feb. 7.
   Doctors at Nasser Hospital in Rafah said that 47 people,
including a 70-year-old man shot in the left thigh, arrived at the
hospital after the melee.
   They said that 21 of them suffered from gunshot wounds and the
rest were wounded by rubber-coated metal pellets.
   An army spokesman said 31 wounded arrived at Nasser Hospital,
but that 21 were treated and released.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said the clash had occured near Zakout's house, but
that officials were still checking the circumstances.
   Palestinians have been waging a 27-month-long revolt against
Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   During that time, 655 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers and civilians. At least 181 Palestinians have been killed
by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of cooperatin with Israel.
Forty-three Israelis also have died in the violence.
   At least nine other Palestinians were wounded Saturday in
stone-throwing clashes with soldiers, Arab reports said.
   In Gaza City, soldiers used tear gas to disperse about 60
members of the outlawed Palestine Communist Party as they marched
through a main market to celebrate the eighth anniversary of its
founding, Arab reporters said.
   Communists also held a similar demonstration in the occupied
West Bank city of Nablus, where about 50 party members paraded
through the center of town waving PLO flags and red banners, Arab
reporters said.
   The army said one youth was wounded in an ensuing stone-throwing
clash with soldiers.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, the symbol of
South African blacks' struggle for equality, will become a free man
Sunday after 27 years in prison for fighting white-minority rule,
President F.W. de Klerk announced.
   De Klerk said Saturday he hoped the long-awaited release would
halt decades of racial conflict and clear the way for negotiations
that would extend political rights to the black majority.
   The release ``will bring us to the end of a long chapter,'' de
Klerk told a news conference. ``There can no longer be any doubt
about the government's sincerity in seeking to create a just
dispensation based on negotiations.''
   Six anti-apartheid activists conferred with Mandela about
logistics of the release and told reporters the 71-year-old black
leader, along with his family, would ride to freedom in a
bulletproof Mercedes-Benz through the gates of Victor Verster
prison farm outside Cape Town.
   De Klerk said he met with Mandela Friday night and was convinced
the prisoner, jailed for helping launch the African National
Congress' guerrilla campaign, was ``committed to a peaceful
solution.''
   The government released a photograph of the two leaders at their
meeting _ the first picture of Mandela made available to the public
since the 1960s. He is shown next to de Klerk, hands folded in
front, a big smile on his wrinkled face.
   Mandela's freedom has been a longstanding demand of black
leaders in South Africa, as well as governments and human rights
groups abroad, and the decision drew immediate international praise.
   In Johannesburg and its main black township, Soweto, blacks
thronged the streets in celebration.
   ``Our leader is coming!'' shouted an excited black youth in
Johannesburg amidst a din of freedom songs and car horns. Other
blacks jogged through major thoroughfares holding aloft newspapers
with the huge headline: ``He's Free!''
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu did a jig on the street in Soweto,
Mandela's hometown, and declared, ``These are incredible days in
which we are living.'' Outside the small brick home Mandela's
family has rented 40 years, women and children sang in Zulu,
``Come, come, come, Mandela!''
   But in Kathlehong, another township near Johannesburg, police
said five blacks were killed and 45 injured after officers used
tear gas and birdshot to disperse a crowd of anti-apartheid
protesters. The rally began shortly before the announcement of
Mandela's release. Police would give no further details.
   The South African Press Association, an independent domestic
news agency, quoted Mandela as saying in a recent interview that he
sought to promote unity between blacks and whites.
   ``Whites fear the reality of democracy,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``We must work towards a common destiny, and that can only
be achieved through a non-racial society and not one in which
whites continue to demand special political treatment.''
   The news agency did not specify when the interview was conducted
or how it was arranged. Mandela is not known to have received any
journalists as visitors.
   President Bush said Mandelas release would be a ``significant
step'' away from apartheid. British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher congratulated de Klerk for a ``wise decision'' and said
the time had come to resume contacts with South Africa's isolated
government.
   ``It's a great victory for our people,'' said James Stuart, a
member of the ANC's executive committee. ``I can hardly believe
it.''
   But in the capital, Pretoria, hundreds of extreme right-wingers
yelling ``Hang Mandela!'' marched through the streets with swastika
flags to demand the overthrow of de Klerk's government.
   De Klerk, who stunned South Africans on Feb. 2 by lifting a
30-year ban on the ANC, said Mandela would be freed unconditionally
at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EST) Sunday at the gates of Victor Verster prison.
   Bulelani Ngcuka, one of the activists who met Mandela late
Saturday, said police had expressed concern about his safety.
   ``We thanked them, but said the security of Comrade Mandela is
our own affair,'' Ngcuka said. ``We will do all in our power to
protect him.''
   They said Mandela would make a statement to the press and give
an address from the balcony of Cape Town's City Hall.
   At his news conference, De Klerk also said the 3{-year-old state
of emergency could be lifted soon if there was no upsurge of
unrest. He expressed willingness to negotiate the possible release
of remaining political prisoners.
   Mandela, in recent talks with the government, had demanded
freedom for all political prisoners and an end to the state of
emergency.
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for helping plan the start of the ANC's guerrilla
campaign. Many South African blacks consider him their paramount
leader, and he would be a favorite to win the presidency if blacks
were allowed to vote.
   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the 28 million blacks
have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, on a 12-day visit to South Africa, said
he welcomed de Klerk's ``bold and courageous'' acts but urged
nations to maintain pressure on the government until all
segregation laws are abolished.
   Mandela ``is out of jail, but not free,'' he said. ``Not free to
move to the neighborhood of his choice, not free to send his
grandchildren to the school of his choice, not free to vote, not
free to run for office in his own country.''
   There was no immediate comment from Mandela's wife, Winnie, who
left the family home in Soweto shortly before the announcement was
made. She smiled broadly as her car drove away.
   
   De Klerk, in his historic speech Feb. 2, lifted bans and
restrictions on dozens of opposition groups, scrapped some
state-of-emergency regulations, declared a moratorium on hangings,
and promised to free Mandela unconditionally.
   De Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, had offered to free Mandela
in exchange for a public renunciation of violence. Mandela refused,
saying the burden was on the government to legalize the ANC, scrap
segregation laws and agree to political negotiations.
   Asked if Mandela had now repudiated violence, de Klerk said the
black leader would be able to speak for himself Sunday.
   De Klerk, who succeeded Botha in August, has proposed
negotiations with black leaders on a new constitution that would
extend political rights to the disenfranchised black majority.
   ``The government is committed to bringing about through
negotiation a new constitution which is fair and just for all the
people of South Africa,'' de Klerk said. ``I hope that now that
this chapter has ended, the world and more especially the people of
South Africa will grasp the opportunity and play whatever
supportive role can be played toward a peaceful conclusion.''
   Asked whether Mandela's release, along with the earlier
concessions, would bring about an end to Western sanctions against
South Africa, de Klerk replied: ``We are not working against
checklists. We are doing what we believe is in the best interests
of South Africa.''
   The government has expressed fears about Mandela's safety in
light of reported death threats from right- and left-wing
extremists. De Klerk said the matter of security was being
discussed with Mandela's colleagues, but added: ``When he is
released he becomes a free man. He doesn't owe it to me to inform
me about his program.''
   Mandela, quartered at a comfortable house at Victor Verster for
more than a year, has been meeting regularly with a wide range of
government officials and anti-apartheid activists in recent months.
   The government has indicated it would accept his offer to serve
as mediator if talks with the ANC take place.
   Concessions announced by de Klerk in his speech met most of the
ANC's conditions for negotiations. The organization says de Klerk
still must lift the state of emergency and free all political
prisoners, including those convicted of violent acts.
   In his Feb. 2 speech, de Klerk lifted long-term bans on the
South African Communist Party and on the Pan Africanist Congress, a
guerrilla movement smaller than the ANC and less open to a role for
whites in the liberation struggle.
   A senior Pan Africanist leader, Barney Desai, on Saturday became
the first long-term political exile to return to South Africa in
the wake of de Klerk's announcement. Desai, 57, went into exile in
1962 while facing prosecution for defying restrictions placed on
him by police.

<HEAD>French Mediator Arrives in Beirut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a pro-Arab French lobbying
group who helped persuade guerrillas to release two French children
in 1988 arrived Saturday amid speculation he was on a new mediation
mission.
   Lucien Bitterlin drove to Moslem west Beirut from Damascus,
capital of neighboring Syria, to meet Defense Minister Albert
Mansour, Information Minister Edmond Rizk and army commander Gen.
Emile Lahoud at a beachside hotel.
   Bitterlin, a former Gaullist member of Parliament who leads the
Franco-Arab Solidarity Association, refused to talk to reporters
about why he was in Beirut.
   But his arrival raised speculation that he was seeking to secure
the release of French and Belgian captives held by a radical
Palestinian guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal.
   Bitterlin negotiated the Dec. 29, 1988, release of Marie-Laure
Valente, then age 7, and her sister, Virginie, then age 6, from 13
months of the captivity with Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary
Council faction.
   The Libyan-backed guerrillas still are holding the children's
mother, Jacqueline Valente, and a baby daughter born in captivity,
as well as five Belgians.
   They were taken captive Nov. 8, 1987, when the Silco, an old
sardine trawler, was seized off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip by
Abu Nidal's guerrillas.
   There have been reports that the boat was in fact seized off
Libya, adding to the mystery that has surrounded the plight of the
captives since they disappeared.
   The Abu Nidal group claims the adults are agents of Mossad,
Israel's intelligence service, and have made ``valuable''
confessions.
   The girls' freedom was widely viewed as an effort by Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi to boost his image at a time when the
U.S. government, alleging Libya was building a chemical weapons
plant, threatened to launch a military strike.
   Gadhafi called for the girls' release during Christmas 1988.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council has been blamed for scores of
terrorist acts, including the December 1985 attacks on Rome and
Vienna airports that killed more than 20 people, the September 1986
attack on an Istanbul synagogue that killed 21 worshipers and the
1983 mid-air bombing of a Gulf Air jetliner that killed all 122
people aboard.
   The case is considered unrelated to the 18 Westerners held
hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions. They include eight
Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped on March
16, 1985.

   A lawmaker angry over what he called
official corruption brandished a big knife during a session of the
People's Assembly on Saturday, then said he was quitting and
stormed out.
   The Middle East News Agency said no one was hurt. It identified
the deputy as Ahmed Shetya of President Hosni Mubarak's majority
National Democratic Party.
   Rhetorically addressing the absent Mubarak, Shetya demanded that
all forms of corruption be fought, then took out ``a big knife''
and started waving it about, the government-run agency said. He
ignored pleas by parliament speaker Rifaat el-Mahgoub to calm down
and put away the weapon.
   Then he shouted out his resignation and charged from the session
hall.
   Mahgoub ordered Shetya's speech struck from the session's record
on grounds the lawmaker violated People's Assembly rules requiring
members to address only their colleagues or the speaker.
   Middle East News Agency said it was the first time a member had
brandished a knife during a session of the 458-member assembly.
   Last year, then-Interior Minister Zaki Badr got into a fistfight
when an opposition member, walking out on the minister during a
particularly rambunctious speech, tried to deck him.
   A senior member of the National Democratic Party, Kamal
el-Shazly, told the news agency that the party is ``against
corruption anywhere'' and that Shetya gave no examples of what
raised his ire.
   He said National Democratic parliamentarians have a right to
their opinions, even if they disagree with party leaders, and that
Shetya would not be punished.
   Also, el-Shazly said, Shetya's announcement of his resignation
was invalid because he had not followed regulations for quitting.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Saturday
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised to respect
German reunification, and he declared it a ``very good day for
Germany.''
   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also disclosed
that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the four
victorious World War II Allies to be ready this year to present to
a pan-European summit meeting.
   At a news conference following 2{-hours of talks with Gorbachev,
Kohl gave a glowing assessment of relations with the Soviet Union
and the Kremlin's attitude toward the accelerating developments
between East and West Germany.
   Kohl said he acknowledged in his talk with Gorbachev that de
facto reunification is occurring faster than anyone expected and
said the two Germanies along with the Allies must work out a
program for controlling it.
   Gorbachev agreed that the decision on reunification ``is the
sole right of the German people,'' including the time frame and the
method, Kohl said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass carried a report on the
Gorbachev-Kohl meeting that supported Kohl's assessment.
   Kohl said the World War II Allies _ the United States, Britain,
France and the Soviet Union _ should be consulted in reunification
planning.
   ``This should happen between the two (German) governments, but
not behind the backs of the four powers,'' the chancellor said.
   ``At the end of this year there would be an opportunity within a
summit-level European conference to discuss and announce these
results,'' Kohl said. The Soviets had previously suggested such a
meeting.
   ``General Secretary Gorbachev told me unequivocally that the
Soviet Union will respect the decision of Germans to live in one
state,'' Kohl said. ``This is a very good day for Germany and a
happy day for me personally.''
   Kohl and Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
indicated that a clear promise to respect the current boundaries
outlining East Germany and West Germany also would be contained in
a reunification plan.
   Kohl was received in the Kremlin for an evening of negotiations
with Gorbachev, who is trying to cut Soviet losses from the
democratic revolution that has drawn East Germany away from the
Warsaw Pact.
   Gorbachev's acknowledgment nearly two weeks ago that German
unification was inevitable set off a chain reaction of events that
have stepped up the movement toward a single Germany.
   Tass commented in a report on the Kohl-Gorbachev meeting that a
new political situation has evolved in central Europe and ``the two
German states determine its nature in many respects.''
   The Soviets face potentially major losses in military and
economic cooperation if East Germany joins with the rich West
German nation, now part of the NATO alliance.
   Kohl, on a two-week diplomatic sweep to forge a unity plan
acceptable to both East and West, brought with him an offer of $132
million in aid for Soviet food purchases, apparently to demonstrate
that Germany will help restore the economic losses from redirected
East German trade.
   East Germany has suffered a severe economic decline in recent
months as an exodus to West Germany increasingly claims its best
workers and precludes independent efforts at recovery.
   As many as 3,000 East Germans flee the uncertainty in their
homeland each day, and some West German officials fear imminent
collapse.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told reporters
before the West German officials arrived that the Kremlin sought
assurances that a reunited Germany would recognize current borders
and never rise as a threat to its European neighbors.
   Both West Germany and East Germany are bound by treaties to
respect the current borders of Europe, but a united Germany is not
committed to those terms.
   Conservatives in West Germany have suggested that reunification
should be sought within the 1937 borders, which include areas in
the Soviet Union as well as nearly a third of present-day Poland.
   Shevardnadze called the border issue the ``most relevant issue''
to be resolved in the reunification process. Shevardnadze and
Genscher held their own talks before joining Gorbachev and Kohl.
   The Soviets also have pressed for a neutral Germany in the event
the two states are united _ a condition rejected by Bonn as well as
NATO.
   While Soviet approval and that of the other victor powers would
be needed to transfer control of Berlin to a united Germany, the
Kremlin has little clout in determining the political shape of the
reunited state.
   Last year's pro-democracy uprisings throughout Eastern Europe
have weakened the economic and defense bonds with the once-dominant
Soviet Union, and the potential loss of East Germany would deal the
Kremlin its most harmful blow.
   Two-thirds of the Soviets' 575,000 European-based troops are
deployed in East Germany, which is also the most important allied
trading partner for the economically troubled Soviets.
   Kohl returns to Bonn for meetings with East German Premier Hans
Modrow on Tuesday and Wednesday, when the West Germans' plans for
economic integration with East Germany will again be the primary
topic of discussion.
   Kohl will see French President Francois Mitterrand after his
talks with Modrow, then travel to Camp David to meet with President
Bush.
   East Germans on March 18 vote in their first-ever free
elections, and Kohl has said he will negotiate the details of
reunification only with the new, elected leadership.

<TEXT>
   Jordan has asked the Soviet Union to halt
Jewish emigration to Israel until the Palestinian issue is
resolved, Prime Minister Mudar Badran said Saturday.
   Badran, speaking to The Associated Press during a break in a
Parliament session, said Jordan ``made it clear that if this
immigration was to be to the Israeli-occupied territories, it means
that we started practical steps toward crushing all future peace
chances.''
   He did not say how the Jordanian request to the Soviet Union was
made.
   Israeli officials have said they expect 300,000 Soviet Jews to
immigrate to Israel over the next few years. Israel's prime
minister, Yitzhak Shamir, aroused anger in Arab countries two weeks
ago when he said Israel should hold onto the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to handle an influx of immigrants.
   Palestinians are fighting for their own state in the
territories, which Israel captured from Egypt and Jordan in the
1967 Middle East War.
   Badran praised a recent Soviet proposal to discuss such
emigration before the U.N. Security Council.
   ``We welcome such a move,'' he said.
   But he criticized Israeli efforts to open direct flights from
the Soviet Union to Israel _ a plan that has been stalled due to
the controversy over immigration to the occupied territories.
   ``This is a roadblock in the way of peace. The whole idea of the
Jewish exodus is a roadblock ... and it will not achieve any steps
toward a settlement,'' Badran said.
   The premier repeated a call for an Arab delegation to tour the
United States, the Soviet Union and East European countries ``to
explain the dangers of the Soviet Jewish exodus for the Middle East
peace process.''
   Information Minister Ibrahim Izzeddine said Jordan should urge
the United States to ``announce that Israeli settlements would not
be set up in the occupied territories and to cut all funds to
Israel if it (Israel) wanted to finance those settlements there.''
   Israel has appealed for foreign donations to help finance
immigrant settlement. But U.S. officials have said no American
government funds can be used for settlements in the territories.
   About half of Jordan's 3.1 million people come from Palestinian
families who fled their homes during Arab-Israeli wars.
   Jordanian officials say they fear Israel will again expel
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the occupied territories
to make way for the immigrants.
   In Oman, the emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
arrived in Muscat on Saturday for three days of consultations with
Oman's Sultan Qaboos.
   Official sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel was one of the top issues for
their talks.
   Qaboos is the chairman of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council, which also includes Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates.
   Jaber is the chairman of the 46-member Organization of Islamic
Conference, an umbrella organization for the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems.
   In a recent message, he castigated the Soviet Union and the
United States for allowing the Jewish immigration to Israel.

<HEAD>Police Briefly Arrest Six During Demonstration After Mass</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police on Saturday dispersed an
anti-government demonstration and briefly held five protesters and
a journalist following a Mass celebrating the recent release of
political prisoners.
   The military government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril on Wednesday
declared a general amnesty, released 19 political prisoners and
reiterated promises to hold elections scheduled for October.
   About 100 protesters chanting ``Down with Avril!'' began to
demonstrate at noon after attending the special Mass, celebrated at
the capital's Christ-Roi Church. They were dispersed about a
half-mile from the church.
   The six people who were arrested were released three hours
later, said independent Radio Haiti Inter.
   One of the arrested protesters was severely beaten before being
taken to police headquarters, it said. No other injuries were
reported.
   Willy Paul, a journalist for Radio Cacique, was arrested in a
house where he had taken refuge when police began breaking up the
protest, the station's director, Patrick Delansheer, told The
Associated Press.
   ``Willy was only covering the event, he was not a participant.
But the number of assaults on our station and personnel are
countless,'' Delansheer said.
   In early January, unidentified gunmen assassinated popular Radio
Cacique satirist Jean-Andre Destin, an outspoken critic of Avril.
   The Mass was attended by about 500 people, including many of
those released Wednesday. One of them, Evans Paul, who according to
witnesses was severely beaten while in jail, demanded his
``torturers'' be tried.
   ``After I lost consciousness, they brought me around by sticking
an ignited lighter up my nostril,'' Paul, leaning on a crutch, said
of his treatment by Presidential Guardsmen on the day of his arrest
in November.
   The amnesty came a week after Avril lifted a nine-day state of
siege declared after an army colonel was assassinated. During the
crackdown more than 50 activists were arrested, beaten, and later
released, activists and witnesses said.
   Seven prominent leaders were also forced into exile, but Avril
later said they could return. Most have refused, saying free
elections are impossible under Avril.

   An 18-year-old told his twin brother that
they would not be taken alive during a standoff in which they held
a sheriff hostage in a courthouse before they died in a
murder-suicide.
   In a tape recording made by one of the brothers during the last
few minutes of the standoff and played by authorities at a news
conference Saturday, Brad Jordan is heard making the comment to his
brother, Chad.
   ``They can come in and barge in or whatever they want. I'm going
to pull that trigger before anybody gets a chance,'' Brad Jordan
said.
   His words were followed by screams and the sound of two gunshots.
   At one point, the twins had demanded an oxygen tank and tried to
use it to create a diversion to help them escape, County Prosecutor
James Mayer said.
   ``The purpose for the oxygen tank (was) they wanted to fashion a
homemade bomb out of a tank that the emergency squad brought along
with them,'' he said. ``I guess it was their intention to throw
that out in the hall and distract the officers in the hall and try
to shoot their way out of jail.''
   In a separate interview Saturday, the twins' mother said they
had been in and out of trouble all their lives.
   Sandra Teeters spoke with her sons by telephone during their
seven-hour standoff Friday at the Richland County Courthouse, where
the two had been taken for questioning about a string of recent
burglaries.
   ``All they said to me was they wanted out. They said they either
wanted freedom or they were going out in body bags,'' she said in
an interview.
   Sheriff's Deputy Deb Strine was questioning the twins, Chad and
Brad Jordan, when they overpowered her, took her 9mm pistol, locked
themselves in a suite of offices and held her hostage.
   Sheriff Dale Shetler later exchanged himself for Ms. Strine.
   The standoff ended when Brad Jordan killed his brother, then
turned the weapon on himself. Shetler was uninjured.
   Mrs. Teeters said the twins, the youngest of her seven children,
had been problems since they were in kindergarten.
   ``It was just little things. They kicked their teachers. They
actually got put out of kindergarten,'' she said. ``It just kept
going that way. Mostly, though, they were just hyper and never
really hurt anyone. They always wanted attention.''
   The brothers were charged in a recent string of burglaries in
north-central and northeast Ohio. They were arrested in January
after a clerk at a convenience store triggered a silent alarm
during a robbery.
   Authorities said the burglaries began after the twins were
released last fall from juvenile custody.
   Mrs. Teeters said she had sought professional help for the twins
and had nothing to show for it but doctor bills.
   ``What all the doctors have told me. ... They just pass it off
as them being premature babies. You figure it out,'' she said.
   Mrs. Teeters said the county Children Services Board took
custody of the twins when they were 13 or 14, mostly because they
were runaways, and placed them in a succession of mental and
juvenile-detention centers.

   Senators of both parties on Saturday hailed
the plan to free black leader Nelson Mandela from a South African
prison and called on both sides in that strife-torn nation to begin
meaningful negotiations.
   ``It's the right move,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., said. ``Now comes the real test for South Africa _ will
there be peace as meaningful negotiations move forward? Let's hope
so.''
   The comment came in a statement released by Dole's office after
South African President F.W. de Klerk announced that the African
National Congress leader would be freed Sunday after 27 years.
   De Klerk also said the state of emergency under which freedoms
have been suspended in South Africa could be lifted within weeks if
conditions of stability prevail across the country following
Mandela's release.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chief Senate sponsor of
legislation to impose sanctions on South Africa, said in a
statement that ``freedom for Nelson Mandela means that freedom is
closer for all the people of South Africa.''
   ``His unjust imprisonment has long been the symbol of the
cruelty and injustice of the racist system of apartheid.'' Kennedy
said.
   He expressed hope that ``today's historic development marks the
beginning of a genuine commitment by President de Klerk and his
government to dismantle all aspects of apartheid as soon as
possible.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said in a telephone interview that the
release of Mandela along with de Klerk's other remarks were
``welcome and significant.''
   ``It is significant because without this there could be no real
negotiations and when you couple this with President de Klerk's
statement that within a few weeks he's going to completely lift the
state of emergency, you have the conditions for a successful
resolution of all this,'' he said.
   Sanctions against South Africa imposed by the United States and
European countries were credited in large part for the change in
course on the part of the South African government.
   The U.S. sanctions, imposed in 1986, barred new American
investment in South Africa, including bank loans to the government;
prohibited the import of South African iron, steel, coal, uranium
and agricultural products, including sugar; prevented the United
States from exporting computers to South Africa; banned all nuclear
trade; and halted landings by South African Airways.
   The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Ron
Dellums, D-Calif., said that the United States ``should continue to
use the moral and economic lever of even more stringent sanctions
as a vehicle for helping to accelerate and expedite the end of
apartheid in a nonviolent context.''
   ``While I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela from almost
three decades of imprisonment for his political beliefs, I am
concerned that no mention has been made about the release of more
than 2,000 other black South Africans still in prison because of
their struggle to end apartheid,'' Dellums said.
   Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., who recently traveled to South
Africa, issued a statement calling the release of Mandela ``a major
step forward for President de Klerk'' and ``one indication that the
winds of democracy that have swept across Europe may be reaching
South Africa.''
   ``However, before sanctions are relaxed or eliminated, several
additional steps must be taken,'' she said. ``These include release
of the many remaining political prisoners, lifting of the state of
emergency and removal of troops from the townships.''
   New York Mayor David N. Dinkins said Mandela ``could have been
released a long time ago if he had compromised his principles.''
   ``He is an inspiration to all those seeking freedom who will not
compromise and I look forward to his unconditional release and the
day all South Africans will be free,'' Dinkins said.
   ``Just because we freed one man doesn't mean we freed an entire
nation,'' said Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the House majority
whip and author of legislation imposing U.S. sanctions against
South Africa.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said Mandela's release marked ``a
significant step'' toward peaceful political change in the country.
   However, Lewis, a former activist in the U.S. civil rights
movement, also urged political leaders here to ``continue to apply
pressure on the South Africa government in the form of economic
sanctions.''
   Randall Robinson, leader of the Washington-based anti-apartheid
group TransAfrica, said pressure from the United States and Europe
produced the release of Mandela. He described it as a ``tiny step.''
   ``Political prisoners must still be released, parliament must
repeal apartheid laws and until these things are done it is too
early to evaluate the good faith of President de Klerk,'' he said.
   ``This is only the release of one great man,'' he said.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. and a leading conservative, was not
planning a comment on the development, an aide said. Dole was the
only Republican with a comment despite calls to spokesmen for
several prominent GOP members of Congress.

<HEAD>Report Accuses Iraq of Brutal Human Rights Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICK LUDINGTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>

   A human rights group said in a report
published Sunday that Iraq uses torture and execution to silence
the opposition, and it called on the United States to impose
sanctions to end the alleged practices.
   Middle East Watch, a branch of the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, said Iraqis face ``forced relocation and deportation,
arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, disappearance and summary
and political execution.''
   ``There is no meaningful legal recourse in Iraq against these
abuses,'' it said.
   ``Large numbers of persons have unquestionably died under
torture in Iraq over the past two decades,'' Middle East Watch
said. It did not give specific figures.
   President Saddam Hussein was quoted last month by visiting Arab
legislators as saying that Iraq soon will have a new constitution
that will provide for greater press freedom and allow the formation
of new political parties.
   Middle East Watch said its report is based on interviews with
Iraqis, government and intelligence officials, scholars,
journalists and other reports. It said its investigators were not
allowed to visit Iraq.
   The investigators said that an extraordinary cult of personality
around Saddam is part of the repressive system.
   Saddam is president of the all-powerful Revolutionary Command
Council and secretary-general of the ruling Baath Socialist Party,
as well as president and prime minister.
   ``According to emigre testimony, even spilling coffee on the
picture of Saddam Hussein that appears daily on the front page of
the newspapers has been known to lead to arrest and
interrogation,'' the report said.
   It repeated charges _ confirmed by the United Nations and the
United States _ that Iraq used chemical weapons against its
rebellious Kurdish population in 1988.
   Iraq also razed thousands of villages to relocate Kurds and
create a 19-mile-wide buffer zone along 750 miles of border with
Iran and Turkey, the report noted. At least 500,000 of Iraq's 3.5
million Kurds were forcibly dislocated, it said.
   The report accused presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan of putting
``the nurturing of newly friendly relations with Saddam Hussein's
government well ahead of the violent and repressive nature of his
regime.''
   Washington is reluctant to risk a break with Baghdad because of
``Iraq's enormous oil wealth ... and the prospect of lucrative
trade,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   An emerging chemical weapons accord and
significant progress on arms control marked a mostly successful
marathon negotiating mission here by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III that wound up Saturday with an unprecedented live debate
with Soviet legislators.
   The net result before Baker flew off to Sofia for talks with
government and opposition forces in Bulgaria, an East European
country in a rocky transition from hard line communism, is that
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev can
anticipate signing possibly two accords to curb chemical and
nuclear weapons when they meet at the summit in Washington in June.
   In an exceptionally glowing joint statement issued before
Baker's departure, the superpowers stressed that while ``certain
significant differences'' remain between them, the relationship
``is increasingly marked by understanding, cooperation and the
search for mutual advantage.''
   The evidence was striking during the four days of talks Baker
held with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and a long
session Friday with Gorbachev, who was still savoring his historic
victory within the Communist Party.
   At Gorbachev's behest, the Central Committee agreed to revoke
the party's monopoly on political power and set the stage for
political competition that might have Gorbachev running for
re-election as president.
   Surprisingly, Gorbachev told reporters ``let's wait and see''
when they asked whether he would make such a race as a communist.
   The most significant result of the negotiations was an
unexpected breakthrough on sea-launched cruise missiles, the most
difficult in a handful of knotty problems standing in the way of a
treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles,
bombers and submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Baker and the Soviets agreed to take the cruise missiles out of
the strategic weapons treaty that the two sides hope to sign at the
June summit meeting. Instead, the cruise missiles will be dealt
with in a separate side statement that evidently will not be
submitted along with the treaty to the Senate for ratification.
   For the first time, Baker openly acknowledged there is no sure
way to verify how many of the weapons carried by submarines and
surface fighting ships the other side has on board.
   He did not disclose what the statements would contain, but
separating the issue from the treaty is likely to improve the
prospects for a June signing ceremony at the White House.
   After years of hand-wringing and stop-start negotiating efforts,
meanwhile, Baker and the Soviets worked out a formula for
destroying U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons stocks.
   The emerging agreement, also slated for a summit signing,
provides for substantial reductions over eight years in stocks of
U.S. and Soviet poison gas, to be followed by the elimination of
all chemical weapons _ provided that dozens of other nations
negotiating in Geneva agree to abolish their stockpiles as well.
   The outcome was a diplomatic triumph for the Bush administration.
   When the president advanced his proposal last year, the Soviets
questioned the U.S. determination to retain 2 percent of the deadly
weapons until all nations capable of producing them signed the
international accord.
   The joint statement indicated the Soviets had accepted Bush's
formula.
   There also was marked progress toward a third arms control
agreement. Gorbachev countered Bush's State of the Union proposal
for a ceiling of 195,000 U.S. and Soviet Troops in Central Europe
with a suggestion that the ceiling be extended to superpower forces
on foreign soil throughout Europe.
   This would mean withdrawing the 30,000 American soldiers that
Bush's initiative would leave in Britain, Greece, Italy, Spain and
Turkey.
   Alternatively, Gorbachev said, he would go along with Bush's
overall European ceiling of 225,000 troops. This would give the
Soviets leeway to have 225,000 soldiers in Central Europe, where
most of the Red Army is based.
   Baker called Gorbachev's approach ``very close to the
president's proposal,'' but delayed a response until he meets with
the foreign ministers of the 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organization
allies in Ottawa, Canada, on Monday and Tuesday.
   Even on a technical level, the U.S. Arms control agenda moved
ahead.
   Agreement was reached for a full disclosure of data from
strategic missile tests and to set a ceiling on U.S. and Soviet
land-based mobile missiles that will be kept in storage under the
emerging strategic weapons limitation treaty.
   Also, the two sides decided on limiting the cruise missiles
carried by their bombers, but could not agree on how to restrict
the range of the missiles carried on the bombers.
   On the other hand, Baker clashed with the Soviets over the
ongoing delivery of late-model MiG-29 fighter bombers to Cuba. He
acknowledged he could not persuade Gorbachev and Shevardnadze to
keep the weapons out of President Fidel Castro's hands.
   Baker concluded his visit with a 90-minute appearance before the
International Affairs Committee of the Supreme Soviet. He is the
first U.S. official to appear before the legislative body, an event
he attributed to Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   
   Baker then flew to Sofia for separate meetings with government
and opposition leaders. He has criticized the country for the slow
pace of its reform, but Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov told
reporters ``We are prepared to accept, without any hesitation, the
wishes of the people.''
   Lukanov appealed an expansion of U.S. trade, which now consists
primarily of Bulgaria shipping wine and tobacco to the United
States in exchange for grain .
   Lukanov said the government was ``open for a dialogue with all
political forces, I mean it.''
   Baker met first with the government leaders and urged them to
conduct a ``free and fair'' election, a senior U.S. official said.
   He also stressed the importance of not forcing the assimilation
of ethnic Turks, who past regimes were charged compelling to adopt
Bulgarian names and to abandon their cultural and Moslem religious
practices.
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said Baker stressed that ``the credibility of the government
depends'' on how the elections are carried out.
   Then, meeting with 17 members of the Union of Democratic Forces,
an opposition coalition, Baker heard stories of political
imprisonment in prior years and difficulty in preparing for the
election because of newsprint shortages and problems in getting
organizing throughout the country.
   ``You can win if you stay united.'' Baker said. He told
reporters later the administration was ``reserving judgment'' in
the contest.
   On Sunday, Baker flies to Bucharest for a slightly longer than
four-hour visit to the Romanian capital.
   In his appearance before the Soviet legislators, Baker spoke
from a podium with a marble bust of Lenin peering over his shoulder
and borrowed the title of the Arthur Koestler novel in recalling
the ``Darkness at Noon'' that preceded Gorbachev's rise to power in
1985.
   ``Today, we see reason return,'' Baker said. ``Today, I come
before the founding fathers of a new Soviet Union ... a new Soviet
Union you are building.''
   But he then lectured the Soviets against spending badly needed
resources supporting Marxist governments in Cuba, Nicaragua, Angola
and Cambodia.
   Baker contrasted that activity with Gorbachev's policy of
non-interference in Europe, where the Soviet leader's actions
``have played a vital role in supporting the creation of legitimate
governments.''
   On the other hand, Baker said, ``We remain especially disturbed
by the military shipments your government continues to send to
those seeking military solutions to conflicts in regions vital to
us.''
   He added: ``This is even less comprehensible when it happens at
a time when your people clearly need those scarce resources put to
good use at home.''
   Several of the legislators responded in a question-and-answer
session with attacks on the Bush administration's refusal to engage
in naval disarmament talks and to halt nuclear weapons tests. They
also criticized the invasion of Panama.
   Gen. Sergei Akhromeyev, Gorbachev's military adviser, questioned
the modest reductions in U.S. military spending in contrast to what
he said was a 14 percent slash in Soviet spending, and he said the
United States had not dismantled dozens of military bases that have
surrounded the Soviet Union for 45 years.
   Baker defended the Panama invasion as a unique U.S. use of force
to remove Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whom Baker called a ``thug.''

   Severe thunderstorms slashed through parts of the Southeast with
tornadoes and high winds overnight and early Saturday, killing four
people, injuring dozens, knocking out power to thousands and
damaging buildings and automobiles.
   In the Atlanta area, two people died Saturday morning when trees
fell into their bedrooms, and a woman in north-central Louisiana
was killed Friday night when a wind gust flung her mobile home 30
feet, authorities said.
   ``We had a band of severe storms that developed over northeast
Texas and spread eastward during the afternoon,'' said Ernest
Ethridge of the National Weather Service. ``We've had rainfall
across the area of 4 to 14 inches.''
   Meanwhile, dense fog may have contributed to two serious
automobile accidents, including a head-on collision near Palo Alto,
Calif., leaving left four people injured, three severely, the
California Highway Patrol said.
   The thunderstorm line, moving east overnight, brought reports of
tornado touchdowns in Louisiana, Georgia, Florida and the
Carolinas, and high winds at one point knocked out power to 112,000
utility customers in Alabama and 300,000 in Georgia.
   Ethridge said winds up to 50 mph knocked down trees, and pea- to
golfball-size hail knocked out windows in buildings and cars in
northern Louisiana.
   In Calhoun, La., Shirley Robinson, 47, died and her 5-year-old
grandson Darrell Robinson suffered minor injuries Friday night when
the gust flipped her trailer home almost 30 feet, Ouachita Parish
sheriff's deputies said.
   The storm knocked out power to about 10,000 Louisiana Power &amp;
Light Co. customers, and the blackout continued into Saturday
morning for about 2,100 in Sterlington, said LP&amp;L district manager
Bill Turnbough.
   Georgia authorities said Elizabeth Stevens, 72, of Norcross died
when a 3-foot-thick pine tree fell into her bedroom, and Mantrell
Crowley, a 10-year-old boy was killed by a tree that fell on his
bedroom in southwest Atlanta.
   In Henry County, south of Atlanta, Thomas A. Henderson, 69, was
killed shortly after 6 a.m. when he was crushed by a tree as he
stood near his mailbox, according to county Coroner Ronnie Stewart.
   By midafternoon, repair crews had restored power to 200,000
customers in metropolitan Atlanta, but isolated areas could be
blacked out until Sunday, said Georgia Power Co. spokesman Trip
Cagle.
   Alabama Power Co. estimated 112,000 homes and business without
electricity in the southern two-thirds of the state, and called in
repair crews from Mississippi and Florida, said company spokesman
Mike Casey.
   The worst outages were in Montgomery, where 27,500 were out, and
in the Birmingham area, where 25,000 were in the dark. The company
reported 16,000 customers without power in the Anniston, Talladega
and Sylacauga area, plus 3,250 in the Phenix City area.
   At least 24 people were injured, two of them seriously, in
Alabama's Talladega County, and Sheriff Jerry Studdard said at
least 15 mobile homes were demolished. National Guard troops
cleared fallen trees that closed U.S. 280.
   The storms brought gusts of more than 80 mph in Atlanta and
Macon, with tornadoes damaging structures in Columbus, Americus and
other parts of northeastern Georgia.
   Columbus police Maj. Ross McCain said tornadoes touched down in
the central and east portions of that city, inflicting substantial
damage to buildings, but no injuries were reported.
   In Americus, authorities said a tornado touched down about 6:30
a.m., ripping the roof off a convenience store and flinging it 150
yards to land atop a house, where a man sleeping inside was injured
slightly.
   ``I was getting up to go to work when the rain started and I
looked out the window and saw the tornado,'' said Thomas Griffin, a
resident. ``Then I saw the store when it started falling apart.''
   In Douglas County, west of Atlanta, a wind storm slammed into a
trailer park north of Interstate 20, overturning at least two
mobile homes and triggering three fires, said Assistant Fire Chief
Stewart Haas.
   Guy West, chief deputy sheriff in Upson County in west central
Georgia, said emergency workers rescued a woman and child who were
trapped in their mobile home after it was overturned by high wind
about 6 a.m.
   In Gwinnett County, two large stores sustained serious damage
but police were reporting no injuries.
   The storm line advanced into the Carolinas, bringing tornadoes
and slashing winds early Saturday to western North Carolina and
northwestern South Carolina, where two people received minor
injuries.
   At least one tornado touched down in western North Carolina's
Cleveland County, said sheriff's deputy Mike Branch.
   ``Several mobile homes were destroyed, also some houses with
carports blown off and lots of trees were blown down onto the
houses. There's also a lot of barns and outhouses that were
destroyed,'' Branch said.
   A twister also touched down Saturday in the Florida Panhandle
city of Milton, damaging 50 to 60 homes, but causing no injuries,
officials said.
   Mississippi authorities said winds gusting up to 60 mph late
Friday and early Saturday blew out windows and ripped off roofs in
central and southeast parts of the state, but there were no
injuries reported.
   Rainshowers which pelted the Northeast earlier Saturday moved
out to sea by nightfall, while snow in northern Maine diminished to
flurries.
   Heavy rain in the northern Pacific Coast region also began to to
dissipate, as winds gusted in parts of the Northwest. A high wind
warning was in effect for some of the higher elevations of
southeastern Wyoming Saturday night, and through Sunday for along
the front range of the Rockies in Montana.

   Virginia Democratic leaders said Saturday
they have no candidate to oppose U.S. Sen. John W. Warner after
they spurned a supporter of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche who
offered to run as a Democrat.
   Paul Goldman, chairman of the state Democratic Party and a close
adviser to Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, said no Democrat has expressed
an interest in running against Warner and the party will not hold a
state convention this year unless someone steps forward by March 15.
   Warner, 62, is in his second term and is the highest ranking
Republican on the powerful Armed Services Committee.
   ``No one says he's doing a fine job,'' Goldman said after about
100 Democratic leaders gathered at the Marriott Hotel for a
Democratic State Central Committee meeting. ``I'd love to have a
candidate to run against him.''
   The meeting was interrupted briefly by several supporters of
LaRouche, a former fringe presidential candidate sentenced to 15
years in prison for conspiracy and mail fraud.
   Nancy Spannaus, a LaRouche supporter who wants to run against
Warner as a Democrat, was prevented from speaking at the meeting.
   ``I have a Democratic program,'' Ms. Spannaus said as party
regulars shouted ``no'' and ``get her out of here.''
   Alan Ogden, a LaRouche activist, accused the Democrats of
tacitly supporting Warner and President Bush by refusing to run a
candidate.
   ``This is not the Communist Party,'' Ogden shouted.
   Ogden was escorted from the meeting by hotel employees.
   State Central Committee members adopted rules that would make it
virtually impossible for Ms. Spannaus to win the Democratic
nomination. Under the rules, any candidate who wants to run must
win the support of 20 percent of the delegates picked at local
caucus meetings for a convention to be held.
   Caucuses are to be held in the spring. Goldman said a convention
would be held June 9 if a credible candidate steps forward.
   ``We're not going to foreclose anything at this juncture,'' he
said.
   Goldman said ``a strong current of pragmatism'' among party
members has made them reluctant to run a token candidate against
Warner.
   ``If someone just wants to run for the exercise, they ought to
enter their local marathon,'' he said. ``That's the sentiment I'm
finding.''
   It would be the first time this century that state Democrats
have not run a Senate candidate. Last year, the party swept the top
three state offices in an election that made Wilder the nation's
first elected black governor.
   The Democrats' strongest candidate would have been former Gov.
Gerald L. Baliles, but he said last year he did not want to run.
   Warner announced his re-election bid Monday. He said Saturday he
plans to campaign regardless of Democratic plans.
   ``If the Democratic Party elects not to endorse a candidate, I
will accept that decision with humility,'' Warner said.

   About 600 blacks marched to the mayor's house
Saturday and demonstrators continued sit-ins at Selma High School
and City Hall to protest alleged police brutality and a black
school superintendent's dismissal.
   Protesters had planned to walk from a Selma church to the Edmund
Pettus Bridge, a landmark in the civil rights movement of 25 years
ago, but organizers postponed that walk until Sunday.
   The protests have kept all of Selma schools closed since
Wednesday. Sit-ins have been held at the high school and City Hall
since Thursday.
   City attorneys Friday asked U.S. District Judge Charles Butler
of Mobile to issue a temporary restraining order against the
sit-ins. Butler scheduled a telephone conference with attorneys for
Monday, when schools were scheduled to reopen.
   The protesters' lawyer, J.L. Chestnut, said the judge ``told me
he recognized constitutional rights to exercise free speech and was
reluctant for the federal courts to step in but that he was also
duty-bound to deal with any excesses.''
   Protesters said they would not give up.
   Marchers were led to Mayor Joe Smitherman's home by the Rev.
Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. The marchers prayed for the white mayor, whose tenure
stretches back to 1965.
   Smitherman did not appear for marchers, who walked on to the
home of a black county commissioner and a shopping center.
   Police made no arrests during the march or Saturday's round of
sit-ins.
   ``We are wrapped in a sacred flag of history today,'' Lowery
said at the start of the march.
   The racial turmoil began when six white members of the school
board voted last week against extending the contract of Norward
Roussell, the city's first black superintendent. That ignited
protests leading to the closing of two schools Tuesday and all 11
of Selma's public schools Wednesday.
   Roussell was reinstated after the initial protests. But students
and other protesters want the school board to extend his contract,
which expires this year.
   Four blacks protesting the dismissal of Roussell were arrested
Monday during a melee at Smitherman's office.
   Rose Sanders, a Selma attorney, said she was the victim of
police brutality during the melee. A preliminary city report said
allegations of police brutality at the protest were unfounded.
   Lowery told marchers Saturday: ``The issue here, while we have
to deal with police brutality ... is unequal education. We must
bring down the walls of unequal education in the `90s as we brought
down the walls of disenfranchisement in the `60s.''

<HEAD>Landowner Convicted of Killing Farm Workers' Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wealthy landowner was
convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison Saturday for killing
a farm workers' leader he blamed for disputes over his property in
a southern state.
   The Chiapas state court said in a statement that Roberto Zenteno
Rojas was guilty of the December 1988 shooting of Sebastian Perez
Nunez, a former state legislator who led the Independent Center of
Agricultural Workers and Campesinos.
   Zenteno blamed Perez Nunez for disputes over his land. Peasants
had been occupying 120 acres of Zenteno's 740-acre ranch since
August 1988, demanding it be turned over to them.
   Under Mexico's agrarian reform law, which has given land to
millions of landless peasants, the government may take over land
holdings that are larger than legal limits or left idle and turn
them into ejidos, a type of communal farm.
   Personal disputes and vendettas over land rights are common in
Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state bordering Guatemala, where
hundreds of peasants have been killed in recent years over such
disputes.
   Witnesses said Zenteno shot Perez Nunez 13 times on Dec. 29,
1988, as he waited in a pickup truck to buy gas. The driver, Julio
Cesar Morales, also was wounded, but his wife and Perez Nunez's
wife, Manuela, were unhurt.
   Zenteno fled after the shooting but surrendered to authorities
on Aug. 30, 1989.
   Marcelino Nunez, Perez Nunez's successor in the worker's
organization, said after the conviction that his organization
trusted the criminal justice system, but that he was skill
skeptical about the government's commitment to carrying out land
reform.
   ``Roberto Zenteno had a lot of money, not only him, but all of
the big landowners who came to his defense,'' Nunez said.
   Perez Nunez' widow and the family of Zenteno could not be
reached immediately for comment on the conviction.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. James Courter, a longtime abortion
opponent who lost the New Jersey governor's race last year, has
changed his mind and supports a woman's right to abortion, a
spokesman said Saturday.
   ``As excruciating as it is for an individual that's trying to
make up her mind, that's how excrutiating it was for him,'' said
Bob Friant, a legislative aide. ``It's not easy to stand up and
say, `Hey, I'm changing my mind.'''
   Courter, who was soundly defeated by Gov. Jim Florio in the
November election, began the campaign assuring voters he would
``continue my pro-life'' efforts and oppose abortion except in the
case of rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life.
   Later, as it became apparent New Jerseyites widely favored a
pro-choice position, he softened his stance and said he would do
nothing to restrict women's right to abortions.
   The day after his loss to Florio, Courter said he would
reconsider his position on abortion. ``He is now stating he will
vote pro-choice on all relevant legislation,'' Friant said.
   Although Courter remains personally opposed to abortion, Friant
said, he has concluded government should not make personal, moral
or religious decisions for people.
   ``When he was running for governor he was exposed to a lot of
individuals ... who asked him to reconsider his position and made
some very persuasive arguments,'' Friant said. ``He began to
realize that perhaps this is not a decision that government should
impose on women.''
   ``We're glad to be able to count him in the pro-choice side,''
said Fran Avallone, state coordinator of Right to Choose. ``I think
the election in New Jersey made it clear to a lot of people that
the pro-choice position is the majority position.''
   Emma Byrne, Florio's spokeswoman, said the governor had no
comment on the report.
   Richard Traynor, president of the New Jersey Right to Life
Committee, said Courter's new position was consistent with his
``back-peddling'' during the campaign. The committee initially
backed Courter but withdrew its support.
   Courter, who represents the 12th Congressional District, is
running for re-election but doubts abortion will be a major issue
in the campaign.

   Robbers shot seven people in a bowling
alley office Saturday, killing a man, his two young daughters, and
another girl before setting a fire to try to cover up the crime,
police said.
   ``What we have here is a very vicious crime, the assassination
of kids,'' said Las Cruces police Capt. Fred Rubio. ``A whole
family was assassinated.''
   The three survivors and residents living near the Las Cruces
Bowl lanes gave police a description of two men believed to have
committed the robbery and shootings.
   Rubio said officers were looking for two Hispanic men, one
described as about 5-foot-11 with short, kinky hair and in his 30s;
the other as 5-foot-6, dark, heavyset and in his late 40s or early
50s.
   Officers were manning 10 roadblocks into and out of this city of
about 55,000 people, located 45 miles north of the Mexico border. A
helicopter was being used and 80 percent of the police department's
criminal investigation staff was working on the case, Rubio said.
   Rubio identified the dead as Steve Turan, a bowling alley worker
believed to be in his 30s, and daughters Paula Turan, 7, and
Victoria Turan, 2, and another girl, Amy Houser, 13.
   He said Victoria was alive when the victims were found, but was
pronounced dead on arrival at Memorial General Hospital.
   The three survivors were taken to the hospital where they were
in critical condition, Rubio said. He refused to release their
names, citing security reasons and concern for their safety. He
said one was 12, one was 30 and the third was in his or her 30s.
   The police captain said a fire was reported at the bowling alley
at 8:33 a.m., a half-hour after it opened.
   Firefighters found the seven victims in the office.
   ``According to our preliminary investigation, they were rounded
up and taken into that particular office,'' Rubio said. ``They were
concentrated in one area and shot in one area.''
   The robbers then started a fire in the office. ``It appears it
was to cover up the crime scene,'' he said.
   Rubio said the apparent motive was robbery, ``and apparently
they decided to rid themselves of any witnesses.''
   ``You're talking about a 3-year-old. What could a 3-year-old
testify to? This is why I say it's the worst,'' he said.
   Police did not disclose the amount of money taken, but Rubio
said:
   ``What makes it even worse, is not only the amount of people who
were shot for the amount of money taken ... if you start adding up
all these ages you're going to come up with 100 years of life that
was just gone by some ignorant people that did this.''
   Authorities said junior league games for youngsters had been
scheduled to start at the bowling alley at 9 a.m.

<TEXT>
   Burmese troops crossed into Thailand
while launching intense attacks on a rebel camp inside Burma and
nine soldiers were killed, Thai border patrol police said Saturday.
   The Burmese have failed to capture the Karen rebels' base, Kaw
Moo Ra, after four days of stepped up fighting that has included
intense mortar and rocket barrages, said police officers who
requested anonymity.
   The Karen are among a dozen ethnic minorities fighting Burma's
military government for greater autonomy. In recent months, Burmese
troops have overrun a string of Karen bases along the frontier.
   About 200 Burmese troops crossed the Moei River, which marks the
frontier, and entered Wang Kaew village Friday to attack Kaw Moo Ra
from the Thai side of the border, according to the police in nearby
Mae Sot, 250 miles northwest of the capital, Bangkok, and 140 miles
east of the Burmese capital, Rangoon.
   The Burmese withdrew from the village Saturday after warnings
from the Thai military in the area. They left the bodies of nine of
their soldiers. Thai police said they took into custody one wounded
Burmese military officer.
   About 500 ethnic Karen civilians have fled into Thailand from
the besieged rebel base.
   Fighting between Burmese troops and another rebel group of the
Mon ethnic minority was reported continuing around Three Pagoda
Pass, which Burma's troops overran late last week.
   Several thousand civilians from that border town also have fled
into Thai territory.
   The government of Gen. Saw Maung put down a nationwide
pro-democracy uprising nearly two years ago, killing hundreds of
people. The resistance forces now include students who sought
refuge in rebel camps following the crackdown.
   The Karens, one of the largest of the diverse ethnic groups
fighting the Burmese government, have resisted the integration of
their Karen state into the Union of Burma since Rangoon gained
independence from Britain in 1948.

   A sightseeing helicopter carrying four tourists
and a pilot went down Saturday afternoon in the East River,
bursting into flames after it crashed into the water near a
helipad, police and witnesses said.
   Police divers and a rescuer in a yellow life raft went out to
save the passengers and pilot, with some of the survivors holding
onto a board extended by the boater until help arrived, witnesses
said.
   Eighteen people were taken to the hospital, including a
14-year-old boy on the helicopter who was in critical condition
after his heart stopped, said Lt. Joseph Apuzzo of Emergency
Medical Services.
   Thirteen of the injured were rescuers who suffered exposure. The
other crash survivors also suffered exposure, said hospital
spokesman John Clark.
   All but the boy were expected to be released, he said.
   Police said the helicopter was taking off at the time of the
accident about 3:15 p.m. Witnesses said the Bell Jet Ranger 206-L
helicopter burst into flames after impact near the Manhattan
helipad, though police said flames were visible before the
helicopter touched water.
   After the people were pulled from the river, the copter turned
upside down and sank and the flames quickly went out.
   ``When it hit the water, it blew up,'' said Adam Deutsch, 12,
one of several children attending a bar mitzvah at the Water Club
restaurant who saw the crash from about 60 feet away. ``Three or
four people were trying to hang onto the helicopter.''
   The restaurant is on the shore of the East River about two
blocks south of the crash scene.
   ``We saw it take off. It started skidding on the water like it
was ice skating,'' said 12-year-old Brooke Herman. ``The helicopter
just crashed into the water.''
   Six firefighters and two police officers were treated at the
scene for exposure, Apuzzo said.
   Rescue efforts were aided by relatively calm water, although the
National Weather Service said water temperatures were likely in the
low 40s. Helicopters and an assortment of boats were brought in to
pull people from the water.
   The helicopter was owned by Island Helicopter Corp., Deputy
Police Chief Ron Johnson said. A woman who answered the telephone
at Island Helicopter's office confirmed that the copter was one of
Island's and said it had been taking off for a sightseeing trip
around Manhattan when it crashed.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the
crash, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration. She said the FAA was speaking for the NTSB under a
local agreement.
   Police said the critically injured boy was from Long Island and
his father, who also was on the helicopter, lived in New Jersey.
   The other two passengers on the helicopter were visitors from
France and the pilot lives on Long Island resident, police said.
   It was the third time in the last five years that an Island
helicopter coming into the East Side helipad had gone into the
river. A May 2, 1988, crash of another sightseeing helicopter
killed a Japanese businessman; three years earlier, a West German
man died when a copter with eight people aboard went down.
   The accident occurred just two blocks from a helipad on the East
River where sightseeing copters and a shuttle to Kennedy
International Airport are based.

<TEXT>
   The chief executive of the American Medical
Association resigned a year before he planned to retire amid
revelations about money-losing deals involving AMA investments and
two top staff members.
   ``I am convinced that the AMA should focus on the future now and
not wait until I go as planned,'' Dr. James H. Sammons said in a
news release the AMA issued Saturday.
   Sammons, 62, who is credited with guiding the association
through hard financial times over 15 years, had his fiscal
discretion curtailed two months ago by AMA trustees, who praised
him on his departure.
   The board of trustees said at its interim annual meeting in
Honolulu that Sammons had failed to follow routine fiscal policies
in approving deals between himself and two staff members.
   In one deal, approved by Sammons in 1987, the AMA used
pension-fund investments to reimburse one of the staffers $353,000
for his losses in the stock market crash.
   The officer resigned and has since paid back the money. Sammons
turned in his resignation Friday, the AMA statement said.
   In another deal, approved by Sammons in 1989, the AMA lost
$65,000 in a foreclosure settlement on a $267,710 loan it had given
one of Sammons' assistants to buy a condominium.
   The deals were brought to light last fall by the Sun Times of
Chicago, which published more details last week.
   The newspaper reported that the AMA lost $45,000 in the 1984
purchase of Sammons' suburban home and sale of the home a year
later.
   The newspaper also described a similar deal in 1980 in which the
AMA bought a home owned by Sammons' top deputy and later sold it at
a loss of $23,000.
   The Washington State Medical Association subsequently called for
Sammons to step aside during an investigation of AMA finances,
which the board initiated in October.
   The Illinois State Medical Society made an official call for
such a probe, and two other AMA affiliates asked that Sammons'
powers be limited.
   AMA trustee Dr. Joseph Painter said Sammons increased the AMA's
assets from $25 million to $193 million, helped increase membership
by 100,000 to more than 270,000 and expansion the association's
activities in such areas as medical publishing, education, science
and disease prevention.
   The board Saturday named Dr. James S. Todd acting executive vice
president to replace Sammons. Todd, a former chairman of the AMA
board, has been the organization's senior deputy vice president for
five years.

<HEAD>Man Suffering From Amnesia Identified as Former Serviceman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who didn't remember his past when
found wandering in a parking lot by police four month ago was
identified Saturday by people who said they were kin.
   They found him through a television news report.
   The man was identified by the people as Melvin Wolf, a
53-year-old former serviceman who had been living with his sister
in Texas until August.
   ``There's no doubt that he's Melvin Wolf,'' said the sister,
Donna Caskey of Angleton, Texas, after the meeting. ``The doctor
said his memory will probably come back gradually.''
   In October, the man was found with no identification and became
known as John Doe. A therapist put him through hypnosis, which
helped him remember pieces of his past, including a U.S. Army
serial number. The number belongs to Melvin Wolf.
   Mrs. Caskey, her husband, Charlie, and their son, James, met the
man and his therapist, Rick Selig, at the Topeka Psychiatric Clinic.
   She and other relatives had talked to him by telephone on Friday
without spurring any recollections of his past, and Saturday's
meeting again left him unable to remember.
   They called him Melvin, and said, ``Don't you remember me?''
   They showed him various pictures and other family mementoes, and
although Wolf said a few things seemed familiar, he was still
unable to recall who he was.
   ``It's a little confusing to him,'' said James Caskey, 30. ``He
said there's no doubt there's some connection with all the pictures
and the things we've been telling him. But he doesn't know us.''
   Saturday's reunion came after other relatives in Wisconsin had
seen a story about him.
   Selig had developed information that there might be a Wisconsin
connection, and reporter Russ Ptacek of Topeka's WIBW-TV called TV
in that state on Thursday to encourage them to use a story he had
done about the case.
   Ptacek said that minutes after his story was aired on WITI-TV in
Milwaukee Thursday night, two people living in Wisconsin
independently called the station and said they were relatives.
   Ptacek then called Selig and police to tell them of the
developments. Topeka police said Saturday they were still
investigating the case. They were still waiting on a fingerprint
check.
   In recent sessions, Selig had Doe draw things under hypnosis,
including a detailed sketch of what appeared to be a map.
   It had no meaning to anyone until Saturday, when Mrs. Caskey
looked at it and said it was the layout of the farm in Wisconsin
where she said they grew up.
   Mrs. Caskey said that Wolf had lived with her and her family in
Angleton, where she said he owned an electronics repair store. She
said he left home last Aug. 20 on a business trip to Washington,
D.C., and never returned.
   Selig, a clinical social worker, said the man was diagnosed as
suffering from psychogenic amnesia _ a total memory loss that he
said can result from some ``extraordinarily stressful event.''

   James F. Gordon, a former federal judge
who drafted a busing plan to desegregate Louisville schools 15
years ago, died Friday at age 71 of complications following lung
surgery.
   A resident of Venice, Fla., for the last three years, Gordon
died at Sarasota Memorial Hospital.
   Gordon became a senior judge with a reduced caseload in July
1976 and retired in January 1984, after 18 years on the bench.
   In 1973, as a U.S. district judge, Gordon dismissed a lawsuit
against Jefferson County public schools by a coalition of
civil-rights groups. But after an appeals court reversed his ruling
and ordered that busing begin in September 1975, Gordon drafted a
plan he later called the best in the country.
   He eventually said he had concluded that busing had helped
blacks and whites know one another better.

   Former President Reagan will give a videotaped
deposition for John Poindexter's trial in his first in-depth
questioning on the Iran-Contra affair since his two interviews with
the Tower Commission.
   In those interviews conducted three years ago by the
Reagan-appointed commission, Reagan said he couldn't remember when
he had approved arms sales to Iran.
   Reagan on Friday consented to a videotaped deposition in which
Poindexter's lawyers will ask him 154 questions, plus follow-up
questions.
   The subject areas will include Reagan's knowledge of Oliver
North's activities on behalf of the Contras and whether Reagan
authorized written responses to Congress relating to the Nicaraguan
rebels. Poindexter now faces felony charges in connection with
those responses to Congress.

   Sixteen days before the presidential
election, the leftist government honored a pledge and freed nearly
1,000 Contra guerrillas and the last 39 jailed members of former
President Anastasio Somoza's National Guard.
   President Daniel Ortega, who is running for re-election,
proposed the pardon earlier this month. The pardon _ and the
release Friday _ deprived his major opponent, Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, of a campaign issue for the Feb. 25 election.
   The release was witnessed by diplomats, four Contra commanders
who have laid down their arms, international election observers and
church and Red Cross representatives.
   The Sandinista government made the most of the ceremony, taking
several busloads of reporters to the Juan Navarro Central
Penitentiary, where the inmates stood in lines in front of the

   The resignation of a key official in President
Bush's beleaguered savings-and-loan bureaucracy is worsening fears
the government may be botching the selling of failed thrifts and
their repossessed real estate.
   Daniel P. Kearney, chief staff officer of the Resolution Trust
Corp. Oversight Board, quit Friday after complaining the board
wasn't giving him the authority he needed to do his job.
   The resignation is ``more evidence of the growing disarray in
the Bush administration,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Banking Committee. He predicted delay in
dealing with failed S&amp;Ls would increase the taxpayer cost of the
bailout.
   Economist Paul Getman of Regional Financial Associates, a
consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said bureaucratic infighting
is also heightening concern that a surplus of government-owned real
estate will depress property prices in some areas.

   The acquittal of reputed mob boss John Gotti on
charges he ordered the shooting of a union official brought cheers
in court and a celebration in the Queens neighborhood where the
``Dapper Don'' is king.
   Gotti, whom authorities say has been America's No. 1 organized
crime boss since December 1985, won his third victory over
government prosecutors Friday when a jury found him innocent of
assault and conspiracy.
   His co-defendant, Anthony Guerrieri, was also acquitted.
   Gotti's supporters applauded loudly as the verdict was read,
provoking Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin to threaten them with 30
days in jail if they didn't stop.
   After leaving court, he arrived at a favorite hangout in
Manhattan's Little Italy and was cheered wildly by people waiting
for him on the street. Near another Gotti hangout, the Bergin Hunt
and Fish Club in the borough of Queens, residents decorated homes
and stores with balloons and signs congratulating Gotti on his
acquittal.

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft snapped
photographs of Venus today after zooming around the planet in a
``celestial billiard shot'' that sent the robot explorer toward its
1995 encounter with Jupiter.
   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach Jupiter,'' said
Bill O'Neil, Galileo science and mission design manager at NASA's
Jet Propulsion laboratory. ``All systems have been operating
perfectly.''
   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at
9:59 p.m. PST Friday, passing 10,028 miles above the furnace-like
surface of the second planet from the sun, O'Neil said.
   Galileo's camera snapped pictures of the planet to study wind
and cloud patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the
presence of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.
