<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher is not the only grocer's
daughter to disturb the old order. Lady Shirley Porter is trying to
dust the cobwebs off Westminster, which includes Buckingham Palace
and Westminster Abbey.
   As leader of Westminster City Council since 1983, Lady Porter
has struggled to make one of Britain's richest municipalities run
as efficiently as her father's supermarket chain.
   The sprawling metropolis of London has no citywide government or
mayor. Each of the 32 boroughs elects its own council, which in
turn picks a leader. Westminster's 60 councilors are up for
election in May.
   Lady Porter, wholeheartedly embracing Prime Minister Thatcher's
free- market revolution, has sold the borough's garbage collection
and recreation facilities to private contractors.
   Since she became head of the council, more than 9,000
council-owned apartments have been sold to their occupants as part
of a national effort to turn tenants of public housing into
property owners.
   She is an international expert on litter and often is seen
walking around her bailiwick, picking it up. Lady Porter entered
politics in 1974 specifically to tackle trash, and lists her
recreations in Who's Who as ``cleaning up London'' and
``waste-hunting.''
   Her animated brand of radical conservatism invites frequent
comparisons with Mrs. Thatcher, who grew up above her father's
grocery store.
   Sir Jack Cohen, Lady Porter's father, parlayed an East London
vegetable stall into the Tesco supermarket chain and imbued his
younger daughter with his motto: ``You can't do business sitting on
your armchair.''
   Lady Porter became head of Westminster Council as a free-market
Conservative determined to eradicate the socialist structures that
had long dominated local government in Britain.
   Her strong-willed, sometimes autocratic style has inspired
allegations of financial mismanagement, most notably after
Westminster sold three old cemeteries for the equivalent of 8 cents
each. Critics claimed it was a case of desecrating the dead to cut
costs.
   In addition to councils, some boroughs have ceremonial Lord
Mayors. Westminster's handles the extensive ritual associated with
a 400-year-old district in the heart of a pageantry-loving country.
   An American-style mayor is more to Lady Porter's taste, and she
would like to be one. She said it's the best way to ``cut through
the bickering and the red tape and serve the interests of the
people.''
   She sees her goal as saving Westminster from becoming home to
only the very rich and very poor. Lady Porter says she wants to
give Westminster back to the middle classes, ``to encourage them to
stay so that we don't finish up like New York.''
   A recent survey by the magazine Harpers and Queen said Lady
Porter was the 20th richest woman in Europe, with an estimated
personal fortune of 50 million pounds ($84.5 million). Her title
derives from the knighthood of her husband, Sir Leslie Porter.
   Lady Porter's family background was reflected in her comment
recently to a meeting of foreign journalists: ``We believe in
services to the customer. We are a service-oriented council. It's
in my blood that people should be treated as customers.''
   Her 170,000 customers are Westminster's permanent residents.
They include the members of the royal family, who live at and
around Buckingham Palace, and the prime minister, currently Mrs.
Thatcher, who lives down the road at 10 Downing Street.
   Every day, the population is swollen to more than 1 million by
tourists, shoppers and workers who throng the Oxford Street
shopping district, West End theaters, Hyde Park, Victoria Station,
the Houses of Parliament, the government offices of Whitehall, and
the local church, Westminster Abbey.
   They leave enough litter to fill Trafalgar Square to the height
of Admiral Nelson's column five times a year.
   Westminster claims no council has done more than Lady Porter's
to fight rubbish. Prince Philip, who once accompanied her on
garbage inspection detail, has taken to greeting her at social
functions by calling across the room: ``How are the litter bins?''
   Businesses pay for the upkeep of 500 garbage cans, and 31
uniformed wardens can fine litterers of 10 pounds ($17) on the
spot. A telephone hotline is planned for residents to report
litterers, noise and curb-fouling dogs.
   Permanent residents get discounts on tourist attractions.
Residents can deal with officials by telephone or fax and
``one-stop services'' mean the availability at one counter of
everything from election registration to parking permits.
   Westminster is among the first British boroughs to introduce
glass recycling bins.
   The National and Local Government Officers' Association said 70
ranking officials had quit the Westminster government since Lady
Porter took over. One was Chief Executive Rodney Brooke, who left
last year with a retirement package said to be worth 1 million
pounds ($1.7 million).
   Brooke's retirement deal enhanced a controversy already swirling
around the sale in 1987 of the three rundown and unused cemeteries.
   The council said it wanted to save 450,000 pounds ($760,000) in
annual maintenance. The cemeteries, on prime development land, have
been resold several times.
   Scotland Yard's fraud squad found no criminal wrongdoing after a
year of investigation, but the district auditor's report concluded
the council had no authority to dispose of the cemeteries.
Westminster Council is suing the lawyers who advised it on the sale.
   Opposition Labor Party councilors also have attacked the council
for building Britain's most expensive parking lot _ 100 spaces in
Soho that cost 4 million pounds ($6.76 million) _ and for giving
grants to private landlords to repair luxury apartments.

   Woodsy Owl and his ``Give a Hoot, Don't
Pollute'' refrain are the latest victims in the battle between
loggers and environmentalists to save the spotted owl.
   Smokey Bear will continue to visit schools near the Siuslaw
National Forest as an anti-fire crusader. But his pal Woodsy, won't
be coming along.
   ``Right now is not the time to have Woodsy in the limelight,''
said Norm Hesseldahl, public affairs officer for the forest. ``The
emotions are running pretty high on the spotted owl issue right
now.''
   Hesseldahl said Wednesday the decision to keep Woodsy out of the
schools was made in conjunction with the state Department of
Forestry, which co-sponsors the visits.
   Woodsy is only being banned in schools in western Oregon's
Siuslaw forest area, Hesseldahl said. His poster still will be used
at campgrounds and other places, urging people not to pollute.
   ``We certainly don't want to get Woodsy and the spotted owl
confused in the kids' minds,'' Hesseldahl said.
   The northern spotted owl has been the focus of the battle over
logging in the old growth forests. A recent scientific report
recommends that huge tracts of old growth lands, including at the
Siuslaw National Forest, be preserved to prevent the owl from
extinction. The old growth forests are the main source of timber on
federal land in western Oregon.

   In the venerated Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
the center of Easter week activities, exactly 43 lamps burn over
the tomb where tradition holds the crucified Christ was buried.
   Thirteen each are tended by Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic and
Armenian clerics, and four belong to the Egyptian Copts.
   The jealously guarded division of duties reflects a complicated
system of caretaking that applies to church altars, candlesticks,
icon sites and other church property.
   The system was set up in the 1850s by ruling Ottoman Turks to
resolve centuries of unseemly squabbles among Christian sects for
control of the shrine.
   The tolerance of the four main Christian sects caring for the
church is tested anew each Easter season when thousands of pilgrims
from all denominations flood the church to commemorate the passion,
death and resurrection of Christ.
   Daniel Rossing, an Israeli expert on Christianity who formerly
served as a government mediator in church disputes, says that
problems during the holy days generally are unintentional.
   ``Processions get going the wrong way or zealous tourists block
aisles,'' he said.
   Fistfights broke out in the past when exhuberant youth groups
danced out of their assigned spaces and onto the turf reserved for
others, he added.
   ``Pity the police who have to sort it all out,'' Rossing said.
``Not only in Arabic and English, but in Russian, Greek,
Armenian....''
   The church will be more congested than usual this year because
the Eastern rite and Latin churches are celebrating Easter
simultaneously for the first time since 1987 and for the last time
this century.
   Their feasts generally are a week to five weeks apart because of
differences in the Julian calendar of the Eastern churches and the
Gregorian calendar used in the West.
   The potential for problems is greatest on Good Friday, when the
procession route of pilgrims retracing Christ's walk to Calvary
crosses the paths of Moslems headed to Friday prayers and Jews
going to Sabbath evening prayers at the Western Wall, the last
remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple.
   Moslems and Jews may be out in greater numbers than usual, too,
because Easter week also overlaps Ramadan, the Moslem holy month of
fasting, and Passover, the eight-day Jewish holiday commemorating
the Israelites flight from Egypt.
   Israel's Tourism Ministry says 45,000 visitors are expected in
Jerusalem for the holidays, the highest number since the start of
the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule more than two years
ago.
   ``We will have plenty of police at sensitive spots,'' police
spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   The fire department is prepared, too, for the dazzling and
potentially inflamatory ``Miracle of the Holy Fire'' by Orthodox
Christians on Saturday.
   As the flame from torches in the sepulcher is passed to
thousands of candle-carrying worshipers inside the church, more
than two dozen Jerusalem firefighters will wield special
extinguishers to douse the inevitable hair and clothing fires.
   The Church of the Holy Sepulcher _ a dark and dusky double-domed
basilica that covers the sites where tradition holds Christ was
crucified and buried _ is sacred to many Christians.
   The first church on the site was built in the 4th century by the
Byzantine Emperor Constantine whose mother, Queen Helena, traveled
to Jerusalem in 327 A.D. to identify the scenes of Christ's passion.
   Orthodox domination of the church gave way to Roman primacy
after the Byzantine basilica was destroyed by a fanatical Egyptian
caliph and it was rebuilt in the 12th century by the European
Crusaders.
   In succeeding years, under Arab and then Ottoman Turkish rulers,
the Orthodox and Latin rites resorted to bribes, secret agreements
and international diplomacy in their battle for supremacy.
   The jealousy is such that it took the rival church leaders until
1959 to agree on a still-incomplete restoration program to repair
damage from a massive 1808 fire and devastating 1927 earthquake.
   The Greek Orthodox are working alone to fix the dome over
Christ's tomb so their control of the area won't be challenged.
   The Rev. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, a Dominican priest and New
Testament scholar, says the Ottoman status quo agreement may have
resolved most property disputes but has not resolved spiritual ones.
   ``One hopes for peace, but the ear is assailed by a cacophony of
warring chants,'' he wrote in his guidebook, The Holyland. ``One
desires holiness, only to encounter a jealous possessiveness.''

   Saladino de Souza Gonzalez says he
has the perfect solution for Brazilians wanting to protect their
homes from burglars: guard lions.
   ``With a lion for a guard, the thief may enter but he won't
leave,'' said Gonzalez, a 45-year-old book wholesaler from Belo
Horizonte, Brazil's third-largest city.
   Gonzalez has raised lions for the past 10 years on his farm in
the interior. He said Brazil's soaring crime rate has helped create
a steady demand.
   ``I recommend a large backyard, the construction of a gate, and
plenty of space. Then let them roam free at night,'' Gonzalez said
in a telephone interview. Three lions guard Gonzalez's home.
   Gonzalez started with three lions smuggled from Africa and
raises a litter every three months. When the cubs are 30 days old,
he puts them up for sale for $300, using classified ads. So far, he
has sold 30 lions.
   ``They adapt remarkably well to life at home. I never have a
problem selling them,'' he said.
   Gonzalez said a baby lion needs to be fed two to three big
chickens a day, supplemented with a few cans of dog food. Adults
require four chickens and about nine pounds of meat daily, which
can run to about $250 a month.
   Keeping lions at home is legal in Brazil, said Capt. Allan
Salazar of the Forestry Police in Minas Gerais, of which Belo
Horizonte is the capital. He said non-native animals are
unprotected by law.
   ``Exotic animals can be kept at home if conditions are good. The
owner is responsible for security and the animal's actions,'' he
said.
   Gonzalez says he visits the homes of all his clients after they
buy their lions to make sure there are no problems.
   ``Lions are as loyal as dogs. In fact, I recommend getting a dog
to keep your lion company because they learn to play together,'' he
said.
   He said lions are no problem with children either, as long as
the animal is purchased ``when small, so they can get used to each
other.''
   And he says a lion-guarded home is a safe home.
   ``Thieves are smart. They always scope out their targets _ if
there's a lion on the premises they won't try robbing the house,''
he said.
   One happy customer is Ana Maria Conceicao de Oliveira, who lives
with her husband, 13-year-old daughter, and ``Mikey,'' the
20-month-old family lion, who occupies a large pen in the backyard.
   ``We bought Mikey to scare away burglars and I'm sure no thief
would enter our house. People around the neighborhood know we have
a lion so the word is out,'' she said.
   Her daughter, Raquel Christina, plays with the lion in the
backyard and feeds him a daily ration of 20 pounds of chicken
necks, lungs, hearts and kidneys.
   ``Burglars are afraid of dogs. Imagine how they would feel about
Mikey,'' she said.
   Gonzalez denies having any problems with customers, but the Rio
newspaper Jornal do Brasil reported at least one woman was unhappy
with her lion and resold it because he had ripped up her bathroom
when she gave him a bath.
   ``In practice, I learned that a lion is a lion and a dog is a
dog,'' said the woman, identified only as Maria Celia. ``A lion is
temperamental and difficult, very different from a puppy.''

   First, the Denver Zoo banned animal feeding. Then
a halt was put to ``exploitative'' rides on elephants and camels.
Now, an animal-rights group wants to stop balloon sales.
   ``Drifting balloons can find their way into many of the open-air
enclosures and can cause great harm, even death, to unsuspecting
animals who might ingest them,'' the Rocky Mountain Humane Society
wrote in a Feb. 6 letter to the zoo.
   The zoo's board of trustees stopped elephant and camel rides
this week after the humane society charged animals were being
exploited for human pleasure and greed.
   But enough is enough, zoo spokesman Tom Peterson said.
   ``We've never had a problem with balloons here,'' said Peterson.
``A lot of people are asking, `What will be left for the kids to do
that's fun?'''
   Robin Duxbury, a humane society member, said balloons are
overrated.
   ``What kind of lasting pleasure do kids get out of balloons
anyway?'' she said. ``Kids scream for them and their parents buy
them to shut them up.''

   Identical twin brothers charged with
killing a woman were placed in separate jails because authorities
feared their size _ each weighs about 300 pounds _ would enable
them to overpower guards.
   Pat Bondurant, 35, was placed in the Maury County Jail in
Columbia. His brother Pete was taken to the Lawrence County Jail in
nearby Lawrenceburg.
   Both jails are more secure than the Giles County Jail in
Pulaski, sheriff's investigator Mike Chapman said Wednesday.
   The twins were indicted Tuesday in the May 1986 slaying of
Gwendolyn Dugger, 23, of Elkmont, Ala. The grand jury has not

   The men were being held without bond and were scheduled for

   Another fugitive student leader of the crushed
pro-democracy movement has escaped China through an underground
railroad, which is still operating 10 months after the crackdown on
dissent, a reliable source said.
   ``I want everybody to know that the channel is still alive,
there's still hope,'' said the source, who is close to the
railroad. The source refused to be identified further and asked
that the date of the interview not be published, for security
reasons.
   He refused to divulge details of the escape route.
   The source said Wang Chaohua fled China on or about Jan. 7. She
was on a list of 21 students sought by the Chinese government for
leading demonstrations last spring for more freedom in the
Communist country. Wang, 38, was by far the oldest person on the
list and exerted a strong influence over the others.
   The source said he did not know where she has settled in the
West.
   The Chinese-language Hong Kong Economic Journal reported
Thursday that Wang had escaped to an unnamed destination and would
meet with other exiled dissidents at an ``appropriate'' time.
   The underground railroad brought out several prominent student
and intellectual dissidents soon after June 4, when the Chinese
army killed hundreds, if not thousands, of people in central
Beijing as it crushed the pro-democracy movement.
   In late December, China announced the arrests of five residents
of this British colony and of Macao, a nearby Portuguese enclave,
on charges of trying to smuggle dissidents out of the country. The
pro-democracy movement had widespread support in the territories,
which both revert to Chinese rule later this decade.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted police as saying the
arrests ``dealt a major blow to the overseas reactionary forces who
attempted to use Hong Kong and Macao as sanctuaries for criminals.''
   It said China would ``punish severely those who dare to plot and
ship wanted criminals out of the mainland.''
   But pro-democracy Chinese fugitives are continuing to reach the
West.
   Student leader Chai Ling and her husband, Feng Congde, recently
emerged in France after fleeing China about two weeks ago. Both
were on the most-wanted list.
   The source refused to comment when asked if the railroad played
a role in their escape. But he said the channel was responsible for
the escape of Wang and a few less prominent people this year. He
refused to name the others.
   The lengthy period the three student leaders were able to spend
as fugitives inside China would indicate there is still popular
support for the pro-democracy movement.
   Wang was a postgraduate student at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences. She played a role akin to that of senior adviser to other
movement leaders, who were much younger and generally less mature.
   Wang did not have the charisma that thrust other student
leaders, such as Wu'er Kaixi, into the international limelight. But
in private, she would speak passionately about democracy in China.
   The Hong Kong Economic Journal said Wang wanted to seek
democratic change through dialogue with the government. It said she
was opposed to the Tiananmen Square hunger strike that other
students called to press their demands.
   On the first night of the hunger strike last May, Wang sobbed in
the middle of the square as arguments raged around her over what
tactics students should take to keep the movement alive.
   Five of the 21 students on the wanted list are now known to have
escaped China to the West _ Wang, Chai, Feng, Wu'er and Li Lu.
   About 10 others are either known to be in jail _ including Wang
Dan, whose name topped the wanted list _ or are believed to have
been apprehended by authorities.
   When asked if he thought the underground railroad would be able
to bring any remaining fugitive student leaders out of the country,
the source said: ``I'm not optimistic and I'm not pessimistic. I'll
say the chances are 50-50.''

<TEXT>
   A fire accidentally started by a cigarette badly
damaged Ye Olde Cock, one of London's most famous taverns, police
said.
   Police said Thursday that two people and two dogs trapped on the
fifth floor of the building were brought safely down a ladder as
the blaze spread through the basement and first and second floors
of the pub on Fleet Street, which used to be London's newspaper row.
   A police spokeswoman, who by custom was not identified, said the
fire was caused by a ``carelessly discarded cigarette,'' which set
afire dust in the basement.
   The tavern has been at its present site on the south side of
Fleet Street since 1888. Its predecessor, opened in 1549, was on
the other side of the street.
   When the original was torn down, some of its old features were
preserved, including a beautifully carved chimney-piece from the
time of James I. The chimney-piece was built into the upstairs
dining room and many old oak fittings were used in the new building.

   President Bush is popular among a majority of
blacks, according to a CBS News-The New York Times poll released
Thursday.
   Bush has an approval rating of 56 percent among blacks, far
exceeding the 13 percent approval blacks gave his predecessor when
President Reagan was in office about the same amount of time, the
CBS Evening News reported.
   In May 1982, when Reagan had a 73 percent disapproval rate among
blacks, while the current poll indicated that 26 percent of blacks
disapproved of Bush, said Kathy Frankovic, of the network's polling
division.
   CBS-Times polls conducted during Reagan's entire time in office
found that he had an average 67 percent disapproval rate among
blacks, Frankovic said.
   For the last 30 years, five out of six blacks have voted for the
Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who the nominee was.
But CBS said Thursday's poll indicated that 9 percent of blacks
would vote for Bush if an election were held today while an
additional 20 percent said they would wait to see who the
Democratic nominee was before deciding.
   The current poll of 403 blacks was conducted between March 30
and April 2 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.

<HEAD>Gramm Accused of Erecting `Smokescreen' on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texan Phil Gramm, one of the Senate's most
ardent foes of abortion, is backing a proposal by home-state
Republicans that would ban most abortions only after pregnancies
pass the halfway mark.
   Yet Republican Gramm, who has co-sponsored five constitutional
amendments to ban abortions even in cases of rape or incest,
insists he isn't waffling.
   State Sen. Hugh Parmer, a pro-choice Democrat who is running
against Gramm, sees a ``smokescreen'' and is accusing Gramm of
trying to project a more moderate image on abortion to voters back
home without really changing his stance.
   The ``legislative action plan'' was issued last week by leaders
of the Texas Republican Party and endorsed by Gramm and GOP
gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams.
   Abortions would be prohibited ``when medical tests performed by
a licensed physician determine that the child is viable, except
when medically necessary to save the life of the mother.'' The plan
also calls for a ban on sex-selection abortions and advocates
parental consent before minors can obtain abortions.
   The party's focus on abortion comes as a number of Democratic
and Republican candidates around the country have moved away from
anti-abortion positions. Since anti-abortion candidates were
defeated in the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races last year,
there has been a growing perception that electoral majorities favor
legal abortions.
   Bill Price, president of the largest anti-abortion organization
in Texas, said he saw no compromise in the limited reach of the
Republican plan, but added: ``This is a recognition of political
reality.''
   Price, who heads Texans United for Life, acknowledged the
release of the plan was meant to coincide with the election season.
   ``Why should Republicans have the Democrats bang them over the
head'' on the abortion issue, he said.
   Phyllis Dunham, executive director of the Texas Abortion Rights
Action League, said the GOP proposal could backfire.
   ``The anti-choice Republicans won't think it goes far enough and
pro-choice Republicans will see right through it,'' Ms. Dunham
said. ``The pro-choice will see it for being a piece of political
maneuvering that it is.''
   Fred Meyer, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, said the
plan is a ``reasonable, responsible program'' that supports the
rights of the unborn as well as the rights of women.
   Meyer said Gramm's position on the constitutional amendments
stems from his national perspective, while the legislative action
plan addresses state-level issues.
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said the senator's position on
abortion remains unchanged and that the proposed constitutional
amendments ``speak for themselves.''
   But Dunham said Gramm seems to act more pro-choice when he's up
for re-election.
   ``I think the question which pro-choice Republicans will have to
ask themselves is: `Is Phil Gramm looking out for the lives of
Texans or is he looking out for his own political hide?''' she said.
   Parmer said Gramm's support of the GOP plan is an attempt to
confuse people because ``he knows his own position is totally
unacceptable to a vast majority of the voters in Texas.''
   ``He is prepared to take a position opposed by almost everybody
in Texas because he thinks it's good politics for him'' to maintain
conservative support around the nation in case he runs for
president in 1996, Parmer said.
   Three anti-abortion leaders in Texas endorsed the GOP plan this
week, saying it points the party in the right direction.
   ``If the people in the pro-life movement in Texas were to make a
wish list, we would ask for much more, but in today's political
climate and considering the strength of pro-abortionists with the
media and political left, we feel this legislative package is
immediately achievable,'' the three wrote.

   Almost 85 percent of a group of
prostitutes recently tested were found to carry the AIDS virus,
Kenya's health minister said.
   Health Minister Mwai Kibaki told parliament the results were
found in a random test of 200 prostitutes by government
researchers, the independent Daily Nation newspaper reported
Thursday. Kibaki gave no dates for the testing.
   Hundreds of prostitutes in Nairobi operate from bars, nightclubs
and homes catering to local residents and foreign tourists.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease caused by the
human immunodeficiency virus. The fatal disease attacks the body's
immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of
infections and cancers.
   A person can carry the AIDS virus without having AIDS, although
infection in almost all cases leads to a full-blown case of the
virus.
   The virus is transmitted primarily through sexual contact and
contaminated syringes.

   Imprisoned soul singer James Brown, who
billed himself as ``the hardest working man in show business,'' now
must work to persuade young people not to abuse illegal drugs the
way he did.
   Brown, 56, who has served 15 months of a six-year sentence on
charges stemming from a two-state car chase with police, was
transferred Thursday from state prison to the Lower Savannah Work
Release Center near Aiken.
   At the Aiken-Barnwell County Community Action Commission, Brown
will try to talk young people out of using drugs and alcohol, said
George Anderson, the agency's executive director.
   ``That name is going to bring the people out,'' Anderson said.
``His name alone can command a crowd.''
   During his four decades as a grunting, groaning, gyrating rhythm
and blues singer, Brown registered 114 charted singles such as
``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' ``Please, Please, Please'' ``I Got
You (I Feel Good),'' ``I'm Black And I'm Proud,'' and more
recently, ``Living in America.''
   The wavy-haired ``Godfather of Soul'' was arrested several times
for using illegal drugs before he was imprisoned in December 1988
to serve concurrent sentences in Georgia and South Carolina for
failing to stop for police, aggravated assault and weapons
violations.
   Tests showed Brown had used the powerful psychedelic drug
phencyclidine hydrochloride, or PCP.
   He becomes eligible for parole in South Carolina on May 5, 1991,
and in Georgia in March 1992.

   Dortch on Thursday asked U.S. District Judge Robert Potter to
reduce his sentence because of his cooperation with the government

Bakker.
   ``I'm very, very sorry,'' Dortch, 58, told the judge. ``Once

   Potter, known for his stiff sentences, said, ``I'm cognizant of
the fact that this is Rev. Dortch's last chance. I don't take it
lightly, and I'm not going to rule on it today.'' He said it could
be up to two weeks before he made a decision.
   Dortch was indicted in 1988 with Bakker on 24 counts of fraud
and conspiracy for soliciting $158 million from PTL supporters in
exchange for free lodging at the ministry's Christian retreat near

   The Indian peasant who tradition holds first
saw the Virgin of Guadalupe will be beautified during Pope John
Paul II's visit to Mexico, the archbishop of Mexico City said.
   The ceremony will be held during a Mass at the Basilica of
Guadalupe shortly after the pope arrives in Mexico on May 6,
Cardinal Ernesto Corripio Ahumada said Thursday at a news
conference.
   The ceremony is a step toward the canonization of Juan Diego, a
weaver of reed mats, who was born in 1474 and died in 1548.
   According to evidence presented to support Juan Diego's
canonization, the virgin appeared to him four times in Mexico City
in 1531 and cured his dying uncle.
   Tradition holds that when Diego opened his cloak to present
roses, blooming out of season, to the skeptical bishop as a sign of
the truth of his story, the flowers tumbled out and the virgin's
image appeared imprinted in their place.
   The cloak is on display at the basilica, built on the hill where
the virgin first appeared to Diego.
   Our Lady of Guadalupe is revered by Mexicans and other Latin
Americans who make pilgrimages to the shrine and bring tokens of
thanks for miracles they attribute to her.
   The pope's weeklong visit to Mexico is scheduled to end on May
13.

   President Bush will have to use prescription
eye drops the rest of his life to control glaucoma in his left eye,
the White House says, but he is not expected to suffer vision
problems.
   Bush's eye problem, characterized by the White House as ``an
early glaucoma,'' was diagnosed during his routine annual physical
examination on Thursday.
   If not detected early and properly treated, the condition,
stemming from pressure in the eye, can lead to blindness.
   But in Bush's case, there has been no visual impairment. Doctors
said none should be anticipated.
   The 65-year-old president was pronounced otherwise ``in
excellent health'' by his personal physician, Dr. Burton Lee. ``He
continues to keep extremely fit through vigorous physical
activities,'' Lee said in a statement.
   Asked about the glaucoma at a photo session after he returned
from the four-hour physical at Bethesda Naval Medical Center in
suburban Maryland, Bush said:
   ``I haven't felt a thing, felt it at all. I'm taking drops now
... one in the morning and one at night, but the vision is very
good.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Dr. Lee
does not anticipate any future problems'' with the president's
vision.
   Glaucoma expert Dr. Mansour Armaly concurred, although he did
not examine the president.
   Armaly, chairman of ophthalmology at George Washington
University Medical Center here, said in a telephone interview that
early detection is the key to controlling glaucoma.
   Bush is taking Betagan eye drops twice a day and will do so
permanently, aides said. Betagan is the brand name for the
betablocker drug levobunolol. Similar to betablockers that treat
arterial high blood pressure, it lowers the ocular pressure, Armaly
said.
   Glaucoma stems from abnormally high pressure of the fluid within
the eye and is not uncommon for a person of Bush's age. It has no
cure, and if the drugs fail to control it, surgery is an option,
according to doctors.
   Bush's eye-drop therapy is standard for glaucoma, and proper
treatment should keep his eye from going blind to the disease, said
Dr. M. Bruce Shields of the Duke University Eye Center in Durham,
N.C.
   ``He probably will have to use medicines the rest of his life.
It's not something you can treat and then it's gone,'' said
Shields, who is chairman of the glaucoma committee of the National
Society to Prevent Blindness.
   Shields also said that once glaucoma is found in one eye it
often appears in the other. But treatment can also save the sight
in the second eye, he said.
   Bush has had a stye in his right eye for the past week, but it
is nearly gone after treatments with soaks and antibiotics,
Fitzwater said.
   Doctors also found ``mild degenerative osteoarthritis'' in the
president's hips and neck, which has been also detected in past
years.
   The White House said he also underwent chest X-rays, which were
normal; an electrocardiogram and stress tests, which were normal;
urinalysis showing no abnormality; blood tests, which were normal;
and a dermatology exam, showing ``no significant problem or
change.''
   ``His allergy problems remain minimal and unchanged,'' Fitzwater
said.

<HEAD>Proposal to Seize Evidence Without Subpoena Gets Cold Reception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An FBI proposal to allow agents to seize some
evidence in criminal investigations without a subpoena is meeting
resistance from the Justice Department, Capitol Hill and civil
libertarians.
   ``This would give far too much power to individual FBI agents,''
said Rep. Don Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee
on civil and constitutional rights and a former agent himself.
   ``It's every agent's dream but it's subject to too much abuse,''
the California Democrat said Thursday.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said prosecutors who
have been discussing the proposal with the FBI are concerned the
proposed expanded powers might go too far.
   Under the proposal, FBI agents would be allowed to seize
documents such as office and bank files and other records without a
grand jury subpoena issued through a Justice Department prosecutor
and without a search warrant. They would need only an
administrative summons that they could issue on their own.
   However, law enforcement officials still would have to obtain a
court-approved search warrant before they could enter a person's
home or office without the person's approval.
   Colleen O'Connor of the American Civil Liberties Union
criticized the proposal, saying, ``If the Justice Department goes
in that direction, we don't expect it to last long without a court
challenge.
   ``We've seen a pattern of the government attempting to change
its own rules of operating ... and this is another indication of
it,'' she said. ``That's why we have courts.''
   The comments followed a New York Times report on the proposal
Thursday.
   The FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration got the expanded
authority for drug investigations several years ago.
   In 1987, the FBI also got the right to secretly obtain bank
records without a warrant in investigations of foreign spies upon
certification by the FBI director.
   ``At this point, we're exploring the possibility of extending
that to other criminal matters,'' said FBI spokesman Mike Kortan.
   The FBI believes such authority, carefully limited by statute
and regulations, ``would be a useful investigative tool which would
not pose any threat to individual privacy,'' Kortan said.
   He said the expanded authority would save time during
investigations, eliminating the need for agents to travel long
distances to secure a subpoena.
   The FBI first proposed the expansion of authority in 1988, said
a congressional source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Their proposal has been bottled up in the Justice
Department,'' specifically in the U.S. Attorneys' Advisory
Committee, the source said, adding that a ``turf battle'' is to
blame for the lack of action.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has not gotten involved in
discussions between the FBI and the prosecutors' committee, Runkel
said.
   ``If it gets to him, he will get involved,'' he said. ``It may
be resolved prior to getting to him.''
   Legislation to give the FBI the expanded authority only for bank
and savings and loan investigations was proposed as part of the S&amp;L
bailout bill passed by Congress last year.
   However, Edwards and several other congressmen objected, saying
it would give individual FBI agents too much authority, and the
measure was dropped.
   No legislation on the proposal is currently before Congress.
   The congressional source, who supports the proposal, said the
FBI needs the expanded authority, at least for financial
institution investigations, because there are ``more than 2,000
bank fraud and S&amp;L cases languishing because the FBI doesn't have
enough people.''

<HEAD>Three Top Tuna Canners Won't Use Tuna Captured With Dolphins</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists and lawmakers are hailing a
decision by three U.S. tuna canners _ including the world's largest
_ not to buy or sell tuna captured along with dolphins.
   Environmental groups predicted the move by companies selling the
StarKist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea brands will save some
of the estimated 100,000 dolphins that die annually in huge nets
used to catch schools of tuna.
   StarKist Seafood Co. said Thursday it ``will not purchase any
tuna caught in association with dolphins'' and ``will sell only
dolphin-free tuna.''
   The action was taken in ``recognition of increased consumer
concern for the environment'' and because ``the greatest concern in
the tuna industry is dolphin mortality,'' said Anthony A.F.
O'Reilly, president of the H.J. Heinz Co., which owns StarKist.
   StarKist has a 35 percent share of the U.S. tuna market and is
the world's largest tuna canner. The change could cost consumers
``a couple or more cents'' per can, O'Reilly said.
   Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc., a chief competitor, followed suit a
few hours later saying it ``would now implement its plan to end the
purchase of tuna caught in association with dolphin.''
   ``Our tuna cans will begin to reflect the dolphin-safe label in
U.S. stores within the next three months,'' the statement said.
   Van Kamp Seafood of St. Louis, seller of Chicken of the Sea
brand, said it would ``discontinue buying tuna caught in
association with dolphins,'' according to a statement from Jose E.
Munoz Jr., company president.
   ``To do this, we are asking our few existing contract vessels to
relocate their operations to the western Pacific, where the dolphin
mortality problem does not exist,'' Munoz said.
   Leslie Scheele of the environmental group Greenpeace, which
backs a worldwide boycott of tuna caught with nets, said the action
could ``finally end the killing of dolphins by tuna nets forever.
Others are going to have to follow suit.''
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who is sponsoring legislation to
require canners to label tuna that is caught by nets that ensnare
dolphins, said the announcement made StarKist ``not only the
largest but the most enlightened'' tuna canner in the world.''
   ``Now Charlie the Tuna has a reason to smile,'' said Rep.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., author of the Dolphin Protection Consumer
Information Act of 1990, in a statement read by Biden. Charlie the
Tuna is an animated character used in StarKist advertisements.
   ``I think it means defining a new corporate ethics for the '90s
in America,'' said Sam LaBudde, a biologist who gained prominence
in 1987 when he sailed for five months undercover as a crewman
aboard a foreign fishing boat. He brought back graphic film footage
of dolphin kills during tuna catches.
   However, the American Tunaboat Association criticized the new
policy as ``politically and marketing motivated.''
   August Felando, ATA president, said the move was ``devastating''
for the U.S. tuna fleet. ``Basically, we have now lost our market.
The Eastern Pacific is the most productive area in the world for
yellowfin tuna fishing and it's our traditional grounds,'' he said.
   ``U.S. boats ... will be forced to other fisheries, or even go
out of business,'' while foreign boats will sell their tuna to
non-U.S. buyers, Felando added.
   Starkist's new policy was aimed at purse seine net fishing in
the eastern Pacific Ocean because it is the only fishery where
dolphin swim with tuna. The nets are intentionally dropped below
schools of dolphins to capture the tuna underneath when a
drawstring is pulled to close the net.
   But the company said it also would continue to refuse to buy
fish caught anywhere with gill or driftnets.
   Gill or driftnets are set on the water overnight and trap
anything _ fish, birds and other marine life _ that enters the area
covered by the net.
   Experts say most of the approximately 2 million tons of tuna
caught worldwide each year is caught in purse sein nets without
snaring dolphins. Ten percent is caught using driftnets or
encircling dolphins in purse sein nets.
   The United States, the only country that regulates dolphin
mortality in connection with fishing, allows a maximum of 20,500
deaths and stations observers on board all U.S.-flagged vessels to
verify the number of deaths.

<HEAD>Wool, Mohair Payments Fleecing Taxpayers, Critics Say</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wool and mohair producers are collecting $100
million in support payments under a controversial program critics
say should be revised or scrapped.
   Others contend the National Wool Act of 1954 has stemmed the
downward plunge in U.S. wool production and has helped keep
thousands of small producers in business by providing payments when
market prices are low.
   The Agriculture Department announced Thursday that the $100
million in payments for 1989, which are to begin immediately, will
be split equally between wool and mohair producers.
   Last year's federal support level for shorn wool was $1.77 per
pound, but the national average market price was only $1.24 per
pound. Mohair supports were set at nearly $4.59 per pound, while
the 1989 average market price was $1.58 per pound.
   The USDA announcement on wool and mohair subsidies followed a
report this week by the General Accounting Office urging that ``the
Congress should consider the need for the wool and mohair program''
as lawmakers draft the 1990 farm bill.
   Since price supports for wool and mohair were established in
1954, federal subsidies to producers have totaled about $2 billion,
the GAO said.
   When Congress wrote the law, wool was considered a strategic
material required for national security. It has not been classified
as such since 1960, said the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   One of the objectives was to encourage the production of wool in
such a way as to ``assure a viable domestic industry,'' the report
said.
   Although mohair _ which is clipped from Angora goats _ was not
included in the wool program's broad objectives, the law also
includes mohair in its payment provisions.
   The GAO reported in 1982 that despite subsidies, U.S. wool
production has continued to decline. And the new report, which was
prepared at the request of Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said
those findings are still valid.
   ``From 1981 through 1988, about $665 million in wool payments
were made,'' the report said. ``During this period, domestic wool
production continued its more-than-30-year decline, from 110
million pounds in 1981 to 89 million pounds in 1988.''
   But the GAO acknowledged that studies by the industry and others
show that wool payments have provided income assurance to
producers, have had a stabilizing effect on the industry and have
helped slow the decline in U.S. wool production.
   Even so, GAO estimated that in 1988 the additional output of
wool attributable to the program cost taxpayers $3.04 per pound,
while the average market price of wool produced that year was only
$1.38 per pound.
   The report said that USDA wool payments in 1986 _ the most
recent year available to investigators _ totaled $104 million and
were made to 125,378 producers.
   Of the total, 51,868 payments were less than $100 each,
representing more than 41 percent of the total. More than 102,000
were less than $500 each, representing almost 82 percent of the
1986 total.
   But in dollars, those $500-or-less payments made up only 13.4
percent of the $104 million total. The biggest category for payment
size was in the $1,000-to-$25,000 range, in which 12,209 producers
collected $48.5 million, or about 47 percent of the year's total.
   Payments of more than $25,000 went to 673 producers, who got
$34.4 million, or 33 percent of the total.
   Although there was no comparable breakdown for mohair, the GAO
report showed that mohair payments in 1986 totaled $42.7 million
and have increased significantly since then.
   In 1988, mohair producers collected $47.1 million, compared with
$41.4 million for wool. That was the first time since the program
began that mohair payments exceeded wool subsidies.
   The report said there are only about 12,000 mohair producers _
roughly one-tenth the number of wool producers _ and that their
payments in 1988 averaged about $3,925 each, compared with $360 for
wool.
   Most of the wool payments of less than $100 are concentrated in
the Midwest and the Southwest, the report said. Thus, elimination
of the program would affect producers in those areas more than
others.
   According to the director of the Navajo Wool and Mohair
Marketing Industry in Shiprock, N.M., an estimated 10,000 to 15,000
sheep producers are located on the Navajo reservation.
   ``While not all of those producers receive wool program
payments, about 7,000 to 10,000 do, and each maintains an average
of about 20 sheep,'' the report said. ``The director said that
about 90 percent of the participating producers receive wool
payments of less than $100 each year.''
   Most of these producers are in the Four Corners area of Arizona,
New Mexico, Utah and Colorado, and ``elimination of the small
payments would likely have a detrimental effect on them,'' the
report said.
   ``Furthermore,'' it added, ``because most of the lamb meat
produced is used by the Navajos as a food source, wool sales
combine with the wool payments general provide the principal income
derived from their sheep.''
   The GAO also was told by a spokesman for the Wool Forum Inc. of
Henning, Minn., that the small payments ``are a worthwhile
investment in the wool industry of the future'' because many new
producers are from non-farm backgrounds and are reluctant to risk
large investment because of their lack of experience.
   ``In his opinion, the wool program adds that little extra
financial encouragement that makes these new producers go ahead
with their investments,'' the GAO said.

<HEAD>VA Seeking Pay Boost to Cut Losses of Nurses</HEAD>

   The Veterans Affairs Department is moving to
head off a loss of registered nurses with legislation that would
bring their pay in line with what nurses elsewhere receive.
   By introducing its bill this week, the VA also is moving the
Bush administration closer to embracing competitive pay for all
government employees.
   Federal agencies have been looking at competitive or locality
pay as a means of recruiting and keeping workers.
   Competitive pay bases salaries on current rates paid in a
community for comparable positions. The federal Office of Personnel
Management has proposed a system that includes adjustments for
local pay but also, for certain employees, links pay raises to job
performance.
   The House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees have separate
proposals for raising nursing pay as well.
   Under the new bill, a VA hospital, nursing home or other
facility would be able to use pay data from non-VA facilities in an
area to establish ``community rates.'' The community rates would be
paid only if those local rates exceed the national pay scale for VA
nurses.
   The VA employs 35,000 registered nurses at its hospitals,
clinics and nursing homes, making it the largest such employer in
the country.
   The nationally set base pay for a VA registered nurse is
$18,174. The American Nurses Association says the national average
starting pay for a registered nurse is $25,261.
   The VA already has been able to adjust pay to meet local rates,
but the process is so slow that the agency's salary levels still
fall behind those of private employers.
   The department was paying special rates at 130 of its 172
medical centers a year ago, Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J.
Derwinski said in a letter accompanying his legislative proposal.
   ``Even with the special rates, VA has not been able to offer
competitive salaries at certain geographic locations'' such as
Boston, Southern California and New York City, Derwinski said.

   East Germany's first freely elected
government is destined to become a historical footnote, a
negotiating team chosen by voters to dissolve their country.
   Parliament's decision to put in power the government of Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere was not contingent on a vision for East
Germany's future, but a blueprint for its demise.
   De Maiziere, who managed to build a coalition government
encompassing most of the major political factions, has but one
mandate: lead East Germany to a merger with West Germany.
   But his decision to cobble together a united front of
wide-ranging opinions was a masterstroke that may give West Germany
less room to dictate the terms and timing of unification.
   As the diverse composition of de Maiziere's government
indicates, no longer is the infant known as East German democracy
willing to toddle into the waiting arms of the West German
fatherland without asking for a bigger allowance.
   De Maiziere and his Christian Democrat coalition, which finished
ahead in East Germany's first free elections on March 18, have kept
their promise to voters to seek unification as quickly as possible.
   But on Thursday, they joined with the left-leaning Social
Democrats in a broad coalition government that will present a
united East German front at the negotiating table.
   The very existence of the coalition acknowledges a growing fear
among East Germans who, once starstruck by the prospect of sharing
West German wealth, are now grappling with the reality of
abandoning a vast welfare system for the wilds of the free market.
   De Maiziere already has begun distancing himself somewhat from
his political mentor, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   He assumed a tougher negotiating posture just hours after
Parliament named him prime minister, saying on West German
television that unification may not come next year, as Kohl has
said.
   He said he wants to make sure East Germans, dependent on heavy
social benefits, are not disadvantaged by the process.
   He even portrayed East Germany as the proverbial David to West
Germany's Goliath.
   The 50-year-old lawyer and former viola player presented an
image far different from the man who campaigned across the East
German countryside this year with Kohl, willingly giving center
stage to the West German chancellor.
   The wide-ranging agreement on which de Maiziere has built his
coalition still includes major points the Bonn government is
demanding.
   It says that the countries must be merged en masse, not one East
German state at a time, and that a united Germany should remain
part of NATO. It also says the monetary systems must be merged by
July 1, as Kohl has demanded.
   But it also includes many of the demands of East Germany's
Social Democrats, who have close ties to Kohl's main opposition,
the West German Social Democrats.
   The East German agreement demands East Germans accustomed to
cheap food, cheap homes and government jobs receive broad housing
and employment guarantees.
   It also demands most East German marks be traded at a 1-1
exchange rate when the currencies are merged, rather than the 2-1
rate recommended by the West German central bank.
   Even the commitment to NATO membership hedges. The accord says
membership should be temporary, and NATO troops should not be based
in what is now East Germany, a nod to the Soviets, who want a
neutral Germany.
   The coalition agreement also declares that Germany should not
seek to reclaim former German lands ceded to Poland after World War
II.
   That is something Kohl has not been willing to guarantee, as he
courts arch-conservatives before West German elections in December.
He is likely to face a stiff challenge from the West German Social
Democrats.
   De Maiziere has had to fight the perception he is a puppet of
Kohl, and his tough comments may just be pre-negotiation bombast
and political expediency aimed at calming the fears of an
increasingly worried populace.
   But by forging a coalition with the Social Democrats, de
Maiziere has made a break with Bonn and acknowledged a growing fear
that East Germans could become a second-class tier of a new German
society.
   Now, Kohl may have to try to cut a deal with his own Social
Democrats when he negotiates with the East Germans.
   Neither West German party wants to alienate West German voters
who fear higher taxes and interest rates and deflated buying power
as they bail out the doddering East German economy.
   De Maiziere, meanwhile, can head to the bargaining table knowing
that while unification is inevitable, the price just may be
negotiable.

   A play about a sharecropper whose grandfather
was a slave, a novel about Cuban musicians in New York and poetry
by a Yugoslavian immigrant won Pulitzer Prizes.
   The 21 prizewinners Thursday also included two California
newspapers, for their coverage of the Oct. 17 earthquake, and three
newspapers awarded for reporting health threats _ in a city's water
supply, in a dietary supplement and in blood supplies.
   The seven arts and 14 journalism prizes awarded by Columbia
University carried $3,000 prizes, except for the public service
award of a gold medal.
   Oscar Hijuelos won the fiction award for ``The Mambo Kings Play
Songs of Love,'' about musician brothers from Havana whose claim to
fame is performing on an episode of ``I Love Lucy.''
   Hijuelos, the son of Cuban immigrants, said he hoped the prize
would encourage publishers to carry more works by ethnic minorities.
   The drama prize went to August Wilson for ``The Piano Lesson,''
about a sharecropper willing to sell the family piano to buy land
his grandfather worked on as a slave. Wilson, author of a series of
plays about black life in America, won a Pulitzer in 1987 for
``Fences.''
   Charles Simic, who left Yugoslavia as a teen-ager, won for his
book of humorous prose poems, ``The World Doesn't End.''
   Among the book's images is this: ``The dead man steps down from
the scaffold. He holds his bloody head under his arm ... he takes a
seat at one of the tables and orders two beers, one for him and one
for his head.''
   The general non-fiction award went to ``And Their Children After
Them,'' by Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson. The book revisits
the children of poor Alabamans profiled 50 years ago by James Agee
and Walker Evans in their classic book, ``Let Us Now Praise Famous
Men.''
   The other arts Pulitzers went to ``Machiavelli in Hell'' by
Sebastian de Grazia, for biography; ``Duplicates,'' a concerto for
two pianos and orchestra by Mel Powell, for music; and ``In Our
Image: America's Empire in the Philippines,'' by Stanley Karnow,
for history.
   Jim Murray, the Los Angeles Times sports columnist, became the
fourth sportswriter to win the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.
   The Washington (N.C.) Daily News won for an expose of
carcinogens in the city water.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer won for a probe that found the blood
industry is little regulated. It was the Inquirer's 17th Pulitzer,
its 11th in the past six years, and the second for reporter Gilbert
M. Gaul, who won an investigative reporting Pulitzer in 1979.
   Tamar Stieber's reports for the Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on
the link between the dietary supplement L-tryptophan and a rare
blood disorder won a Pulitzer for specialized reporting and led to
a national recall of the product.
   The general news reporting prize went to the staff of the San
Jose Mercury News, which published with the aid of emergency
generators after the San Francisco Bay Area earthquake. The spot
news photography prize went to The Tribune of Oakland, Calif., for
pictures of the quake's devastation.
   David C. Turnley of the Detroit Free Press won the feature
photography prize for a portfolio called ``The Year in
Revolution,'' including images from China, Czechoslovakia, Romania
and the Berlin Wall.
   Lou Kilzer and Chris Ison of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St.
Paul won the investigative reporting prize for exposing the St.
Paul fire chief's alleged ties to people who profited from arson.
   Four reporters for The Seattle Times _ Ross Anderson, Bill
Dietrich, Mary Ann Gwinn and Eric Nalder _ received the national
reporting award for coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   Announcement of the awards set champagne corks popping in
newsrooms around the country.
   ``We haven't had this much excitement in this town since the
Union cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each other up Main
Street in 1862,'' said Bill Coughlin, the Washington Daily News's
executive editor.
   ``Great Wall wine'' was all they could get in Beijing to
celebrate the international reporting award for Nicholas D. Kristof
and his wife Sheryl WuDunn of The New York Times. They won for
coverage of the pro-democracy movement in China and its suppression.
   For his feature writing award, Dave Curtin of the Colorado
Springs Gazette Telegraph profiled a family that was struggling to
recover from an explosion that devastated their home and left them
severely burned.
   Other winners included:
   _David A. Vise and Steve Coll of The Washington Post, for
explanatory journalism, for their reports about the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   _Allan Temko of the San Francisco Chronicle, for criticism.
``Did I win?'' asked the architectural critic. ``How extraordinary.
I've always been a bridesmaid.''
   _Thomas J. Hylton of The Mercury of Pottstown, Pa., for
editorial writing about a local bond issue for the preservation of
farmland and other open space.
   _Tom Toles of The Buffalo News for editorial cartoons.

   Millions of Americans haven't sent back their
census forms. Millions of others didn't get forms in the first
place. Local governments are suing the Census Bureau.
   All in all, the 1990 national head count is off to a rough start.
   Years went into the planning before roughly 100 million census
forms were sent to households at the end of March.
   Promptly, things started to go wrong.
   Forms began pouring into the bureau's Jeffersonville, Ind.,
clearinghouse. But they weren't completed responses from citizens.
They were undeliverable forms being returned by the post office.
   Census Director Barbara Bryant estimated Thursday that between 4
million and 4.5 million forms were undeliverable for various
reasons, largely incorrect addresses.
   That is being fixed by sending out workers to hand-deliver
forms, she said.
   But even many of those who received their forms haven't
cooperated, Bryant said, pleading with those who haven't filled
them out and mailed them back to ``do it now.''
   If the response doesn't pick up, she said, the price of taking
the count could escalate by $80 million.
   Bryant said that so far only 57 percent of the forms delivered
to American homes have been returned.
   At that rate, she said, the total will be only 62 percent by the
time the bureau starts sending workers out to count those who
haven't answered, starting before the end of April.
   Officials had hoped to get back 70 percent of the forms, and
Bryant said counting people ``on the doorstep'' will cost an extra
$10 million for each percentage point below that level. The census
already is expected to cost $2.5 billion.
   Wisconsin is leading the states with a 73.4 percent return rate,
while Alaska is last at 44.2 percent, she said.
   Among major cities, Indianapolis has a relatively high 66.7
percent return rate and Boston only 41.7 percent.
   Others include New York, Atlanta, 57.2 percent; Chicago, 49.3;
Dallas, 53.5; Denver, 55.9; Detroit, 53.7; Kansas City, 51.1; Los
Angeles, 51.5; Memphis, 58.2; Minneapolis-St. Paul, 62.8; New
Orleans, 44.3; New York, 46.9; Philadelphia, 52.6; Phoenix, 46.0;
and Seattle, 57.4.
   The lagging response is only the most recent problem facing the
nation's 21st national head count.
   Addressing trouble meant that 4 million to 4.5 million people
failed to get forms at all _ a difficulty Bryant said is being
handled by hand-delivery of forms. That is still less than the 5
percent to 6 percent rate of nondeliverable mail sent out by
commercial firms, she said.
   Several local governments announced Wednesday that they were
filing suit, charging that the results _ whatever they are _ will
be unfair.
   Census figures are used to distribute seats in the House of
Representatives and to allocate billions of dollars in federal
funds.
   The cities and other local governments that sued contended their
residents will not be fully counted, resulting in a loss of
representation and money.
   New York City was joined in the suit by Chicago, Los Angeles,
Houston and Dade County, Fla., as well as the state of California,
the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the NAACP and the League of United
Latin American Citizens.
   Among the reported problems:
   _More than 100,000 forms in San Antonio and south Texas couldn't
be delivered because of incorrect addresses, said Sen Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, who also complained of a shortage of
Spanish-language forms.
   _In many communities like Ross, Calif., that still get their
mail in post office boxes, the census forms had only street
addresses _ so the post office returned them.
   _In New York City, forms sent to some giant apartment buildings
failed to include apartment numbers. Without the numbers, mailmen
couldn't deliver them to the residents. Some forms were reportedly
left in lobbies.
   _In Los Angeles, city attorney James Hahn estimated that the
bureau had missed entire city blocks and apartment complexes, with
up to 70,000 forms being sent back because of wrong addresses.
   _Toll-free phone lines for people to call in were jammed and had
to be expanded last week.

   Identical twin brothers charged with
killing a woman were placed in separate jails because authorities
feared their size _ each weighs about 300 pounds _ would enable
them to overpower guards.
   Pat Bondurant, 35, was placed in the Maury County Jail in
Columbia. His brother Pete was taken to the Lawrence County Jail in
nearby Lawrenceburg.
   Both jails are more secure than the Giles County Jail in
Pulaski, sheriff's investigator Mike Chapman said Wednesday.
   The twins were indicted Tuesday in the May 1986 slaying of
Gwendolyn Dugger, 23, of Elkmont, Ala. The grand jury has not
released details on the slaying.
   The men were being held without bond and were scheduled for
arraignment April 23.

   Former Gov. Arch A. Moore, a Republican
who served three terms in a heavily Democratic state, could serve
up to 36 years in prison for kickbacks, coverups and other crimes
committed in his last term and two campaigns.
   His Democratic successor, Gov. Gaston Caperton, said Moore's
decision Thursday to plead guilty to five federal charges helps
explain the state's current severe financial woes.
   ``I am confident that West Virginians will realize that not only
did I inherit a government that was financially bankrupt, but
ethically bankrupt as well,'' Caperton said.
   ``This is a tragic day for West Virginia,'' Caperton added.
   A grand jury indicted Moore on Thursday and he signed a plea
agreement later in the day, U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said. He
said Moore had agreed to help prosecutors in other, unspecified
corruption probes.
   Moore, the charismatic, silver-haired patriarch of the state
GOP, admitted to extortion, mail and tax fraud to get elected in
1984, during his term as governor and in his unsuccessful 1988
re-election campaign, Carey said.
   Moore also admitted blocking a federal grand jury investigation
of him during 1989 and 1990.
   ``This news will be greeted with a great joy by some in the
state of West Virginia,'' Moore said in a statement. ``There will
be others who will be sincerely grieved by reason of their devotion
to me and my family. I know I have their understanding and love.''
   Moore, who turns 67 on Monday, faces up to 36 years in prison
and $1.25 million in fines. Carey said Moore should appear in court
within two weeks.
   Many West Virginia politicians have either become involved in
corruption scandals or resigned recently. Since December 1988, a
state attorney general, a state treasurer, two state Senate
presidents, a Senate majority leader, a top aide to a Senate
president, a House member and two lobbyists have lost their jobs.
   It is the second time Moore has been indicted by a federal grand
jury for alleged wrongdoing in office.
   Moore was governor from 1969 to 1977 but was constitutionally
barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He and his 1972
campaign manager were indicted in December 1975 on a charge of
extorting $25,000 from a businessman seeking a state charter for a
new bank. Both were acquitted in 1976.
   The indictment said Moore used his position to extort $573,721
in October 1985 from Maben Energy Corp. of Beckley, a coal mining
and processing company, and H. Paul Kizer, the company's chairman.
   Moore allegedly agreed to help Kizer and Maben Energy receive a
refund of more than $2 million from the state's black lung fund,
which provides benefits to coal miners with the respiratory
disease. In return, Moore received a 25 percent kickback, the
indictment said.
   It said Moore created fake, backdated documents purporting to be
legitimate ``contingent fee'' legal agreements to cover up the
extortion.
   The indictment also said Moore filed false federal income tax
returns for 1984 and 1985, failing to report $72,500 in income, and
that he defrauded the state of his salary and benefits by funneling
about $100,000 into his 1984 campaign fund.
   It said Moore committed the crimes to influence votes and win
the governor's race.
   Moore also agreed to plead guilty to one count of obstruction of
justice. The indictment said he falsified documents, tried to
persuade witnesses to lie to a grand jury and lied in an interview
with federal investigators.
   In early January 1990, Moore met with former aide and 1988
campaign manager John Leaberry. ``Unknown to Moore, his meeting
with Leaberry was recorded,'' Carey said.
   Moore allegedly told Leaberry that he had received and used
illegal cash in the 1988 campaign and told Leaberry how they would
both falsely deny the existence of the cash, the prosecutor said.
   Moore first was elected to the House of Delegates in 1952. He
won a seat in the U.S. House in 1956, serving six two-year terms
before his first gubernatorial bid in 1968.
   Democrats hold a 2-to-1 edge in registration in West Virginia.

   Once barred by the Communists from a
high-school diploma, Markus Meckel worked as a janitor and read
Nietzsche to pass the time. Now, the 37-year-old East German is
Europe's youngest foreign minister.
   The lumbering, bearded Lutheran Church pastor in many ways
symbolizes the changes that thrust some of the country's political
outcasts into power after last year's revolution.
   Just days before East Germany's historic elections on March 18,
reporters could easily find Meckel, dressed in baggy trousers and
an outdoorsman's ribbed sweater, for a chat about communism's
demise.
   More recently the foreign minister, who now sports a
chalk-striped suit, has dealt with journalists peppering him with
questions about the country's headlong rush to German unification.
   The democratically elected Parliament approved Meckel and the
rest of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's Cabinet late Thursday.
   Difficult negotiations with U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and other
leading diplomats are on Meckel's agenda.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt says the dramatic changes in
Meckel's life would have been ``difficult to even dream about''
weeks ago when he was still the second-ranking official in the
Social Democratic Party.
   Meckel stepped into the left-leaning party's top spot on March
26 after his predecessor, Ibrahim Boehme, was forced out by
accusations he cooperated with the former secret police. Boehme and
Meckel helped found the party last year.
   That left to Meckel the difficult task of forming a coalition
with the Christian Democrats while he and other party leaders were
still reeling from the unexpected conservative romp at the polls
last month.
   Meckel has one main goal _ speedy unification with West Germany,
although he and others of the country's young democratic leadership
face an uncertain political future after the states are joined.
   Meckel was born Aug. 18, 1952, near Frankfurt an der Oder along
the Polish border.
   His resistance to the former hard-line Communist rulers kept him
from a high school diploma, so he took the path preferred by many
like-minded young people. He studied theology under the auspices of
the relatively independent Lutheran Church from 1971 to 1978.
   After finishing his training in Berlin, Meckel worked as a
janitor and caretaker for two years. During that time, he told
reporters, he avidly read two of the major German philosophers.
   ``As a janitor, he read Hegel and Nietzsche. Now, he can put his
own ideas into practice,'' wrote the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper.
   Meckel served as a church pastor in the northern village of
Vipperow from 1982 to 1988. More recently, he has run an ecumenical
meeting and education center in the western city of Magdeburg.
   He is married for the second time and has two children.
   East Germany's government continues to have close ties to the
Lutheran Church, which helped lead the nation's peaceful revolution
last year.
   Another Lutheran pastor, Rainer Eppelmann, heads the disarmament
and defense ministry.

<HEAD>Atwater Out of Hospital and Back `In Fighting Trim'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Matalin's home phone rang at a quarter to
seven. ``Hey, what's movin'?'' asked the familiar, raspy voice.
Calling from his New York hospital room, Lee Atwater was hungry for
the latest political news.
   The early morning phone calls to the Republican Party's chief of
staff aren't likely to let up now that party chairman Atwater is
back home after 10 days in New York where he underwent treatment
for a brain tumor.
   Not for two or three months will doctors know how effective the
latest treatment was for the tumor described as ``aggressive and
dangerous'' by Dr. Paul Kornblith.
   Experts at treating such tumors have said the five-year survival
rate can range from 50 percent to as low as 10 percent, depending
on a range of characteristics.
   Kornblith, who led the team that treated Atwater at Montefiore
Medical Center in New York, maintained a firmly optimistic attitude.
   ``He's in fighting trim and ready to fight the wars of his
profession,'' Kornblith said Thursday shortly before releasing
Atwater from the hospital.
   The doctor predicted the GOP chairman would resume ``working to
some degree probably next week.''
   Atwater aides and friends described him as maintaining his
interest in political developments even while hospitalized.
   Matalin said the early morning call from Atwater was typical and
that they talked up to six times a day. The party chairman was
eager to get the latest news of the vicious gubernatorial primary
between Texas Democrats or the developments in Florida where former
Democrat Lawton Chiles was rumored to be planning a challenge to
Republican Gov. Bob Martinez. The former senator entered the race
on Thursday.
   Invariably, Atwater would start the conversation by asking,
``What's moving?'' she said, his way of asking what was happening.
   There also were the calls from President Bush and Donald Trump,
the book from Richard M. Nixon, the visits from Cabinet members
like Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
   Nixon sent Atwater a copy of his new book, ``In the Arena.'' It
was inscribed: ``To Lee Atwater. I can't think of anyone I'd rather
be in the arena with.''
   While Atwater was in the hospital, the rhythm and blues album on
which he plays guitar and sings with such stars as B.B. King, Isaac
Hayes and Billy Preston reached stores in the nation's capital. It
quickly sold out.
   Sally Atwater was due to give birth to the couple's third child.
   Atwater's ordeal began March 6 when he collapsed during a speech
at a political breakfast. Doctors at George Washington University
Medical Center found a small tumor on the right frontal lobe of his
brain, an astrocytoma, which they said was nonmalignant and could
easily be treated by radiation.
   That early diagnosis proved overly optimistic. The tumor grew
and the effect was felt on Atwater's left side.
   The 39-year-old party chairman appeared at the White House with
Clayton Williams immediately after Williams won the Republican
nomination for governor of Texas.
   When they came out of the West Wing, reporters were startled by
Atwater's appearance. He was pale and was dragging his left foot.
   Asked about the daily radiation treatments he was receiving,
Atwater said he felt like doctors were ``putting me in a Xerox
machine.''
   Within days he was back in the hospital. Aides said he was
suffering from an imbalance in medication he was receiving to
prevent seizures and combat nausea from the radiation treatments.
   A week later he flew to New York to go under Kornblith's care.
   Matalin conceded the daily radiation treatments were ``not a
good procedure. It just didn't match his personality. It was too
slow a process for him.''
   Kornblith implanted radioactive isotopes directly into the
tumor. For five days the isotopes bombarded the cancerous tissue
with radiation.
   Atwater could receive visitors but they had to stand behind a
lead shield.
   After the isotopes were removed, Kornblith followed up with
chemotherapy designed to kill any tumor cells on the periphery of
the growth. Atwater will receive additional doses every six weeks.
   If the combination of treatments succeeds in killing the tumor _
described as olive-size _ it will stop growing. ``Either it shrinks
or stays the same,'' said Kornblith.
   In that case, he said it was unlikely surgery would be needed to
remove the dead tissue.
   ``Unless it causes lots of swelling in the brain, which so far
it hasn't, we'd just leave it alone and eventually the body would
absorb it,'' said the doctor.

   The political paralysis in Israel and the
muscle-flexing of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein are the latest
examples of how limited U.S. influence really is in the Middle East.
   Despite an annual U.S. aid outlay of $3 billion, the Bush
administration cannot steer Israelis into choosing a government
responsive to the U.S. land-for-peace formula.
   And despite the purchase of about $2 billion a year in Iraqi oil
and support for bank loans for Baghdad, the administration cannot
deter Saddam Hussein from stockpiling dangerous weapons and
threatening to wipe out half of Israel with poison gas if it
attacks.
   Israel's political problems evidently are impervious to outside
pressure, while Iraq's drive for prominence in the Arab world is
not going to slow down just to please the United States.
   The upshot is no negotiations for the indefinite future between
Israel and Palestinian Arabs, and frayed nerves as the militant
Iraqi leader bids for leadership in the Arab world _ and gains
support from such reputed moderates as King Hussein of Jordan and
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
   ``Iraq is not a country which wants or calls for war,'' Mubarak
said after showing support for Saddam Hussein last weekend with a
visit to Iraq. The Jordanian king registered similar sentiments in
Aqaba.
   Free in offering political advice to the Soviet Union, to Latin
America and to South Africa, among others, the State Department is
holding its tongue about the situation in Israel.
   Clearly, Shimon Peres, the leader of the Labor Party, is far
more likely than Yitzhak Shamir of Likud to go along with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and hold talks with Palestinians in
Cairo.
   But the State Department kept quiet after the defection of two
religious members of Parliament on Wednesday stopped Peres from
putting together a coalition government.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher was instructed to say nothing even
about suggestions that Israel reform its political procedures to
prevent minority blocs from controlling the balance of power.
   ``It's a matter for them to decide,'' Boucher said.
   On Iraq, the State Department is a little more voluble, but
again without any apparent effect.
   The department called Thursday for a halt to the development and
production of biological weapons amid reports Iraq is acquiring the
capability to wage ``this particularly horrible form of warfare.''
   But Boucher would not confirm reports that Iraq is in fact
building a stockpile of biological weapons. He said that would
involve disclosing the extent of U.S. intelligence efforts.
   ``In general, the United States is very concerned about the
spread of this particularly horrible form of warfare in the
world,'' Boucher said. ``We do believe some nations are at work on
a biological weapons capability.''
   The political deadlock in Israel and the growing military might
of Iraq are beyond the range of U.S. influence largely because they
are based on strong domestic and political considerations.
   Roughly half of the Israeli parliament, reflecting anxieties of
a large percentage of the populace, is unwilling to set up a
government that would surrender control of the West Bank and Gaza
to Palestinian Arabs.
   So Peres, who would give up the land, is unable to muster a
majority to form a government. And the Bush administration is
powerless to help him. In fact, any signal that the State
Department prefers him to Shamir could boomerang. Israel, like most
small countries, does not respond happily to big-power pressure.
   Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, is driven partly by hostility to
Israel and to Iran. He has not accepted the idea of a Jewish state
in the Middle East, at least one that controls the West Bank and
Gaza, and he has felt the sting of Israel, which destroyed Iraq's
nuclear reactor outside Baghdad in 1981.
   For eight years, Iraq fought a bloody war with the
fundamentalist Shiite regime in Iran, losing an estimated 300,000
to 400,000 men until the United Nations arranged a cease-fire.
   American warships guided Iraqi oil through the Persian Gulf
during the war, but that tilt was a minor event in Baghdad's view
of the world.

<HEAD>Projected Cost of Weapons Systems Rises $31 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department estimates that the
price tag for bringing 95 major weapons programs from design to
full production is $843.8 billion _ $31 billion more than
projections made three months earlier.
   In issuing its report Thursday, the Pentagon blamed the
significant jump in the last quarter of 1989 on revised inflation
rates and a slight increase in the number of missiles, aircraft and
other weapons President Bush sought.
   Among the major increases were the estimated costs for the
land-based Midgetman nuclear missile, the C-17 cargo plane and the
DDG-51 destroyer. The Pentagon is reconsidering the latter two
programs.
   The so-called Selected Acquisition Report provides a
``snapshot'' as of last Dec. 31 of expected overall costs for 95
major weapons systems if Bush's defense budget is enacted as
proposed.
   However, the overall estimate may change because Congress or
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may limit production on or terminate
some weapons systems, including several under review.
   The previous report, released in September, predicted the
overall cost of the major systems would be $806.6 billion.
   The difference in the two figures is $37.2 billion, which
includes the $31 billion increase and an estimate of $6.2 billion
for the Navy's ``Fixed Distributed System,'' a classified ocean
surveillance project.
   Among the estimated increases was the cost of the Midgetman
missile, which rose $1.9 billion or 35 percent to $7.3 billion.
   The Pentagon said the jump was primarily the result of restoring
costs expected all along but excluded last year because of the way
Bush and Congress handled the missile program in the current
defense budget.
   The fiscal 1990 budget contains less than $250 million for the
mobile, single-warhead missile. With those funds, the Midgetman
program amounted to a research and development project, the
Pentagon said.
   ``This is a reinstatement of the costs,'' said Roy Lietza, a
spokesman for the Air Force.
   Among the increased costs for the Midgetman are $1.3 billion for
the missile and its basing with a goal of initial operation in
1997; $458 million for six additional research and development
missiles; and $87 million for inflation.
   The estimated cost of the multiple-warhead MX nuclear missile
dropped $3.9 billion from $23 billion, primarily because of a
reduction in the number of planned missiles from 255 to 193. The
drop was partially offset by revised inflation rates with an
estimated increase of $236 million.
   The estimates consist of the annual costs of research and
development, purchase of the weapon itself and associated
construction, added together for the several years each weapon will
be bought, sometimes extending into the next century. Cost of
operations, such as fuel and crew wages, are not included.
   The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer _ or DDG-51 _ increased $4
billion from a previous estimate of $2.8 billion. The Navy cited an
increase in the number of ships from 33 to 38 and revised inflation
rates as the reasons for the 15 percent jump.
   The other Navy program the defense secretary may curtail _ the
SSN-21 Seawolf attack submarine _ dropped in estimated cost from
$20 billion to $16 billion because of a decrease in the number of
submarines from 12 to nine.
   The estimated cost of the C-17 cargo plane increased $4.4
billion from a previous price of $37.4 billion. The Air Force
blamed the rise on inflation and schedule changes due to plans to
stretch out the program.
   Slower production rates frequently raise total costs by reducing
production efficiency.
   One of the largest increases in Army programs was in the medium
tactical vehicles in which the estimated cost jumped from $8.6
billion to $16.1 billion, or 88 percent.
   The Army attributed the rise to an increase in the number of
trucks from 79,157 to 102,322, an extension of the modernization
program from 15 to 30 years, schedule changes and inflation.
   The estimated cost of the M-1 tank program, which Cheney has
proposed canceling in the budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1, dropped $6 billion due to a decrease in the number of tanks.

<HEAD>Iowa Wants FmHA to Accept its `Moral Responsibility' in Grain
Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iowa environmental official says he's
waiting for a federal agency to ``accept its moral responsibility''
for selling off 12,755 bushels of corn it knew was contaminated
with a deadly toxin.
   The mound of grain is believed to have the highest concentration
of cancer-causing aflatoxin ever found in this country, as much as
1,600 times the maximum allowable limit for human consumption,
state and federal officials say.
   An order Thursday from the Iowa Division of Environmental
Protection gave the Farmers Home Administration and the Pruess
Elevator Co. of Lowden until April 20 to remove the corn, and held
them equally liable.
   But a lawyer representing the FmHA, which sold the grain from a
foreclosed farm at Chouteau, Okla. and knew it was tainted,
insisted the agency has no responsibility. The owner of the
elevator, Harlan Pruess, who bought the corn, declined comment.
   The corn has been placed under quarantine in a sparsely settled
area three miles from Lowden in eastern Iowa.
   ``Whatever is going to be done is not going to be cheap,'' said
Allan Stokes, director of the state environmental agency. ``We're
waiting to see if they (the FmHA) will accept their moral
responsibility.''
   Stokes estimated the cleanup cost at around $100,000, while
Iowa's secretary of agriculture, Dale Cochran, has placed it as
high as $1.5 million. The FmHA sold the corn for $9,566.
   If the deadline is not met, the state could clean up the grain
and then sue the FmHA and the elevator, Stokes said.
   Aflatoxins are chemical substances produced by certain soil
fungi. The Food and Drug Administration says aflatoxin
concentrations above 20 parts per billion are unsuitable for human
consumption and concentrations above 300 parts per billion are
unsuitable for animal feed.
   FDA tests of the corn found concentrations as high as 32,300
parts per billion in one sample. In its bill of sale, the FmHA
disclosed that the corn contained aflatoxin concentrations greater
than 5,000 parts per billion and assigned any liability to the
purchaser.
   Robert Bird, a U.S. Department of Agriculture attorney
representing the FmHA, said ``I don't see how the state of Iowa
could hold the FmHA co-responsible because the FmHA has no
ownership interest.''
   The FDA and the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture both knew in
advance of the intended sale and if either ``told the FmHA to
destroy the corn, the FmHA would do it,'' Bird said.
   Gary Dean, director of compliance at the FDA's regional office
at Kansas City, said the correspondence between the FDA and
Oklahoma Department of Agriculture advised the FmHA of the
guidelines. He said the FDA could not become involved until there
was an interstate shipment.
   Under federal law, contaminated grain cannot be moved from one
state to another.
   Oklahoma officials notified counterparts in Iowa once tests
disclosed the aflatoxin concentrations in the early March shipment
from the foreclosed farm, and Iowa inspectors were on hand to
quarantine the corn as it arrived.
   Their action prevented the grain from being fed to animals or
winding up in milk or meat products. But inhaling dust from the
corn could prove a health risk, and state officials are in no rush
to disturb the pile until they have an acceptable cleanup plan.
   Aflatoxin is produced by two soil fungi, Aspergillus flavus and
A. parasiticus. State officials said they believe the toxin
flourished because the corn was unusually moist when harvested and
became heated as it dried.

<HEAD>Analysts See Good and Bad in Borrowing Plans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government plans to borrow $45.3 billion this
quarter could unsettle debt markets, but they are a welcome sign
the Bush administration plans to speed up its savings and loan
bailout, analysts say.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board, the Treasury
Department-led panel that controls the policy and purse strings of
the program, announced bailout borrowing plans for the April-June
quarter on Thursday.
   The amount authorized is more than four times larger than the
$11 billion authorized in the January-March period.
   ``These are enormous numbers, but I think it's a very good
sign,'' said Bert Ely, an S&amp;L analyst in Alexandria, Va. ``For the
first time ... the government is finally putting realistic amounts
of money on the table to get this cleanup process moving.''
   The administration will raise the money by auctioning short-term
Treasury bills or notes. It's to be repaid when the government
sells the real estate and other assets owned by failed S&amp;Ls.
   Economists caution that government debt buyers may have a hard
time absorbing the heavy borrowing and that short-term interest
rates may rise slightly as a result.
   But, they said, the plans come at a good time. Usually,
government borrowing needs are lighter in the quarter because of
income tax collections.
   ``Treasury traditionally allows its (cash balance) to rise
rapidly between April and June. What it will do this time is not
allow that balance to rise as much,'' said economist Samuel D.
Kahan of Fuji Securities Inc.
   The administration has been under pressure from Congress and
private critics to speed up the closing and sale of insolvent
thrift associations, which are losing $29 million a day.
   Regulators have disposed of only 52 thrifts out of the slightly
more than 400 S&amp;Ls seized since early last year. However, they've
announced plans to sell or close 141 by the end of June. Currently
they are marketing 87 to 1,000 prospective buyers.
   In order to attract buyers, the Resolution Trust Corp. recently
relaxed its standards to give S&amp;L purchasers as long as 18 months
to return bad assets such as sour loans to the government. The
previous deadline of six months was thought to discourage many
potential buyers.
   But, as a result of the new policy, the government will be
holding more S&amp;L assets after it sells institutions.
   Ely estimated that the S&amp;L buyers will get about $1 in assets
and $2 in government cash for every $3 in deposits they agree to
take.
   ``My hope is they'll keep it rolling,'' Ely said.
   ``The question is, `Why now?''' he said. ``I think the Bush
administration is really starting to worry ... the whole S&amp;L mess
will quickly turn into a political disaster.''

   Justice was delayed but not denied for
John E. List, a prosecutor said after jurors returned the stiffest
verdict they could against the former Sunday school teacher
convicted of killing his family in 1971.
   A Superior Court jury Thursday found List guilty of five counts
of first-degree murder in the deaths of his wife, three children
and mother.
   List had claimed he killed them in part because he feared for
their souls. But the jury rejected List's defense that he was
innocent because of his mental condition.
   The jury also turned down defense attorney Elijah L. Miller
Jr.'s argument that List lacked the ability to deliberate over his
actions. If List had not acted deliberately, the panel would have
had to return a second-degree verdict.
   As he had through most of the trial, List showed no reaction
when the verdict was announced.
   List, 64, faces a mandatory life term in prison at sentencing
May 1 by Judge William L'E. Wertheimer.
   Helen List, 46, the couple's three children _ Patricia, 16;
John, 15; and Frederick, 13 _ and List's mother, Alma List, 84,
were shot to death on Nov. 9, 1971, in their 18-room mansion in
suburban Westfield, 25 miles from New York.
   In a filing cabinet, List left a chilling five-page letter
explaining his actions and motives to his pastor. ``P.S.: Mother is
in the hallway in the attic _ 3rd floor. She was too heavy to
move,'' he wrote.
   List had disappeared before authorities found the victims'
bodies on Dec. 7, 1971. He spent most of his 18 years on the run in
Denver, where he took up his old profession of accounting, rejoined
the Lutheran church and remarried.
   He was arrested in Richmond, Va., last June after a tip was
called in to the television show ``America's Most Wanted,'' which
had broadcast the story.
   ``Even though (justice) may be delayed, it's not going to be
denied, and that gives us a great feeling in our system,'' said
Edmund Tucker, acting Union County prosecutor.
   Miller left the courthouse without commenting.
   Juror Joseph Hobbs, 51, said List's note to his pastor and other
notes to his in-laws, calmly explaining his actions and
motivations, were decisive in reaching the verdict.
   The letter to his pastor showed List acted deliberately, Hobbs
said, because List said his original plans were to kill them on
Nov. 1, All Saints Day, but his travel plans were delayed.

<HEAD>Keating Says He's Victim of Government-Industry Vendetta</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles H. Keating is depicting himself as a
victim of a vendetta by traditional savings and loan operators and
regulators who wanted government controls clamped back on the
thrift industry.
   Keating testified Thursday that his use of Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association to finance his multibillion-dollar hotel, real
estate, stock and junk bond empire incurred the wrath of then-top
S&amp;L regulator Edwin Gray and the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the industry's biggest trade group.
   Ultimately, Keating told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, it
was the son of the league's president _ a top official for the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board _ who built the case for the federal
takeover of Lincoln a year ago.
   Regulators claim that, through fraud and racketeering, Keating
and his associates looted Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln of federally
insured deposits that ultimately will cost taxpayers up to $2
billion to repay.
   Keating cited documents, news articles and letters that quoted
Gray, the bank board's former chairman, and then-league President
William B. O'Connell as criticizing him harshly years before.
   ``It became a personal vendetta in my opinion,'' Keating said,
testifying for a sixth day on his suit challenging the seizure of
Lincoln.
   Keating said Gray and O'Connell used him as a ``stalking horse''
to justify the reregulation of the S&amp;L industry by the bank board
in 1985 after its deregulation by Congress two years earlier.
   ``I had a high visibility because I had taken a staid S&amp;L,
namely Lincoln, and proceeded to invest in opportunities that were
not compatible ... with the historic role of home financing but ...
in conformance with California and federal law ... were compatible
with the regulations,'' he testified.
   Sporkin, who has presided over 23 days of hearings on Keating's
suit, asked if William O'Connell was related to Kevin O'Connell,
who as the official assigned by the bank board in 1988 to supervise
the regulation of Lincoln, is the government's chief witness.
   ``We found out in 1988 that this O'Connell is that O'Connell's
son,'' Keating responded, nodding in the direction of Kevin
O'Connell, who has sat government attorneys through much of the
hearing.
   Keating said his aides on several occasions asked Kevin
O'Connell's supervisors to remove him from Lincoln's case but were
told that the bank board had no one else who could handle it. He
said the requests were made before he knew the two O'Connells were
related.
   Keating pointed to a bank board memo dated April 7, 1989 _ seven
days before the government seized control of Lincoln _ from Kevin
O'Connell to Alvin Smuzynski, deputy director of the bank board's
office of regulatory activities.
   ``Even our lawyers are finally getting the message,'' O'Connell
said in the memo. ``Under every document is another scam, and they
seem to finally understand what type of thieves we are dealing with
and why we need to get them out.''
   In an accompanying memo, O'Connell said that just one day
earlier _ April 6 _ $40 million was removed from Lincoln
subsidiaries despite a December 1988 directive from regulators not
to engage in transactions above $10 million without notifying them.
   Asked by reporters about the memo during a break in the hearing,
O'Connell said they ``are self-explanatory.''
   Keating defended the April 6 transaction, saying the money was
non-insured deposits that he ordered transferred to Bankers Trust,
a major money center bank in New York.
   ``There's no difference for those assets except now they are
deposited in Bankers Trust instead of Lincoln,'' he said. ``We were
concerned they wanted to take over Lincoln. We moved (the deposits)
to another institution where it wouldn't be so easy for them
(regulators) to freeze them.''
   Government attorney James Murphy objected several times to
Keating's testimony as irrelevant to the grounds for the takeover _
that Lincoln was being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner in
violation of the law.
   ``I want to give Mr. Keating a chance to present his position,''
Sporkin said, overruling the objections. ``It's his lawsuit that
the purported reasons are masking the real reasons, which was a
vendetta of some kind.''

<TEXT>
   Large crowds visiting a museum being
prosecuted for showing sexually graphic photographs reveal that for
many residents, this city's clean-cut, conservative reputation is
an unwanted burden.
   City police last week charged the Contemporary Arts Center and
its director with pandering obscenity and other charges when the
museum opened an exhibit by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   The charges seemed characteristic of a city that gained its prim
reputation by closing all of its adult bookstores, banning the sale
or lease of X-rated videos, and starting one of the first citizens'
anti-pornography groups. The city is also a center for the
right-to-life movement.
   ``Cincinnati is a conservative town. We don't have a district
with a lot of streetwalkers and nude shows ... and I don't think
it's the appropriate thing,'' said Fred Lohman, a retired
controller for a tailoring company. ``I'm not for censorship, but I
am for morality.''
   But while anti-pornography advocates have attended rallies
against the exhibit, open pending a court ruling, more than 14,000
people have lined up to see the 175-photograph exhibit since it
opened last Friday. The museum's list of dues-paying patrons has
increased from 1,600 to 2,300 in two weeks.
   ``I think the people in Cincinnati are like people in any
city,'' said Todd Kamm, a social worker and artist. ``It's just
that the people in power in the county ... are pretty archaic.''
   A researcher who surveyed local attitudes in 1988 says
anti-abortion and anti-pornography groups are led by talented
conservative leaders who happen to live in the city.
   ``Cincinnati is no more conservative than the rest of the
nation,'' says Al Tuchfarber, director of the University of
Cincinnati's Institute for Policy Research.
   Tuchfarber says anti-pornography groups draw much of their
strength from the traditionally working-class, Roman Catholic west
side of the city, which he said is slightly more conservative than
the east side.
   The city of 370,000 is home to Dr. John Willke, president of
National Right to Life, and the Rev. Jerry Kirk, founder of the
National Coalition Against Pornography. Phoenix financier Charles
H. Keating Jr. grew up in Cincinnati and founded the
anti-pornography group Citizens for Decency Through Law.
   In 1977, a Cincinnati jury convicted Hustler magazine Publisher
Larry Flynt of pandering obscenity. A state appeals court in 1979
ordered a new trial, but charges were dropped in 1985.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibit appeared in Philadelphia; Washington,
D.C.; Chicago; Hartford, Conn., and Berkeley, Calif., without
attracting criminal charges.
   But police and a grand jury raided the Arts Center the day after
the show opened here and charged the center and its director,
Dennis Barrie, with pandering obscenity and using children in
nudity-related material, both misdemeanors.
   A federal judge has barred local authorities from taking further
action until the arraignment Monday in Hamilton County Municipal
Court.
   Two pictures in the exhibit feature nude children and five
depict sex acts. If convicted, Barrie and the museum each would
face fines of $6,000 and Barrie six months in jail.
   The city's last public debate over art came after the 1988
announcement of plans to erect sculptures of winged pigs to
commemorate the Cincinnati's history as a hog-butchering center.
The pigs eventually were unveiled in a city park, although many
argued they were ridiculous.
   Arts Center visitor Michael Moore said the city is doing itself
more harm than good by casting itself as a defender of outdated
standards.
   ``They're pushing for corporations to locate here,'' Moore said.
``I think if I'm the head of a corporation in New York or San
Francisco, I could imagine my employees saying, `Why do I want to
go to Cincinnati?'''
   The Chamber of Commerce has spent $6 million since 1984 on its
``Blue Chip Campaign'' to promote the city's cultural attractions,
and to cite economic reasons for companies to move to Cincinnati.
   The city, however, won't attract the New York City-based College
Art Association national convention in 1995. The group told city
officials it has dropped Cincinnati from consideration because of
the Mapplethorpe dispute.
   Jane Dieckmann, a homemaker who is particularly outraged at the
exhibit's photograph of a seminude girl, said prosecutors shouldn't
worry about criticism in pressing charges against the museum.
   ``I don't care what other cities think,'' Mrs. Dieckmann said.
``I've seen what other cities are like, and I don't think they have
anything more than we have.''

   The tanning machine in a school
superintendent's office struck a slightly too sunny note for
cash-strapped town officials.
   So Superintendent Concetta Verge agreed to remove it.``It's
gone,'' she said Wednesday. ``It's been removed. This is silly.''
   Joseph Bilotta, chairman of the town's Board of Selectmen, said
people ``weren't too happy'' about the machine, although Mrs. Verge
bought it with her own money.
   ``Things are tight and people take offense,'' he said.
   Mrs. Verge's husband wouldn't let her use the machine _ a chair
equipped with a tanning lamp for the face _ at home because he
considered it a health risk.
   She said she had been keeping the equipment temporarily in the
school offices and had planned to move it to a relative's home.

   Dale Holand has to stay healthy about
three more weeks to graduate from high school with a perfect
attendance record in 12 years of school.
   He's trying to best the records of his older brother and sister,
both of whom missed one day each in their school careers.
   ``My brother missed a day in kindergarten for some reason,''
said the 18-year-old Holand. ``My sister is still mad at my mom for
making her go to the hospital and miss one day. I'll beat them
both.''
   Holand's classmates are a bit baffled by his perfect record.
   ``You'd think he was sick, just one day,'' said classmate Dennis
Flaten.
   Holand says sickness usually befalls him at the holidays.
   ``Mostly around Christmas,'' he says. ``I could have skipped if
I'd wanted, but I didn't think it was worth it. It would have
disappointed my parents.''
   Holand's father, Richard Holand, is the elementary school
principal in Park River.
   ``How could I skip? My dad was in charge,'' the younger Holand
said.
   Post-graduation plans aren't firm, Holand said. He's considering
going to college somewhere in the state but he might go into the
military.
   ``I might not do anything, for a while. All those days of school
without missing, I'll have some catching up to do,'' Holand said.

<HEAD>FBI, Residents Keep Lid on Steel Drums Packed With Cash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating residents
of this coastal community after several unearthed millions of
dollars believed hidden by drug traffickers and went on a buying
binge, the U.S. attorney says.
   U.S. attorney Daniel Lopez Romo said late Thursday that the
money was believed inside drums dug up two weeks ago in a farmer's
field in Vega Baja, 35 miles northwest of San Juan.
   Lopez said officials became suspicious after residents began
buying luxury items with ``great sums'' of cash.
   Authorities found one drum with $1.5 million still inside but
others had been emptied, he said. Newspapers said between 10 and 11
empty drums were found nearby.
   ``So you can speculate that we're talking about extraordinary
amounts of money,'' Lopez said.
   ``The FBI is interviewing a number of people to find out where
the money came from and what legal action to take,'' he said. ``But
we can't make anything public about the investigation.''
   Newspapers reported residents were snapping up new houses,
boats, cars and VCRs with the cash. They said federal authorities
descended on the town after a car mechanic paid $170,000 cash for a
house and a sports car, and deposited $50,000 cash in a bank.
   Lopez said the FBI interviewed several people and many local
residents were returning goods bought with the found cash.
   Many also weren't, he said.
   El Vocero, the tabloid that broke the story, said the FBI had
confiscated ``millions'' _ mostly in $100 and $20 bills _ from
residents and from the drum recovered by agents.
   Vega Baja, a bustling community of 30,000 nestled between a
pristine beach overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and tropical hills,
was quiet Thursday and few residents would talk about the money.
Most said they didn't know anything about it.
   City Hall was closed and many shops shuttered their doors early
in preparation for Good Friday. Parents took children to the beach
and fishermen climbed atop coral hills to cast for red snapper.
   ``If I found that money, I wouldn't have touched it for anything
in the world. It's dirty money _ that's for sure. Something real
fishy about it,'' said one woman who ran an outdoor cafe and gave
her name only as Carmen.
   There was some confusion as to where the money had actually been
buried. Many said the beach. Others said a field.
   Lopez said the location of the buried treasure couldn't be
revealed because ``there would be a gold rush to the site.''
   ``We can't give that information. We shouldn't and we won't,''
he said.
   The U.S. attorney said it was a good bet the cash was drug
trafficking money.
   ``That's one of the strongest possibilities, but I can't say
with certainty,'' he said. ``It's probable that somebody knew where
it was buried and blew the whistle.''
   El Vocero quoted unidentified sources as saying the Puerto Rico
Justice Department had estimated up to $20 million may have been
buried.
   Miguel Rodriguez, a police narcotics agent in Vega Baja, said
Thursday a car and a motorcycle had been turned in to FBI agents
investigating the case.
   ``This is so confidential the FBI is not even telling us
anything,'' Rodriguez said. ``There is a report of lots of money
floating around, but we don't know from where.''
   The FBI office in the capital of San Juan has refused to discuss
the case until the investigation is completed. Because the
Caribbean island of Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth, its
investigatory matters come under federal jurisdiction.
   Under Puerto Rican law, anyone who finds treasure on private
property is entitled to half, with the remainder going to the
commonwealth.
   But the FBI could invoke a federal law entitling the U.S.
government to confiscate funds tied to the illegal drug trade to
pay for the costs of the investigation.

<TEXT>
   Harvard University President Derek Bok
struck back at conservative critics of higher education, saying
problems stem from a decade of tax cuts and federal deficits rather
than ``liberal'' education practices.
   In his 19th annual report, issued Thursday, Bok warned that the
criticism could end up hurting higher education.
   Conservatives who rose to prominence in the political climate of
the 1980s ``saw universities as liberal strongholds populated by
cocksure, opinionated professors,'' Bok wrote in the 40-page report.
   These conservative critics have attacked higher education ``more
savagely during the past 10 years than at any time in my memory,''
Bok said.
   ``Most of the charges are flawed because they ignore basic
conflicts and contradictions in the demands society makes on
universities,'' he wrote.
   ``Continued criticism of this kind ... threatens to do needless
damage to the public confidence so important to maintaining a
strong system of colleges and universities.''
   ``What is needed ... is not an end to criticism but a criticism
that is less given to rhetorical excess, more careful with its
criteria for judgment,'' Bok wrote.
   Bok addressed several areas of controversy, including the
conflict between teaching and research. Last month, the faculty of
Harvard Medical School approved a set of guidelines governing
outside work for faculty members.
   ``One signal comes from all the critics who deplore the neglect
of teaching and the stress that universities place on published
work,'' Bok said. ``The other makes the opposite point through a
system of powerful incentives and rewards that offers fame, fortune
and ample funding to successful scientists and scholars.''
   Bok said teachers are not always motivated by private gain when
undertaking outside pursuits and said that research usually
benefits a university. But Bok did say schools need to delineate
how much time can be spent on outside pursuits. He said
restrictions are inadequate at many institutions.
   Bok also decried what he called ``hostile publicity'' about
rising tuition costs. Bok said most news reports about expensive
tuition are focused on a few high-powered universities such as
Harvard, Stanford, Yale or Princeton when in fact most
undergraduates attend public universities where tuition is less
than $2,000 per year.

   The mayors of Oakland and San Francisco
heaped scorn on the Federal Emergency Management Agency over its
handling of housing relief for people left homeless after the
October earthquake.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos accused the agency of behaving as
if it were ``protecting the public treasury against the victims of
the disaster'' in testifying Thursday before the House Subcommittee
on Housing and Community Development.
   The 7.1-magnitude quake that struck Northern California on Oct.
17 killed 67 people and did millions of dollars in property damage.
   
   Agnos and Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson complained that the agency
displayed ``arrogance and a lack of compassion'' toward people
stunned and suddenly homeless.
   Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata said, ``I'm here to
communicate a lot of anger, a lot of frustration Oakland has over
the way FEMA has treated us ... if these people worked for me in
Alameda County they would be summarily dismissed,''
   ``There may be difficulties within a bureaucracy, but there
should be no excuse for treating people you are empowered to serve
with disrespect, callousness and as though they were the enemy
seeking to come into your home in the dark of night to steal your
silverware,'' Perata said.
   One FEMA rule required that applicants had to have lived in a
building at least 30 days to qualify for assistance, Wilson said.
Those who live in a place for short periods, then move on, were the
hardest hit, he said.
   ``Only when FEMA was challenged by a lawsuit did FEMA agree to
meet the needs of such persons, an agreement which was not
implemented in good faith,'' said Wilson, pointing to a letter
containing an official objection.
   Agnos suggested that house equity should be available as
collateral for loans to repair damaged houses, not just cash. This
would help retired people who own or have large equity in their
homes, but who haven't got immediate cash resources to get the job
done, he said.
   Agnos also recommended that $44 million from the president's
discretionary fund be allocated to help rebuild affordable housing,
another 2,200 rental assistance vouchers be provide until units are
rebuilt, and an extension of FEMA assistance.
   Lorri Jean, FEMA deputy regional director, said the agency had
been heavily burdened with Hurricane Hugo relief when the
earthquake hit. Many agency members in her region already were
committed to the Hugo program, she said.
   ``It was necessary for FEMA to initiate a concentrated hiring
and training program in order to meet the shortages of personnel,''
she said.
   The elected officials generally praised the actions of the
federal Housing and Urban Development agency, Red Cross volunteers,
and the state Department of Housing and Community Development for
their response to the disaster.
   According to reports made to the Association of Bay Area
Governments, Santa Cruz County lost between 4,000 and 5,000
dwellings, some 3,400 homes were lost or damaged in Alameda County,
and more than 5,000 units were damaged or destroyed in San
Francisco City and County.
   Local officials have said the need $3 billion in state and
federal aid to recover from the earthquake. Figures on how much
FEMA has spent weren't available.

<HEAD>North Korea Said to Have Nuclear Facilities, Without Using Them _
Yet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States believes North Korea has the
facilities to build nuclear weapons but is not moving rapidly on
the work, says a senior Pentagon official.
   U.S. officials have evidence the North Koreans have built a
reactor as well as a reprocessing facility to separate plutonium,
the material used to make nuclear weapons, Henry S. Rowen,
assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs,
said Thursday.
   ``I would not want to characterize it as a slow pace but a
deliberate pace,'' Rowen told reporters at a news briefing in which
he assessed North Korea's work on manufacturing nuclear weapons.
``However, it's not galloping ahead at a great rate. ... It's a
concern to us and the Japanese.''
   The Pentagon official said the United States raised the issue of
North Korea's building nuclear weapons in talks in Washington last
weekend between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``We hope that their influence would be enough to get it under
control, get at least inspectors in there, preferably to end the
whole thing, end the separation business,'' Rowen said. ``So far,
it hasn't borne fruit.''
   The United States hopes the Soviet Union would have some
influence with the communist regime in North Korea.
   U.S. officials have expressed concerns about the potential
proliferation of nuclear weapons. CIA Director William Webster said
in congressional testimony last year that 15 or more nations,
including many from the developing world, could possess nuclear
weapons early in the next century.
   Webster also has said that many developing countries are working
on ballistic missiles, which could be used to carry nuclear or
other weapons to their targets.
   Five nations have said they have nuclear weapons: the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, Great Britain and France. India
exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a
non-military explosion.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is investigating charges
that immigration guards beat and sexually harassed inmates at a
detention camp for aliens seeking political asylum.
   Mike Lempres, who oversees the Immigration and Naturalization
Service detention centers, flew to Miami on Thursday to check into
the charges, which have been turned over to Justice's civil rights
division.
   ``Should any of these allegations lead to a finding that there
are abuses, the abuses will not be tolerated,'' Lempres said after
touring the Krome Avenue camp.
   Krome is the only center in Florida that holds illegal aliens
while immigration considers their claims for asylum. Most are
Cubans, Haitians and Central Americans who claim political
persecution in their homelands.
   Lempres said he suspects the abuse allegations stem from ``a few
bad apples.''
   ``The conditions I see there are not inhumane,'' he said.
   Refugee advocates spoke of sexual harassment and beatings that
have prompted some refugees to give up their appeals and accept
deportation.
   ``Things there are so unbelievably bad,'' said Cheryl Little, an
attorney for Haitian Refugee Center Inc. ``Acts of serious abuse
abound.''
   Ms. Little said she has more than 100 affidavits from detainees
and said she has been seeking a thorough government investigation
for more than a year.
   ``I left home trying to escape the violence of Haiti,'' said
Lavidieu Conserve, a former Krome detainee. ``And I come here and
am badly beaten.''
   Another Haitian immigrant, Chantale Pierre, said camp guards
repeatedly fondled her and propositioned her.
   The women sometimes give in to guards' sexual advances because
they are promised they will be released, those gathered Thursday at
the Haitian Refugee Center said.
   Women are subjected to repeated searches and are ``manhandled
during these searches,'' Ms. Little said. People are threatened
with deportation if they complain, she said.
   ``I have had countless clients tell me they can no longer take
the conditions at Krome. They made the decision to return to Haiti
... living in hiding there,'' said attorney Esther Cruz.
   Lempres, asked about this charge, responded: ``I can tell you we
don't discourage these people from filing the asylum applications.''
   Immigration officials said detainees usually spend only 41 days
at Krome, but that if they fight deportation, they can remain as
long as a year.
   The camp, a former Nike missile base on the edge of the
Everglades, has been used since 1980 to hold undocumented aliens.
The compound of one-story, non-descript dormitories held 444
detainees Thursday.
   Ms. Little said an earlier federal probe was flawed because the
detainees weren't safeguarded against retaliation.
   Ignacio Lopez, 27, from Guatemala, said each guard is like a
dictator with his own rules. While food is plentiful at the camp,
he said, guards sometimes force them to rush their meals, throwing
away their food after a few minutes.
   Former detainee Sony Dujon compared camp guards to TonTons
Macoute, the feared secret militia of Haiti's deposed Duvalier
regime.
   The Rev. Thomas Wenski called for an end to the practice of
detaining aliens at Krome while their appeals are heard. He said
there are willing sponsors to take responsibility for them, and
they pose no threat to the community.
   ``There is humiliation and indignity,'' said the Roman Catholic
priest, who ministers in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood. ``The
worst problem is the people are innocent. They came here only to
seek freedom.''

   Chinese leaders are warning of domestic religious
and ethnic conflict, apparently fearing the nationalist tumult in
neighboring Central Asia could spread to Mongols, Manchus, Moslems
and Tibetans in China.
   A spread of ethnic violence and religious fundamentalism from
Soviet Asia, and democratic impulses from Mongolia, could threaten
Beijing's long-nurtured concept of unity and harmony between Han
Chinese and the nation's 55 minorities.
   Martial law has been in effect in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa
for more than a year, following recurrent anti-Chinese riots.
   Last week, troops were reportedly dispatched to three cities
near the Soviet border to put down unrest among Moslem ethnic
groups. The government has barred foreign travelers and journalists
from the region.
   Premier Li Peng in February said ``a tiny number of separatists,
under the mantle of nationalism and religion, oppose socialism and
sabotage the unity of all Chinese nationalities.''
   China, he told officials in charge of minority affaris, ``should
wipe out all separatist activities while they are still in the
embryonic stage.''
   Beijing's minority problem pales before that of the Soviet
Union, where almost 50 percent of the population is non-Russian. In
China, the 86 million members of non-Han ethnic groups are less
than 8 percent of the 1.1 billion population, and many have long
been assimilated into Chinese culture.
   But ethnic groups inhabit lands comprising 60 percent of China's
territory, stretching from the Himalayas of the southwest to the
Silk Road deserts of the west and the endless steppes of the north.
   Tibet has been the most volatile region. Many Tibetans
stubbornly resist China's claims to sovereignty, and dozens have
died in anti-Chinese riots in Lhasa since late 1987.
   At least 4,000 Tibetans demonstratd in Lhasa last month to mark
the anniversary of martial law, according to spokesmen for Tibet's
exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, but China denied the
report. Beijing refused entry to all foreign journalists and
tourists, and operators didn't put phone calls through.
   The Buddhist Tibetans deeply resent China's past policies of
religious and cultural persecution. Their feelings are shared by
the Uygurs and other Moslem groups, more than half the 14 million
people of arid Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to the north.
   Xinjiang borders on Soviet Kazakhstan, Kirghizia and
Tadzhikistan and shares cultural ties with their restless peoples.
In addition to 7.3 million Huis and 6 million Uygurs, scatterings
of Kazaks, Kirghiz, Tatars, Russians and Tajiks are also found in
Xinjiang and other border provinces.
   Asian diplomats in Beijing said a dispute over a mosque in
Xinjiang's remote western desert town of Kashgar sparked last
week's unrest in which up to 50 were killed, according to
unconfirmed reports. They said the rioters were from the Kirghiz
ethnic group.
   The disturbances were the worst since May, when about 150
Moslems were arrested for attacking the Communist Party
headquarters in Urumqi. They were upset over a Chinese-language
book they said blasphemed their religion.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua on Thursday denied any
knowledge of the reported clashes in Kashgar. Chinese officials
have sought to keep news of the unrest from spreading by barring
foreigners from the region and refusing to answer queries from
foreign journalists and diplomats.
   But Chinese officials have frequently warned of potential
trouble in the area.
   The regional Communist Party chief, Song Hanliang, said after a
tour of Kashgar and other areas of southern Xinjiang in February
that ``every place and work unit now has hot spots.''
   He called for greater control over religious activities, saying
the government must not allow religion to be used to promote
separatist tendencies.
   Xinjiang's government chief, Tomur Dawamat, also warned last
month of ``social scum'' aided by foreigners who sought to ``oppose
Xinjiang remaining in the big family of the motherland.''
   China has said little about the democratic pressures in Mongolia
that forced that country's Communist Party leadership to resign.
But according to one Soviet diplomat, the Chinese believe there is
a real danger the Mongol reform movement will spill over into
China's Inner Mongolia.
   Some 3.5 million Mongols live in the region, more than the 2
million ethnic brothers across the border in Mongolia. But China's
Mongols, who conquered the country under Genghis Khan in the 13th
century, are outnumbered in Inner Mongolia by 18 million Hans. They
also lack the cultural and religious unity of the Tibetans and
Moslems.
   China's anti-religion and forced assimilation policies of the
1950s and 1960s led to bloody clashes, including a failed Tibetan
uprising in 1959 that drove the Dalai Lama into exile.
   Since the late 1970s Beijing has tried to make amends by
rebuilding places of worship and encouraging traditional culture
and language.
   Minorities are exempted from the one-child population policy and
are beneficiaries of educational and anti-poverty programs. The
government pledges it will improve its record of appointing
non-Hans to official positions.
   At least in the south, along the border with Vietnam, Laos and
Burma, the policy seems to be working.
   The 14 million Zhuangs _ China's largest minority group _ the
5.5 million Yi people and the 5 million Miaos live quietly in
remote farming villages, known more for festivals and colorful
costumes than political consciousness.

   Jim Murray never figured his much-read sports
columns would pull a Pulitzer Prize.
   ``I always thought Pulitzers were for overturning a government
or exposing a scandal in the stock market,'' said the 70-year-old
Los Angeles Times sports columnist, who won the prize for
commentary. ``I thought Walter Lippmann got Pulitzers, not us
guys.''
   Murray, who's been writing columns for 30 years, is the fourth
sports columnist to win a Pulitzer Prize.
   Across the country Thursday, champagne flowed freely as winners
of the coveted prizes whooped it up.
   ``We haven't had this much excitement in this town since the
Union cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each other up Main
Street in 1862,'' said Bill Coughlin, executive editor of the
Washington (N.C.) Daily News, covered with champagne in a newsroom
ringing with shouts and marching music.
   The Daily News won one of two Pulitzers for public service
journalism for revealing that the city water supply was
contaminated with carcinogens.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer won the other public service Pulitzer,
for revealing a threat in blood supplies. The newspaper has taken
17 Pulitzers in 16 years. Gilbert Gaul, 38, who wrote the
prize-winning series, won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting at
the Pottsville (Pa.) Republican in 1979.
   Nicholas D. Kristof, 30, and Sheryl WuDunn, 30, of The New York
Times, who were married shortly before going overseas in March
1989, took the international reporting prize for their coverage of
China's political turmoil. ``Champagne will be a bit tough to find
but we'll certainly celebrate with Great Wall wine,'' Kristof said
in Beijing.
   At the San Francisco Chronicle, co-workers dragged a stunned
Allan Temko, 66, winner of the criticism prize, off to celebrate.
   ``Is it true?'' asked Temko. ``How extraordinary. I've always
been a bridesmaid.''
   ``I'm literally speechless,'' said Tamar Stieber, 34, of the
Albuquerque Journal, whose reports linking the dietary supplement
L-tryptophan to a rare blood disorder won the specialized reporting
prize.
   ``It's wonderful of course _ kind of like a lifelong dream,''
said Dave Curtin, 34, winning feature writer, at the Colorado
Springs Gazette Telegraph. Curtin wrote about a family's struggle
to recover after its members were severely burned in an explosion
that leveled their home.
   David C. Turnley's images of world upheavals won him the feature
photography prize. The winning portfolio by the Paris-based
photographer for the Detroit Free Press _ ``The Year in
Revolution'' _ contained eight pictures from China, two from the
Berlin Wall, two from Czechoslovakia and eight from Romania.
   Turnley, 34, got the word in Johannesburg, South Africa, in a
conference call his editors set up, supposedly to talk about
pending assignments.
   ``All I can say is I really wanted to win it in Buffalo and now
I have,'' said Tom Toles, 38, at The Buffalo News, who won for his
cartoons. ``Buffalo has had its hard times and I have a special
feeling for the city.''
   Not everyone was surprised.
   ``I can't say it was unexpected,'' said Executive Editor Robert
Ingle of the San Jose Mercury News, winner in general news
reporting for its coverage of the Oct. 17 earthquake. ``Everybody
who saw our coverage from the outside and the inside said it was
extraordinary.''
   In Minneapolis, Executive Editor Joel Kramer of the Star Tribune
of Minneapolis-St. Paul told a packed newsroom that ``old-fashioned
gumshoe reporting'' produced the story that won the investigative
reporting prize.
   The winner by Lou Kilzer, 39, and Chris Ison, 32, exposed the
St. Paul fire chief's alleged ties to people who profited from
arson, like companies that received millions of dollars in
insurance money.
   But 90 minutes into the celebrating, Kramer announced: ``This
party's almost over. We've got to put a paper out tomorrow.''
   Author Oscar Hijuelos, 38, was relaxing at a friend's house when
he heard his book won the prize for fiction. ``The Mambo Kings Play
Songs of Love'' tells of Cuban brothers who immigrate to the United
States and find minor celebrity on an episode of ``I Love Lucy.''
   ``This is so unexpected,'' Hijuelos said. ``My mother will be
happy.''
   Writer Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson of The
Sacramento Bee won the general nonfiction prize for ``And Their
Children After Them.'' The book picks up 50 years after James
Agee's ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' about 22 Alabama
sharecroppers.
   ``I really felt my odds were better in the lottery than for
this,'' said Williamson.
   Sebastian de Grazia, 72-year-old winner of the biography prize
for his ``Machiavelli In Hell,'' said a celebration was planned at
his Princeton, N.J., home with ``the traditional bottle of red
wine.''
   ``It has to be Tuscan wine,'' he added, in honor of his subject.
   Poetry winner Charles Simic, 51, was in Delaware on a reading
tour.
   ``I always hate to get these calls from my wife,'' he said. ``I
always think something happened, like the car got wrecked or the
basement is overflooded. But I could hear by her voice there was
something special, and she told me right away. It astonished me.''
   Second-time Pulitzer winner August Wilson, 44, who earned the
drama prize for ``The Piano Lesson,'' said his first thought was
```Wow, this is No. 2.' It made me want to go right to my
typewriter and start another one.''
   Composer Mel Powell, 67, was giving a lesson when he learned he
had won the music prize for ``Duplicates: A Concerto for Two Pianos
and Orchestra,'' which was commissioned for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic.
   ``I expect (my students) will pay much more attention to what I
say now,'' he said.

   The dollar strengthened slightly against the

lost moderately.
   The dollar closed the week at 158.42 yen, up 0.42 yen from
Thursday's close of 158.00 yen. After opening at 158.27 yen, the
currency ranged between 158.22 yen and 158.48 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 409.28

   In the bond market, the price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bonds slipped 0.26 points to 86.04 as of 3:00 p.m., down

from the previous day's 7.295 percent.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities Co.,
attributed the Nikkei index's fall to index-linked arbitrage
selling after Thursday's gains. Such arbitrage trading attempts to
take profits from differences between stocks and stock index
futures.

<HEAD>Asking Price For a Sentimental Journey Can Top $1 Million</HEAD>

   A pilot on a sentimental journey
once upon a time could pick up a surplus World War II fighter for
about $2,000. But the asking price now can soar higher than $1
million.
   Hoping to cash in on a craze that has become a rich man's hobby,
the Museum of Flying in this city with a rich aviation history
plans an auction of historic aircraft on May 19 and 20.
   ``We believe this will be the most historic auction of antique
aircraft ever,'' museum President David Price said. ``It's like
mounting a Broadway show. You don't know if it's going to work
until opening night.''
   Apollo astronauts Wally Schirra and Buzz Aldrin were among
aerospace notables who showed up Thursday to lend their support at
a preview of the planes listed for sale.
   Planes that were once abandoned in rusty hangars and barns have
been lovingly restored. P-51 Mustang fighters that once escorted
bombers through Nazi flak sport fresh paint jobs and jaunty names
like ``Stiletto.''
   A few years after the war, Price said, a shrewd bargainer could
pick up a surplus Mustang at a country air field for as little as
$2,000. The same plane now commands a $500,000 pricetag or better.
   A rare restored P-38 Lightning twin-boom fighter of the sort
that once knocked down Japanese ``Zero'' fighters in the Pacific is
on the auction block for more than $1 million. Rarity dictates
price.
   ``Unfortunately, they are perishable,'' Price said. ``If you
don't fly them, they deteriorate. And sometimes, they crash.''
   Proceeds of the auction will support aviation scholarships and
museum restoration. Price hopes some investors or altruists will
buy airplanes, then keep them at the museum where they will be
maintained in flying condition.
   A rich history has flamed the passion for buying and flying such
planes, said Price, who operates golf courses for a living but
comes to life when he is flying a Spitfire dubbed ``Evelyn.''
   Hundreds of thousands of people attend air shows every year and
the Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington is the best attended of all
the Smithsonian Institution displays.
   ``The fighter planes hark back to chivalry and knighthood,''
Price said. ``The men who flew them were heroes, and everyone
responds to that, I think.''
   Children, particularly, are drawn to the flying exhibits, Price
said.
   ``The kids can smell the gasoline, and they can see that these
airplanes are not relics,'' Price said. ``They're not mummified.''
   ``These planes are works of art in their own right,'' said
Donald Douglas Jr., whose father built the DC-3 and countless other
planes made famous in war and peace.
   The auction will be held at the museum grounds, next to the
Santa Monica Airport's runways, on the site where Army Air Corps
planes built by Douglas departed in 1924 on a historic
round-the-world flight.
   One of the biplanes from that flight hangs in the museum.
Another is at the Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington.

<HEAD>Prostitute In Barney Frank Controversy Pleads Innocent to Drug
Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The male prostitute at the center of ethics
allegations against Rep. Barney Frank has pleaded innocent to drug
and assault charges stemming from a traffic confrontation with an
off-duty police officer.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Hearing Commissioner Kaye
Christian on Thursday ordered Stephen L. Gobie held in lieu of
$2,500 bond and scheduled a status hearing for May 8 before Judge
Joseph Ryan.
   Gobie was charged with possession of marijuana, possession of
drug paraphernalia, simple assault and destruction of property in
connection with the Wednesday incident. Each of the four
misdemeanor charges carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail
and a $1,000 fine.
   Gobie did not speak during his four-minute appearance. His plea
was entered by his attorney, Lawrence Baskir, who attorney asked
for a jury trial.
   Gobie was arrested Wednesday afternoon after D.C. Police Officer
Karen Zibrat noticed an automobile being driven erratically, nearly
striking her personal car and another vehicle, said police
department spokesman Officer Ed Wilson.
   When Zibrat approached the car at a stop light, Gobie got out,
jumped on the roof of her car and broke through the sunroof, said
Wilson. Gobie fell into the car, where he struggled there with
Zibrat, according to the police account.
   Gobie became well-known last year when he said he had been
operating a prostitution service out of the Capitol Hill apartment
of Frank, D-Mass. Gobie, who was living with Frank at the time,
said the congressman was aware that his home was being used for
those purposes.
   Frank admitted he paid Gobie for sex but has denied any
knowledge of the prostitution service. The House ethics committee
is investigating Gobie's allegations.
   Gobie was tested for drugs following his arrest, but the results
were not made public.

   Customers who thought they were buying
original prints by four famous artists will share in a $635,000
settlement between the government and Austin Galleries after the
works turned out to be phony.
   Illinois-based Austin collected a total of about $2 million at
galleries in Chicago and California for prints that were worth $50
each, said Heather Hippsley, a Federal Trade Commission attorney.
   Customers were told the prints were limited editions by Salvador
Dali, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro and would be good
investments, Ms. Hippsley said.
   The prices ranged from a few hundred dollars to several thousand
dollars, she said.
   Austin and its president and sole shareholder, Donald Austin,
will pay $625,000 to settle the case. Another Austin official,
JoAnne Granquist, will pay $10,000, the government said.
   The FTC will notify Austin customers of the settlement, but Ms.
Hippsley said she did not know how many people were bilked. The
agreement will become final when approved by a federal judge in
Chicago.
   As part of the deal, Austin also will surrender 400 prints,
which the government claims are fakes.
   Donald Austin was away from gallery headquarters in Palatine,
Ill., and not available for comment Thursday.

<HEAD>Congressional Black Caucus Asked to Help in Police Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black U.S. Capitol Police officers who have
complained of racial discrimination have asked for help from the
Congressional Black Caucus.
   ``We are black police officers and expected the Congressional
Black Caucus to be the first in line to support our cause,'' Sgt.
Ronald L. Richardson, executive director of the Capitol Police
chapter of the National Black Police Association, said Thursday.
   ``It has become crystal clear that even after following all the
rules and going through all the proper channels, no one on Capitol
Hill is serious about our plight,'' Richardson told a news
conference.
   Black officers say top commanders, all of whom are white, have
discriminated in promotion and training practices and engaged in
racial harassment. There are 1,238 officers on the force, including
336 blacks.
   Among the top ranks of lieutenant, captain, inspector, deputy
chief, assistant chief and chief, there are 61 whites and four
blacks. The top-ranking black officer is a captain.
   Responding to the allegations, Capitol police spokesman Dan
Nichols said that it ``has been our position that we do not want to
mediate these issues through the press.''
   ``We have asked and are awaiting them to come forth with
substantive issues,'' Nichols said.

<HEAD>Undercover Agents in Personnel Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are charging that
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials unlawfully
retaliated against undercover agents in Houston for writing to
their congressmen.
   The complaint filed Wednesday with the federal Merit Systems
Protection Board said the retaliation came after the anti-smuggling
agents told lawmakers a change of assignment compromised their
undercover identifies.
   The 18-count complaint filed by the U.S. Office of Special
Counsel sought disciplinary action against three officials of the
Houston district office of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, alleging they engaged in ``prohibited personnel
practices.''
   Named in the complaint were District Director Ronald Parra,
Deputy District Director Michael McMahon and Carey Murphy,
assistant district director for investigations.
   The agents complained about a switch from anti-smuggling duty to
employer-relations work created by a 1986 immigration law. Not only
were their undercover identities jeopardized, they said, but they
were told to falsify time cards and record time spent on employer
relations as anti-smuggling hours.
   After writing to lawmakers, the six agents and two supervisors
received low performance appraisals or were pressured to take
unwanted transfers, according to a separate investigation by the
General Accounting Office.
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said the Merit Systems Protection
Board is the ``appropriate forum'' for the complaints and would not
comment further.

   One of three engines failed on a United
Airlines Boeing 727 but the aircraft landed safely, authorities
said. None of the 147 passengers and crew were injured.
   The engine on the Calgary, Alberta-to-San Francisco Flight 1531
failed midway between stops in Spokane, Wash., and Portland. The
plane landed at 5:10 p.m. at Portland International Airport, said a
dispatcher for airport operator Port of Portland who refused to
give her name.
   United officials were trying to determine the cause of the
engine problem.
   In St. Louis, meanwhile, a TWA jetliner bound for Moline, Ill.,
returned to Lambert Airport on Thursday night after it lost tread
from a landing wheel during takeoff and a hydraulic hose severed, a
spokesman said.
   TWA Flight 641, a DC-9 with 89 people aboard bound for Moline,
Ill., and Sioux City, Iowa, landed safely and nobody was injured,
TWA spokesman Don Morrison said.
   Morrison said the DC-9's pilot operated its landing gear
manually. He said the tire stripped of its tread was still inflated
when the plane landed.

   Gold that sank with the SS Central America
rested at the bottom of the Atlantic for more than 130 years; no
one knows when the answer to who owns the treasure will emerge from
the courts.
   ``There has to be some end to this,'' said U.S. District Judge
Richard B. Kellam as he closed the record on the case Thursday
after eight days of arguments over who should have ownership of the
fortune _ Columbus-America Discovery Group, which located the
treasure, or a group of insurance companies, which paid off the
loss in 1857.
   Originally, more than 40 insurance companies filed for a stake
in the treasure. That has been whittled down to about 10.
   Columbia University and two treasure hunters also are seeking
part of the pie. The New York City school claims sonar surveys done
by one of its researchers and paid for by the two businessmen were
used to locate the wreck. Kellam gave all sides 60 days in which to
submit briefs on their arguments, followed in 21 days with replies
to the briefs. Oral arguments are scheduled for July 11.
   After reading the voluminous file of the proceedings and going
over the boxes of exhibits, Kellam will issue a decision.
   Attorneys from all sides have said any ruling most likely will
be appealed to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The gold was lost when the SS Central America sank 1{ miles
below the Atlantic surface off the coast of South Carolina in an
1857 hurricane. The ship was en route from Panama to New York City
carrying gold and passengers from the California gold fields.
   The portion of the gold cargo insured was estimated at $1.2
million at the time. Columbus-America officials say the current
value of the gold could be as high as $1 billion. The Ohio-based
group has raised about one ton of gold ingots and coins; about two
tons remains on the ocean floor, they said.
   Columbus-America attorneys have argued that only through
scientific research and technology was the group _ made up of more
than 100 investors _ able to locate the wreck. Columbus-America
said it spent $10 million in the 13-year search and is entitled to
the ownership of the treasure.
   The insurance companies say they paid off on the loss and never
abandoned their implied ownership of the treasure. Not all of the
gold was insured. Business records that would include descriptions
of the insured cargo and proof the claims were paid no longer exist.

<HEAD>Experts Say Fear Of Stigma, Isolation Add to Rural Mental Health
Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAM SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MARSHALL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Years of financial hardship have touched
off record numbers of suicides and raised the incidence of
drug-taking, depression and child abuse in rural America, officials
say.
   Mental health problems are growing faster in rural areas than in
cities, but rural mental health services remain woefully
inadequate, according to a parade of witnesses Thursday at the
first of three nationwide hearings by the National Advisory Mental
Health Council and the National Mental Health Leadership Forum.
   ``Rural America has gone through some wrenching times,'' said
Bob Bergland, executive vice president of the National Rural
Electric Cooperative Association.
   ``Mining, timber and farming went to pot in the past decade,''
he said. ``The repercussions were painful _ record numbers of farm
foreclosures, high unemployment and a death spiral for many rural
enterprises.''
   Paul Lasley, associate professor of sociology at Iowa State
University said the isolation, fierce independence and fear of
being stigmatized set rural residents apart from urbanites with
mental disorders.
   ``When adversity struck in rural America, the victims were often
left alone to deal with their problems,'' he said.
   Lasley recalled how one central Iowa farmer asked to resign from
his church's board of deacons once it was learned he had lost his
farm.
   ``At the very time that social support was needed, his own
church cast him aside,'' he said.
   Myrt Armstrong, executive director of the Mental Health
Association in North Dakota, said that out of 70 suicides in North
Dakota last year, 20 were directly farm-related.
   ``In the heartland, we have always lived by rules like `where
there's a will, there's a way' or `hard work never killed anyone'
or even `you reap what you sow,''' she said.
   ``But those who have had a steel determination and have worked
extremely hard are reaping a bitter harvest, often ending in
depression and suicide.''
   That stoic independence admired in rural people has become a
roadblock to seeking help, Bergland said.
   ``Heaven knows you'll never get a farmer to walk voluntarily
into a mental health center and ask someone to hold his hand,'' he
said.
   Several who spoke described farm families who cling to their
privacy and fear letting others in on their problems. That, in
turn, deepens their isolation, raises their anxiety, and leads them
to feeling guilty and ashamed.
   The key to restoring the fabric of rural America, the experts
said, lies in dispelling the fear of reaching out for help.
   Bergland suggested that mental health facilities be combined
with other health-care centers to lessen the stigma, and that
mental health training be geared more toward the needs of rural
communities.
   Said Armstrong: ``The only hope for people in this kind of
trouble lies in other people _ people who can listen, help sort
things out, and make intelligent referrals to other resources.''
   ``The fabric of rural life has been torn, and once mended will
never be quite the same again,'' she said. ``Healing is possible,
and we hope that if we pay attention to the healing process, and
mend the fabric with care, we will wind up with a whole cloth once
again.''

<HEAD>Nikkei Falls, Dollar Up Moderately</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices fell in light trading on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today, and the dollar rose moderately against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
182.92 points Thursday, lost 409.28 points, or 1.38 percent,
closing the week at 29,213.92.
   Trading was thin, with 320 million shares changing hands on the
market's first section, down from Thursday's 430 million shares.
   ``Volume was extremely small. The index came down on small-lot
selling amid a wait-and-see mood, rather than in active buying and
selling,'' said a dealer with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The dealer said many market participants retreated to the
sidelines to watch movements in the foreign exchange and bond
markets.
   Yoshihide Koyama, an equity analyst with Nikko Securites, also
attributed the decline in the Nikkei index to investor worries over
speculation that Japan's central bank may raise its official
discount rate once again in an attempt to halt the yen's recent
decline.
   A Bank of Japan official refused to comment on the speculation.
   On March 20 the bank raised its key rate, charged on loans to
commercial banks, by 1 percentage point to 5.25 percent. Higher
interest rates tend to support a country's currency but discourage
stock investment.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar ended the week at
158.42 yen, up 0.42 yen from Thursday's close of 158.00 yen. After
opening at 158.27 yen, the currency ranged between 158.22 yen and
158.48 yen.
   Currency dealers said trading was quiet throughout the day as
most overseas markets were closed for the Good Friday holiday.
   Kouhei Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar stayed
in a very narrow range because of the small number of market
players and no major market-related news.
   On the bond market, the price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bonds closed at 85.90 points, down from Thursday's close
of 86.30. Their yield rose to 7.380 percent from the previous day's
7.295 percent.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister: France Victim of `Flase Trial' Over Hostage
Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France had been
the victim of a ``false trial'' after newspapers across Europe
criticized his praise of Libya for aiding the release of three
hostages held by Palestinian guerrillas.
   The hostages _ a French woman, her Belgian companion and their
young child _were freed in Beirut this week and emerged from
seclusion Thursday, when they met briefly with the media.
   But they refused to answer questions, saying any comment might
jeopardize efforts to free four other Belgians being held.
   Since arriving in France on Tuesday, Jacqueline Valente, Fernand
Houtekins and their daughter, Sophie-Liberte, had stayed at a
military hospital outside Paris.
   Later Thursday, the three left for Belgium, according to Ms.
Valente's brother-in-law, Andre Metral.
   At the news conference, Houtekins said the Belgian government
had requested ``total discretion'' while it negotiated to free four
of his relatives still in captivity.
   Meanwhile, France insisted it did not deal directly with the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, led by terrorist Abu Nidal, and denied
obtaining the hostages' freedom by agreeing to give Libya three
Mirage fighter jets.
   Dumas, questioned Thursday by the Senate Committee on Defense
and Foreign Affairs, said there were ``no transactions with the
abductors'' and ``no link'' between the hostages and the three
warplanes.
   The hostages' release was obtained through contacts with several
Arab countries, including Syria, Morocco and Egypt as well as
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, he said.
   President Francois Mitterrand Thursday sent telegrams of thanks
to Morocco's King Hassan II, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid.
   Dumas said the release of the airplanes _ which had been held
for four years after Libya sent them back to France for repairs _
did not violate a European Community embargo on arms deliveries to
Libya.
   Since the hostages' release, questions have emerged about
several details of their abduction.
   The daughter of Houtekins and Ms. Valente was widely described
as a 2-year-old, born in captivity after the family's yacht was
seized in the eastern Mediterranean in November 1987.
   But Metral said Wednesday the girl was 4, roughly the age she
appears to be physically. That led to speculation in the French
press that the group may have been abducted much earlier than
previously reported.
   Metral also said the ex-hostages were held in Lebanon, not Libya
as widely believed.
   The Abu Nidal group reportedly has linked freedom for the
remaining Belgians to the release of a Palestinian jailed in
Belgium for a terrorist attack.
   In addition to the hostages held by Abu Nidal's organization, 18
Westerners are held in Lebanon, mainly by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
groups.
   They include eight Americans. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.

   The county coroner announced his resignation
amid reports that the high homicide rate is straining his staff,
slowing autopsies and causing bodies to be left on the streets for
hours.
   Ronald Kornblum, 57, will step down July 1 after eight years on
the job because the administrative job was unfulfilling and he
wants to resume teaching and writing, Coroner's Department
spokesman Bob Dambacher said Thursday.
   The office has come under fire for moving too slowly on
autopsies, leaving bodies at crime and accident scenes for hours
and, most embarrassingly, bouncing corpses onto freeways from old
coroner vehicles with bad door locks.
   A recent audit found that staff shortages coupled with a high
homicide rate is straining the coroner's office to the breaking
point.
   Kornblum, who declined to comment on his resignation, took over
as coroner for the nation's most populous county in 1982.
   He replaced Thomas Noguchi, who was removed for serving as a
consultant on cases outside the county.
   The low-key Kornblum's style contrasted with Noguchi, the
``coroner to the stars'' who wrote a best-selling book about his
better-known cases.
   As the chief medical examiner-coroner, Kornblum directed a staff
of 160 responsible for an annual caseload of about 18,000 deaths,
including 7,000 bodies that require autopsies.
   ``Overall, the report indicates the coroner is fulfilling his
legal responsibilities but is experiencing operation and managerial
difficulties,'' Los Angeles County Auditor-Controller Mark
Bloodgood said in a letter accompanying the audit.
   Kornblum said he agreed with most of the report's suggestions
and that the office was implementing some of them, but he said
certain changes _ such as processing all bodies in 24 hours _ were
impossible.
   ``Considering the limited size of the department's budget and
the overwhelming workload, this goal is neither achievable nor
realistic, although highly desirable,'' he said.
   Kornblum was defended by some county officials, including
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who first disclosed Kornblum's
resignation.
   ``He has made significant improvement in the department and
demonstrated leadership and strength. He has really turned that
operation around,'' Schabarum said in a statement.
   Kornblum previously served as the department's chief of
forensics medicine. Before that, he was medical examiner-coroner
for Ventura County.

<HEAD>Appeal Filed in Divorce Battle Over Seven Frozen Embryos</HEAD>

   A judge's ruling legally protecting
seven frozen human embryos gives them greater rights than much more
developed fetuses have under abortion laws, a laywer says in an
appeal.
   Judge W. Dale Young, saying that life begins at conception,
issued the ruling in September in the divorce case of Junior Lewis
Davis and Mary Sue Davis.
   The only contested portion of the divorce was what to do with
the seven embryos, which the Davises created in December 1988 in an
in vitro fertilization program at a Knoxville hospital.
   The two-day-old embryos have been frozen since then. Testimony
at the divorce trial indicated the embryos have developed to
between four and eight cells each.
   Mrs. Davis, 29, testified that said she wanted control of the
embryos in an attempt to have children. She cannot have children
naturally.
   Davis, 31, said he did not want the embryos used in any fashion
_ especially by his ex-wife _ without his consent.
   After hearing four days of testimony, Young accorded the embryos
the same legal status as children would have in a custody dispute
between their parents. He then awarded custody of the embryos to
Mrs. Davis, though he also barred her from using them until appeals
are decided.
   Davis' lawyer, Janet Mayfield, filed an appeal Thursday in the
state Court of Appeals.
   ``Inexplicably, Judge Young determined that all the previous
decisions and statutory guidelines were irrelevant for determining
when the unborn enjoy a protectable legal status,'' the appeal says.
   The appeal also contends Young should not have strayed into the
field of morals and ethics in reaching his decision.
   ``Judge Young has independently quantified the value
attributable to the existence of a four- to eight-cell embryo being
maintained in frozen storage, notwithstanding that such conclusions
have eluded scholars, legislators, philosophers, religious leaders,
ethicists and theologians since the inception of the technology,''
Mayfield wrote.
   And despite his ruling that ``life begins at conception,'' Young
did not have the authority to give the embryos legal standing, the
appeal argues.
   ``Neither the state laws nor the federal constitution ... confer
any protectable legal status upon the unborn before viability,''
the appeal says, adding that the decision ``cannot even be
reconciled with well-accepted methods of birth control.''
   Attorneys for Mrs. Davis, who is remarried and living in
Florida, have 30 days to respond to the appeal.

<HEAD>Four Given Death Sentences for Economic Crimes</HEAD>

   A Shanghai court sentenced four people to death
and four others to life in prison for economic crimes, a Shanghai
daily reported.
   The Liberation Daily, in its Thursday edition seen in Beijing
today, said two others were given sentences of five to three years.
   All 10 were tried together, and their crimes included
embezzling, receiving bribes for signing contracts and demanding
large amounts in compensation from foreign businessmen unable to
meet contracts, the newspaper said.
   The graft totaled $274,000, it said.
   China's official press recently has carried numerous reports of
death sentences being handed down as part of a government campaign
against corruption, prostitution and other crimes.
   Canton executed 31 criminals on one day in January, according to
the reports.
   In the past month, five people were executed in Shanghai for
robbing taxis, six were executed in Canton for abducting and raping
women, three were sentenced to death in a city near Canton for
selling tainted alcohol and four were sentenced to death in
northern Shaanxi province for robbery, according to the reports.
   China does not release figures on the number of people executed
each year, although foreign human rights groups say it could be in
the thousands. Most cases are not reported in the national press.
   Those given the death sentence have the right to appeal. But
almost all appeals are rejected, and executions, generally with a
bullet to the back of the head, usually are carried out within days
of sentencing.

<HEAD>Pilgrims Trace Christ's Path in Tense Old City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian pilgrims carried crosses along the
traditional route of Jesus Christ's martyrdom today to mark Good
Friday amid tensions over a Jewish settlement established in the
Christian quarter of the old city.
   Thousands of pilgrims began processions along the Via Dolorosa
at 9 a.m., stopping to sing hymns and pray at the Stations of the
Cross leading to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, venerated by
many Christians as the site of Christ's tomb.
   Dozens of paramilitary border police armed with assault rifles
and tear gas grenades walked in the narrow streets of Jerusalem's
old walled city along with Christians from around the world.
   The heavy police presence followed rioting Thursday near the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher, but most of the pilgrims seemed more
intent on tracing the path of Christ than in getting caught up in
the friction between Jerusalem's Christians and Jews.
   ``Jerusalem is beautiful. I could not imagine it until I saw
it,'' said Mervat Azer, a travel agent from Jersey City, New
Jersey. ``We are praying near the place where Christ was buried.
... Tomorrow his light will be very bright.''
   Paul Christiansen of Copenhagen, Denmark, said he was saddened
by the pain Jesus suffered on the cross and by the current
religious trouble in Jerusalem.
   ``We noticed yesterday there was tear gas and fighting,'' said
Christiansen, 29. ``It is sad. Why it is necessary for people to
fight?''
   The rioting came as Christian clerics and their supporters
protested the settling of 150 Jews in the old city's Christian
quarter.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters after a priest
tore down a poster showing the Israeli Star of David that had been
placed over a cross on the door of a disputed building.
   Greek Orthodox Church officials maintain the sale of the
building to the Israelis was illegal and have taken their case to
court. Lower court rulings have said the Jewish settlers must
return the property to the church, decisions which are being
appealed.
   Jerusalem's old city is divided into jealously guarded ethnic
quarters that are home to 50,000 Moslems, about 7,000 Christians
and 4,000 Jews.
   The entire area is caught up in the Israeli-Palestinian struggle
since the old city is part of the land captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Israel has annexed the walled city, which includes the last
remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple, and surrounding Arab east
Jerusalem into its capital. But the city's 140,000 Arab residents
want to be part of a Palestinian state. The annexation of the
territory also is not recognized by most foreign governments.
   Palestinian Christians, whose numbers are shrinking compared to
both Moslems and Jews, saw the settlement of the Jews under police
guard as particularly offensive since it occurred during Easter
week.
   Today's colorful processions appeared to come off without any
trouble beyond the usual pushing and shoving along the narrow stone
streets.
   As the Greek Orthodox began their procession at about 10:30
a.m., women ran from the crowd to kiss the 2-yard-long cross partly
supported by Diodorus I, the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem,
who collapsed during the police tear gasing Thursday.
   Waves of pilgrims were pushed along the Via Dolorosa, sometimes
with Israeli police holding hands to clear a path.
   The city was especially crowded because both the Eastern
Orthodox churches and the Western Latin-rite churches were
celebrating Easter on the same day.
   The Easter celebrations by the two churches, which can sometimes
be five weeks apart, also came amid the Jewish Passover festival
and the Moslem's Ramadan month of fasting.
   Israeli officials estimated 45,000 foreigners would visit
Jerusalem during during Easter week.
   In the past, scuffles have broken out on days in which the Latin
and Orthodox Easter processions intersect, but Rene Koutroulis of
New York City said members of the two churches seemed to have put
aside their conflicts for the holiday.
   ``Everybody, I think, is united, and I see on their faces that
they came in good faith,'' said Ms. Koutroulis, who is active in
Greek-American welfare work. ``Today we are united. Tomorrow we may
fight again.''

<HEAD>Woman With Interest in Jack the Ripper Ruled Insane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered psychiatric care instead of
prison for a woman who tried to murder a man with an ax in a ritual
she allegedly hoped would resurrect Jack the Ripper.
   Circuit Judge William D. Gardner found Deborah Kazuck innocent
by reason of insanity of attempted first-degree intentional
homicide and ordered her sent to a psychiatric hospital. A jury
earlier Thursday had convicted her of the charge.
   Ms. Kazuck, 27, allegedly told police that in a previous life
she was the mother of the 19th-century serial killer who stabbed
and disemboweled at least five London prostitues in the autumn of
1888.
   She testified Wednesday that she never plotted the May 29 attack
and only struck the man with the ax when he tried to sexually
assault her.
   But two co-defendants, Ramona Barry and Catherine Lipsham, said
Ms. Kazuck had asked them to lure the victim, Jeffrey Meka, 27, to
an apartment where they planned to kill him. The plot, they said,
was called a ``kacking,'' a word combining ``Jack'' and ``killing.''
   The two pleaded guilty to the same charge last week under a plea
agreement that lawyers said included a recommendation for lenient
sentences. They are to be sentenced on May 25.
   They said Ms. Kazuck proposed killing Meka, draining his blood
and eating his kidneys during a ritual to revive Jack the Ripper.
   Meka said he was lured to the apartment and discovered Ms.
Kazuck behind a shower curtain. He said she lurched at him with the
ax and opened a gash over his eye that required 50 stitches.
   ``I honestly feel the judge did the right thing here,'' defense
attorney Alan A. Olshan said, adding he didn't think Ms. Kazuck
understood either decision in the trial.
   A first phase of the trial involved the criminal charge. The
second phase, during which Ms. Kazuck waived her right to a jury,
involved her plea of innocent by reason of mental disease or defect.
   Ms. Kazuck admitted she was fascinated with Jack the Ripper, and
regularly carried a backpack containing a hatchet, a drill and
knives.
   Defense psychiatrist William Cowley said Ms. Kazuck suffered
from paranoid schizophrenia and could not understand her acts were
wrong.
   A state psychiatrist, Frederick Fosdal, said she suffered from a
schizoid personality disorder but had no mental illness and should
be held responsible for the crime.

   Reporting and photographs from the Oct. 17
earthquake won Pulitzers for the Oakland Tribune and the San Jose
Mercury News, while their competitor, the San Francisco Chronicle,
won for architecture criticism.
   The Tribune award for spot news for photojournalism was its
first Pulitzer since 1950.
   ``The work of this staff prevailed over all of the other entries
because of its incredible clarity, the intensity, the closeness to
the action, the way our staff really got in close, and the
compassion for the victims,'' Robert Maynard, the Tribune's
publisher, said as the newspaper's staff celebrated noisily in the
background.
   The Tribune's photographers recorded the devastating
earthquake's traumatic detail, including rescue efforts on the
collapsed highway in Oakland, the San Francisco Marina District
ablaze and chaos across Northern California after the 7.1-magnitude
temblor struck.
   The photos were picked up by wire services and used in
publications around the world.
   Maynard recalled when he began rebuilding the newspaper seven
years ago, many people gave the Tribune poor odds of surviving in
the competitive San Francisco Bay area market.
   ``And we just persevered and built our team, and kept getting
better and better, knowing that if there ever was a day like Oct.
17, we would be able to rise to the challenge,'' he said.
   The Mercury News won its Pulitzer in the general news category
for its coverage of the quake and its aftermath, and Executive
Editor Robert Ingle said the award wasn't unexpected.
   ``Everybody who saw our coverage from the outside and the inside
said it was extraordinary,'' he said as employees celebrated in the
newsroom.
   ``It was the most extraordinary staff effort I have been
involved in 28 years of newspapering. In about five hours after the
earthquake we produced 12 open pages of solid reporting,
photographs and graphics ... and we delivered that throughout our
circulation area except for a few scattered areas in the
mountains,'' he said.
   San Francisco Chronicle architecture critic Allan Temko
responded to news of his Pulitzer just as co-workers dragged him
away for an impromptu celebration.
   ``Did I win?'' he said as applause was heard in the background.
``Is it true? How extraordinary. I've always been a bridesmaid.''
   Writer Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson of The
Sacramento Bee won Pulitzers in the general non-fiction category
for their book, ``And Their Children After Them.''
   Maharidge said he and Williamson spent three years commuting
from Sacramento to Alabama for their book that picked up where
James Agee left off 50 years ago with ``Let Us Now Praise Famous
Men.''
   Maharidge and Williamson found 11 of the original group of
sharecroppers interviewed by Agee plus 117 descendants. Most were
still living in poverty.
   ``We are completely surprised,'' said Williamson. ``I really
felt my odds were better in the lottery than for this.''

   On Monday, Tamar Stieber taped a plastic
bag over the hole where her car's passenger window used to be and
wondered how she was going to pay for the repairs.
   On Thursday, the Albuquerque Journal reporter won the top prize
in journalism, a Pulitzer, for specialized reporting. Her stories
late last year led to the national recall of a popular dietary
supplement, L-tryptophan.
   Ms. Stieber mused that she might use her prize check of $3,000
to fix her car, which flipped last weekend when she swerved to
avoid a tumbleweed north of Albuquerque. She escaped unhurt.
   Ms. Stieber, 34, became an instant celebrity in the Journal's
Santa Fe newsroom when the Pulitzer awards were announced Thursday
in New York. She was swamped with congratulations from friends and
fellow reporters and with telephone messages requesting interviews.
   She later traveled to Albuquerque, but not in her own car, to
receive the well-wishes of staffers at the Journal's headquarters.
She joined the newspaper last May.
   ``I didn't expect it (the Pulitzer),'' she said. ``I was writing
stories, working on deadline and I wasn't thinking of prizes.''
   Her horoscope this week ``talked about love, not the Pulitzer
Prize,'' she said.
   Ms. Stieber first reported in November that three doctors in
Santa Fe and Los Alamos had uncovered an unusual connection between
their patients and L-tryptophan.
   The patients were suffering from a sometimes fatal blood
disorder called eosinophilia-mylagia syndrome, which caused severe
muscle and joint pain.
   A week after Ms. Stieber's first article appeared, reports of
eosinophilia-mylagia syndrome surfaced in Arizona, Oregon,
Mississippi, Texas and Missouri.
   ``That's when I realized that this wasn't just a local
phenomenon,'' she said.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a do-not-use
recommendation. L-tryptophan, an amino acid fermented mainly in
Japan, has since been recalled by the FDA. More than 1,400 cases of
EMS have been identified.
   Ms. Stieber said covering the story was grueling and
time-consuming. She said she had to overcome the apprehension of
doctors to act on then-unproven allegations that the common
supplement may have been dangerous.
   ``The first week I couldn't sleep,'' she said, describing the
laborious week spent with her ``adrenalin really going.''
   Ms. Stieber credited her colleagues on the staff of the Journal
North, the newspaper's northern edition, for covering her regular
beats during the hectic first weeks of the L-tryptophan story.
   ``It was a story that required persistent reporting by Tamar,
working closely with her editor, Tim Coder,'' said Gerald Crawford,
editor of the Journal in Albuquerque.
   ``They had to overcome a number of obstacles, including
considerable skepticism and resistance from some state officials
who feared it would trigger a `scare.'
   ``Without these stories, it's difficult to say when or even if
the relationship between L-tryptophan and eosinophilia would have
been made,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Rodney Dangerfield of Editorial Cartooning' Gets Some Respect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Toles, the Buffalo News cartoonist once
labeled the ``Rodney Dangerfield of editorial cartooning,'' has
gotten journalism's most respected prize _ the Pulitzer.
   And the best thing about winning the Pulitzer for editorial
cartooning, Toles told colleagues who crowded into his cubicle
Thursday to celebrate, was that it came to him in the place he
holds most dear.
   ``All I can say is I really wanted to win it in Buffalo and now
I have,'' the soft-spoken cartoonist said. ``I'm from here. I've
had job offers from other cities but Buffalo has a special meaning
to me.''
   ``Buffalo has had its hard times and I have a special feeling
for the city,'' he said.
   Toles, 38, grew up in suburban Hamburg. His father was the
business editor of the Buffalo Times until it folded in 1939, but
Toles said he never planned to go into journalism, much less
cartooning.
   ``I drew as a kid _ every kid draws _ but I never took an art
lesson,'' he said.
   Toles was a staff artist for the campus newspaper at the State
University of New York at Buffalo. He was hired in 1973 as a
graphic artist at the now-defunct Buffalo Courier-Expresss.
   He initially did caricatures and other illustrative work, but
found his vocation when Douglas L. Turner, then the paper's editor,
asked him to do an editorial cartoon one day.
   Since Toles joined The Buffalo News when the Courier-Express
folded in 1982, his work has been syndicated nationally by
Universal Press Syndicate, and he was a finalist for the 1985
Pulitzer in editorial cartooning.
   A cover story in the Washington Journalism Review in December
1988 called Toles the ``Rodney Dangerfield of editorial
cartooning'' because he was well-respected in the profession but
not well known nationally.
   His bare-bones style of drawing, unconventional use of multiple
frames, self-described ``strange'' sense of humor and employment by
a newspaper not prominent nationally all contributed to his
obscurity, the magazine said.
   Murray Light, editor of the News, said he knew that obscurity
would someday vanish.
   ``We always had confidence that this day would come,'' he told
Toles. ``We're just absolutely so totally gratified for you and
your talent.''
   Toles, known for his environmentalism and outrage at military
spending at the expense of social programs, was honored for a
selection of 10 cartoons representing his best work of 1989.
   He said he thinks of his cartoons ``as an ongoing series, rather
than specific ones,'' but singled out cartoons on the subjects of
flag-burning and former President Reagan's farewell as among his
favorites.
   Toles is the second Buffalo News cartoonist to win a Pulitzer.
The late Bruce Shanks won the 1958 prize for a cartoon portraying
an American worker pondering newspaper accounts of corruption among
union leaders.

   The dollar was nearly motionless in extremely
light European trading this morning with almost all financial
centers closed for the long Easter weekend.
   Bullion markets were closed in London and Zurich.
   Markets in Milan, Belgium and Austria were the only ones open
for business, which dealers said was virtually nonexistent.
   ``It's a good day to read the newspaper,'' said one dealer for a
major foreign bank in Milan. ``There's virtually nothing going on.''
   The dollar stood at 1,229.50 lire at mid-morning in Milan, down
from Thursday's close of 1,231.50 lire.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.42 yen to a closing 158.42 yen. Dealers said
trading was quiet because most overseas markets were shut for the
Good Friday holiday.
   In Milan, the dollar was selling for 1.6727 West German marks,
down from 1.6730 marks in late European trading on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Cambodian guerrilla leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk said today he left his new home inside Cambodia on
the advice of Thai officials after heavy shelling by government
forces.
   The prince denied he intended to flee Sereipheap, which he
declared his home in February. The village is in a part of
northwestern Cambodia the guerrillas call ``liberated zones.''
   ``In reality it was my Thai escorts who decided to take me by
car to Surin,'' he said.
   The prince issued the statement in response to a British
Broadcasting Corp. report, which said he suffered ``a humiliating
defeat'' in Wedensday's attack by government troops.
   Sihanouk said that on Thursday he received a letter from Thai
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Gen. Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh saying he was deeply concerned about the prince's
security.
   He quoted Chavalit as writing: ``According to our intelligence,
(Phnom Penh) units in the area ... will continue to harass the
village with long-range weapons ... which is certainly not safe for
(you) and your family to go back to at the moment.''
   Chavalit said Sihanouk should remain in Thailand until the
situation improved, and the Thai government would provide him with
security, the guerrilla leader said.
   The Bangkok Post said the shelling began near Sereipheap early
Wednesday and Sihanouk and his wife, Princess Monique, and other
family members were evacuated about midday.
   At first they took shelter in bunkers in the village because the
attack was not expected to intensify, the report said.
   They were later moved to ``a safe location in Thailand'' after
leaving most of their belongings in Cambodia, the report said. The
other 700 villagers were evacuated at the same time and there were
no casualties, the report said.
   Sereipheap literally means ``freedom village'' in the Khmer
language. The prince, who heads the three-faction guerrilla
alliance fighting the Vietnamese-installed government, returned to
Cambodia to boost the morale of his fighters.
   Sihanouk, backed by the United States, last fled Cambodia when
Vietnamese troops invaded the country in late 1978. He lived for
the next 11 years in exile, dividing his time between China,
France, North Korea and Thailand.

   Filipino penitents were nailed to
crosses today, and others whipped themselves bloody as Asia's only
predominantly Christian nation marked the crucifixion of Jesus.
   About a dozen people were nailed to crosses in several
communities of central Luzon island, including a woman faith healer
in Kapitangan in her 14th Good Friday crucifixion.
   Police said another 10 penitents were nailed to crosses in
Cutud, about 15 miles west in Pampanga province.
   Penitents were nailed to the crosses for up to 10 minutes.
   About 500 people filled the yard outside a church in this
farming village to watch the crucifixion on a concrete stage at the
edge of a rice field. They shouted at photographers and onlookers
to make room for them to see the event.
   About the same number of people jostled each other to watch the
crucifixion from an adjacent lot, where vendors sold food and
drinks and others set up gambling tables.
   A man wearing dark glasses chanted Latin prayers under a blazing
noontime sun as two men dressed as Roman centurions hammered
four-inch nails into the palms and feet of faith healer Lucila
``Lucy'' Reyes, 32.
   Her followers, mostly women, burned incense and sang religious
songs. Others wept as Miss Reyes went into a trance, her body
shaking on the wooden cross.
   A follower placed a bottle of coconut oil at the foot of the
cross for ``benediction'' in treating ailments.
   Hours earler, male penitents with cloth-covered faces, whipped
their backs with wooden sticks tied to a lash in an annual ritual
to ``wash'' their sins or repay God for some miracles.
   They would lie face down on the concrete pavement on churchyard
in front of pictures of the 14 Stations of the Cross while being
whipped on the buttocks by their companions.
   In Cutud, about 3,000 people, including foreign tourists, turned
out to watch the crucifixions, which took place after flagellants
wandered through the dusty streets flogging themselves with sticks
of bamboo pitted with bits of glass.
   Those crucified in Cutud included Mario Castro, 40, who was
nailed to a cross for his 10th straight Good Friday.
   Castro said he pledged to undergo the bizarre ritual to give
thanks for the recovery of his mother from a serious illness.
Castro said today's ordeal marked the end of his crucifixions
because he was now ``spiritually fulfilled.''
   The crucifixions are a major tourist attraction, but they
brought a mixed response from foreigners.
   ``The Philippines is free to do this,'' said Didier Moreau, 44,
of Digon, France. ``This is just a Filipino play.''
   But a Japanese Christian, Hiroko Kawashima, 26, stared in
disbelief at the Cutud festivities and said: ``If Japanese
non-Christians could see this, they would not want to convert.''
   Origins of the annual crucifixion are difficult to trace. Local
residents say the practice was introduced by Spanish friars in the
16th century, but others claim it is a more recent phenomenon.

   An Israeli gunboat fired on a rubber boat
carrying three Palestinian guerrillas off the southern Lebanon
coast overnight, sinking it, security sources said today.
   The fate of the guerrillas could not be determined, a source
said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the gunboat intercepted the dinghy Thursday off the
coast opposite the Palestinian refugee camp of Rashidiyeh, south of
Tyre.
   Israeli sailors ``shouted orders to the three guerrillas aboard
the dinghy to surrender, then opened fire from machine guns,'' the
source said.
   The guerrillas did not return fire and the dinghy sank, he said.
   Israeli gunboats patrol Lebanon's southern coast to prevent
Palestinian guerrillas from infiltrating by sea into Israel.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has a 56 percent approval rating
among blacks, a huge increase over the ratings given former
President Reagan, according to a new CBS News-New York Times poll.
   Only 13 percent of blacks supported Reagan at about the same
point in his presidency, CBS Evening News reported Thursday.
   In May 1982, Reagan had a 73 percent disapproval rating among
blacks; in the current poll, 26 percent of blacks surveyed
disapproved of Bush, said Kathleen A. Frankovic, of the CBS
network's polling division.
   CBS-Times polls conducted during Reagan's entire time in office
found he had an average 67 percent disapproval rating among blacks,
Frankovic said.
   The new survey is the fourth consecutive Times-CBS News poll in
the last six months in which a majority of blacks said they
approved of Bush's handling of his job, the Times reported in
today's editions.
   For the last 30 years, five out of six blacks have voted for the
Democratic presidential candidate, no matter who the nominee was,
CBS reported.
   In the new poll, one out of 10 blacks said they probably would
vote for Bush against a Democratic candidate in 1992, while another
20 percent said their choice would depend on who was running, the
Times said.
   One-third of the blacks surveyed, and 46 percent of the whites,
said their opinion of Bush had improved since he became president,
the Times said.
   Blacks were evenly divided on whether Bush is doing a good job
handling the war on drugs, while whites approved 56 percent to 35
percent, the Times said. White respondents gave Bush an overall
approval rating of 75 percent to 14 percent.
   The telephone poll of 1,515 adult Americans, including 403
blacks, was conducted March 30-April 2. The margin of error for the
entire survey is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for blacks it
is 5 percentage points.

<HEAD>Dates Announced For Premier Li Peng's Visit To Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng will visit the Soviet Union April
23-26, becoming the first Chinese head of government to travel to
Moscow since 1964, the Foreign Ministry said today.
   The ministry said in a statement that Li ``will have an
extensive and in-depth exchange of views with Soviet leaders on the
bilateral relations and major international issues of common
concern.''
   Li was invited to visit the Soviet Union in May, when Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev made the first trip to Beijing by a
Soviet leader in three decades. Pro-democracy activists in China
used the visit to promote their demands for reforms, but the
movement was crushed in June.
   China's leaders have since taken a hard-line Communist approach,
ignoring Moscow's reform program of glasnost and perestroika.
   The exchange of visits has marked the end of decades of
hostility between the two socialist states and signaled a gradual
warming of political and economic relations.
   Soviet sources said Li will meet twice with Gorbachev in Moscow
and will make a one-day trip to Kiev. They said it is likely the
two leaders will sign an agreement to promote bilateral trade and
an accord of general principles on easing military tensions along
the 4,300-mile common border.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological differences
around 1960, and fought a brief border war in 1969.
   Relations have steadily improved since the mid-1980s when
Gorbachev came to power, particularly after Gorbachev withdrew
Soviet forces from Afghanistan and pledged to reduce Soviet
military forces in Asia.
   However, China has emphasized it will never return to the close
relations with the Soviet Union it had in the 1950s.
   Chinese leaders have also distanced themselves from the
democratic reforms now taking place in the Soviet Union and East
Europe.
   Although China has not publicly commented on such actions as the
Soviet Communist Party's renunciation of its monopoly on power,
internal documents reportedly have branded Gorbachev a revisionist.
   Li studied electrical engineering in the Soviet Union in the
1950s and favors traditional Soviet-style central planning and
emphasis on heavy industry.

<HEAD>Sharp Increase in Cases of Hepatitis A Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reported cases of hepatitis A in the United
States increased 58 percent between 1983 and 1989, the federal
Centers for Disease Control said.
   Hepatitis A, a liver inflammation usually linked to poor hygiene
or drug use, causes fever, fatigue and aches. In rare cases, it can
be fatal.
   The CDC said the number of cases increased from 9.2 per 100,000
population to 14.5 per 100,000 from 1983-89. However, the
Atlanta-based agency noted Thursday that many who get the illness
show no symptoms and their cases go unreported.
   The best-known method of spreading hepatitis A is when a
hepatitis carrier handles food such as salads, sandwiches or other
items that are not cooked.
   However, ``it is important to stress that a majority (of
hepatitis cases) are not associated with food-borne outbreaks,''
said Dr. Miriam Alter, a CDC hepatitis specialist.
   ``About a third are associated with close personal contact with
someone else who has the disease. About 12 percent are associated
with day-care centers, and there, too, the disease is also acquired
from someone else who had it,'' she said.
   Six percent of the cases are brought back to the United States
from developing countries, where hepatitis is endemic, and the
cause of about a third of the cases cannot be traced, she said.
   There also are increasing reports of the illness being spread
through sharing of contaminated needles by drug users.
   There is no vaccine for hepatitis A, but infection can be
prevented with gamma globulin shots after exposure takes place.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today his
meeting with British Minister Margaret Thatcher in Burmuda is an
important effort for the Western allies to ``stay in close touch in
these times of dramatic change in Europe.''
   Bush, who departed nearby Andrews Air Force Base shortly after
daybreak, told reporters en route that ``Thatcher has a clear view
of the reality of the world.'' Their meeting was one of a series
Bush plans with NATO allies in advance of his five-day summit with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev beginning May 30.
   In a wide-ranging exchange with reporters, Bush was asked about
Gorbachev's comment to visiting U.S. senators that Moscow can solve
the secession crisis in Lithuania without any ``lectures'' from
Washington. ``I can understand his position,'' Bush said, adding
that the Soviet view is largely an internal matter. Because of
history, we don't view it that way. I will continue to say what I
think.''
   Discussing the East German legislature's resolution asking
forgiveness for Nazi atrocities, Bush said, ``I'm inclined to think
you ought to forgive, not forget ... I think forgiveness is
something I feel very strongly about.''
   Bush said his meeting with Thatcher one of a ``continued series
of consultations. It is extremely important that allies stay in
close touch in these times of dramatic change.''
   ``I feel I have a very frank and open relationship with Margaret
Thatcher,'' Bush said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said on Thursday that
Bush ``wants to go into the session with Gorbachev with a firm view
of the attitudes of other members of the alliance.''
   Next month's superpower summit, arms control negotiations, the
unrest in Lithuania and German reunification headed the agenda for
today's the daylong session.
   Bush planned to brief Mrs. Thatcher on his talks last week with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. At the time, the
Soviet Union indicated it might be willing to accept a unified
Germany that is not neutral.
   The United States insists that a unified Germany be part of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Britain favors a somewhat
slower approach toward German reunification than the United States
and the rest of the NATO alliance.
   On Lithuania's strive for independence from the Soviet Union,
the two countries agree on the need for restraint.
   Bush and Mrs. Thatcher, who flew to Bermuda on Thursday, planned
to take time out from their discussions of global issues to
participate in Bermuda's Good Friday kite-flying celebration, a
tradition started by a Sunday school teacher seeking to explain to
his students Christ's ascent into heaven.
   A joint news conference was planned at the conclusion of the
talks.
   ``It's not a meeting to make decisions. It's a consultative
meeting,'' Fitzwater said. ``This is a meeting to stay in touch.''
   He said the president hopes to meet frequently with allied
leaders, suggesting that not enough of this had been done in the
past. Bush is scheduled to meet next week with French President
Francois Mitterrand in Florida.
   ``The United States and Britain believe that in this period of
rapid change, the cohesion and stability of the Western alliance is
most important,'' Fitzwater said. ``The United States is firmly
committed to Europe's stability and defense and to the continuing
role of NATO.''
   Many Britons say the focus on Eastern Europe and Mrs. Thatcher's
political problems at home have detracted from the special
relationship that was forged between the United States and Britain
under the Reagan administration.
   Mrs. Thatcher comes to the session with her popularity at home
at an all-time low. There were riots in London last month over the
imposition of a ``poll tax'' on the head of every household, and
consumer prices in the country have jumped by 8.1 percent. Interest
rates have climbed to 15 percent.
   A recent opinion poll found Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party
trailing the Labor Party, 54 percent to 32 percent.
   Bush and Mrs. Thatcher last met in November at the presidential
retreat at Camp David, Md.
   Bush planned to play golf Saturday before returning to
Washington.

<TEXT>
   Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir said today he is
certain his political rival Shimon Peres will not be able to form a
government and that he will succeed where Peres failed.
   The right-wing Likud's efforts to thwart a coalition led by
Peres' Labor Party picked up steam today when legislator Avraham
Sharir, who defected from Likud to Labor last week, indicated he
would return to his old party.
   Another legislator, who announced Wednesday he was quitting
Parliament to avoid following his ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel
party into a Labor coalition, withdrew his resignation today before
it took effect.
   That could mean one more vote for Peres. But even with that vote
_ and if he manages to hold on to Sharir _ he still would only have
60 votes in the 120-member Parliament, not enough to get his
coalition approved.
   Peres, who only last week boasted he had the necessary support
to head Israel's first Labor government in 13 years, appeared glum
today. ``Listen, if everything is lost, everything is lost,'' he
told Israel radio.
   Israeli media reported grumblings in the center-left Labor Party
that Peres should be replaced by the party's No. 2 man, Yitzhak
Rabin, who gained popularity among voters as a hard-line defense
minister.
   Rabin was the last holdout in Labor for continuing the party's
coalition with Likud that collapsed March 15. Labor engineered the
fall after Likud refused to accept U.S. Middle East peace proposals.
   Shamir, meanwhile, said in a newspaper interview he was
convinced that Peres would not be able to form a coalition by the
time his mandate expires April 26.
   ``I think I have a chance to form a government when I receive
the mandate,'' Shamir, now caretaker prime minister, told the
conservative daily Maariv.
   Peres was given three weeks to form a new government by
President Chaim Herzog on March 20. The term was extended by two
weeks on Wednesday after defectors from Agudat Israel robbed him of
a majority.
   If Peres does not succeed, Herzog could then turn to Shamir.
   Peres argued today that while the Likud leader may be able to
sabotage Labor's efforts, Shamir does not have enough votes for a
majority either.
   Shamir said Thursday he didn't rule out another coalition
government, but Peres said such a partnership was impossible
because of differences over peace moves.
   Labor has accused Likud of thwarting peace efforts by refusing
to accept proposals by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
to hold preliminary Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo.
   Peres' troubles began Wednesday when lawmaker Rabbi Avraham
Verdiger resigned. Fellow Agudat legislator Eliezer Mizrahi then
announced he also could not support Labor because of its readiness
to trade land for peace with the Palestinians. The defections
deprived Peres of his 61-59 majority.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet helicopter pilot who stopped radiation
spewing from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor by dropping tons of sand
and concrete will undergo a bone-marrow transplant in the United
States this month, doctors say.
   Anatoly Grishchenko, 53, made five flights in three days through
heavy ionizing radiation in a mission to entomb the reactor. He
apparently is the first Chernobyl victim to come to the United
States for medical treatment, doctors at Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center said Thursday.
   ``This is not the normal type of patient. ... We do hope to
learn some things,'' said Dr. Patrick G. Beatty, an associate
professor of medicine at the University of Washington. ``It's new
territory.''
   Grishchenko has pre-leukemia, typified by low counts of
platelets needed for clotting and of white blood cells to fight
infection and disease, he said. He will stay in Seattle for about
three months after the surgery, planned for April 27, Beatty said.
   Soviet authorities said two people died in an explosion and fire
that destroyed the atomic reactor north of Kiev April 26, 1986, and
29 more people later died of injuries.
   Dr. Margulis Yakovlyevna, a Soviet hematologist who acted as
translator for Grishchenko at a news conference, said the test
pilot ``is afraid over the treatment, but he is sure everything
will be all right by the end of the trip.''
   The name of the donor, a French woman located through bone
marrow registries in nine countries, is being withheld, said Dr.
John Hansen, clinical research director at the center.
   Hansen said the operation was not performed in the Soviet Union
because doctors there felt they lacked sufficient experience. The
Soviet Union plans to open half a dozen bone-marrow transplant
centers within the next two years and while Chernobyl is not the
sole reason, ``it's the first factor,'' she said.
   Hospital officials said the Soviet government will pay for the
operation. Bone-marrow transplants usually cost between $150,000 to
$185,000.
   Grishchenko recovered from an initial bout with radiation
sickness but was found to have pre-leukemia in September 1988.
Hansen and Beatty rated his chance of recovery at 25 percent to 75
percent.
   Grishchenko said he could see little of the plant through the
``heated air'' but could tell ``it was destroyed.''
   Despite lead plates on the Mi-28 helicopters and a lead-lined
suit he wore, Grishchenko said heat from the radiation was intense.
   No one he knew resisted orders to participate in the operation,
although ``no one in his group of pilots didn't speak of the
danger,'' the translator said. ``He knew something about the order
of danger to himself.''
   Grishchenko and a handful of others in the operation were named
heroes of the Soviet Union, a designation equivalent to the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's newly named prime minister,
Lothar de Maiziere, said he is ready to begin the process of
uniting his economically troubled nation with West Germany.
   ``I am very satisfied all the excitement of the last days and
weeks is over and we can get down to work,'' he told West German
television Thursday night.
   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said in
an interview published today that it is time for the two German
nations to prepare for unification talks with the superpowers.
   Genscher told the Cologne Express newspaper there was the
``highest measure of agreement'' between the two Germanys and that
``with such a common interest we Germans could be the architects of
an undivided Europe.''
   Genscher has called for a meeting with his newly appointed East
German counterpart, Markus Meckel, to begin laying the groundwork
for a united German position in the unity talks.
   Parliament chose de Maiziere as prime minister on Thursday and
embraced the Christian Democrat leader's sweeping plan for rapid
reunification of Germany.
   One of de Maiziere's first acts as prime minister was to ease
travel restrictions between the Germanys during the four-day Easter
holiday, which started today.
   The nation's first freely elected legislature also apologized to
Jews for Nazi atrocities and promised to pay reparations and seek
diplomatic ties with Israel.
   Israel has long demanded reparations and an East German apology
for Nazi crimes as a condition for diplomatic relations.
   By approving de Maiziere's broad coalition Cabinet, Parliament
set up a transitional government whose main task will be to
negotiate the terms of creating a single Germany.
   Before Parliament met, members of de Maiziere's coalition
Cabinet agreed that a united Germany should remain part of NATO and
that East Germany should merge its currency with West Germany's by
July 1.
   But the coalition also demanded that East Germans retain some of
their socialist benefits, such as housing and job guarantees.
   De Maiziere said reunification may not come next year, as West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said. ``It can be realistic, but
it doesn't have to be realistic,'' he said of Kohl's prediction.
   Unification talks will be held with West Germany and the four
victorious World War II allies that divided the country: the Soviet
Union, the United States, Britain and France.
   The 400-member Parliament put de Maiziere and his 24-member
Cabinet in power by a vote of 265-108, with nine abstentions.
Eighteen lawmakers were absent.
   The government replaces the Communist caretaker government that
had been running the country since East Germans overthrew the
hard-line regime of Erich Honecker in October.
   In a series of conciliatory gestures, Parliament affirmed the
legitimacy of Poland's postwar borders, which include former German
lands.
   It also apologized for East Germany's role in the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, which crushed the Prague Spring
reforms, and for the deaths of 20 million Soviets during World War
II.
   De Maiziere, a 50-year-old lawyer whose conservative coalition
finished first in the nation's first free elections March 18, rose
to power by promising Western prosperity through quick unification.
   The government's agreement on reunification contained several
compromises that could put de Maiziere at odds with Kohl, his
mentor.
   It calls for a 1-1 conversion of East German marks for West
German marks when the nations merge their currencies. West
Germany's central bank has proposed a 2-1 rate for all but small
savings accounts.

<TEXT>
   Lebanon's civil war entered its 16th year
today, and an Arab League envoy renewed efforts to settle the
conflict, which has killed 150,000 people.
   The latest stage of the war, a battle for power in Lebanon's
Christian enclave, continued with artillery and machine gun
skirmishing.
   Pope John Paul II, meanwhile, issued a new appeal for a halt to
the ``fratricidal'' fighting, saying dialogue and negotiation are
the only solution to Lebanon's conflicts.
   ``The drama of Lebanon must end ... Lebanon must live again,''
the pontiff said in a Good Friday message to Maronite Catholic
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, arrived in Beirut late
Thursday with proposals for implementing a peace pact to end the
conflict.
   The pact was worked out by Lebanese legislators under Arab
League auspices in the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif in October.
   It calls for equal distribution of political power between
Moslems and Christians.
   The plan has not been carried out, however, because it has been
rejected by renegade Gen. Michel Aoun, whose troops have been
fighting the rival Lebanese Forces militia for 73 days in a
struggle for control of the Christian enclave.
   Aoun accuses Lebanese Forces chief Samir Geagea of trying to
force implementation of the Taif accord in the 310-square-mile
enclave northeast of the capital.
   Aoun has described the accord as ``a pact of capitulation''
because it does not include a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of
Syria's 40,000 troops from Lebanon.
   Syrian soldiers have been deployed in predominantly Moslem
regions of Lebanon since Nov. 1976, in line with a peacekeeping
mandate from the 22-nation Arab League.
   Aoun's troops and Geagea's militiamen skirmished today in east
Beirut and the Christian hinterland of Kesrouan province.
   The savage intra-Christian confrontation broke out Jan. 30, and
by police count it has killed 875 people and wounded 2,369.
   Aoun's rejection of the Taif accord has prevented Syrian-backed
president Elias Hrawi, elected Nov. 24, from spreading his
authority to the Christian enclave.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Taif accord ``will not be put into effect before a settlement
to the Aoun obstacle.''
   ``Geagea has declared loyalty to President Hrawi and has called
on the legitimate government to spread its authority to his areas
of influence. Aoun is the obstacle now,'' the source added without
elaboration.
   Ibrahimi held a two-hour meeting Thursday night with Hrawi's
prime minister, Salim Hoss, in Moslem west Beirut.
   Ibrahimi told reporters later that he informed Hoss of a plan
worked out by the foreign ministers of Algeria, Morocco and Saudi
Arabia to carry out the Taif accord.
   Heads of state of the three nations were asked by an Arab summit
last May to form a special committee to work out a settlement to
the Lebanese conflict, and their effort resulted in the Taif accord.
   The national leaders then asked their foreign ministers to
prepare the plan to carry out the accord, and they reached
agreement in meetings last week in Rabat, the Moroccan capital.
   ``It's a very important report,'' Ibrahimi said without further
elaboration.

<HEAD>Prolonged Crisis Looming in Soviet Union, CIA Director Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTs 4th graf, Generally, to make Petrov's affiliation
George Washington University instead of Georgetown</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William H. Webster foresees a
``deep and prolonged'' crisis in the Soviet Union, with a
deteriorating economy and ethnic unrest accompanying President
Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms.
   U.S. specialists on the Soviet Union generally agreed with the
assessment offered by Webster in a speech in Boston on Thursday,
although some said better times may be ahead for the Soviet economy.
   ``I would say it's just one side of the story,'' said Stephen F.
Cohen, professor of politics and director of Russian studies at
Princeton University. ``It's the downside of the story. I think
there's an upside of the story, too.''
   ``Generally, there is continued decline,'' said Vladimir Petrov,
professor emeritus of international affairs at George Washington
University. ``At least people complain more. But Russians are used
to deprivation. How long their patience will last is another
matter.''
   ``Some say that maybe they are coming to a turning point with
the economy in a year or two, but who can tell?'' Petrov added.
   Eric Green, Soviet analyst with the American Committee on U.S.
Soviet Relations, said, ``I think the events in the Soviet Union
would tend to justify that they are deteriorating. The one bright
spot is that talk is now turning toward really radical economic
reforms.''
   Webster, addressing the World Affairs Council of Boston, said,
``The crisis we now see in the U.S.S.R. will likely be deep and
prolonged.''
   ``Gorbachev's reforms have undermined the Stalinist system that
he inherited and have put the Soviet Union on the road to a new
political system, but the new system that he is trying to create is
not yet ready to take the place of the old one that he has
discarded,'' the CIA chief said.
   ``Economic conditions have deteriorated. Crime is increasing.
Ethnic turmoil is escalating. And now Moscow faces perhaps its
greatest challenge _ attempts by individual states to secede from
the union.''
   Speaking of Lithuania's declaration of independence, Webster
said, ``The situation is tense, and cool heads are needed all
around.''
   Regarding the Soviet economy, he said that ``attempts to head
off consumer discontent have met with very little success.''
   ``Gorbachev has some very unhappy consumers on his hands,''
Webster said.
   Analyst Green agreed, saying, ``They perceive that the situation
is getting worse in terms of food and it is exacerbated by the fact
their wages are increasing without any increase in goods to buy.
There are some indications that this could lead to widespread
unrest.''
   As to Gorbachev's future, Petrov said, ``Obviously, concern is
major. For a while he could get away with it because everybody
realized the economy was in such a mess that no one could be held
responsible. But now that he has achieved the ultimate power, he is
the man to point at.''
   On the other hand, Petrov said, ``To challenge him you would
need somebody and something which today in my view simply is not
available.''
   Webster also said that elections in Eastern Europe ``do not
guarantee an easy transition from communism.''
   ``They will have to be accompanied by tough reforms _ reforms
that are going to bring home the hardship of unemployment, higher
prices and inflation,'' he said.
   Webster said unemployment in Poland has jumped from 55,000 in
January to more than 250,000 and is expected to reach the million
mark by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Company says Iraq Has 44 Pieces of Suspected Gun Tubing</HEAD>

   Iraq has already received 44 pieces of tubing
identical to eight sections seized as suspected parts of a gigantic
gun, the British manufacturer said today.
   ``I am sure that most people will recognize the absurdity of
suggestions being made that these pipes are in fact guns,'' said
Tony Peck, spokesman for Sheffield Forgemasters.
   He said the eight sections are random parts of a 26-section
assembly that would be 511 feet long. Press reports have described
the tubing as possibly making up a 131-foot-long gun barrel, which
would be the longest ever made.
   Iraqi officials have said the tubing, formally seized by Customs
officers on Thursday, was intended for use in a petrochemical plant.
   Customs officers seized the eight sections of forged steel
tubing on the docks at Middlesbrough after a Ministry of Defense
expert determined that it could be a weapon.
   ``There is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size. It is
definitely subject to export licensing controls,'' said Douglas
Tweddle, chief investigator for the Customs and Excise Office.
   The company said it had two contracts for 26 sections each, and
it had delivered 44 sections to the Ministry of Industry and
Minerals in Baghdad.
   ``All consignments to date have been cleared by Customs and
Excise,'' the company said.
   Peck said each contract for 26 sections would form a tube 511
feet long. The eight sections seized by Customs were random parts
of one 26-segment order, and ``do not join up in any way, shape or
form,'' he said.
   Those who claim the pipes are part of a gun, Peck said, ``may
now care to make some new calculations which hopefully will
persuade everyone how farfetched the story is.''
   Iraq claims it is the target of a smear campaign orchestrated by
Britain and Israel since last month's execution of a London-based
journalist in Baghdad.
   ``Even if we buy a box of chocolate from Britain, they will say
Iraq will use it to produce an atomic bomb,'' Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tareq Aziz told reporters on Thursday.
   The paper of the ruling Baath Party, Al-Thawra, criticized the
British government for collaborating with the U.S. administration
to reimpose its hegemony in the Arab world and to help the Israelis
to maintain their occupation of the Arab land.
   ``This flagrant hostility toward Iraq reveals that the
predecessors of the British Empire want to avenge the strikes dealt
to their empire by the Iraqi people,'' the paper said.
   The army daily, Al-Qaddissiya, said Iraq will not heed what it
called ``a systematic campaign of slander launched by the British
government'' and will continue its efforts to acquire modern
technology.
   ``Iraq, which fought for eight years in defense of its
sovereignty and existence'' in the Iran-Iraq war, ``will not
surrender even a minute part of its rights and dignity,''
Al-Qaddissiya said.
   Iraq has been the focus of international criticism for two
months over a series of incidents. The latest was President Saddam
Hussein's statement that he would use binary chemical weapons if
attacked by Israel. Chemical weapons are banned under a 1925
international agreement.
   Saddam's threats came after Iraq ignored international pleas and
hanged an Iranian-born British journalist branded by Baghdad as an
Israeli spy. They also followed accusations by the United States
and Britain that Iraq had tried to smuggle atomic bomb triggers
into the country, a charge Iraq has denied.

   A 90-year-old man who was left an orphan
in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake became unofficially the 68th
victim of last October's quake.
   John James McDonald died April 6 at Monterey Convalescent
Hospital, where he was moved after being treated for head injuries
at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City.
   McDonald was found injured in his apartment in Belmont, 25 miles
south of San Francisco, two days after the Oct. 17 earthquake.
Friends who had been unable to reach him by telephone alerted the
manager of the building where he lived.
   Shirley Wedlake, who had known McDonald more than 50 years, said
he never talked much about the 1906 earthquake which left him an
orphan at age 6.
   ``All he knew was that he was picked up by someone and taken in
and raised for a few years. He wasn't even sure that his name was
McDonald,'' she said. ``He took the name of the family that took
him in.''
   McDonald worked as a machinist and later as a security guard. He
left no survivors.

<TEXT>
   Suspected extremists from the Bodo tribe
bombed railway lines, a road and a major bridge and launched street
attacks, killing at least 25 people, authorities said today.
   It was the most violent outburst so far this year by
tribespeople fighting for a homeland in India's isolated
northeastern state of Assam. At least 43 people have died since the
beginning of the year.
   All major train traffic was halted in the state after the
bombings Thursday night and early today. The main road connecting
Assam to the rest of the country also was cut when a bomb blew up
the bridge on the National Highway. Police launched a dragnet for
the militants, but no arrests were reported.
   The violence occurred in Assam's Kokrajhar district, 80 miles
northwest of Guwahati, the state capital. The area has been the
scene of a Bodo tribe bush war against the Assam state government
for two years.
   The Bodos, who are of Mongol origin and are mostly animists,
want to carve out their own state in the hills between the
Brahmaputra River and the kingdom of Bhutan. The region is about
280 miles northeast of Calcutta.
   The area, where most of the 4 million Bodos live, covers
one-third of Assam. Tribal leaders say they need their own state
within the Indian nation to protect their ancient culture from
discrimination by the Assamese, who are mostly Hindu.
   Violence began Thursday morning when a bomb blew up a small
truck on a road outside Kokrajhar town, killing eight civilians.
Police said the target of the bomb was a police patrol that was to
pass that way in the evening.
   Suspected militants then fatally shot a woman and seriously
injured her husband outside Kokrajhar, police said. The couple
apparently supported the Plains Tribal Council of Assam, a Bodo
rival of the more radical All Bodo Students Union.
   On Thursday evening, a bomb exploded on the Northeast Frontier
Railway line near Bijni, just east of Kokrajhar, derailing three
cars of an express passenger train running into the Indian
heartland. At least three people were killed and 12 others
seriously injured, police said.
   At midnight, suspected militants blew up the main bridge over
the Manas River, also in the western part of the state.
   At about 3 a.m. today, two bomb explosions on the frontier
railway near Kokrajhar blew up another western-bound passenger
train, derailing eight cars and leaving at least 13 people dead and
more than 40 injured, police said.
   A Bodo spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
``stalling tactics'' of the central government ``may add an
unwarranted dimension to the agitation.''
   A fifth round of talks on the Bodo issue is scheduled to begin
April 18.
   About 98 percent of the Bodos follow a religion called Bathou,
which includes the worship of spirits believed to inhabit trees and
rocks. Most of the others are Christians.

   Here is the text of a statement by the official
Soviet news agency Tass admitting Soviet responsibility for the
massacre of about 4,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest during
World War II. The text was translated into English by Tass.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The need to elucidate the circumstances of the death of Polish
officers interned in September 1939 has long been raised at
meetings between representatives of the Soviet and Polish
leadership and in broad public circles.
   Historians of the two countries have conducted a careful
investigation of the Katyn tragedy, including a search for
documents.
   Just recently, Soviet archive workers and historians discovered
some documents concerning Polish servicemen who were kept in the
Kozelsk, Starobelsk and Ostashkov camps by the NKVD security police.
   It follows from these documents that in April-May 1940, 394 of
the 15,000 or so Polish officers kept in the three camps were
transferred to the Gryazovetsk camp. The larger part, however, were
``turned over to'' the NKVD administrations in the Smolensk,
Voroshilovgrad and Kalinin regions and never mentioned in NKVD
statistical accounts since.
   The discovered archival material puts direct responsibility for
the atrocities in the Katyn Forest on (secret police Chief
Lavrenti) Beria, (V.N.) Merkulov and their henchmen.
   The Soviet side, expressing profound regret over the Katyn
tragedy, declares that this tragedy is one of the gravest crimes of
Stalinism.
   Copies of the discovered documents have been passed over to the
Polish side. The search for more archival material continues.

<HEAD>King Agrees To Let Opposition Form Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Birendra today agreed to let an
opposition alliance form an interim government, a top opposition
leader said, ending five days of uncertainty following the
legalization of political parties.
   Ganesh Man Singh, leader of the centrist Nepali Congress Party,
said the new interim government will be formed by the end of next
week. He said the king made the decision during a 65-minute meeting
at the royal palace in Katmandu.
   A statement by the Nepali Congress Party at the end of the
meeting said:
   ``His Majesty approved the idea submitted by Mr. Singh that it
(formation of a new govermnment) should not be delayed any longer,
and in case His Majesty is not prepared to head the government,
permission be granted to the multiparty leader.''
   The Nepali Congress Party and its ally, a left-wing coalition
called the United Left Front, had said they would not join the
interim government unless the king or their own nominee heads it.
   Singh told reporters after the meeting that it was possible the
44-year-old king would head the government. He did not elaborate.
   But political observers have said it is unlikely the
Harvard-educated monarch will accept the post. The spokesman for
the royal palace was not available for comment today.
   On Sunday, King Birendra bowed to nationwide protests and lifted
a 29-year ban on political parties but did not explain how a new
government would be formed or what role he would play in it.
   Political parties were banned in Nepal when the democratically
elected government formed by the Nepali Congress Party was
dismissed by King Mahendra, Birendra's father.
   
   The Nepali Congress Party went underground to push for a
restoration of multiparty democracy, and the left-wing coalition
joined the campaign.
   The movement was formally launched Feb. 18 and drew support from
   academicians, professionals and peasants. It peaked with a
series of strikes and demonstrations last week.
   
   Witnesses said 200 people were killed April 6 alone when police
fired on pro-democracy protesters. The government said only 10
people were killed.
   Birendra is the heir of the Shaha dynasty that has held the
throne since the middle of the 18th century. Many Nepalis,
especially illiterate farmers who form the bulk of the country's 17
million people, view him as the reincarnation of the Hindu god
Vishnu.

<HEAD>Woman Found in Contempt for Not Wearing Bra in Court</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note Contents</NOTE>
<DATELINE>HARRISON, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman was found in contempt for not
wearing a bra during a court appearance by a judge who said the
women's attire was ``offensive.''
   ``She was improperly dressed for the courtroom because it was my
impression and several other people's impression that her breasts
were obviously showing,'' Municipal Judge Don West said.
   Melissa Thurston, 21, said she was humiliated by the judge's
action Wednesday and said her attire was not inappropriate.
   ``I was wearing a high neck sweater,'' Ms. Thurston said. ``It
wasn't see-through or anything. He had to be staring right at me.''
   Ms. Thurston was in court on a theft charge for failing to
return rented videotapes. She was found guilty, fined $300 and
sentenced to 15 days in jail, but the judge said the fine and jail
sentence would be suspended once $170 in restitution was paid.
   There was no fine or sentence for the contempt, the judge said.
   Ms. Thurston said she was jailed for five hours Wednesday on the
contempt charge, but West said she was detained until she made
restitution.
   West said state law allows him to find anyone in contempt who
``impaired respect due authority.''
   ``The court found her offensive and informed her of that,'' the
judge said. ``I've been on the bench eight years and never had a
problem like that.''
   Ms. Thurston said she never wears a bra, and put on a jacket
when asked by the judge.
   ``He told me never to come into his courtroom or any place like
that again,'' he said. ``There was a courtroom full of people _
about 50 or 60 _ I was so humiliated I didn't want to turn around.''
   Ms. Thurston appeared before West again Thursday on a charge of
failing to register a motor vehicle. She said she wore a bra and
was issued a warning on the charge.
   ``By the way,' the judge said, `she was properly attired today.''

   There were no reports of violence overnight
in this community torn by the killing of a black teen-ager by a
white police officer, police said today.
   However, one black teen-ager, Maurice Jones, predicted: ``Things
won't go back to normal, not until the cop goes on trial for
murder.''
   Thursday night's calm followed a night of violence Wenesday.
Teen-agers smashed windows and overturned cars after a peaceful
candlelight protest over Tuesday's shooting of 15-year-old Phillip
Pannell of River Edge.
   ``We had no incidents at all,'' police Capt. Walter Pinches said
today.
   A group of black students from 14 northern New Jersey colleges
planned a peaceful march through the streets of Teaneck at noon
today.
   The Union of African Student Organizations says it hopes the
event will defuse tensions and provide a positive role model of
peaceful demonstration for teen-agers in this borough of 37,000
people eight miles from New York City.
   About 1,000 people attended Wednesday night's candlelight vigil,
in which they called for a special prosecutor to investigate
Pannell's death. He died from a single gunshot wound in the back;
some of his friends disputed police reports that a gun was found on
his body.
   After the vigil, witnesses said, police pushed the crowd into
the parking lot of the police headquarters and some people were
trampled. The crowd retaliated by turning over several police cars
and throwing rocks and other debris through the windows of the
municipal building.
   Seven people, including four officers, were injured, none
seriously. Police Chief Bryan Burke said six police vehicles were
destroyed and the windows of many downtown businesses were
shattered.
   On Thursday shopkeepers on Teaneck Road, a main thoroughfare,
swept up the broken glass while teen-agers on spring break roamed
the streets.
   Gov. Jim Florio said he saw no reason to appoint a special
prosecutor because the county prosecutor is a deputy attorney
general.
   ``I am being kept informed of events there, and I will await
further investigation before determining what other action by state
officials may be required,'' Florio said.
   Franklin Wilks, an attorney for the teen-ager's family, said he
notified the borough, county and state that a lawsuit was planned.
   Thelma Pannell, Phillip's mother, said at a news conference that
the lawsuit would help keep the case open and criticized police for
their relations with blacks.
   ``They can kill all the black kids until people realize that it
could be their sons who get killed,'' she said.
   Officer Gary Spath, 29, who shot Pannell, reported to the
prosecutor's office for questioning Thursday.
   Burke said Spath, who was responding Tuesday night to an
anonymous telephone tip that a teen-ager had drawn a gun on another
youth, has been placed on medical leave.

<TEXT>
   The Katyn massacre of Polish officers has
seared the national consciousness for 50 years, and Poles received
Soviet acknowledgement of responsibility today with tears from the
memories and anger at the delay.
   ``I regret that my mother could not live until this day,'' said
Wanda Zadrozna, crying as she recalled her father's murder in the
Russian woods.
   A statement and apology by the official Soviet news agency Tass
today reversed decades of insistence that the Nazis murdered the
4,000 officers, as well as 11,000 others killed elsewhere. The
Soviets had rejected the crush of evidence by historians worldwide.
   But for Poles, for whom Katyn symbolizes a long series of Soviet
crimes against their nation, the impact was defused by the decades
it took to set the record straight.
   ``There is a great regret that it took 50 years and the wives of
those people didn't live until this day,'' Mrs. Zadrozna said.
   ``But whatever happens now, it is good that the truth will be
finally written in history,'' she added.
   A leader of an organization called the Katyn Family, bringing
together relatives of victims, expressed happiness at the
admission. ``I feel a great joy now that after so many years the
truth has been revealed,'' said Bozena Lojek, whose father-in-law
died at Katyn.
   ``I have already received dozens of telephone calls from members
of the Katyn Family. ... For us, it is a great success.''
   She said there is no statute of limitations on such a crime, so
the admission will have ``many political and economic
consequences.''
   In London, the British government welcomed Moscow's admission.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the ``terrible things'' that
Stalin did cannot be forgotten.
   ``It's good that criminals admit their crimes,'' Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa said in Gdansk. Walesa called the Soviet
admission ``an act of moral justice which has been awaited for a
long time.''
   He said there must also be ``punishment of those guilty of the
genocide,'' reparations stemming from the Soviet occupation of
eastern Poland in 1939 and free access to Soviet territory that is
``emotionally important'' for Poles.
   The Tass statement came during a three-day Soviet visit by
Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski. Jaruzelski met with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and planned to visit Katyn on
Saturday where an outdoor Mass in Polish was scheduled to honor the
victims.
   About 4,250 bodies of the officers, the cream of Poland's
intelligentsia called up from the reserves at the start of World
War II, were found in mass graves near the western Russian city of
Smolensk.
   The Soviets interned the officers at a camp in Kozielsk shortly
after the Red Army invaded Poland at the outbreak of the war. At
the time, the Soviet Union and Germany were joined in a
non-aggression pact.
   The remains of more than 10,000 other officers held at camps in
Starobielsk and Ostashkow have never been found, and word on their
fate remains as a key demand by organizations representing their
families.
   The Katyn bodies, shot in the back of the head and stacked in
layers, were found by the Nazis in April 1943 and immediately used
for propaganda purposes against the Allies.
   The Soviets maintained that the Nazis killed the officers in
1941 after they invaded the Soviet Union.
   Poland's Communist governments after the war echoed the Soviet
explanation, but most Poles and Western historians concluded that
the massacre of ``class enemies'' was committed by the Soviet
secret police on Josef Stalin's order in late April and early May
1940.
   ``We have been missing those people for so many years,'' Mrs.
Zadrozna said. ``They were not ordinary people. They were people of

   The $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope will get slightly more dusty as it awaits a new launch
date on space shuttle Discovery, but the amount of contamination is
expected to be minimal, NASA said today.
   ``We've done all the cautionary things that we can,'' said Fred
Wojtalik, a NASA project manager. ``(But) we're going to get some
degradation. Some particles are going to come into the Hubble that
we just can't avoid.''
   Scientists want no more than 5 percent of the surface of
Hubble's 94-inch mirror, the finest ever made, covered with dust or
other debris once the telescope reaches orbit, Wojtalik said.
   A 2 percent rate of contamination was expected if Discovery had
been launched on time Tuesday, Wojtalik said. That is expected to
rise to 2.1 percent _ still well within limits _ as a result of the
delay until the new launch date, April 25.
   Clean air was being circulated inside Discovery's sealed payl420.

<TEXT>
   A senior official says a recent Supreme
Court decision means Colombia will have to return most if not all
of the property seized from drug traffickers, dealing a grave blow
to the anti-drug campaign.
   Judges have already returned 33 of the 430 farms, houses and
other properties _ worth at least $23 million _ that were
confiscated by presidential decree, the official said Thursday. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Supreme Court ruling late last year overturned the
presidential decree. The official's comments indicated the
government now realizes how devastating the court's decision was.
   ``I think this may mean the war against traffickers is lost,''
he said.
   Some judges have taken bribes from alleged traffickers who want
their farms back, and ``those judges who resist will almost
certainly be killed,'' the official said.
   The government's 8-month-old war on drugs that began when the
leading presidential candidate was slain by traffickers. The
government began confiscating properties and extraditing drug
barons to the United States for trial.
   At the same time, traffickers announced a counteroffensive in
which 200 people have died. Barco's order to seize properties of
suspected traffickers was one of his main weapons in his fight
against drugs. According to his decree, a federal court was to
determine the final status of the properties.
   Owners were to present themselves before the court and prove
they had no ties to drug trafficking in order to recover their
possessions.
   However, the Supreme Court late last year shifted the burden of
proof to the administration, ruling no property can be permanently
seized unless the owner has been found guilty of a crime.
   Many of the owners are charged with crimes but have not been
found guilty. Traffickers have traditionally bribed or intimidated
Colombian judges.
   Since August, 15 people have been extradited, but authorities
have not captured many people considered leading traffickers,
including reputed Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar. That drug
cartel is considered among the leading groups smuggling cocaine
into the United States.
   ``Pablo Escobar has not yet been found guilty of any crime.
Legally he has a right to his properties,'' said the official.
   The government official accused Barco of lacking foresight in
his handling of the anti-drug campaign.
   ``Before the Supreme Court decision, I told President Barco that
we should target the 50 farms that we knew belonged to Pablo
Escobar,'' he said.
   The seized farms could provide land for 20,000 peasant families
if the state could carry out a program to redistribute the
property, he said.
   But he said such a program was virtually impossible.
   ``The only way for the government to maintain control of these
properties is through new legislation,'' he said. And any law would
have to be passed by Congress, which is controlled by drug
traffickers, the official said.
   His comments came one day after a car bomb exploded in the
cocaine trafficking center of Medellin, killing 20 people,
including eight members of an elite police anti-drug squad. Drug
traffickers have been killing police officers in Medellin in
retaliation for the crackdown on drugs.
   In Medellin, anonymous callers to local media said the cartel
had carried out Wednesday's attack in retaliation for the torture
and murders of traffickers by police.
   The government has denied the charge against the force.
   Authorities say the drug lords have offered to pay $4,300 for
each police officer killed in the city of 2 million, Colombia's
second-largest.

<HEAD>Bush Encouraged by Signs from Soviets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 8 grafs new with Bush remarks, editing to conform</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he was encouraged by
signs that the Soviet Union is eager to conclude the main elements
of a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear arms before his May summit
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   During a flight to Bermuda for a meeting with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Bush told reporters he welcomed
Gorbachev's statement to some Democratic senators in Moscow on
Thursday that he expected to initial the framework of a strategic
arms treaty at the Washington summit.
   ``He was quite upbeat there,'' the president said. ``I viewed
that as a very positive statement. We are sending the same signals
to our negotiators and policy-makers.''
   After a week of mostly downbeat comments about the outlook for
overcoming major negotiating obstacles, the Bush administration
switched to a more optimistic tone on Thursday.
   Ronald Lehman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, said in an interview with The Associated Press, ``I think
it is highly likely we will get all the major issues resolved by
the summit.''
   In remarks to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
and six other senators, Gorbachev ``stressed his determination'' to
make enough progress in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks to allow
the main provisions of a treaty to be initialed at the Washington
summit that begins May 30, Mitchell told reporters.
   The START treaty is aimed at reducing the superpowers' arsenals
of long-range nuclear weapons by up to 35 percent, and may provide
the impetus for followup negotiations to make deeper reductions.
   Lehman's prediction marked a departure from earlier comments by
other administration officials following last week's meeting
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   That session left administration officials dismayed at what they
considered a Soviet reversal on some aspects of the START talks.
The main problem, they said, was a change in the Soviet position on
including sea-launched and air-launched cruise missiles in the pact
and on provisions to guard against cheating.
   Specifically, the Soviets argued that the treaty should count
air-launched cruise missiles carried by tactical fighters as well
as heavy bombers, according to U.S. officials.
   The United States wants the rules to cover only heavy bombers,
and to count only those air-launched cruise missiles with ranges
above 600 miles. The Soviets want the range limit to be 360 miles.
   The Soviets also revived a demand they had dropped last fall
that the proposed treaty require the two sides to declare limits on
the number of sea-launched cruise missiles they would deploy.
   Administration officials have said they are willing to issue a
separate declaration specifying the maximum number of sea-launched
cruise missiles they plan to deploy, but do not want that statement
required by the strategic arms treaty.
   Lehman said he thought disagreement over cruise missiles could
be ironed out before Gorbachev's scheduled arrival May 30 for talks
with Bush.
   ``But I cannot guarantee that,'' Lehman said. ``If so, I think
we should be able to conclude a START treaty by the end of the year
or early next year.''
   Lehman declined to discuss a reported U.S. proposal to limit the
number of multiple-warhead mobile missiles on each side. He
referred to Baker's comment last week that ``there are some things
we just don't comment on, and particularly if there's some chance
that they are under consideration as part of our negotiations.''
   The issue is particularly sensitive because of uncertainty about
how the Soviets will respond and whether the matter could create a
new obstacle to a START treaty.
   One U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
predicted that the issue would not ``hang up START.''
   Despite disagreements over cruise missiles, the two sides have
reached agreement on most of the proposed 500-page treaty, U.S.
officials have said.

<HEAD>Report: Space-Borne Seeds Could Produce Toxic Tomatoes</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with chief NASA scientist on project denying

   Tomato seeds distributed to schoolchildren
were exposed to cosmic radiation during six years in space that
could produce poisonous fruit, it was reported today. But a NASA
scientist called the report ``unfounded and unreasonable.''
   ``There is no validity that this presents a hazard to school
children,'' said William H. Kinard, chief scientist for the Long
Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), which carried the seeds as one
of 57 experiments.
   An unsigned memorandum from a NASA contractor described the
danger as ``remote,'' according to the Los Angeles Times, which
obtained a copy of the memo.
   But the memo said the research director at Park Seed Co., which
gave NASA the seeds, ``seemed to favor against'' eating the
tomatoes.
   The Times said the memo was written by Nelson Ehrlich, associate
director of the aerospace education services program at Oklahoma
State University, which oversees NASA's school programs.
   ``There is a remote possibility that radiation-caused mutations
could cause the plants to produce toxic fruit,'' the memo said.
Radiation levels in space are higher than those on Earth.
   No such warning was included in written materials sent to
180,000 teachers involved in the experiment designed to give 4
million students the chance to study the effects of space exposure
on living tissue.
   Kinard, who is at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, said that
no tomatoes have been grown from the seeds, which were brought back
to Earth in January when the LDEF was retrieved from orbit by the
space shuttle Columbia.
   ``To think that from this very, very small sample we have in
space that something strange is happening is just unfounded and
unreasonable,'' he said.
   Kinard said he had been in contact with officials at the Park
company, in Greenwood, S.C., and ``there is not a report from Park
that says that. ... They are as much taken aback (at the report) as
we in NASA are.''
   Jim Alston, research director for the seed firm, did not return
telephone calls immediately.
   The Times said National Aeronautics and Space Administration
officials on Thursday admitted there was an ``infinitesimal'' risk
of poisonous tomatoes.
   They defended the decision not to warn teachers and students
about eating the tomatoes, saying they should not be eaten as part
of the experiment anyway, the newspaper said.
   The Space Exposed Experiment Developed for Students (SEEDS) was
among 57 experiments carried aboard an 11-ton satellite launched by
shuttle astronauts in April 1984. About 12.5 million seeds were
stored on board in aluminum canisters.
   The satellite laboratory was to remain in space only 10 months,
but because of delays and the Challenger explosion, it wasn't
retrieved until January, when the shuttle Columbia brought it back
to Earth.
   Frank Owens, deputy director of NASA's educational affairs
division said the two-page document obtained by the Times was ``not
an official NASA memo.''
   The memo apparently was sent by mistake about two weeks ago to
the NASA-JPL Teaching Center in suburban La Crescenta, which has
been distributing the seeds throughout Southern California.
   ``It was not meant to get out like it has gotten out,'' Ehrlich
said of the memo Thursday. ``Even though the possibility is there,
it is extremely remote. People shouldn't have fears.''
   He said the memo was meant as ``background information'' for
about 30 employees making school presentations nationwide.
   One Los Angeles participant in the experiment, the city-run
Barnsdall Art Park, dropped out after learning of the memo this
week. A special planting ceremony involving children in an
after-school educaion program had been scheduled for Wednesday, but
park officials at the last minute substituted potted seedlings for
the space-exposed tomato seeds.
   ``I just couldn't believe that these would be handed out to kids
to grow with such a potential for catastrophe,'' said Richard
Stretz, the park's educational coordinator. ``I immediately went
out during my lunch hour and bought 12 different kinds of potted
tomatoes and we planted those instead.''
   An official with the urban gardening program at the University
of California Cooperative Extension in Los Angeles also expressed
concerns.
   ``I think it is a great project, but I can't recommend it to any
more schools just for safety reasons,'' said Rachel Mabie, youth
gardening coordinator for the Common Ground Garden Program. ``Kids
will eat anything that they grow.''

<TEXT>
   A former champion raceboat driver was sentenced
today to 10 years and five months in federal prison for attempting
a dramatic helicopter escape from a federal prison.
   Benjamin ``Barry'' Kramer, 34, will serve the sentence
consecutive with a life term stemming from a drug smuggling
conviction in Illinois in 1986, said U.S. District Court James
Kehoe.
   Kramer, who also was sentenced to five years last year for
possession of a weapon by a convicted criminal, is awaiting
sentencing by a federal court judge in Fort Lauderdale on several
racketeering counts.
   He appeared in court today using a crutch because of injuries
suffered in the unsuccessful April 17, 1989, escape attempt from
the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami.
   Kramer grabbed the landing skids of the helicopter, but the
craft snagged a wire atop the prison fence and crashed, injuring
Kramer and pilot Charlie Clayton Stevens.
   Stevens and two others pleaded guilty to taking part in the
escape attempt. Another defendant was found guilty.
   Kehoe also fined Kramer $100,000. The value of confiscated
property and fines for his previous convictions total nearly $70
million.

   A 5-month-old boy in the
northeastern city of Salvador is nameless because a judge refused
to register him as ``Rambo,'' the newspaper O Globo reported Friday.
   The boy's father, Miraldo de Moura Eugenio, is a fan of the U.S.
movie character and promised to name his first son Rambo, the paper
said.
   But Judge Luiz Fernando Brito refused to register the name,
citing a Brazilian law that forbids parents to give children exotic
names that might cause them embarrassment in the future, O Globo
said.
   The paper said the boy's mother suggested that as a compromise
the boy be named Sylvester Stallone, the actor who plays Rambo. No
decision was announced, but Brazilian law also bans the
registration of foreign names.

   Women hurling rotten eggs, tomatoes,
slippers and watermelons broke up a meeting of men who claim they
are persecuted by their wives, Press Trust of India said.
   The National Indian Front against Atrocities by Wives was
meeting Thursday in the central Indian city of Nagpur.
   The group claims that men often are wrongly accused of torturing
their wives. Women's groups say the number of crimes against women
is grossly under-reported.
   According to government reports presented to Parliament
recently, nearly 1,000 women across the country were burned to
death in 1988 by husbands and in-laws demanding bigger dowries from
the brides' families. While national figures are not yet available
for 1989, 112 dowry deaths were reported in New Delhi alone last
year.
   R.P. Chugh, secretary general of the group meeting in Nagpur,
claimed that 75 percent of the charges lodged against husbands were
false, Press Trust reported.
   Another speaker, M.C. Gupta, exhorted the front's members to
unite against ``atrocities'' by their wives.
   At that point, members of women's activist groups interrupted
the meeting with loud boos and started hurling eggs, tomatoes,
watermelons and slippers, Press Trust said.
   The men fled, but the women captured Gupta and a second man and
held them for two hours while they burned the front's banners, the
news agency said.

   A team of wildlife conservationists
recruited Buddhist monks and students to help persuade a group of
villagers to stop killing dolphins for food, an American
conservationist said Friday.
   Michael Bailey, a director of Earthtrust, said he and six
colleagues from the preservation group spent the past two weeks on
Penghu island, where villagers for years have eaten dolphins.
   Bailey said in an interview that conservationists flew to
Penghu, 60 miles southwest of the main island of Taiwan, last month
when it was reported the villagers had captured 60 dolphins.
   He said the residents slaughtered some for food and kept the
rest in a pen as tourist attractions. But, Bailey said, several
dolphins died because of polluted water in the harbor. The
conservation group, based in Hawaii, helped teach the villagers how
to keep dolphins in captivity for tourists.
   He said Penghu residents welcomed Earthtrust's suggestion to
develop the island, known for its coral reefs and varied sealife,
into a tourist resort.
   Bailey said he also has encouraged Taiwan authorities to enact
legislation to ban the slaughter of dolphins.
   This week, three U.S. tuna canners, including the world's
largest, StarKist, decided not to buy or sell tuna captured along
with dolphins.
   Environmental groups predicted the move by companies selling the
StarKist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea brands will save some
of the estimated 100,000 dolphins that die annually in huge nets
used to catch schools of tuna.

   Police discovered six rings involved in the forgeries. One group

   In addition to U.S. entry visas, the groups forged entry visas

   It said the six ringleaders were among the 13 arrested.
   Since the fall of 1988, Burma has been ruled by a military junta
that brutally crushed a pro-democracy uprising. The country's
economy is shattered and employment opportunities for educated
Burmese are few.
   Rangoon has relaxed some of the regulations on travel abroad but
extensive documentation is still needed before exit permits are

   Luis Trenker, a film maker whose career
spanned five decades, died in his sleep early Friday at a hospital
in Bolzano, his family said. He was 97.
   Born in 1892 in South Tyrol of German parents, Trenker served as
a pilot in World War I before he embarked on his film career. He
made his acting debut in 1921 in Arnold Fanck's ``Marvels of Ski.''
   In the early 1930s, Trenker became a film director and writer.
His first film was ``Mountains in Flames'' in 1932. It was inspired
by his wartime experiences.
   One of Trenker's best-known works was ``Il Figlio Perduto'' (The
Lost Son) made in 1934 and set in New York.
   Before the war, Trenker was an accomplished climber, with many
first ascents to his name. Mountains were his first love and formed
the backdrop for many of his films.
   Trenker made many documentaries. He was also a prolific writer,
publishing approximately 100 novels.

   A man believed to be a military instructor for the
Basque separatist group ETA has been arrested in northern France
and faces possible extradition to Spain, authorities said Friday.
   The suspect was identified as Isidro Garalde Bedialauneta, a
Spaniard who was released in January after serving five years in a
French prison for ETA-related activities.
   He was arrested Thursday in Douai and will be held while Spain
files an extradition request, police said.
   Police in Spain said Bedialauneta has been identified as a key
ETA military instructor by Henri Parot, a Frenchman arrested
earlier this month in Spain. Parot was arrested when he tried to

wounded when it exploded, officials said Friday.
   The youths found the partially buried shell late Thursday.
Olivier Delerive, 17, was killed when he tried to pull it out of
the ground. His companion, Christophe Amblanc, 15, suffered leg
injuries and was hospitalized in Bethune, a town in northern France.

   A restaurant and several bungalows in a
tourist complex were wrecked by bombs early Friday in the latest in
a series of attacks by Corsican separatists, police said.
   Police said an anonymous caller claimed responsibility for the
attack on behalf of a wing of the Corsican National Liberation
Front. It seeks independence from France and opposes tourist
development on the Mediterranean island.
   The front has claimed responsibility for four previous attacks
on tourist facilities since November,
   Police said seven of 32 buildings at the seaside complex near
Propriano were destroyed or damaged in the attack. The complex was
unoccupied at the time, except for a caretaker. There were no
injuries, police said.

<TEXT>
   A man shot and killed one of a group of young
men who robbed him on a subway car, then fled at the next stop,
police said today.
   The thief's companions also fled when the train reached the next
subway station in the borough of Brooklyn.
   The robbery was committed late Thursday by a group of three
young men in their teens or early 20s who were among a group of
about 18 people traveling together, Transit Authority police
spokesman Al O'Leary said.
   The shooting recalled the 1984 case of Bernhard Goetz, the
subway gunman who shot four teen-agers he said were about to rob
him. Goetz was cleared of attempted murder charges, but served a
jail term for illegal gun possession.
   O'Leary said robbery victim was described as being in his late
40s or early 50s. He said the robbers ``grabbed him, lifted him up,
went through his pockets, took his wallet and threw him back on the
seat.''
   He said the group had a gun, but it was not used by the robbers.
   ``They apparently were passing it around, examining it,'' said
O'Leary.
   The assailants had a retractable razor knife, he said.
   The accosted man fired three shots, one of which hit a robber in
the chest. The robbers and the shooter bolted at the next stop.
   Police were questioning companions of the robbers as well as
independent witnesses to the shooting.
   The dead man's identity was not released pending notification of
family.
   As in the Goetz case, the robbed man was white and the accosters
were black, but police are not ascribing racial motives to the
incident, O'Leary said.
   He cautioned against comparisons to the Goetz case.
   ``The major difference is Goetz believed he was going to become
a crime victim, and in cases since, the people who reacted had
already been victimized. Very different situations in the eyes of
the law,'' he said.

   The borders opened by a revolution were
clogged by traffic Friday as West Germans celebrated their Easter
weekend by heading into suddenly fashionable East Germany.
   Protesters upset with heavy traffic blocked a Berlin-area bridge
that was the scene of many spy swaps between East and West in past
years.
   The government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, which
assumed power Thursday, eased passport checks to deal with the
holiday crush. Border guards were just glancing at the passports of
Germans, rather than opening them to verify identifications.
   Long lines of cars clogged border points, and most of the
traffic was heading from west to east. East Germany and East Berlin
in general have become tourist meccas since the October revolt
ended four decades of Communism.
   ``One hundred people have come through here at just my
counter,'' said Peter Muller, an employee at an East Berlin
currency exchange office.
   A line of eastbound bumper-to-bumper traffic stretching about 40
miles was reported near the West German city of Hannover. A snarl
of 30 miles was reported at the border crossing of Helmstedt.
   The Glienicker Bridge between West Berlin and the East German
city of Potsdam, the scene of numerous spy swaps between East and
West during the Cold War period, was blocked by about 50 protesters
for 30 minutes.
   The protesters were angry about the heavy traffic and demanded
the bridge be closed to vehicles.
   In the historic East German city of Weimar, parking downtown was
banned because of the crush, the government news service ADN said.
Downtown parking also was banned in the East German city of
Schwerin.
   Traffic was reported heavy throughout the Germanys on Friday,
the traditional start of the long Easter weekend. Most Germans had
the day off.
   Much of the traffic problems in East Germany have been
attributed to the antiquated system of roads. Some experts say it
will cost billions of dollars to upgrade them to accommodate
increased traffic from the West.
   West Germany expects to spend about $117 million this year just
to make basic repairs to the new border crossings.
   About 10,000 property-damage accidents involving West German and
East German vehicles have occurred since Jan. 1, the HUK
association of auto insurers announced this month. That compared to
an average of 4,500 for the same period in recent years.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Peace Fund will try to raise funds
worldwide for victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident
with a telethon on April 26, the fourth anniversary of the
disaster, chess master Anatoly Karpov said Friday.
   Karpov, the fund's chairman, said the 24-hour telethon will be
broadcast from Moscow on Soviet state television, which is
negotiating with American networks about the possibility of showing
it in the United States as well.
   He said preliminary agreement had been reached for broadcast in
Japan and ``great interest'' had been shown in Central Europe. A
toll-free number is being set up for people wishing to make
contributions, but no specific goal has been set, he said.
   ``The children are suffering. They need your help now. If we
can't help them, tomorrow is going to be late,'' said journalist
Marat Yegorov, first deputy chairman of the Byelorussian Peace Fund.
   Karpov and other members of the delegation spoke through a
translator.
   The telethon is being sponsored by the Soviet Peace Fund in
association with the International Childhood Leukemia Association
of Reston, Va., and Union Chernobyl U.S.A. of Anchorage, Alaska.
   There has only been one previous fund-raising telethon in the
Soviet Union, held in January by a children's welfare organization,
Karpov said.
   Dr. Leonid Kelner, executive director of the Leukemia
Association, said estimates of the number of children suffering
from leukemia as a result of the accident range from the tens of
thousands to 160,000.
   Karpov and others said the Soviet telethon would seek to raise
funds, medical equipment and food for 1.5 million persons suffering
because of high doses of radiation.
   They said the telethon would reconstruct the chain of events in
the first few days after the 1986 diaster at the Chernobyl nuclear
sation. It will take viewers into the homes of people in the
Ukraine and Byelorussia still suffering from the effects of the
radiation, they said.
   Soviet and foreign government officials, scientists, writers and
artists will participate, they said. Soviet movie star Ludmila
Gurchenka will be hostess.
   The U.S. Information Agency arranged the delegation's visit to
the United States, which also included stops at the United Nations
and the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, the scene
of an accident in 1979.

taxpayers rushing to meet the midnight Monday deadline for filing
1989 tax returns.
   The IRS said Friday that telephoned tax questions also will be
answered into the evening Monday. Numbers to call are listed in the
instructions for filling out Forms 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ.
   Taxpayers with Touch-Tone telephone service may use the IRS
Tele-Tax lines 24 hours a day. Tele-Tax is a system of
tape-recorded explanations of more than 140 specific topics,
including pensions, dependents and the child-care credit. Phone

   The IRS expects one of every five tax returns to be filed next
week _ 23 million out of 111 million due this year. Four of every
five returns have been qualifying for refunds.
   Those who wait until the final hours to file will have to wait
another eight weeks or so before receiving any refund. When a
return is filed on time, the IRS is required by law to pay interest
on any refund that is not paid within 45 days.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today admitted for the first time
that its secret police murdered 15,000 Polish officers during World
War II, including thousands in the Katyn Forest, in what it called
``one of the most horrifying Stalinist crimes.''
   The Tass news agency issued an official statement and apology as
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with Polish President
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Western historians concluded years ago that the Soviets were
responsible for killing the captive officers, many of whom were
shot in the back of the head, but Moscow's refusal to admit it was
a barrier to better Soviet-Polish relations. Jaruzelski is
scheduled to visit Katyn on Saturday.
   Until today, the Soviet Union had blamed Nazi Germany for the
Katyn massacre. The Katyn Forest, located near Smolensk southwest
of Moscow, was captured by Germany during World War II, and later
recaptured by the Red Army.
   While the Nazis invaded Poland from the west in 1939 to start
World War II, the Soviets invaded from the east. Germany and the
Soviet Union had signed a non-aggression pact that assigned them
spheres of influence in Eastern Europe.
   At the beginning of the war the Soviets captured the officers,
whom the Soviets could have considered a threat as potential future
leaders. Stalin had killed many members of his own officer corps in
the 1930s, accusing them of disloyalty.
   The Katyn massacre of the Polish officers was first disclosed in
1943 by the Nazis, who attributed it to Stalin's secret police.
More than 4,000 bodies have been found in a mass grave in the
forest. An additional 11,000 Polish officers were killed elsewhere
and their bodies have never been found.
   Records indicate that only 394 of the prisoners held at Katyn
were transferred to the Gryazovetsky prison camp, and the rest were
turned over to the NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB.
   Although the Tass statement referred specifically to Katyn, it
tied the fates of all 15,000 officers together. All of the officers
disappeared entirely from NKVD records, Tass said.
   At their meeting in the Kremlin, Gorbachev gave Jaruzelski
copies of material from Soviet archives pertaining to the Poles
imprisoned in the NKVD camps, Tass reported. It did not report any
comments the two leaders may have made about the Soviet statement
on Katyn.
   The Soviet statement said the archive material discovered
recently allowed officials now to blame Stalin's secret police
Chief Lavrenti Beria, his protege V.N. Merkulov and ``their
henchmen.''
   ``The Soviet side, expressing its deep regret in connection with
the Katyn tragedy, states that it is one of the most horrifying
Stalinist crimes,'' Tass said.
   Today's Soviet admission came one day after East Germany's new
Parliament apologized to Jews for Nazi atrocities and apologized
for the deaths of 20 million Soviets during World War II.
   In Warsaw, Poles received Soviet acknowledgement of
responsibility with renewed expressions of anger at the delay and
tears over the massacre that has seared the national consciousness
for 50 years.
   ``I regret that my mother could not live until this day,'' said
Wanda Zadrozna, crying as she recalled her father's murder in the
Russian woods.
   ``It's good that criminals admit their crimes,'' Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa said in Gdansk. He called the Soviet admission
``an act of moral justice which has been awaited for a long time.''
   He said there must also be ``punishment of those guilty of the
genocide,'' reparations stemming from the Soviet occupation of
eastern Poland in 1939 and free access to Soviet territory that is
``emotionally important'' for Poles.
   Several Soviet newspapers' reports recently have placed the
blame for the murders on the Soviet side, but until today, the
government had not admitted it.
   Viktor Filatov, editor of Voyenno-Istoricheskii Journal, said he
plans to publish archives proving that Josef Stalin's secret police
killed at least 4,500 of the 15,000 Polish prisoners, the Interfax
news agency said Thursday.
   ``The fate of the rest is yet to be established,'' he told
Interfax, the information agency of Radio Moscow.
   But, he said, ``the newly surfaced archival documents add to
mounting evidence of the repressive policy that Stalin's regime
pursued toward both Soviet and foreign citizens.''
   Filatov said he did not have the documents in hand and he did
not give a date of publication.
   On March 22, the weekly Moscow News published a two-page report
rebutting allegations that Nazi invaders mowed down Polish officers
held prisoner just south of the western Russian city of Smolensk.
   Other articles have called for the truth about Katyn, and a
special government commission was established last year to
investigate the massacre. No date has been given, however, for
release of its findings.

   President Bush today welcomed a
declaration from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that he
wants to initial a nuclear arms agreement with the United States
next month. ``We are sending the same signals to our negotiators
and policy-makers,'' Bush said.
   The president also expressed understanding for Gorbachev's
objections to ``lectures'' from Washington about Lithuania.
However, Bush said, ``I will continue to say what I think.''
   Bush made the comments as he flew to this Atlantic Ocean island
for talks with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on changes
in Eastern Europe and Bush's five-day summit with Gorbachev
beginning May 30.
   On an overcast day, Bush and Mrs. Thatcher reviewed the Bermuda
Regiment in front of the oceanside Government House before sitting
down for a closed meeting.
   Bush and Mrs. Thatcher met for just over two hours in their
morning session and, according to a statement by presidential press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater, discussed a ``full range of
international issues facing the North Atlantic Alliessional and political
leaders. It was added
when he found professional organizations lacked basic texts _ even
Roberts Rules of Order.
   _American corporations would underwrite costs of the books,
their investment to be justified by the marketing and public
relations dividends their sponsorship would deliver.
   What a great way for American companies to become known in the
new market economies of Europe, he muses, contemplating how they
might benefit from a simple notation on the rear cover _
Compliments of XYZ Company, for example.
   _Foundations, U.S. government agencies, associations and other
groups might participate as joint sponsors.
   _Title selection would be made by a board comprised of U.S.
publishers, editors, educators, librarians and government
officials. Educators and publishers in selected foreign countries
might also make suggestions.
   _Administration and development would be through a
not-for-profit organization, perhaps ``International Friendship
Books Inc.,'' that Benjamin is ready to develop and direct.
   For Benjamin, the idea isn't new. For years he has traveled the
world, and wherever he went the idea was nurtured. Earlier, he had
hoped to develop the plan for China and India, but scarcity of U.S.
products there delayed him.
   When Eastern Europe's socialist nations decided on market
economies, rather than economies dictated centrally by Communist
officials, the idea became more urgent.
   Much depends on the cooperation of U.S. companies, but Benjamin
thinks he'll get it. Why? ``First, as media, books are one of the
few games in town,'' he says. In Eastern Europe, he explains,
access to conventional advertising ``is either non-existent or
severely limited.''
   Next, he says, ``books are highly revered and respected by these
people,'' read and reread, passed on to others, and read again.
``They're never discarded.''
   It's a rare situation in which everyone seems to win. Benjamin,
a well- trophied golfer who spends many hours on the course and who
still must work at his own business, says he isn't afraid of the
added task.
   He says simply, ``I'd like to repay some of the dividends and
fulfillment my work has given me over the years.''

<HEAD>Women's Group Vows to Topple Sexism in Sumo Wrestling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Japanese women is trying to knock down a
centuries-old rule that bars members of their sex from the sumo
wrestling ring.
   Though the group argues that sexism has no place in national
sport, it is not pressing for women to actually participate in the
2,000-year-old sport with the giant male grapplers.
   Instead, the Women's Action Group simply wants to send a woman
into the ring to present its new ``Women Fans' Award.''
   But things are not that simple in this society where men still
have a stranglehold on sumo wrestling.
   ``I don't know why, it's just been that way since long, long
ago,'' said a Japan Sumo Association official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``It's always been against the rules for
women to get into the ring _ simple as that.''
   Michiyo Inobe, a member of the Women's Action Group, said her
group of 500 members, mostly women, decided against calling for the
rule's outright abolition because they were afraid public sentiment
could go against them.
   ``I think it is a kind of miniature of Japanese society in
general, but many people in Japan accept sumo as a man's world, as
a special society of its own,'' Inobe said.
   The ban on women in the ring is believed to be based on beliefs
in Shinto, Japan's native religion, that women are impure.
   ``At the very least, we are more pure than the dirt and straw
ring,'' a statement from the group said.
   The rule became an issue in December, when the chief Cabinet
secretary at the time, Mayumi Moriyama, wanted to present the Prime
Minister's Cup to the winner of the New Year's Tournament.
   Mrs. Moriyama, a member of Parliament and the first woman ever
to hold the important Cabinet post, said she would present the
government award from within the ring, not from below.
   Sumo officials refused to part with their males-only tradition,
saying the sumo ring, a raised mound of clay 14.8 feet across, is
``sacred.''
   The association also pointed out that the award was generally
presented to the winning wrestler not by the chief Cabinet
secretary but by a non-Cabinet level vice minister.
   After a flurry of media coverage, Mrs. Moriyama said she had
made her point and dropped the request.
   The affair didn't end there, though.
   At each of the six annual sumo tournaments, 25 awards are
presented, including five by foreign embassies. The women's group
decided it wanted a woman to present its new Women Fans' Award.
   ``Sumo calls itself the national sport,'' said the women's
group. ``Women make up 51 percent of this nation. A good deal of
sumo's popularity comes from the support of women.''
   Indeed, the 2,000-year-old sport has gained many female fans.
Schoolgirls are allowed to join in local competitions.
   ``It's not true that they can't change the rule because it is
part of sumo tradition,'' Inobe said. ``They have made many changes
to keep up with the times.''
   Women were not allowed to even watch sumo bouts until 1778 _ and
then only on a tournament's final day. It took another hundred
years for women to gain access to all 15 days of the tournaments.

<TEXT>
   Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, the
squeaky-clean fun couple of 1960s ``Beach Blanket'' movies, are
hitting the road to introduce another generation to their corny
world of surf and song.
   ``Frankie &amp; Annette'' embark on a first-ever concert tour with
Easter weekend appearances at Knott's Berry Farm, a down-home kind
of place known for fried chicken, boysenberry pie and a replica of
Independence Hall.
   ``There's a generation of people out there who welcome us with
open arms,'' Avalon said Friday by telephone from his Ventura
County home. ``It really is for the family. We aren't targeting the
Guns 'N Roses audience.''
   It also seems appropriate that Dick Clark, ``America's oldest
teen-ager,'' was tapped to arrange the 35-stop concert tour.
   The tour runs through Oct. 5 and includes stops in New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Maine, Florida, Wisconsin, Oregon.
   Avalon, 50, said there was a resurgence of Frankie &amp; Annette
popularity a few years back with the movie ``Back to the Beach,'' a
3-decade-later look at the beach-movie craze.
   Avalon, a father of eight who grew up in the same south
Philadelphia neighborhood as Mario Lanza, Bobby Rydell and Chubby
Checker, sings his hits ``Ginger Bread,'' ``Venus'' and ``Beauty
School Dropout.''
   Funicello, the 46-year-old former Mouseketeer who has three
children, sings ``Tall Paul'' and several duets with Avalon,
including ``Beach Party'' and ``Beach Blanket Bingo.'' Film clips
of their beach blanket movies are also shown.
   ``This is the first time for her to go out and do live concerts,
and she loves it,'' said Avalon, adding he and the former Mickey
Mouse Club star have remained close friends through the years.
   ``The most asked question is, `How come you two didn't get
married?' We tell them, `Because we're already married,''' Avalon
said of the on-screen marriage in the last beach blanket movie.
   Avalon said he and Funicello recently broke in their act at
Yakima, Wash., and ``they absoutely loved the show.''
   ``The great thing that's happened through the years is there has
never been any resentment about our image in our pictures. The
adults know us from the pictures and the kids know us from `Back to
the Beach,''' Avalon said.
   ``It's nice, really.''
   There is still more big-screen action planned for the pair. They
will team for another beach movie later this year, a spoof on
jungle pictures called ``Surfin' Safari.''
   ``Well, I'm not one of your great surfers,'' Avalon concedes
when pressed about his wave riding expertise, ``but I've been on a
board.''

   Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, one of
Florida's most popular politicians, came out of retirement to enter
the gubernatorial race and within hours was fielding questions
about his use of an anti-depressant drug.
   The Democrat resigned from the Senate in January 1989 saying he
was ``burned out'' by big-money politics and the grind of the
federal bureaucracy. He said Thursday he wanted to keep Florida
from being beaten down by the same problems and vowed to unseat
Gov. Bob Martinez with a no-frills campaign.
   Republican officials began circulating rumors about Chiles'
depression almost immediately after his announcement, and Chiles
discussed the issue with reporters from several newspapers.
   ``I've had depression and sought treatment,'' Chiles was quoted
as saying. ``I think I was depressed about what was going on in the
state. ... Now I'm going to do something about it.''
   Chiles, 60, said he has been taking the drug Prozac, the most
frequently prescribed anti-depressant, since resigning from the
Senate. He said he is just now completing his treatment with the
drug and acknowledged that his depression could become an issue in
the race.
   He did not immediately return a phone call today by The
Associated Press.
   In entering the race, Chiles said he would limit campaign
contributions to $100 even though His two Democratic opponents,
Rep. Bill Nelson and state Sen. George Stuart, have already raised
nearly $6 million between them for the Sept. 4 primary. That figure
has already been surpassed by Martinez, a Republican.
   ``I look around in this country and I hear those voices in the
countryside,'' Chiles said. ``One of those things I hear is that
money doesn't vote. People vote.''
   Chiles literally walked across the state in his first successful
senate campaign in 1970. He swept home in the 1976 and 1982
re-elections, and became chairman of the influential Senate Budget
Committee..
   His running mate will be former Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay,
who lost his bid in 1988 to capture the Senate seat vacated by
Chiles.
   Martinez, who is winding up a tumultous first term in office,
said Chiles' candidacy only boosts his re-election bid.
   ``They have some difficulty figuring out how they're going to
beat me,'' he said. ``It's just part of their struggle to figure
out how they're going to stay in power in the state of Florida when
the tide is going against them.''
   After leaving the Senate, Chiles became director of the LeRoy
Collins Center for Public Policy, a think tank at Florida State
University in Tallahassee. He resigned from that position late
Wednesday.

   A bomb exploded in a crowded city bus in
New Delhi on Friday, and one news report said 10 people were killed
and 27 wounded. Police and hospital sources confirmed only three
deaths and 24 wounded.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, but Moslem
separatists in Kashmir claimed responsibility for three similar
attacks this week.
   A senior police official said the bomb was so powerful it ripped
through the bus and badly damaged a jeep nearby.
   ``It is the work of professionals,'' said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The United News of India news agency reported 10 deaths and 27
injuries, but officials were unable to confirm the reports.
   On Wednesday, a bomb exploded in a crowded train near Bombay,
and 34 passengers were hurt.
   A Moslem militant group fighting for secession of the northern
Kashmir valley claimed responsibility for that attack. The same
group claimed responsibility for the bombings of two police
stations in New Delhi on Tuesday. At least nine policemen were
injured in Tuesday's blasts.
   The dispute over Kashmir dates back to 1947, when Indian and
Moslem Pakistan were partitioned along religious lines.
   The old princely state of Kashmir was predominantly Moslem, but
its Hindu ruler opted to join India. Today, the Kashmir region is
divided between India and Pakistan along a disputed frontier. India
and Pakistan have fought two wars over the region.
   Indian Kashmir is part of the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir. It
is the only state in India with a Moslem majority. The great
majority of India's people are Hindus.

   Under heavy security a day after religious
riots, pilgrims from around the world carted wooden crosses through
Jerusalem's Old City on Good Friday to commemorate the passion and
death of Jesus Christ.
   The traditional procession route along the Via Dolorosa, or Way
of Sorrow, was jammed with people praying and singing. The narrow
street echoed with chants in Greek, English, Spanish, Italian and
Arabic.
   Security was heavier than usual following riots in the Arab
Christian quarter of the old, walled city a day earlier.
   Among those standing with candles watching Friday's procession
was Rene Koutroulis of New York City, who was pleased to see people
from different Christian sects worshiping together.
   ``Everybody, I think, is united, and I see on their faces that
they came in good faith,'' said Ms. Koutroulis. ``Today we are
united. Tomorrow we may fight again.''
   Israeli police Thursday fired tear gas and rubber bullets to
break up demonstrations by Greek Orthodox clerics and
stone-throwing Palestinian youths protesting the establishment of a
Jewish settlement in the Christian quarter.
   A court ruling late Thursday ordered the settlers out and
appeared to cool tempers among the protesters. The settlers said
they would appeal the decision.
   On Friday, scores of police and paramilitary border troops armed
with assault rifles and tear-gas grenades patrolled the Old City.
No major incidents were reported.
   Still, pilgrims who paraded to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
the basilica that covers the tomb of Christ, were reminded of the
Holy Land's political problems.
   An Palestinian flag, hung surreptitiously overnight by Arab
activists, flew throughout Good Friday from the cross atop the
venerated church. Palestinian flags are outlawed in Israel.
   Jerusalem's Old City is divided into jealously guarded ethnic
quarters that are home to 50,000 Moslems, about 7,000 Christians
and 4,000 Jews.
   The entire area is caught up in the Israeli-Palestinian problem
since the Old City is part of the land captured by Israel from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   For most Christians, Good Friday is the most solemn of holy days
in the church calendar and the preface to one of the most joyful,
Easter Sunday.
   Lidwien van Dongen, 27, of Denhaag, the Netherlands, said she
was ``very impressed that people from all over the world come to
Jerusalem to walk the way Jesus walked.''
   Mervat Azer, a travel agent from Jersey City, N.J., said she had
not been able to anticipate the beauty of Jerusalem or the feelings
she would experience praying here.
   ``We are praying near the place where Christ was buried,'' she
said. ``Tomorrow his light will be very bright.''
   Although Thursday's violence had ended by the time of the
Christian processions, the day was not without moments of drama.
   At one point, a man whose clothes were splattered with blood and
mud ran through the crowd of pilgrims.
   It turned out to be Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren, who was being
filmed by an American crew for the movie ``Cover Up,'' about a
journalist in Israel.
   The script called for Lundgren to fall to one knee, get up and
resume his run. But an Israeli plainclothes officer, thinking
Lundgren was in trouble, rushed to his assistance.
   The scene was reshot.
   The city was especially crowded because both the Eastern
Orthodox churches and the Western Latin rite churches are
celebrating Easter Week at the same time.
   The Christian feast this year also overlaps with Ramadan, the
Moslem month of fasting, and Passover, the eight-day Jewish
commemoration of the Israelites' flight from Egypt.
   Israeli officials estimated 45,000 foreigners would visit
Jerusalem during Easter week.

   A terminally ill judge who is expected
to live less than another year is seeking re-election and vows
he'll be able to serve out the four-year term.
   Jackson County Circuit Judge Robert T. Mills, who has
asbestos-related lung cancer, said Thursday he hasn't slowed down
despite doctors' prognosis that he has only nine months to live.
   ``I ran for re-election last year and plan to serve out this
term,'' Mills said, ``and I am planning to run for re-election
again and serve out that term.''
   Mills, who is on the ballot for a June 5 primary, was re-elected
last year and has served on the bench for nearly 10 years.
   Mills is one of more than 3,000 asbestosis victims, most of them
former employees of Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, who are
suing 18 asbestos manufacturers in Mississippi courts. Asbestos was
frequently used as fireproofing and insulation; at Ingalls it was
used as structural reinforcement material.
   Ingalls is not named as a defendant in any of the suits.
   Mills claims he contracted mesothelioma after working 22 months
at Ingalls in the late 1950s and early 1960s to get money for law
school. His lawsuit, filed in December 1988 and amended last
August, seeks $20 million.
   The only cause of mesothelioma is ``exposure to asbestos fibers
from asbestos-containing insulation products and equipment,''
according to the lawsuit.

   The Bush administration is setting new
immigration rules for foreigners with AIDS who want to attend
conferences in the United States, an administration source said
today.
   But the White House will not support a move in Congress to take
AIDS off a list of diseases used to bar entry to the country, the
source said.
   The action would allow foreigners to come to the United States
to attend a conference without revealing whether they are infected
with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS,
said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Pressure has been building on the administration by AIDS
activists to remove HIV from the list of contagious diseases.
Dozens of organizations are protesting the policy by boycotting an
AIDS conference in San Francisco in June.
   Under current policy, a foreigner with HIV who wants to come to
the United States must apply for a waiver. The Justice Department
has been expediting that process for people who want to attend
conferences, including the AIDS conference in June.
   Under the new policy, which was expected to be announced on
Friday, foreigners who want to attend a U.S. conference would not
have to reveal whether they have HIV and would be allowed to enter
the country for 10 days, said the source.
   ``The person will never be asked if they have AIDS, so they
won't have to lie or be recorded some place as having HIV,'' the
source said.
   The new policy would apply only to individuals who are attending
a business, academic or scientific conference, the source said.
   ``This is our best assessment of what the best solution to the
problem is,'' the source said. ``We were looking for something that
will work and can happen.''
   Congress in 1987 put HIV on the list of contagious diseases, and
though the federal Centers for Disease Control recently recommended
that it be removed, the administration has said it lacks the
authority to do so.
   A bill introduced in Congress last week would give the
Department of Health and Human Services authority over the list,
opening the way for HHS to act on CDC's recommendation.
   But the administration is convinced the bill, introduced by Rep.
Rowland, D-Ga., would not be passed even with White House support,
said the source.

   Business inventories fell in February for the
second time in three months while sales surged in another sign that
the economy has avoided a recession, the government said Friday.
   Inventories on shelves and backlots shrank 0.4 percent, the
steepest drop since December 1986, to a seasonally adjusted $794.6
billion in February, the Commerce Department reported.
   Sales, meanwhile, rose 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$535.4 billion. It was the largest increase in seven months. All of
the strength came in manufacturing, the sector of the economy that
had been most affected by sluggishness resulting from the Federal
Reserve Board's high interest rate policy.
   In January, business sales rose 0.4 percent, enough to stay
ahead of the 0.3 percent increase in inventories.
   ``I think the economy is picking up a little steam and we'll see
a decent first half,'' said economist David Berson of the Federal
National Mortgage Association.
   He and other analysts view the combination of surging sales and
falling inventories is a sign of strength. A sharp buildup in
inventories can lead to a recession. Retailers and wholesalers with
too many goods stop ordering more. In response, factories cut
production and lay off workers.
   The February activity sharply reduced the ratio of business
inventories to sales to 1.48, down from 1.51 in January. That means
it would take 1.48 months to exhaust inventories at the February
sales pace.
   ``That suggests as much as anything that this economy has
skirted a recession,'' said economist James Annable of First
National Bank of Chicago.
   The inventory decline was steepest at retailers, where backlogs
dropped 0.9 percent. Production cutbacks by auto companies have
allowed dealers to reduce their stock of cars by 2.2 percent
despite sluggish sales.
   Wholesale inventories declined 0.2 percent while factory
backlogs edged down 0.1 percent.
   Manufacturing sales surged 3.3 percent in February, while retail
sales fell 0.3 percent and wholesale sales declined 0.1 percent.
   In an advance report earlier this week, the department said
March retail sales fell 0.6 percent.

   Fire broke out in Bombay's biggest hotel
and forced the evacuation of hundreds of guests from the high-rise,
but the blaze was put out Friday and there were no casualties,
hotel officials said.
   The blaze began late Thursday in the five-star Oberoi Towers. It
started in the basement of the 36-story hotel, which has 700 rooms.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but one hotel
staffer said it was probably due to a short circuit in the basement.
   Deputy Chief Fire Officer M.G. Sirkhot said hundreds of
firefighters extinquished the blaze Friday night.
   Authorities evacuated more than 1,000 guests from Oberoi Towers
and the adjacent Oberoi Hotel, placing them in other hotels in the
city.
   Sirkhot said firefighters contained the fire to the basement,
but smoke billowed from several floors of the building, which faces
the Arabian Sea.

   Donald Trump's new Taj Majal casino in
Atlantic City, with its minarets and huge stone elephants, has left
many here wondering _ or worrying _ what the mega-developer plans
for an encore.
   But details concerning Trump's grand design for the site of the
historic Ambassador Hotel remain by and large the sultan's secret.
   Three months ago, the New York billionaire revealed he had
become a partner in a group that bought the boarded-up hotel with
the intention of razing it and building a new project. The
development at the 24-acre site on Wilshire Boulevard would be
Trump's first in the nation's second-largest city.
   He's hinted that he may try to put up the world's tallest
building, a tower of 125 stories or more, if plans for a similarly
outsized building are thwarted in New York City.
   Such talk has worried environmentalists _ Bob Hattoy of the
Sierra Club quipped that Trump was giving the city an ``edifice
complex'' _ but it remains just talk.
   ``We haven't formally announced anything in terms of how tall or
how wide,'' said Barbara Res, the Trump Organization vice president
who is shepherding the deal.
   Whatever its shape, the $1 billion project would give Los
Angeles something it lacks _ a landmark comparable to the Eiffel
Tower or Rockefeller Center, Res said in a recent telephone
interview.
   ``We anticipate having a major shopping area, a luxury hotel _ a
very large one with a very, very large banquet and ballroom
facility, maybe on the order of 50,000 square feet _ a lot of
office space and a housing element,'' she said.
   The Ambassador was home to the Cocoanut Grove nightclub where
the rich and famous in Southern California came to play, but is
perhaps best known as the place where Robert F. Kennedy was
assassinated in 1968. The hotel, its glamour now faded, finally
closed in January 1989.
   With no specifics to react to yet, not even an artist's concept,
the potential opponents of Trump's development are left with little
to say.
   ``There's nothing on the table,'' said Jay Rounds, executive
director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a non-profit historic
preservation group. ``We don't deal in critiques of press
conferences.''
   A spokesman for Mayor Tom Bradley, reflecting the views of
several local politicians, said, ``We need to wait until we see
specifics of the project before we can discuss it in detail.''
   The scarcity of details on design or financing has prompted
speculation that Trump wanted the publicity only to gain leverage
against New York officials who have held up his plans for a
150-story tower on the Hudson River.
   ``Perhaps the fact that I go out to L.A. will change things in
New York,'' Trump told The New York Times in February. He denied
trying to play New York and Los Angeles off against each other, but
added his plans for the world's tallest building ``could go to
either place, and it will only go to one.''
   Could such a building be put up in an earthquake-prone area?
   ``There's no inherent reason why you can't build a building in
the range of 125 stories to be resistant to an earthquake,'' said
Wilford Iwan, a professor of earthquake engineering at the
California Institute of Technology.
   But Iwan added that really big structures ``tend to be quite
flexible,'' and the way such a building would sway in a quake or
strong wind could make people inside feel uncomfortable.
   Another concern is fire, especially since city fire officials
acknowledged that the 1988 inferno in the 62-story First Interstate
tower, then the state's tallest building, came perilously close to
exceeding the metropolitan area's firefighting resources.
   Among those who voice few doubts about Trump's intentions is
Jackie Goldberg, president of the city's Board of Education.
   The Los Angeles Unified School District, which is busing 4,000
Wilshire-area students at a cost of $6 million a year, wants to
take over the property as the site for a desparately needed new
high school. But the board has found itself stymied repeatedly by
the Trump organization, Goldberg said.
   ``We're involved with somebody here who is accustomed to getting
his own way, and has the funds and the lack of public scrutiny to
do it,'' Goldberg fumed.
   When school officials asked the state Allocation Board for $120
million to pay for the land, they discovered that lobbyists hired
by Trump already had persuaded members of the obscure state agency
to withhold the funds.
   The board instead ordered district officials to work out a
compromise with the billionaire developer, whose representatives
offered to find an alternate site for the school.

   Luciano Pavarotti said Friday he will make
his first performance at Moscow's Bolshoi Theater. Next month's
concert will help raise money for earthquake rebuilding in Soviet
Armenia.
   The Italian tenor said he will give the first in a series of
benefit concerts, entitled Overture for a New Europe, in the Soviet
Union.
   The concerts, organized by Italy's Emilia Romagna region, will
help pay for the construction of a $30 million hospital in Spitak,
Armenia, a town devastated by earthquakes in December 1988.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, are
expected to attend the May 3 concert at the Bolshoi, organizers
said. Pavarotti will also perform May 4 and May 6 at other Moscow
theaters and May 8 in Leningrad.
   He will be supported by the Arturo Toscanini Orchestra, pianist
Leone Magiera and flutists Giorgio Zagnoni and Andrea Griminelli.
   A spokeswoman for the Emilia Romagna region, Tina Alborese, said
Italy had so far contributed $4 million to the Armenian hospital
project. Other funds were being provided by the Finnish government
and the International Red Cross, she said.

   Cartoonist Matt Groening looked to his own
family when choosing first names for his animated TV clan ``The
Simpsons.'' But any similarity ends there.
   ``The Simpsons are relatively stupid and ugly. My family is
smart and clever _ and a little more attractive,'' Groening said in
an interview being published in US magazine's April 30 issue. ``But
I did drive my younger sisters crazy in the same way as Bart.''
   Bart, the Simpson son, is the only member of the cartoon crew
that doesn't share a name with the Groening family. The
cartoonist's parents are named Homer and Marge, and he has sisters
named Maggie and Lisa.
   In addition, Groening said his year-old son is named Homer _ and
for a very good reason.
   ``When you name an incredibly inept cartoon character after your
father, you are forced to name your firstborn child after him as
well,'' said Groening. ``Whether or not my kid will forgive me, I
don't know.''

   Tennis star Chris Evert has agreed to lend her
name to a new line of women's casual clothing at Montgomery Ward &amp;
Co., company officials said.
   Evert is the first of several celebrities the company plans to
sign for its women's wear business, chairman Bernard Brennan said
Thursday.
   Evert's line will be called ``Chrissie'' and will include casual
pants, tops and jackets that may be worn to work. It will not
contain clothing intended for tennis or any other athletic
activities, said Dan Levy, president of Ward's apparel group.
   Levy said Evert's line of clothing will be in the stores in July.
   Ward approached Evert just before her September retirement at
the U.S. Open in Forest Hills, Brennan said.
   ``Chris Evert had the most credibility of anybody we tested,''
said Brennan.

   Musician Tom Waits said that the first time
he heard a SalsaRio Doritos corn chip commercial, he could barely
believe his ears: The singer was copying Waits' gravely style
grit-for-grit.
   ``I was shocked,'' Waits testified Thursday in his trademark
infringement case against the chip maker. ``I think he studied me
closely. I heard things I do with my voice that I've never heard
anyone else do, a certain intimacy.''
   Waits said the singer, Stephen Carter, copied ``my phrasing, my
timbre, my voice, my approach.''
   ``It embarrassed me,'' Waits said. ``I had to call my friends
and tell them, `If you hear this thing, please be informed it's not
me.' I was on the phone for days. And people kept calling me.''
   Waits, 40, is suing under federal trademark laws and under a
California common law, established in a case involving Bette
Midler, that outlaws imitating a professional singer's distinctive
voice for commercial use.
   Waits' lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court against
Frito-Lay Inc. and ad agency Tracy-Locke Inc.
   Anthony Liebig, attorney for Frito-Lay and Tracy-Locke, said the
gravely, jazzy voice used by the singer in the ad was like that of
many performers, not just Waits.

   The death of his close friend Divine persuaded
director John Waters to ditch a technique he'd used in virtually
all his cult film classics.
   ``I will never have another man play a woman. Divine was
irreplaceable,'' said Waters, who cast the 300-pound actor as the
female lead in films such as ``Pink Flamingos'' and ``Hairspray.''
   ``He was almost a human animation. You can't duplicate that,''
Waters said. Waters stayed true to his word in his current film
``Cry Baby,'' which stars Johnny Depp (as a man) and Amy Locane (as
a woman).
   Divine, who died in 1988 at age 42, may be gone but he's not
forgotten, Waters says in the April 30th issue of US magazine. The
director and some friends recently visited the actor's grave in
suburban Maryland.
   ``We all went at Christmas and decorated a tree there,'' Walters
recalled. ``People left chocolate donuts there. It was great.''

   The surprising success of her hit single
``Luka'' left singer-songwriter Suzanne Vega feeling more isolated
than inspired.
   Her song about an abused child netted Vega three 1988 Grammy
nominations, and she went on a yearlong world tour in support of
her ``Solitude Standing'' LP.
   But she says it took her almost another year to begin writing
again; her follow-up album, ``Days of Open Hand,'' was just
released.
   ``I didn't want to hear any music, I didn't want to write
anything,'' Vega told Entertainment Weekly in an interview
published in its April 20 issue. ``I felt I had nothing to say
except, `I'm really tired. I'd like to go home, please.'''
   Vega says she's confident about the quality of her new album,
although she's not sure how her fans will respond.
   ``Some people always want you to be more political, or they want
you to be more extreme,'' she said. ``Some people want you to have
more choruses that you can sing along to. They want you to write
happier songs. ... I feel I can just work on my own path.''

flying a kite on Good Friday.
   The leaders were in good cheer as they greeted a group of 20
children on the grounds of Government House, where the two were
holding a day of talks.
   The president and the prime minister took the strings of kites
that already were aloft in 30 mph winds. Bush maneuvered his with a
pumping motion; Mrs. Thatcher used a gentler easing of the string.
   One of the children, 10-year-old Matthew Figueiredo, said Bush
told the youngsters that he kept a couple of Chinese kites at the
White House and that, ``if it were a bit calmer, it would be
perfect for flying kites.''
   The tradition of Good Friday kite flying was started by a Sunday
school teacher seeking to explain to his students Christ's
ascension into heaven.
   En route to Bermuda, Bush had told reporters that he has a
``large inventory of kites.''
   ``I'm often told to go fly my kite,'' he said.

<HEAD>Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Faces Age Discrimination Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The musicians union and two members of the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra have filed age discrimination complaints
against the ensemble.
   The American Federation of Musicians' complaint filed with the
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims music director
Yoel Levi has made it clear he wants younger musicians ``so he can
mold or shape them.''
   The union and violinist Benjamin Picone, 66, and principal harp
player Judith Beattie Ryan, 42, filed their complaints April 6.
   Levi, 39, who joined the orchestra in September 1988, was out of
town and could not be reached for comment. ASO Executive Director
J. Thomas Bacchetti declined comment, saying that the orchestra had
not been served with complaint papers.
   Ms. Ryan, a member of the orchestra since 1969, and Picone, a
member since 1959, were notified earlier this year that they would
not be rehired after 1991.
   Ms. Ryan and Picone want to hold onto their jobs and force the
orchestra to pay their attorney fees.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary
are scheduled for trial June 18 on federal criminal charges
stemming from the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   The trial date was set in an order filed Wednesday in U.S.
District Court in Anchorage. Exxon and Exxon Shipping Co. pleaded
innocent to the charges at separate arraignment proceedings Monday.
   A federal grand jury handed up an indictment Feb. 27 charging
the companies with two felonies for allowing the Exxon Valdez to be
operated by incompetent crew members.
   They also charged the oil giant with three misdemeanors,
including violating the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird
Treaty.
   Thousands of birds, fish and other wildlife died in the
aftermath of the nearly 11 million-gallon spill, the nation's
largest, on March 24, 1989. More than 160 lawsuits are pending
against Exxon by the state, environmentalists and private
individuals for unspecified damages.
   The skipper of the Exxon Valdez, Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, was
convicted last month of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge
of oil into state waters but was acquitted of more serious charges.

   Roughly a quarter of a billion ``peeps''
and ``bunnies,'' those ubiquitous Easter marshmallow treats, will
be tucked in countless Easter baskets Sunday, and many will go
stale _ on purpose.
   ``We make one for every man, woman and child in the country,''
said David Shaffer, vice president of Just Born Inc., a company
fueled by sugar and nostalgia.
   The bunnies and chicks, called ``peeps'' by the company, have
been around since 1953, so baby boomers are instinctively filling
their children's baskets with the yellow, pink and white
confections, he said.
   ``I think nostalgia pretty much sums it up,'' Shaffer said
Thursday. ``It's kind of odd, I never thought of it that way. But
we've had a product that's been around so long that it brings back
childhood memories.''
   There is considerable debate over proper peep eating.
   Most people, Shaffer concedes, like them stale.
   ``It's kind of ironic because we go to a great deal of expense
to keep them fresh,'' he said.
   Achieving that certain level of staleness is an art, he said.
   ``There's the slow process, where they'll tear the cellophane
and leave them out, and they'll dry out and shrivel up.
   ``Others who can't wait that long and can't stand to see them
die a slow death do the flash-freeze approach by putting them in a
frost-free freezer. A frost-free freezer sucks the moisture out,
and they'll do it to a peep in no time flat.''
   Shaffer's preference? ``I personally don't care for fresh
marshmallow,'' he said. ``I don't like them stale, but a little
firm.''

   He's a cute little critter. Walks on a
leash, is housebroken and obeys commands to ``sit,'' ``come,'' and
``stay.'' Some say his kind makes a better household pet than a dog.
   But if the Costa family doesn't get rid of Sir Humphrey Swine,
they may be forced to move out of their mobile home in this town 15
miles northwest of Orlando.
   Humphrey is a Vietnamese potbellied pig, a breed that has become
a pet fad in some parts of the country.
   Suzanne Costa, who paid $700 for the 15-pound porker, says
Humphrey doesn't bite or dig through trash as many dogs do. Adults
weigh 50 to 150 pounds.
   ``He's part of the family,'' said Mrs. Costa, 24. ``I'll be
heartbroken if we lose him.''
   But Manager Gary Cottle of Rock Springs Mobile Home Park told
her that having a pig violates Orange County code enforcement laws.
County officials say pigs belong on farms, no matter how cute and
smart they may be.
   Anyone found guilty of keeping a pig in a non-agricultural area
could be fined $250 a day, said Joanne McMurray, assistant zoning
director for the county.
   Mrs. Costa, her husband, Joe, and their two daughters say there
are worse pets than a little pig.
   ``If the guy next door wanted to keep rattlesnakes, it's OK,''
Mrs. Costa said. ``Imagine if they got loose. Humphrey wouldn't
hurt anyone.''
   In suburban Miami, Broward County commissioners have
reclassified the potbellied pig as an exotic pet.
   ``I think these are the kinds of pets that neighbors would
rather see than pit bulls, especially in urban areas,'' said
Commissioner Nicki Grossman. ``We're pet-friendly down here.''

<HEAD>Grateful Dead Banned in Bay Area Because of Troublesome Fans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Grateful Dead, a San Francisco Bay
area institution since the late '60s, has been banned from the
University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University.
   Both bay-area schools have told the band it is no longer welcome
to perform its annual concerts on their campuses because of
troublesome ``Deadhead'' fans, some of whom who like to camp out
and use drugs while awaiting concerts.
   UC Berkeley police Lt. Pat Carroll said 30 to 50 arrests are
made each summer when the Dead does its three-concert stand. Most
arrests are drug-related, Carroll said.
   At Stanford, police said they arrest about the same number of
people and could arrest many more if they had the manpower.
   One UC Berkeley official said the problem is that ``Deadheads,''
fans who follow the band to their shows across the country, come
early and stay late.
   ``They tend to come and camp for a week in the grove of trees
outside Frost,'' the Stanford amphitheater, said Stanford Associate
Dean of Students Michael L. Jackson. ``And they stay for days
afterward.''
   Band spokesman Dennis McNally expressed disappointment about the
decisions, saying the group has worked to discourage the
``bazaar-like atmosphere'' that develops outside the concerts.
   He said the band is trying to halt sales of anything outside its
concerts, and discourages camping.
   The Grateful Dead has been around since 1967, gaining attention
as a ``hippie band'' that gave free concerts in Golden Gate Park.
   But it was the 1985 ``In the Dark'' album that became the Dead's
most successful to date, producing the band's first No. 1 hit,
``Touch of Gray,'' with its repeated lyric line, ``We shall
survive.''
   David Gans, an Oakland author and Dead expert, said ``In the
Dark'' attracted a huge new generation of fans.
   He said banning the Dead from UC Berkeley's Greek Theatre and
Stanford's Frost Amphitheater ``shows how our society has changed.
Obviously, there is a drug scene. This is what the local
constabulary has seized upon.''
   ``I know of grandmothers who are fans. I know multigenerational
families from San Leandro who love the Dead,'' Gans said.

   A man sought for questioning in
connection with a bombing that gutted a U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration office pleaded innocent Friday to cocaine charges
and was ordered held without bond.
   Jeffrey Alan Matthews, 23, formerly known as Jeffrey Ciganek,
entered the plea to federal charges of conspiracy and possession
with intent to deliver cocaine.
   The charges stemmed from indictments issued against Matthews,
his brother John Lewis Ciganek and two others two days before the
March 17 bomb blast and fire destroyed the Fort Myers DEA office.
   No charges have been filed in the bombing itself. No one was
injured but damage was estimated at $4 million.
   U.S. Magistrate George T. Schwartz ordered Matthews held without
bond after federal prosecutor Russ Stoddard noted Matthews had been
a fugitive for 25 days before his arrest Monday in Orlando.
   Stoddard also read from a transcript of a telephone conversation
Matthews reportedly had with a government informant the night
before the bombing.
   In that conversation the informant reportedly told Matthews he
wasn't going to testify against him but asked what would happen if
he did. Matthews replied, ``You talk and you're history,'' the
prosecutor said.
   Defense attorney Robert Hill did not challenge the government's
argument that Matthews should stay behind bars but said he has been
denied phone cals with his attorney and other privileges.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo made almost $301,000 in
1989, more than half from speaking fees, and paid more than $92,000
in taxes, a review of his state and federal tax returns showed
Friday.
   As governor, Cuomo was paid $127,244 last year. His salary is
$130,000 a year but he was paid slightly less because of state
payroll scheduling and tax deferring.
   He was paid $151,150 for speaking engagements across the country
last year, minus $3,000 for expenses for a net of $148,150.
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential
contender, also made $25,426 in interest, dividends and taxable tax
refunds.
   The governor paid $63,572 in federal taxes and $28,549 in state
taxes, according to the joint returns filed by him and his wife,
Matilda. That amounts to slightly under 31 percent of their gross
income for the year.
   The Cuomos are eligible to receive refunds of $3,852 from the
federal government and $374 from the state. They are having that
money applied to their estimated taxes for 1990; Cuomo pays
estimated taxes because of his outside income.
   In addition to paying taxes, Cuomo returns $30,000 of his salary
to the state, representing a raise the legislature passed despite
his opposition.

   An animal rights group, pegging its protest to

   Volunteers from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
clad in hooded black robes representing the ``grim reapers'' of

in a satin coffin and shouted, ``Have a cruelty-free holiday!''
   The 20 PETA protesters marched outside the headquarters of the

Washington, but police did not allow them to enter the building.
   ``Consumers don't realize that 530,000 cute, cuddly rabbits ...
our symbol of Easter ... are abused by industry, especially
cosmetics industries, every year,'' said Kathy Snow Guillermo,
PETA's Compassion Campaign director.
   Irene Malbin, a CTFA spokeswoman, said her organization believes
PETA is missing the point.
   ``We put human health and safety before anything else,'' she
said in a telephone interview. ``We don't believe our children

<HEAD>US Welcomes Iraqi Offer to Destroy Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

   The State Department said Friday it welcomes
an offer by Iraq to destroy chemical weapons but does not believe
the destruction should be part of a deal under which Israel would
destroy its chemical and nuclear arms.
   ``We have made clear that we oppose linking the elimination of
chemical weapons systems to other issues or weapons systems,'' said
Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman.
   ``That said, we would of course welcome any offer to destroy
chemical weapons,'' he added.
   On Thursday, Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho, said that during
conversations in the Iraqi city of Mosul, Iraq's president, Saddam
Hussein, repeated an offer to destroy his arsenal of chemical and
other non-conventional weapons if Israel agrees to eliminate
chemical and nuclear weapons.
   Boucher noted that more than 70 nations are negotiating a treaty
that would ``ban chemical weapons from the face of the earth.''
   ``Were the question of chemical weapons to be linked to other
issues, we think it would only delay the conclusion of this very
important treaty,'' Boucher said.
   ``As far as nuclear weapons go, we have consistently urged all
countries to join the non-proliferation treaty and abide by its
provisions and safeguards,'' Boucher said.

<HEAD>Japanese Peruvian Promises to Bring Discipline to Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alberto Fujimori, a soft-spoken agricultural
engineer who enjoys growing rosebushes in his backyard, has
suddenly become the man most likely to take the helm of Peru, one
of Latin America's most ungovernable nations.
   The 51-year-old Japanese Peruvian came out of nowhere in
Sunday's presidential election to rob a majority from novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa and force him into a runoff.
   Pollsters say the centrist independent's popularity is growing
daily as Vargas Llosa's support declines. With the likely support
of leftist parties in a June runoff, Fujimori appears unbeatable.
   The Lima press dubbed his rise the ``Fujimori phenomenon.''
Headlines told of Vargas Llosa getting swept away by a ``tsunami,''
a tidal wave of ``Fujimania.''
   ``Imagine the inability of these political parties to manage an
electoral campaign. It makes me laugh that they've come out looking
so ridiculous,'' Fujimori said in an interview with The Associated
Press, one of his first since the election.
   He compared his campaign strategy to the martial arts. ``You
take advantage of the forces of the other, boom boom, wherever they
lead,'' he said, slicing his hand through an imaginary brick.
   Vargas Llosa, also an independent, and his right-of-center
Democratic Front coalition spent more than $3.6 million on his
campaign, according to the respected news magazine Caretas.
   Fujimori, who sold a house, his car and a tractor to raise
campaign funds, spent about $180,000.
   He claims to be the only candidate truly independent of
``professional politicians.'' But he has shown political skill,
which some say he honed during his years as a university rector in
a country where universities are highly politicized.
   In the early days of his campaign, he posed for photographers
dressed as a samurai warrior and a karate expert. He said it was
necessary to get attention.
   Within days after Sunday's vote, Vargas Llosa was meeting with
advisers and pondering his political future at a friend's beach
home south of Lima. He reportedly considered dropping out of the
race.
   Fujimori, meanwhile, was attending to the pack of reporters
camped in front of his middle-class Lima home, posing for pictures
with some Chinese squash and handing out flowers from his garden.
   Fujimori has avoided specifics throughout his six-month
campaign, speaking instead of broad social goals like improved
health care and revitalizing industry.
   Analysts say Fujimori's success was due to voters' alarm over
Vargas Llosa's explicit plan for drastic austerity measures and
their wariness of the old-time politicians in the Democratic Front.
   Fujimori is one of five children and the oldest son of Japanese
immigrants who came to Peru in 1934 from the city of Kumamoto on
the southern Japanese island of Kyushu.
   His father worked at various jobs, including an upholstery shop
he opened in downtown Lima. The family lost the business during a
boycott of Japanese businesses during World War II.
   Fujimori earned a degree in agricultural engineering from the
National Agrarian University in 1960, and later served as the
school's rector from 1984 to 1989. He has studied in France,
Belgium and the United States. He speaks Spanish, Japanese,
English, French and German.
   Though his parents were Buddhists, Fujimori grew up a Catholic
in this overwhelmingly Catholic country.
   He doesn't mind if people view him as smart, honest and
hard-working because he is Japanese. But he says he's ``100 percent
Peruvian,'' and has only an ``ancestral connection'' to Japan.
   He describes himself as studious, introverted, without any
``common vices,'' and says working is his hobby. He works 12 to 13
hours a day and refuses to eat or drink anything between meals. ``I
don't want to be distracted,'' he said.
   Usually dressed in a three-piece suit, Fujimori appears stiff
and serious when he meets with the public, but voters have warmed
to him and his promises of discipline and hard work.
   He says his political movement, called simply Change 90, is an
``expression of people who are tired of the old, corrupt political
parties and who just want to work.''
   Fujimori has support in Peru's growing evangelical community,
whose leaders see in him the simple, honest president the country
needs. One of his two vice-presidential candidates is Carlos
Garcia, a Baptist pastor. The other is Maximo San Roman, a bread
factory owner who has perfected ways of making bread from carrots
and sweet potatoes.

<HEAD>Nepal's King Would Allow Opposition to Lead Interim Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Birendra has agreed to let an
opposition alliance head an interim government, a leader of the
7-week-old pro-democracy movement reported Friday.
   A separate opposition statement said it was willing to allow the
king himself to head the government, but it would step in if he
chose not to. The king, who has generally stayed above the daily
management of the government, was believed unlikely to assume its
leadership.
   The political uncertainty stems from Birendra's proclamation
five days ago, after popular demonstrations, that he would lift the
29-year-old ban on political parties. Birendra then invited the
Nepali Congress Party and United Left Front, which together led the
pro-democracy movement, to join the interim government.
   On Friday, after a 65-minute meeting with the king at the Royal
palace in Katmandu, Nepali Congress leader Ganesh Man Singh said
the 44-year-old monarch was ready to allow the opposition to lead
an interim government until elections can be held.
   The meeting was the first between Birendra and the 75-year-old
Singh since the pro-democracy movement burgeoned in February.
   The government of this Himalayan kingdom first reacted to the
pro-democracy campaign with a bloody crackdown. Witnesses said 200
people were killed when security forces fired on a crowd of 200,000
marching to the palace April 6. The government said 10 people were
killed and 107 that day.
   Singh was invited to the palace Friday after the Nepali Congress
Party and the seven-party United Left Front set nine conditions for
joining the interim government.
   The conditions included an assurance that the new government
would not be headed by a member of the non-partisan national
assembly, the Rashtriya Panchayat, which is dominated by loyalist
legislators.
   Calling the king the ``lesser of the two evils,'' the Nepali
Congress said it was willing to allow the king to head the council
of ministers until general elections can be held.
   A statement issued by the Nepali Congress after the palace
meeting said Birendra agreed that in case he was ``not prepared to
head the government, permission be granted to the multiparty
leaders (to form the interim government).''
   Singh said the king has also agreed to discuss the other eight
conditions, which include dismissal of the present government,
dissolution of the Rashtriya Panchayat and reforms in the
constitution. The constitution gives the king absolute legislative,
executive and judicial powers.
   ``Unless these preconditions are met, we will not form the
government,'' Nepali Congress President K.P. Bhattarai told
reporters. He said the king reacted positively to the demands.
However, he did not elaborate.
   Singh said ``by next week we will sort it out.''
   ``By the end of next week, a new government will be formed,'' he
added.
   Political observers have said that the king is unlikely to
accept the government's leadership.
   No royal spokesman was not available for comment.
   While Singh was meeting with Birendra, Foreign Minister
Pashupati Rana indicated his government would not accept an
opposition member as head of the interim administration.
   ``Our position is that the interim government has been
constituted,'' Rana told reporters, referring to the present
government of Prime Minister Lokendra Chand appointed after his
predecessor resigned April 5.

<HEAD>`Dear Gorbachev' Letter Solves Sock Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't tell 19-year-old Andrei Umrikhin that
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev does not care.
   After trying for a year and a half to buy some new socks in his
small village in southern Russia, Umrikhin sent a letter directly
to Gorbachev. A little more than a month later, the creaky Soviet
retail system coughed up new socks not only for Umrikhin and his
family, but for the whole village.
   It was not only socks that appeared in the local store.
Toothpaste and soap did, too.
   ``To tell the truth, I still wonder whether it was all a
coincidence, or whether the socks really were from the Central
Committee,'' said Umrikhin, reached by telephone in his village of
Beloye, about 280 miles south of Moscow.
   ``At first, I prayed for Gorbachev, but I don't believe in him
any more because after five years of perestroika, I had to write
him a letter to get a pair of socks,'' he added.
   ``But personally I am very grateful to him and to the whole
party apparatus for helping me out in such a predicament.''
   Sergei Borodin, the ideology chief of the Communist Party in
Umrikhin's district, said the young man is really a ``no-good
loafer.'' He said Umrikhin spent his time selling unofficial
newspapers until authorities put a stop to it, and he was trying to
get back at them.
   Umrikhin said he endured holes in his socks for months until he
was called for the spring draft.
   It occurred to him he would have to appear before young nurses
at the local clinic in his old socks, and it was more than he could
bear. He wrote to Gorbachev at the end of February.
   ``Dear Mikhail Sergeyevich, please send me and my family some
socks,'' he recalled saying in his letter. ``But because we are
rather hard pressed financially, send us cheap socks, please, if
you can. And I beg you not to think that this is some kind of
prank. I am positively serious about it.''
   Umrikhin's mother makes about 90 rubles a month, just above the
official poverty level, as a cleaning woman. He earns about the
same amount and his twin brother has a student's stipend of about
70 rubles a month.
   Their 13-year-old brother lives with them in about 20 square
yards of space _ half a rundown duplex with no modern conveniences.
   Three weeks after writing Gorbachev, Umrikhin received a
postcard saying his letter had been registered at the the General
Department of the Communist Party Central Committee in Moscow.
   Two weeks later, the district party secretary called Umrikhin
and told him to go to his local distribution center for consumer
goods.
   There, he was referred back to his local store and sold a pair
of new socks for 1.70 rubles _ about the cheapest available in the
Soviet Union.
   ``And the next day, after standing in line with other villagers
this time, I officially bought the same kind of socks for the rest
of my family,'' he said.
   His story appeared in the Kursk newspaper Young Guard under the
headline ``Socks from Gorbachev'' at the beginning of April and was
picked up by a national newspaper.
   Borodin, the local Communist Party official, said it all was
done to embarrass party leaders.
   ``It was an act of malice and revenge,'' he said. ``It was
nothing substantial to make a fuss about, just socks! Every region
any time may be struck with a temporary shortage of something or

<HEAD>Five Policemen to Stand Trial for Abuses During Peace Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five police officers will stand trial on
charges of using unnecessary force to break up a ``human chain''
peace demonstration in December, police said Friday.
   The district commander who ordered force to be used in
dispersing the protesters will be transferred from his post, police
said.
   The state prosecutor, Dorit Beinish, recommended the actions in
a report that blamed the police for aggravating the protest Dec.
30. Officers charged protesters, clubbed them and fired tear gas
and rubber bullets as they tried to link arms around Jerusalem's
walled Old City.
   More than 50 people were injured in the melee, including an
Italian tourist who lost her eye when a water cannon shattered the
glass of her hotel window.
   ``The source of escalation did not lie with the protesters, but
with the action of the police,'' Beinish wrote in the 17-page
report, according to the Ha'aretz and Davar newspapers.
   A Justice Ministry spokeswoman could not be reached for comment
because of the Passover holiday.
   According to the newspapers, the prosecutor's report also
criticized the internal police investigation of the affair for
failing to identify the officers who fired the rubber bullets,
despite news photographs and TV footage of the incident.
   ``The claim that it is impossible to identify those who opened
fire is unacceptable and therefore the investigation must be
completed,'' Beinish wrote.
   Her report also criticized the police commander on the scene for
not having first warned the protesters to leave before ordering
them dispersed by force.
   Police spokesman Roni Yeshayahu said Police Commissioner Yaakov
Turner had adopted all the state prosecutor's recommendations and
would reopen the investigation.
   He said criminal charges would be brought against three officers
accused of beating a photographer, and two other officers would be
brought before a disciplinary court on charges of using unnecessary
force.
   The state prosecutor's report resulted from appeals from peace
activists and tourists who took part in the protest and complained
of excessive use of force by police.
   The police action prompted formal complaints from the Italian
government and European Community, and the European Parliament
recommended that some cultural and technological exchange
activities between Europe and Israel be suspended.

   The slaying of a high school tennis star
who police believe may have been killed because he informed on gang
members has stunned this peaceful suburb.
   The killing of Charles Hardison, 16, was only the second in 20
years in this affluent town just south of Boston's inner city,
Milton police said.
   ``Charles had the personality that every man in the world would
like to have,'' said Jim Smith, who coached Hardison in tennis for
the past eight years. ``If you could bottle it, you could make a
million dollars. He was destined to be a leader.''
   Hardison's mother, Adlene, went to wake him Thursday morning but
found his bed had not been slept in. She found him in the basement
with four gunshot wounds, three to the head, police said. There was
no sign of a struggle, robbry or forced entry, leading
investigators to believe that Hardison knew his killer, police said.
   Mrs. Hardison had arrived home the previous night and found her
son's keys in the lock. Neighbors said he often forget to remove
his keys from the lock. Mrs. Hardison apparently assumed he'd gone
to sleep.
   Students at Milton High School, where Hardison was the
top-ranked tennis player, said the shooting may have been connected
to an incident last year in which members of a Boston gang crashed
a party given by a friend of Hardison's. The party later turned
violent.
   Hardison, reportedly angered because one of his friends was
injured, cooperated with police, pointing out the home of the
girlfriend of one alleged gang member, some students said.
   A Milton police officer said Friday that the department was
investigating the possibility of a gang link in the killing. Boston
Police Deputy Superintendent William Celester, who runs the police
station in the gang-plagued Roxbury section, said Milton police had
contacted detectives there about the killing.
   School officials said Hardison was not involved in gangs or
drugs and had never been a discipline problem.
   Student anger over Hardison's death spilled over into an
assembly Thursday, a school official said.
   At the assembly, one student denied that her boyfriend,
reportedly a gang member, had killed Hardison, said Vice Principal
Paul Dorsey.
   ``(Other students) walked out as the girl was speaking,'' he
said. ``My interpretation might have been that they didn't believe
her.''
   Eva Price, a neighbor of the Hardisons who had known Charles
since he was 5, said the youth recently had helped a neighbor clean
up his yard.
   ``I looked out my window Sunday morning and said `I don't
believe it.' He was helping him rake his leaves,'' she said
pointing to an adjacent lawn. ``He was working harder than the
guy's son.''
   Price said the killing raised concerns for the safety of her own
three teen-agers, even on a street where birdcalls are louder than
passing cars.
   ``Everybody wants to know what triggered this,'' she said. ``I
won't let my kids stay alone here, not until police tell me what
happened. It does worry us.''
   Price also said she disagreed with neighbors who declined to
talk to reporters. ``He's a wonderful kid. He died a violent death
and it should be known that he was into (good) things,'' she said.
   School officials said Hardison, who was black, helped found the
high school's Students of African Descent. He was also the
top-ranked tennis player in the Bay State League, school officials
said.
   ``He was truly an outstanding tennis player,'' Dorsey said.
   Smith said Hardison played outstanding tennis while on a
club-sponsored trip to the Soviet Union last August. Hardison won
all five of his matches, leading the team to a 32-22 win over the
Soviet teams.

   Nelson Mandela said Friday the
government is not doing enough to control police and that police
actions against peaceful demonstrators are damaging the climate for
black-white negotiations.
   Also Friday, police fired tear gas to disperse about 1,000
Moslems protesting growing drug use in their neighborhood,
witnesses said.
   The marchers included mixed-race men, women and children who
gathered at a mosque in Salt River, outside Cape Town, with
placards that read, ``We Don't Want Drugs.'' They said drug use and
drug dealing had become a pervasive problem in the area.
   Mandela, speaking in the northeastern town of Likazi, said the
government should do more to reign in police.
   ``Police look at every grievance and demonstration (by blacks)
as an act of war,'' the African National Congress leader said. He
said this has hurt the climate for formal negotiations between
blacks and whites on changing the constitution to give blacks a
share of power in South Africa.
   The ANC postponed groundbreaking talks with the government after
a police shooting last month left at least 11 protesters dead. The
discussions have been rescheduled May 2-4.
   ``I told President F.W. de Klerk at our last meeting that ... if
one white person was killed by police, white South Africa would
shout at the top of its voice,'' Mandela said. If a number of
whites ``were killed by police, there would be a mass upheaval and
the government would fall.''
   Mandela, addressing 1,500 members of the militant South African
Youth Congress, called on young blacks to be disciplined and work
to end the factional fighting that has claimed hundreds of lives
since February.
   ``If you are a member of the ANC, you will be tolerant of other
people's views,'' Mandela said. ``Those who use violence or
coercion against other political or youth movements are not
disciplined members of the ANC.''
   A visiting European Community delegation met Friday in
Johannesburg with the Pan Africanist Congress, a rival of the ANC.
   The delegation, led by Irish Foreign Minister Gerard Collins,
held separate talks Thursday with de Klerk and leaders of the
pro-apartheid Conservative Party.
   ``Our meeting with leaders from such opposing camps as the
Conservative Party and the Pan Africanist Congress is motivated by
the desire to ensure that all political groups in South Africa
realize it is their responsibility to bring about change,'' Collins
said.
   Police told organizers of the anti-drug march that they lacked
the manpower to protect the demonstrators and would have to break
up the march. The demonstrators decided to proceed, but after they
marched one block, police fired at least 12 rounds of tear gas,
witnesses said.
   The crowd quickly dispersed. Later, the marchers regrouped at
the mosque and accused several local youths on the streets of
selling drugs. There were several heated exchanges, but no injuries
or arrests were reported.

<HEAD>Four Convicted of Using Extortion to Collect Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four men, including the son of a
reputed crime family boss, were convicted Friday of using extortion
in an attempt to collect a $40,000 debt from a stockbroker who was
later slain.
   ``It was a good verdict based on the evidence,'' said the
prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin March.
   Convicted on two extortion counts were Anthony Accetturo Jr.,
24-year-old son of a reputed captain in the Lucchese crime family
of northern New Jersey; brothers Robert and Raymond Basha; and
Michael Monahan.
   The men were accused of kidnapping stockbroker Christopher James
Loiselle last fall, threatening him and assaulting him in an
attempt to collect $40,000 he had borrowed from the Bashas, who own
a jet ski business in Hollywood.
   On March 15, three days after the extortion trial was to have
begun in Tampa, Loiselle was found dead with five gunshot wounds to
the chest. U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimo then moved the trial
here because of publicity in Tampa about the death.
   Authorities said all of the defendants have passed polygraph
tests denying any knowledge of Loiselle's slaying, which remains
unsolved.
   Alaimo ordered the defendants held until sentencing, and did not
set a sentencing date. The four men, all from Hollywood, face up to
20 years in prison on each of the two counts, March said.
   Jurors, who had been deliberating since Wednesday, were unable
to reach a verdict on a racketeering conspiracy count and a charge
that the defendants used violence to further their racketeering
operations.
   Acceturro and Raymond Basha were found innocent of kidnapping
Scott Stockholm, a friend of Loiselle. The jury was unable to reach
a verdict on that count against Robert Basha and Monahan.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman will have to decide whether to
seek a new trial on the charges that were not resolved.
   Loiselle, 30, a stockbroker who was living in Largo, borrowed
the $40,000 for his struggling brokerage business.
   The Bashas loaned Loiselle the money last August at 50 percent
interest, telling him it came from organized crime and there would
be violence if he did not repay, prosecutors charged.
   Loiselle was kidnapped Sept. 27 after failing to repay,
prosecutors said. Monahan and the Basha brothers threatened him,
then took him to Accetturo, who beat him and threatened him further
before releasing him, the government said.
   Loiselle went to authorities, and arrests were made Oct. 24.
   Defense attorneys contended the Bashas, owners of R&amp;R Jet Tech
Inc. in Hollywood, were respected young businessmen who merely
wanted to get their money back from Loiselle. The defense described
Loiselle as a con man and thief who needed the $40,000 because he
had stolen money from his business.
   Peter Aiken, an attorney for Accetturo, had argued that the
government's case was an attempt to strike back at his father,
Anthony Accetturo Sr., who was acquitted in 1988 in Newark, N.J.,
following a 21-month trial on racketeering charges.

<HEAD>Negotiators Fail to Reach Agreement on Lumber Products</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade negotiators ended talks Friday without
reaching an agreement on U.S. demands that Japan remove
restrictions on imports of wood products.
   There are three areas in which Washington has been trying to
remove trade barriers, and lumber products remain the only one
unresolved.
   ``There are still significant differences in our positions,'' a
U.S. official in Tokyo told reporters.
   ``We have made substantial progress on many points, but some
issues remain to be discussed further,'' said a Foreign Ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We have concluded
our talks at this round after agreeing to hold another round of
talks in the near future.''
   The American official, who also spoke on condition he not be
named, said U.S. negotiators felt they could reach an agreement
before June 16, when Washington must decide whether to take
retaliatory action for foreign trade practices it considers unfair.
   ``I think there is momentum to resolve the negotiations,'' the
U.S. official said. ``There is strong interest in a resolution on
both sides.''
   Last year, the Bush administration designated Japanese trade in
wood products, satellites and supercomputers as areas in which U.S.
products face unfair trade practices under the ``Super 301'' clause
of the U.S. trade law.
   The two governments recently reached agreements on greater
access to Japan's satellite and supercomputer markets. Talks on
lumber trade, which began Monday, faced mounting disagreement
mainly because of Japan's complicated housing and construction
regulations, the Japanese official said.
   ``We have discussed their assertion that Japan's construction
standards are so complicated that they are hard to understand,'' he
said. ``Our position is that we can't afford to lower our safety
standards on housing.''
   U.S. industry and government officials say a Japanese law
banning the construction of three-story wooden apartments unfairly
limits wood imports.
   They also say Tokyo's product specifications and tariffs for
lumber unfairly discriminate against imports of high-value finished
and semi-finished wood products. By importing mainly raw timber,
they say, Japan is protecting its own uncompetitive, traditional
timber processing industry.
   Japanese officials say such restrictions are necessary safety
precautions in earthquake-prone Japan.
   Wooden structures are limited by law to single-family dwellings
up to three stories, and to two-story multiple family housing. Most
apartment buildings in major cities are built of steel and concrete.
   Officials from both sides said progress had been made in all
areas of discussion but declined to explain remaining disagreements.
   The U.S. official said he expected the talks to resume ``very
soon,'' but did not specify when or where the next round of
negotiations would take place.
   Last year, the United States exported $2.8 billion in wood
products to Japan, mostly unfinished logs. Industry officials
estimate that if trade barriers were eliminated, the market would
expand by $2 billion and 17,000-20,000 new U.S. jobs would be
created.

<HEAD>Competition for Students, Drop in Aid Blamed for Rise in Tuition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Competition for students and drops in
government support were the main reasons for huge tuition jumps at
private and public colleges during the 1980s, says a new study.
   And while experts predict some relief in the 1990s, they say the
price of higher education will still rise faster than inflation _
at least until the baby boom's babies start to hit college age.
   The report by Arthur Hauptman, an authority on higher education
finances, says the shrinking number of college-age youths has
played a major role tuition increases.
   ``The continued decline in this age group through the mid-1990s
suggests that college charges probably will continue to outpace
inflation for the forseeable future,'' Hauptman concludes.
   But he adds that ``it is difficult to imagine that consumers
will be unlimited in their willingness to pay steadily rising
college prices'' and suggests they will rebel at some point against
price increases that are double the inflation rate.
   From 1980 to 1987, the average boost in tuition and fees was
slightly under 10 percent annually _ nearly twice inflation.
   ``The College Tuition Spiral,'' Hauptman's report for the
College Board and American Council on Education, concluded that
cutbacks in state aid during the early 1980s were a major factor in
tuition increases at public colleges.
   Private colleges raised tuition to pay for better facilities,
services and faculty salaries in attempts to maintain their share
of a shrinking pool of potential students, the study said. The
schools also used some of the money to expand their own student aid
programs, a need provoked by cuts at the federal level.
   Furthermore, Hauptman wrote, with stagnating enrollments,
schools could no longer spread fixed costs over a growing number of
students. Plus they had to spend more to counsel and recruit
non-traditional students.
   Hauptman said an economic downturn in the next few years could
force public institutions dependent on strained state resources to
raise tuition but prompt private colleges to hold the line to keep
from discouraging prospective students.
   The trend of the 1980s was in sharp contrast to the late 1970s,
when tuitions and other charges grew more slowly than inflation.
   Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, representing 1,600 schools,
said colleges had to charge more during the 1980s to catch up with
needs that had gone unmet during the previous decade.
   ``Now there is probably going to be some leveling off and
perhaps some decrease on the average,'' Rosser said. ``But it will
still be more than the rate of inflation, because that doesn't
relate very well to our true costs.''
   Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education,
said it would be harder for lower-priced schools to cut
expenditures and keep tuition down because they are ``less
selective and pretty strained already financially.''
   But he said a combination of market resistance, the politics of
the issue and a fall-off in applications will force a general
moderation. ``A drop in applications is a powerful statement.
There's been some of that at some of the higher-priced
institutions,'' Atwell said.
   Charles Kolb, an assistant education undersecretary for
planning, said his department is taking a a comprehensive look at
college costs. He said preliminary research indicates some colleges
feel they can control many of the factors that fuel rising tuition
but declined to be more specific.
   A recent study by The Associated Press found many colleges and
universities are starting the new decade with some of the smallest
tuition increases in years.
   Stanford University raised fixed student fees by 5.25 percent in
1990-91 to $20,210, the smallest increase in 15 years and
considerably less than the 8 percent hike in the current year.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced in March its rates
for the fall will rise to $20,700, a 7.1 percent increase, slightly
less than the 7.2 percent the previous year.
   The University of Michigan and Wayne State University in Detroit
are holding increases to the lowest level in years _ 6.5 percent. A
year ago, Michigan posted a 9.6 percent increase, the AP study
found.

   Elizabeth Taylor was hospitalized this week
with a sinus infection.
   ``She has a severe sinus infection. They are just trying to
clear it up, that's all,'' Chen Sam, her New York City publicist,
said Friday.
   Miss Taylor, 58, entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on

recuperation at her Beverly Hills home, said Ms. Sam.
   Mary Schnack, information officer for the hospital, was unable
to confirm Miss Taylor was a patient at the Marina del Rey
hospital. The actress was apparently admitted under an assumed name.
   Ill health has plagued the actress for years, particularly
recurring back troubles from the filming of the 1945 movie
``National Velvet,'' when she fell off a horse.
   In 1983, Miss Taylor entered the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho

<TEXT>
   President Bush appealed to Moscow today
to back off threatened new economic sanctions against the breakaway
republic of Lithuania. ``Now is no time for escalation,'' he said.
``It is time for talk.''
   At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, the president commented on a news report that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had threatened to halt shipments of
potential export materials to Lithuania if officials there don't
halt ``anti-constitutional actions.''
   Bush stressed that he was reacting to a brief wire service
report on the development. He called the report ``deeply
disturbing,'' but said he had not had an opportunity to determine
all the facts. Thatcher concurred, saying, ``I abide by the
statement the president just made.''
   On arms control, Bush described as ``positive'' Gorbachev's
statement to a U.S. senatorial delegation in Moscow that he wants
to initial an agreement on long-range nuclear weapons with the
United States at next month's scheduled summit.
   The news conference was held after Bush and Thatcher had met for
about four hours on this British island off the coast of North
America.
   Both leaders emphasized their support for a reunified Germany
within the NATO alliance. Bush said a united Germany should have
``full control over all its territory without any new restraints''
imposed by the allies that won World War II.
   Asked about an incident earlier this week in which British
officials confiscated piping slated for shipment to Iraq, Mrs.
Thatcher said investigators still were trying to determine whether
the piping was part of a huge gun.
   ``If it were to prove to be part of a gun, it would require a
permit,'' she said.
   It was the second incident in recent weeks involving alleged
efforts to ship weaponry to the Arab country. In the earlier case,
electronic equipment that officials said could be used as nuclear
triggers was intercepted.
   ``Anything we can do to keep guns or chemicals out of the hands
of terrorisrts should be done,'' said Bush. ``I would encourage and
offer cooperation to guarantee a ban of weapons to countries that
are illegally getting them.''
   Gorbachev's threat was contained in a letter addressed to the
Lithuanian government, which declared independence on March 11. The
text of the letter, provided in English by the Soviet news agency
Tass, said shipment of ``products that are sold on external markets
for freely-convertible currency'' would be cut off from Lithuania
unless leaders there backed off recent steps toward independence.
   ``Coercion, escalation is not the way to go,'' said Bush. ``The
way to go is dialogue.''
   Asked if he planned to speak with Gorbachev by telephone, Bush
replied, ``I don't know about the telephone ... I might, I might
not. Certainly it's time to stay in close contact and we have many
ways of doing that.''
   Earlier, before he was aware of the existance of the letter,
Bush told reporters he felt sympathy for the Soviet leader's
objections to ``lectures'' from the United States about Lithuania.
But, Bush said, ``I will continue to say what I think.''
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet for a five-day summit in the United
States beginning May 30.
   Bush and Mrs. Thatcher met for just over two hours in their
morning session and, according to a statement by presidential press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater, discussed a ``full range of
international issues facing the North Atlantic Alliance.''
   ``Their warm and production conversation'' focused on German
reunification, NATO, the status on talks on troop levels in Europe,
Lithuania, Iraq's weapons and East-West trade.
   Fitzwater said the two leaders ``have mutually supportive views
on these issues. The special relationship between our two countries
was evident as they considered a strong and steady Western response
to the changes in Eastern Europe.''
   During the two-hour flight here, Bush noted that Gorbachev and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in a meeting with
seven Democratic senators from Washington, had said Thursday that
Moscow wants to initial a treaty at the summit to cut long-range
nuclear weapons.
   ``He was quite upbeat there,'' the president said. ``I viewed
that as a very positive statement. We are sending the same signals
to our negotiators and policy-makers.''
   However, high-level U.S.-Soviet talks in Washington last week
raised doubts about whether an arms agreement will be ready by the
time of the summit. Secretary of State James A. Baker III expressed
disappointment that the two sides remained at odds on a key
stumbling block: air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles.
   Acknowleding last week's problems in arms negotiations, Bush
said, ``It was our feeling that things had walked back a little bit
but now, it's encouraging.''
   In Moscow, Gorbachev also told the lawmakers he would resolve
the crisis in Lithuania by peaceful means, but without ``lectures''
or ``interference'' from Washington.
   On that point, Bush said, ``I don't view that as a hostile
comment but I view it as a reiteration of his well-known
position,'' Bush said.
   ``I can understand his position,'' he said, adding that the
Soviet Union regards Lithuania's drive for secession as an internal
problem. ``Because of history, we don't view it that way. I will
continue to say what I think.''
   The United States has never recognized the forced annexation of
Lithuania or the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia into the
Soviet Union.
   Discussing the East German legislature's resolution asking
forgiveness for Nazi atrocities, Bush said, ``I'm inclined to think
you ought to forgive, not forget ... I think forgiveness is
something I feel very strongly about.''

<TEXT>
   A man who was robbed while riding a subway train
shot and killed one of the three men who accosted him, then fled at
the next station, police said Friday.
   The robbery was committed late Thursday by three men in their
teens or early 20s who were among a group of about 18 people
traveling together, Transit Authority police spokesman Al O'Leary
said.
   The shooting bore certain similarities to the Bernhard Goetz
case of six years ago, in which Goetz shot four youths he said were
about to mug him. Like the Goetz case, the unidentified robbery
victim was white and his assailants were black.
   However, O'Leary cautioned against making comparisons. ``The
major difference is Goetz believed he was going to become a crime
victim, and in cases since, the people who reacted had already been
victimized. Very different situations in the eyes of the law,'' he
said.
   O'Leary also said police were not treating the shooting as
racially motivated.
   The trouble occurred about 11 p.m. on a No. 4 train heading from
Brooklyn to Manhattan.
   The robbers, armed with a retractable razor used for opening
boxes, approached the man, ``grabbed him, lifted him up, went
through his pockets, took his wallet and threw him back on the
seat,'' O'Leary said. ``He pulled a gun and fired three times.''
   One bullet hit one of the robbers in the chest, the spokesman
said. It was uncertain where the other bullets went. The man who
was shot was identified by the medical examiner's office as Ricky
Pickett, 25, of Brooklyn. He had been arrested five times for
robbery, according to police sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   When the train made its next stop, the shooter, believed to be
in his late 40s or early 50s, got out, as did many of the young men
traveling together, but it was not known whether they were fleeing
or chasing the man, he said.
   O'Leary said earlier reports that the robbers had a gun were
incorrect. He said although a gun had been passed around openly
among the group, the three robbers used the razor, not a gun.
   Besides the group to which the robbers belonged, there was at
least one independent witness to the shooting who was being
questioned, said Sgt. Peter Berry, spokesman for the city police.
   Roy Innis, chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, issued a
statement urging the shooter to turn himself in and pledging CORE's
resources in his defense.
   Innis advocates using force in self-defense against criminals.

   Here is the text of the news conference
held by President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher:
   Thatcher: Mr. President, ladies and gentleman, I'm very grateful
to the president for coming to Bermuda for these talks, and we've
had a very full and useful discussion lasting about four hours.
We've discussed just about everything, and I think we agree on just
about everything.
   We both attach the greatest possible importance to preserving
NATO as the heart of the West's defense and to keeping American
forces and their nuclear weapons in Europe.
   We're both clear that a united Germany should be part of NATO.
You'd be happy to see NATO play a bigger political role within the
Atlantic community, but the same time, we want to see the CSCE
developed as a forum not for defense but for wider East-West
political consultation and as a framework for drawing the East
European countries into the mainstream of Europe.
   On defense, we both believe NATO will continue to need a mix of
conventional and nuclear weapons, and they must be kept up to date.
Whether we can make further reductions in the overall number of
NATO nuclear warheads in Europe is something which will need to be
considered in NATO as a whole. With so much happening, we shall
need to consult particularly closely in NATO this year, and the
President and I agreed to keep in very close touch on that.
   We also, of course, discussed developments over Lithuania and
are very much agreed that this is a problem that must be worked out
by dialogue and discussion. We also covered a very large number of
regional issues as well as matters such as the Uruguay Round, the
EBRD, and relations between the European Community and the United
States.
   We would like to see Europe and the United States together
trading and cooperating ever more closely in an Atlantic community.
   So, very good talks conducted in a very friendly atmosphere,
with a very wide measure of agreement _ just as you would expect.
Thank you.
   Bush: Thank you, Prime Minister. And first, may I thank you and
the governor general and the premier of Bermuda for your wonderful
hospitality. It's a pleasure to be here, not least because the
prime minister and I have had this opportunity to sit down and
consult frankly and freely and openly at length about recent
developments and what the future holds for Europe.
   Naturally, we talked about the prospects of a unified Germany.
We both welcome the fulfillment of the deepest aspirations of the
German people to end their artificial separation. Both of our
governments have supported the unification of Germany for more than
40 years and we are glad that it is finally coming to pass in peace
and in freedom.
   The prime minister and I agree with Chancellor Kohl that Germany
should remain a full member of NATO, including its military
structures. And this is the view of the Federal Republic of
Germany, the entire North Atlantic Alliance, and several of the
countries in Eastern Europe as well. We believe that continued full
German membership in NATO is in the genuine security interest of
all European states.
   And in this context, we also look forward to the continued
development of the two-plus-four talks on the external aspects of
the establishment of German unity. These talks will focus on
bringing to an end the special Four Power rights and
responsibilities for Berlin and Germany as a whole. A united
Germany should have full control over all of its territory without
any new discriminatory contraints on German sovereignty.
   Now we also had a good exchange about the situation in the
Soviet Union and Lithuania. We agree that these issues must be
dealt with through dialogue so that the Lithuanian people's right
to self-determination can be realized. And just before coming here,
the last few minutes, we were handed a deeply disturbing wire
service report. Obviously there's been no time to look into this
matter.

   A paper on the history of the toilet has
earned a high school student a $4,000 scholarship, according to a
University of Evansville spokeswoman.
   The scholarship was awarded in a History Day contest at the
university.
   The paper, titled ``Down the Tubes of History,'' was written by
Michael Kula, 17, a junior at Memorial High School in Evansville.
   ``I wanted to get something that affects everybody, something
common but not like a television,'' Kula said.
   History professor Phil Ensley said the paper was well-researched
and interesting.
   ``It got the judges' attention for sure,'' Ensley said.
   The paper traced the toilet from ancient Greece to modern times.
There were at least two references in the Bible to toilets,
according to Kula. The first patent for a flush toilet was issued
in England in 1775 to Alexander Cummings, Kula said.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today warned
Lithuania that if it doesn't halt ``anti-constitutional actions''
in two days, he will stop shipments of some products to the
breakaway republic.
   The tough new threat by Gorbachev was contained in a letter
addressed to the Lithuanian government, which declared independence
on March 11.
   The letter was carried by the official Tass news agency and read
on the nightly television news program ``Vremya.''
   The letter did not specify what products would be halted. But it
said they were items the Soviet Union could export to other
countries for much-needed hard currency, such as oil, natural gas
and coal.
   The letter, also signed by Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, said
the situation in Lithuania ``tightens into an ever tighter knot,
assuming the nature of a political dead end.''
   Lithuania's leadership, it said, ``continues to adopt
legislative acts and decisions that set Lithuania in oppostition to
other republics and the Soviet Union as a whole.''
   The president's letter warned that such actions ``can no longer
be tolerated.''
   The letter mentioned as ``anti-constitutional actions'' the
Lithuanian legislature's decision to halt spring conscription into
the Soviet army; attempts by the Lithuanian authorities to seize
property of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; and an April 5
law that establishes identity cards for Lithuanians ``that
discriminates against Soviet citizens'' in the republic.
   The letter said Lithuania's Parliament should ``restore the
republic's position to that of March 10, 1990,'' the day before
independence was declared.
   In the month since Lithuania declared its independence, the
Kremlin has been alternating its tone from threatening to
conciliatory and back. Soviet troops have occupied some buildings
in the capital, Vilnius, and conscripts who refused to serve in the
Red Army were detained. Some deserters were beaten.
   On Monday, Gorbachev and his top advisory body, the Presidential
Council, said new economic and political steps would be taken to
break Lithuania's intransigent stand on independence.
   The next day, Gorbachev spokesman Arkady Maslennikov said no
economic blockade was planned. However, he implied that the Soviet
Union might start demanding world-market prices from Lithuania for
oil, gas and other raw materials the small republic needs.
   He said this would cost Lithuania $6 billion.
   On Thursday, Lithuania and the neighboring republics of Latvia
and Estonia announced that they would form a ``Baltic Market'' to
develop a common economic strategy and closer ties.
   Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 along
with Estonia and Latvia. Estonia and Latvia also have declared
their intention to seek independence but are proceeding more
cautiously than Lithuania.

<HEAD>Rival Christian Forces Clash as Civil War Enters 16th Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces skirmished with
machine guns for control of their tiny enclave Friday as the
nation's civil war entered its 16th year. The Arab League made a
new effort to settle the strife.
   Police reported no casualties on the 73rd day of fighting
between troops of Gen. Michel Aoun and militiamen of Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces for control of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave.
   The conflict, the bloodiest fighting among Christians in 15
years of civil strife, has left 875 people dead and wounded 2,369.
   Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria will ``soon provide Lebanon
with assistance to equip its armed forces and activate its
economy,'' Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi told reporters after
meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi in Moslem west Beirut.
   Leaders of the three countries make up a committee designated by
an Arab summit last May to find a settlement to Lebanon's civil
war, in which more than 150,000 people have died.
   Foreign ministers of the three states held a meeting in the
Moroccan capital of Rabat last week and discussed ways of
implementing a peace pact worked out by Lebanese legislators under
their auspices last October.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, discussed the military and economic
assistance during a one-hour meeting with Hrawi. He did not specify
if the aid would come as materiel, grants or in other forms.
   The two also discussed ``ways of eliminating difficulties
preventing implementation'' of the October accord, said a
government source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Ibrahimi, who arrived in Beirut late Thursday, said he is to
hold talks with other Lebanese government and militia leaders, but
not with Aoun, who rejected the accord altogether as a ``pact of
capitulation'' and refused to recognize Hrawi as head of state.
   The accord distributes power equally among Moslems and
Christians in this nation of 4 million, which has traditionally
been dominated by Maronite Catholics since its independence from
France in 1943.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronites, the largest Christian
community in Lebanon.
   Pope John Paul II, in a Good Friday message to Lebanese Maronite
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, called for a halt to the ``fratricidal''
fighting, stressing that ``the drama of Lebanon must end.''
   Referring to the intra-Christian showdown, the pontiff expressed
solidarity with the clergymen in Lebanon who ``have recently seen
the sons of your churches oppose each other in fratricidal combat
and witnessed the despair of those who, in order to flee the
destructive violence, abandoned their homes, their region and even
their country.''
   At least 750,000 Lebanese have emigrated since the outbreak of
the civil war in 1975, according to police.
   About 400,000 people, or 40 percent of the Christian enclave's
population, have fled to safer areas in Lebanon and neighboring
nations since the Aoun-Geagea dispute broke out Jan. 30, police say.
   Asked whether he would hold talks with Aoun, Ibrahimi told the
Moslem Voice of the Nation radio: ``I'm not aware that any such
contacts would be held.''
   Aoun is regarded by supporters of the October accord as ``the
obstacle blocking implementation of the peace plan,'' the
government source said.
   ``Geagea has declared loyalty to President Hrawi and has called
on the legitimate government to spread its authority to his areas
of influence,'' the source said. ``Aoun is the obstacle now.''

<HEAD>Space Telescope Contamination Minimal, NASA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope, NASA's most valuable payload, will be exposed to minimal
contamination inside Discovery while it awaits a second launch
attempt, the agency said Friday.
   ``We've kept this vehicle extremely clean,'' said Fred Wojtalik,
a NASA project manager.
   Slightly more dust is expected to settle on the telescope's
94-inch mirror, the finest ever made, Wojtalik said. But the
additional debris still will be well within contamination limits.
   ``We've done all the cautionary things that we can,'' he said.
``We're going to get some degradation. Some particles are going to
come into the Hubble that we just can't avoid.''
   Once the telescope reaches orbit, scientists want no more than 5
percent of the surface of Hubble's 94-inch mirror covered with dust
or other debris, Wojtalik said.
   ``We've been doing things probably more meticulously than anyone
has ever done in order to achieve that,'' he said.
   A 2 percent rate of contamination was expected had Discovery
been launched on time Tuesday, Wojtalik said. That is expected to
rise to 2.1 percent as a result of the delay until the new launch
date, April 25.
   Clean air was being circulated inside Discovery's sealed payload
bay Friday to reduce contamination of the telescope. NASA planned
to open the payload bay Saturday so the telescope's nickel-hydrogen
batteries can be removed and taken to a Kennedy Space Center
laboratory for recharging.
   A protective cover will not be placed over the telescope's
aperture door because the procedure is difficult and might result
in even more contamination or damage, Wojtalik said.
   Discovery's launch was postponed four minutes before liftoff
Tuesday when one of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units
failed. Technicians will replace the unit with a new one this
weekend.
   It will be the first time NASA has ever replaced an auxiliary
power unit at the launch pad. As a result, the space agency has
told technicians to take their time and that ``there is no schedule
pressure there.''
   ``Changing the APU is going to take what it takes,'' said John
``Tip'' Talone, a NASA administrator. ``When we get to the
changeout of the APU and get back into our normal standard
operations ... we'll feel better about the 25th, although I feel
pretty good about the 25th right now.''
   Auxiliary power units pressurize the shuttle's hydraulic system,
which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ship's
braking and steering systems.
   Recharging Hubble's batteries inside a laboratory rather than at
the launch pad will extend their lifetime, giving the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration more days to try a launch
before the next recharging is necessary, Talone said.
   Hubble is to orbit 380 miles high, studying stars and galaxies
so distant that their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14
billion years. Scientists believe the universe was created about 15
billion years ago.

   Hundreds of radical students demanding
the withdrawal of U.S. troops fought riot police with firebombs
Friday in the provincial city of Taejon, news reports said.
   The protests were fueled by rumors the U.S. Army would be moving
its South Korean headquarters from Seoul, the capital, to Taejon.
   ``Expel U.S. soldiers!'' about 1,000 students yelled as they
marched from the campus of Chungnam University, according to
Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. Riot police fired tear gas to
break up the demonstration.
   About 800 students at Taejon's Gongju University also fought
riot police with rocks and firebombs to demand a U.S. pullout,
Yonhap said. It said students announced an ``anti-U.S. campaign to
expel U.S. soldiers.''
   The U.S. Army headquarters supervises the 43,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea. Local residents and radicals, a small
minority on campuses, have staged violent protests against any move
of the U.S. headquarters to Taejon.
   In Seoul, National Police Headquarters released a report Friday
saying a total of 777 U.S. soldiers were charged under South Korean
law last year. It said seven were charged with rape, six with
burglary, and 231 with undefined violent acts. Most of the rest
were charged with violation of traffic regulations or contributing
to accidents, it said.
   The police report followed recent clashes involving U.S.
soldiers and Koreans in a popular shopping and entertainment
district near U.S. military headquarters in Seoul.
   The U.S. military said it could not immediately verify the
police numbers. One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said, ``Every GI who is turned over to us is dealt with. Every case
is investigated, and if a soldier has violated the law, he is
punished,'' the official said.
   American soldiers punished by the U.S. military sometimes face a
more severe sentence than under South Korean law, the official said.
   Most of the U.S. soldiers charged last year were released or
turned over to U.S. authorities under agreements between the U.S.
and South Korean governments, the police report said. Some
Americans have been tried in Korean courts, but the figures were
not given.
   South Korea has called for greater jurisdiction over crimes
involving U.S. soldiers, saying it wants to protect the rights of
Koreans.
   Anti-U.S. feeling has been generally based on a growing sense of
nationalism, fueled by a steady campaign by dissidents and trade
conflicts between the two countries.
   In another protest Friday, about 3,000 striking workers at South
Korea's state-run broadcasting network demanded the resignation of
a new government-appointed president they claim is not
reform-minded.
   About 1,500 riot police stood guard near the Seoul headquarters
of the KBS radio and television network, and the government issued
a statement warning union members would be ``sternly dealt with''
unless they returned to work.
   Union leaders said the government appointed Suh Ki-won as their
president to gain more influence in KBS programming. The last
president resigned in a scandal over company bookkeeping.
   The protest began Thursday, when hundreds of riot police entered
the KBS building and dragged away 117 protesters.
   Most news organizations in South Korea have strong unions
fighting for press freedom, media independence and workers'
interests.

   The teen-age son of Gov. George Mickelson
was involved in a drinking party at the executive mansion and was
acquitted of a sexual offense charge stemming from the incident,
the governor acknowledged Friday.
   Mickelson's statement to reporters was the first time he had
even admitted his son, David, was present during the Nov. 28 party.
   The governor and his wife, Linda, met with reporters shortly
after Circuit Judge Marshall Young sentenced three juvenile boys
for underage drinking.
   ``Today, Judge Young imposed a sentence on David for underage
drinking, which he readily admitted to,'' Mickelson said.
   The three boys, who admitted charges of underage consumption of
alcohol, were given varying terms of probation, ordered to perform
community service and undergo counseling for alcohol.
   The governor said his son, who was 17 at the time of the party,
was one of two juvenile boys acquitted of sexual offense charges
during a two-day, closed-door trial last month. One boy was
acquitted of non-forcible rape and the other was acquitted of
aiding and abetting rape.
   But the two were ordered to pay the medical bills of the alleged
victim.
   ``Even though Judge Young's decision meant our son was not
guilty, it does not lift entirely the pain that this incident has
caused,'' Mickelson said.
   Lawyers and court documents have referred to a 16-year-old girl
as the alleged victim in the case.
   Mickelson and his wife were out of town Nov. 28, but the
whereabouts of their son had not been disclosed until Friday.
   The governor said he had limited his comments about the case
because he believed it should be handled with the same privacy as
other juvenile court cases.
   But he said he regrets that he did not clarify a statement
issued by his office in December when reports of an alleged rape at
the mansion surfaced. The statement, which Mickelson said he had
approved, said the whereabouts of his son on the night of Nov. 28
were not relevant.
   ``Obviously, David's whereabouts were relevant,'' Mickelson said.
   Mickelson, who has two other children, said he and his wife sat
through last month's juvenile court trial with the parents of the
girl involved and with other parents and their children.
   ``This has been an agonizing experience for all of us,'' he said.
   ``In case anybody believes differently, we absolutely do not
approve the party that was held in our house on November 28th. It
was without our permission. It was without our knowledge,''
Mickelson said. ``Nor do we as parents approve of our son's
actions, and I can assure you that he is keenly aware of our
feelings.''
   He said his family regrets the whole matter ``more than anyone
will ever know.''
   ``In South Dakota, we have had for 100 years laws that provide
that juveniles can make mistakes and still not lose their hope for
a meaningful future,'' the governor said. ``Linda and I hope this
is true for all the young people involved in this matter.''

   President Bush has made clear to Guatemala
that the United States is alarmed over renewed political violence
but pleased at steps taken to counter it, the State Department said
Friday.
   Bush's message to Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo was
delivered by U.S. Ambassador Thomas Strook following his recent
recall to Washington for consultations on the violence, according
to Richard Boucher, the State Department's deputy spokesman.
   ``The ambassador and members of our embassy staff have made
clear to the government of Guatemala at all levels our concerns,''
Boucher said. ``We will continue to monitor the human rights
situation there very closely.''
   In recent weeks the Guatemalan government has ``taken a number
of steps and pledged to take additional measures to investigate
outstanding cases of human rights abuse and to strengthen the rule
of law,'' Boucher said.
   A special police investigative unit has been set up and the
government plans to submit to the Guatemalan Congress proposals for
reforming the penal code, he said.
   The State Department said later that it is understood that
Guatemalan police officers assigned to the new investigative unit
will be chosen from among those who have received training through
a program funded by the United States.
   Measures are also being taken to provide 24-hour protection for
judges and investigators and an office has been set up within the
national police force to investigate police abuse.
   ``We would also note the recent meeting in Oslo between
representatives of the National Reconciliation Commission and the
leftist guerrillas, which opens up the possibility for creating a
dialogue to end the 30-year-old internal conflict,'' Boucher said.
   ``We applaud this process of dialogue,'' he said.
   But in the meantime, he said, ``there continue to be reports of
violence.''
   ``For example, we're disturbed to note the recent killing of two
members of a rural activist group and an attack by civil patrol
members upon the deputy human rights ombudsman,'' Boucher said.
   Leftist guerrillas have been fighting for power in Guatemala for
more than four decades. Thousands have been kidnapped and slain by
rightist death squads widely believed to be linked to the military.
   Mutual Support, a human rights group, estimated that 40,000
people have disappeared, probably kidnapped and slain for political
motives, in the 20-year period ending in 1988. It said an average
of 300 people disappeared every month in 1981 and 1982.

   For nine years, through deportation and
war's devastation, Helena Krahelska kept shoes and shirts waiting.
   But in 1948, she acknowledged that her beloved husband Piotr had
been among the Polish army officers massacred by the Soviet secret
police in Katyn Forest.
   It took the Soviet government 42 more years to do the same.
   Mrs. Krahelska did not live to hear Moscow finally confess
Friday that the crime it blamed on the Nazis was actually committed
by the Soviet Union in ``one of the gravest crimes of Stalinism.''
   But her surviving daughter, Wanda Zadrozna, received the news
with eyes filled with tears.
   ``There is a great regret that it took 50 years and the wives of
those people didn't live until this day,'' Mrs. Zadrozna said.
``But whatever happens now, it is good that the truth will be
finally written in history.''
   Mrs. Zadrozna was 12 when she last saw her father, a landowner,
lawyer and town mayor in eastern Poland. As the Soviet army swept
into Poland at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it interned
15,000 Polish army officers.
   ``We got three letters, the last one was from March 5, 1940,''
Mrs. Zadrozna recalled, fingering the plastic wrapping around the
worn pages that record her father's last worries about his family's
fate.
   ``Then no one got any letters any more,'' she said.
   In 1943, the Nazis invading the Soviet Union unearthed the mass
graves of officers whose bodies were stacked atop each other. Most
were shot in the back of the head.
   ``This news was so horrible, no one wanted to believe it. We
treated it as propaganda,'' Mrs. Zadrozna said.
   ``Everybody was still waiting. My mother had everything for him,
and it wasn't easy because we had nothing. Sometimes she would
refresh the clothes because she hoped ... maybe he would come
back.''
   After hiding from Red Army death squads and barely escaping
transport to Siberia, Mrs. Krahelska and her daughters were
deported west at war's end from the Soviet-annexed eastern Poland
to the boundaries of the new Polish Communist state.
   Mrs. Krahelska gave up hope for her husband, but she was never
able to bury him or even mourn him openly. The Communist Polish
government backed the Soviet explanation and during the Stalinist
years people died for speaking of such things.
   Mrs. Zadrozna remembers her mother's ``naive'' effort to get a
widow's pension in 1949: ``When it turned out my father was at
Katyn, she was told to get out of the office as soon as possible
`or else you will find yourself where you don't want to be.'''
   ``All through those years, there were only silent memories. Only
symbolic graves with no inscription, but everyone knew here they
should light candles,'' Mrs. Zadrozna said.
   For her family, the toll also includes another Katyn victim, her
father's brother Stanislaw, a cousin killed fighting for the allies
in Italy and an aunt, a writer, who died in a concentration camp.
   ``This is my personal story. It is not an exception. There are
different stories, none less tragic,'' she said.
   But Katyn is among the deepest wounds in much-scarred Polish
history.
   Those killed were doctors, scientists, professors, the elite
called up from the army reserve. As Stalin planned, their places
leading Poland were taken by Soviet-backed functionaries as the
Communists consolidated power after the war.
   ``These were the best of their homeland,'' Mrs. Zadrozna said.
``It is not only I who have been missing them personally, but the
whole country has been missing them.''
   Mrs. Krahelska died at 84 in 1982, when ``nothing indicated that
people would talk about this,'' her daughter said. And even now,
Mrs. Zadrozna is surprised: ``I never thought that they would
recognize responsibility.''
   ``I have always felt sorry that not everybody has known the
truth because, at home and at school, nobody spoke about this,''
Mrs. Zadrozna said. ``Now everybody who goes to school will know
the history of this massacre. ... My grandchildren will know the
truth.''

<HEAD>Bush Would Cooperate on Tightening Export Laws</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Thatcher, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush pledged to cooperate in
tightening export laws if British investigators determine that an
Iraq-bound shipment of tubing seized in London was really the
makings of a huge gun.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, meeting reporters with
Bush after several hours of talks on a variety of subjects, said
her investigators have not decided what to make of the eight
sections of steel tubing confiscated Thursday from the docks at
Middlesbrough, England.
   Iraqi officials have said the tubing was intended for use in a
petrochemical plant. British Customs officials said it could be
used as an artillery barrel to fire a large projectile and was
subject to export licensing controls.
   ``The experts are still considering and confirming as to whether
it is a gun or simply large steel piping,'' the prime minister
said. ``They have not yet made up their minds if it is a gun.''
   Bush commended British intelligence and law enforcement agencies
for seizing the tubing shortly before it was to be shipped to Iraq.
   ``Anything we can do to keep guns or chemicals out of the hands
of terrorist nations, we should,'' he said. If it turns out the
tubing was an illegal weapons export, ``I would encourage and would
offer our cooperation to guarantee a total banning and firming up
the ban of weapons or potential weapons to countries that are
illegally getting them.''
   ``It is our purpose to keep such things out of the hands of the
Iraqi government,'' Bush said.
   He said there was ``superb cooperation between the U.K. and the
U.S. in trying to avert such breaches in the law. It isn't easy.
They got laws on their books. We got laws on our books.''
   But he added, ``If there's a way we can tighten up export
controls, certainly we ought to be doing it.''

<HEAD>Wine Country Bloodbath One Year Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a year since authorities found
the seven bodies, a year since the grisly massacre stunned the
bucolic wine country of Northern California.
   And that's too long for prosecutor Peter Bumerts, who is eager
to get Ramon Salcido in front of a jury and try him for the April
14, 1989, bloodbath.
   Killed in a series of shooting and slashing attacks were
Salcido's wife, two of their three daughters, his wife's mother,
his wife's two younger sisters and a co-worker at the winery where
Salcido worked.
   The third daughter, 3-year-old Carmina, was found in a garbage
dump next to the bodies of her sisters. Like her sisters, she had
her throat slashed, but Carmina survived, telling investigators
from her hospital bed, ``Dad hurt me.'' Her grandfather says she's
doing well today.
   Bumerts doesn't want to speculate on Salcido's motive. His main
concern has been the time pretrial maneuvering has consumed.
   ``It's amazing that it is a year and still there's no trial,''
said Bumerts.
   As a former public defender, he said, he understands the need to
protect a defendant's rights. ``But oftentimes, there's nothing
accomplished with all these delays,'' he said. ``It shouldn't take
a year to do these things.''
   Salcido, 29, was captured in his native Mexico five days after
the killings. Charges included seven counts of first-degree murder,
for which he could be sentenced to death.
   The trial is scheduled to begin July 9 in Redwood City, south of
San Francisco, where the case was moved because of publicity.
   It was clear that pressures had been building in Salcido's life.
   There were drugs. He was served with papers ordering him to pay
back child support to a former wife. His current wife, Angela, was
not aware Salcido had been married before, and made plans to leave
him when she found out.
   ``All of the above,'' defense attorney Marteen Miller replied
when asked what he thought was the main factor.
   ``His world just came tumbling down,'' said the public defender.
``He was always drinking, and then cocaine was added to it.'' In
addition, Miller said he was working on the theory his client had
brain damage that made him ``explosive.''
   Salcido left a note in the blood-splattered car he abandoned
before heading to Mexico: ``Forgive me, God, but this law made me
do it,'' he wrote in Spanish. ``We could live better, me and my
children, but what can I do?''
   ``People here still talk about it,'' said Dr. John Podboy, a
psychologist who lives a mile from the winery where Salcido drove a
forklift.
   Podboy, who has worked on 150 homicides as an expert witness,
said he won't be involved professionally, but sees several
interesting aspects of the case.
   For one thing, he said, men seldom kill their own children.
   ``Even more interesting is the allegation of a sustained period
of rage,'' said Podboy. ``People explode and then subside, but here
we have hours of homicidal conduct.''
   And although some people have tried to forget the crime spree,
Robert Richards can't. The rampage took the lives of his wife,
Marian Louise, 47; his daughters Ruth 12, Maria, 8, and Angela, 24;
and Angela's daughters Teresa 1, and Sofia, 4.
   The seventh victim was Tracy Toovey, 35, an assistant winemaker
at the Grand Cru winery in Kenwood, where Salcido worked; another
co-worker was wounded during the spree.
   Richards, who lives in Southern California with his surviving
granddaughter, says it's hard for him to forget, citing ``the 101
things you see every day'' that remind him of his family.
   ``Many things like this I will have to live with the rest of my
life,'' he said.
   But despite everything that's happened to her, he said, Carmina
is ``just like a normal child today. It's really an impressive
recovery physically and mentally. It's really remarkable.''
   One of the questions most often asked of Richards is what
Carmina saw the day of the killing spree. ``Of course, no one
knows,'' he said. ``I hope Carmina never remembers what she has
seen.''

   It won't be in time for this Easter, but an
Agriculture Department scientist says people one day will be able
to buy blooming lilies throughout the year.
   Horticulturist Mark S. Roh of the department's Agricultural
Research Service said a special treatment has been developed which
``brings a lily from a very small bulb to bloom in about 280 days
instead of two to three years. And in living colors, not just
traditional white.''
   He said the hybrid lily colors include red, creamy yellow and
bright lavender flowers on 12- to 25-inch stems.
   The new procedure bypasses the field production of lilies
altogether, allowing them to undergo forced controlled growth in
greenhouses to reduce major viruses and soil-borne fungal diseases
that plague field-grown lilies.
   Roh said in a report by the agency that he plans to formally
release the hybrid lilies to nurseries this year.
   ``When the method is commercialized, a company would probably
offer the treated bulbils, or small bulbs, to nurseries that would
in turn produce potted plants or cut flowers for consumers,'' the
report said.
   U.S. growers sold more than 9 million potted lilies in 1988 at a
wholesale value of more than $34 million, according to the most
recent USDA figures.

   One importer of a major brand of electric bug
killers has reissued a recall for four of its models, a government
agency said Friday.
   The back yard devices are being recalled because they present a
potential fire hazard. Few consumers have returned them as
originally requested last summer, according to the Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
   Dead insects accumulating in the devices and high humidity can
cause them to catch fire.
   The company knows of 20 such fires that caused property damage.
   The recall involves Charmglow bug killer models 071512, 073425,
074001 and 078012.
   The CPSC said just 195 of the 8,000 bug killers that were sold
nationwide in 1987 have been returned.
   Buyers should contact the importer _ Allied Tube and Conduit
Corp. of Harvey, Ill. _ at 1-800-558-5502 for directions on how to
return the bug killers for a full refund.

<HEAD>West Germany Arrests Four as East German Spies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials arrested four people this
month as spies for the East, and a national magazine said Friday
one is a bigger catch than the communist spy who forced the 1974
resignation of Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   Last week, Heinz-Helmuth Werner, 45, a cipher clerk at West
Germany's NATO mission in Brussels, was arrested and an
unidentified 38-year-old engineer suspected of working for the
Soviet KGB was jailed in southern West Germany.
   This week, according to the Chief Federal Prosecutor's office in
Karlsruhe, two senior government employees were arrested on
suspicion of providing secrets to ``an East European country.''
   Der Spiegel magazine, headquartered in Hamburg, quoted a West
German counter-intelligence source as saying Werner disclosed far
more sensitive material to the Warsaw Pact than did the 1970s East
German spy Guenther Guillaume, Brandt's top aide.
   Brandt resigned after Guillaume's arrest. Guillaume drew 13
years in prison in 1975. Six years later he was traded to East
Germany in a spy swap.
   Compared to Werner, ``Guillaume was small stuff,'' Spiegel
quoted an unidentified government security source as saying.
   A copy of the publication, which appears on newsstands Saturday,
was obtained early by The Associated Press.
   Werner was arrested April 5 in Brussels.
   Der Spiegel said Werner provided contacts in East Germany and
the Soviet KGB in Moscow with ``detailed information on internal
NATO discussions about short-range nuclear missiles and Western
options for negotiation at ongoing disarmament talks in Vienna.''
   It said Werner was paid the past 20 years by the East German
security service and had worked as a deciphering clerk in Brussels
since September 1987.
   The magazine, quoting its sources, said sensitive information on
``Bonn's and its partners' political plans for Germany were
furnished Eastern agents up through the last few weeks'' by Werner.
   Quoting an unidentified diplomat, Spiegel said it now was easy
to understand Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Schevardnadze's recent
comment at a meeting with West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher: ``Mr. Genscher, we know your plans very
well.''
   Rolf Hannich, spokesman for the Chief Federal Prosecutor's
office, said a senior Foreign Ministry employee was arrested
Tuesday and a senior federal border police officer Wednesday. Both
are suspected of spying for the East.
   Hannich also confirmed on Thursday reports that an engineer
working in southern Baden-Wuerttemberg has been in investigative
custody since April 4.
   He is suspected of spying and providing restricted electronic
equipment to the KGB, Hannich said.
   Hannich refused to give details, citing continuing
investigations.
   However, sources in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the ministry employee had worked at Bonn's UNESCO mission _
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization _ in Paris.
   Bild newspaper reported Thursday that a tip leading to the
employee's arrest came from a former official of East German
intelligence. It said the suspect had been working for the Foreign
Ministry since the mid-1970s.
   The arrests follow recent news media reports that East German
intelligence agents are still gathering information on high-ranking
West German officials.
   Die Welt newspaper in Bonn on Thursday quoted Ottfried Henning,
a state secretary in the Ministry of Inner-German relations, as
saying officials' telephone calls were still being monitored by
East German security agents.

   The distributor of a baby pacifier is
recalling more than 47,000 of them because they may present a
suffocation or strangulation hazard to young children, the
government said Friday.
   Consolidated Stores of Columbus, Ohio, is recalling 47,520 of
its ``bib to bowl'' pacifiers because they don't have ventilation
holes in the guards or shields, as required by law, the commission
said.
   The pacifiers were sold nationwide from May through -November
1989 at Odd Lots or Big Lots Stores in packages labeled in English
and French ``bib to bowl, Sterilized Pacifier, birth to 24 months,
1852037.''
   Consumers should return the pacifiers to the store where
purchased for a full refund or contact Consolidated Stores at

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German officials are bracing for a
resurgence of leftist terrorism and right-wing extremism as a
result of the coming unification of the two Germanys, published
reports said Friday.
   East and West German Cabinet ministers meanwhile were preparing
talks as early as next week to meet the July 1 goal of a
``monetary, social and economic union.''
   In an interview with the respected Bonn newspaper Die Welt, the
head of West Germany's criminal investigations office said the
leftist Red Army Faction terror gang views the unification process
as a ``wide open field.''
   ``It is conceivable that the progress in unification also
presents a potential danger,'' Die Welt quoted Hans-Ludwig Zachert
as saying.
   Zachert said his office already had been in contact with its
counterparts in East Germany.
   The Red Army Faction, after a series of attacks and slayings in
the 1970s, remains in officials' eyes a continuing threat. The
latest major attack attributed to the gang was the Nov. 30 slaying
of Alfred Herrhausen, the No. 1 banker in West Germany.
   Zachert also warned the tumult in East Germany could bring an
increase in organized crime and drug trafficking, which were
virtually unknown under the toppled hard-line Communist regime.
   In Hamburg, the respected newsmagazie Der Spiegel reported West
German counterintelligence officials were stepping up surveillance
of the far right.
   ``Right-wing groups increasingly are striking up contacts in
East Germany and getting good feedback there,'' the magazine
reported.
   West Germany's extreme rightist Republican Party, despite facing
mounting troubles at home, claims to have found recruits in East
Germany since November's peaceful revolution.
   Der Spiegel quoted officials as saying in a report that ``after
40 years of political oppression, it follows as a matter of course
that there will be radical to extreme rightist developments.''
   Ultrarightists have tried to disrupt the weekly pro-democracy
demonstrations in Leipzig several times.
   The magazine quoted officials as saying that right-wing
extremism was likely to increase in a united Germany and that
leftist terrorists had already found like-minded comrades in East
Germany.
   ``Unification, the officials estimate, will lead to new
activities of the Red Army Faction,'' according to Der Spiegel.
   In Bonn, Foreign Minster Hans-Dietrich Genscher said he wants to
meet soon with his new East German counterpart, Markus Meckel, to
prepare for unification talks involving the United States and the
Soviet Union.
   Genscher, according to the Express newspaper of Cologne, said
there was a ``highest measure of agreement'' between the two
Germanys and that ``with such a common interest we Germans could be
the architects of an undivided Europe.''
   East Germany's new non-Communist government, led by Christian
Democrat Lothar de Maiziere, took office Thursday.

   A woman who dresses without a bra said she
was humiliated by a municipal judge who found her in contempt
because her breasts were ``obviously showing.''
   ``The court found her offensive and informed her of that,''
Judge Don West said of his contempt order against Melissa Thurston,
21. ``I've been on the bench eight years and never had a problem
like that.''
   Melissa Thurston, 21, said she was humiliated by the judge's
action Wednesday and said her attire was not inappropriate. She
also said she plans to sue the judge.
   ``There was a courtroom full of people _ about 50 or 60 _ I was
so humiliated I didn't want to turn around,'' Ms. Thurston said.
   ``I was wearing a high neck sweater,'' she said. ``It wasn't
see-through or anything. He had to be staring right at me.''
   The judge said the contempt order carried no fine or sentence,
but he told her to never appear in his court again unless she was
dressed appropriately.
   ``She was improperly dressed for the courtroom because it was my
impression and several other people's impression that her breasts
were obviously showing,'' West said.
   West said he ordered Ms. Thurston jailed until she could come up
with $170 in restitution for rented videotapes that she failed to
return. He found Ms. Thurston guilty of theft but said a $300 fine
and 15-day jail sentence would be suspended if she paid the
restitution.
   Ms. Thurston had to appear before West again Thursday on a
charge of failing to register a motor vehicle. She said she wore a
bra and was not fined for the new offense.
   ``By the way, she was properly attired today,'' West said
Thursday.

   A guerrilla faction in Cambodia has
withdrawn from two northwestern towns in an effort to show it is
not responsible for cases of rape, black marketeering and banditry
reported there, the group said Friday.
   A statement from the guerrilla group loyal to Prince Norodom
Sihanouk said its fighters had pulled out of the towns of Thmar
Puok and Treas on Thursday. The faction and an allied group
captured the towns two days before.
   Sihanouk's faction said its pullout will show that it ``cannot
be held responsible for any violations of human rights, black
market activities, banditry and other exactions committed in those
above mentioned areas.''
   Sihanouk fighters and the other non-communist faction in the
guerrilla coalition, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front,
retook the area Tuesday in seesaw fighting with government forces.
The Liberation Front has acknowledged in the past that some of its
fighters have been guilty of misconduct in guerrilla-held areas.
   ``In the future, if people make accusations of smuggling and
raping, you can be sure that (we) are not involved,'' said Ek
Sereywath, a spokeman for Sihanouk's group in Bangkok. ``We are
leaving Thmar Puok under the control of the KPNLF,'' he said.
   Sihanouk's group said it would in the future concentrate their
efforts in other areas.
   Its spokeman refused to confirm that rights abuses had occurred
in guerrilla areas. But he acknowledged there were many such
accusations in Western press reports and by rights groups.
   Sihanouk's forces are considered the weakest of the loose
three-faction guerrilla coalition opposing the Vietnamese-installed
government in Phnom Penh. The third and strongest faction is the
Communist Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians when it ruled Cambodia in the 1970s.

   The Soviet Union apologized Friday for one of the
grisliest crimes of the Stalin era: the murder of thousands of
imprisoned Polish officers shot during World War II and buried in
mass graves in the Katyn Forest.
   The confession ended nearly 50 years of official Soviet denial
and had been almost a prerequisite for improved Polish-Soviet
relations. The Soviet Union previously insisted that Nazi Germany
was responsible for the massacre.
   Polish and Western historians long have blamed the NKVD, Josef
Stalin's secret police, for killing more than 4,000 officers in the
Katyn Forest near Smolensk. They were captured by the Soviets at
the beginning of World War II.
   More than 10,000 other Polish officers were killed in camps
elsewhere. Their bodies have never been found, but in its statement
Friday the Soviet Union clearly tied together the fates of all
15,000 officers, some of the cream of prewar Polish society.
   The admission came 47 years to the day when the Nazis announced
the discovery of the Katyn graves. And it came one day after East
Germany's new Parliament apologized for the Holocaust and for the
deaths of millions of Soviets in World War II.
   The statement carried by the official news agency Tass was
issued as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with Polish President
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Poland had urged the Soviet Union to admit responsibility for
the mass slayings, saying such ``blank spots'' in history were a
barrier to better Polish-Soviet relations.
   Gorbachev gave Jaruzelski copies of the material from Soviet
archives pertaining to the Poles imprisoned in the NKVD camps, Tass
reported.
   In a speech at a dinner Friday night honoring Jaruzelski,
Gorbachev referred to the massacre, Tass reported. He said the two
leaders talked about ``those historical `knots' that even many
years later cast shadows on our relations. Many of them are undone
already.''
   ``Recently, documents have been discovered which indirectly but
convincingly testify that thousands of Polish officers who died in
the Smolensk woods half a century ago became victims of (Stalin's
secret police chief Lavrenti) Beria and his henchmen,'' Tass quoted
Gorbachev as saying.
   ``The graves of the Polish officers are near Soviet people's
graves, who fell from the same evil hand,'' he said. ``It is not
easy to speak about this tragedy but we must speak about it for
only through the truth there lies the way to genuine renewal and to
genuine mutual understanding.''
   The earlier statement said the ``Soviet side, expressing its
deep regret in connection with the Katyn tragedy, states that it is
one of the most horrifying Stalinist crimes,'' Tass said.
   ``It's good that criminals admit their crimes,'' Polish
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said in Gdansk. But other problems
remain, including war reparations, he said.
   The massacre has caused bitterness among Poles for years despite
the previous Communist government's loyal statements supporting the
Soviet Union.
   Jaruzelski is scheduled to visit a memorial at Katyn on
Saturday, following pilgrimages of Poles whose relatives and
friends died in the massacre.
   The officers were captured by the Soviet Union when it invaded
eastern Poland at the beginning of World War II, shortly after
Hitler sent his soldiers across Poland's western border to start
the war.
   They were shot in the back of the head and stacked in layers in
mass graves. The bodies were found in April 1943 by German soldiers
who captured the area during World War II. They were immediately
used for propaganda purposes.
   Stalin blamed the Nazis for the deaths. Soviet historians
recently began questioning that version, but it stood until the
Soviet Union admitted responsibility Friday. A U.S. congressional
committee in the early 1950s blamed the Soviets.
   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, the Soviet Union has
brought to light many of the deeds of Stalin and his henchmen, but
Katyn was one of the final affairs to be touched by the greater
openness.
   Records indicate that only 394 of the 15,000 captured Polish
prisoners were transferred to the Gryazovetsky prison camp. The
rest were turned over to the NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB, in
Smolensk; Voroshilovgrad in the Ukraine; and Kalinin northwest of
Moscow. All the officers disappeared from NKVD records, Tass said.
   Beria and others were executed after Stalin died in 1953.
   Historian Natalia Lebedeva, writing in the weekly Moscow News on
March 25, said the officers apparently were killed in a single
operation as the NKVD evacuated three camps. The Soviets might have
considered the Polish officers a threat as potential future leaders
of Poland.
   Ms. Lebedeva, who used Soviet central archives and Soviet army
records, called it a ``well-thought-through and carefully planned
operation.''
   In Warsaw, Polish relatives of the victims were pleased the
truth finally had come out, but expressed regret it took so long.
   ``I awfully regret that my mother could not live until this
day,'' said Wanda Zadrozna, crying as she recalled her father's
murder. ``There is a great regret that it took 50 years and the
wives of those people didn't live until this day.''
   ``But whatever happens now, it is good that the truth will be
finally written in history,'' she said.

   The separate Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine

to streamline operations and provide better service, the Pentagon
announced Friday.
   The four systems, a Pentagon statement said, ``constitute one of
the largest grocery story operations in the United States.
Consolidating them into a single organization will achieve the
kinds of efficiencies and economies available to a commercial
grocery store chain.''
   There are 413 commissaries in the four branches of the military

   A recent Defense Department study indicated that consolidation
save about $90 million an year and improve service to members of
the armed services and their families, the statement said.
   The department also intends to consolidate the supply depot
operations of the military services and the Defense Logistics
Agency. The first consolidation will take place among the five
depots in the San Francisco Bay area, the statement said.
   The department's 35 supply depots in the United States operate
3,400 warehouses, storing supplies valued at $95 billion and $23
billion worth of ammunition, the statement said.

   Poles on Friday sadly accepted a Soviet
acknowledgement of guilt for the massacre of thousands of Polish
officers 50 years ago, but they said they want reparations and more
details of war crimes.
   ``It's good that criminals admit their crimes,'' said Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa in the northern city of Gdansk. He called the
Soviet admission ``an act of moral justice.''
   However, he said, there must be ``punishment of those guilty of
the genocide,'' reparations for the victims' survivors and access
for Poles to the final resting places.
   The massacre of 15,000 Polish officers at Katyn and two other
sites, yet unknown, had seared the national consciousness. The pain
had been made worse by the decades in which it was forbidden even
to speak of Soviet responsibility for the crimes.
   ``The long-awaited moment ... has come,'' government spokeswoman
Malgorzata Niezabitowska said Friday after Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev handed over to President Wojciech Jaruzelski documents
establishing dictator Josef Stalin's secret police killed the
officers on Soviet territory in World War II.
   ``The event which took place 50 years ago in the Smolensk forest
has burdened relations between our two countries in the most
painful way,'' the Polish spokeswoman said. ``Reconciliation can be
built only on truth.''
   ``I feel a great joy now that after so many years, the truth has
been revealed,'' said Bozena Lojek, whose late husband's father
died at Katyn and who helps lead an group of victims' relatives
called the Katyn Family.
   ``For us, it is a great success,'' she said, leading to ``many
political and economic consequences.''
   Relatives have called for criminal proceedings against anyone
still alive bearing responsibility and for payment of damages.
   Mrs. Niezabitowska said the Polish government recognizes the
significance of the official Soviet statement but wants more
questions cleared up.
   ``We await an explanation of all the `blank spots' in our common
history, which the Katyn crime symbolizes for us,'' she said.
   The bodies of more than 4,200 officers, who had been interned by
the Soviets at Kozielsk, were uncovered in the Katyn forest. But
the remains of 10,000 other officers captive at camps in
Starobielsk and Ostashkow have never been found, and word on their
fate remains a key demand of their families.
   ``The point is the Russians don't want to reveal the other
massacre sites,'' said Polish historian Wojciech Ziembinski. ``It's
false, it's a lie, just like for the last 50 years.''
   The Katyn bodies, shot in the back of the head and stacked in
mass graves, were found by the Nazis in April 1943 and immediately
used for propaganda purposes against the Allies. The Soviets
instead maintained the officers were killed in 1941 by the Nazis
after they invaded the Soviet Union.
   Although Poland's Communist governments after the war echoed the
Soviet explanation, most Poles and Western historians had long
concluded that the massacre was committed by the Soviet forces on
Stalin's order in late April and early May 1940.
   ``We all knew,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, the historian who heads
Solidarity's parliamentary caucus. ``What today's communique
brings, it brings late and perhaps too little.''
   In London, the British government welcomed the Soviet admission.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the ``terrible things'' that
Stalin did cannot be forgotten, but he added the world should also
remember the ``terrible things'' done to the Soviets.

<TEXT>
   King Hussein said in broadcast remarks
Friday that Jerusalem should be kept united and given special
status, but with Arab sovereignty over the Arab eastern sector of
the city.
   He attacked a non-binding resolution by the U.S. Senate last
month that recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
   The king also repeated warnings that without action toward a
peace settlement ``we are coming to a very, very dangerous
crossroads very, very soon,'' which could lead to an upsurge of
extremism both in Israel and the Arab world.
   Hussein spoke in an interview carried by state Jordan
television. The TV said the interview was conducted with CNN.
   Jordan ruled the eastern half of the holy city until Israel
captured it in the 1967 Middle East war. Hussein said east
Jerusalem is part of the occupied West Bank.
   Israel has annexed east Jerusalem, together with a wide swath of
suburbs, and says it will never give them up.
   About 350 people staged a candlelight demonstration across the
street from the U.S. Embassy in Amman on Friday night. They were
protesting the Senate resolution; a new Israeli Jewish settlement
in the Christian sector of Jerusalem this week; and alleged Israeli
mistreatment of clergymen.
   It was the first officially permitted protest in many years
outside the embassy, and the first of any kind since a small
illegal demonstration against the U.S. bombing of Libya in 1986.
   The monarch said Jerusalem is ``too important an issue to be
dealt with as a political pawn.
   ``It is too great a city to be only the capital of Israel.''
   Hussein indicated he favored giving the city ``special status''
in any Arab-Israeli peace settlements.
   ``In the context of peace, one does not envisage that Jerusalem
would be divided, yet at the same time Arab sovereignty over the
Arab part of the city has to be assured.''
   In such a way, ``the rights of Christians and Moslems and Jews
can be safeguarded,'' he said.

   East German Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel said Friday his country must get rid of its
flag in the process of unification with West Germany, the West
German newspaper Bild reported.
   The flag depicts a circle of grain around a draftsman's compass
imposed on a hammer. The emblem signifies a people's or worker's
nation.
   ``The emblem with the hammer and compass must go,'' Bild quoted
Diestel as saying in an interview. ``The flag must again be only
black, red and gold'' _ identical with West Germany's.
   Diestel was confirmed as interior minister in the new government
on Thursday.
   The paper quoted him as saying he wants a regulated unification
process to guarantee the rights of East Germans _ ``The government
wants to insure that ... (East German) citizens will not be called
on to pay again'' for past mistakes.
   Diestel wants insurance that the East German mark will be
exchanged on a one-to-one basis with the West German mark when
monetary and economic union planned for this summer comes, Bild
reported.

   Soviet lawmakers recommended top Moscow-based
experts for ambassadorships in key Western and European nations,
Tass said Friday. In the past, envoys were picked largely on the
basis of Communist Party affiliation.
   The news agency also said lawmakers are considering major
changes in the Foreign Ministry, though it did not provide details.
   The Supreme Soviet Committee for Foreign Affairs met Thursday
and approved the candidacies of 10 ambassadors, the news agency
said. The candidates still face confirmation by the full Supreme
Soviet legislature, but no date for a vote was announced.
   ``Among the candidates are four deputy foreign ministers and
other prominent diplomats who played the key role in shaping the
Soviet Union's foreign policy know worldwide as `new thinking,'''
Tass said.
   The news agency quoted committee members as saying the debate on
diplomatic appointments was ``a new stage in the development of
relationships between the parliament and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.''
   The committee recommended that First Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Bessmertnykh be appointed ambassador to the United States
and First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov be given the post
of ambassador to the United Nations.
   Bessmertnykh's appointment to Washington had been reported at
the time of Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's visit earlier
this month. He served in the Soviet Embassy in Washington for 13
years before returning to Moscow in 1983.
   Vorontsov was sent as trouble-shooting ambassador to Afghanistan
as Soviet soldiers were withdrawing from that country. The last
Soviet forces left in February 1989.
   Yuri Dubinin, the current envoy to Washington, was recommended
for reassignment to France while the present U.N. ambassador,
Alexander Belonogov, will return to Moscow with the title of deputy
foreign minister.
   Other recommended diplomatic changes were to take place at key
diplomatic postings in Eastern Europe with the retirement of
several ambassadors, including members of the Communist party's
Central Committee, Tass said.

   Criminal charges were filed Friday
against former Yugoslav Vice President Fadil Hoxha, accusing him of
fanning ethnic Albanian nationalism in Kosovo province in 1986,
Tanjug news agency reported.
   The public prosecutor in Prizren, a Kosovo town near the
Albanian border, was quoted as saying Hoxha ``triggered
nationalist, racial and religious hatred'' in November 1986 when he
publicly made ``offensive remarks'' about non-Albanian women.
   Hoxha, an ethnic Albanian, faces up to 10 years in prison if
convicted.
   Hoxha, now retired, was a close associate of the late Yugoslav
President Josip Tito and was the country's vice president in the
late 1970s.
   He was ousted from membership in the ruling Communist Party in
September 1987 for alleged support of Albanian nationalism and
demands for greater autonomy for troubled Kosovo province, which is
90 percent ethnic Albanian.
   Kosovo is administratively part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest
republic.
   Hoxha was the focus of a media campaign in Serbia and angry
demonstrations in October 1987 by Serbian women living in Kosovo
for offensive remarks he allegedly made about them at an unofficial
gathering of reserve army officers.
   Published reports said Hoxha recommended Serbian women be
allowed to solicit as prostitutes in Kosovo to guard against what
newspapers claimed were increasing incidents of sexual assault by
Albanian men against non-Albanian women in the province.
   In a statement, Hoxha later said his remarks had been
misinterpreted and taken out of context by the Serbian media.
   Kosovo has been the scene of nationalist protests by ethnic
Albanians since 1981, stirring a backlash by the Serbian minority.
Serbian police and the military maintain order in the province.
   In February 1989, year, Serbia amended its constitution,
severely limiting the autonomy previously enjoyed by Kosovo. The
move set off riots that have killed at least 60 people.

   Libyan-backed Palestinian leader Ahmed
Jibril on Friday attacked the Soviet Union for allowing Jews to
emigrate to Israel, the first time the usually pro-Soviet leader
has attacked Moscow.
   ``The Soviet Union's leadership is responsible for the migration
of the Soviet Jews'' to Israel, said the Syrian-based Jibril, head
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command.
   ``It is part of an international conspiracy to settle these Jews
in Palestine.''
   He named the United States as another participant in the alleged
conspiracy. Increased Jewish emigration to Israel has been prompted
by relaxed Soviet rules and tightened U.S. visa quotas.
   Israel expects hundreds of thousands of Jews to arrive from the
Soviet Union in the next few years. The influx has stirred outrage
in the Arab world, which fears they will be settled in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   It was the first criticism of Soviet policy from Jibril's group.
   The Soviet Union's policy of allowing Jews to emigrate to Israel
has sown consternation among traditionally pro-Soviet Palestinian
factions.
   Addressing a large rally, Jibril also pledged to ``escalate the
armed struggle against Zionism.''
   His group participated in a Syrian-backed mutiny against
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat in 1983 and
remains among his staunchest opponents.
   The group abhors Arafat's policy of renouncing terrorism and
recognition of Israel to open the way for peace talks.

<TEXT>
   NBC News urged a federal appeals court
Friday to reverse a $5.3 million libel judgment won by entertainer
Wayne Newton, saying a 1980 broadcast was guilty of only one thing
_ aggressive journalism.
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, argued that a jury found NBC had
``ill will'' toward Newton and said the verdict should stand.
   But NBC lawyer Floyd Abrams said the report linking Newton to
organized crime figures was correct. Abrams, a noted First
Amendment lawyer, argued that investigative reporting would suffer
if the decision were upheld.
   The two lawyers spoke during 30-minute oral summations to their
arguments at the hearing before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeal. The court's decision will be announced at a later date.
   A Las Vegas federal jury decided in December 1986 that the
network had willfully libeled Newton by claiming he had ties to
organized crime. The jury gave him the largest libel award in
history _ $19.2 million in damages.
   Presiding U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker of Fresno eventually
reduced that award to $5.3 million.
   Numerous media groups, including rival networks CBS, ABC and
Fox, several major newspaper chains and The Associated Press have
joined NBC's appeal of the libel verdict.
   During Friday's hearing, Judge William Norris of the
three-member panel likened the NBC team to Robert Woodward and Carl
Bernstein, the Washington Post reporters who broke the Watergate
scandal.
   ``Would a jury have a basis for finding Carl Bernstein and
Robert Woodward had ill will in pursuing the Watergate story?'' he
asked Newton's lawyer.
   Galane said they would not because those reporters were ordered
by their publisher to verify every fact through at least two
sources.
   But Norris suggested the Newton case might discourage
investigative reporting and prevent stories comparable to a
Watergate scandal from being uncovered.
   ``We tread a very fine line here to make sure that future
Woodwards and Bernsteins are not inhibited in pursuing their
stories,'' said Norris.
   Galane responded, ``We are not intending to inhibit such
goals,'' and declared at one point: ``We're not here to launch an
attack on the media or the First Amendment.''
   But he maintained that NBC had erred by not interviewing Newton
about its allegations.
   Abrams countered that Newton had refused numerous requests for
such an interview.
   Newton, who listened to the arguments from a front row seat,
later told reporters he still feels the impact of the 1980
broadcast that linked him to reputed mob figure Guido Penosi.
   ``The effects of what they said will last me the rest of my
life,'' he said.
   NBC reporter Brian Ross said he and his co-defendants, producer
Ira Silverman and executive producer Paul Greenberg, were ``very
optimistic'' about having the verdict overturned. All three
attended the hearing.
   The case began Oct. 6, 1980, with Ross' report ``Wayne Newton
and the Law.'' Ross reported that Newton had gone to Penosi for
help with a problem and that unnamed federal sources were looking
at Newton's relationship to two East Coast crime figures.
   The reports said one mobster had bragged of earning an interest
in Las Vegas' Aladdin Hotel, which Newton owned at the time.
   Newton claimed the report left the impression that his October
1980 purchase of the Aladdin was tied to organized crime _ which he
denies. Newton later sold the hotel.
   Abrams told reporters outside court: ``I think that a loss in
this case would make it very difficult for the press to report
about investigations and suspicions about prominent public figures,
particularly in their own community.''
   Judge Dorothy Nelson and chief appellate Judge Alfred Goodwin
joined Norris on the panel. Nelson expressed interest in an NBC
argument that the case should have been moved out of Las Vegas.
   Abrams said the defense submitted data on ``Mr. Newton's general
adulation in Las Vegas'' but was unable to win a change of venue.
   ``It was nearly hopeless for us to get a fair trial in Las
Vegas,'' he said.

<HEAD>New York-Bound Kurt Masur Also Plans to Keep East German Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German conductor Kurt Masur, named this week
to be music director of the New York Philharmonic, said Friday he
will keep his orchestral post in Leipzig even after he starts the
new job.
   But despite an active role in his country's democratic
revolution last year, he said he has no plans to follow fellow
artists such as Czechoslovak playwright Vaclav Havel and Peruvian
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa into politics.
   ``Being a musician is a wonderful profession,'' Masur said.
``Why should I change?''
   Masur, 62, spoke in a telephone interview while in Paris to
conduct a performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion with the
National Orchestra of France and choral groups from Leipzig at a
medieval church in suburban Saint Denis.
   ``It just isn't true that I'm leaving Leipzig,'' he said,
denying reports that surfaced after his New York appointment.
``Lots of conductors work with two, even three orchestras at a
time.''
   ``In fact, I'll be conducting fewer performances in New York
than in Leipzig,'' he said. ``I have an indefinite contract with
the Gewandhaus Orchestra. I grew up there, I was taught by
Gewandhaus musicians, and I would be foolish to leave an orchestra
that we have built up as a wonderful family.''
   The New York Philharmonic announced Wednesday that Masur would
conduct a minimum of 14 subscription weeks and four weeks of other
activities each season.
   Masur, who succeeds Zubin Mehta in New York, said he was very
excited about the post, which he has accepted for a five-year
period beginning in 1992.
   ``I would like to build up chamber music life inside the
orchestra itself the way we did in Leipzig,'' he said. ``It builds
up the qualities of the orchestra and gives more exposure to the
musicians.''
   Last year, Masur played a major role in avoiding violence during
the revolution that swept East Germany. In early October, during a
demonstration of thousands of people in Leipzig, he gathered a
clergymen, an opposition activist and three local Communist Party
officials at his home and then taped a statement, broadcast through
loudspeakers, saying the party committed itself to negotiation and
nonviolence.
   The statement represented a change in approach from that of
hard-line Communist ruler Erich Honecker, forced to resign Oct. 18.
   ``I was needed at that moment and I did what was necessary,'' he
said. ''I will live in Leipzig, hoping that life will go as we
imagined it during the revolution.
   Masur said he was not sure that German unification would be
beneficial to East German artists.
   ``Their future is in danger, financially,'' he said. ``This is
still a big question mark for me.''
   ``Freedom is a wonderful gift for our country, but like in
sports (where government subsidies for East German athletes are
likely to be curtailed), nobody should expect things to be better.
It's simply not true.''

<HEAD>Democratic Forum Begins Coalition Talks With Christian Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conservative Hungarian Democratic
Forum began coalition talks Friday with the Christian Democrats to
form a non-Communist government, the state news agency MTI reported.
   The Democratic Forum captured 165 of Parliament's 386 seats in
elections Sunday, 29 short of a majority.
   The elections were the first free balloting in Hungary in 43
years.
   A meeting Thursday of 1,186 Democratic Forum delegates met and
gave formal approval to coalition talks with the Christian
Democrats and another conservative party, the Independent
Smallholders' Party. The coalition would control 60 percent of
Parliament.
   The party has ruled out any coalition with reform-minded
Communists, who ran as the Socialist Party.
   The Smallholders won 43 seats, the Christian Democrats 21 seats
and the Socialists, 33 seats.
   The Democratic Forum emphasizes Hungarian tradition and
Christian values and favors the introduction of market forces into
Hungary's socialist economy at a gradual pace to soften the effects
of inflation and unemployment.
   The second strongest party, the Free Democrats, was formed by
former leading dissidents and campaigned for rapid economic
changes. The party won 96 seats and will most likely head the
opposition.
   It was not known when negotiations with the Smallholders would
begin, but Democratic Forum leaders said the new government would
be formed in mid-May at the earliest.
   Democratic Forum's deputy chairman, Ferenc Kulin, said his party
would demand ``the strategically important portfolios'' in any
future government. He said the party wanted to control the
ministries of foreign affairs, finance and interior, but not
defense.
   Kulin quoted party leader and likely prime minister-designate
Jozsef Antall as telling Thursday's conference that the new
government will ``extend a hand in friendship to the peoples of the
Soviet Union, if they remove the handcuffs.''
   Hungary's first democratically elected Parliament will convene
May 2 to elect a speaker, who will automatically serve as interim
president until a new president is elected.
   Socialist Matyas Szueroes has served as interim president since
October, when a series of constitutional reforms were adopted.

   A man distraught over the breakup of his
marriage wounded two men, killed his estranged wife and held two
children hostage overnight, then killed himself Friday to end a
17-hour standoff, police said.
   The bodies of Mike Purcell, 38, of Collinsville, Va., and
Jeannie Purcell, 33, of Lexington, were found in separate bedrooms
of Mrs. Purcell's sister's house about 4 p.m. EDT, said Police
Chief Larry Walsh.
   Police decided to storm the house after a breakdown in
negotiations, which began early Friday.
   ``He was getting worse instead of better. He wanted us to kill
him,'' Walsh said. ``We had no alternative but to move on him.''
   Walsh said Purcell appeared to have killed himself shortly after
police began an assault with tear gas and percussion grenades. But
Mrs. Purcell apparently had been dead since 11 p.m. Thursday, he
said.
   Walsh said Purcell had many mood swings during the negotiations
but always seemed to be in control.
   ``He played mind games. He would talk in circles,'' the chief
said.
   Police had been patient with Purcell because they were concerned
about the lives of Mrs. Purcell, unaware she was already dead, and
officers at the scene, Walsh said. The children _ Troy Jamison, 4,
and Brittany Jamison, 1 _ had been held hostage overnight and
released about 10 a.m. Friday.
   Troy is the son of Mark Jamison and Brittany is the daughter of
Liz Jamison, Mrs. Purcell's sister. They all lived in the house.
   Purcell stayed out of the sight of police snipers. ``He was
smart. He knew what he was doing,'' Walsh said.
   Police said the incident began about 10 p.m. Thursday when
Purcell, armed with a 9mm pistol, allegedly shot Wayne Deaton, who
had arrived to pick up Mrs. Purcell for a date, and Mark Jamison,
Mrs. Purcell's brother. Both remained hospitalized Friday, Deaton
in critical condition and Jamison in serious condition, hospital
officials said.
   ``I saw him with the gun,'' Liz Jamison said of Purcell. ``He
shot at me and made my sister go upstairs. That's when I ran out
the back door to the neighbor's house and called the police.''
   Ms. Jamison said her sister and Purcell had been married three
years.
   On Jan. 19 and again on Feb. 1, a Fayette District Court ordered
Purcell to stay away from his wife because of domestic violence.
But he violated both protection orders and was held in contempt of
court each time, said Police Lt. Drexel Neal.
   During the standoff, Purcell became upset when television
reports touched on that aspect and demanded an interview with a
reporter to give his side of the story. Deborah Moore of WVLK-FM
said Purcell told her by telephone that he had been distraught ever
since his wife left him without warning in October.

   A Colombian convicted of drug dealing
testified Friday that he gave ousted Panamanian leader Manuel
Noriega $4 million in cash for protection of a cocaine laboratory
to be built in Panama.
   Boris Olarte Morales has been a key prosecution witness in the
trial of fellow Colombian Jose Abello Silva, who is charged with
conspiracy to import drugs into the United States.
   Olarte, 27, who pleaded guilty in May 1987 and has been
cooperating with the government, said during defense
cross-examination that he was smuggling marijuana and cocaine in
1983 when he met Noriega and asked him about doing business. He
said he returned to Noriega's home a few weeks later.
   ``I told him there were some people interested in opening a
laboratory to process cocaine in his country and I asked him, was
it within his power to protect that operation,'' Olarte tetified.
   He said Noriega assured him he could provide protection.
   Olarte said he delivered $4 million in two large suitcases to
Noriega, and received 10 percent of the money for setting up the
operation.
   His payment of that bribe is cited in a 1988 indictment in
Florida accusing Noriega of drug conspiracy.
   Olarte said he returned to Panama in early 1984 to let Noriega
know that his backers were unhappy with the protection.
   ``The people that pay him through me to protect the operation in
Panama, they were kind of upset,'' Olarte said. ``I said, `You
supposed to be protecting the operation over there' and he didn't.
   ``He said he protected what he was to be protecting, but his
people was doing more than they were supposed to do.''
   Noriega is accused in the 1988 indictment of agreeing to permit
the Medellin cartel to establish and supply a cocaine laboratory in
Panama. The indictment says a dispute developed between members of
the cartel and Noriega over the seizure of that cocaine laboratory,
despite payment by members of the cartel.
   Olarte also testified during cross-examination Friday that he
gave a fellow Tulsa jail inmate $20,000 as a down payment for an
armed escape, in which armed mercenaries in helicopters were to
help him escape from jail. He said the other inmate never carried
through with the plan.
   Olarte was indicted in Tulsa in 1986 for conspiring to import
cocaine. He testified that after he tried to get out of jail, he
agreed to plead guilty and work for the government by May 1987.
   He said he then made a series of phone calls to drug partners in
Florida and Aruba in which Abello allegedly got involved in the
conspiracy.
   Abello was indicted in September 1987. He was arrested in
Colombia and extradited last October to face charges in Tulsa.

<HEAD>Court Orders Man Resentenced in Lottery Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania's state Superior Court
overturned two sentences against a man who pleaded guilty in 1988
to forging a bogus lottery ticket so he could win an unclaimed $15
million jackpot.
   The court said in an opinion issued Thursday that it agreed the
five- to 10-year concurrent sentences against Henry Arthur Rich on
conspiracy and forgery charges were ``an abuse of discretion.''
   The court ordered Rich to be resentenced on the charges.
   But it left intact a two- to four-year sentence for theft by
deception and a one- to two-year sentence for unlawful use of a
computer. Rich worked for a computer firm used by the Pennsylvania
Lottery.
   In an appeal, Rich argued the conspiracy and forgery sentences
exceeded guidelines set by the state, and the judge failed to
provide an explanation for the deviation as required during
sentencing in December 1988.
   Michael Moyle, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said
the decision was under review. He said the office might appeal to
the state Supreme Court or wait for the resentencing.
   During trial, prosecutors said Rich searched for high-value,
unclaimed tickets in the lottery system and printed a near-perfect
copy of a winning ticket from a July 1987 Super 7 jackpot.
   After forging the ticket, authorities said, Rich enlisted Mark
S. Herbst, a former video store clerk, to turn in the ticket. The
lottery awarded the first installment, nearly $470,000, but
officials detected the scam after noticing the ticket was not from
the location where it had been sold.
   Herbst, after pleading guilty to theft by deception and other
charges, was sentenced to a two- to four-year term.

   A British company accused of preparing steel tubes
to make a 131-foot-long gun for Iraq called the allegations absurd
Friday and said it had already shipped part of the order to Baghdad.
   Customs officers on Thursday seized eight sections of forged
steel tubing on the docks at Middlesbrough after a Ministry of
Defense expert said they could be used to build a weapon.
   Some arms experts said such a gun could hit Middle East targets
hundreds of miles away. Others doubt the tubes could be used to
make such a monster gun.
   ``There is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size. It is
definitely subject to export licensing controls,'' said Douglas
Tweddle, chief investigator for the Customs and Excise Office.
   Iraqi officials and the manufacturer, Sheffield Forgemasters,
say the tubing was intended for use in a petrochemical plant. The
company says the pipe sections were part of an assembly 511.8 feet
long.
   ``I am sure that most people will recognize the absurdity of
suggestions being made that these pipes are in fact guns,'' company
spokesman Tony Peck said.
   The company said it had two contracts for 26 sections each, and
had delivered 44 sections to the Ministry of Industry and Minerals
in Baghdad.
   Some weapons experts had said a gun with a barrel the size of
the tube seized by Customs _ 131 feet long with a 39-inch bore _
could fire nuclear or chemical warheads as far as Tehran or Tel
Aviv, each within 350 miles of Iraq's borders.
   ``If this is a gun we are probably going to have to rethink the
laws of physics,'' Ian Hogg, a former lecturer in ordnance design
and construction, told The Daily Telegraph. ``I can't see it
withstanding the interior explosion of the size necessary to push a
10-ton missile up a 40-meter tube.''
   ``If they did manage to get all the other necessary components I
wouldn't stand within a mile of the thing if they tried to fire it.
It would blow itself to pieces,'' said Phillip Wright, chief
executive of Sheffield Forgemasters.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who talked with President Bush
in Bermuda on Friday, said, ``The experts are still considering and
confirming as to whether it is a gun or simply large steel piping.
   ``They have not yet made up their minds if it is a gun.''
   Bush commended British intelligence and law enforcement agencies
for seizing the tubing shortly before it was to be shipped to Iraq.
   ``Anything we can do to keep guns or chemicals out of the hands
of terrorist nations, we should,'' he said.
   If it turns out the tubing was an illegal weapons export, ``I
would encourage and would offer our cooperation to guarantee a
total banning and firming up the ban of weapons or potential
weapons to countries that are illegally getting them.
   ``It is our purpose to keep such things out of the hands of the
Iraqi government,'' Bush said.
   Tweddle said it wasn't necessary yet to determine whether the
material was intended to be a gun, only that it could be used that
way and thus came within the provisions of Britain's embargo on
arms shipments to Iraq and Iran.
   ``The goods are now seized. Investigations will continue to
prove intent and to establish whether offenses have been
committed,'' he said.
   Britain banned all arms sales to Iraq and Iran after the
outbreak of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Despite the 1988
cease-fire, the embargo remains.
   The Independent newspaper reported in Friday editions the
manufacturing method _ ``of special pre-stressed, layered
compressed steel _ the `autofrettage' technique'' _ was the same
used to make gun barrels.
   The Times of London quoted an unidentified Customs official as
saying the seized materials matched a design by Gerald Bull, an
American arms expert found murdered in Brussels last month. Jane's
Defense Weekly has identified Bull as a designer of South Africa's
G5 155mm howitzer, which has been sold to Iraq.
   The Times quoted the Customs official as saying: ``The manual
describes precisely what we have got: the manufacturing process,
the methods, what it will fire, the length of the barrel,
everything. We are now absolutely certain that it is not only a
gun, but a gun made according to a Bull design.''
   A Customs spokesman could not be reached for comment on the Good
Friday holiday. No one answered the telephone at the agency's press
office.

   Arch A. Moore Jr., the patriarch of the
state Republican Party and former three-time governor, rode so high
for so long against political odds that many thought he would never
come down.
   But now federal prosecutors have him in a box. He has admitted
kickbacks, coverups and other crimes in office and agreed to
testify, possibly against other power brokers in West Virginia
politics.
   Moore's image began unraveling when he met secretly with his
former campaign manager in a Parkersburg parking lot three months
ago to discuss how they would both lie to a federal grand jury
investigating Moore, authorities said.
   The former governor told John F. Leaberry ``they would both
falsely deny to federal investigators and-or the grand jury that
there had been cash collected or used illegally,'' authorities said
in an indictment announced Thursday.
   They ``discussed the fact that approximately $35,000 in cash had
been collected by them or others during (Moore's) 1988 election
campaign,'' according to the indictment.
   Two days later, Moore denied to federal investigators that he
met with Leaberry or knew about the $35,000 in cash, authorities
said.
   He denied both incidents again in a meeting last Monday at the
U.S. attorney's office in Charleston, they said.
   That's when federal prosecutors revealed that Moore's
once-trusted aide wore a microphone for the U.S. Justice Department
during the parking lot meeting, and they had a tape of Moore's
words to Leaberry.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey says the recording of Moore's Jan. 8
conversation led directly to Moore's decision Thursday to agree to
plead guilty to five counts of extortion, tax fraud, mail fraud,
and obstruction of justice.
   ``The strength of our case caused him to plead guilty and the
tape was part of our case,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe
Savage.
   Federal authorities Friday refused to say why Leaberry, Moore's
1988 campaign manager and a former state official, wore the
recording device. They said only that Leaberry had been subpoenaed
to testify before the grand jury in Charleston.
   Leaberry's lawyer, John B. Carrico, said Leaberry was out of
town Friday but declined to comment further. ``I'm not at liberty
to discuss it,'' he said.
   Prosecutors said that, under the agreement with Moore signed
Thursday, he could be named in additional indictments as an
unindicted co-conspirator and he agreed to cooperate with federal
prosecutors in other investigations.
   The same officials would not elaborate Friday on how they
intended to use the ex-governor.
   ``It's premature to say he'll be testifying in any specific
trial,'' Savage said.
   However, the Charleston Daily Mail, quoting unidentified sources
Friday, reported that Moore will be a prosecution witness in the
trial of William T. Ellis, a limited partner in the Tri-State
Greyhound Park dog track in nearby Nitro.
   Ellis was indicted on charges of arranging a $100,000 bribe to
an unnamed state official and that official's political party.
   Moore was reached by telephone Friday in West Palm Beach, Fla.,
but he refused to talk to a reporter.
   Moore, who turns 67 Monday, is scheduled for arraignment April
26, authorities said. He faces up to 36 years in prison and up to
$1.25 million in fines.
   Moore served as governor from 1969 to 1977 and 1985 to 1989 and
was considered the dean of Republican politics in this strongly
Democratic state.
   He battled almost constantly with the Democratic-controlled
Legislature, but won voter approval of a constitutional amendment
giving the governor broad new power to set the state budget. Once
before, he had been indicted for wrongdoing in office but was
acquitted.
   Hours after Moore's indictment Thursday came another indictment
of former state Senate President Larry Tucker, charging the
Democrat with two counts of obstructing the Internal Revenue
Service, one count of lying to a grand jury and one count of
perjury.
   Tucker, who already has served half of a six-month federal
sentence, faces a maximum of 18 years in prison and $520,000 in
fines in connection with work he allegedly performed for a nursing
home.

   President Bush on Friday reassured
relatives of two Pan Am 103 victims that the United States is
committed to bringing to justice the terrorists who bombed the
plane.
   ``We will continue to do everything we can in cooperation with
the U.K. and other countries to get to the bottom of this cowardly,
dastardly incident,'' Bush said at the conclusion of a joint news
conference with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher said ``no one wants to solve that terrible tragedy
more than we do.''
   But ``we simply can't pull solutions out of the hat. It's a
question of patient, continuous work on that investigation and
patient, continuous determination to try to defeat terrorism.''
   Pan Am Flight 103, en route from London to New York, exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people on the
plane and 11 people on the ground were killed.
   Bert Ammerman of River Vale, N.J., and Dr. Jim Swire of
Bromsgrove, England, called on Bush and Mrs. Thatcher to issue a
communique condemning the attack and renewing their determination
to catch those responsible.
   ``As the leaders of the two greatest powers in the free world,
it is incumbent upon you to form the nucleus of a concentrated
effort to mobilize an effective global strategy to combat
terrorism,'' they said in a letter to Bush and Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``If the United States and the United Kingdom do not stand firm
on combating terrorism, but rather acquiesce to politically
expedient solutions, we will have compromised our nations' ethics.''
   Bush said the record of the United States and United Kingdom in
speaking out against terrorist acts was clear.
   ``But I don't think it hurts to reiterate our conviction that
these dastardly terrorist acts must stop.''
   He said the United States had ``formed a commission, and I know
great inquiry has gone on in the U.K.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said authorities had gotten ``quite a long way''
in the investigation, but that it wasn't completed.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she understands the frustrations of the
relatives.
   ``We, too, wish there were far less terrorism in the world,''
she said.
   Bush said: ``We understand and we do care,''

   Moslem militants on Friday kidnapped a
former member of the state legislature and Indian security forces
killed two Moslem demonstrators in Kashmir, news reports said.
   At least 269 people have been killed since a government
crackdown of Moslem separatists began in Kashmir in January. Most
of the victims were Moslem militants and their supporters who died
in clashes with the security forces or while defying curfew.
   Government troops intensified patrols after the former Congress
Party lawmaker, Amirullah Khan, was kidnapped by militants from his
home in Shopian, 37 miles northwest of Srinagar, a senior police
official said.
   Earlier this week, Moslem secessionists in Kashmir abducted and
killed three hostages, including a prominent educator.
   The kidnappers were demanding the freedom of three of their
jailed comrades.
   Indian troops shot and killed two Moslem demonstrators at
Bhaderwah, 120 miles north of Srinagar, after they attempted to
lead a procession following Moslem Friday prayers, officials said.
   On Thursday, gunfire broke out along the tense frontier of
Kashmir and one Indian soldier and five Pakistani troops were
killed, the New Delhi-based United News of India reported.
   In Islamabad, a spokesman for Pakistan's defense ministry said
he had no information of the shootout or any Pakistani casualties.
   ``There were no casualties on our side,'' said the spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But he added: ``Firing along the cease-fire line is a normal
phenomena. It happens almost every day.''
   The unresolved fate of Kashmir dates back to 1947 when Indian
and Moslem Pakistan were partitioned along religious lines. The old
princely state of Kashmir was predominantly Moslem, but its Hindu
ruler opted to join India. Today the Kashmir region is divided
between India and Pakistan along a disputed frontier and has twice
been the cause of war between them.
   The Indian part of Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in India with
a Moslem majority. Nationwide, Hindus form 82 percent of India's
880 million people, while Moslems comprise 12 percent.
   India has accused Pakistan of fomenting the secessionist
violence in Jammu-Kashmir.

   President Bush and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher urged Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Friday to call off his threatened economic sanctions
against breakaway Lithuania.
   ``Now is no time for escalation,'' Bush said after he and the
prime minister met for several hours of discussions. ``It is time
for talk'' between Moscow and the Lithuanians.
   Said Mrs. Thatcher, ``I abide by the statement the president
just made.''
   The president and the prime minister met with reporters hours
after the Soviet news agency Tass reported that Gorbachev had given
the Lithuanian government two days to rescind its
``anti-constitutional actions'' or face the imposition of sanctions.
   Bush traveled to Bermuda, at Mrs. Thatcher's invitation, to
discuss a variety of global issues _ including German unification,
NATO and the situation in Lithuania _ in advance of his meeting
next month with Gorbachev.
   The president said he would cooperate in tightening export laws
if British investigators determine that a seized load of tubing
destined for Iraq amounted to an illegal weapons shipment.
   Both emphasized their agreement on most issues particularly on
the position that a unified Germany should be a permanent member of
NATO.
   At a pre-dinner black tie reception with Mrs. Thatcher aboard
the British naval vessel HMS Arrow, the president plunged into a
crowd of 400 to 500 cheering bystanders to shake hands.
   Bush was to play golf Saturday before returning to Washington.
   The two leaders took a break from serious matters Friday to join
about 20 children in a Good Friday tradition of flying kites. The
Bermuda ritual was begun by teacher trying to explain to his
students Christ's ascension into heaven.
   Even as he criticized Gorbachev's threatened sanctions, Bush
welcomed as ``a positive statement'' the Soviet president's remark
to a delegation of U.S. senators on Thursday that the two leaders
might be able to initial an arms control pact when they meet in
Washington in six weeks.
   Bush said the ``slant'' of Gorbachev's remarks to the senators
was more encouraging than what he had heard from Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze when the two met last week.
   Reacting to a news agency report that Gorbachev had tightened
the pressure on Lithuania with the threat of an economic boycott,
Bush said there was little more the Western allies can do to stay
Gorbachev's hand without risking a break in East-West relations.
   ``I am troubled by it,'' the president said of the report,
adding that all he knew was what he had read in a brief dispatch
from Moscow.
   ``I know there is a great desire on the part of Americans to
know what we might do, what can be done,'' Bush said.
   But he said that even if he had a response he was not sure he
would make it public.
   ``The answer'' in Lithuania ``is dialogue and peaceful change,''
Bush said.
   Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked if the
administration had anything further to say about Lithuania. He
replied: ``No. Actually it is less certain now what happened. What
we are trying to do is sort out what happened and what it means.''
   Both Bush and Mrs. Thatcher reacted to Gorbachev's statement to
the visiting senators that he did not need further lectures from
outside about his policy toward the Lithuanian attempt to break
free of Soviet control.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she was ``not lecturing anyone'' but is
``entitled to express my view the problem cannot be solved by
force.''
   ``We have a duty to say what we think,'' she declared. She said
she thinks the situation should not be resolved by force.
   Bush said he felt he was ``on the rigt track'' in urging
Gorbachev to proceed with negotiations in lieu of using force.
   Mrs. Thatcher said British experts had not yet determined if a
shipment of metal tubing for Iraq _ halted Thursday at the last
moment _ contained the makings for an enormous gun barrel rather
than, as Iraq claimed, sections of pipeline.
   Bush praised the British for catching the shipment in time.
``There has been superb cooperation between the United States and
the United Kingdom in trying to avert breaches in the law,'' he
said.
   En route to Bermuda for his sixth meeting with the British
leader in his 15-month presidency, Bush welcomed Gorbachev's ``very
positive statement'' on the prospects for reaching a nuclear-arms
accord at next month's superpower summit.
   ``We are sending the same signals to our negotiators and
policy-makers,'' Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One.
   Earlier in the day, the president was greeted by the prime
minister under overcast skies at a breezy arrival ceremony on the
grounds of the 33-acre, oceanside Government House.
   After reviewing brightly uniformed and helmeted members of the
Bermuda Guard, the two leaders went inside for their meeting.
   In his remarks on the way to Bermuda, a self-ruling British
colony, the president said he was ``very upbeat'' about the
Thatcher meeting _ one of a series of three face-to-face,
pre-summit sessions with allied leaders.
   He met with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in Toronto on
Tuesday and plans to meet Thursday in Key Largo, Fla., with French
President Francois Mitterrand.
   The president said he welcomed Gorbachev's comments on
initialling a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) at their
Washington summit.
   ``I viewed that as a very positive statement,'' Bush said.
   He said he was eager to meet next week with Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, who headed the senatorial delegation that
met with Gorbachev.
   Bush shrugged off Gorbachev's comment to the senators cautioning
the United States against preaching to the Kremlin about Lithuania.
Moscow views the Baltic republic's March 11 declaration of
independence as illegal.
   ``I don't view that (Gorbachev's remarks) as a hostile comment,
but I view it as a reiteration of his well-known position'' that
the dispute in Lithuania is an internal Soviet matter, Bush said.
   By the same token, Bush added, ``I will continue to say what I
think on this subject.'' Bush has voiced his support for the
self-determination rights of Lithuanians but has urged restraint on
both sides.
   Asked if he feared that Soviet hard-liners advocating greater
use of force in Lithuania were gaining influence, Bush said:
   ``There is some speculation on that. ... But we cannot read the
tea leaves with total clarity when it comes to pressures inside the
Kremlin.''
   He also welcomed the East German government's public apology to
Jews for Nazi atrocities.
   ``I'm one who believes in forgiveness,'' the president said.
``And this is a good day for forgiveness.''
   He added:
   ``I'm inclined to think we ought to forgive, but not forget. I'm
a Christian. I think forgiveness is something I feel very strongly
about.''

<HEAD>Man Charged With Killing Six Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM CURRAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old man was charged Friday
with killing six of seven women strangled here since September and
with the assault Monday night of another woman whose attack was
interrupted by a passerby.
   The charges against Ray Shawn Jackson of Kansas City were
announced at a news conference held by police Chief Larry Joiner,
Jackson County Prosecutor Albert Riederer and Kansas City Mayor
Richard Berkley.
   Joiner said that the six strangled women had all been lured to
the areas where they were slain, in or near Gillham Park in
midtown, by the promise of obtaining crack cocaine.
   Many blacks have said authorities and the media failed to give
the case adequate attention because the victims were black
prostitutes and drug addicts. ``Gillham Park has become a death
trap for black women,'' Ron Finley, a member of the Ad Hoc Group
Against Crime, said before Jackson's arrest.
   The chief said the charges were the outcome of thousands of
hours of investigation that speeded up again last week after the
death of Michelle Mitchell, 22.
   Circulation of a composite drawing of a man believed to be a
suspect in her death produced more than 300 phone calls, Joiner
said. Detectives were told that Jackson, who is also black, matched
the description of the drawing and that he had been bragging about
killing a woman in Gillham Park.
   Joiner said officers found him at a relative's house where he
stayed periodically.
   The chief said Jackson had no history of violence or any prior
arrest record, but that it was his understanding he had used drugs.
   ``I don't think I can get into his motives,'' Joiner said.
   In addition to the killing of Miss Mitchell, whose body was
found on April 5, Jackson is charged with killing Annette Stewart,
33, whose body was found Sept. 16; Kimberly Creer, 22, found Sept.
20; Tresa Williams, 21, found Oct. 22; Janice Berryman, 36, found
Oct. 28; and Tonya Ward, 23, found Jan. 18.
   The investigation has not produced evidence linking Jackson to
the death of the seventh woman, Brenda McCoy, 33, who was found
Sept. 26, Joiner said.
   But the 27-year-old black woman assaulted on Monday night had
identified Jackson from a photograph as her assailant, he said.
   According to police statements, the woman said she was walking
on the street and noticed someone following her. She said he asked
to join her and she refused, and that later the man came at her
from behind, knocking her down and dragging her into some bushes
where he began choking her.
   The woman said the assailant was scared away by a man out
walking his dog.
   Jackson told detectives he killed the six women after offering
to get cocaine for them, according to police. He said he packed mud
in one woman's mouth, and removed his victims' clothing and
scattered it around after killing them.

   Hundreds of firefighters battled flames
Friday at a 36-story luxury hotel after a late-night blaze forced
the evacuation of more than 1,000 guests.
   No casualties were reported from the fire that started Thursday
night in the basement of the five-star Oberoi Towers Hotel,
Bombay's biggest. At one point, it appeared that most rooms were on
fire.
   Navy helicopters swooped low Friday to look for anyone who might
have been trapped. Firefighters equipped with oxygen tanks were
lowered onto the terrace to search the top 10 floors, but they
found no one.
   The firefighters had contained the fire to the basement Friday,
said Deputy Chief Fire Officer M.G. Sirkhot. White smoke billowed
from the building, which faces the Arabian Sea.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but one hotel
staffer said it was probably due to a short circuit in the basement.
   Authorities evacuated more than 1,000 guests from Oberoi Towers
and the adjacent Oberoi Hotel, placing them in other hotels in the
city.

   President Bush said Friday that he was
inclined to forgive the East Germans for their role in the murder
of millions of Jews during the Holocaust.
   The East German legislature accepted responsibility Thursday for
the Nazi atrocities during World War II and sought assurances of
forgiveness from Israel, the Soviet Union and Jews around the world.
   ``I'm one who believes in forgiveness,'' Bush told reporters
aboard Air Force One just before takeoff for Bermuda and his
one-day meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
``It's a good day for forgiveness for those of us who have faith.''
   In a statement received in Washington, the Simon Wiesenthal
Center of Los Angeles said the president's remark was ``morally
wrong and politically dangerous'' because ``the generation of
Germans who perpetrated the Holocaust can never be forgiven for
their heinous crimes.''
   ``Indeed, the only people who could have granted them
forgiveness perished in the gas chambers,'' the center said in a
statement.
   ``While the Jewish people do not hold those individuals born
after the Holocaust to be responsible for the crimes of their
forefathers, nonetheless the legacy of Auschwitz must be
permanently embedded into the conscience of the German nation,''
the statement said.
   The center is a private group devoted to education about the
Nazi murder of 6 million Jews and the capture of Nazi war criminals.
   Bush noted the start of the Easter weekend _ he attended a
sunrise Good Friday church service before leaving Washington.
   Asked about the service, Bush joked with reporters: ``We prayed
for you.''
   He turned more solemn when asked about East Germany and the
Holocaust.
   ``For our family, Easter is a very special time of year. And
it's a time to take stock and to be glad,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm a Christian,'' he said, ``and I think that forgiveness is
something that I feel very strongly about.''
   But while Bush advocated forgiveness he said the world should
not forget the Holocaust. ``You learn from history, what not to do
wrong, how to conduct oneself,'' he said.
   Bush said his feelings about forgiveness were a ``personal
observation. It's not a statement for our country.''
   In its statement, the East German parliament said, ``Nationalism
and racial madness led to genocide, particularly of the Jews in all
European countries, of the people of the Soviet Union, the Polish
people and the Gypsy people. Parliament ... admits joint
responsibility on behalf of the people for the humiliation,
expulsion and murder of Jewish women, men and children.''

   Residents of the north central United States
and central Canada may see a rainbow of colors in the night sky
before dawn on Easter Sunday if a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration proceeds as planned.
   NASA announced Saturday that the Pegsat satellite would release
a canister of barium at 1:36 a.m. EDT Sunday 362 miles above the
earth over northern Canada, between Churchill and Yellowknife, if
conditions are right for the test.
   The barium should form a yellowish cloud, which will change to
green and white, then fade while a purple streak grows vertically,
NASA said.
   The experiment is aimed at studying the interactions of the
barium with the electric and magnetic fields of the earth and with
other characteristics of space at that altitude, NASA said.
   Scientists at several sites in the United States and Canada will
be watching the barium cloud.
   The Pegsat satellite was released from the unique winged Pegasus
space vehicle launched from a B-52 on April 5.

<HEAD>Israeli Arrives In U.S. To Face Fraud Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli who was indicted by his government
for allegedly defrauding two U.S. banks of $6.1 million arrived in
New York from Israel and appeared before a federal magistrate
Friday.
   The case of Samuel Dagan marks the first time U.S. and Israeli
officials have cooperated to prosecute an Israeli accused of crimes
in this country, federal authorities said.
   Efforts to prosecute Dagan and his wife, Miriam K. Dagan, had
been hindered by an Israeli law that prevents its citizens from
being extradited to stand trial for crimes committed outside Israel.
   But following two years of negotiations between Israel and the
U.S. authorities, Israeli authorities charged the Dagans in
February with closely related charges in a 22-count indictment.
   Dagan, escorted by U.S. Marshals but not handcuffed, appeared
briefly before U.S. Magistrate Allyne Ross in Brooklyn Federal
Court in New York City.
   Dagan told Ross he understood that he was going to Hartford,
Conn., to be tried there on charges of defrauding the Connecticut
Bank and Trust Company and the Connecticut Savings Bank out of $6.1
million in 1987.
   He declined to comment on the case, telling reporters outside
the courtroom, ``I don't want to say anything now before the
trial.''
   A former West Hartford resident, Dagan agreed to return to the
United States voluntarily from Israel to be tried. His wife was
also charged in a federal indictment but decided to remain in
Israel, according to U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr.
   The Dagans, well-known business owners and prominent members of
West Hartford's Jewish community, fled the United States in March
1988, just before a warrant was issued for their arrest.
   The federal indictment, returned Aug. 23, 1988, in Hartford,
charged Dagan and his wife each with one count of conspiring to
defraud federally insured banks, nine counts of bank fraud and 16
counts of false statements to banks.
   The couple allegedly participated in a check-kiting scheme
involving accounts they had at both banks for local businesses they
operated, according to the indictment.
   Dagan's lawyer, public defender Lori Levinson, advised the court
Friday that Dagan recently underwent surgery and was in need of
medical care.
   After spending the weekend at a Hartford jail, he was scheduled
to appear Monday morning before a federal magistrate in Hartford.

   Thirty-five middle school students were
suspended for staging a sit-in when school administrators refused
to let them lower the school's flag in honor of AIDS victim Ryan
White.
   The students at Madison Middle School sat around the school
flagpole, saying they would not return to class until the American
flag was lowered to half-staff.
   The students' planned tribute Wednesday coincided with the day
of White's funeral in Indiana. The teen-ager, who was a
hemophiliac, died Sunday from AIDS-related complications. He had
contracted the disease from tainted blood products.
   When middle school officials declined to lower the flag the
morning of White's funeral, a number of students left their
classrooms and sat around the flagpole, school officials said.
   Assistant Principal Carl Ihle said officials were aware earlier
that students wanted to lower the flag. Administrators scheduled an
assembly to honor White Wednesday morning, but the students wanted
more, he said.
   After a flurry of calls by school officials, parents and
children to the Eugene school superintendent's office and to state
and federal offices, Superintendent Margaret Nichols said she made
the final decision not to lower the flag, based on the U.S. flag
code.
   Nichols said she did not have the authority to grant the
students permission to lower the flag. However, she said she
supported their right to disagree with the decision.
   ``It's kind of like a little metaphor for what it's like to be
an American,'' Nichols said. ``People make a decision you do or
don't like.''
   Students who refused to return to class were assessed a two-day
suspension, Ihle said.
   The school's refusal to lower the flag raised questions among
some parents.
   ``It's like we can burn the flag in protest, but our kids can't
lower it for 15 minutes. I don't get it,'' said Kathy Dennis, whose
daughter, Michelle, 13, was among those suspended.

   Two prisoners surrendered Friday at
Strangeways Prison, leaving fewer than 13 rebel inmates inside as
the prison revolt entered its 13th day, the Home Office said.
   Some of those still barricaded in the prison held up a sign to
reporters saying, ``We will come down on Sunday.''
   Solicitor Barry Cuttle, who has been acting as an independent
observer at negotiations between the remaining inmates and the
prison staff, said he had been hopeful the siege would end on Good
Friday.
   But he added: ``We have been hopeful for a long time and have
been let down and disappointed.''
   Several of the rebel inmates remained on the prison roof,
whistling and shouting to scores of spectators in the streets below.
   The standoff began April 1 when hundreds of prisoners rioted and
badly damaged the overcrowded Victorian prison. Several inmates who
surrendered earlier claimed they had seen dead bodies inside, but
others insisted there had been no deaths.
   One prisoner accused of sexually assaulting three children died
from injuries in the rioting and a prison guard died of a heart
attack.
   The prison held more than 1,500 inmates in the 900-capacity
facility at the time of the riot.

<TEXT>
   Convicted tax evader Leona Helmsley made
out a check for $42,065,000 to the Internal Revenue Service on
national television Friday to show she pays her taxes.
   Mrs. Helmsley said the sum will pay off the 1989 joint personal
income of her and her husband, real estate and hotel magnate Harry
Helmsley.
   ``And we've already paid $22 million, which brings it to a gross
of about $65 million for this year alone,'' she said.
   ``We paid our taxes in the past, we paid them now and we'll pay
them in the future,'' she said. ``I want the public to know that
we're good Americans.''
   Helmsley, wearing a white blouse, black slacks, black-and-gold
sandals and a gold necklace, also noted that she and her husband
have given $143 million to charity. In addition, she said, they
paid $29.7 million in New York city and state taxes.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, was convicted last year of federal income tax
fraud and sentenced to four years in prison, but is free on bond
pending appeal. She still faces state charges that she, her husband
and two former employees falsified $3 million worth of business and
tax records from 1982 to 1986.
   Her attorneys have asked that those charges be dismissed but the
judge has not yet ruled. Mrs. Helmsley faces up to four years in
state prison if convicted.
   Her 80-year-old husband was found mentally incompetent to stand
trial in federal court and is seeking the dismissal of state
charges on the same grounds.
   Mrs. Helmsley said she agreed to be videotaped by the syndicated
television program ``A Current Affair'' while vacationing at her
Harley Sandcastle hotel on Lido Key to show that she pays taxes
like everyone should. The segment aired later Friday.
   Mrs. Helmsley has steadfastly maintained she is innocent of tax
evasion. She said an appeal will be filed April 25 asking for a new
trial.
   ``We've had a very hard time,'' she said. ``It's been close to
five years of them persecuting us. ... It's constant badgering,
constant courtrooms, constant attorneys, constant pressure.''

<TEXT>
   A Greyhound bus was discovered parked near
railroad tracks Friday, its engine still running, and police said
it apparently was abandoned after a failed attempt to park it
across the tracks.
   Officials of strike-bound Greyhound Lines Inc. had not reported
the bus missing when police patrolling the suburb west of Chicago
found it about 1:30 a.m., said Maywood Police Sgt. Donald Mobley.
   The bus was about 2 feet from the tracks.
   ``Apparently, they were trying to get it onto the tracks, but it
got stuck on the rocks near the tracks and whoever brought it there
abandoned it,'' Mobley said.
   Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office and maintenance
workers walked out March 2 in an argument over wages and job
security. The company has been operating a reduced schedule since,
using permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross picket
lines.
   Greyhound has reported more than 30 shooting attacks on its
buses, 70 bomb threats, and more than 100 incidents of violence.
   One picketing driver, Robert Waterhouse, 59, died when he was
crushed by a bus driven by a replacement driver in Redding, Calif.
The dead man's son, Bob Waterhouse Jr. of Wenatchee, Wash.,
picketed the Greyhound depot in his home town of Wenatchee, Wash.,
on Thursday in protest after a Shasta County, Calif., district
attorney decided not to charge the driver of the bus.
   Bill Pearsall, an official of the Amalgamated Transit Union in
Chicago, said strikers had nothing to do with the bus'
disappearance.
   The bus arrived in Chicago on Thursday from Milwaukee, said
Greyhound spokesman Bill Kula.
   The driver was told to drive another bus back to Milwaukee and
another driver was supposed to take the bus to the garage for
servicing. ``Somehow or another that didn't happen,'' said Kula.
``The wires got crossed.''
   Someone started it and drove off unseen Between 8 p.m. and 12
a.m., Kula said.
   To prevent similar incidents in the future, Greyhound is
requiring drivers in Chicago to show photo identification cards
before they leave the terminal, Kula said.
   Elsewhere, a New York state judge signed an order Friday barring
Greyhound from employing ``strikebreakers'' within New York City,
but attorneys for striking workers said it was doubtful the order
would be followed. The order did not spell out any penalties or
sanctions against Greyhound if it failed to comply.
   Acting state Supreme Court Justice Diane Lebedeff actually
granted the temporary restraining order verbally last week, basing
it on an anti-strikebreaking statute passed by the City Council in
1962 but never before applied.
   Lebedeff also allowed Ronald L. Kuby, an attorney for Local 1202
of the Amalgamated Transit Union, and co-counsel William Kunstler
to take depositions of Greyhound drivers in New York City.
   Kunstler, the noted civil rights attorney, said the interviews
would allow the unions to learn if replacement workers have
criminal records, bad driving histories or if they received bonuses
to work for Greyhound.
   ``Our effort will be to show they're really hiring bums in order
to break the union,'' he said.

   Lifting a slender, 5-foot-high cross before him,
Pope John Paul II led a torchlight procession through the Colosseum
Friday night to re-enact Jesus' march to his crucifixion.
   Thousands of people bearing candles in red paper cones watched
the Good Friday ceremony, broadcast to millions throughout the
world.
   The ceremony was one of several worldwide that marked Good
Friday. Thousands of pilgrims retraced the traditional procession
route through Jerusalem's Old City, and hundreds of thousands of
Roman Catholics turned out for the 146th annual re-enactment of the
crucifixion at an ancient Indian ceremonial site in Mexico.
   In the Philippines, more than 20 Filipino penitents were nailed
to crosses today, and others whipped themselves bloody as Asia's
only predominantly Christian nation marked the crucifixion. The
penitents were nailed to the crosses for up to 10 minutes.
   Traffic jams snared holidary travelers in East and West Germany.
   For the first time, the ceremony in Rome was transmitted to the
Soviet Union, the state-owned Italian RAI network said.
   ``All of us who belong to the priestly people of the new
covenant gaze upon the cross, with veneration and recollection,''
John Paul said in a brief address in Italian at the end of the
procession of the Via Crucis, or Way of the Cross.
   ``We draw nourishment from the impenetrable mystery, which human
words cannot describe.''
   The procession, from the Colosseum to the edge of the ancient
Roman Forum, evoked the tortures Jesus suffered as he made his way
to his crucifixion on Calvary Hill in Jerusalem.
   At each of the 14 stops representing the stages of Jesus'
suffering, men and women read meditations written by the Latin
Patriarch of Jerusalem, Michel Sabbah. They asked for spiritual
blessings for modern Christians.
   The pope, wearing white robes and a crimson cape trimmed with
gold, carried before him a slender black cross made of lightweight
wood. He was followed by two men bearing torches and a group of
cardinals and other priests.
   Thousands of nuns, tourists and Romans outside the Colosseum
prayed and sang in Latin as the pope walked slowly between the
stations. A large cross made of candles flickered inside the
Colosseum.
   The Good Friday ceremonies mark the most solemn day of the year
for Christians, who celebrate Jesus' resurrection on Easter Sunday.
   The papal tradition of marking the Way of the Cross was revived
in 1964 by Pope Paul VI after an interruption of nearly a century
following the creation of the modern Italian state.
   Among the 14 Stations of the Cross are stops marking the three
times Jesus stumbles and falls under the weight of the cross.
   In a Good Friday message issued earlier to Maronite Catholic
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, the pope appealed anew for a halt to the
``fratricidal'' fighting in Lebanon.
   ``The drama of Lebanon must end ... Lebanon must live again,''
said the telegram, which came on the 15th anniversary of the start
of Lebanon's civil war.
   The pontiff also celebrated a ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica
Friday afternoon marking Jesus' sacrifice. He prayed for a variety
of groups, including Jews. ``May the Lord our God, who once spoke
to their (the Jews') fathers, help them to always advance in the
love of his name and in faithfulness to his alliance,'' the pope
said.
   Catholic Church policy toward Jews underwent a major change with
the 1965 document Nostra Aetate, which officially refuted the
charge that Jews bore collective responsibility for killing Jesus.
   Just after noon, John Paul heard the confessions of 12 pilgrims
in St. Peter's Basilica, continuing a Good Friday tradition he
began 11 years ago to emphasize the importance of the sacrament.
   The pope will celebrate the Easter Vigil Saturday night,
followed by an open-air Mass on Easter Sunday in St. Peter's Square.

<HEAD>IRA Asks Canadian Company to Hire More Catholics in Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city councillor from Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army, arrived in Montreal from
Northern Ireland to demand that Belfast's main employer, a
Canadian-owned company, hires more Catholics.
   Pat Rice, a councillor in the Belfast suburb of Lisburn, began a
series of meetings Friday to persuade the Montreal-based Bombardier
Inc. to hire more Catholics at its Short Brothers PLC aircraft and
missile manufacturing subsidiary.
   Bombardier bought the sprawling company, which employs 7,000,
from the British government in October for $60 million.
   Since June, when the purchase was announced, the IRA has bombed
Short four times to protest what it called job discrimination. No
one has been injured in the bombings.
   Rice said the IRA bombings of the Short plant were ``not the
ideal background for my visit.''
   ``But I can see certain advantages, if you like, as a shot
across the bow to Bombardier about a problem which they have
inherited,'' he said.
   Rice said just 11 percent of Short's workforce is Catholic,
although Catholics make up 36 percent of Northern Ireland's
population.
   ``Short ... has always been a symbol of discrimination,'' he
said.
   Bombardier officials were unavailable for comment Friday.
   But in a recent interview, Bombardier spokesman Yvon Turcot said
the IRA had the ``wrong address'' in bombing the plant.
   He said Short had a strong record in recruiting Catholic workers
and ``Bombardier is certainly not going to jeopardize that record.''
   Rice said that Bombardier has ``expressed good intentions about
hiring Catholics.''
   But he added: ``We have an expression in Ireland: `Words don't
feed the brethren.'''

<HEAD>Northrop Plans B-2 Cutbacks To Make Program More Politically
Palatable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. has launched a cost-cutting
program to protect the $75 billion stealth bomber program,
including layoffs, a trimmed inspection program and reduced
security, a spokesman said Friday.
   ``We have a cost-reduction effort,'' said Northrop spokesman
Tony Cantafio, but he noted the reductions were part of a
long-planned, companywide effort to trim expenses.
   ``We are streamlining throughout the company. Last year we
announced that this kind of undertaking would take place throughout
the company,'' Cantafio said.
   In addition to cost cuts, Northrop documents show the company
also aims to boost profits on the so-far anemic B-2 program,
increasing its goal from a 6 percent profit margin this year to 9
percent.
   The expensive stealth bomber program has been facing stiff
congressional criticism.
   ``The public debate has been on the cost,'' said Oliver Boileau,
stealth division president. ``It is prudent for management to
always try to drive costs down. We are doing our part.''
   Cantafio said delaying the program adds to cost.
   ``These are the things we are doing in the factory to cut costs.
The big thing with the B-2 is the rate (at which) we build them,''
he said.
   Though the company has not set a cost-reduction goal, Boileau
said the current reductions should do enough to lower the overall
cost of the program.
   Among the steps is laying off as many as 500 of the 12,000
Northrop B-2 employees at the stealth operations in Pico Rivera and
Palmdale. The final number of layoffs is being worked out, Boileau
said.
   ``We had peak employment of 14,500 during development of the B-2
and now we are at 12,000, but we will also be hiring in Palmdale,''
said Cantafio. ``They are in a transition from development to
full-scale production.
   ``Some positions will be eliminated, but others will be
created.''
   Led by California Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, critics of the
B-2 contend the per-plane cost could run as high as $1.95 billion
if the government cuts back on its plan to buy 132 bombers.
   Another cost-cutting step involves reducing security, a
high-price item on a program as highly classified as the B-2. For
years, the company would not even admit the program existed.
   ``Security requirements have been reduced as far as the
government wants to go,'' Boileau said.
   Other measures include having factory employees inspect some of
their own work, consolidating three computer centers into two,
cutting travel expenses and reducing outside contracting for labor.

<HEAD>Ore., Calif., Ariz. Grocery Chains Announce Enviro Certification</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four western grocery chains said Friday they
would try to help consumers cut through deceptive environmental
advertising.
   Manufacturers will be asked to verify their product claims with
third-party certification under the program announced Friday by
Fred Meyer Inc. of Portland, Ore., Raley's of Sacramento, Calif.,
Ralphs Grocery Co. of Compton, Calif., and ABCO Markets Inc. of
Phoenix, Ariz.
   Companies that can prove their claims and use significant levels
of recycled material in their products and packaging will receive a
special label for their product called the Green Cross Recycling
Seal of Approval.
   Another label, the Green Cross Environmental Seal of Approval,
will be granted to companies that meet even stricter recycling
standards, adopt aggressive solid waste reduction policies and
adhere to ``zero tolerance'' production standards for emissions of
any materials that cause cancer or are capable of causing
reproductive harm.
   Signs will be posted in stores to alert customers to products
with the seals of approval.
   ``We want to send the message to manufacturers of products that
environmental concern is not some passing fancy,'' said Fred Meyer
spokesman Rob Boley.
   ``Unfortunately, there are a few companies that are relying on
Madison Avenue to develop their environmental policy,'' said Craig
Merrilees of the National Toxics Campaign, who said the four chains
``deserve our support and praise.''
   Fred Meyer operates 125 stores in seven Western states. ABCO has
75 supermarkets in Arizona. Ralphs operates 143 stores in southern
California and Raley's has 58 stores in northern California and
northern Nevada.

<HEAD>Poll Says Cincinnatians Support Mapplethorpe Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Cincinnati residents believe an art
gallery should be allowed to show Robert Mapplethorpe's
controversial photographs, according to a poll published Friday by
The Cincinnati Post.
   The poll of 561 adults in Hamilton County found that 59 percent
support the Contemporary Arts Center in displaying the photographs.
The art gallery and is director were indicted one week ago on
misdemeanor obscenity charges for displaying seven photos that show
naked children or homoerotic acts.
   County Prosecutor Arthur Ney Jr. tried to get the seven
photographs voluntarily removed following the indictments, but a
federal judge granted the art gallery a protective order
prohibiting authorities from interfering with the show.
   Prosecutors will have to convince a jury that the photos violate
community standards in order to get an obscenity conviction.
   The poll, conducted by the Institute for Policy Research on
behalf of the newspaper, found that ``a substantial majority wants
the photos to be shown,'' said Al Tuchfarber, who directed the
survey at the institute.
   Roughly 38 percent said the photographs shouldn't be shown, and
3 percent had no opinion.
   Support for the show came from all demographic groups,
Tuchfarber said. The strongest opposition came from the elderly and
those who haven't attended college.
   Younger residents tended to support the art gallery, and men
favored the exhibition in larger numbers than did women, the poll
found.
   Religion appeared to play no major role _ a majority of
Catholics (56 percent) and Protestants (57 percent) supported it.
   ``These numbers shatter the myth that this is a heavily
conservative community,'' Tuchfarber said.
   The telephone survey was conducted last Wednesday and Thursday.
It has a margin for error of 4 percent.
   Roughly 96 percent of those who were surveyed had seen, read or
heard about the exhibit.
   ``That number is absolutely phenomenal for an issue like this,''
Tuchfarber said.
   On another question, about 55 percent said the government and
courts should have no role in determining what is displayed at art
museums. About 42 percent said they'd support government
involvement if displays ``seriously offend community standards.''
   In a related development Friday, Mayor Charles Luken accused
Ney, the county prosecutor, of backing out of the obscenity case
because he doubted he could win.
   Ney on Thursday transferred the case to the city prosecutor's
office, saying his office couldn't handle the case because the
charges involved were only misdemeanors.
   ``I think this is a politically hot potato, and the reason Mr.
Ney is doing this is that he doesn't feel he can win,'' Luken said.
   Ney's assistant, Chip Gerhardt, denied the accusation. Gerhardt
said Ohio law prohibits Ney's office from prosecuting misdemeanors.
   ``The law is clear on this, and Mr. Luken's a lawyer and he
should understand the law,'' Gerhardt said.

   Several hundred Islamic fundamentalists
attacked a city theater to stop a music concert, and several dozen
people were injured in the melee, the official news agency reported
Friday.
   The confrontation late Wednesday night at the Atlas Hall in the
capital's Bab el-Oued district was the latest of several such
incidents.
   There were few details on the violence, but the concert
reportedly involved a music group of Kabyles, a Berber group that
has long had friction with Arabs. The official APS news agency said
20 people were arrested following the attack on the theater, which
is near a mosque. It said the injured included eight policemen.
   A spokesman for the Islamic Salvation Front, a fundamentalist
party, claimed the incident was the work of an unidentified ``third
force'' trying to discredit fundamentalists. Witnesses, however,
blamed Islamic fundamentalists.
   The fundamentalists are expected to make gains in regional
elections June 12 in this North African country.

   A police officer sent to a shooting at a

   Judy Gillette critically wounded the owner, Shari Carrano,

Carrano was in critical condition Friday at St. Vincent's Medical
Center in Bridgeport, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Lt. Terry Gillette, a 24-year veteran of the police force and
the shift commander on Thursday, was led away from the scene by
another officer and is in seclusion, Police Chief Robert Wesche

   ``He did not know until he got there,'' Wesche said. ``He got

   Police said they did not have a motive for the shooting.
   Authorities said Mrs. Gillette walked into The Only One beauty
salon Thursday morning and asked Carrano for an appointment.
   When the owner sat down, Mrs. Gillette pulled out a gun and shot
Carrano in the eye before turning the gun on herself, Wesche said.
   Mrs. Gillette, 56, died a short time later.
   Detective Sgt. Normand Mercier said there was no argument
between the two women and that police had no knowledge of any feud
between them.

   Thousands of loggers and mill workers
jammed a downtown square Friday to protest the movement to remove
large tracts of timber from logging production to save forest owls.
   Some 8,000 to 10,000 people protested an emerging national
policy to limit logging the last of the never-cut timber in the
Pacific Northwest. Timber families fear they will be ignored by
policy-makers from outside the region.
   Environmentalists argue that the old growth timber must be
protected to save the northern spotted owl from extinction. They
say the owl cannot survive outside the complex ecosystem anchored
by centuries-old trees.
   ``I know we care for our forests,'' said Audrey Barnes, whose
family's ties to the timber industry stretch back three
generations. ``I know we can live with nature and nature with us.''
   Organizers said 350 businesses around the state closed so their
employees could attend. Some schools excused students so they could
join their families at the hourlong rally at Pioneer Courthouse
Square.
   Douglas County officials gave 25 to 30 local government
employees the day off with pay; about 105 businesses closed and 500
people came from the major mill town of Sweet Home.
   Bob and Susan Kasting, owners of the Busy Bee restaurant in
Sweet Home, said shutting down the timber industry would devastate
his business.
   ``If they can't work, they can't eat,'' he said.
   Republican Sen. Bob Packwood said he had run out of patience
with environmentalists seeking to end all logging in the state. He
told the crowd that their efforts could be condensed into two
words: ``No jobs.''
   ``You and I know we can have jobs forever,'' Packwood said.
   Coalition member Evelyn Badger said Congress would be asked to
set aside forest land specifically for timber harvests.
   ``We are the dirty-hands people who feed, clothe and shelter
this nation,'' she said.
   Environmentalist Mari Hoffman from Vancouver, Wash., who carried
a sign advocating protection for old growth, said she thought the
timber industry had forced the debate over logging by over-cutting
the Northwest woods.
   ``We're not opposed to logging,'' she said. ``We're just opposed
to the amount of logging that's taking place.''

   Former U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles, the
latest candidate in the Democratic gubernatorial field,
acknowledges he is being treated for depression but his opponents
Friday shied away from making it an issue.
   Chiles, 60, readily admitted Thursday that he has been treated
for the past year with Prozac, a revolutionary but expensive new
anti-depressant drug that came onto the market in late 1987.
   ``I wish I had known about Prozac earlier because it has helped
me,'' said Chiles, who said his condition stemmed partly from his
retirement from the Senate in January 1989.
   ``I've had depression and sought treatment,'' Chiles told The
Palm Beach Post in a telephone interview Thursday. The Post
attributed the initial report about his ailment to unidentified
``Republican officials,'' but GOP officials Friday distanced
themselves from the report.
   ``I think I was depressed about what was going on in the
state,'' joked Chiles, who said he takes one pill a day and feels
great. ``Now I'm going to do something about it.''
   Chiles said in a telephone interview Friday his treatment is
near completion.
   ``I think I'm finishing up,'' Chiles said. ``It has really
helped me. I really feel great.''
   Spokesmen for Chiles' two Democratic opponents said their
candidates were healthy and that Chiles' depression was not
presently an issue.
   ``We're not making it an issue, certainly at this stage'' said
Don Pride, press secretary for U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson, who had been
considered the Democratic frontrunner until Chiles' entry.
   However, Pride said Chiles' decision to leave the Senate after
his third term because the senator claimed to be ``burned out'' was
an issue.
   Prozac, which costs between $1.25 and $1.60 a pill, is the most
frequently prescribed anti-depressant in the country. Physicians in
the United States write or renew about 650,000 Prozac prescriptions
each month, according to published reports.
   A Tampa pyschiatrist, Walter Field, said it would be
``disgraceful and irresponsible'' if someone questioned Chiles'
abilities because he is taking Prozac.
   Brian Ballard, operations director for Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez, commented, ``Using this as an issue is not something
we're going to do.
   ``The governor is saying it's up to the Democrats to decide
whether that is an issue or not,'' said Ballard. ``I know the
governor does not think the campaign is based on that type of
thing. He wants to talk about the issues.''
   The governor's campaign manager, J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich, said
there isn't enough information available on the seriousness of the
illness.
   ``We're not going to make it an issue now,'' said Stipanovich.
``We're waiting for a nominee.''
   Scott Sokol, communications and political director for Democrat
George Stuart's campaign, said Chiles' medical standing was a
private matter and should not be available for public examination.
   Aides for Martinez, Stuart and Nelson said all three would make
their candidates' medical records available.
   Nelson breezed through a complete NASA physical and mental
checkup in September 1985 preceding his flight with space shuttle
Columbia in January 1986, Pride said.

   Two men being held on handgun charges in New
York have been charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of a
Maryland state trooper, state police said Thursday.
   Eric Tirado, 26, and Francisco Rodriguez, 20, both from New
York, were already being held in the Bronx House of Detention on
unrelated charges when they were served with the first-degree
murder warrants Thursday, police spokesman Chuck Jackson said.
   Tirado and Rodriguez were awaiting extradition Thursday night,
Jackson said.
   Cpl. Eric Wolf, 40, was shot to death March 29 after making a
traffic stop on Interstate 95 near Jessup. His body was found
slumped over in the driver's seat by an off-duty Washington
policeman who stopped to investigate why the police car was parked
on the side of the highway.
   State Police Superintendent Col. Elmer Tippett said the warrants
were based on ``forensic evidence developed at the crime scene.''
He refused to offer further details because the investigation was
continuing.
   Upon extradition to Maryland, Tirado and Rodriguez will be
charged with first-degree murder, use of a handgun in the
commission of a felony and possession of a handgun, Jackson said.

   Environmental groups predicted the move by companies selling the

used to catch schools of tuna.
   StarKist Seafood Co. said Thursday it ``will not purchase any

   The action was taken in ``recognition of increased consumer

   U.S. attorney Daniel Lopez Romo said late Thursday that the
money was believed inside drums dug up two weeks ago in a farmer's

   Lopez said officials became suspicious after residents began

   Authorities found one drum with $1.5 million still inside but
others had been emptied, he said. Newspapers said between 10 and 11
empty drums were found nearby.

<TEXT>
   Arms reduction may be the order of the
day for the superpowers, but India's drive to become the next
military giant has scuttled hopes of a ``peace dividend'' in
economically strapped South Asia.
   India's neighbors, especially Pakistan, are following its lead
in the buildup. Western military analysts and Indian intellectuals
fear another chapter of an expensive regional arms race is about to
begin.
   While the Soviet Union withdraws troops from Eastern Europe and
the United States plans defense cuts, The Indian defense budget for
1990 is more than 10 percent above last year.
   Between 1985 and 1989, India bought more weapons abroad _ $17.3
billion worth _ than any country in the world.
   In response, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan of Pakistan said his
country would continue stockpiling advanced weapons. Pakistan
already allocates 52 percent of its $6.8 billion federal budget to
defense.
   China recently announced a defense spending increase of 15.2
percent over 1989.
   ``There will be no peace dividend in South Asia,'' said Ian
Anthony, an expert on the Indian military at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute in Sweden. ``India thinks a
strong military will give it international prestige. I think
they've got it wrong.''
   Anthony and other Western military analysts say India is the
engine driving the regional arms buildup. More important than
recent tensions with Pakistan, they say, is India's desire to
achieve military might.
   ``India already has enough troops to smother Pakistan in a
protracted war,'' said a Western military official in New Delhi.
``They have their sights on a long-term military role.''
   Western economists and Indian intellectuals say the buildup
harms the Indian economy and those of other developing nations in
the region.
   Pakistan's per capita gross national product of just $350 a year
is the highest in the region, and it faces a host of domestic
problems that include a burgeoning drug trade and ethnic violence.
   Bangladesh and Nepal, two of the poorest countries in the world,
spend large amounts of their foreign exchange on weapons.
   Some say India seeks entry into the world military club for
reasons of pride.
   ``Weaklings are not honored; we want to be strong,'' A.P.J.
Abdul Kalam, father of India's intermediate-range ballistic
missile, said soon after the rocket's test firing in May 1989.
   Others feel India wants to assume the role its former colonial
masters, the British, once played in South Asia. India is not
seeking to colonize the region, they say, but wants to be viewed as
its protector.
   ``The British dominated the subcontinent. They guaranteed its
security,'' said Giri Deshingkar, director of the Center for the
Study of Developing Societies. ``India's military wants to do the
same.''
   The fall of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi late last year led
development experts to feel the defense budget, which has risen 400
percent in a decade, might be reduced.
   Troubles with Pakistan strengthened the military lobby, experts
said, and hopes that Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government would
devote more money to education and health soon evaporated.
   On March 19, the new government announced a 10.5 percent
increase in defense spending to $9.3 billion. Most of the extra
money went for weapons.
   Adm. J.G. Nadkarni argued in a speech last month that military
might, not economic development, was the key to power.
   ``There are few things that India can do that can get this
country greater leverage with the great powers than interfere with
their plans,'' said Nadkarni, chief of the naval staff.
   The mere capability to interfere with superpower movement in
international waters, he said, would cause them to think twice
about crossing India diplomatically.
   ``It's basic gunboat diplomacy,'' a Western military officer
said. ``We don't think it will work.''
   With 1.4 million men, India's military is the fourth largest in
the world, after the Soviet Union, China and United States. The air
force has 870 planes and is third behind Moscow and Washington in
heavy combat airlift capacity.
   India has built a ``blue water navy,'' including two aircraft
carriers with British-made Harrier jets.
   In 1988, a Soviet-made nuclear submarine joined India's 16
conventional subs.
   Since independence from Britain in 1947, India's soldiers, not
its diplomats, have played the key role in most foreign policy
crises.
   A border dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir led to war in 1948
and again in 1965. In 1971, Indian military intervention in the
Pakistani civil war helped create the new nation of Bangladesh from
East Pakistan.
   India annexed Goa, a Portuguese colony on its western coast, in
1961 by sending in the army.
   The next year, a border dispute with China brought India its
only major defeat. China seized 38,000 square kilometers (15,000
square miles) during the short war. Middle-aged Indians still talk
about the humiliation.
   Most recently, Indian troops spent 32 months trying to quell a
guerrilla uprising in Sri Lanka, the island nation off its southern
coast. The last troops withdrew March 24.
   In November 1988, Indian paratroopers thwarted an attempted coup
in the Maldives. During a recent trade dispute with landlocked
Nepal, India closed 13 of the 15 border crossings and curtailed the
passage of essential goods.
   A bloody escalation of the independence movement in India's part
of Kashmir has prompted saber-rattling toward Pakistan, which India
accuses of financing and arming Moslem separatists. Pakistan denies
the charge.
   The commitment to military growth could be weakening the
economy. In the 1960s, India was about 15th in per capita
industrial output, but now it's about 30th, according to United
Nations figures.
   Arms purchas have contributed to a foreign debt of more than $63
billion, fourth largest in the world.
   Reliance on force is ironic in the nation that gave the world
Mohandas K. Gandhi and his philosophy of non-violent political
struggle, said Bhabani Sen Gupta, a leading social scientist.
   ``The rest of the world is changing, but we refuse to do so,''
he said. ``We are obsessed with the sound of our shotguns.''

   An unrepentant Charles Diggs Jr.
is seeking a political comeback a decade after leaving Congress in
disgrace, hoping voters will remember his accomplishments more than
the kickback scandal that forced him from office.
   ``That happened 10 years ago,'' said Diggs, who is running for
the Maryland Legislature. ``And we fought it right to the end. If
that case had been brought up today it would have been thrown out.
Should have been thrown out then.''
   Diggs, a Democrat who represented Michigan in the U.S. House for
25 years, said he does not view his candidacy for the Maryland
House of Delegates as a launching pad for a return to Congress.
   In fact, he said he wants to serve just one four-year term as a
state lawmaker so he can help redraw Maryland's political district
lines, a process blacks hope will boost their numbers in the
legislature and Congress.
   ``Blacks are very underrepresented in several areas in this
state,'' Diggs said. ``I have been through redistricting in
Michigan. There's negotiation, give and take, and I would be
lending my experience to a situation that needs a remedy.''
   He was involved in Michigan reapportionment negotiations that
followed the 1960 census. After the state's House boundaries were
realigned, Michigan became the first state since Reconstruction
with two black congressmen.
   Diggs, one of five Democrats seeking three delegate slots in
Maryland's 26th House District, now runs a funeral business in
suburban Prince George's County outside Washington. He said people
in his district have not discouraged him from running because of
his past legal troubles.
   Diggs, 67, claimed he was a victim of selective prosecution and
double standards when he was indicted in 1978 on charges of mail
fraud and skimming $66,000 from his staffers' padded paychecks.
   It was a position he maintained throughout a trial that produced
guilty verdicts on all 29 counts, a lengthy congressional inquiry
that ended with a formal censure, a six-month prison term and
ensuing years of financial and legal trouble.
   He offers the same defense even now, saying he was dealt with
more harshly than other lawmakers accused of ethical
transgressions. He believes his outspoken criticism of U.S. policy
toward Africa was one reason.
   ``I was the biggest anti-South African around,'' Diggs said.
``They were very upset with me, didn't allow me in the country for
a long time. There was a lot of speculation that people were trying
to derail me because of the influence I was exerting regarding
Africa.''
   It was nearly 40 years ago that Diggs launched his political
career by winning a term in the Michigan Legislature.
   He went on to become one of the nation's most powerful black
officials, founding the Congressional Black Caucus and chairing the
House subcommittee on Africa and the committee that oversees the
District of Columbia.
   John Kotelly, the former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted
Diggs, said it was up to the voters to decide whether to give him
another chance.
   ``It's ancient history,'' said Kotelly, now a private attorney
in Washington. ``I don't believe that anybody has to wear sackcloth
forever after being convicted.''
   Diggs was born into a politically active Detroit family in 1922.
His father, Charles Diggs Sr., was a wealthy funeral home director
and real estate investor and the first man in town to sell blacks
coffins made of material other than wood.
   The younger Diggs entered the family business and was elected a
Michigan legislator in 1950. Four years later, he won the first of
13 terms in Congress, where his influence grew as he gained
seniority.
   A federal grand jury indicted Diggs on kickback charges in 1978.
He was convicted on all counts but won re-election a month later
and continued serving in Congress while his sentence was appealed.
   In June 1979, a Republican-led effort to expel Diggs from the
House failed by eight votes. A month later, he stood silently at
the front of the House chamber as his formal censure was read.
   Diggs resigned from Congress in June 1980 after the Supreme
Court declined to hear his appeal.
   Over the next several years he fought to regain his mortician's
licenses in several states, clashed with the Treasury Department
over payment of his court-ordered fine, and was charged with
drunken driving three times.
   He also graduated from Howard University, more than 40 years
after leaving college to serve in World War II.
   Diggs, who lives almost within view of Capitol Hill, said he
doesn't miss his days in Congress.
   ``When I drive by or see it on TV, it's almost like an old
dream,'' he said. ``It's part of my experience but I don't sit
around crying about it.''

<TEXT>
   Ninety years after James Weldon
Johnson wrote ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' for a group of school
children, the song known as the ``Black National Anthem'' has been
given new life by a group of well-known artists and singers.
   The recording, recently released as a single by Capitol Records,
features such artists as Stevie Wonder, Anita Baker, Bobby Brown,
Jeffrey Osbourne and Dionne Warwick. Each artist has a solo on the
recording, similar to the format used by Quincy Jones on the hit
``We Are the World'' record.
   Melba Moore, the Tony Award-winning actress and singer, was the
creative force behind the new recording of the song written by
Johnson, a lawyer, educator and civil rights leader who was born in
Jacksonville. Two versions of the song are included on her new
``Soul Exposed'' LP.
   Moore recently talked about the project in an interview.
   ``The original was really a hymn. The new one has a contemporary
sound. It sounds like a love song,'' Moore said.
   She said she told BeBe Winans about her idea to enlist the help
of other artists, and the gospel Grammy winner quickly contacted
musicians and singers and even took a sound engineer on the road to
record celebrities' voices for the recording.
   Also appearing on the record are Freddie Jackson, Take 6, Howard
Hewett, Stephanie Mills, BeBe and CeCe Winans, the Clark Sisters,
Terri Lynne Carrington and Gerald Albright.
   On the longer version of the song, the Rev. Jesse Jackson also
participates. In addition, actress and choreographer Debbie Allen
directed a video in which Jasmine Guy (``A Different World'')
dances to the song, with narration by Lou Gossett Jr.
   Moore said ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' has been one of her
favorite songs for a number of years, and she's performed it at
meetings of the National Council of Negro Women.
   In the liner notes for the album, Dr. Benjamin Hooks, executive
director of the NAACP, said, ``Every time I hear `Lift Every Voice
and Sing,' I am filled with a deep sense of pride. Ms. Moore's
treatment of this classic ... gives it new zest, vitality and
meaning.
   ``More than any other song, it represents our brave struggle for
freedom and equality, and the faith that has sustained us over all
these weary years. It is part of us, part of our culture and a
treasure to be loved and cherished.''
   Johnson wrote the lyrics to ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' and
his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, an accomplished musician, wrote
the music, for the Stanton School celebration of Abraham Lincoln's
birthday in 1900. A chorus of 500 black children sang the tune.
   Within 20 years, it was known around the world. The song became
an anthem for black Americans during the civil rights movement in
the 1960s.
   A portion of the proceeds of the album are being donated to the
NAACP, the United Negro College Fund and the National Association
for Sickle Cell Disease, Moore said.
   Moore, who was a schoolteacher in Newark, N.J., before going on
to star in Broadway productions of ``Hair,'' ``Timbuktu'' and
``Purlie,'' said she hopes that young people take to the new
version. It was important, she said, that children learn about
Johnson's contributions to American culture.
   ``He is one of our heroes. As far as writers go, everyone knowns
Langston Hughes and James Weldon Johnson,'' Moore said.
   James Weldon Johnson was a lawyer, author, civil rights
activist, educator, foreign consul and newspaper editor. There was
no high school for blacks in Jacksonville, so Johnson was sent to
Atlanta University to complete his education.
   After graduation in 1894, he returned to Jacksonville and became
principal of Stanton School, which he expanded into a high school
for black students.
   Johnson said he was not confronted with racial discrimination
until he was an adolescent.
   ``Neither my father nor mother had taught me directly anything
about race. ... My vague, early impressions constituted ... an
unconscious race-superiority complex. All the most interesting
things ... were being done by colored men,'' he wrote.
   Johnson started the first daily black newspaper in Florida, the
Daily American. He was the first black to pass the Florida Bar exam
and be permitted to practice.
   In 1901, he moved to New York City, where he and his brother
collaborated on 200 songs for musical comedies and light operas,
including``Congo Love Song'' and ``Since You Went Away.''
   As secretary to the NAACP from 1920 to 1930, he conducted the
first statistical analysis of lynching, exposed U.S. Marine
terrorism in Haiti and fought for the passage of the Dyer
Anti-Lynching Bill.
   Johnson served as consul in both Venezuela and Nicaragua, and
was the author of ``God's Trombones,'' ``The Autobiography of an
Ex-Colored Man,'' ``Along This Way'' and numerous other books and
articles.
   In January 1988, a postal stamp was issued in Johnson's memory
in a ceremony at Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn., where he had
been a professor from 1930 until his death in 1938.

<HEAD>NBC's ``Working Girl'' In Need of Situation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Working Girl,'' NBC's new comedy series
premiering tonight, is a harmless knockoff of the big-screen tale
of a secretary with a whole bunch of spunk. But the TV version's
shorthand needs work.
   It takes more than a title to convert the major characters of a
two-hour movie into 22 minutes of mirth. The sitcom struggles of
valiant, working-class Tess McGill, played here by Sandra Bullock,
just don't make you laugh.
   The show's producers bought themselves a name, some characters
and Carly Simon's theme song ``Let the River Run.'' The song, by
the way, was the only Oscar winner among the movie's six
nominations. And somebody else sings it on NBC's venture.
   The movie was a box-office success, largely due to the screwball
premise that a clever, resourceful, ambitious secretary like Tess,
forsaking her friends and upbringing, could wangle a major Wall
Street deal and have Harrison Ford fall in love with her.
   But we knew we wouldn't have to come back to the theater next
week to see how Tess prevailed.
   Situation comedy is different. You want the customers to keep
coming back.
   ``Working Girl: The Series'' is about a Tess who tries to keep
her Staten Island roots and make it in the junior executive program.
   The premiere episode's writers, producers Robin Schiff and Larry
Konner, give Tess a couple of parents, played by B.J. Ward and
David Schramm, who run an unbelievably spacious deli back on Staten
Island.
   They provide a kind of Wonder Bread ethnicity along with the
``meaningful'' conflict. Sample:
   Dad: ``Oh, so you are gonna give up, ah? Just like dat?''
   Tess doesn't fare too well in the dialogue department, either.
One of her lines: ``Dad, you are driving me crazy.''
   Presumably, while Mom and Dad provide confused family
relationships for Tess, her co-workers and superiors at monolithic
Trask Industries provide the laffs. This is theoretical right now:
There aren't many yuks in tonight's show. And everything happens
too quickly.
   And there's no romance! We only briefly meet the neighborhood
hunk, played by Anthony Tyler Quinn. Tess, it seems, has refused to
go out with him since the eighth grade. We can suspect this might
change.
   Nana Visitor has quite a challenge in the Sigourney Weaver role,
Trask's Evil Witch. She's as blonde, sleek and shallow as Tess is
dark, sensitive and sweet. Her survival in the series will depend
on how well she can vacillate between nasty and nice (Come to think
of it, though, the Robinson family never did kill that awful Dr.
Smith on ``Lost in Space'').
   Judy Prescott does a nice job in the Joan Cusack role of the
diehard office pal with the nasal Staten Island accent. Tom
O'Rourke, uttering five or six utterly convincing lines as
self-made jillionaire A.J. Trask, was just fine.
   Still, even the greatest cast cannot overcome indifferent
writing or the disappointed expectations of its likeliest viewers.
Tess may do her best, but there's not much room for ``Working
Girl'' to succeed.
   Let the river dribble.

   Roy Benjamin would like to send hundreds of
thousands of books each month to the Soviet Union and the nations
of Eastern Europe, where he believes there is a huge market for
them.
   Benjamin is a publisher, so you might think this just makes good
sense, just as it makes sense, for example, to hundreds of American
companies with consumer goods or manufactured products to sell.
   But his plan is very different. He would donate his skills and
time. The books would be gifts. He believes those who finance the
idea, those who read the books and the nations involved would be
the better for it.
   In his 73 years, Benjamin has learned that while good ideas are
appreciated, ideas backed by a practical plan of implementation are
worth a hundred times more. And so he has done the preliminary work.
   His proposal, ``International Friendship Books,'' has been
reviewed in publishing circles, shown to the U.S. government
officials and tested directly on officials of the European nations
that would benefit.
   The responses have been uniformly good. Rita Klimova,
Czechoslovakian Amabassador to the United States, told him that the
people of her country ``yearn for books that will tell the American
story.''
   As chairman of the Benjamin Co., based in Elmsford, N.Y., Roy
Benjamin has helped create hundreds of titles and tens of millions
of books, many of them under cooperative arrangements with
corporations.
   He is widely connected in publishing circles and experienced in
bringing various groups together, a requirement of the program he
proposes. These are the basics:
   _Distribution of 100,000 to 500,000 or more copies of a single,
selected title each quarter, eventually monthly, through foreign
schools, colleges, libraries, education groups and other
organizations.
   _Government agencies or book distribution organizations in the
recipient countries would be responsible for seeing that books
reach the selected organizations.
   _A second phase: Sending self-contained libraries or sets of
books to business, professional and political leaders. It was added
when he found professional organizations lacked basic texts _ even
Roberts Rules of Order.
   _American corporations would underwrite costs of the books,
their investment to be justified by the marketing and public
relations dividends their sponsorship would deliver.
   What a great way for American companies to become known in the
new market economies of Europe, he muses, contemplating how they
might benefit from a simple notation on the rear cover _
Compliments of XYZ Company, for example.
   _Foundations, U.S. government agencies, associations and other
groups might participate as joint sponsors.
   _Title selection would be made by a board comprised of U.S.
publishers, editors, educators, librarians and government
officials. Educators and publishers in selected foreign countries
might also make suggestions.
   _Administration and development would be through a
not-for-profit organization, perhaps ``International Friendship
Books Inc.,'' that Benjamin is ready to develop and direct.
   For Benjamin, the idea isn't new. For years he has traveled the
world, and wherever he went the idea was nurtured. Earlier, he had
hoped to develop the plan for China and India, but scarcity of U.S.
products there delayed him.
   When Eastern Europe's socialist nations decided on market
economies, rather than economies dictated centrally by Communist
officials, the idea became more urgent.
   Much depends on the cooperation of U.S. companies, but Benjamin
thinks he'll get it. Why? ``First, as media, books are one of the
few games in town,'' he says. In Eastern Europe, he explains,
access to conventional advertising ``is either non-existent or
severely limited.''
   Next, he says, ``books are highly revered and respected by these
people,'' read and reread, passed on to others, and read again.
``They're never discarded.''
   It's a rare situation in which everyone seems to win. Benjamin,
a well- trophied golfer who spends many hours on the course and who
still must work at his own business, says he isn't afraid of the
added task.
   He says simply, ``I'd like to repay some of the dividends and
fulfillment my work has given me over the years.''

   Margaret Atwood figures a really faithful
adaptation of her book, ``The Handmaid's Tale,'' would run nearly
six hours.
   The author, however, is not complaining about the 109-minute
film now playing in theaters. She considers herself lucky, very
lucky. The plot varies only slightly from her best-selling story
about the Republic of Gilead, a country ruled by right-wing
fundamentalists who overthrew the United States.
   But many writers aren't quite as fortunate when Hollywood takes
their works and mounts them on screen. Something always manages to
get lost in the translation. Hollywood tends to butcher books.
   Many authors understand William Holden's quip in ``Sunset
Boulevard,'' in which he portrayed a luckless scriptwriter: ``The
last one I wrote was about Okies in the desert bowl. You'd never
know because, when it reached the screen, the whole thing played on
a torpedo boat.''
   Film is often stranger than fiction. By the time Bernard
Malamud's ``The Natural'' reached the screen in 1984, slugger Roy
Hobbs had magically reformed, turning down the bribe he accepted in
the book and hitting a game-winning home run that caused Hollywood
sparks to fly.
   The original ending of ``Wuthering Heights'' had Cathy and
Heathcliff dying, just like they did in Emily Bronte's novel. But
when a sneak preview was poorly received, producer Samuel Goldwyn
superimposed ghostly figures of the two lovers walking hand in hand
to heaven. The next preview was rewarded with a long ovation.
   In ``The Wizard of Oz,'' Dorothy's silver slippers become ruby
on the screen for the benefit of Technicolor. The 1933 film of Noel
Coward's play, ``Design for Living,'' was so drastically changed
that screenplay writer Ben Hecht boasted, ``There's only one line
of Coward's left in the picture _ see if you can find it.''
   Even titles are in danger. The 1979 film of Ann Beattie's novel,
``Chilly Scenes of Winter,'' was called ``Head Over Heels.''
According to Beattie, the producers thought the original name
sounded too serious, ``like an Ingmar Bergman film.''
   So Atwood feels grateful that her novel didn't get lost in the
translation, recalling that her reaction to the film was to
``breathe a sigh of relief.''
   She never imagined that a movie of her controversial book would
star such big-name actors as Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway, have a
screenplay by the celebrated English playwright Harold Pinter and
attract a well-respected director such as Volker Schlondorff
(``Death of a Salesman,'' ``The Tin Drum'').
   ``I thought it would take a lot of guts for anybody to do it,''
Atwood said in a recent interview. ``But once given that nerve, I
could certainly see it visually and see it dramatically.''
   Bobbie Ann Mason is also among the grateful, although the film
of her popular novel, ``In Country,'' received mixed reviews. The
author was pleased that it stuck faithfully to her story of Sam
Hughes, a Kentucky teen-ager trying to learn more about her late
father.
   Mason was also glad that the movie didn't ``stereotype the
country folks.''
   ``I think the story and the characters came across very well,''
said Mason, who had high praise for stars Emily Lloyd and Bruce
Willis, and screenwriter Frank Pierson.
   ``I thought the actors did add something extra. Emily Lloyd
really brought across Sam's energy and I thought Bruce brought
(Sam's uncle) Emmett into a focus that I hadn't perceived.''
   But include Fay Weldon among the less grateful. The author would
rather not discuss ``She-Devil,'' which takes the sharp curves of
her darkly funny ``The Life and Loves of a She-Devil,'' and turns
them into flat, ineffective comedy.
   ``She-Devil'' retains the basic plot of the ugly housewife Ruth
wrecking the life of beautiful romance novelist Mary Fisher who's
run off with Ruth's husband, Bob. But that's about all the two
works have in common.
   In the book Ruth is a giant of a woman. Not in the movie; she's
played by the short, fat, compact Roseanne Barr. In the book, Ruth
spends years and millions of dollars having painful and
revolutionary surgery to make her face look like Mary's and to chop
bone from her thighs to make herself shorter. None of this happens
in the movie.
   In the book, Ruth commits several crimes and has several sexual
encounters after her husband runs off with Mary Fisher, including a
lesbian relationship. Not in the movie.
   The film was poorly received, especially compared to the
acclaimed British Broadcasting Co. miniseries run on PBS.
   ``I thought Meryl Streep was wonderful,'' was all Weldon would
say at first about ``She-Devil,'' which featured Streep as Mary
Fisher. But the author, seeking a way to ``phrase this tactfully,''
then discussed the problems of handing over creative control.
   ``If you sign an American contract, you go to the American
Embassy and you undertake to sell your rights to the story,''
Weldon said in a telephone interview from her home outside London.
``You also have to declare that you're in your right mind.
   ``I thought I would be able to look at it dispassionately, but I
found that I wasn't.''
   For Atwood, the real hero is producer Daniel Wilson, who has won
18 Emmys for his television specials, including five for the ABC
Afterschool Special, ``The Late Great Me: Story of a Teen-age
Alcoholic.''
   The author said she chose Wilson because he was passionate about
the book and that he would make sure the film had the proper feel.
   But Atwood had one major complaint.
   ``They did an outrageous poster in Germany which makes it look a
`men-in-a-raincoat' film, kind of soft porn. There's going to be a
lot of disappointed men in raincoats. It was really quite
astonishing. That's what I was trying to avoid,'' she said.
   Still, Atwood is eager to try it again. She recently finished
the script for her most recent novel, ``Cat's Eye,'' and says the
earlier works ``Bodily Harm'' and ``Life Before Man'' have been
optioned.
   Mason raved about the excitement of having ``In Country'' made
into a movie and has written a screenplay for the novel ``Spence
&plus;Lila.'' Weldon said that a film of her novel, ``Puffball,'' is
being considered and admitted that even the disappointment of
``She-Devil'' has not quite wiped the stars from her eyes.
   ``Yes, of course I would do it again,'' she insisted. ``Film's
much more fun. I think the whole process is amazing, and there is a
feeling on the set of major films that's like nowhere else.''

<HEAD>What About Checkpoint Charlie? Make It a Tourist Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What do you do with an obsolete border
guardhouse, especially if it's right downtown? ``Turn it into a
tourist office,'' says a veteran U.S. Army sergeant at the
Checkpoint Charlie crossing.
   Communism has crumbled in East Germany, the Berlin Wall is
derelict and 30,000 people pass through Checkpoint Charlie every
day, in both directions.
   The four-power agreements dividing Berlin into U.S., British and
French sectors in the West and a Soviet sector in the East remains
in effect, but Berlin has been caught up in the wave of change in
Eastern Europe.
   For soldiers of the Western Allies, the changes include
canceling this year's military parade and being able to visit East
Berlin in civilian clothes.
   East Germany has even made three new border crossings for
Western military personnel.
   To Air Force Capt. Janet Bent of Grand Terrace, Calif., and Army
Staff Sgt. Nathaniel Brown of St. Louis, Mo., the differences are
important.
   Brown has worked at Checkpoint Charlie since May 1987. He has
grim memories of the days before the wall fell in the peaceful
revolution that ousted East Germany's Communist government last
fall.
   ``I've seen three people make escape attempts at this
crossing,'' and East German guards ``grabbed them, kicked and beat
them, really got down and dirty with them,'' he said.
   ``Now those same guards are out there smiling and waving people
through,'' the 39-year-old sergeant said. ``I never believed it
would happen in my lifetime.''
   Before the wall opened, armed U.S. patrols regularly drove along
the barrier to monitor East German guards and possible Soviet troop
movements.
   ``There are no more patrols,'' Brown said in an interview.
``We're armed as military police, but about all we do is give out
tourist information and advise people on visiting East Berlin.''
   ``I'm thinking of putting in a work order to have a sign made
up, `Checkpoint Charlie Tourist Information Office','' he said,
laughing as an American soldier approached to ask advice about the
East.
   Soldiers formerly had to sign a log at the checkpoint before
crossing into East Berlin. Brown said that changed early in April
with the decision that all Western troops based in Berlin could
visit the East out of uniform.
   ``Before, West Berlin troops had to be back here by midnight,''
he said. ``Now they can stay for a weekend in East Berlin if they
want.''
   Allied soldiers based in West Germany still must wear uniforms
when visiting East Berlin.
   Checkpoint Charlie is manned jointly by U.S., British and French
troops. The United States has about 6,000 soldiers in West Berlin,
the British 4,000 and the French about 2,500.
   About 350,000 Soviet troops are based in East Germany. City
officials say most of them are at sites around Berlin.
   Capt. Bent, based in Berlin since July, said she often must
cross the border to escort U.S. Air Force officials visiting East
Berlin.
   She said being allowed to wear civilian clothes was important
for her.
   ``From my standpoint as a female in uniform, which the Soviets
and East Germans don't see very often, I got a lot of stares,'' she
said. ``With civilian clothes, it's more comfortable.''
   She said she recently crossed into East Berlin in uniform, ``and
an East German guard smiled and saluted me.''
   ``Now we can go across by car, on foot, on a bicycle or train,
and can use public transport in East Berlin,'' she said. ``Before,
we couldn't.''
   Klaus Haetzel, a spokesman for Mayor Walter Momper of West
Berlin, said the Allies agreed to cancel the annual military parade
``because it no longer fits in the current situation, with the wall
open and military reduction talks.''
   The first parade was held June 17, 1964, the anniversary of a
workers' uprising in East Germany in 1953, to show Western resolve
to defend Berlin. The wall was built in August 1961.

<HEAD>Wall Street Taking the Cure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The way many analysts see it, the sluggish
behavior of the stock market in the first few months of 1990
reflects more than just uncertainty about the outlook for interest
rates or corporate profits.
   Stock prices have been left to drift in light trading activity,
they theorize, as the very idea of acquisitive risk-taking has
undergone a temporary fall from favor.
   The nation is preoccupied right now with cleaning up a series of
financial messes _ among them the savings and loan debacle, Wall
Street's junk-bond binge of the 1980s and a welter of bad loans in
the banking business.
   At the same time, the free-spending consumers of the past decade
show signs of adopting a new ethic, building up their depleted
savings reserves instead of taking on bold new commitments.
   All this tends to put a damper on both the economy and the
markets, which depend on the aggressive pursuit of wealth for much
of their energy.
   Some say it raises the threat of a consumer-induced recession.
Others worry about the possibility of a ``credit crunch,'' in which
constraints on lending create a scarcity of money for investment in
business, housing and big-ticket consumer purchases.
   But worrisome as these budding trends may be for the immediate
future, observers also argue they could be a significant plus for
the economy and Wall Street over the long term.
   If all goes right, they say, what is going on now could clear
away past excesses and help build a stable base from which future
opportunities and growth could arise.
   The latest example of investors' concerns is a sweeping inquiry
by government regulators into the lending practices of banks, which
has evoked visions of a long dry spell for borrowers.
   ``There is a lot to keep investors jumpy, if not downright
scared,'' says Michael Sherman, investment strategist at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Are bank regulators going to create such havoc in the
financial markets as to create a credit crunch and an economic
downturn? Is the S&amp;L contraction an open-ended sewer?''
   Such questions aren't easy to answer right now, Sherman says,
but he argues that the picture nevertheless has its positive side.
   ``If you think the situation is fraught with peril today, you
should be glad the government didn't wait for tomorrow to staunch
open wounds in the financial fabric. At least we're not living in a
fool's paradise.
   ``If we survive the cure, we will have a chance of living both
better and longer, in a financial sense.''
   Furthermore, Sherman contends, any squeeze on economic activity
could well have a favorable impact by bringing interest rates down.
   ``That decline would come quickly,'' he adds, ``because the
areas of the economy most affected are also those that are most
credit-sensitive, namely construction and real estate.''
   Most observers agree that, in intent at least, the drive to
clean up the financial environment is sensible and directed at the
right targets.
   The question, they say, is how decision-makers and the markets
are able to negotiate the distance between where things stand today
and the goal.
   As Neal Soss, economist at First Boston Corp., defined the
problem: ``BEING prudent, like being sober or having a high saving
rate, is a good thing. But GETTING prudent, like getting sober or
raising the saving rate, involves a certain transitional
discomfort.''

<HEAD>Schools Receive Millions in Corporate Partnerships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businesses are becoming the Fairy
Godmothers of the nation's schools, providing money, manpower and
expertise to fulfill dreams of first-class programs and equipment.
   Even Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus is getting in on
the act.
   ``Addressing the need for reform in education is everybody's
business,'' says Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer at
RJR Nabisco, agreed, noting ``the need for business to be an active
partner in improving our children's learning.''
   The Nabisco Foundation late last month selected 15 schools to
share $8.5 million in grants. The money is part of a five-year, $30
million program that funds innovative, community-based experiments
whose successes can be replicated.
   The Education Department reports that business and corporate
partnerships with schools tripled from 46,338 in 1983 to about
141,000 in 1988. Such partnerships provide support to 40 percent of
all public schools, compared with 17 percent five years ago.
   ``The business community through partnerships and tutoring has
been signaling for three to four years that it's interested in
working with the education community,'' said Keith Geiger,
president of the National Education Association.
   Businesses are worried about the bottom line and an impending
labor shortage. Of the 3.8 million 18-year-old Americans in 1988,
fully 700,000 had dropped out of school and another 700,000 could
not read their high school diplomas.
   ``It's good business to be involved in education,'' said Bernard
Gifford of Apple Computer Inc.
   The Committee for Economic Development, an independent research
organization, estimates that each year's class of dropouts costs
the United States more than $240 billion in lost earnings and tax
income over their lifetimes.
   The National Alliance of Business says employers already are
spending $210 billion a year on job training and retraining. By
1995, it says, the figure could reach $300 billion a year.
   By that time, the alliance says, some 14 million Americans will
be unprepared for the jobs available.
   ``Business has been involved for many years in helping schools
and school systems,'' said alliance President William Kolberg.
``But much of this effort has been focused on tinkering at the
margin.''
   Now, he says, business is supporting ``systemic changes'' in
educational programs.
   The quality and type of partnerships vary widely, from
full-fledged programs aimed at producing long-term improvement for
students, to public relations ploys designed mainly to promote a
company's name.
   The Council on Economic Priorities said the most prevalent forms
of business involvement in education are adopt-a-school
arrangements, including financial grants, equipment gifts, awards
ceremonies or plant visits, and tutoring.
   The Tandy Corp. last month gave a total of $350,000 in cash
stipends and scholarships to 100 students and 100 teachers
recognized for outstanding accomplishments in mathematics, science
or computer science.
   Four years ago, Ringling Bros. decided to help tackle illiteracy
_ an estimated 23 million American adults cannot read _ and kicked
off a nationwide ``Ringling Readers'' program. It uses a 25-minute
presentation performed by circus clowns to encourage youngsters to
read.
   When the circus came to the nation's capital recently,
``Patches'' Jim Wade donned a clown face, a colorful top hat over
bushy hair, and bright red-striped clown pants to visit 20 area
elementary schools. His message: ``Reading Lets You Imagine.''
   Apple computers are being placed in thousands of kindergarten
through 12th grade classrooms as part of an ``Apples For The
Students'' program in more than 1,000 communities in 38 states.
Under the program, schools collect receipts from 34 supermarket
chains, then turn them back to the supermarket in exchange for a
computer.
   International Business Machines Corp.'s support for education is
similarly broad. Its activities involve more than 22,000 employees
in more than 750 local community partnerships.
   Kenneth Lay, director of IBM's education programs, said that in
1989 the company spent more than $28 million in support of
elementary and secondary education.
   North Carolina National Bank last year began providing $2
million a year to support leadership academies for superintendents
and other administrators in 15 southern states. Participants learn
how to apply management theory to a school setting.
   The Coca-Cola Foundation has budgeted $50 million to support
national education initiatives. Pepsico early last year announced a
multimillion-dollar pilot dropout prevention program, while General
Electric budgeted $20 million for education.
   US West in February announced it will invest $10 million over
the next three years in early-childhood programs in 14 Western
states.
   Campbell Soup Co., meanwhile, encourages teachers and students
at more than 25,000 schools to collect labels and then redeem them
for equipment offered in a catalog supplied by the company.

<HEAD>Boatlift Brought Chaos, Hit ``Nasty Chords''</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When reporter Maria Montoya first visited Key West,
it was just after midnight, May 1, 1980, and the boatlift of
refugees from Mariel, Cuba, was in full swing.
   But Ms. Montoya was on the other side of the cameras.
   A U.S. Coast Guard ship had rescued her, her husband, Eduardo,
and 10 other people packed inside a disabled 18-foot boat adrift in
the Gulf Stream after completing most of the 90-mile journey from
Cuba.
   The boatlift was only 10 days old, and Ms. Montoya and her
husband got a warm reception. They were cheered as they stepped
onto U.S. territory, and welcomed by U.S. soldiers and volunteer
workers who gave them food and clothing.
   One sight seemed strange, though.
   ``I saw 300 men, their heads almost shaved, sitting on the
dock,'' she said. ``I asked, `Why are those men sitting apart?'
Someone told me, ``Those are the criminals and the mental patients
Castro is sending us.'''
   The boatlift then was being hailed as ``the Freedom Flotilla,''
an embarrassment to Fidel Castro's regime and a chance, as
President Jimmy Carter said, to welcome ``with open arms'' those
fleeing oppression.
   But before it ended five months later, when Castro closed the
Port of Mariel, it had become a disaster, costing hundreds of
millions of dollars, stirring murderous crime waves, and escalating
prejudices.
   ``The whole Mariel boatlift struck very deep, nasty chords in
the American public,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the
immigration policy group, The National Forum.
   ``Marielito'' became a derisive label meaning misfits, crazies,
hard-core criminals.
   ``But you know what? Most of them did just fine,'' Sharry said.
   Ms. Montoya, now 33, who risked a relatively comfortable life as
a Cuban radio and television actress, is among dozens successful in
the media and the arts. Others have made their marks in fields such
as business, education and sports, and several boatlift children
became honor students and valedictorians. But the stigma remains.
   Even after the initial crime waves blamed on Mariel refugees
subsided, their image was furthered by such cases as the 1984
slaying of a Miami Beach police officer; 1987 riots and
hostage-taking by refugees in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., federal
prisons; and the fire last month that claimed 87 lives at the Happy
Land social club in the Bronx, in which a Mariel refugee is
charged. Unlike many of the refugees, Ms. Montoya, who recently
returned to Key West to film a report for Spanish-language WLTV
television on the boatlift's anniversary, never hesitates to tell
when and how she arrived in this country.
   ``Bad people came, and a lot of good people came,'' she said.
``I held back a lot, when people were talking about how bad the
Mariel people were. People would say to me, `Oh, you don't look
like a Mariel person.' That bothered me. There was a stereotype,
and I am an individual.''
   Nearly a month before her arrival, Ms. Montoya and her husband
had dashed into the Peruvian embassy in Havana, joining a confused,
desperate throng that finally totaled 10,800 people.
   ``I think Castro never expected that many people wanted to
leave. When he saw that, he wanted to spoil their image,'' Ms.
Montoya said.
   U.S. Sen. Bob Graham was then in his second year as Florida's
governor. He recalls attending a luncheon in Washington in April
1980 and being told by hastily scattering State Department
officials of the embassy situation.
   Within weeks, the distant-seeming foreign policy question became
his state's crisis when Castro abruptly announced that Mariel was
open.
   A rag-tag armada of boats chartered by Cuban-Americans anxious
to pick up relatives set sail, and returned with some surprising
cargo. Along with parents, aunts and uncles, friends and former
political prisoners, the boats brought passengers picked by the
Cuban government.
   Castro and the state-controlled media crowed that the United
States was getting ``the bums and scum.''
   ``We don't want them,'' Castro told a cheering Havana crowd.
``We don't need them.''
   By throwing in Cuban miscreants, Castro portrayed the boatlift
as a sweeping out of his society.
   Unleashed on American society from spartan Cuban gulags, the
boatlift's criminal element spurred street crime explosions in
Miami's Little Havana and among the elderly of Miami Beach, then
spread into other U.S. cities.
   Their crimes were the worst of many problems.
   ``It had a human impact by adding 125,000 people to the
population,'' reflected Graham. ``It contributed to a tense
community situation by surfacing tensions. I think it contributed
to the (May 1980 Liberty City race) riots.
   ``Castro was able to unload criminals and undesirable elements
... and there was an immediate and continuing strain on health and
social institutions,'' he said.
   With the Cuban economy stagnant and the government increasingly
isolated by the crumbling of the Socialist bloc, U.S. officials say
they have readied contingency plans to prevent a new Mariel.
   ``Castro has used opening up his borders as a tactic to relieve
pressure,'' Graham said. ``We're in a dilemma because our national
tradition is that we provide sanctuary, but we ought to discourage
(a new boatlift) and make sure it's an orderly movement.''
   About one-fifth of the Mariel refugees had served jail time in
Cuba, but for the great majority, it was for petty offenses or
political crimes.
   Today, most authorities say fewer than 10 percent of the
refugees were criminals. Some 2,600 still are in federal custody,
173 were returned to Cuba under a suspended immigration agreement,
and an estimated 4,000 are in various state and local prisons.
   ``I can tell you now that the impact was positive,'' said Miami
City Manager Cesar Odio. ``Only a small percentage created
problems. Most have been good citizens. But the immediate impact
was negative _ for all Cubans.''
   A Gallup Poll at the time indicated that Cubans, usually
considered an immigration success story, had become one of the
nation's most unpopular alien groups.
   That image made resettling the immigrants difficult. Many were
placed in refugee camps at U.S. military bases in the Florida
Panhandle, Arkansas, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Frustrated
refugees rioted in Arkansas, and there were disturbances in the
other camps.
   Carter declared the boatlift illegal a month after it began.
Boat captains were fined and had their vessels confiscated.
   But it was too late. About 70,000 Cubans already had arrived,
and more were on their way.
   The only other time Castro had opened a port, Camarioca in 1965,
the total number of refugees was fewer than 6,000.
   ``In the beginning, we completely missed the boat,'' said
Gunther O. Wagner, who worked for the State Department's
Cuban-Haitian Task Force. ``How did we know? Would we get 300,
3,000, 10,000? We got 125,000.''
   The criminal image and the large number of single men, thousands
of them homosexuals, made finding sponsors difficult.
   ``A lot of groups just gave up,'' said Sharry. ``The church
groups we were used to working with were nice, suburban churches.
And now here's Fileno with a tattoo on his eyelid ready to go to
the church picnic?''

   The last resettlement camp, Fort Chaffee, Ark., was open until
Feb. 16, 1982, nearly two years after the boatlift began.
   ``The refugees kept asking: `When are you going to get me out of
here? I've been lied to and lied to,''' Sharry recalled. ``We
failed a lot of them.''
   Sharry and others involved in the Mariel resettlement can laugh
now about some of their headaches.
   Sharry recalls one of the first refugees he found a sponsor for
``split for the coast'' with the sponsor's very willing ``nice
church lady'' wife. Wagner says one ``very industrious young man''
stole a bus and was found in Seattle driving around town and
collecting fares for his own gypsy bus service.
   And they have warm memories of the refugees who overcame
frustration and finally succeeded.
   ``I am proud to have helped so many people find freedom,''
Wagner said.

<HEAD>Thousand of Mariel Refugees Jailed in Legal Limbo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since five handcuffed Cubans from the 1980 Mariel
boatlift boarded a government jet in December 1988 for the homeland
they fled, 168 more have followed.
   Some, numbed by their years in jail, went voluntarily, feeling
that as bad as Cuba may be, it beat the prospect of an indefinite
stretch in a maximum-security prison in the United States.
   But thousands more who have completed their sentences remain
behind bars with no idea when, or even if, they will get out. Many
eventually are freed, but those identified as the tougher cases are
not.
   By law, the United States can hold them as long as it wants,
even for life, although no charges remain against them.
   ``Of those who have gone back to Cuba, we know of a few who have
been released, a few who are still in jail,'' said Decatur, Ga.,
attorney Gary LeShaw, who represents many detainees.
   ``Of those who went back, I'd say about 30 of them went
voluntarily, not because they wanted to go back to Cuba but because
they thought they had a better chance for release there,'' he said.
   About once a month, a few more judged deportable are taken from
the federal prison at Talladega, Ala., to Birmingham for the
90-minute flight back to Cuba.
   The great majority of the 125,000 ``Marielitos,'' as they are
known, are law-abiding and have adjusted to American life in the
decade since their arrival.
   An estimated 80,000 have become American citizens, and the
others are on immigration parole and have been told they won't be
bothered if they stay out of trouble.
   Thus, while Marielitos have been in this country for a decade,
technically, they aren't really here and never have been. The
courts have ruled they have no constitutional guarantees.
   People who enter the United States illegally must be released
after six months if their native countries will not take them back.
But Mariel Cubans, named for the port from which they left in an
exodus authorized by Cuban President Fidel Castro, don't fit that
category.
   They are classed as ``excludable aliens.''
   ``I felt and I still feel that any person the attorney general
holds beyond a reasonable time is entitled to a hearing to see if
that reason is a sufficient reason,'' said U.S. District Judge
Marvin Shoob of Atlanta, who ruled in 1983 that the Mariel Cubans
were entitled to limited due process.
   He was reversed by a federal appeals court, and the U.S. Supreme
Court declined to hear the case. Shoob said it is unlikely the case
will get into the appeals court system again and that congressional
legislative action is the only apparent avenue for change.
   ``It was not a happy episode in U.S. jurisprudence,'' Shoob said.
   But, he said, ``The vast majority of those who deserve to get
out have gotten out.''
   Initially, Cuba agreed to take back the 2,726 Cubans jailed as
of Dec. 14, 1984. It accepted 201 before Castro ended the agreement
in 1985 in retaliation for the American broadcast of Radio Marti
beamed at Cuba.
   Of the 201, 156 were reported free in Cuba at one point after
spending time in medical quarantine.
   In late 1987, Cuba agreed to accept the rest at a rate of up to
100 a month, sparking riots at federal prisons in Atlanta and
Oakdale, La., where about 3,800 Cubans who had finished their
sentences were detained by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   Of the 3,800, LeShaw said, about two-thirds have been freed
after reviews by special Justice Department panels. The reviews
were one of the concessions made to the Cubans in custody during
the riots for surrendering control of the prisons.
   But Shoob said the review concession was less than it seemed.
   ``Under the agreements, there are no requirements for the
government to supply attorneys or for the cases to be heard before
disinterested parties,'' Shoob said.
   Duke Austin, an INS spokesman in Washington D.C., said reviews
are all the law provides for.
   ``It is not a judicial process. It is an administrative record
review only,'' he said. `` ... The majority are being paroled out.
The INS has paroled every (detained) Cuban at one time or another
but about 60. They all had a chance.''
   The 60 were identified on arrival as hardened criminals or
severe mental cases, and have been held since 1980. The rest are
jailed for things that occurred after they got here. About 2,600
are in INS custody now, and the agency has detainers on another
4,000 who are serving sentences, Austin said.
   Lawyers who represent the Cubans complain of arrogance and
ignorance on the part of some review panel members.
   ``I have never seen such a farce in my life,'' reads a memo from
Lafayette, La., attorney Judith Gardner, who represented a woman
jailed for theft.
   ``I will never forget the panel members. They were cynical and
accusatory,'' Ms. Gardner said. ``They were disrespectful and
seemed to revel in playing God over the lives of these people.''
   She said they accused her client of crimes she had never been
charged with and told her she never would be released to an area
near where her mother lives.
   The treatment of those returned to Cuba remains uncertain.
   Roberto Martinez, sent back to Cuba in March 1989, wrote to an
American friend from jail there, ``We received a good attention
from them but it only was the first days. But we would not make any
communications with our family during 54 days and we just didn't
know why.''
   Martinez' letter said he was moved to another prison and allowed
to see a judge.
   ``He said that we are peligrosos (dangerous ones) and also he
said that we are not ready to make our lives within the community.
In other words we have received two and the half year sentence with
the charge of peligrosidad (dangerousness),'' he wrote.
   The letter said he hoped to be free by the end of 1989.
   Whether he was is undetermined.

<TEXT>
   In the early 1970s, Robert Mapplethorpe took his
first photographs with a Polaroid camera. It was the perfect tool
for radical art.
   What was radical about his work was not so much the subject
matter but the process and materials he applied to a stagnant form,
adding fabric, texture, tone.
   Form and technique, however, are not what spring to mind these
days when considering the late artist. Today, it is the rough
images he immortalized _ oral sex, bondage, homosexual fondling _
that make him an important force in 20th-century art.
   Perhaps Mapplethorpe never fully realized his destiny as an
artist. He died in March 1989 at the age of 42 of complications
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   In death, he is embroiled in controversy and has become a symbol
for artistic freedom.
   A Mapplethorpe exhibit last June at the Corcoran Gallery of Art
in Washington was canceled after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared
some of the artist's photographs to be obscene. Helms' objections
resulted in a move by Congress to limit federal funds to the arts.
   Mapplethorpe's works have been shown at the Whitney Museum of
Art in New York, and in Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Berkeley,
Calif., and Hartford, Conn. But a grand jury this month indicted
the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, on obscenity
charges for showing his works. The center and its director will be
arraigned Monday.
   ``I wasn't starting out to make a statement, that isn't the way
I work,'' Mapplethorpe once said. ``The statement grows out of what
I do.''
   In his 1976-77 work ``Bill,'' Mapplethorpe placed a mirror
between two panels of a man masturbating. The idea is to have the
viewer see him or herself flanked by two erect penises.
   He used the same technique in 1979's ``Easter Lilies With
Mirror.'' Here, four panels form a cross around a center mirror.
The lilies are shown in dramatic shadows, a dusting of light
illuminating their inner and almost religious beauty.
   It is a way of engaging the viewer beyond mere voyeurism; the
viewer becomes a part of the work.
   In the triptych ``Brice Marden'' (1976), Mapplethorpe shows the
artist full-figure sitting with his own work in the background, a
close-up in the center panel, and the last panel blank. It is a
wonderful study in depth perception.
   But the intense shadow composition of another triptych, ``Jim
and Tom, Sausalito'' (1977-78), is obliterated by the action in the
picture, in which one man urinates on another. Around the same
time, Mapplethorpe did a self-portrait, posed partly naked in
leather with the handle of a bullwhip in his rectum.
   They are among his most disturbing photographs, part of a period
in which he unraveled a violent homosexual mystique for an
unsuspecting audience. They are terrifying, sadomasochistic
tableaux _ chained men, leather-bound men, men prepared for pain in
an aristocratic setting.
   But despite the frightening roughness of these sexual and
psychological images, Mapplethorpe succeeded in crafting a rich
tonal range.
   ``He was involved in an incredibly wide variety of life, the
other side of which is death,'' said the artist Lowell Nesbitt, who
first met and befriended Mapplethorpe in 1971-72.
   ``It's very clear that much of his photographs were mirrors of
his personal life. I think that Mapplethorpe really wanted to be
censored. He was pushing for it. He was pushing the artistic
barriers, the way many artists have in the past, to see how far he
could push before he could met a boundary.''
   Back in the early '70s, a time of rainbow drugs and easy sex, of
troubled politics and an unpopular war, Mapplethorpe was into
jewelry.
   ``He was an artist, but he wasn't exactly painting,'' said
Nesbitt. He would refashion jewelry by adding materials to
customize a piece for the owner.
   Mapplethorpe was one of six children born to Joan and Harry
Mapplethorpe. He fled his Catholic childhood in Floral Park,
Queens, for the bohemian earthiness of Brooklyn in the 1960s.
There, he received his art education at Pratt Institute.
   It also was there that he encountered and forged a lasting
friendship with radical poet and musician Patti Smith. Together,
they shared in each other's work and supported each other's dreams.
They were avant-garde _ hippies while others were still beatniks,
punk before the first British rude boy spat out the word, outlaws
while others were simply radical.
   He spent his artistic lifetime photographing Smith. Her
portraits range from early Polaroids to the portrait he used on her
1988 LP, ``Dream of Life.''
   The 1978 triptych, ``Patti Smith (Still Moving)'' shows Smith in
muted tones intertwined with a flimsy curtain, her clothes falling
away, her features slightly blurred. A portrait in 1976 shows a
vulnerable, naked Smith, curled up on her haunches, clinging to
pipes in a barren studio.
   Mapplethorpe said there was little difference in photographing
men or women: ``It's like sculpture finally, working with a
three-dimensional form. Most of the people I photograph are not
trained models or actors, but they all have strong personalities.''
   He did portraits of actor Richard Gere, artists Louise Nevelson
and Alice Neel, lawyer Roy Cohn, body builder Lisa Lyon and
transvestite Candy Darling. And they were as varied as his
classically poetic studies of flowers, fruit and vegetables.
   ``His great mentor was Sam Wagstaff, the museum curator,''
Nesbitt said. ``He introduced Mapplethorpe to what were the most
advanced forms of art going on in the United States at that time.
He probably helped develop Mapplethorpe's very personal eye and
incredible ability to use light, which was somewhat prophetic.
   ``A lot of photographers are equally capable technically, but it
takes an artist-photographer to distinguish himself, and what does
this is a very personal eye.''
   Mapplethorpe's eye consumed more than merely the flat surface of
a photo. He infused light and shadow, certainly, but he also
applied textures and tones, using fabric and paint such as platinum
on linen or mesh wire overlays. His early work utilized collage for
drama and movement.
   Photographs became not an end in themselves, but the raw
material for a work's foundation. In 1971, he painted over a
yellowed, torn childhood photo of artist Andy Warhol, leaving one
smiling eye, his mouth and shoulder untouched.
   In his last years, his work was austere. Beauty was found in
simplicity. A 1988 picture titled ``Nipple'' could be a parched
desert, the moon's surface or a dried river bed. But it is a
closeup of the human form.
   ``Calla Lily'' (1988) is a stark portrait of the sculpted
flower. And his study of a man named Thomas in 1986 showed
Mapplethorpe in classic form: A naked man strains against a circle,
a geometric work reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci.
   ``I'm sure he felt he had made an amazing achievement
artistically,'' Nesbitt said. ``He had the self-satisfaction of
considering himself a major influence.''

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An old man wagged his finger at
Prince Sultan, second in line to the throne, and complained that
his soldier son was assigned to a base far from his home in Riyadh.
   ``But your son has obligations as a soldier,'' said the prince,
who also is the Saudi defense minister.
   ``He has obligations to his family,'' the man retorted. Sultan
consulted his advisors and announced that the young man would be
reassigned in Riyadh, the kingdom's capital.
   The exchange took place during a ``majlis,'' or consultation,
Sultan regularly holds with the people. A foreign reporter was
permitted to attend.
   Most days, Sultan and the scores of other princes in Saudi
Arabia's extended royal family open the doors of their palaces to
the people. They listen to complaints on all manner of issues and
settle disputes.
   It's the nearest thing the Saudis have to democracy and there is
little demand for more from the estimated 8 million citizens of
this desert kingdom, which sits on one-quarter of the world's oil
reserves. About 3 million foreign workers also live in Saudi Arabia.
   Representative democracy is overwhelming communism in Eastern
Europe and making inroads in the Third World, including neighboring
Arab countries.
   In Saudi Arabia, tribal tradition and huge oil profits let the
royal bosses of the world's richest family-operated business
provide opportunity, public services and security that make
democracy a non-issue.
   The monarchy rules through wide consensus with all segments of
society. Laws are based on the Koran, the holy book of Islam
considered to be God-given to the Prophet Mohammed, who founded the
religion in the 7th century.
   Prince Majed, brother of King Fahd and governor of the Red Sea
province that includes the holy city of Mecca, told reporters
recently that communism and other temporal ideologies ``are false
and contrary to human nature.''
   The majlis system gives an estimated 250,000 Saudis access to
princes and senior officials every year on behalf of their families.
   In a social system fed by billions of dollars from oil revenue,
citizens pay no taxes.
   Education is free through university, and each college student
gets $800 a month in pocket money. Health services, extensive and
of high quality, are free.
   A jet air ambulance makes at least 200 flights a month to ferry
patients from remote areas to Riyadh for surgery at the lavish King
Faisal Specialty Hospital.
   To build a home, each Saudi family gets a free plot of 625
square meters _ about 750 square yards _ and a 30-year loan of
$80,000, free of interest.
   People who build clinics, factories, workshops or hotels get
interest-free loans equivalent to 70 percent of the construction
costs.
   Generous pensions are paid on retirement.
   ``So who needs democracy?'' a Western diplomat asked.
   In tense times, the Saudi rulers customarily say they may
establish a Majlis al-Shura, or consultative assembly, a
quasi-parliament with most or all of the members chosen by the king.
   Such a council, approved by Islamic tradition, was mentioned in
1975, when a deranged nephew murdered King Faisal and his
successors were taking control.
   The nephew was publicly beheaded, a punishment decreed in the
Koran and imposed routinely for murder, sex crimes or drug
smuggling. Public executions take place in Riyadh's main square on
many Fridays.
   More beheadings and new mention of a Majlis were decreed in 1979
after a group of fundamentalist fanatics seized the Great Mosque of
Mecca. That event sent shock waves through the royal family, which
pins much of its legitimacy to its piety.
   The fundamentalists demanded an end to what they considered
excessive Western influence in Saudi Arabia's rapid modernization
during the oil boom years.
   In 1987, after Iranian-backed sabotage in the oil provinces and
during the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca, Fahd was said to be
studying the Majlis plan again.
   Still there is no council, appointed or elected. A handsome
structure to house it stands empty in the grounds of Fahd's
al-Yamamah palace in Riyadh.
   ``I believe it will come, but it's a matter of priorities,''
said a senior Saudi official. Like other sources, he did not want
his name used.
   ``There's no groundswell of opinion for the Majlis,'' an
influential newspaper editor said. ``The people are satisfied with
the tranquility, stability, security, prosperity, the freedom to
travel.''
   Unrestricted travel to the West is a safety valve for middle
class Saudis.
   They mingle with Westerners and indulge, often ostentatiously,
in night life and the West's freewheeling culture. At home, they
live under strict Islamic rules that prohibit alcohol, unveiled
women in public, women drivers or shopping or recreation during the
five daily times of prayer.
   Tourism to Saudi Arabia is all but non-existent. Apart from
Moslem pilgrims, most visitors are businessmen or expatriate
workers.
   Most Westerners live in walled company compounds where the women
can play tennis or swim in bikinis. Residents receive unpublicized
shipments of liquor.
   The royal family has more than 3,000 princes, 500 in the direct
line of succession. This has ensured stability through family unity
and tight control of extensive security forces.
   Free enterprise and generous social programs have been crucial
in transforming a semi-nomadic society, with little upheaval, into
a modern one with a strong sense of Islamic identity.
   Saudi officials say King Abdulaziz ibn Saud, who conquered most
of the Arabian peninsula and founded modern Saudi Arabia in 1927
with British backing, established the consensus rule on which the
country's government is based.
   Abdulaziz is quoted as telling his sons the ``thread'' of
consensus ties to the people is stronger than the ``iron bands'' of
autocracy.
   A Saudi journalist with access to one of the top princes said
that, instead of creating a consultative council, the rulers
decided a few years ago to expand the ``open majlis'' system with
Fahd, princes and top officials opening their palaces for regular
meetings with citizens.
   The atmosphere of the open majlis is informal. The king is not
addressed as ``your majesty'' but as ``Fahd,'' ``Father of Faisal''
or ``Taweel al Umur,'' Arabic for ``long life.''
   Religious leaders are brought in on important decisions to avoid
dissension, and other important constituencies are consulted
regularly.
   An expert in Saudi affairs said the 1990-95 economic plan was
circulated for two years in advance among businessmen, economists
and others, and many alterations were made as a result.
   ``This gave a large number of key people the feeling and reality
of participation,'' he said.
   Saudis are concerned about tense relations with Iran, a major
regional power, and about a new Arab-Israel conflict and the
vulnerability of their oil facilities to bombing or missile attacks.
   They have forged close security ties with the United States and
are a huge market for Western arms sales.
   To keep Palestinian guerrillas from causing trouble in the
kingdom as they have in other Arab nations, the Saudis make
generous contributions to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The only significant internal opposition to royal rule is the
Shiite Moslem minority in the oil-producing eastern provinces along
the Persian Gulf.
   More than 90 percent of Saudis belong to the mainstream Sunni
branch of Islam, but some ``usulis'' or fundamentalists, among the
several hundred thousand Shiites are influenced by predominantly
Shiite Iran. They are blamed for the sabotage of oil installations.

<TEXT>
   The 3,000 princes of the ruling Saud
family are the cement that holds the kingdom together. Most experts
agree any effective rebellion would have to be led from within the
family.
   The royal family controls every aspect of life, and has remained
united on the critical succession issue and important policy
matters.
   It has produced the Arab world's first astronaut, Prince Sultan
bin Salman, who flew on the U.S. space shuttle Discovery in 1984.
   Saudi Arabia's current rulers are descendants of King Abdulaziz
ibn Saud, who founded the kingdom in 1927 by conquering the desert
tribes of the Arabian Peninsula.
   The Saud family has been largely responsible for guiding a
tribal society of impoverished nomads into a cohesive modern state
whose oil wealth has made it a financial superpower.
   King Fahd, who has ruled since 1982, is believed to be the
world's second- richest person. Fortune Magazine estimated his
fortune in 1988 at $18 billion. The Sultan of Brunei is said to
worth several billion more.
   Fahd has a lavishly furnished Boeing 747, a $60 million yacht
protected by Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and luxury homes in
Spain, Britain and France.
   Secrecy surrounds the private life of the chain-smoking monarch,
who in his youth was a playboy prince known in Europe's gambling
clubs.
   He is 69, the fourth son of Abdulaziz to succeed his father, who
had 43 sons by 22 wives.
   After Crown Prince Abdullah, 67, and Defense Minister Sultan,
63, the succession is expected to go to the eldest of 20 younger
brothers who is considered able.
   The last son of Abdulaziz sons will have the job, with his inner
circle of princes called ``those who tie and untie,'' of selecting
the eldest, most respected from among the hundreds of male
grandchildren.
   Family members who break the rules are dealt with quickly and
firmly.
   One of Fahd's younger brothers, Prince Mishari, then 19, was
imprisoned in 1951 after shooting the British vice-consul in Jiddah
to death while drunk.
   In 1965, when King Saud's regime was discredited by widespread
corruption and the king's profligate and irrational decisions, the
family supported his overthrow in favor of the respected Faisal.
   After Faisal was assassinated by a deranged nephew on March 25,
1975, the crown passed quietly to Khaled, Fahd's half-brother. The
nephew was beheaded. Khaled died in June 1982.
   The only significant, independent move against a Saudi ruler
since the state was founded occurred under King Saud.
   A group of his younger brothers, critical of his misrule, were
influenced by Egypt's revolutionary leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
   Led by Prince Talal, they organized the ``Free Princes''
movement to dump Saud and create a constitutional monarchy. The
movement failed and the princes were exiled in 1962.
   Prince Turki, another of Fahd's brothers, was fired as deputy
defense minister in 1978 for drunkenness and an embarrassing
marriage to the daughter of Mohammed al-Fassi, a doctor.
   Al-Fassi relatives used Turki's money to buy a Hollywood
mansion, which was then painted lime green. They shocked even
Californians by highlighting the sexual organs of classical
statuary in bright orange.

Saudi Arabia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Most of Saudi Arabia's 865,000 square miles is
desert, with summer temperatures ranging up to 112 degrees
Fahrenheit. The Rub al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, is the world's
largest sand desert. The southwest has green, fertile valleys.

   THE PEOPLE _ About 3 million of the estimated 11 million
residents are foreign workers and one-third of native Saudis are
nomadic Bedouins or farmers living around oases. Roughly 90 percent
of native Saudis are Sunni Moslems of the Wahabi faction who live
by strictly enforced Islamic codes. King Fahd has taken the title
``Guardian of the Two Holy Shrines,'' Islam's most sacred shrines
at Mecca and Medina.

   THE ECONOMY _ Saudi Arabia has one-quarter of the world's known
oil reserves. Fifty years ago the country was poverty-stricken, but
it has used vast oil wealth to transform itself into modern state.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Islam swept the country in the 7th century, under the
leadership of the Prophet Mohammed. Later, the Ottoman Turks ruled
Saudi Arabia for 300 years. The British moved in during World War
I, when Lawrence of Arabia led desert warriors against the Turks.
Abdulaziz ibn Saud founded the modern state in 1927 after
conquering the desert tribes of the Arabian peninsula.

<HEAD>Volkswagen's Eye-Catching Corrado</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Think small, think fast and think agile when you think about the
1990 Volkswagen Corrado.
   This is a car that's small on the outside, surprisingly quick,
and an eye-catcher to boot.
   The Corrado marks something of a departure for Volkswagen, the
No. 1 carmaker in Europe. The car is designed, as Bill Young, vice
president in charge of VW-United States, put it, to change the way
you think about Volkswagen.
   Forget about the no-frills VWs of old. The Corrado is the first
to offer, at its initial debut in the market, a host of standard
features that would normally be optional on VW's: power windows,
air conditioning and heated outside mirrors. It's also the first VW
to have a tilt steering wheel.
   That's not all. The Corrado has a body by the same master
European coachbuilders who brought us the cute little Karmann Ghia
years ago _ plus a dashboard readout that details average fuel
economy, distance traveled and average speed just like the one you
would find in many luxury cars.
   Most impressively, the Corrado also is the quickest Volkswagen
ever, thanks to a special supercharger under the hood that spurs
the little four-cylinder engine up to 158 horsepower.
   Helping the performance, both in speed and fuel economy, is a
unique rear spoiler that rises automatically at 45 mph to help
ensure the car's speedy movement through air with a minimum of
rear-end lift. The spoiler begins to retract when speeds decline to
12 mph.
   The Corrado's sporty performance and well-packaged amenities
come at a base price of $17,900. Competitors include the Ford Probe
GT, which has a base price of $14,726; the Mitsubishi Eclipse GS
Turbo at $14,169, and the Toyota Celica GT-S at $16,268.
   One difference between the Corrado and many other competitors in
this segment, however, is the rear-seat room. VW says the Corrado's
rear seating area is a bit larger than most other, similar cars.
   Indeed, despite the test car's compact size _ a bit over 13 feet
long _ seating in back wasn't as bad as I feared. Though my view
was well-blocked by the front bucket seats and headrests and my
head brushed the ceiling, I found the sculpted seats to be very
comfortable, and legroom was OK with the front seat moved up a
ways. Legroom was at a minimum when the front seat was pushed all
the way back, although my knees still weren't touching the rear of
the front seats _ perhaps because the backs of the front bucket
seats were designed to slant inward.
   The rear seats are split one-third and two-thirds so they can be
folded down for more cargo space. But first, the rear center
armrest must be raised and set between the two front seats. Watch
when you replace the armrest in back so that you don't cover the
seat belt connectors.
   The Corrado also has a nice storage shelf that covers the hatch
area, if needed.
   The test car was fun to zip around in, and the power is
surprising. The car is rated at a quick 7.5 seconds for its 0-60
mph performance. Top speed is 140 mph.
   Yet the Corrado got good mileage, more than 24 mpg in mixed city
and highway driving during the test. The gearshift for the
five-speed manual transmission felt notchy but the transmission
worked well with the four-cylinder engine.
   The hatchback requires lifting items up and over the high rear
body of the car, and the storage space is raised slightly in the
middle, above the hidden spare tire compartment.
   The Corrado does not have airbags, but front-seat passengers do
get lap belts that automatically come across the body when the
ignition is activated.
   My complaints were minor: Having to use a large knob to recline
the bucket seats; a high-pitched squeak that seemed to come from
the lap belt connector on the driver side as I drove; no light in
the glovebox, and a dashboard parking brake light that stayed on
for nearly a block as I drove with a cold engine.
   VW has sold more than 2,000 of the cars since last fall's

   A late-starting Easter selling season and a
continuing auto slump combined to push retail sales down for the
second straight month in March, the government said.
   Sales fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $148.6 billion
after a 0.3 percent drop in February, the Commerce Department
reported Thursday. The drop was the steepest in five months and
marked the first back-to-back sales slump since October and
November 1986. Only food stores posted higher sales.

   Despite the absence of a major new fashion trend, shoppers are
giving this year's spring lines a warm reception, boosting business
for apparel stores.
   Retailers specializing in clothing outperformed mass merchandise
chains in March, according to reports released Thursday. Business
was only so-so for retailers overall, reflecting a later Easter
selling season this year, unsettled weather and generally sluggish
economic conditions.
   Fred Wintzer, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in
Baltimore, said the specialty apparel retailers he tracks have
indicated that their warm-weather collections appear to be popular
with shoppers.
   But he said nothing has taken the country by storm or caused
women to want to discard their old wardrobes in favor of newer
styles.
   ``The general feeling is that there's nothing hot out there _
there are no fashion trends,'' he said. He said this season's
offerings haven't sparked the shopping enthusiasm that the baggy
look did. That style, featuring oversized blazers, slacks and other
clothes designed for comfort, became the rage in 1984. Before that,
the preppy look was in vogue.
   Among stores selling exclusively apparel that reported their
March results Thursday, The Gap Inc. posted a 20 percent sales
jump. Sales at stores owned by the San Francisco-based retailer
open at least a year rose 12 percent.
   Results from stores open a year or longer _ known as same- or
comparable-store sales _ give a more accurate reading of a
retailer's performance.
   Baltimore-based Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc., which sells
trendy clothes for teenagers, said its total March sales surged 61
percent, due in part to acquisitions. But even excluding new stores
it had a strong month; same-store sales gained 32 percent.
   The Limited Inc., the biggest specialty apparel chain in the
country, said its sales rose 8 percent but were up a more modest 4
percent on a comparable store basis. The chain is based in
Columbus, Ohio.
   For more than a year, apparel-oriented retailers have done
better than general merchandise chains that devote much of their
business to costly durable goods. Subpar economic growth _ with
workers in some industries worried about layoffs _ have made
consumers cautious about spending heavily or going into debt to
finance expensive purchases.
   The government's retail sales report, also issued Thursday,
illustrated how a weak economy has flashed warning signals to
consumers. Outlays have been curbed by the Federal Reserve Board's
high interest rate policy aimed at diffusing inflationary pressures.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales fell a seasonally
adjusted 0.6 percent in March from February. The report covered
sales at a wide range of establishments including stores, auto
dealerships and restaurants.
   The largest chain reporting Thursday was K mart Corp., which
blamed the calendar shift for its so-so showing.
   The Troy, Mich.-based discounter, which ranked second in
nationwide sales volume last year behind Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
said total sales for the five weeks ended April 4 rose 8.6 percent.
But sales fell 1.1 percent at stores open at least a year.
   Last month's sales were compared with a strong March 1989, when
stores drew customers because of holiday promotions pushing
everything from spring clothing to candy. Easter fell on March 26
last year.
   ``Sales were strong in the first two weeks of March but, because
of the later date for Easter in 1990 than in 1989, sales weakened
in line with expectations in the latter part of the month,'' said K
mart Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph E. Antonini.
   Store executives and retail economists said April should turn
out to be a better month as holiday promotions capitalize on a
seasonal upsurge in demand for spring clothing and other
merchandise.
   Rosalind Wells, chief economist at the National Retail
Federation in New York, said, ``stores are looking forward to a
successful Easter sales period in April'' after an encouraging
March.
   Several major mass merchandisers, such as Sears, Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and others, already posted their March
sales a week ago. Overall, those results were sluggish. The
exceptions were the perennial star performer Wal-Mart and stores
concentrating on apparel, including Penney.

   Due to differing calendars, many of the major companies that in
recent years issued monthly results on the first Thursday of each
month now are reporting on the second Thursday. Several big chains,
including Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., issued
their March results last week.
   Some top retailers do not report their sales monthly, including:
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., the

<HEAD>Cattle Market Can Withstand Record Prices, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHIP BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rise of cattle futures prices to
record levels this week hasn't brought euphoria to the industry,
where memories are vivid of the beef-market crash that followed the
previous high's a decade ago.
   ``Everyone is running scared right now, and it's the best
thing,'' said Leon Miller, president of Eagle Pass-based Alta Verde
Industries, one of the nation's top 20 cattle producers.
   ``Everyone remembers what happened when prices shot up last
time. If producers just keep selling, especially with the prices
up, the market will continue to stabilize,'' Miller said.
   Live cattle futures reached a record price for the second
consecutive day Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile exchange, with
the April contract finishing at $80.42 per hundredweight, up from
Wednesday's $80.40.
   The previous high before this week _ $80.25 per hundred pounds
of beef in 1979 _ lasted only briefly before prices plummeted about
25 percent.
   Although producers are mindful of that crash, they say the
market now isn't as vulnerable to a similar turnaround.
   Today's record prices reflect a seasonal peak in demand for beef
and supply tightness stemming from delayed cattle marketings
because of dry pastures in the Southern Plains last fall and winter.
   ``We have a completely different situation,'' said Tommy Beall,
director of research for Cattle-Fax, a Denver-based market analysis
company for the cattle.
   ``The economics are different. The prices we have seen recently
accurately reflect the state of the industry. The prices in 1979
did not,'' he said.
   Beall said liquidation by producers leaving the industry over
the past decade has tightened the cattle supply and forced prices
up.
   The supply situation was much different in 1979, when inflated
prices and overpopulated feed yards gave producers a false sense of
security.
   ``Producers took females out of the slaughter and placed them in
the breeding herds to multiply and cash in on the high prices back
then,'' Miller said.
   ``Suddenly we had too many head of cattle and the bottom fell
out,'' Miller said.
   The 1979 crash caused prices to plummet from $80 per
hundredweight to the $60 range in a matter of weeks.
   That drop, combined with rising production and grain costs and
dry conditions, have reduced the number of cattle head by 16
million since the mid-1980s, Beall said.
   ``The industry is still recovering from the price drop,'' said
Jim Gill, a market analyst for the Texas Cattle Feeders'
Association in Amarillo. ``The tight supply of cattle right now
reflects the changes in the industry since the sharp drop in
prices.''
   Feeders and analysts agree that a new selling philosophy of
``expect less for cattle tomorrow than what you can get today,''
has helped insure the market against another break-off, Miller said.
   Industry officials said today's record futures prices would not
affect retail beef costs because futures prices had been around the
$80 mark for two months.
   ``The retail price increase has already been passed on to the
consumer,'' Miller said. ``When futures prices jumped from about
$74 to where they are now in February there was an increase in a
few cents per cut.''
   Most industry officials expect prices will ease in the next two
months, when grazing conditions are expected to improve and cattle
can be beefed up more quickly. But declines should be moderate,
they say.
   ``I would expect the price to land at about 75 or $76 by June,''
said Milton Rudder, vice president of AzTx Cattle Co. based in
Hereford. ``The number of cattle ready to be sold will increase
significantly.''

<HEAD>Conner Out at Winnebago Less than Four Months After Being Named

<TEXT>
   A familiar figure is back in charge of
day-to-day operations at slumping Winnebago Industries after
directors of the recreational vehicle maker fired another president.
   The board of Winnebago fired Richard Conner on Thursday and said
its executive committee had designated the company's chairman,
founder and principal stockholder, John K. Hanson, as acting chief
executive.
   Conner had been president and chief executive for less than four
months and became the fifth president dismissed by the board since
1976.
   There was no elaboration and neither Hanson nor Conner was
available for comment, said Sheila Davis, a spokeswoman at
Winnebago's Forest City headquarters. Calls to Conner's home were
not returned.
   The shakeup followed a series of recent setbacks for the
company. Still, Wall Street appeared to shrug off the news.
   Winnebago closed unchanged at $5.12{ a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   ``There's been an awful lot of bad news recently,'' said Frank
Rolfes, an analyst who follows Winnebago for the Minneapolis
securities firm of Dain Bosworth. ``It's not like this is the first
piece of bad news we've seen. ... The stock probably has bottomed
out.''
   Among recent problems the company:
   _ Reported a loss of nearly $10 million, or 40 cents a share,
for the six months ended Feb. 24, compared with a profit of $6.3
million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The
market for its main product, recreational vehicles, has been
sluggish.
   _ Disclosed it sold its portfolio of marketable securities and
IOUs from dealers to reduce short-term debt when it could not
negotiate the interest rates it wanted from its lenders.
   _ Has struggled to make a go of its Cycle-Sat subsidiary, which
Conner once headed and which delivers television commercials to
stations via satellite.
   The dismissal of Conner, who was named president Dec. 15, is a
sign Winnebago is ``having trouble finding someone who runs the
company the way John K. wants,'' Rolfes said.
   Hanson, 76, has a controlling interest in the company's stock.
   ``On the surface, it doesn't look really good,'' said Richard L.
Hanley, who heads an independent New York research firm bearing his
own name. ``Reading between the lines, it is not any great
negative.''
   Hanley said Winnebago does have several positive factors in its
favor. It is nearly debt-free and has widespread recognition of its
brands in the recreational vehicle market, which leave it in good
position to capitalize on any rebound in the market for motor homes.
   He also said that despite Conner's ties to Cycle-Sat, company
officials indicated his dismissal is not a signal of that venture's
demise.
   Hanley said he thinks Conner's dismissal was related to the
recent return of two former executives to take over product
development and marketing. Winnebago realized ``it didn't need an
active chief executive officer,'' he said.
   The executives are Rex Miner, who returned after an absence of
10 years to be head of product development, and Ronald Jacobson,
who was appointed vice president of sales and marketing.
   Both executives moved to those positions when Conner became
president late last year.
   ``It looks to me like the old regime coming back,'' Hanley said.

<HEAD>Murdoch Says Buying Spree is Over, Plans to Build Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media baron Rupert Murdoch says he is intent on
improving earnings at News Corp. Ltd. and has no plans for more big
acquisitions.
   The Australian-based News Corp. secured its place over the past
decade among the global communications powerhouses partly by buying
a U.S. movie studio, several television stations, magazines and
book companies.
   But the acquisitions of the Twentieth Century Fox, Metromedia TV
stations, TV Guide and Harper &amp; Row Publishers, as well as costs in
starting the Fox TV network and the British satellite-TV service
Sky Television, have left the company with a debt of more than $6
billion.
   Murdoch disclosed his plans to forgo major acquisitions and
focus on earnings improvement and the company's current businesses
in an interview published Thursday in The Wall Street Journal. He
confirmed some of the details of that account by telephone.
   ``We are not going to purchase anything major,'' the chief
executive of News Corp. said in the phone interview.
   ``We are sorting out our portfolio of media assets. Our main
concentration is going to be on developing our earnings,'' he said.
   Only a year ago, Murdoch was planning to create a second company
that would be used as an acquisition vehicle. But the investment
banker was able to line up only about half of the $1 billion sought
and Murdoch dropped the plan.
   News Corp. reported in February that its earnings tumbled 67
percent to $117 million in the six months ended Dec. 31, 1989, even
as its revenue rose 8.3 percent to $3.17 billion.
   It cited startup losses in Sky Television, higher interest
expense and the impact of a labor dispute involving its airline in
Australia.
   The company's stock also has been trading at relatively low
levels.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, News Corp.'s American
depositary receipts finished unchanged at $16.50 Thursday. The ADRs
have traded in a range of between $14.87{ and $27.12{ over the past
52 weeks. Each ADR is equivalent to two common shares of News Corp.
stock.
   Murdoch said one of his top priorities would be Sky Television,
which offers four channels of programming and has 450,000 paid
subscribers in the Britain.
   The service, launched last year, already has cost about $400
million and may cost another $150 million or more before it reaches
the break-even point of 2 million paid subscribers late next year,
Murdoch said.
   The service has been adding about 20,000 new subscribers a week,
he said, partly because Sky Television changed its marketing plans
to allow people to rent the receiving dishes rather than buy them.
   Sky Television may soon face competition, however, from a rival
service from British Satellite Broadcasting Corp.
   News Corp. is among four companies attempting to reach agreement
on launching an 108-channel satellite TV service in the United
States. The service, Sky Cable, tentatively is scheduled to start
operations in late 1993.
   Murdoch said he has no plans to make any major asset sales,
although he said there may be sales of ``some minor activities''
such as in book retailing or distribution.
   The company announced in late March an agreement to sell Star
magazine, a supermarket tabloid that features heavy doses of
celebrity gossip along with health and beauty tips, for at least
$400 million in cash and preferred stock to G.P. Group Inc., the
publisher of the archrival weekly, The National Enquirer.
   Media analyst Peter Appert of the investment firm C.J. Lawrence,
Morgan Grenfell, said he expected the investment community would
take a positive view of Murdoch's plans to try to improve earnings.
   ``From a strategic standpoint, it probably makes sense for them
to try to digest some of these properties. They are not precluded
from going back to the acquisition marketplace at some time in the
future,'' he said.

   Fraud may have accounted for as much as 80 percent
of the losses at the nation's failed savings and loans, regulators
said, citing a ``predominance of lavish lifestyles'' among thrift
insiders.
   Regulators and prosecutors also cautioned that it is difficult
to prosecute wrongdoers, and may be harder still to recover
substantial portions of the losses.
   Nevertheless, the chairman of the House Banking Committee said
he was satisfied with government efforts to track down fraud at
banks and thrifts.
   ``They have done as much as is humanly possible to do,'' Rep.
Henry B. Gonzalez said Thursday after ending two days of committee
hearings in Dallas.
   The San Antonio Democrat had convened the hearings to examine
how effective federal agencies had been in finding and prosecuting
fraud in the troubled financial industry.
   ``I don't think that the extent and depth of the problem is
realized even now,'' he said.
   Gonzalez warned that although much of the focus has been on
Texas, the problems already are showing up in the Northeast and
elsewhere.
   Several times during the hearings witnesses were asked to
quantify the industry losses attributed to fraud. Their estimates
ranged from 10 percent to 80 percent.
   William K. Black, an attorney for the Office of Thrift
Supervision in San Francisco, suggested that when fraudulent
activity leads to an institution's insolvency, the entire loss
should be blamed on fraud.
   As an example, he cited Vernon Savings and Loan Association,
closed in 1987 in a then-record $1.2 billion federal bailout.
   Seven Vernon executives, including a former president and former
chairman, along with three affiliated individuals have been found
guilty of various crimes including misapplication of funds and bank
fraud.
   ``Vernon was front-to-back fraud,'' Black said.
   James E. Cooper, deputy director of the Dallas office of the
Resolution Trust Corp., said fraud was present in as much as 80
percent of failed Texas and Oklahoma thrifts.
   ``Our preliminary investigations have revealed instances of
insider abuse and misconduct ranging from embezzlement and simple
loan fraud to complex conspiracies and schemes to defraud
institutions,'' Cooper said.
   ``We noted a predominance of lavish lifestyles, plush
accoutrements, expensive automobiles, artwork, airplanes and
compensation incentives benefiting insiders at the expense of
stockholders and depositors,'' he said.
   The hearings were held in Dallas in part because the city has
been the center of much of the activity and has the largest task
force investigating bank and thrift crimes.
   Witnesses included FBI Director William Sessions, three Texas
U.S. attorneys, plus current and former regulators from both state
and federal agencies.
   Most said last year's Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery
and Enforcement Act had provided adequate resources to find and
prosecute the fraud.
   But the three Texas U.S. attorneys called for more judges to
hear the expected increase in fraud cases.
   ``We can pour more cases in the funnel but every case must pass
through the narrow neck of the judiciary,'' said Marvin S. Collins,
U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas.
   The witnesses agreed that the complexity of the fraud makes it
difficult to prosecute. In addition, many of those charged are
prominent members of the community, making convictions difficult
unless the evidence against them is overwhelming, they said.
   ``Unless we are able to put some money, a lot of money, in
somebody's pocket ... it is very difficult to convict them,''
Collins said.
   The witnesses also warned there may be little chance to recover
some losses.
   Rep. Thomas Carper, D-Del., and Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, both
urged prosecutors to seek as much restitution as possible.
   But U.S. Attorney Henry K. Oncken of Houston said, ``It is my
opinion that expectations of vast amounts of restitution and high
fines that are collectible may be overly optimistic. Many of the
cases being investigated involve real estate ventures that used up
large amounts of cash to keep them going.
   ``When the real estate market fell, there wasn't much cash and
the value of the land, buildings or other real property (put up as
collateral) were greatly diminished,'' Oncken said.
   ``People in jail don't pay a lot of restitution,'' Collins said.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp.'s Federated and Allied retailers
have won approval to start a two-year, $25 million plan designed to
keep key managers from leaving for other jobs.
   Creditors of the two companies, which are operating under
federal bankruptcy court protection, went along with the plan
Thursday. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. gave his
approval.
   The plan is designed to benefit about 2,300 managers of
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
nationwide, from senior executives to divisional merchandise
managers. It would provide a core of about 400 key executives with
performance bonuses, job security assurances and employment and
severance agreement terms.
   Aug also approved payment of about $1.5 million in 1989
performance bonuses to 396 executives of both divisions. The
Cincinnati-based retailers have 260 stores and 100,000 employees in
28 states.
   The companies have been required to seek Aug's approval for
spending since they filed Jan. 15 for Chapter 11 protection from
creditors. The companies listed $7.7 billion in debts acquired when
Campeau bought them in 1986 and 1988.
   The judge postponed a ruling on the request by Allied and
Federated to hire Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. as a financial
adviser. The retailers said they need the advice of the Wall Street
house to work through the reorganization.
   Shearson did work for the retailers in February and March and
needs to be hired formally to collect $500,000 in fees, lawyers for
Allied and Federated said.
   But U.S. Trustee Conrad J. Morgenstern objected, saying Shearson
should be disqualified under federal bankruptcy law from serving as
a consultant because it underwrote Federated-Allied securities
prior to the companies' Jan. 15 filing.
   David Heiman, a lawyer for Federated and Allied, acknowledged
the bond underwriting but said it was ``ancient history'' that
occurred three years ago and would not affect Shearson's ability to
serve.
   Aug postponed resolution of the matter until a hearing April 26,
when he is to hear further testimony.
   The judge also approved a request by Allied and its Allied
Stores Marketing Corp. subsidiary to get out of a lease on six
floors of office space in New York City, where Allied maintained
its corporate headquarters until moving last year to Cincinnati. He
did so over objections by New York businessman Robert Arnow, who
leased the space to Allied for about $300,000 a month under a
25-year lease that was to run through 1997.
   Allied said it no longer needs the space and that continuing to
make lease payments could reduce the value of Allied's estate for
creditors.
   The judge also heard a plea on behalf of about 40 retired senior
executives of Allied and Federated or their surviving spouses, who
said some of their benefits had been stopped since the companies
filed the reorganization petitions. Lawyer Jeff Ireland presented
the claim behalf of former executives including ex-Federated
chairman Howard Goldfeder and three members of the Lazarus family,
which founded Federated and its Lazarus department store group.
   Members of the group are continuing to receive regular,
federally protected pensions and medical insurance coverage,
officials said. But Ireland said Allied and Federated have
suspended other retirement benefits including supplemental
pensions, deferred compensation and retirement allowances.
   Lawyers for Allied and Federated said they are aware of the
retirees' claims and are trying to provide for them in the
companies' reorganization plan. The lawyers declined to say when
the reorganization plan will be filed.

<TEXT>
   The Bank of New England Corp. announced an
agreement to sell its mutual fund custody business to Investors
Bank &amp; Trust Co.
   The two companies have completed an agreement on principle to
exchange the business for an undisclosed sum, bank officials said
Thursday. Bank of New England currently oversees mutual funds
valued at $22 billion.
   Investor's Bank, which is 77.3 percent controlled by the
Boston-based interstate bank Eaton Vance Corp., already holds
custody assets worth an estimated $9 billion.
   The Bank of New England lost more than $1 billion last year,
primarily due to its aggressive real estate lending policies in an
overheated market. In response to its economic woes, bank officials
have announced plans to sell off approximately $8 billion in assets.
   This week the bank sold its asset-based lending operations
located outside New England, valued at about $665 million, to
National Bank of Canada. That transaction brought the total value
of the bank's assets sold so far to more than $3.5 billion.

<HEAD>Cartel Weighs Urgent Meeting To Stop Oil Price Drop; Analysts
Skeptical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices continued to gyrate after
OPEC's acting president said the cartel ministers were considering
holding an emergency meeting in an effort to halt the slide in
world oil prices.
   Rumors that OPEC might call an early meeting to deal with the
declines, which have trimmed as much as $6 off the price of a
barrel in recent weeks, helped support the market on Wednesday.
   But on Thursday prices kept fluctuating wildly and in late
trading were down from Wednesday's close.
   Analysts said they were skeptical the oil ministers would take
effective steps against the recent steep price drop and predicted
weak prices over the near term.
   ``I think it's really all noise and very little action,'' said
Geoff Pyne, an oil analyst with the London investment firm UBS
Philips and Drew.
   Prices have fallen more sharply than usual during the
traditional spring slump, when demand generally drops among
consumer nations. Analysts blame the recent price drop on
overproduction by some OPEC members.
   Acting OPEC President Sadek Boussena said Thursday he had been
conducting ``intensive consultations'' with his fellow ministers
about the price slide.
   Options under consideration included an urgent meeting of the
eight-member ministerial monitoring committee and an extraordinary
meeting of all 13 members, he said.
   OPEC's monitoring committee studies oil market conditions and
makes policy recommendations to the full OPEC conference. While it
formally has only the eight members, its sessions tend to be
attended by all OPEC ministers.
   The acting president, who is Algeria's oil minister, made the
comments in an official statement released Thursday by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' Vienna secretariat.
   OPEC's 13 oil ministers have a full meeting scheduled for May 25
to set their output and price for the second half of the year.
   Nick Clayton, an analyst with Smith New Court PLC, predicted the
ministers would gather in early May. But Pyne said he did not
believe they would meet before May 25 unless prices fell further.
   Boussena's statement is ``a recognition that there are
difficulties in the oil market,'' Clayton said.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, stood at $15.45 a barrel late Thursday,
unchanged from late Wednesday. The price stood at $18.45 a barrel
on March 16.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate crude finished down 28 cents from Wednesday at
$17.78 a barrel. By comparison, the near-month contract for WTI
settled at $24.20 on Jan. 22.
   The average price of a basket of seven crude oils monitored by
OPEC was $17.12 a barrel in the first week of April, off from
$17.26 in the last week of March and below the cartel's minimum
reference price of $18 a barrel.
   ``Stocks are very high. OPEC has been producing too much for too
long and the obvious reaction was that prices have to fall,''
Clayton said.
   The cartel's production last week came to just over 24.5 million
barrels a day, well over OPEC's cap of 22.1 million barrels a day
for the January-June period, estimated Peter Gignoux, director of
the international energy department at Shearson Lehman Hutton in
London.
   ``It will be quite difficult to think of some mechanism by which
they can reduce output,'' Pyne said. No member country is willing
to take on the burden, he said.
   ``In the near-term there will be continual soft outlook for the
markets,'' Pyne said. But demand should start to pick up in early
May, he said.
   OPEC's members are Algeria, Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, Ecuador, Gabon,
Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela,
Libya, Qatar, Kuwait.

<HEAD>Judge Fines Trading Firm for Securities Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange
was fined $480,350 for securities fraud by a judge who said he
imposed the sentence as a deterrent.
   ``The trading while in possession of confidential material is a
crime.'' U.S. District Judge Charles Haight said Thursday at the
sentencing of Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. ``It constitutes an affront to
the fair operation of the marketplace.''
   Prosecutors said Marcus Schloss was the first NYSE firm to be
convicted of felony charges related to insider trading.
   The company was convicted last July of conspiracy to trade on
inside information and of securities fraud in connection with its
March 1986 purchase of stock in American Brands Inc. It was
acquitted of securities fraud charges for stock trades involving
three other companies.
   Marcus Schloss could have been fined a maximum of $1 million _
$500,000 for each of two counts.
   Haight, however, said he only considered a fine of $500,000
because both charges stemmed from the American Brands deal.
   From that amount, the judge said he subtracted $19,650 which the
company previously paid the Securities and Exchange Commission to
settle civil charges stemming from the American Brands trade.
   The SEC settlement, reached in February 1988, involved other
trades and required Marcus Schloss to pay a total of $410,000.
   The firm's lawyer, Marvin Schwartz, said the SEC settlement was
the company's ``plain acknowledgement of wrongdoing.'' He told the
judge that any additional fine would ``be in the nature of a double
hit.''
   Marcus Schloss' former head of arbitrage, D. Ronald Yagoda, was
tried with the firm but was acquitted of all charges, including
perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with an SEC
inquiry.
   Schwartz has said he will appeal the company's conviction on the
grounds that it was inconsistent to convict the firm on conduct for
which Yagoda was acquitted.
   The government had charged that Yagoda received inside
information on pending stock transactions from Andrew Solomon, a
former Marcus Schloss analyst.
   Solomon was part of the ``Yuppie Five'' ring. In 1986, Solomon,
three other young Wall Street professionals and a client pleaded
guilty to trading on inside information about corporate takeovers
that they had obtained through their jobs.
   Marcus Schloss and Yagoda were indicted in 1988 along with two
Wall Street arbitragers, who were convicted last week at a separate
trial.
   Victor Teicher, 38, who headed the arbitrage firm Teicher &amp; Co.,
and Ross Frankel, 33, former head of arbitrage research at
now-defunct investment house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., were
found guilty of 18 counts of securities fraud, conspiracy and mail
fraud.
   Teicher and Frankel were convicted of trading the stocks of
eight corporations based on stolen information.
   They were to be sentenced by Haight in June.

<HEAD>Federal Government Sues Honeywell, Alleging Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $48 million federal lawsuit against
Honeywell Inc. and Unisys Corp. alleges that a Sperry Aerospace
operation Honeywell bought from Unisys in 1986 has been defrauding
the Navy for the past 11 years.
   The business, which Honeywell resold in 1988, repeatedly
inflated its estimated cost for flight simulators used to train
pilots of F-18 and T-45 jets, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday
by the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y.
   The suit seeks $48 million in claims on government contracts,
which is triple the government's alleged loss of $16 million. It
also seeks $5,000 to $10,000 for each allegedly false claim for
payment that was submitted to the government.
   Tim Morin, a Honeywell spokesman, said the firm had not seen a
copy of the suit and declined to comment.
   The simulator suit involves a business unit that
Minneapolis-based Honeywell owned from 1986 to 1988, although the
alleged fraud occurred over a period extending back to the late
1970s. During that time the business unit was owned first by
Sperry, based in New York, and later by Detroit-based Unisys, which
was formed when Sperry was acquired by Burroughs Corp. in 1986.
   The government's suit claims that in 1979, Sperry deliberately
underestimated the cost of an initial project for the F-18
simulator, hoping to obtain the contract for it and later projects.
It succeeded in winning those contracts but then concealed its true
estimates of what the later projects cost, the suit says.
   Instead, the suit says, executives padded the cost estimate by
as much as 30 percent, presenting the higher numbers to the Navy
and concealing the added amounts in labor charges.
   The suit says documents showing the added dollars were
distributed to a committee of company executives then collected
after each committee meeting.
   The result was inflated contract prices awarded by the
government, the lawsuit alleges.
   The suit alleges the flight simulator project for the T-45 was
similarly inflated.
   Officials at the U.S. Attorney's office said the suit was filed
in Brooklyn federal court because the alleged fraudulent activities
occurred in corporate offices in the New York area.
   The suit is the third legal obstacle Honeywell has encountered
as a result of acquiring the Sperry Aerospace operations.
   The first episode involved hidden contract cost-accounting
problems in the Albuquerque, N.M., military aerospace operations.
Those problems were mainly responsible for Honeywell's record loss
of $435 million in 1988. As a result of those problems, Honeywell
in 1988 sued Unisys for more than $350 million, mostly over alleged
misstatements about the financial condition of the Sperry Aerospace
operations.
   The second episode arose last year when the government sued
Honeywell and Unisys for about $48 million over alleged contract
violations at operations in Albuquerque.
   Honeywell has said a significant part of that suit involves
alleged incidents that occurred before it bought the operations
from Unisys. Damages for the period before Honeywell's ownership
would be covered by a contract clause under which Unisys would bear
the costs for its period of ownership, Morin said.

   President Bush and his wife Barbara paid
$101,382 in federal income taxes last year and reported charitable
contributions of $37,272 that included gifts to hurricane and
earthquake relief efforts.
   A copy of the first couple's joint 1989 federal return, released
Thursday by the White House, showed that the Bushes reported total
income of $456,780.
   Both taxes and income were up sharply from the couple's 1988
return on which they reported total income of $287,171 and taxes of
$62,106.
   The higher income came from Bush's better pay as president _
$200,000 a year against his $115,000 vice presidential salary _ and
from a growth in business investments.
   The Bushes' tax return showed that the Bushes earned $208,274
last year from business holdings held in a blind trust, up from the
$155,662 the trust earned the previous year.
   By contrast, Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn,
made less in 1989 than in 1988, but paid more in federal taxes.
   The Quayles, whose return was released by his office, paid taxes
of $25,479 on a total income of $133,696. The year before, they
paid $24,314 on a total income of $156,546.
   Quayle's 1988 income was boosted by nearly $53,000 in speaking
honoraria earned while he was a senator _ much of which was given
to charities. Because he claimed fewer tax-deductible contributions
in 1989, his overall tax liability rose.
   Bush, who has energetically lobbied Congress to lower the
capital gains tax, paid taxes on $36,068 in capital gains posted by
the blind trust. The trust, which masks the first family's
investment portfolio, was established in 1981 when Bush became vice
president.
   The joint tax return filed by the president and his wife listed
$94,702 in itemized deductions.
   Among the contributions was $3,000 in cash for relief
organizations to help victims of Hurricane Hugo in the Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico and South Carolina. An additional $1,500 was
donated to similar efforts in the aftermath of the San
Francisco-area earthquake.
   Bush divided profits of $14,282 from his biography, ``Looking
Forward,'' between two charities: the United Negro College Fund in
New York and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center of Houston.
   In all, the Bushes gave $8,141 to the black educational fund _
their largest contribution. They also gave $5,000 to a private fund
that is building a new chapel at Camp David, the presidential
retreat in the Maryland mountains.
   Through a quirk of job and geography, Bush paid no state or city
income tax.
   Texas, his adopted home state, has no income tax. He doesn't
spend enough time at his oceanside home in Maine to be required to
pay taxes there, according to White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. The District of Colombia exempts the president from its
income tax.
   Most of Quayle's income consisted of his government salary _
$106,528 as vice president and $3,715 as vice president-elect
before the Jan. 20 inaugural. He resigned as a senator from Indiana
on Jan. 2, 1989.
   Although the Quayles hold assets valued at more than $1.4
million, the vice president showed relatively small business
earnings in 1989. They reported $14,572 in dividends on family
stock holdings in Central Newspapers Inc. Quayle also reported
$1,858 in interest earnings on various savings accounts.
   The Quayles claimed a $5,435 loss in renting their house in
McLean, Va., a Washington suburb. Aides said the loss came because
the house was on the market for several months before the Quayles
found a renter. They now live in the official vice presidential
residence.

   Falling gasoline and vegetable prices pushed
wholesale prices down 0.2 percent in March, the first drop in seven
months, the government said today.
   The decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
followed no change in February and a huge 1.8 percent gain in
January.
   A cold snap in December caused the January price spurt by
killing Gulf Coast vegetable crops and producing a fuel oil
shortage.
   Energy prices began their recovery in February and were joined
by food prices last month.
   For the first quarter, overall prices advanced at an annual rate
of 6.7 percent, well above the 4.8 percent rise for all of last
year. However, analysts expect wholesale inflation for 1990 will be
a little below last year's rate. They anticipate continued declines
for food and energy in the next few months.
   ``We'll probably get further downard pressure, especially in
energy, in April,'' said economist James Annable of First National
Bank of Chicago. ``When we get into the spring, we're going to see
that inflation is running about where it has been running, which is
about 4.5 percent.''
   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Commerce Department said
business inventories fell 0.4 percent in February while sales
surged 1.3 percent. The report was taken as a sign of strength.
Rising inventories can signal a recession.
   The March wholesale inflation report was better than expected.
Most economists had predicted a slight increase of 0.1 percent or
0.2 percent.
   Food prices dropped 0.6 percent in March, the sharpest decline
since June. Vegetables, particularly tomatoes, celery and cabbage,
declined 25.5 percent, the biggest drop on record going back to
1967. However, that marked only a partial recovery from gains of
23.3 percent in February and 58 percent in January.
   Prices also fell for beef and veal, dairy products and coffee.
They rose for eggs, rice, pasta, pork, chickens, turkeys, fish,
soft drinks and cooking oils.
   Energy prices overall dropped 2.4 percent in March following a
fall of 5 percent in February and an increase of 13.6 percent in
January.
   Gasoline was down 2.8 percent and natural gas declined 2.5
percent. Fuel oil prices went up 10.6 percent, but they had fallen
30.2 percent the month before.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose a
moderate 0.3 percent in March following gains of 0.4 percent in
February and 0.1 percent in January. Economists look to these
so-called core prices as a better indication of underlying
inflationary pressures.
   Clothing prices for men and children rose, while the cost of
women's clothing fell. Passenger car prices, in the face of weak
auto sales, declined 0.3 percent in March after no change in
February and a 0.7 percent fall in January.
   The various changes put the index for all finished goods, one
stop short of retail, at 117.0 in March. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods which cost $100 in 1982 cost $117 last month, up
from $112.10 a year earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also
eased in March. Intermediate goods showed no change while crude
goods fell 1.4 percent. An example of the three processing stages
would be bread for finished goods, flour for intermediate and wheat
for crude.
   The moderate inflation report should please the Federal Reserve
Board which has been using relatively high interest rates to dampen
demand and thus cool inflation.
   But, analysts cautioned against reading too much into recent
months' numbers, which have been sent on a roller-coaster ride by
the effect of the weather on food and energy prices.
   ``The numbers in the next few months could give us a false sense
of euphoria just as the number in January gave us a false sense of
gloom,'' said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago.

<HEAD>Whirlpool Provides Lesson in European Expansion Drive</HEAD>

   When American appliance king Whirlpool Corp.
wanted to expand into Europe as part of a strategy to dominate the
world market, it ran into the business version of a rough spin
cycle.
   The company found that although its name was a household world
in the United States, few Europeans had heard of or could even
pronounce the brand. Its big and American identity was no selling
point either.
   So Whirlpool sought a kindred spirit on this side of the
Atlantic.
   By entering a joint venture with the Dutch electronics giant NV
Philips and adopting a pan-European marketing strategy, Whirlpool
may provide a valuable lesson for other U.S. companies hoping to
get inside the trade barrier-free Europe planned for the end of
1992.
   ``Our ultimate goal by the end of this century is to emblazon
the Whirlpool brand supreme around the world,'' Jan Karel, managing
director of the joint venture, told a convention of appliance
dealers in France in January.
   Early last year, Whirlpool acquired a 53 percent stake in
Philips' major domestic appliance business for $470 million. It
makes Whirlpool the world's No. 1 maker of major domestic
appliances, the company says, and gets it into the European market
of 320million consumers without having to start from scratch.
   Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., had $4 billion in
annual sales but none in Europe. It obtained instant access to
Philips' $2 billion worth of European domestic appliance sales.
   The joint venture, called Whirlpool International BV, is based
in Comerio, Italy, and employs 14,000 people. It has become the
first company to sell a single brand of domestic appliances across
Europe, an appliance market highly fragmented with a range of brand
names and varying standards.
   Under the agreement, Whirlpool can use the Philips brand name
until the end of the decade.
   After a year of research and development, Whirlpool has decided
to use the name Philips Whirlpool, and will gradually drop the name
Philips, one country at a time.
   ``Whirlpool is virtually unknown,'' said Derek Smith, editor of
the British weekly Electrical and Radio Trading. ``Frankly, I can't
think of what else they would have done, given that Philips is a
well-established brand in Europe, and the U.K. particularly.''
   Whirlpool has had past success with what is known in the
industry as ``transitional dual branding.''
   During the 1950s it acquired the air conditioning and electric
stove businesses of Radio Corporation of America and called these
products RCA Whirlpool for 12 years before dropping the RCA.
   For its latest branding attempt, Whirlpool's Paris-based
advertising agency, Publicis FCS International, devised seven
candidate advertising campaigns in three languages after hiring
researchers to interview a total of more than 1,000 women consumers
in Britain, France, Austria and Spain.
   The research helped the company learn the common denominators,
and what to avoid.
   Nick Mote, Publicis' international coordinator for the account,
said, ``It is difficult. It took us a year of development to find
the key to the door. We wanted to be as broadly appealing as
possible.''
   Whirlpool wanted to target housewives rather than professional
women working outside the home, who are proliferating in Germany
but remain a relative novelty elsewhere in Europe.
   Because Whirlpool is hard to pronounce in Spanish or French, the
company decided to go with the English pronunciation.
   The researchers found that the women interviewed were skeptical
that the company's large size would guarantee quality, and they
discovered strong anti-American sentiment among the British and
Austrian women.
   ``They associated American with the disposable society and not
technology,'' Mote said.
   The end result is a $100 million ``Philips Whirlpool Brings
Quality to Life'' ad campaign launched in mid-February.
   The first television ad, shown in 14 European countries, looks
futuristic, with a touch of magic. It shows a young mother entering
a transparent kitchen made opaque by a golden swirl. The Whirlpool
name and logo are spoken and shown repeatedly, with no reference to
the United States or the company's size.
   A dark-haired actress was chosen because brunettes are spread
throughout Europe, and blondes aren't. Even her outfit was a
headache, because skirts are shorter in France than Spain. She wore
pants because the chosen skirt turned out too tight.
   ``You could alienate a lot of people if you went too sexy,''
said Brian Kennerley, managing director of Whirlpool (U.K.) Ltd.
   Asked his opinion of the campaign, a buyer for a major British
department store chain said, ``People thought that Philips
Whirlpool was a product. They think it is a Jacuzzi or a special
product as opposed to a brand.''
   The buyer, who requested anonymity, added, ``It occurred to me
that it might have been better to promote it Whirlpool Philips ...
to avoid confusion.''
   Whirlpool says it went with Philips Whirlpool because Philips
already is a well-known name in Europe.
   It says the Whirlpool brand is catching on more quickly than it
had hoped. ``There is a total acceptance,'' Kennerley said. ``I'm
not sure we need to go beyond two or three years'' with the dual
name.

<HEAD>Some See a Sneaky ``Soft Landing''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you don't like the way the economy looks on
the charts of Wall Street economists, just wait an hour or two.
   In keeping with the spring weather in the environs of New York
City, the prevailing forecast of the business and investment
outlook seems especially changeable right now.
   Within the past few weeks alone, recession fears have faded amid
signs of gradually reviving growth, only to be replaced by new
worries about a slump induced by a shrinking supply of credit.
   Consumers, meanwhile, are variously portrayed as all spent out,
restocking their depleted pocketbooks, or ready to launch a new
assault on the malls.
   Some observers believe all this turbulence may have distracted
the attention of many participants in the stock and bond markets
from a favorable development of more than passing significance.
   It is just possible, they say, that the economy has experienced
its long-awaited ``soft landing'' almost unnoticed.
   If that is indeed the case, Federal Reserve-watchers add, people
who worry that the Fed is trapped in a tight spot between the
conflicting perils of inflation and recession could be missing an
important point.
   They suggest that the Fed may be avoiding any overt changes in
its credit policy right now simply because it is satisfied, maybe
even pleased, with the way things stand.
   It is axiomatic in the financial world that whenever things are
moving in a favorable direction, there is usually some prominent
and highly publicized worry to serve as a sort of smoke screen.
   In the optimists' view, that purpose is being fulfilled right
now by talk of a ``credit crunch'' arising from a risk-averse mood
among bankers and other would-be lenders, including those who once
were eager buyers of junk bonds.
   ``If tougher lending practices are now producing a serious
credit crunch, then an economy-wide recession could unfold,'' says
Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``However, we aren't convinced that the current credit crunch is
severe enough to cause an economy-wide recession.
   ``Low-quality borrowers, who need to finance very risky
activities, are being turned away by the bankers. But that leaves
more lendable funds available for high-quality borrowers.''
   Or as Kevin Logan at Swiss Bank Corp. puts it: ``Business
borrowing is stronger than many people think, and economic growth
may be more robust than many expect. Credit crunch? Don't bet on
it.''
   Given the uncertain climate of recent days, many stock traders
seem unwilling to stake much either for or against such a
possibility. But the market did manage to post some spotty gains in
the past week before shutting down Thursday night for a long
holiday weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 34.68 points to
2,751.80, on top of a 9.91 advance the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.02 to
188.80; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 5.41 to 436.31, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index dropped 3.13 to 357.88.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 133.63 million shares, against
143.97 million in the previous week.
   A steady-as-she-goes approach ``is likely to remain the thrust
of Fed policy for quite some time,'' maintains Paul Boltz,
financial economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.
   The Fed isn't likely to launch a major new offensive against
inflation until the pace of business activity gets a good deal
stronger than it has been lately, Boltz says.
   ``Similarly,'' he concludes, ``ease would be called for only if
the economy looks headed for a recession _ something not on the
horizon.''

<HEAD>Environment Overtakes South Africa As Hottest Shareholder
Resolution Item</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds new last graf with Cyanamid comment.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record 300 shareholder resolutions on social
concerns ranging from South African divestment to teen-age smoking
were filed this year for votes at annual meetings, 40 percent more
than last year.
   But the fastest growth came in resolutions urging more corporate
sensitivity to the environment.
   ``People are so fed up with things like garbage barges and Exxon
spills,'' says Rosalyn Will, a researcher at the Council on
Economic Priorities, a New York-based public-interest group that
follows shareholder resolution trends.
   ``Enough is enough,'' she said.
   The growing concern reflects an anxiety over pollution,
atmospheric warming and other signs of global deterioration that
perhaps has been heightened by publicity about the 20th anniversary
of Earth Day on April 22.
   The biggest corporate target appears to be Exxon Corp., the oil
giant that came to symbolize recklessness for many nature-lovers
after the March 1989 oil spill that fouled Valdez, Alaska.
   The company will face eight environment-related resolutions at
its annual meeting April 25, ranging from dismissing chairman
Lawrence Rawl to pledging commitment to the ``Valdez Principles,''
a set of guidelines for corporate behavior devised by a coalition
of environmental groups after the spill.
   ``The average person realizes that large companies can change
what they're doing environmentally,'' Hill said.
   To a lesser extent, shareholder activists say, the environmental
theme of the 1990 annual meeting season just getting under way also
shows that South Africa no longer is drawing the same level of
attention it once did.
   Part of the reason is that many U.S. companies have left South
Africa voluntarily already, and the white-minority government
recently has taken some dramatic steps suggesting it's willing to
give the black majority more power.
   ``The situation is moving there now,'' said Gordon Davidson,
outgoing director of the Social Investment Forum, a national
association of 375 investment funds that promotes what it calls
socially responsible investing.
   ``It's a sign of the work we've done,'' he said. ``It's not that
we're giving up on that issue.''
   South Africa remains the biggest single area of social investor
attention, with about 120 resolutions filed this year, the same as
last year.
   By contrast, 45 environment-related resolutions were filed this
year, vs. six in 1989.
   ``I think a combination of environmental factors is
responsible,'' said Timothy Smith, executive director of the
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York
church-activist group.
   ``Obviously the oil spill galvanized America's attention,'' he
said. ``The concern about global warming, the ozone layer, the rain
forests, reminds us of an international environmental crisis.''
   Other recurring resolutions range from a moratorium on nuclear
weapons to animal-testing bans to a review of business operations
in British-ruled Northern Ireland. But a couple of important new
themes have emerged as well.
   The most notable are resolutions opposing tobacco product
manufacturing and advertising, which are on the agendas of leading
cigarette producers such as Philip Morris Cos., American Brands
Inc. and Loews Corp.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees what
resolutions can be included at annual meetings, reversed an earlier
position that cigarette smoking was not an area in which
shareholders were entitled to vote.
   Infant-formula marketing also has surfaced as a potential battle
issue. Activists have introduced resolutions at Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. and Gerber Products Co. challenging the companies'
practice of advertising formula directly to mothers, claiming it
undermines the practice of breast-feeding.
   Many companies facing shareholder resolutions on political and
social issues fear the adverse publicity such issues create, even
if they have little chance of approval.
   Some have successfully negotiated settlements with the sponsors
that get the measures off the agenda before the annual meetings.
   Amoco Corp., Chevron Corp., Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc. and Waste
Management Co., for example, agreed to provide ``report cards'' on
areas covered by the Valdez principles, and the sponsors agreed to
withdraw their resolutions.
   Fast-food giant McDonald's Corp., facing a resolution sponsored
by church groups challenging its use of styrofoam packaging, agreed
to explore alternatives. The sponsors withdrew their resolution.
   ``They're beginning to see the handwriting on the wall, that the
environmental movement isn't going away next year,'' said Davidson.
``They're trying to figure out how they're going to cope with it.''
   On the other hand, Exxon, Atlantic Richfield Co. and several
other leading industrial corporations declined to make any
concessions on environmental resolutions, so they will come to a
vote.
   Historically, most social resolutions have been defeated easily
by large-scale shareholders who support management's position.But
under SEC corporate governance rules concerning annual meetings, a
resolution needs only 3 percent support the year it's introduced to
remain on the ballot the following year. The next year, it needs 6
percent of the vote, and 10 percent thereafter.
   Of the total resolutions filed this year, a record 250 are
likely to come to a vote, a 43 percent increase over 1989, when 175
of the 214 proposals filed were voted upon, Ms. Will said.
   Some companies have been particularly singled out this year for
what shareholder activists call unacceptable behavior regarding
both South African involvement and the environment.
   On Monday, for example, American Cyanamid Co., a worldwide
pharmaceutical and pesticide producer, faces what organizers call a
massive protest planned for its annual meeting in South Portland,
Maine. Two South Africa divestment resolutions are on the agenda.
   Activists contend the company has been dumping mercury
contaminants in South Africa, mistreating black South African
employees and selling products and services there that strengthen
the apartheid system of racial segregation.
   ``They're on our strategic companies focus list,'' said Diane
Bratcher, a spokeswoman for the Interfaith Center, one of the
protest sponsors. ``What they do is pretty heavy stuff. Toxic
dumping, providing strategic chemicals to the goldmining industry.
That makes Cyanamid a pretty worthy target.''
   Cyanamid issued a statement this past Friday rebutting the
criticism. It said the mercury waste shipped to South Africa is
safely recycled. The company also said it has strictly adhered to
the Sullivan principles of racial equality signed by many American
corporations that still operate in South Africa.

   Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. will sell
or franchise its 40 company-owned Carl's Jr. restaurants in
Arizona, which were losing $5 million a year and contributed to a
73 percent drop in annual earnings.
   The regional fast-food outfit said Thursday it would take a

costs.
   ``We're putting our bets elsewhere,'' said Loren Pannier,
Karcher's chief financial officer. ``We have over $50 million in

   Karcher lost $8.9 million during the fourth quarter ending Jan.
29, compared with net earnings of $4.2 million in the same period
the year earlier. The loss came despite a 6 percent rise in revenue
to $118 million.
   For the year, earnings fell from $20.8 million to $5.6 million.
Sales rose 15 percent from $511.3 million to $445.9 million.

   The dollar was little changed in virtually
motionless trading Friday as most world financial centers closed
early for the Easter weekend.
   Precious metals markets were closed in London, Zurich and New
York.
   Most European markets were closed for a four-day weekend. In
Milan, Belgium and Austria, where trading was conducted, dealers
said activity was practically nonexistent.
   ``It's a good day to read the newspaper,'' said one dealer for a
major foreign bank in Milan.
   Trading in New York also was extremely thin, and most dealers
headed home by midday.
   ``Volume is basically nil,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior trader
at the Bank of Boston. He noted that the only players in the market
were a handful of banks and a few Asian investors.
   Earlier in Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.42 yen to a closing 158.42 yen. In New
York the dollar traded at 158.70 yen, up from 158.18 yen on
Thursday.
   In New York the dollar fininshed at 1.6722 West German marks,
down from 1.6724; 1.4835 Swiss francs, up from 1.4818; 5.6195
French francs, up from 5.6160; 1,230.25 Italian lire, up from
1.229.50, and 1.1645 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1617.
   In New York one British pound cost $1.6368, less expensive than
$1.6420 on Thursday.
   In Milan, the dollar stood at 1,229.50 lire, down from
Thursday's close of 1,231.50 lire. The dollar also sold for 1.6727
West German marks, down from 1.6730 marks in late European trading
on Thursday.

   An investment group trying to buy assets of
the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Co. said Friday it had reached
tentative labor agreements with unions representing railroad
employees.
   Railroad Development Corp. said the agreements cover 80 percent
of the union-represented workforce, including conductors and
workers who handle car repair and inspection, track building and
maintenance. All agreements are subject to approval by the unions.
   The railroad announced Feb. 9 it had agreed in principle to sell
most of its track, rail yards, cars and locomotives to Railroad
Development of Pittsburgh. That same day, the unions sued the
railroad in federal court, challenging the sale, but the action was
dismissed in March.
   The railroad now employs about 525 people, and 150 of them would
be hired initially by Railroad Development. Terms of the
acquisition, which investors hope will be completed by April 26,
were undisclosed.

<HEAD>Hallmark Gets Strong Response to Univision Debt Buyback, Extends
Tender Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. said Friday that holders of
more than 84 percent of the $270 million in junk bonds issued by
its Univision Holdings Inc. unit have accepted terms of a buyback
offer.
   The response reduced the chance that Univision, which operates a
Spanish-language television network and eight TV stations, would
proceed with its threat to file for bankruptcy protection should
the tender offers be unsuccessful.
   Hallmark, a privately-held greeting card company based in Kansas
City, Mo., said ``in light of the latest results'' it was extending
until 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday its tender offers of $131 million in cash
for the two debt issues.
   The company has said that it must get at least 90 percent of the
two issues before it will be obligated to buy any of the securities.
   ``We are hopeful that all bondholders will now tender their
securities and that the Univision restructuring can be completed
promptly,'' Hallmark said.
   Hallmark, which owns 63.5 percent of Univision, offered to buy
the securities at a sharp discount from face value after Univision
was unable to make $10 million in interest payments in February on
its debts to bondholders and bankers.
   Univision was authorized to file for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law if the tender offers
were unsuccessful.
   The offers were to have expired at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
   On Thursday afternoon, a bondholder group which represents
holders of more than three-fourths of the issues said it planned to
accept the tender offers.
   Hallmark originally offered $106 million for the bonds, but
those offers attracted fewer than 10 percent of each issue tendered.
   Hallmark sweetened its offers on March 30 by about 25 percent
and said it had reached an agreement in principle with Univision's
bank lenders.
   Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild Inc., which
is the financial advisor to the bondholders' committee, said his
company considered the offers fair and recommended that a committee
representing the bondholders support them. The committee said it
intended to accept the offer.
   Hallmark is offering 55.3 cents on the dollar for Univision's
$165 million in senior subordinated discount notes and said it had
either been tendered or promised in excess of 90 percent of the
notes under its tender offer.
   It is offering 37.9 cents on the dollar for $105.8 million in
subordinated debentures and said nearly 85 percent of that issue
was either promised or tendered.
   Hallmark has said it plans to defer the interest payments on the
securities purchased in the tender offers for seven years.
   Univision was put together over the past three years as Hallmark
and First Chicago Venture Capital, which owns 21.5 percent of
Univision, bought eight television stations and the Univision

<TEXT>
   It's been more than six months since Ralph
Ingersoll II and his St. Louis Sun swaggered into this Midwestern
city, armed with catchy slogans and ideas about the newspaper
business.
   Ingersoll, chairman and chief executive officer of Ingersoll
Publications Co., named himself editor-in-chief and promised that
the new tabloid would be the first profitable startup of a daily
metropolitan newspaper in 40 years.
   Today, the colorful newspaper's future seems anything but clear.
   The Sun is struggling to overcome higher-than-expected costs,
revolving-door circulation, limited advertising and a murky image
that has turned critics into fans and fans into critics from day to
day.
   ``It seems as if things are not sailing along as smoothly as Mr.
Ingersoll had planned,'' said Charles Klotzer, editor and publisher
of the St. Louis Journalism Review.
   Ingersoll says rumors of the newspaper's imminent demise are
greatly exaggerated.
   On April 1, the newspaper had circulation of 109,000 _ its
highest yet and up from a low of 80,000 during the winter _ thanks
to the start of a new ``Bingo'' promotion, Ingersoll said.
Ingersoll has guaranteed advertisers circulation of 105,000 for the
first six months of 1990.
   And the paper had 181 pages of advertising in the first week of
April _ the Sun's best week since it began Sept. 25.
   ``We have plenty of good news, but we also have some problems
and we need to make some changes,'' Ingersoll said in a telephone
interview Thursday. ``The changes are all evolutionary, not
revolutionary.''
   Ingersoll said that debt problems facing Ingersoll Publications
had cast a shadow over the Sun, although they had no impact on the
newspaper's success or failure because they involved a separate
company owned Ingersoll.
   Last month, Ingersoll announced a plan to buy back some of
Community Newspapers Inc.'s high-interest junk bonds at cut-rate
prices to appease some of his bondholders who were worried about
the company's fiscal health.
   ``We felt we might have a good business opportunity, so we made
the offer,'' Ingersoll said. ``The reaction has been what you would
expect. The bondholders who bought the bonds at a low price are
enthusiastic. The bond holders who bought them at a higher price
are less enthusiastic. And that's where we are.''
   But although the two don't have a direct connection, the
publicity the bonds generated has spilled into the Sun and its
newsroom.
   Richard Stevens, the Sun's metro editor, said editors are
working hard to make sure the newsroom focused on business rather
than rumors and gossip.
   ``Any time that we spend dealing with this kind of stuff is a
negative, but as far as it wasting a lot of our time, it's not a
factor,'' said Stevens.
   It's unclear what the general reaction has been in St. Louis to
the new newspaper.
   Although the Sun has not weighted its local coverage toward
sensational or titillating tabloid-type topics, it still has gotten
complaints from some readers that it sensationalized certain
stories. Drawing criticism, for example, were its coverage of a
politician involved in a sexual assault and of the five-year
anniversary of an accident in which a man nearly was sawed in two.
   The newspaper also has been chided for running photos of new
women's swimsuits and lingerie.
   But the Sun also has been praised for its coverage of the effort
to build a new domed stadium downtown and for its attention to the
troubles facing St. Louis' major air carrier, Trans World Airlines.
   Some critics look down their noses at the Sun's flood of
promotions, fluorescent green billboards and many contests, but Sun
executives defend the practice as the best way to attract new
readers.
   The paper's marketing and editorial aspects are the least of
Ingersoll's troubles.
   The Sun is losing more money than it expected, according to
Ingersoll, mainly because of higher-than-expected circulation costs
and a whopping turnover rate among home subscribers.
   Ingersoll said the company has been forced to spend $5 million
more than planned to distribute the Sun because twice as many
readers as expected wanted their papers delivered.
   ``Advertisers consider that to be very good, but it's much more
expensive than we planned for,'' Ingersoll said.
   Home subscribers also have been canceling their subscriptions at
a high rate, which has left the newspaper with a 300 percent
``churn'' rate. The ``churn'' rate is the rate at which a newspaper
must sign up new subscribers to keep circulation at existing levels.
   For example, if a newspaper has 50,000 home subscribers and it
has to sign up 25,000 new subscribers each year to keep its
home-delivery base at 50,000, the newspaper would have a churn rate
of 50 percent.
   Ingersoll said the paper was researching the cause of its
extremely high churn rate.

   Wholesale prices, helped by a record drop in
vegetable costs and lower gasoline prices, fell in March for the
first time in seven months, the government said Friday.
   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index declined 0.2 percent
last month after no change in February and a huge 1.8 percent gain
in January, the largest in 15 years. Vegetables prices were down by
25.5 percent.
   An unusually severe cold snap in late December, followed by
unseasonably mild temperatures in January and February, caused the
topsy-turvy price pattern. Fuel oil and vegetable costs rocketed in
January. Energy recovered a month later, but food prices didn't
start their decline until March.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said business
inventories fell 0.4 percent in February while sales surged 1.3
percent.
   That report was taken as a sign of economic vigor; rising
inventories can signal a recession.
   Analysts say more good news is ahead.
   ``Energy prices are still coming down and in fact we have a
little more to go in vegetables. April should be a minus sign,''
said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University.
   Excluding the food and energy gyrations, wholesale inflation has
been remarkably stable for nearly two years. Economists look to
these so-called ``core'' prices _ up 0.3 percent in March and 0.4
percent in February _ as a better barometer of underlying
inflationary pressures.
   They foresee little change, at least until next year. The
Federal Reserve Board, they said, is keeping interest rates high
enough to dampen both growth and price pressures but not high
enough to derail the economy into a recession or substantially cut
inflation.
   ``I think this year inflation is going to stay stuck,'' said
economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago.
``Without a recession, you can't bring down inflation quickly.''
   Prices rose 4.8 percent last year. Although the annual rate for
the first three months of 1990 hit 6.7 percent, economists expect
the wholesale inflation rate by the end of the year will come in
close to last year's rate.
   The March wholesale inflation report was better than expected.
Most economists had predicted a slight increase of 0.1 percent or
0.2 percent.
   Food prices dropped 0.6 percent in March, the sharpest decline
since June.
   Vegetables, particularly tomatoes, celery and cabbage, fell 25.5
percent, the biggest drop on record going back to 1967. However,
that marked only a partial recovery from gains of 23.3 percent in
February and 58 percent in January.
   Prices also fell for beef and veal, dairy products and coffee.
They rose for eggs, rice, pasta, pork, chickens, turkeys, fish,
soft drinks and cooking oils.
   Energy prices overall dropped 2.4 percent in March after a
decline of 5 percent in February and an increase of 13.6 percent in
January.
   Gasoline was down 2.8 percent and natural gas declined 2.5
percent. Fuel oil prices went up 10.6 percent, but they had fallen
30.2 percent the month before.
   Clothing prices for men and children rose, while the cost of
women's clothing fell. Passenger car prices, in the face of weak
sales, declined 0.3 percent in March after no change in February
and a 0.7 percent fall in January.
   The various changes put the index for all finished goods, one
stop short of retail, at 117 in March. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 cost $117 last month, up
from $112.10 a year earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also
eased in March. Intermediate goods showed no change, while crude
goods fell 1.4 percent. An example of the three processing stages
would be bread for finished goods, flour for intermediate and wheat
for crude.

<HEAD>Nabisco Brands to Sell Pet Snacks Division</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nabisco Brands plans to sell its pet snacks
division, which makes Milk Bones dog biscuits, to concentrate on
making ``human foods,'' a company official confirmed Friday.
   John Manfredi, a senior vice president of the RJR Nabisco Inc.
subsidiary, said the decision was announced to employees Thursday.
The company had not yet received any offers, he said.
   The pet snacks division employs about 275 people at a plant in
Buffalo and 12 at a kennel in Sherburne, 40 miles southeast of
Syracuse, where its products are tested. Those jobs should not be
in jeopardy, Manfredi said.
   ``Our assumption is that anyone who buys that Milk Bones
business will certainly want to keep it going,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his home in Montville, N.J. ``It's a very
profitable business.''
   The pet snacks division had about $150 million in sales last
year. Its profits were not disclosed separately from Nabisco's,
Manfredi said. The division makes a variety of Milk Bones brand
biscuits, such as ones formulated to curb tartar buildup on dogs'
teeth.
   Nabisco decided to sell the division because it was not a
``strategic fit'' with the rest of its business, he said.
   ``Their business is all in the human foods area,'' he said.
``This is the only one that's not.''
   Since RJR Nabisco was bought out for $24.53 billion by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. last year, the company has sold numerous
assets to reduce debt.
   Among other assets, the company has sold five European food
businesses for $2.5 billion; its Chun King division for $52
million; its Associated Biscuits International Ltd. for $44
million; Del Monte fresh fruit operations for $875 million; and Del
Monte's canned food business for $1.48 billion.
   In a related move Friday, Nabisco said it plans to disband the
12-member sales force of its Nabisco Foods division, headquartered
in Parsippany, N.J., which had included the pet snacks operation.
Manfredi said the company believes sales could be handled more
efficiently by independent brokers than by in-house salesmen.
   The majority of the sales force likely will take jobs with those
brokers, who already handle about 70 percent of the company's
sales, Manfredi said. Others might take jobs elsewhere at RJR, and
few would be left without a job.

<HEAD>Negotiators Fail to Reach Lumber Agreement But New Talks Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade negotiators ended talks Friday without
reaching an agreement on U.S. demands that Japan remove
restrictions on imports of wood products but another round of
discussions is planned.
   Lumber products trade is the only unresolved issue among three
areas in which Washington has been seeking to remove trade barriers
under a section of U.S. trade law known as ``Super 301.''
   ``There are still significant differences in our positions,'' a
U.S. official in Tokyo told reporters.
   ``We have made substantial progress on many points, but some
issues remain to be discussed further,'' said a Japanese Foreign
Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We have
concluded our talks at this round after agreeing to hold another
round of talks in the near future.''
   The U.S. official, who also spoke on condition he not be named,
said U.S. negotiators felt they could reach an agreement before
June 16, when the U.S. administration is legally required to decide
whether or not to take retaliatory action for foreign trade
practices it says are unfair.
   ``I think there is momentum to resolve the negotiations. There
is strong interest in a resolution on both sides,'' the U.S.
official said.
   Last year, the Bush administration designated Japanese trade in
wood products, satellites and supercomputers as areas in which U.S.
products face unfair trade practices under the ``Super 301'' clause.
   The two governments recently reached agreements on greater
access to Japan's satellite and supercomputer markets, but talks on
lumber trade, which began Monday, faced mounting disagreement
mainly because of Japan's complicated housing and construction
regulations, the Japanese official said.
   U.S. industry and government officials say a Japanese law
banning the construction of three-story wooden apartments unfairly
limits wood imports.
   They also say Tokyo's product specifications and tariffs for
lumber unfairly discriminate against imports of high-value finished
and semi-finished wood products. By importing mainly raw timber,
they say, Japan is protecting its own uncompetitive, traditional
timber processing industry.
   Japanese officials, however, argue that such restrictions are
necessary safety precautions in earthquake-prone Japan, and thus
cannot be eased unconditionally.
   While traditional Japanese architecture is based on wooden
construction, modern Japan has strict building codes to minimize
the risk of damage and fire from earthquakes.
   Wooden structures are limited by law to single-family dwellings
up to three stories, and to two-story multiple family housing. Most
apartment buildings in major cities are built of steel and concrete.
   Officials from both sides said they felt technical questions
regarding the safety of wooden housing had been cleared up. They
said progress had been made in all areas of discussion, but
declined to explain remaining disagreements.
   The U.S. official said he expected the talks to resume ``very
soon,'' but did not say exactly when or where the next round of
negotiations would take place.
   Last year, the United States exported $2.8 billion in wood
products to Japan, mostly unfinished logs. Industry officials
estimate that if trade barriers were eliminated, the market would
expand by an additional $2 billion and between 17,000 to 20,000 new
U.S. jobs would be created.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca was the only
Big Three automaker chief executive who got a raise in 1989,
pulling in $4 million, or 8.1 percent more than he collected in
1988, the company's proxy statement said Friday.
   Earnings last year for the nation's No. 3 automaker were down
65.8 percent from the year before.
   Iacocca's compensation in 1989 salary and stock and in bonuses
earned from the year before topped the $2.5 million received by
General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith. It was less, however,
than the $6.6 million awarded to Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E.
Petersen, who retired March 1.
   Earlier this week, after GM and Ford issued their proxy
statements, the United Auto Workers union called the executives'
compensation levels for 1989 a ``disease.''
   The union's offices were closed for the Good Friday holiday.
   Last year's proxy statements showed that Iacocca and Smith
collected $3.7 million each and Petersen got $10.5 million, mostly
in stock.
   Iacocca would have received more for 1989 had the company not
withheld bonuses because of low corporate earnings. The
Chrysler-UAW contract calls on executives to forego cash bonuses in
years when earnings don't reach the threshold for profit-sharing
checks for union-represented workers.
   In 1989, Chrysler earned $359 million, far below the $1.05
billion in profit the company reported for 1988. GM and Ford made
enough money to give their eligible workers profit-sharing checks
of $50 and $1,025 apiece respectively.
   Chrysler's proxy statement said Iacocca's $889,151 salary for
1989 was increased by $525,000 in cash compensation paid last year
from 1988 earnings. The colorful executive also was awarded $2.6
million worth of stock.
   Other top Chrysler executives' compensations contained in the
proxy statement included: Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, $1.1
million; Chrysler Motors Chairman Ben Bidwell, $976,709; Chrysler
Motors President Robert A. Lutz, $951,436; and Executive Vice
President Robert S. Miller Jr., $874,266.
   Although none of the executives will be receiving bonuses based
on 1989 earnings, the board of directors has set aside $22 million
from corporate earnings for compensation later.
   The two issues up for shareholder votes at Chrysler's annual
meeting would change the number of votes each shareholder could
cast in elections for the board of directors and require that each
director hold at east 2,000 shares of Chrysler common or preferred
stock.
   The board opposes both motions.

<HEAD>Record High Cattle Futures Portend Higher Beef Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail beef prices are likely to keep rising at least through
this month because of unusually tight cattle supplies, a situation
already reflected in record high prices for live cattle futures,
analysts say.
   But prices should ease significantly toward the end of May as
cattle placed on feedlots during the winter reach marketable
weights.
   Record-breaking cattle futures prices shared the spotlight with
tumbling crude oil and gasoline futures prices on the nation's
commodity markets in the past week. Elsewhere, precious metal
prices fell and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Live cattle for April delivery rose to 80.40 cents a pound
Wednesday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, surpassing the
previous high of 80.25 cents set in the spring of 1979. On
Thursday, the last trading session before Easter, the contract
climbed to 80.47 cents before settling at 80.42 cents.
   The high futures prices reflect conditions in the cash cattle
market, where meat packers reportedly paid 81 cents to 82 cents a
pound for top-quality cattle in recent days.
   On the retail level, a weekly price survey of 15 cuts of beef in
nine U.S. cities by the Knight-Ridder Financial news service found
an average price of $2.41 per pound Thursday compared with $2.39 a
week earlier and $2.29 a year ago.
   Analysts said the main reason for the rising prices is tight
supplies of market-ready cattle. The situation reflects a decline
in feedlot placements last year after cattle prices fell during the
summer to less than 70 cents a pound, said Thomas Morgan, president
of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   He said cattle typically are marketed within five months of
being placed on feedlots to be fattened.
   Morgan said feedlot placements picked up again last fall and
winter, after dry weather caused poor grazing conditions in the
Southern Plains.
   ``The winter wheat wasn't growing enough to pasture so they
pulled cattle off the pastures and sold them to feedlots in October
through January,'' he said.
   Morgan said those cattle were lighter in weight than the average
feedlot placements, so they are being kept longer before marketing.
   ``They'll start coming mid-May through July,'' he said.
   That should bring cattle prices down, with retail beef prices
likely to follow within a few weeks.
   How far and quickly prices will fall is anyone's guess. The 1979
highs were followed by a collapse of more than 20 cents in less
than three months.
   ``I think people are cognizant of that,'' said Phil Stanley, an
independent futures trader and consultant for DEC Futures Inc. in
Lincoln, Neb.
   ``On any sign of weakness in the cash market you'll probably see
some pretty active selling come into the futures,'' he said.

   Crude oil futures fell dramatically on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after a petroleum industry newsletter reported Monday that
OPEC oil production had reached a nine-year high of 24.1 million
barrels a day in March.
   Selling pressure increased after the American Petroleum
Institute said Tuesday in a weekly report that U.S. stocks of crude
oil had risen by about 8 million barrels, a far bigger weekly
increase than the market had expected.
   Crude oil for May delivery plunged to a 14-month low of $17.28 a
barrel Wednesday morning, rebounded above $18 by the end of that
session, then fell back below $18 by the end of the week.

<HEAD>Financing Plan Extension Granted to Troubled Home Builder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankrupcty judge on Friday extended the
deadline for General Development Corp.'s financing plan and ordered
the troubled real estate giant to honor back paychecks.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge A. Jay Cristol gave General Development
until Monday to present a short-term financial plan. He also
scheduled a series of status hearings through May on the company,
which pleaded guilty last month in connection with a scheme to sell
overpriced homes.
   ``We want to get things moving along,'' said Cristol, who ruled
General Development must pay wages earned prior to the bankruptcy
filing. ``This case will be conducted fully and clearly in the
sunshine.''
   General Development filed for Chapter 11 bankrupcty protection
on April 6, claiming a severe cash shortage after failing to secure
about $60 million in short-term credit.
   Meanwhile, a special master appointed by U.S. District Court
Lenore Nesbitt is reviewing an estimated $100 million restitution
program for about 10,000 victims of the overpricing scheme. The
program is part of a plea agreement that settled a 16-count
indictment against the company and two former executives.
   During the past two months, General Development has cut its work
force and halted most projects at its nine Florida communities.
   The bankruptcy filing does not affect General Development's
time-share and utility subsidiaries, but company officials said the
filing could be expanded.

<HEAD>Wells Rich Greene Agrees to Join French-Led Ad Network</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The advertising agency Wells Rich Greene Inc.
said Friday it will sell a 40 percent stake to a French firm and
join an international ad agency network, in an effort to give its
clients more worldwide services.
   In a separate development, Wells Rich founder Mary Wells
Lawrence said she was stepping aside as chairman and chief
executive and that the agency's board had elected Kenneth Olshan to
succeed her.
   ``Ken and I have been moving toward this day for five years,''
Mrs. Wells said, calling it ``another step in the natural evolution
of the agency.''
   The 60-year-old Mrs. Lawrence has been withdrawing from
day-to-day involvement with the agency over the past three years to
spend more time with her family. She said she also wanted an
orderly succession.
   Olshan, 56, has been with the agency for 15 years and most
recently has been chairman of its Wells Rich Greene Worldwide unit.
   The privately-held Wells Rich Greene handles billings of about
$850 million a year and its clients include International Business
Machines Corp., Ford Motor Co., Procter &amp; Gamble, Hertz and MCI
Communications Corp.
   It has created ads for Alka-Seltzer Plus cold medicine, Benson &amp;
Hedges cigarettes and Pringles potato chips and developed the ``I
Love New York'' theme for the state of New York.
   The agency said it was joining a union of advertising agencies
formed by the French ad agency BDDP over the past six years that
includes agencies throughout Europe and the Far East.
   As part of that agreement, BDDP has agreed to purchase 40
percent of the stock in Wells Rich Greene for an undisclosed amount.
   In turn, Wells Rich's management group will obtain an
unspecified stake in BDDP through stock purchases and exchange of
shares, the firm's statement read.
   Olshan said BDDP executives approached Wells Rich Greene about
joining its agency network several months ago.
   ``BDDP needs a major American agency for their union, just as we
need the right partners in their markets,'' he said.
   He said the association would build the BDDP network into ``the
kind of substantial, talented and realistic resource we want for
our clients.''
   BDDP was founded in 1984 by a group that included the managers
of the ad agencies Young &amp; Rubicam and Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Europe.
   Its clients include BMW, Grand Metropolitan PLC, Polaroid,
Hertz, McDonald's and Electrolux.
   It has developed its ad network by setting up agencies and
buying stakes ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent in others. The
agencies are selected for the creative capabilities and management
of each agency is kept in local hands.
   The BDDP-led network's billings now exceed $1.4 billion.
   In a telephone interview, Mrs. Lawrence said there was no
relation between the two announcements. ``It was all evolving at
the same time,'' she said.
   Wells Rich Greene has offices in five cities _ New York,
Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis and Los Angeles _ but no international
presence other than a stake in an agency in London.
   ``I had been looking for an international solution for quite
awhile now,'' Mrs. Lawrence said.
   But she said the prospective partners either wanted to buy her
whole company, served clients who may have posed a conflict with
clients of Wells Rich Greene or were simply ``not people we wanted
to deal with.''
   The prospective removal of trader barriers within Europe in 1992
made it more important that Wells Rich find an international
partner, though.
   ``The time has come when it would be dangerous not to be fully
represented there,'' Mrs. Lawrence said.
   She said she had been the agency's majority shareholder but
would be selling some of her stock as part of the transaction with
BDDP.
   She declined to say how much she would be left with or how much
she was being paid for her interest nor how large a stake she
planned to buy in BDDP.

<HEAD>Getcha Clean Gasoline, Recyclable Ketchup Bottles and Dolphin-Free
Tuna!</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies call it good corporate citizenship,
skeptics call it greenwashing and some hard-line environmentalists
call it eco-pornography.
   They're talking about the deluge of products, services and
business advertising timed to coincide with celebrations and
publicity marking the 20th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22.
   This past week, for example, Shell Oil Co. announced an
``environmentally enhanced'' gasoline to cut pollution, H.J. Heinz
Co. announced a new effort to turn empty plastic condiment bottles
into carpeting, and the nation's biggest tuna canners promised to
stop buying or selling tuna caught in nets that also snare dolphins.
   Many of these efforts stem from what business executives call a
sincere sensitivity to the environment spawned by growing problems
that range from groaning land fills to acid-rain pollution and
beaches tainted by oil spills.
   Shell's chief executive Frank Richardson, for example, in
explaining the motive for selling a reduced-emission gasoline, said
it ``reflects Shell's ongoing commitment to make environmental
considerations a priority in our development of new products and
processes.''
   Environmental groups generally have welcomed this trend. But as
Earth Day draws closer and more companies seek to exploit its
popularity by touting themselves as environmentalists, some
activists are growing alarmed that the event is turning into a
hype-ridden corporate sales campaign.
   ``We think Earth Day is a good thing. We're also convinced it
has some extremely negative side effects,'' said Peter Dykstra,
spokesman for Washington-based Greenpeace, one of the most visible
and militant environmental groups.
   ``There's a lot of `greenwashing' going on,'' Dykstra said. ``It
is frequently pursued most energetically by the companies with the
worst records. The dolphin problems have been known for a quarter
century. That canners timed their policy change now is certainly
not coincidence.''
   Some industries accused by the environmental movement of the
most serious pollution history, such as lumber-product companies,
have incensed Earth Day celebrants by claiming to be their allies.
   The American Forest Council, for example, a group of timber and
paper companies, has taken out large magazine ads that say ``For
Us, Every Day is Earth Day.''
   ``That goes beyond greenwashing,'' Dykstra said. ``It's
eco-pornography. It exploits environmental concern, just as
pornography is commonly considered offensive and exploitative.''
   Still, the announcements this past week by the nation's three
largest sellers of canned tuna, Heinz's Starkist Seafood Co.'s
subsidiary, Van Camp Seafood Co.'s Chicken of the Sea brand and
Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc., were regarded as a major victory by
environmental activist groups that long have sought to end the
killing of dolphins in giant fishing nets.
   At the same time, the only substantial proof of a policy change
was offered by Starkist. Chicken of the Sea and Bumble Bee, both
owned by foreign companies, by Friday had not disclosed precisely
how they intended to ensure they only will use dolphin-free tuna in
the future.
   ``We do know that Heinz is willing, finally, to go the limit,''
said Brenda Killian, a national organizer for the Save the Dolphin
Project of the Earth Island Institute, a San Francisco-based
environmental group. ``If the others don't, we'll expose them.''
   To some extent, the so-called greening of corporate America is
founded on consumer-based economics. Surveys have shown that a
majority of shoppers will avoid buying a product if they know it
will hurt the environment, and will spend a few more cents for a
product packaged with recyclable materials.
   Marketing Intelligence Service, a research group in Naples,
N.Y., has tracked the introduction of more than 700 products
described as environmentally friendly since 1985, ranging from
biodegradable diapers to ``dioxin free'' coffee filters.
   ``Unfortunately for the consumer and the environment, not all of
these products are as green as they claim,'' the Council on
Economic Priorities, a public-interest group that monitors
corporate behavior, said in its April newsletter. ``Many questions
about green products remain unanswered. Who will distinguish
between true environmental product improvements and false ones? Is
there any agreement about what `safe for the environment' really
means?''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _ Executive pay in Detroit and on Wall Street reflected lower
earnings in the auto and securities industries last year, but
nobody was crying. The chairmen of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. took cuts of between 32 percent and 38
percent in 1989 salary, bonuses and stock options. That still left
Ford's Donald Petersen with $6.6 million, while GM's Roger Smith
and Merrill's William Schreyer took home $2.5 million. Lee Iacocca
even got an 8 percent raise to $4 million despite a 66 percent
plunge in Chrysler Corp.'s earnings. The top three executives at
highly profitable Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. each got a 26 percent raise
to $5.475 million.
   _ Lockheed Corp.'s board won re-election, beating a proxy
challenge from Dallas investor Harold Simmons by a clear margin.
But Simmons claimed a partial victory as four shareholder rights
initiatives were approved, including one requiring the company to
opt out of Delaware's tought anti-takeover statute. Chairman Daniel
Tellep said the board would have to review its ``poison pill''
defenses.
   _ California launched a $28.6 million advertising campaign that
officials hope will persuade three-quarters of the state's smokers
to kick the habit by the year 2000. The drive is funded by a 25
cent-a-pack tax hike authorized last year in a referendum.

   ``We think the papers just didn't check the facts,'' said
McDonald's attorney Joseph Califano. He said the fast food company

   The fat flap began April 4, when industrialist and
anti-cholesterol crusader Phil Sokolof placed ads headlined ``The
Poisoning of America!'' in The New York Times, The Wall Street
Journal and several other papers. The ad asked McDonald's to reduce
the fat in its hamburgers by 10 percent as a ``contribution toward

   A federal bankruptcy judge should appoint an
outsider to take control of Eastern Airlines because management is
``unable or unwilling'' to face market realities, an adviser to the
carrier's unsecured creditors testified Friday.
   Arthur Newman, managing director of investment banking at
Chemical Bank, said he had never seen a company miss its financial
forecasts as frequently or by such large amounts as Eastern has.
   Newman was the first witness at a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court to consider the creditors' request for the appointment of a
special trustee to run the airline, something Eastern's unions have
long sought.
   Present in the packed courtroom were Frank Lorenzo, chairman of
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., and Eastern President Phil Bakes,
who have opposed the idea of relinquishing control of the
financially pressed airline.
   Joel Zweibel, attorney for the committee representing the
unsecured creditors, said they wanted a trustee not to liquidate
Eastern but to sell it as a going concern.
   ``This debtor has lost an extraordinary amount of money since
commencement of the case,'' he told the court.
   Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland expressed impatience with
Eastern, which has been attempting to reorganize since it entered
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings more than a year ago.
   The judge, who repeatedly has postponed proceedings to address
the trustee issue, told the company's attorneys, ``you people have
been squandering the time that's been allotted to ou.''
   At about 7 p.m. Friday, Lifland adjourned the hearing until
Monday morning. Newman, the first of three witnesses the creditors
planned to call, was the only one to testify on Friday.
   In arguing for a trustee, Newman said the airline's management
``was unable or unwilling to face the realities that are there in
the marketplace for Eastern.''
   Eastern plans to call eight witnesses and they are expected to
include Lorenzo and Bakes. It would be the first time Lorenzo has
testifed in court since the carrier filed for bankruptcy.
   Eastern also is asking the judge for permission to withdraw $80
million from an escrow account for to cover second quarter
operations, a request Lifland said he would consider Monday.
   Bruce Zirinsky, one of Eastern's attorneys, said the airline
needs the cash by Monday or Tuesday. After the hearing, though,
Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said Eastern ``has sufficient
resources to keep flying at least through the end of the month.''
   Pressure to appoint a trustee mounted this past week when the
unsecured creditors voted to reject the airline's latest
reorganization proposal and later asked the court to name a trustee
who would sell Eastern.
   ``Eastern's devastating, constantly expanding and unending
losses are extremely damaging to unsecured creditors,'' the
creditors' motion said.
   Before that, the creditors' committee had supported Eastern
throughout its 13-month-long bankruptcy proceeding and had objected
to the unions' calls for the appointment of a trustee.
   The pilots, Machinists and flight attendants unions struck
Eastern on March 4, 1989, forcing the Miami-based airline into
bankruptcy protection five days later. The Machinists union remains
on strike against Eastern.
   The unions long have accused Lorenzo of funneling Eastern assets
to parent Texas Air and sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   A report by court-appointed examiner David I. Shapiro filed in
early March suggested Texas Air had victimized Eastern by
underpaying for the airline and some of its assets by hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   Eastern recently asked Lifland to accelerate approval of a $280
million payment by Texas Air to settle the potential claims raised
by Shapiro's report.
   The trustee issue prompted the collapse last spring of a
proposed buyout of Eastern by the unions and former baseball
commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth.
   Eastern came under additional pressure Monday, when the
committee representing its preferred shareholders proposed a
reorganization plan that would give the airline to the
shareholders, unsecured creditors and new managers.
   It was the first competing proposal to Eastern's own
reorganization plan.
   Eastern owes the unsecured creditors around $980 million, while
the preferred shareholders are due $680 million. The airline's most
recent reorganization plans proposed to pay the two groups only a
fraction of what they are owed.
   Eastern also has about $830 million in unfunded pension
liabilities, according to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a
government agency. Eastern claims its liability is only $376.7
million.

<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MGM-UA Communications Co. said Friday
it lost $9.8 million in the second quarter and revenue fell 27
percent, primarily because it had few movies in release as a result
of trying to sell the company.
   The loss for the quarter ended Feb. 28, the equivalent of 19
cents per share, compared with a loss of $14.7 million, or 29 cents
per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue fell from $241.8 million to $176.8 million, with the
feature films segment declining by 33 percent to $140.8 million.
   Controlling shareholder Kirk Kerkorian had MGM-UA in the auction
block for the better part of two years, nearly drying up the
pipeline for movies.
   Pathe Communications Corp. is trying to complete a buyout of
MGM-UA for $1.27 billion. Analysts say restarting film production
will cost hundreds of millions of dollars extra.
   For the first six months of fiscal 1990, MGM-UA lost $11.9
million, or 23 cents per share, compared with $54.2 million, $1.08
per share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenues fell 6
percent, from $412.2 million to $388.3 million.
   ``Operating revenues decreased during both periods primarily due
to a lack of feature films in theatrical release,'' MGM-UA Chairman
Jeffrey C. Barbakow said.
   ``However, for the first six months of fiscal 1990, the company
posted operating gains due to our successful control of overhead
costs, as well as the continued outstanding sales performances of
the home video and pay television groups.''

   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said Thursday it plans to
sell three small service companies that assist publishers, large
computer users and the oil and gas industry.
   The business information marketer said the planned sales are
part of its previously announced strategy to sharpen the company's
focus on key markets.
   The three businesses, which are being offered for sale
separately, had combined revenue of $200 million last year and were
said to be profitable.
   They are:
   _Neodata Services, based in Boulder, Colo., a leading provider
of subscription-fulfillment services for more than 270 publications.
   _Zytron, based in Menlo Park, Calif., a company that transfers
data generated by large computer users onto microfilm and
microfiche.
   _Petroleum Information, based in Littleton, Colo., which
publishes information on drilling, production and natural gas
transportation for the oil and gas industries.
   The company said the absence of operating income from the three
subsidiaries is expected to be offset by investing and redeploying
the cash proceeds from the sales.
   ``While all these are profitable businesses, we believe that it
is in the best interests of D&amp;B's shareowners to simplify D&amp;B's
business mix and focus our investments and resources on those key
markets in which D&amp;B's participation and leadership positions are
strongest,'' Charles W. Moritz, chairman and chied executive, said.
   He said those markets include risk-management information,
marketing information, directory information and business
applications software.
   Last month, Dun &amp; Bradstreet announced plans to sell Datastream
International and Interactive Data, which provide historical
investment information.

<HEAD>National Intergroup Files Two Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Intergroup Inc. filed two lawsuits
Thursday to try to stop the hostile takeover attempt by the New
York-based Centaur Partners.
   One suit filed with the U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh seeks
an injunction to stop the defendants' efforts to gain control of
the Pittsburgh-based holding company.
   The suits named Centaur Partners, Walker Street Associates and
its affiliates as defendants.
   Centaur said it would vigorously defend itself.
   ``NII's board of directors is desperately trying to intimidate
us and other shareholders,'' it said.
   The federal suit alleged the defendants furnished false and
misleading information to NII shareholders in order to gain control
of their stock.
   ``Defendants' false and misleading consent materials and the
apparent infirmities in their disclosures about their cooperative
efforts have resulted in irreparable harm by creating confusion in
the marketplace and interfering with the free and informed exercise
of the shareholders' franchise,'' NII's court documents said.
   Centaur is seeking to gain seats on National Intergroup's board,
restructure the company and sell off assets. It has claimed it
could receive $29.34 a share by breaking up NII.
   Centaur said its figure of $29.34 a share is based on an
independent analysis conducted by PaineWebber Inc. and is $3 less
than National Intergroup's book value.
   But National Intergroup said in the lawsuit that those figures
are wrong because PaineWebber would earn 10 percent of whatever
profit Centaur may make from breaking up the company.
   The second lawsuit filed in Common Pleas Court of Allegheny
County is seeking a judgment from the court that ultimately would
decrease the percentage of National Intergroup common stock owned
