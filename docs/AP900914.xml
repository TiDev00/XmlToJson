   An Iraqi Airways jetliner landed at
Gatwick airport late Friday with more than 350 evacuees, mostly
American women and children, who told of dwindling opposition by
Kuwaiti resistance fighters.
   Galina Suliman, a passenger from San Francisco, said Kuwaiti
groups were being systematically put down by the Iraqis.
   American Andrea Hanson, who arrived on the U.S.-chartered Boeing
747 with her 5-year-old son Zach, said Kuwaiti resistance groups
did not have enough weapons to fight the Iraqis.
   A British woman on the flight relayed one report of a group of
16 Kuwaitis being gunned down in the street by an Iraqi soldier as
they sat around chatting.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said there
were believed to be 275 Americans on board, 43 Canadians, 26
Britons, six Japanese, six Australians, two West Germans and an
unspecified number of Indians, Syrians and Filipinos.
   However, there was confusion about precise numbers. Press
Association initially reported 39 Canadians were aboard.
   An official at the U.S. Embassy in London said of the Americans
on the fight: ``We haven't got a final head count. We are still
processing.''
   An airport official speaking on condition of anonymity said the
passengers included some men.
   The plane left Baghdad on Friday afternoon and landed at Gatwick
25 miles south of London about 11:30 p.m.
   The airport official said 30 people due to fly to Gatwick had
instead been detained in Baghdad because they could not clear Iraqi
exit formalities in time. She did not give their nationalities.
   Sky News television said the women and children on the plane are
believed to have been among the last who expressed a wish to leave
behind their husbands and fathers in Kuwait.
   The Iraqis have said they are keeping men as hostages to deter
any foreign attack on Iraq.
   The Americans who arrived Friday were booked into hotels in and
around Gatwick for the night. They were due to leave for
Baltimore-Washington International airport on Saturday afternoon.
   The 26-year-old British woman, who declined to gave her name for
fear it might jeopardize her husband left behind in Kuwait, said
the 16 Kuwaitis had been shot on a road near Kuwait City. ``They
were just sitting around chatting. We didn't talk about it too
much. It had a very bad effect (on morale).''
   She added: ``The Iraqis are starting to seal areas. They are
looking for weapons. They are looking for foreigners.''
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and later annexed the tiny,
oil-rich neighbor.
   The British woman said people living in Kuwait were being
restricted in what they could buy but Iraqi soldiers were going
into stores and taking all they wanted. Iraqis were also seizing
jeeps and trucks, she said.
   Ms. Hanson said that in recent days, Iraqi authorities had
succeeded in partly quelling Kuwaiti resistance.
   ``Resistance is very haphazard. The Iraqis are very successful
at putting them down. They haven't got enough people. They haven't
got enough weapons,'' she said.

<HEAD>State Lawmaker's Son Convicted in Bow-and-Arrow Slaying of Mother</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state lawmaker's 20-year-old son was
convicted Friday of intentionally killing his mother with a bow and
arrow as jurors rejected his claim the death was accidental.
   Chad Goetsch, who testified that the hunting arrow slipped when
his mother's voice startled him, showed no emotion when the verdict
was read. He is the adopted son of state Rep. Robert Goetsch, who
testified against him.
   The jury deliberated 4{ hours before finding Goetsch guilty of
first-degree intentional homicide. He was also found guilty of
endangering safety for injuries suffered by his father in a
struggle.
   Circuit Judge Daniel Klossner scheduled sentencing for Oct. 29.
Goetsch faces a mandatory life term for the intentional homicide
conviction.
   The second charge arose from allegations he aimed another arrow
at his father and fought with him after shooting his 51-year-old
mother, Carolyn. The arrow pierced his mother's heart.
   The killing took place after Goetsch arrived at the family home
in Oak Grove early Nov. 8 from his college residence.
   The elder Goetsch had testified that his son had threatened the
mother.
   ``We talked about buying a gun,'' he said. ``She started
insisting on locking the doors. She said she was afraid of him. She
was afraid he was going to kill her.''
   The younger Goetsch testified Thursday that he never meant to
release the arrow, but his mother startled him.
   ``My whole body jerked and contracted and I lost control of the
bow string,'' he said. He denied that he aimed another arrow at his
father.
   Defense attorney Henry Conti said previous family conflicts
described during the trial ``perhaps had an effect in the incident
that morning. I'm afraid it poured over'' to the jury's decision.
   He said the verdict would be appealed.
   The elder Goetsch, who was present when the verdict was read,
said the trial ended as it should, but the outcome brought no
relief.
   ``Justice has triumphed in this case, but I feel bad,
terrible,'' said Goetsch, who adopted Chad at age 4 after marrying
the boy's mother.

   A model of a small NASA ``space taxi'' to
shuttle crew and cargo between Earth and an orbiting station was
unveiled Friday.
   Fifty-five students from two universities designed the mock-up
of the spacecraft that would be launched by a Titan 4 rocket and
would land on a runway similar to space shuttle landings.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has said it
will use the model of the HL-20, which has a 23{-foot wingspan and
is 29{ feet long. Space shuttles are more than four times as long
and three times as wide.
   The nose of the HL-20 resembles space shuttles, with a sleek,
swept-wing tail section.
   The ``space taxi'' is being considered as a means of moving
small loads of cargo and people to and from the planned space
station Freedom.
   It was unveiled on the North Carolina State University campus.
Students from both N.C. State and North Carolina A&amp;T State
University worked on the vehicle.
   ``The agreement with NASA was that we would do the structural
design and construct the working model,'' said N.C. State aerospace
engineering professor Fred DeJarnette. ``They provided the external
shape, the computer geometry of the vehicle.''
   The university is home to the Mars Mission Research Center.
NASA's goal is to reach Mars by 2019 and scientists say a working
space station would be needed to accomplish such a trip.
   To aid in Mars mission research, the center has a budget of $8.4
million from NASA over five years. DeJarnette is the center's
director.

   A golfer reaching for a ball toppled
150 feet off the edge of a cliff and survived with a broken rib and
cuts.
   Bill Sadler, 45, a novice golfer, had not played Pebble Beach
before Thursday, when he took the plunge into sand near the eighth
hole on one of the country's most difficult courses.
   ``I'm extremely lucky. Thursday the 13th wasn't an unlucky day
after all,'' Sadler said Friday from a hospital in nearby Monterey.
   ``The ball was just over the edge of the cliff. I reached down
trying to get it and the ground gave way,'' he said.
   Sadler, a lieutenant commander in the British Royal Navy, has
lived in nearby Pacific Grove for three years. He is an
oceanographer assigned to an annex of the Navel Postgraduate School
in Monterey.
   An Army helicopter airlifted him off the sand and onto the golf
course. He suffered only a broken rib and minor cuts.
   ``He was lucky,'' said sheriff's deputy Ray George. ``This
should have been a coroner's case.''
   Asked if he'd try golf again, Sadler replied, ``Well, we'll see.
I know I'm not doing any more cliff walking.''

   ``Mom, do you remember when you and I used to ... stop at the
park and play on the teeter-totter?'' Sgt. Christopher Austin
writes in his first letter home from Saudi Arabia. ``We used to
balance ourselves on the teeter-totter.''
   His mother, Pam Huffman, has read and reread the words,
scrunched close on sheets from a memo pad. Her sisters, friends and
teen-age daughters all heard excerpts before she tucked the letter
away in a plastic sandwich bag.
   ``It's the most precious thing I've ever received,'' said Mrs.
Huffman, whose only son is in the Army's 82nd Airborne.
   Like thousands of others, Austin is prepared to battle Iraq's
Saddam Hussein. And yet, all he really wants is to come home.
   He's 22, tall, slim and blond. His blue eyes dance when he
smiles, which he does a lot. He loves New Castle, Ind., fresh
laundry, football and Kim, his high school sweetheart and bride of
three months.
   ``I remember when I was in the first grade, Mom, and I used to
walk to school. I saw this bird every morning and it seemed to
follow me all the way, every morning,'' writes Austin.
   ``I remember Uncle Terry and how he used to play his guitar and
sing to me. I remember I used to ride my Big Wheel around the block
and try to jump the humps and cracks in the sidewalk.''
   Memories of home have helped sustain the more than 100,000 U.S.
servicemen and women in Saudia Arabia since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. They make the 120-degree desert days and September
sandstorms easier to bear.
   ``Hello sweetheart,'' writes Army Pfc. Sean Walters to his wife
in Crossville, Tenn. ``It's not all that bad yet. (But) it's hot
and boring ... and the only thing you see are tents for as long as
you can see.''
   Mai Walters, who left Vietnam after Saigon fell in 1975, is
lonely but stoic in her young husband's absence. She waits and
writes to him, then waits some more before finally receiving his
first letters.
   ``Two in one day!'' she yelped after swinging shut her curbside
mailbox.
   ``It's 5 o'clock in the evening here. That would make it 9
o'clock in the morning there. I miss you very much...,'' writes
Walters, a 25-year-old Minnesota native. ``I hate being away from
you, but it's out of my control.''
   Soldiers stationed in the Middle East don't have much, if any,
access to telephones. So they, and relatives back home, revert to
that wonderful old dinosaur: the letter.
   Even if written in chicken scratch on dog-eared paper, through
the mail come bits and pieces of life sometimes lost in telephone
calls. There is time for reflection; time to scribble things in the
margin.
   ``Mike, Tony and I have been spending as much time together as
we can,'' Sgt. Gary Bruce Goodwin assured his mom. He and his two
brothers are also deployed with the Fort Bragg, N.C.-based 82nd
Airborne.
   ``Currently, Mike is suffering from a severe case of diarrhea.
Everybody here is getting it. I had mine last week for five days
and, believe me, it was awful,'' writes Goodwin, 27, the middle
son.
   ``Hello from Saudi Arabia,'' writes Jim Bell, a sober
23-year-old who works in Marine intelligence. ``(It) is really
desolate. Nothing but miles and miles of sand dunes.''
   His father, architect Robert Bell, pauses after reading the
letter again.
   ``I've been thinking over the last few weeks about what my
position is on this,'' said the Oak Park, Ill., father of six. ``My
position is we should get out. I remember the Vietnam thing.''
   His son, who was 8 years old when Saigon fell, is grave about
his commitment to the military. But clearly, too, he is anxious
about the risks of war.
   ``It is difficult to say when I'll get back to the states,''
writes Jim, who'd planned to take accounting courses this fall at
the University of Southern California. ``I wish it were tomorrow
... (but) it looks pretty bleak.''
   Even Army Pfc. Wade Merritt, the Tennessee soldier whose letter
President Bush held up before the nation as an emblem of
patriotism, has his fears.
   ``As much as I love my job, I don't believe in war or the
unnecessary acts of violence against fellow human beings, but it is
my job,'' he wrote in a passage the president did not include in
his televised address.
   ``When I made a decision to make the Army my career, I knew that
this day would come,'' he wrote. ``But I was hoping it wouldn't.''
   ``Yes, I'm a little scared,'' writes Mrs. Huffman's son,
Christopher. ``Check up on Kim for me. I hated leaving her in the
night like that. It was 2 a.m. and she was real shaky, you know?
   ``Just help he out and tell her that I love her, because I
really miss her, Mom.''

<HEAD>Speculator's Violation Earns Him TV Appearance to Educate

<TEXT>
   Convicted felons don't usually appear on
their own television specials.
   But a 56-year-old Tucson real estate speculator had the dubious
distinction, starring in ``Niles Thim: Conditions of Probation.'' A
star, sad to say, was not born.
   ``This is boring,'' one of the investor-victims in the studio
audience complained.
   The judge who ordered the half-hour program said it was intended
to educate and warn viewers ``about the consequences of what a
proper or prudent investment would be.''
   The show, substituting locally for ``New Attitude'' in the ABC
affiliate KGUN's 8:30 p.m. slot Friday, was part of a creative
sentence imposed by Pima County Superior Court Judge Lawrence
Fleischman as a condition of Thim's probation.
   During the Sept. 6 taping, Thim's attorney, Robert Hirsh,
objected frequently to questions that he insisted amounted to ``an
inquisition ... a pillory.''
   Under a negotiated agreement, Thim pleaded guilty in January to
three felony counts of selling unregistered securities. The
securities were mortgages on raw land.
   ``I'm hopeful that people at the very least can be forewarned
about looking before leaping into investments,'' Fleischman said
Friday. ``I think it fulfilled part of the function. I don't think
it was perfect. It's never been done before and we were all
treading on new grounds.''
   Thim also must repay $9.2 million to 112 investors and serve
four years' probation and one year in jail. He has served part of
the term and faces four more jail stays annually during the
Thanksgiving-through-New Year's holiday season.
   Authorities have estimated that more than 600 investors in 18
states lost at least $25 million in real estate investments with
Thim, who failed to register the transactions with the Arizona
Corporation Commission and did not prepare offering memoranda, as
state law required.
   The half-hour program was taped before a studio audience that
included some of the investor victims. It made for
less-than-gripping television; some of the audience walked out
before the end.
   During the taping, Hirsh, Thim, Atchley and Jerry Goddard, a
former county attorney's investigator, sat before the cameras in a
talk-show setting. The agreed-to format limited the questions Thim
could be asked, principally by KGUN anchor Guy Atchley, to dealing
with the three counts to which Thim had pleaded.
   Only one investor, Ina Bartenslager, was allowed to ask a
question on-camera.
   Fleischman and Howard Fell, a Pima County deputy prosecutor who
handled Thim's case, also attended the taping, which was
interrupted frequently by objections from Hirsh to questions
pitched toward Thim.
   ``I thought it was probably worthless from the perspective of
fulfilling any of the real functions of probation,'' Hirsh said.
   He contended that most of the questioning was accusatory,
directed to ``whether Thim was a good guy or a bad guy. I think
they totally missed what I perceived was the whole point of all of
this.''
   Fell was out of town Friday and could not be reached for
comment.
   Hirsh had succeeded through a court appeal in getting Fleischman
to change the name of the show from ``Niles Thim: How I Stole $9.2
Million.'' He objected that Thim didnot steal $9 million and did
not plead to such a charge.
   Mrs. Bartenslager, representing investors who lost money with
Thim, said she and her deceased husband had lost more than $30,000
invested with Thim, proceeds from an automobile accident, and that
she had been forced to put her house up for sale.
   Thim said he sympathized with her but that she had made money
through his investments over the years.
   He also said several times that payments to the investors have
simply been delayed, and that he hopes to repay all within two
years. Thim has filed for bankruptcy and his properties are being
sold off.
   Thim blamed his problems on the savings and loan debacle, which
depreciated Arizona land values, on the 1986 tax changes. He also
said he relied too much on real estate investments and recommended
that investors own their own property.
   Said Fleischman: ``It will be worthwhile if one person who was
about to make an investment stops and thinks. Then it will have
achieved what it was set out to achieve.''

Brigade and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, and other units. They
also include a contingent of 45,000 Marines.
   The American fleet in the gulf and Arabian Sea waters
immediately outside it totals about 30 ships, including three
aircraft carriers, a battleship armed with Tomahawk cruise
missiles, more than a dozen missile cruisers, destroyers, supply
ships and an undisclosed number of submarines. Two hospital ships
are sailing for the gulf. Another seven ships are expected in the
Mediterranean.
   The Pentagon has also sent 22 Stealth fighter-bombers and dozens
of other aircraft.

<TEXT>
   Justo Enrique Dellosa's trip from Kuwait to
Queen Alia Airport took 22 days. Along the road, his fiancee died
of the heat. Then he was one of the faceless thousands stranded in
the Jordan desert.
   ``It was terrible,'' Dellosa said, shaking his head at the
inadequacy of the word but not finding a better one. ``Terrible.''
   He sat on the curb Friday with 50 Filipino friends awaiting an
evacuation flight to Manila. Nearby, a young man hugged his
girlfriend, who wept silently. A group of others joked and laughed.
Chased out of Kuwait by hunger and fear after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion, they did not know what to expect back home.
   Dellosa said his friends had gone to the gulf for work they
could not find in the Philippines. Nearly a million foreigners -
many of them citizens of impoverished Asian countries - had come
for the same reason. Hundreds of thousands have begun tortuous
trips home in the last six weeks.
   ``I'll find something, maybe,'' Dellosa said, looking dubious.
His last possessions were within reach, stuffed into a cheap
suitcase. His pockets held a few dollars worth of Iraqi dinars.
   As an office boy in Kuwait, he earned $450 a month. For four
years, he fed a bank account to pay for a trip to the United States
for a shot at the American dream.
   ``I have an auntie and two uncles in California,'' he said.
``Also, an auntie in New Mexico. You know where that is?''
   But Iraqi authorities froze all Kuait bank accounts. They
searched Dellosa at the border and shook him down for a few
electronics items he might have sold for a small stake.
   Dellosa's parents live in Manila, but with four daughters and
three other sons, they have scant means to provide for a destitute
27-year-old son.
   The Filipinos' plight was shared by the 12,000 to 15,000 Asians
who mob the airport each day to get onto the dozens of special
flights home. On Friday, ragged lines of Indians, Bangladeshis and
Sri Lankans snaked out of Terminal 2. Each slight movement touched
off a mad scramble among people terrified of being left behind.
   Dellosa and his financee, Thelma Cajayon, left Kuwait early Aug.
23 in a taxi with two others. The driver left off the air
conditioning, afraid of overheating the car in the blasting sun.
   After 11 hours on the road, only 60 miles from Baghdad, Thelma
collapsed from the heat. Revived, she went into convulsions from
nervous anxiety.
   ``We got her to a doctor, but it was a small provincial
hospital,'' Dellosa said. ``They could not do anything.''
   After her death, he pressed on with his friends. A day later,
they crossed out of Iraq. Besieged by refugees, Jordanian
authorities held the newcomers in a no man's land without admitting
them to Jordan. Fate landed Dellosa in Shaalan II, a tent camp with
water tanks and a clinic. It was a luxury next to the filthy
squalor of Shaalan I, where refugees with no shelter battled for
food and water.
   But the same heat and dust beat down on both camps, with
bone-chilling cold at night. Refugees tried to sleep on sharp rocks
infested by scorpions and snakes. Day and night, they were
tormented with fear and confusion. None knew when their consulates
might find enough airplanes to get them home.
   For 22 days, Dellosa and his friends paced in the sun and tried
to keep up their health.
   ``We ate sardines, some tomatoes, Arabic bread,'' he said. ``At
the end, they gave us only some kind of corned beef with hair from
the cow still in it.''
   Eventually, buses took the refugees to another camp outside of
Amman. From there, three days later, they were at the airport.
   Prodded by questions, Dellosa reflected on his ordeal.
   ``I suppose I am happy to be going,'' he said. ``But I left my
girlfriend behind. And my whole life in Kuwait. They destroyed our
futures. All of our dreams, they are nightmares.''

<HEAD>As Berlin Wall Goes Down, Rabies Goes Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The snarling guard dogs that patrolled the
Berlin Wall held back East Germans yearning to breathe free in the
West, but they also kept an unwelcome visitor at bay - the rabid
fox.
   When the wall came down, dozens of the disease-ridden creatures
began scampering into West Berlin, reintroducing a dreaded ailment
that had been virtual eradicated.
   Since the wall crumbled last November, 37 rabid foxes have been
found in West Berlin, including one at a crowded swimming pool.
About 10 people have been bitten, according to West Berlin health
department spokesman Thomas-Peter Gallon.
   ``The fall of the borders with East Germany not only led to
people moving freely, but also foxes,'' Gallon said. ``Before,
rabies had been virtually wiped out.''
   Surrounding East Germany has been slow in combating rabies,
health officials said, although no statistics on rabies cases in
the east were available.
   West Berliners have been thrown into a minor panic by the rabies
outbreak. Police have even issued warnings over radio and by
loudspeakers from a van.
   Doctors have cautioned against alarm but warn bite victims to
seek shots to stop the disease, which can be fatal if untreated.
   The savage guard dogs once posted along border crossings scared
away foxes as well as people, said Gallon. In the case of the
foxes, just the scent of the dogs was enough to keep them way.
   When the wall and other border barriers came down, the dogs were
retired and the foxes found they could dash over the crumbling wall
and into the West.
   In addition to the 37 rabid foxes, West Berlin officials have
found six other rabid animals since Nov. 9.
   During the preceding 10 months, there were only three rabid
animals found in West Berlin, none of them foxes. No one was
bitten, Gallon said.
   He estimated it could take up to a year to bring rabies back
under control, adding the real fear is that it could spread to dogs
and cats.
   West Berlin officials have issued a public appeal for pet owners
to be sure their beloved dogs and cats are immunized. Local
veterinarians have offered special prices to help with the program.
   ``Rabies Getting Worse!'' screamed the headline of the daily
Berliner Morgenpost on Friday. ``Now a Dog is the Victim of the
Disease.''
   The newspaper said the dog, presumably bitten by a rabid fox,
had become the first pet with the disease in West Berlin in five
years. Another recent article said a 70-year-woman was attacked by
a fox in a city park.
   ``With the Berlin Wall opening, it really went up,'' said Dr.
Christian Schoenfeld, a leading immunologist involved in rabies
treatment. ``The wall was definitely a barrier.''
   Gallon calls the rabies outbreak ``one of the small, unavoidable
disadvantages'' of the wall's opening. West Berlin officials are
already working with the East Germans to curb the threat, he said.
   West Germany, like many Western countries, has had great success
over the years by using bait laden with an immunizing substance to
eliminate the rabies virus in the wild animal population.
   Schoenfeld, who at one point interrupted an interview to answer
a co-worker's anxious query about rabies, cautioned against
overreaction. He noted that anti-rabies injections are given in the
arm now, rather than the painful stomach injections administered in
the past.

   The violence claiming scores
of lives every week in South Africa threatens efforts to end
apartheid and is pushing the country into what some fear will be
civil war.
   Optimism generated earlier this year by President F.W. de
Klerk's steps to end white rule is fading. Rival black factions are
feuding for power, white extremists vow to fight any effort to end
apartheid, and the violence is creating mistrust on all sides.
   Growing numbers of whites and blacks fear the country is
hurtling out of control. White and black leaders warn they won't be
able to end apartheid if there is no peace or trust between ethnic
groups.
   De Klerk warned Friday that growing violence was undermining the
government's efforts to share power between whites and blacks and
find a way for the two groups live together peacefully.
   ``The new South Africa, which is the goal of all sincere South
Africans, is being threatened by present events,'' he said.
   Chris Hani, leader of the African National Congress' military
wing, said South Africa is already in a state of ``undeclared
war.''
   Almost 800 people have been killed since August in the black
townships that ring Johannesburg. People have been butchered on
trains, burned to death in their homes and hacked to death in the
streets.
   ``More than everything in my life I want this fighting to stop.
I haven't slept for days - every night I hear gunfire and shouting
and whistles. Sometimes I get messages that they are coming,'' said
Boxer Ngwenga, a township resident.
   Despite calls from white and black leaders for peace, the
violence shows no sign of ending. The reasons for the fighting are
numerous and complex.
   Much of the fighting pits Zulus aligned to the conservative
Inkatha party against Xhosas and other blacks linked to the ANC.
   Rivalry between Inkatha and the ANC has cost more than 5,000
lives in Natal Province in recent years, and the power struggle has
intensified and broadened with the government promise to end white
rule, political analysts say.
   The ANC and Inkatha disagree over plans for a future South
Africa, with the nationalistic Zulu group favoring conservative
policies, including a capitalist economy. The non-tribal ANC talks
about compulsory redistribution of wealth and left-leaning programs
to end poverty.
   But the violence in the townships has become increasingly
chaotic, with armed men attacking strangers for no discernible
reason. Fear appears to be fueling the violence, prompting people
to kill before they are killed.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has repeatedly offered to
meet Nelson Mandela, the ANC's deputy chief, to negotiate an end to
the violence. The ANC has refused, accusing Buthelezi of using the
fighting to get a meeting with Mandela and enhance his stature as a
national leader.
   In any case, the ANC and Inkatha acknowledge they have many
young followers they cannot control, and it's unclear whether a
meeting would stop the fighting.
   The ANC contends the police are provoking the violence in an
attempt to wreck peace talks and preserve apartheid. Townships are
filled with stories of mysterious white men leading attacks.
   The government and the police have denied the charges. But many
analysts believe some of the violence is organized, possibly by
rogue elements in the security services determined to preserve
white rule at any price.
   White extremists fear the end of apartheid would mean their
destruction. Whites, they claim, would be submerged by the black
masses and violence and anarchy would sweep the country.
   The violence so far has had little impact on white South
Africans. It has been confined to black townships and the only
white casualties have been a few police officers.
   Government officials and others worry about what could happen if
whites are dragged into the fighting. Most whites have guns and
even a minor incident could spark a confrontation with blacks.
   Chances of peace seem to be getting slimmer as the violence
spreads. How, political leaders ask privately, can people at each
other's throats hope to live in peace and racial equality?

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One week before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
the State Department refused to allow the Voice of America to
broadcast an editorial critical of President Saddam Hussein's
threats. The department cited concerns that the editorial would
anger Saddam, sources say.
   The case is the latest indication that some administration
officials and congressional leaders either misread Saddam's
intentions in the months preceding the invasion or believed he
could be talked out of them.
   A week before the Aug. 2 invasion, U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie
was quoted as telling Saddam that the United States understood his
need for money to rebuild Iraq after its eight-year war with Iran.
   ``We understand that, and our opinion is you should have the
opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the
Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait,''
Ms. Glaspie is quoted as telling Saddam.
   Her comments were echoed in subsequent days by officials in
Washington.
   Three months earlier, four Senate leaders met with Saddam and
assured him the United States wanted to improve relations with his
country. In response to questioning by the group, led by Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Saddam acknowledged he had
chemical weapons and was working on a nuclear bomb.
   Dole assured Saddam that President Bush would reject attempts in
Congress to impose sanctions on Iraq, and might even veto them,
according to a transcript of the meeting, which was taped by Iraq
without the senators' knowledge.
   ``The meeting was supposed to be private. We were prevented from
taping it but the room was bugged,'' said Dole's spokesman, Walt
Riker, who attended the April 12 meeting.
   Riker said the Iraqi transcript was doctored to excise comments
by Saddam that agreed with U.S. positions.
   Iraq also provided a transcript of the meeting with Ambassador
Glaspie. The State Department declined to say whether it accurately
reflected her remarks.
   Analysts say Iraq has circulated the transcripts in an attempt
to show that Saddam did not have any indication the United States
would object so strongly to his invasion of Kuwait.
   Dole rejected Saddam's claim that the administration was leading
a campaign against Iraq. On the contrary, Dole said, a VOA
commentator who had written a critical editorial about Saddam two
months earlier was fired.
   In fact, the commentator was not fired. Riker said Friday that
Dole had been misinformed by the State Department.
   Sources say VOA was sharply reprimanded for the Feb. 15
editorial, which said democracy requires the dismantling of secret
police services in such countries as North Korea, Iran, Libya, Cuba
and Iraq.
   The sources also say the same editorialialist wrote the July 25
editorial the State Department refused to clear.
   All VOA editorials have to be cleared by the radio's parent
agency, the U.S. Information Agency, and, in the case of sensitive
topics, by the State Department.
   ``We were asked to refrain from muddying the waters as long as
diplomatic efforts were underway in the Arab world to resolve the
crisis,'' said a State Department official of the decision to stop
the editorial.
   In the days before the invasion, Egypt, Jordan and other Arab
countries were trying through diplomacy to prevent Saddam from
fulfilling his threats.
   ``This is all Monday-morning quarterbacking,'' Riker said of
those who say the United States should have known better than to
try and pacify Saddam.
   He said the Senate group went to Iraq in an attempt to find out
Saddam's intentions and to warn him that he would have to improve
his behavior if he wanted better ties with Washington.
   But the Iraqi transcript of the meeting paints a somewhat
different picture.
   ``After listening to you for about an hour, I realize you are a
strong and an intelligent man and that you want peace,'' Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, is quoted as saying.
   And Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyoming, told Saddam his problem was
with the Western media, not with the U.S. government. ``The press
is spoiled and conceited,'' he is quoted as saying. ``My advice is
that you allow these bastards to come here and see things for
themselves.''
   Simpson's spokesman, Stan Cannon, said the senator was a
well-known advocate of press freedom and that his comments were
taken out of context.
   ``Saddam is just trying to embarrass him,'' Cannon said.

   Three senior members of a
white-supremacist group have been convicted of more than 100
offenses committed in an 18-month terrorism campaign against
Asians.
   A Perth District Court jury on Friday found the men guilty of
conspiring to drive Asians out of Western Australia state with a
series of tactics, including arson attacks on Perth Chinese
restaurants.
   They also carried out a string of thefts to fund the movement,
which reportedly has offshoots in other states.
   Two defendants argued they were patriotic Australians fighting
for their country.
   A former member of the group who had testified against the
defendants received plastic surgery and was given a new identity
overseas.
   Judge Kevin Hammond planned sentencing hearings on separate days
next week.

   The United States is relying on U.N.
diplomatic backing in the Persian Gulf but ignoring the world
body's military potential.
   Instead, U.S. officials are trying to resurrect a Middle East
military alliance.
   Washington wants Moscow to help blunt Iraqi aggression.
Ironically, the earlier Middle East alliance was the 1955 Baghdad
Pact, later called CENTO, in which America allied with Iraq against
the Soviet Union.
   CENTO unraveled in 1959 when Iraq dropped out after
revolutionaries overthrew the country's monarchy.
   In his effort to forge a new alliance, President Bush has urged
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to send ships or troops to join
the U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf.
   But Gorbachev has refused. The Soviets say they will only send
troops as part of a U.N. command under the direction of the
Security Council's Military Staff Committee. That committee
consists of officers from the United States, Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China - the five permanent council members.
   The Military Staff Committee has never been activated to
coordinate or monitor any U.N. military operation, however. Even
the Korean War U.N. command was primarily under U.S. control, with
some allied troops pitching in.
   On Sept. 4, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Congress
the United States needs ``a new regional security structure'' in
the Middle East to deter Iraqi aggression the way NATO checked the
Soviets in Europe.
   Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates
are the likely partners in the alliance, which has yet to take
shape.
   In the process, Baker bypassed the United Nations. The world
body already has more than 10,000 military observers and
peacekeepers in various global hot spots, though the United States
and Soviet Union have not contributed troops to those forces.
   Why has Washington ignored the U.N.'s military potential?
   An official at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Thursday that activating the
Military Staff Committee is being explored, but it will be ``a very
long and slow process.''
   The U.N. ambassadors of the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain, France, and China held two private meetings with top
military officers from their countries, flown in from Washington
for the talks.
   The U.S. Mission official said the Military Staff Committee
could begin receiving reports on the naval enforcement of the
U.N.-ordered embargo on Iraq from the United States and other
nations involved.
   ``This skeletal structure can now begin to grow,'' he said.
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said he has no objection ``in
principle'' to U.S. participation in an international military
operation. However, Cheney said he could not imagine breaking the
``constitutional chain of command'' that leads up to Bush as
commander-in-chief.
   ``The Pentagon, of course, would object vehemently to the notion
of putting U.S. personnel under international authority,'' Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., said Sept. 7 at a gulf policy seminar.
   Aspin, however, said Bush should consider the idea of a U.N.
command structure.
   Ed Luck, president of the U.N. Association of the U.S.A., said,
``One could easily meld the idea of a regional security system with
the U.N. Charter and with the Military Staff Committee.''
   His group is a private organization that studies U.S. policy
toward the world body. It generally advocates more active American
involvement in the United Nations.
   With more U.N. peacekeeping operations looming in the Western
Sahara in Africa and Cambodia, it is time to revive the U.N.
committee as a coordinating group, Luck added.

   The U.N. Security Council overwhelmingly
voted late Thursday to allow food shipments to Iraq and occupied
Kuwait only ``to relieve human suffering'' and said relief agencies
must distribute the aid.
   The wording of the resolution, which passed 13-2, sought to
maintain the narrow restrictions under which aid could be sent, in
line with a resolution passed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The council rejected an alternative Cuban-sponsored resolution
that would have opened the door to unlimited food shipments to the
estimated 19 million people in Iraq and Kuwait, including hundreds
of thousands of foreigners trapped by the invasion.
   Cuba and Yemen voted against the resolution.
   The United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France, Finland and
Canada sponsored the resolution. Also voting in favor were China,
Colombia, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania and Zaire.
   Under Security Council Resolution 661, passed four days after
Iraq's invasion, only medical supplies may be sent to Iraq or
Kuwait, or, ``in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs.''
   India and the Philippines, however, have appealed to the
Security Council's sanctions committee for permission to send food
to their people still stranded in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraq has said it will not feed the 140,000 Indians, 93,000 Sri
Lankans and 60,000 Filipinos it holds, but that they must rely on
their governments.
   The resolution passed Thursday said the International Committee
of the Red Cross or ``other appropriate humanitarian agencies''
should distribute the food or supervise its distribution.
   That left open the possibility that the Iraqi Red Crescent, one
of the Moslem national charities that are members of the ICRC,
might be allowed to handle food distribution.
   The five permanent Security Council members had said earlier
Thursday that food shipments should be allowed into Iraq and
occupied Kuwait ``to relieve human suffering.'' The permanent
council members are the United States, Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China.
   Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Al-Anbari said Wednesday that only
``Iraqi authorities'' could distribute food in his country.
   The full 15-member council was ready to adopt it Thursday night
when the ambassador from Yemen, the only Arab nation on the
council, suddenly left the closed-door meeting.
   Cuba and Yemen had been pushing a separate resolution with a
very board definition of humanitarian circumstances that would have
allowed unlimited shipments of basic foodstuffs to feed the Iraqi
civilian population.
   If the Security Council's committee on sanctions decides ``there
is an urgent humanitarian need to supply foodstuffs to Iraq or
Kuwait in order to relieve human suffering,'' it can recommend the
council allow such aid to be sent, the resolution said.
   Al-Anbari also has rejected the idea of U.N. experts
investigating the food situation in his country.
   Also Thursday night, the council's committee on sanctions was
expected to approve India's request to send a ship loaded with 22
million pounds of food to Kuwait to feed 140,000 Indians stranded
in that country and Iraq.
   In addition to Finland, the other members of the council are
Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Nepal,
Senegal and Yugoslavia.

   Sharon Pratt Dixon is a political unknown, but
the woman who is favored to become the next mayor of the nation's
capital is hardly a political novice.
   The probable successor to Marion Barry, Dixon scored a stunning
victory Tuesday in the city's Democratic primary, her first bid for
public office.
   ``She didn't have the kind of money in the primary to put out
those television commercials, `This is Sharon Pratt Dixon, and this
is who I am,''' said Julius Hobson, a longtime observer of city
politics.
   ``But it would be a mistake to call her a political newcomer -
she doesn't have a real day-to-day record, but she does have a long
involvement in local and national politics,'' said Hobson.
   She was short on cash, staff and supplies, but Dixon's theme
throughout the primary campaign was that the time had come to get
rid of the bloated bureaucracy and inefficiency associated with
Barry's administration.
   While her message had become familiar on Election Day, voters in
this city of 620,000 still know little about the 46-year-old
divorced mother of two - or the depth of her political experience.
   A former treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, Dixon
learned how to run a city-wide campaign when she managed former
Carter aide Patricia Roberts Harris' unsuccessful effort to defeat
Barry in the district's 1982 primary.
   And when she made her victory speech Tuesday, DNC Chairman Ron
Brown chose to stand by her side.
   Dixon is also an old friend of Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, who
fashioned his own underdog campaign last year in becoming the Old
Dominion's first black governor.
   If elected in November, she would break new ground herself,
becoming the first black woman to serve as mayor of a major
American city.
   She's no stranger to Congress, which reviews the annual city
budget and frequently takes a more critical look when things aren't
going well for the local government. Within hours of her victory,
she had set up a meeting with Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The city's image on Capitol Hill, badly tarnished by Barry's
drug conviction and the local government's $93 million deficit,
already seems to be regaining some of its luster.
   ``I'm a very optimistic person and a very determined person,''
Dixon said wen asked to describe herself. ``I don't take no for an
answer very easily.''
   Those who know the slight, bespectacled woman agree.
   ``She's always been a very aggressive person, eager to prove
herself,'' said her aunt, Aimee Pratt. ``I remember when she was a
little girl and she would be climbing on a chair or something. I
would tell her not to, and she would say, `But I can, I can!'''
   Her business resume is lengthy, too. An attorney, she rose
through the ranks at the Potomac Electric Power Co. to become
director of the utility's consumer affairs department before
launching her long-shot mayoral campaign.
   ``She's a very warm, dynamic, intelligent person,'' said W. Reid
Thompson, Pepco board chairman. ``She is very relaxed with people,
and she shows a lot of poise and charm.''
   ``She's really succeeded in the mainstream of politics, and in
the business world,'' said Eddie Williams, director of the Joint
Center for Political Studies, a black-oriented think tank. ``She's
a technician, very good with numbers. Her background is more ...
corporate than civil rights.''
   Dixon has taught at the University of the District of Columbia's
law school; worked on a commission that took authority over the
city's criminal code from Congress and gave it to the city council;
and served in a variety of legal posts at Pepco.
   And while voters responded to Dixon's repeated, sometimes
strident calls for cuts in the city work force and elimination of
other forms of cronyism, those familiar with her believe there is
another side to her.
   ``Something people don't see is that she is very gentle, not
aloof at all,'' her aunt said. ``You have to get to know her, but
once you do, she's very approachable and warm.''
   It wasn't until after Barry was convicted of a cocaine
possession charge - less than a month before the primary - that
city residents started paying attention to Dixon. She scored a
major coup two weeks later, when The Washington Post endorsed her
over four rivals with longtime ties to city government.
   Democrats outnumber Republicans here by a 9-to-1 margin, so
Dixon appears headed for victory Nov. 6 against GOP candidate
Maurice Turner, a former city police chief.

<HEAD>U.S. Agreeable to Phaseout of U.S. Bases, Congressman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. negotiators in the Philippines are likely
to propose a 10-year phaseout of U.S. bases with a possible
commercial agreement for limited use of the facilities afterward, a
congressman said late Thursday.
   If the position is taken, it will be the first time the U.S.
government has been willing to discuss a withdrawal from Clark Air
Base and Subic Navy Base, two of its largest overseas facilities.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said he has talked with
administration officials involved in the talks to open next week in
Manila.
   The Washington Post, citing congressional and administration
sources, reported in its Friday editions that the United States was
considering the phaseout.
   State Department spokesman Martin Judge said he could not
comment on the Post report or comments by Solarz, D-N.Y.
   Richard Armitage, head of the U.S. negotiating team, was en
route to Manila.
   The U.S. government has given no details of exactly where or
when the talks will be taking place in Manila, citing security
concerns. A series of bombings blamed on either right- or left-wing
rebel opponents of President Corazon Aquino have shaken the city in
recent weeks, and there have been threats against Americans.
   The agreement under which the bases are used by U.S. armed
forces expires next year.
   Solarz, in a telephone interview, said he has had discussions
with U.S. negotiators about the possibility of a 10-year phaseout
and other positions the team might take.
   ``I have the impression that this is a timetable they are
comfortable with and likely to propose,'' Solarz said.
   The congressman, who is well known in the Philippines for his
interest in the country, said the position recognizes the fact that
``we cannot persuade the Filipinos to let us stay indefinitely but
could conceivable persuade them to allow use of the bases for
another decade.''
   He said the idea would be that if U.S. and Philippine
authorities feel a U.S. military presence is needed beyond that,
the U.S. government could have access to the bases, which already
are technically owned by the Philippines, on a commercial basis,
paying for their use.
   Current agreements call for unlimited U.S. use of the facilities
based on an aid package that Congress has trimmed below levels
agreed upon between the two countries' negotiators.

   Iraq warned Thursday of possible terrorist attacks against U.S.
forces, sounding the theme of Arab feelings wounded by the presence
of non-Moslem soldiers massed in the holy lands of Saudi Arabia.
   But a convocation of Moslem clergy in Mecca, Saudi Arabia,
condemned the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait and said the U.S.-led
multinational force's presence was justified by Iraq's invasion.
   Late Thursday, the U.N. Security Council voted 13-2 to allow
food shipments to Iraq and occupied Kuwait only ``to relieve human
suffering'' and said relief agencies must distribute the aid.
   Cuba and Yemen, the only Arab nation on the council, voted
against the resolution, which was sponsored by the United States,
the Soviet Union and four other countries.
   Meanwhile in Tokyo, the Japanese government announced Friday
that it will provide an additional $3 billion in aid to more than
$1 billion already promised to assist peacekeeping forces in the
Persian Gulf region and nations suffering from the U.N.-sponsored
embargo against Iraq.
   Members of the U.S. Congress had complained Japan was not doing
more in the crisis, and had not contributed enough in light of its
high dependence on Middle East oil. Iraq and Kuwait possess 20
percent of the world's oil reserves, second only to Saudi Arabia.
   Chief government spokesman Misoji Sakamoto said Japan's
increased contribution was not in response to U.S. demands but was
his country's ``contribution to the world based on the United
Nations resolutions. ... We are not only listening to what the
United States says.''
   Sakamoto said the expanded contribution was the maximum Japan
could provide at this point.
   In another development, the U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia said
the flow of equipment for American forces into Saudi Arabia was
eight days behind schedule. The commander, though, said the troops
and military hardware already there were sufficient enough to stop
any Iraqi attack.
   Iraq's warning came in a memorandum to the U.S. charge
d'affaires in Baghdad, according to the Iraqi News Agency,
monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus. It said Iraq was responding to a U.S.
claim that Iraq-based terrorists were preparing to attack U.S.
targets.
   The United States is creating a ``pretext'' for aggression, the
memorandum was quoted as saying, and ``Iraq reserves its legitimate
right to self-defense, to reciprocate and to retaliate firmly
against these parties if it becomes a target.''
   ``President Bush should expect that the crimes the United States
of America is committing against the Arab nation and the insult it
is directing to the Islamic shrines by occupying holy lands will
undoubtedly produce a natural reaction from the Arab and Islamic
masses,'' said the memorandum.
   INA said the U.S. claims were contained in a note delivered
Wednesday to the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad.
   In Washington, State Department officials said U.S. diplomats in
Baghdad told Iraqi authorities Wednesday night that the United
States would hold them accountable for any terrorist attacks on
Americans.
   A U.S. official said American intelligence has indications
terrorist groups based in Iraq have begun planning for possible
actions against various targets - not only American, but also of
allied Arab countries.
   All U.S. intelligence gathering posts are ``on a high state of
alert,'' the official said. All the U.S. officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In the past, U.S. officials have noted that two Palestinian
leaders linked to terrorist acts - George Habash and Mohammed Abbas
- have their headquarters in Baghdad.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III flew to Damascus on
Thursday to try to reinforce U.S. cooperation with Syria against
Iraq, its longtime enemy.
   Meanwhile, more than 300 Moslem religious scholars and preachers
from the Saudi-funded Moslem World League issued a declaration
after a meeting that ended Wednesday. They condemned Saddam's
annexation of Kuweit as ``un-Islamic.''
   The ``Mecca Declaration'' said the invasion of Kuwait and the
massing of Iraqi troops on Saudi borders ``are enough Islamic
reason'' to justify the presence of non-Moslem forces for Saudi
Arabia's defense.
   ``Moslems should not attack or commit any felonies against each
other,'' the declaration said. ``Within these rulings, Iraq's
invasion and occupation of Kuwait is against the principles of
Islam.''
   Saddam last month attacked the Saudi monarchs for inviting in
the Americans, saying their presence sullied the holy sites of
Mecca and Medina. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader,
echoed Saddam's statement on Wednesday in a further sign Iran and
Iraq may be entering an alliance of convenience following their
eight-year war, which ended in 1988.
   Oil experts said Thursday that Iran's reported food-for-oil deal
with Iraq could allow Tehran to earn nearly $2 billion more a year
by eliminating its other oil imports and boosting exports. Sources
have said Iran agreed to send food and medicine to Baghdad in
exchange for 200,000 barrels of oil per day.
   Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based newsletter
Petrostrategies, said Iran ``probably could supply enough food to
the right people and places to keep the Iraqi economy going'' for
awhile.
   Iran's oil refineries were damaged during the war, so the
Iranians have been importing 150,000 barrels a day, paid for in
scarce foreign currency.
   Kayhan International, a Tehran newspaper, said Thursday that
recently improved ties would allow the two countries to ``safeguard
the area's tranquility, and also prevent the influence and
domination of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf.''
   The Tehran Times, which reflects government thinking, on
Wednesday denied Tehran had agreed to provide food and medicine to
Iran. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United
States believes Iran will uphold the U.N.-imposed embargo of Iraq.
   Ambassador Marjatta Rasi of Finland, head of the U.N. Security
Council sanctions committee, said Iraq already was feeling the
pinch from the trade embargo. She said Iraq had ``plenty of
foodstuffs'' stockpiled but was withholding food from foreigners.
   The U.N. Security Council vote sought to maintain the narrow
circumstances under which aid could be sent, in line with a
resolution passed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. But Cuba,
Yemen and some non-aligned nations insist food should be allowed in
under much broader circumstances.
   Differences also have surfaced between the United States and its
allies over how to pay for the troop deployments in the region and
related costs - such as feeding refugees and reimbursing countries
whose economies suffer as a result of the embargo of Iraq.
   Earlier Thursday, Japan's government rejected plans by the U.S.
House of Representatives to link support for U.S. troops in Japan
to Tokyo's contribution to the Mideast peace effort.
   The House voted Wednesday to demand Japan pay for the 50,000
U.S. troops stationed on its soil under a security treaty. The
United States currently pays three-fifths of the $7.4 billion
annual bill.
   ``We have been doing our best for the effective implementation
of the Japan-U.S. security treaty, and we will continue to do so in
the future,'' Sakamoto said in a Tokyo news conference. ``But quite
logically, they are two separate matters.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who also has been criticized
in Congress for not helping the U.S. effort enough, promised
Thursday to lend ``a helping hand,'' though he did not whether the
Germans would provide money.
   In an interview at U.S. forces headquarters in Riyadh, commander
General H. Norman Schwarzkopf said the infusion of armored units
the next two months will provide a ``100 percent chance'' of
winning any battle with Iraqi forces.
   However, he said he was confident his forces would stop an Iraqi
attack now, despite logistical problems that have put the
deployment eight days behind.

   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter, in
style and substance early in his Senate confirmation hearings, is
proving what he had to: he's no Robert H. Bork.
   Souter, who spent many hours watching videotapes of Bork's 1987
performance, is using his appearance before the Senate Judiciary
Committee to distance himself from the lingering memory of Bork's
defeated high court nomination.
   To many, Bork the Senate witness seemed a bloodless academic who
talked about the ``intellectual feast'' Supreme Court service would
provide. He sometimes bristled at pointed questions and ignored
some softballs pitched by sympathetic senators.
   In contrast, many of Souter's responses Thursday were
embellished with personal anecdotes. And he has won praise from two
committee members for being ``a listener.''
   ``The Bork thing was extraordinary in its intensity, in what
occurred,'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said at one point. ``I don't
see any portent of that here.''
   Because too little is known about Souter's views on key
constitutional issues, he has not had to face the charges of
extremism that dogged Bork. But Souter, a 50-year-old New Hampshire
bachelor with an ascetic lifestyle, is working hard to dispel any
notion that he leads a life of disengaged isolation.
   At one point, he playfully complained about a senator's cutting
short one of his questions. ``You're going to turn me into a
laconic Yankee if you keep doing that,'' Souter said.
   After Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., pointed to several positions
Souter took as a state official and suggested that he was less than
sensitive to minorities' struggle for civil rights, Simpson put it
to the nominee bluntly. ``David Souter, are you a racist?''
   It was the type of question Bork might have dismissed with a
simple ``No.''
   But after responding, ``The answer is no,'' Souter went on to
deliver a moving soliloquy that left the usually loquacious Simpson
at a temporary loss for words.
   Souter recalled that he never heard his parents refer to any
human being in racial or ethnic terms. ``I am glad I am conditioned
by my beginnings,'' he said, ``and I am glad I do not have to
overcome them.''
   As the large hearing room grew increasingly silent, Souter
talked about the discrimination is longtime friend Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., knew as a young Jewish boy and the biases that
stung the Irish grandparents of Thomas Rath, a Concord lawyer and
another longtime friend.
   There was no such similar moment during the record five days
that Bork testified before the committee three years ago.
   Bork never let his Senate questioners make him embrace the
notion that the Constitution, although it doesn't say so
specifically, provides a general right of privacy.
   Souter, although no doubt a conservative, endorsed such a
constitutional right - the one on which the Supreme Court's Roe vs.
Wade decision legalizing abortion is based.
   He distanced himself from the doctrine of ``original intent'' -
in which judges seek to discover what the framers of a
constitutional provision wanted it to mean when it was written.
   Instead, Souter said constitutional provisions must be
interpreted in today's world - a position more identified with
retired Justice William J. Brennan, the liberal Souter seeks to
replace.
   As an example, Souter praised the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling
that outlawed racially segregated public schools. It was based on a
constitutional amendment adopted in 1868, when separation of the
races was strictly enforced by numerous laws.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., cited the nominee's comments on
that 1954 ruling to ``highlight the difference'' between Souter and
certain unnamed past nominees. The senator clearly had concluded
that no clone of Robert H. Bork sat before him.

<HEAD>Finalists Chosen By APME for Public Service Awards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Twenty newspapers have been chosen as finalists
in the Associated Press Managing Editors association's 20th annual
Public Service Awards competition.
   The finalists, announced Thursday, were picked from 122 entries
- 79 from newspapers with more than 50,000 circulation and 43 from
newspapers with less than 50,000 circulation.
   One winner from each category will be announced at the APME
convention in Dallas next month.
   ``The entries showed a remarkable commitment to report the news
in depth and expose corruption and incompetence in our
institutions,'' said Paul Janensch, immediate past president of
APME and chair of the judging committee.
   ``The smaller newspapers, with their limited staffs and budgets,
are especially deserving of praise,'' added Janensch, who is editor
and general manager of The Journal-News in Rockland County.
   Finalists in the less than 50,000 category, listed
alphabetically by city, are:
   The Albuquerque Tribune for its series, ``A Price on Their
Heads,'' exposing the threat to elk, eagles, bear and other
wildlife posed by animal traders, trophy hunters and poachers.
   The Bismarck (N.D.) Tribune for its investigation into the abuse
of children placed in foster homes on the Standing Rock Indian
Reservation.
   The Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune for its articles about the
state's lax regulation of insurance companies. The reporting
prompted the withdrawal of a gubernatorial candidate and the
resignation of the state insurance commissioner.
   The Columbia Missourian for a special report that concluded the
public housing authority was not only the city's largest landlord
but also the worst. This and other coverage led to the resignation
of the authority's executive director and its chairman.
   The Livingston (Mont.) Enterprise for comprehensive coverage by
its five-member news staff of the large and secretive Church
Universal and Triumphant and its damaging impact on an area
adjacent to Yellowstone National Park.
   The Sun News of Myrtle Beach, S.C., for providing detailed,
helpful, responsible coverage of Hurricane Hugo even though its
plant was disabled. The newspaper organized a print and broadcast
pool to report from the battered oceanfront.
   The West County Times of Richmond, Calif., for its series
exposing safety and environmental violations at the San Francisco
Bay area's six oil refineries. As a result, the state increased
minimum fines for pollution from $1,000 to $10,000.
   The Salina (Kan.) Journal for articles about use of excessive
force by city police officers. The report led to a state
investigation and the retirement of the police chief.
   The Valley News Dispatch of Tarentum, Pa., for a series that
painstakingly documented the failure of local officials to collect
more than $10 million in taxes owed to the area's 13 school
districts.
   The Washington (N.C.) Daily News for revealing that for eight
years city officials had known cancer-causing chemicals were in the
tap water. The disclosure resulted in a two-month water ban, an
improved treatment system and state and federal reviews of water
regulations.
   Finalists among newspapers with more than 50,000 circulation,
listed alphabetically by city, are:
   The Albuquerque Journal for discovering a link between the
dietary supplement L-tryptophan and a rare and sometimes deadly
blood disorder. Ten days after the first story was published, the
federal government banned the sale of the supplement.
   The Chicago Tribune for its series, ``A Dream in Jeopardy,'' a
comprehensive examination of cutbacks in corporate pensions and
health benefits and threats to the Social Security trust funds.
   The Des Moines Register for a series about the rape of an Iowa
woman and how she coped with the emotional trauma and legal ordeal
that followed. The woman's decision to be identified in the account
touched off a national debate over whether to keep secret the names
of rape victims.
   The Detroit News for uncovering the financial ties of the mayor
and police chief to a former deputy chief at the center of a
federal investigation into a secret police fund. Questionable
practices by the officials were documented in spite of the city
government's ``no comment'' policy when questioned by reporters.
   The Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader for its series, ``Cheating Our
Children,'' on political interference in the state's public schools
and the failure of local officials to collect property taxes owed
to financially-strapped school districts.
   The Courier-Journal of Louisville for a broad examination of
Kentucky's public-school crisis. Articles published over six months
included four in-depth series on flaws in the tax system, the
special problems in Appalachia, the need for preschool programs and
ways to improve teaching.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer for its series, ``The Blood Brokers,''
which lifted the veil from the unregulated, multi-billion dollar
business of buying and selling blood. Dog kennels in Pennsylvania
were inspected more often than blood banks, the series revealed.
   The San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News for its comprehensive
coverage of the Oct. 17 earthquake that devastated parts of
Northern California. The day after the disaster and during the
months that followed, readers received exhaustive reporting, vivid
writing, compelling photos and graphics, and public service
information.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer for its report, ``Chemicals Ride
the Food Chain,'' which revealed that truckers haul orange juice,
baby food and other cargo destined for human consumption after
carrying toxic chemicals in the same tanks. The disclosure resulted
in a new state law prohibiting such a practice and support for
similar legislation in the U.S. Congress.
   The Blade of Toledo, Ohio, for its series, ``The Secret Files of
Internal Affairs,'' based on a review of 200,000 city police
disciplinary documents never before made public. The seven-month
project revealed that the department failed to prosecute officers
for assault, drunken driving and other crimes and that 98 percent
of citizens' complaints of police brutality were dismissed.
   The judges of the APME Public Service Awards competition are
past presidents of APME. The 1990 judges, in addition to Janensch,
were:
   Larry Allison, senior vice president and editor of the Long
Beach (Calif.) Press-Telegram; James F. Daubel, editor and
publisher of the News-Messenger of Fremont, Ohio; Robert H. Giles,
editor and publisher of The Detroit News; Robert J. Haiman,
president of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, St.
Petersburg, Fla.; Ted M. Natt, editor and publisher of The Daily
News of Longview, Wash.; and Robert E. Rhodes, Atwood Professor of
Journalism at the University of Alaska at Anchorage.

   Higher oil prices from the tensions in
the Persian Gulf have opened a rift in the governing party over
Sweden's plan to abolish nuclear power in 20 years.
   At least half the delegates to the Social Democratic Party
congress, which begins Saturday, want to postpone the nuclear
shutdown, recent polls show.
   About 25 percent of Sweden's total energy - and 50 percent of
its electricity - come from nuclear power.
   ``The opinion over when to abolish nuclear power is divided
within the party,'' Sweden's Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said to
the news agency TT last week.
   In 1980, a year after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in
Pennsylvania, Swedes voted to start shutting down their nuclear
energy plants in 1995.
   Oil has been viewed as the most likely alternative to nuclear
power, but the surge in price after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2 has reminded Swedes of how much their plan could cost. The
price of gasoline in Sweden is already among the highest in the
world, mostly because of taxes. A gallon costs about $5.
   ``To cut the nuclear power at a fast pace, we would be forced to
use oil as an energy source in the meantime. Nuclear power is
relatively inexpensive compared to the high oil prices,''
acknowledged Bertil Karlberg, a party official.
   He said the Social Democrats want to replace nuclear energy with
power sources such as wind and sun.
   But Sven Bengtsson, an energy expert at the Ministry of
Industry, said, ``With not a lot of sunshine in Sweden, solar
energy is out of the question. Also, even if wind power is
implemented on a large scale, it can only replace a small part of
the total energy output.''
   A poll published early this week by Eureka Research said 52
percent of the 80 party delegates it interviewed wanted to delay
the nuclear shutdown. A party paper said Thursday that nearly 50
percent of the 350 delegates wanted to reconsider the schedule for
closing plants, which was established by Parliament in 1988.
   The issue promises to produce the most controversial debates of
the six-day congress. The meeting, held every three years, is the
highest decision-making body of the Social Democratic Party.
   Influential Social Democrats, such as union leader Stig Malm and
Minister of Energy Rune Molin, have said the deadline for
abolishing nuclear power should be reconsidered - at the least.
   Molin went further: ``There is a lot speaking in favor of
changing everything,'' he said.
   Minister of Environment Birgitta Dahl opposes any delay in the
shutdown and says the most important consideration is the damage a
nuclear accident can cause.
   Radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet
Union four years ago reinforced Swedish public opinion against
nuclear power. Radioactive particles brought by the wind and rain
contaminated the plants that reindeer eat, forcing the Lapps in
northern Sweden to slaughter hundreds of the animals they depend on
for food.

   Four newspapers are finalists in the annual
Freedom of Information Award competition sponsored by the
Associated Press Managing Editors association.
   The finalists were announced Thursday by David Hawpe, editor of
The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., chairman of the APME
Freedom of Information Committee.
   The newspapers chosen are:
   The Detroit News, for an investigation tracing payments from a
secret Detroit police fund, through which more than $1 million in
taxpayer money was said to be laundered. The complex story touched
on the activities of a deputy police chief, Mayor Coleman Young and
others.
   The Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun-Sentinel, for a series on the
state of Florida's failure to impose adequate contros on care
centers, leading to client deaths and injuries among such diverse
groups as infants, retarded adults and teen-age criminals.
   The Daily Reflector of Greenville, N.C., for revelations
concerning the background of a candidate for Superior Court judge,
resulting in legislation changing state law to open the records of
the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission.
   The Hartford (Conn.) Courant, for an examination of the
government's military recruiting system that suggested it promotes
corruption, undermines quality of the armed forces, and costs
taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
   The winning entry will be announced at the APME convention in
October in Dallas.

   If it comes to war, military analysts say, the
United States and its allies could drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait,
but only with a land assault against a dug-in Iraqi army that might
result in thousands of American casualties.
   For comparisons, one expert calls up the bloody island-to-island
Pacific warfare against the Japanese in World War II; another
reaches further back to the British battle against the Germans
along the Somme River in France during World War I. In the first 30
minutes of that fight, 19,240 British soldiers were killed or
mortally wounded.
   ``If we have to fight them, the only thing that worries me is
how many Americans get killed,'' said retired Adm. Thomas H.
Moorer, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``No one
knows the answer to that.''
   The experts were asked a few simple but troubling questions as
the massive buildup of American and allied forces continued apace
on the Saudi Arabian peninsula:
   If war comes, would the American side win?
   At what cost?
   How long would it take?
   ``That's a ridiculous question; of course we can win,'' said an
incredulous Moorer, 78, who was shot down over the Pacific in 1942
and rescued by a freighter, only to have it bombed out from under
him.
   ``It just depends on will and determination,'' Moorer added.
``It doesn't have anything to do with capability. We are capable,
and then some.''
   In interviews, a variety of military analysts agreed with that
assessment and made this addtional points:
   - The allies aren't ready to launch an offensive against Iraqi
forces occupying Kuwait and won't be until the American contingent,
now numbering 100,000, is twice as large, perhaps not until late
October.
   ``If Iraq has 200,000 men in Kuwait, then you'd want a sizeable
American advantage before you launch an attack,'' said James A.
Blackwell Jr., analyst with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies and former West Point instructor. He sees a
need for 200,000 U.S. troops, augmented by 50,000 to 100,000 Arab
soldiers as well as forces from other countries.
   - Iraq cannot be ejected from Kuwait militarily without a ground
war. It can't be done from the air or with high-tech warfare alone.
   ``I don't think you can win it by bombing Iraq,'' said Jack N.
Meritt, a retired four-star Army general who was the U.S.
representative to NATO's military committee. ``We've been trying
that since World War II and there has been no case in history where
you've been able to defeat a force on the ground from the air.''
   - Fighting the Iraqis in Kuwait would be difficult; fighting
them on the ground in Iraq would be infinitely more difficult.
   Said Harry G. Summers Jr., a retired Army colonel, combat
infantry veteran of Korea and Vietnam and fellow of the Army War
College: ``If we set the goal as the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait,
then the cost will be high, but not nearly what it would be if we
tried to conquer Iraq. I can't imagine anybody being that dumb as
to take on that task.''
   - It is important, militarily and politically, that Arab and
other allied forces be in the midst of the fighting.
   ``You wouldn't want to lead with American forces, you'd want
Arab forces to take the immediate action,'' said Blackwell. ``It's
important to keep the coalition together. This can't become an
American war.''
   - While the United States has been building up, the Iraqis have
been digging in, preparing to do what they did best in the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Said Blackwell: ``If Saddam Hussein orders his Iraqi occupiers
to fight to the death in Kuwait City and secure their place in
heaven - Jiminy Christmas that's a long fight, months. Not to
mention the tens of thousands of casualties in such a fight.''
   Summers, to illustrate the difficulties of going against an
entrenched enemy, drew a parallel with the battle on the Somme on
July 1, 1916, when there was enormous British bloodshed in just
minutes.
   ``That gives you the outside parameter of what kind of
casualties can result from assaulting fortified positions head
on,'' he said. ``You can go much lower, but still it is probably
the most difficult'' kind of warfare.
   ``We need to remember that they Iraqis fought the Iran-Iraq war
primarily on the defensive. That is by far the strongest form of
war. It is not decisive, but it can certainly cause enormous
casualties.''
   Added Blackwell: ``If they're defending the city room by room to
the death, we're back to island-clearing operations in the Pacific
in World War II.''
   On the other hand, the Americans have significant advantages.
   ``We own the night with our military force,'' said Merritt.
``All our tanks and aircraft are night fighters. We might be so
effective so quickly that we can destroy their morale and keep our
casualties down. ...In the main and on the average, we're
technologically far superior and our training is far superior.''
   He added that there's much talk about Saddam's
``battle-hardened'' army, ``but it is also a battle-weary army.''
   And Moorer pointed out that while Saddam has 5,500 tanks ``many
are obsolete.'' Because of the blockade, ``he's going to have spare
parts problems to keep his machines going.''
   He said Saddam ``could make a big noise for two or three days,
but in my view he doesn't have sustainability.''
   American commanders in the field exude confidence that they can
prevail. The commander of American forces, Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, said the American technological advantage should not
be discounted.
   ``We would be using capabilities that are far more lethal, far
more accurate and far more effective than anything we have ever
used,'' he said.
   And Marine Maj. Gen. Royal N. Moore said the U.S. attack would
pulverize Iraq's defenses in minutes.
   ``We want about three to five minutes, and we're going to give
them the most violent three to five minutes they've ever seen,''
Moore said. ``That's all we want.''
   But, he cautioned: ``I'm not going to ever predict that it's
going to be a cakewalk. If we do it right, the casualties will be
light, we hope.''

   When Capt. Francisco Mena deserted
the army and joined El Salvador's guerrillas, they greeted him with
tentative embraces, hard stares and skepticism.
   For a year, a veteran fighter known as Fredy never let Mena walk
behind him.
   ``There was a ceremony that was a bit awkward,'' Mena, who
changed sides in 1981, told an interviewer. ``I gave a talk and
afterward the guerrillas began asking questions.''
   Some of those questions, he said, were: ``Why did you stay so
long in the army? How many operations did you take part in? How
many of us have you killed?
   `` `Damn,' I thought. `What have I gotten myself into? Here I
came to help these guys, and they're busting my chops','' Mena
said.
   He smiled at the recollection and brushed one hand through his
wavy black hair. The 47-year-old rebel commander was in the
delegation that, on Aug. 22, ended a fruitless round of peace talks
here with the government of Alfredo Cristiani, the Salvadoran
president.
   A nearly 11-year-old civil war between the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front and a succession of U.S.-backed
governments has killed an estimated 72,000 people, most of them
civilians.
   The trip to Costa Rica was Mena's first involvement in the
monthly negotiations and his first respite from the fighting in
years.
   He was included because the exclusive subject of the talks this
month was a rebel demand that the armed forces be purged of corrupt
officers and reformed. That issue is the main sticking point in the
negotations.
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, as a member of the government delegation,
protects the military's interests at the talks.
   Officially, the Salvadoran military holds Mena in contempt. In
the words of Col. Orlando Zepeda, vice minister of defense: ``That
traitor and murderer has no moral right to make accusations or
demands on us.''
   Classmates at the military and some other officers, however,
have demonstrated a camaraderie with Mena that could help promote
eventual accord.
   Lt. Col. Mauricio Duke shook hands and chatted amiably with
Mena, his former superior, when they met in the lobby of the hotel
where the talks were held.
   Mena gave a copy of his book, ``From the National Army to the
Guerrilla Army,'' to Duke, who responded with a sly smile:
``Gracias, my captain.''
   The copy, like another sent to Vargas, was inscribed: ``Let's
not forget the 15th of October.''
   That is the date in 1979 when young officers - Vargas, Mena and
Duke included - overthrew the rightist dictatorship of Gen. Carlos
Humberto Romero.
   A broad-based government whose objective was national
reconciliation resulted, but a purge of the military old guard
faltered. Repression and death squads followed, and the result was
civil war.
   Mena traces his change of heart to a year as an officer of the
National Guard, a militarized police force.
   He described counterinsurgency tactics that included torture,
rape and murder of alleged leftists, and told of an initiation rite
during which he declined an invitation to drive a bayonet through
the heart of a suspect.
   While he pondered such brutality later in his air-conditioned
office, Mena said, the suspect and 11 others were killed in the
gymnasium of the National Guard headquarters.
   ``That kind of thing consolidated my change of thinking by
making me profoundly question the role we military men were
playing,'' he said. ``It became denigrating for me to wear the
National Guard insignia.''
   The proclamation issued by those who carried out the 1979 coup
promised respect for human rights, an end to corruption and
modernization of a semifeudal economy that left most Salvadorans
destitute.
   Peace is possible if military authorities honor those goals,
Mena said, but added: ``The picture is this: We're getting nowhere
in negotiations, so let's have at it with the irons.''
   Fredy, the guerrilla fighter so wary of Mena, was killed in
combat in 1985.
   Just before he died, Mena said, they had a conversation in which
Fredy told him:
   ``In those early days I didn't trust you a bit, like you were
still the enemy. Who ever would have believed that we'd come to be
like brothers, that I'd gladly give my life for you?''

<HEAD>Storm Warning: '90s May See More Hurricanes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A weather expert is issuing a long-term storm
warning for people living along the Atlantic and Florida coasts.
   This decade and the early years of the 21st century could see a
return to more frequent and stronger hurricanes, such as those that
battered the region before a recent period of relative calm.
   The reason: The drought-plagued Sahel region in West Africa
seems to be moving into a moister period. Historically, when that
happens, more hurricanes form in the Atlantic and they are stronger
than the tropical cyclones of other years.
   The warning came from William M. Gray, a professor of
atmospheric science at Colorado State University, writing in
today's edition of Science, the journal of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
   Gray said the ``intense Caribbean hurricanes Gilbert, Joan and
Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change.''
   Relatively few intense hurricanes affected the United States
between 1970 and 1987, a period when the Sahel region suffered a
severe drought, Gray noted.
   The principal beneficiaries, he said, were the East Coast,
Caribbean Basin and the Florida peninsula.
   ``It is these coastal areas, not so much the Gulf Coast, that
will likely see the largest upswing in landfall of intense
hurricanes when a long period of heavier rainfall returns again to
West Africa,'' Gray said.
   If past variations are an indication of the future, he wrote,
``we should expect an eventual recurrence of somewhat heavier
Western Sahel precipitation, possibly during the 1990s and the
early years of the 21st century.''
   ``With such a rainfall increase, we should also expect a return
of more frequent intense hurricane activity in the Caribbean basin
and along the U.S. coastline,'' Gray added.
   During the years of relatively few hurricanes, coastal
poplations have grown rapidly, and Gray said residents of these
areas need to be wary in the coming years.
   The federal Climate Analysis Center, meanwhile, reported that
while much of north and central Africa is dry, rainfall increased
in July and early August in large areas of the western Sahel. The
region also was relatively moist in 1988 and 1989.
   Gray rummaged through historical records and found that the
Sahel seems to alternate with long periods of dry conditions
followed by moister times. For example, it was wet from about 1870
to 1900, 1915 to 1935 and 1947 to 1969.
   Records are poor for the earliest period, but Gray found that
the Atlantic and Caribbean region averaged 5.52 days per year of
intense hurricanes from 1915 to 1935 and 8.53 days between 1947 and
1969. By contrast, the dry periods in between averaged between 2.1
and 2.5 days of intense hurricanes.
   Why should rain in Africa cause hurricanes to hit the United
States?
   Atlantic hurricanes are powerful storms that tend to originate
just north of the Equator, in a region where trade winds come
together to create rising air currents.
   When the ocean is warm, 80 degrees Fahrenheit or more, it helps
create hurricanes. This water warms the air along its surface,
causing it to rise. As that air rises, the seawater it holds
evaporates, a process that forms clouds and at the same time heats
the air even more and causes it to continue rising. This gives
strength to the storm.
   Weather disturbances move off the coast of Africa over the ocean
50 or more times a year. Some of them generate hurricanes by
helping this moist rising air organize into a churning storm.
   It's not the number of African disturbances that matters, said
Gray, but the fact that in moist years they are better organized
into storms themselves, and move more slowly across the ocean,
building strength as they go.

<HEAD>Enrollment Dips At Schools As Foreigners Flee Gulf</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enrollment at international schools
has plummeted as foreign workers and their families head home to
escape tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   And the expatriates who remain say they cope with the standoff
by holding discussions on Middle East events and staging ``duck and
cover'' drills.
   The foreign community in Saudi Arabia has shrunk drastically
since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Roughly 5,000 Americans
left the country's eastern province. A few have trickled back.
   At the Saudi Aramco Schools, enrollment is about one-fifth of
normal. When school opened Saturday, 410 students showed up, down
from 2,010 projected before the crisis.
   The Aramco schools, kindergarten through ninth grade, are run by
the oil-producing company Aramco for the children of foreigners.
   The Dhahran Academy, a private school for expatriates, will open
Sept. 15, two weeks later than expected. Only 600 students, half
the normal number, have signed up, said principal Don Kirkpatrick.
There are few Americans in the classes, he said.
   The low enrollment is also apparent at Dhahran Hills Junior High
School. Nancy Hicks' seventh-grade language class had two rows of
empty seats.
   ``I thought more of my friends would be here,'' said 12-year-old
Miriam France who returned from Denver, Colo., two days ago. Many
people, including junior high vice principal Bill Vahey, have put
their children in shools in the United States for this fall's
term.
   Vahey's wife and family are in Hilton Head, S.C., but they
expect to come back to Saudi Arabia in late October.
   A U.S. government advisory suggests dependents of foreigner
workers stay out of Saudi Arabia's eastern province.
   John McClung, 12, of Oceanside, Calif., said his family planned
to stay in the United States, but his father changed his mind after
talking to Aramco officials.
   Teachers and students showed little concern for their security,
although they wanted to talk about the crisis and the presence of
U.S. troops in the province.
   ``We have discussed the apprehension,'' Vahey said. ``I went
into one class and gave them some political backround.''
   ``I don't feel they are tense but they want to talk about it,''
Ms. Hicks said.
   Ms. Hicks said she and her husband, a structural engineer, were
determined not to let the invasion intimidate them. They are just
months shy of retirement, she said.
   ``I resented that person causing all this disruption,'' Ms.
Hicks said, referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Several teachers, however, have resigned because of the
political uncertainty, she said.
   The school is taking measures in case of attack.
   The evacuation plan has been updated and the basement has been
converted into a bomb shelter stocked with water, flashlights and
canned goods, Vahey said.
   ``Duck and cover'' drills have been held, with children diving
under desks and covering their heads with their arms, he said.
   For some students, the gulf crisis has not changed their
feelings about heading to class.
   ``It's not as exciting as it used to be,'' said John McClung.
``School is boring.''

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A towering Soviet soldier smashes a swastika
with a giant sword. Marx stares at passing traffic. Cars roll down
Ho Chi Minh. Lenin tugs on his lapel.
   Germany is less than three weeks away from becoming a single
bastion of Western capitalism, but much of the new nation will be
filled with totems to the old East Germany.
   While leaders argue over how to pay for unification and East
Germans worry about their jobs, many towns are wondering what to do
with all those old statues, streets, squares and schools dedicated
to the stalwarts of socialism.
   It is a problem far more complex than merely changing street
signs and carting away scowling icons of stone and bronze.
   In southern East Germany, Karl Marx City wasted little time
reclaiming its historical name, Chemnitz.
   But it is taking much longer to decide what to do with Karl
himself, a huge, glowering bust that dwarfs tourists who stare at
his gargantuan noggin in the heart of town.
   No community has taken a greater interest in this issue than
East Berlin, the showcase of the former Communist government and
the historic heart of what will be the capital of a united nation.
   An estimated 800 postwar monuments dot the cityscape, some of
them the centerpieces of squares. In Leninplatz, the Soviet
revolutionary is affixed to a jagged panel, scowling in flowing
overcoat, one hand on his lapel and the other clenched at his side.
   In Marx-Engels Platz, Engels stands erect while Marx sits at his
side, his huge lap a favorite place for tourists to nestle for
photo opportunities.
   A committee of artists and historians convened last week to
begin an monument-by-monument appraisal of what to do with the
memorials. A similiar committee has been charged with examining
street names.
   Some Germans want to remove all remnants of the regime imposed
by the Soviets after World War II. Others say they should, to some
extent, be preserved.
   ``Monuments, even if they are horrible or an attack against good
taste, are part of the postwar history here,'' said Klaus Hetzel, a
spokesman for the East Berlin government. ``You can find other
solutions for them.''
   The East Berlin committee members believe many statues will be
retained but altered, perhaps by adding plaques that put them in
historical perspective.
   Others may have new gardens or green spaces around them to
soften them.
   Still others may be carted away to a single location, becoming
part of a museum that will in a sense be a graveyard of Communist
artifacts.
   ``What we do not want to do is merely get rid of everything,''
said Richard Dahlheim, deputy chairman of the city's Cultural
Affairs Department. ``Too many historical remnants are lost to the
emotions of the moment.''
   Few monuments trigger more emotions than the giant Soviet
memorial in East Berlin's charming Treptow Park. Many people are
stunned by the militaristic scope of this tribute to Soviet
soldiers who died while conquering Germany from the east.
   To see it, a visitor follows a path lined with birch trees
leading to a pedestal of stairs. Two red granite walls shaped like
drooping flags form a gateway. Two giant Soviet soldiers kneel in
front of each wall.
   On the other side is a lawn that stretches for more than 550
yards, the burial place for 5,000 Soviet soldiers. On each side are
eight stone sacrcophagi depicting feats of heroism.
   At the end of the lawn is a mausoleum on which a 38-foot-high
soldier stands. Broad-shouldered and handsome, the soldier smashes
a swastika with a sword and clutches a child, creating an idealized
image of a Soviet avenger slaying the Nazi oppressors and saving
the innocent.
   Many Germans want it shipped back to the Soviets.
   ``Marx is okay, but get rid of that thing,'' said Werner
Tischer, 72, a native Berliner.
   West Berlin also has monuments to its World War II occupiers,
including a Soviet memorial and a street named after Karl Marx.
Hetzel said it will be up to a future united Berlin government what
should remain or be modified.
   An estimated 100 to 200 streets are being studied by the East
Berlin streets committee, ranging from streets named after Salvador
Allende, the former Marxist leader of Chile; to Konstantin
Ziolkowski, a father of Soviet flight technology.
   They already have decided to change the name of Otto Grotewohl
street, named after the first East German prime minister who was a
hard-line Stalinist.
   One broad avenue Americans are always startled to see is named
after Ho Chi Minh, the Communist leader who drove the Americans out
of Vietnam.
   There is even a Wall Street. Its namesake nearby, however, has
been reduced to rubble.

   Miss Pennsylvania Marla Wynne, who finished in
the top 10 during the Miss America Pageant, says talk show host
Larry King's disparaging remarks about her still sting.
   ``If he knew the work and the hours and the blood, sweat and
tears that went into it, he wouldn't have been so quick to be so
insensitive,'' she said on the ``Joan Rivers Show,'' taped for
broadcast today.
   King, the host of a Cable News Network talk show, was a judge
for the pageant, which culminated Saturday with the finals. He was
asked by Rivers earlier this week which contestant was ``the
ugliest of the group.''
   Without hesitating, he answered, ``Pennsylvania.''
   ``She was one of the 10 finalists and she did a great
ventriloquist bit,'' he said. ``The dummy was prettier.''
   King later sent Wynne a telegram apologizing, saying, ``In this
case, I'm the real dummy.''

   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Rodney Dangerfield left 'em laughing after
three days of testimony in his lawsuit against Ceasars Palace.
   The comedian's lawyers surprised a federal judge Thursday by
resting their case after calling only Dangerfield and a hotel
employee as witnesses.
   Dangerfield contends he suffered a serious eye injury in a steam
bath at the resort in March 1988. He completed his combative and
contradictive testimony with a flourish, getting jurors and
spectators to laugh as he told a joke to demonstrate how he uses
his eyes in his stage act.
   ``My dog found out we look alike. So he killed himself,''
Dangerfield said, his eyes bulging for effect.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Foley recessed the trial until Monday.
   Dangerfield, 68, is suing Caesars for $225,000 in lost wages and
$5 million in punitive damages. Caesars countersued, seeking
$100,000 and punitive damages.

   Football coach Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears is
trying to cut the mustard in a new business - Ditka Dogs.
   Ditka's signature frozen pork chops already grace some grocery
freezers. Now, he's expanding to a $1.8 million fast-food
restaurant to open next month in suburban Naperville.
   It will be a place ``where local people can go,'' he recently
told Food Industry News.
   Ditka has a one-third stake in Ditka Dogs, which hopes to open
10 franchises over three years.
   Ditka already operates three regional restaurants that offer a
somewhat more exotic cuisine than hot dogs, sandwiches and salads.

   BOSTON (AP) - Former tennis champion Arthur Ashe Jr. says he
considers the concept of affirmative action laws insulting but
important.
   Ashe, who is black, expressed the mixed sentiment Thursday
before a commencement crowd of 1,300 at Northeastern University.
   ``Affirmative action has provided many opportunities for
thousands of dispossessed minorities, precisely because many
organizations and institutions would not have acted otherwise,'' he
said.
   ``Yet the very concept is insulting to me. I don't want
affirmative action, I want human parity,'' Ashe said.
   Ashe, who played during the 1960s and '70s, won every Grand Slam
tournament except the French Open.

   Buttery croissants are traditional at
breakfast in France, but an Agriculture Department report says corn
flakes and other cereals are gaining favor.
   Sales of breakfast cereals in France rose 25 percent in value
last year, following a growth of more than 80 percent from 1985 to
1988.
   The report in the October issue of AgExporter magazine said 1989
imports of breakfast cereals into France were valued at $5.9
million and totaled 30,496 metric tons, or 92 percent of total
sales.
   Most of the imports came from West Germany, where Kellogg's -
the most popular brand on French store shelves - has a plant. Other
major suppliers were Britain and Italy.
   Although imports from the United States were ``insignificant,
and have been for several years,'' the report said there is room
for competition.
   ``There is potential for U.S. cereal sales, particularly for
new, innovative products targeted at a niche market and distributed
through speciality stores,'' the report said.
   No one expects French-consumed breakfast cereals to drain the
U.S. corn bin right away, however. The USDA's latest crop estimate
issued this week pointed to a corn harvest of 8.12 billion bushels,
up 8 percent from last year.
   The September estimate has helped push down prices at the farm,
now protected by USDA economists at an average of $2.10 to $2.50
per bushel in the corn marketing year that began Sept. 1. That was
down 25 cents a bushel from the projected season price a month ago.
   Although the biggest uses of corn are domestic livestock feeding
and exports, the cereal market is not to be sneezed at.
   The USDA groups together a selection of uses for corn as ``food,
seed and industrial'' purposes. Wet-milled products such as
sweeteners, starch and alcohol are included, as well as dry-milled
and cooked products, plus corn used for seed.
   Altogether, in the 1989-90 marketing year that just ended, 1.28
billion bushels of corn were required to fill those demands.
   This year, according to the latest projections, the use of corn
for those purposes is expected to gain further to about 1.3 billion
bushels.
   ``Most of the increase likely will be in the wet milling sector
among the corn sweeteners and alcohol,'' said the department's
Economic Research Service. ``Dry milling will likely use about the
same amount.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department has been told to
use ethanol or ETBE blends of gasoline in government vehicles as a
way of confronting the Mideast oil crunch.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the use of ethanol
and ETBE, or ethyl tertiary butyl ether, in the department's cars
and trucks is required if the fuels are available at prices
competitive to regular unleaded gasoline.
   ``Ethanol is produced from American corn and other agricultural
products, and that's good for American farmers,'' Yeutter said
Thursday.
   It also helps reduce U.S. dependency on foreign oil, he said.
President Bush in his speech Tuesday night to Congress said ``fuel
switching'' would be one way to ease the nation's dependency on oil
imports.
   ``This is a great way for each of us, as individuals and as
members of USDA, to demonstrate our commitment to America's
farmers, America's environment and America's future,'' Yeutter said
in a statement.
   The USDA operates more than 33,000 cars and light trucks in all
50 states. If all were fueled with ethanol-blended gasoline, they
would use about 1.7 million gallons of ethanol a year, which would
require 680,000 bushels of corn.
   On Wednesday, the department estimated this fall's corn harvest
at 8.12 billion bushels. Department analysts say about 220 million
bushels of corn were used for fuel in 1989-90, up from 210 million
the previous year. A further increase is expected in the corn
marketing year that began Sept. 1.
   Yeutter noted that the availability of ethanol and ETBE blends
of gasoline varies from state to state. He also urged the
department's 100,000 employees to use the blends in their personal
vehicles.
   Spokeswoman Kelly Shipp said Yeutter's staff was ``looking
around'' for a local source of blended fuel to use in USDA cars
carrying the secretary and other senior officials. So far, none had
been found, she said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department says there is a
record supply of tree nuts, except for walnuts.
   A USDA report said Thursday that the ``burdensome'' supply of
nuts expected in 1990-91 probably will ``result in lower grower
prices'' because consumption has not kept pace in recent years.

   Steven Balourdos was tired of the glitz along the
city's Magnificent Mile, so he did what he used to do back home in
Greece. He planted tomatoes. Some of his neighbors are less than
enthusiastic, but Balourdos says he's standing by his fruit.
   ``I feel very strongly to do what I do back home,'' Balourdos
said Thursday. He emigrated from a tomato-growing region in the
1950s and runs a business on Michigan Avenue.
   ``You see a lot of diamonds, you see a lot of mink coats, you
see a lot of Rolls-Royces, but you don't see any tomatoes on
Michigan Avenue,'' he said.
   Earlier this summer, Balourdos had a yearning for some
earthiness to counterbalance the downtown shopping street's glitter
and haute couture.
   He planted about 30 tomato plants in square granite containers
on the sidewalk outside a high-rise where he runs his second-story
real estate development company. Only four spindly plants remain.
The rest have been ripped out by unknown foes.
   The building's association of condominium owners contends
tomatoes may be fine in pasta primavera but a makeshift garden has
no place on Michigan Avenue.
   ``I do not believe that those tomato plants are an asset to the
front of our building, bearing in mind the beauty of all of the
other buildings on the Avenue,'' said the association's president,
Marilyn Lewis.
   Planters outside other buildings on the street contain exotic
flowers, neatly pruned trees and shrubs.
   ``We just don't fit in,'' Mrs. Lewis said of the tomato plants.
   The majority of the association's nine board members agreed that
the tomatoes are an affront the avenue's aesthetic standards, Mrs.
Lewis said.
   ``I don't know whether he thinks he's a comedian or what,'' said
resident, Eleanor Folta, 81. ``I guess he thinks he can do whatever
he wants.''
   ``We can pray for a quick frost and that'll take care of that,''
she said.
   Balourdos has refused to back down. The condo association is
considering complaining to the Greater North Michigan Avenue
Association, which has guidelines recommending plants on the street
be ``beautiful and low-key,'' spokeswoman Jane Driscoll said.
   Ms. Driscoll said she didn't know if her organization would
formally object to the tomato plants. The group can issue only
recommendations and has no enforcement powers, she said.
   The owner of a nearby jewelry store can't understand the fuss.
   ``If they were ripe, I'd go pick the tomatoes instead of going
to the store,'' said Henry Kaplan, owner of Henry Kay Jewelers.
   Balourdos says he's received more than two dozen letters of
support. He pledged to go to court, if necessary, to keep his
beloved plants in sight outside his office window.
   ``Hundreds of people have stopped their cars to see the tomatoes
on Michigan Avenue,'' he said. ``People pass by and they touch it,
it's a great feeling.''

<HEAD>House Approves National Service Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $193 million bill encouraging young people
to volunteer for community service projects won House passage
despite a veto threat from the White House.
   The National Service Act, approved on a voice vote Thursday, now
goes to a conference committee to resolve differences with a
version passed by the Senate last spring.
   The Senate version is less costly and contains a key provision
not included by the House - a $35 million demonstration program
providing financial aid to college students and first-time
homebuyers in exchange for community volunteer work.
   Democratic backers of that provision reluctantly supported the
bill and said they would try to have it restored in conference.
   ``This is not national service,'' said Rep. Dave McCurdy,
D-Okla., one of the sponsors of tying financial aid to youth
service. ``... This is a very weak image of what we saw as national
service.''
   The idea was the outgrowth of a proposal by the Democratic
Leadership Council, a group of moderate and conservative Democrats
trying to push their party toward the political right.
   Without that provision, the House bill would provide money for
federal grants to states to establish programs in the schools
encouraging community service volunteer work and incorporating the
service into school curricula.
   It would set up an American Conservation Corps to perform
volunteer projects for conservation, historical and cultural
projects. It would establish a Youth Service Corps, as part of the
existing ACTION volunteer program, to perform volunteer service in
social programs including nursing homes, day care centers and other
non-profit organizations.
   The Senate's $35 million demonstration program would provide
young people vouchers of up to $5,000 - good for higher education
or first-home purchases - in return for a year's volunteer work.
   That provision was strongly opposed by Rep. Gus Hawkins,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee,
which removed it before sending the bill to the floor. Hawkins told
the House his bill ``rejects any linkage between service and
student financial assistance.''
   ``This bill is an attempt to make the concept of service more
central to Americans' life and work,'' Hawkins said.
   Republicans opposed the measure as too costly and unnecessary,
and some said government involvement would actually discourage
people to do volunteer work.
   ``Here we are today, in the midst of deficit reduction, saying
`Let's pass another program ... a centralized bureaucracy for
volunteerism,''' said Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis.
   ``It's unnecessary,'' added Rep. Thomas Petri, R-Wis. ``The
volunteer service is alive and well and just doesn't need
government messing around with it.''
   The White House budget office said in a statement that Bush's
advisers would recommend he veto the bill if enacted in the version
approved by the House. The statement said the measure is too
costly, provides unneeded financial incentives and is an ``attempt
to direct community service efforts from the federal level rather
than from the community.''
   The bill provides for government student aid loans to be
deferred and partially canceled for students who perform fulltime
volunteer community service, are professionally employed in drug
counseling or do fulltime volunteer work providing health care to
American Indians.
   The House defeated, 212-200, a move by Republicans to eliminate
the loan cancellation provision, which they said would cause untold
cost to the government. Sponsors, however, said it would amount to
only $500,000 a year.

<HEAD>Haitian Elections in Doubt Under Caretaker Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - After 186 years of authoritarian
rule, mostly out of the barrel of a gun, democracy has again been
deferred on this impoverished Caribbean island.
   The postponement of elections has threatened to unravel the
caretaker civilian government of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
and raised new doubts about whether Haiti can succeed in its march
toward democracy.
   ``She cannot make good on her pledge to hold genuine elections,
so her administration has lost its reason to exist,'' said Gerard
Pierre-Charles, one of Haiti's most respected political analysts.
``We are sliding inexorably towards the temptation of a military
coup.''
   The independent Electoral Council, charged by the constitution
with organizing free and fair balloting, said last week it was
postponing the Nov. 4 elections until sometime in December for lack
of funds.
   But critics say the problem is more than money. They accuse
Pascal-Trouillot's 6-month-old transitional government with
corruption and ineptness.
   During her short term, Haiti has been beset by a crime wave,
unpunished political murders and growing poverty in what is already
one of the world's poorest countries.
   ``The problem of elections is not only technical; it is
political. The government looks down its nose at the prerequisites
of justice and security,'' said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a member of the
12-party Unity Assembly politcal coalition.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a former Supreme Court judge, was
appointed by the Unity Assembly on March 13 after the fall of Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril, who had taken power in September 1988 during a
soldiers' rebellion that toppled the previous government.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was to govern jointly with a Council of
State, a quasi-legislative body of 19 prominent Haitians.
   The government's main task was to lead Haiti to its first free
elections since independence from France in 1804.
   It is the country's fifth government since Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled to exile in France in 1986, ending 29 years of dictatorial
Duvalier-family rule.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot has had the support of the United States.
It has tied renewal of economic aid, cut after an Election Day
massacre in 1987, to democratic elections.
   Five presidential candidates considered strong contenders
disavow any efforts to unseat the president before elections. But
seven political parties in the Unity Assembly have called for her
resignation and say they will boycott the vote if she is president.
   They made the appeal after the Council of State broke relations
with her on Aug. 14. Council members charged she was an obstacle to
elections, and five Cabinet ministers later resigned.
   ``We can say she has continually acted in bad faith, in
violation of the conditions of her appointment,'' said Dr. Louis
Roy, president of the council. ``Her policy to avoid confrontation
with the most retrograde and criminal elements ... has led us to
this impasse.''
   The council charges she has not abided by an accord signed with
political leaders to institute urgent administrative, judicial and
military reforms.
   The president has also alienated labor unions and businessmen
who believe mismanagement of funds is behind a $30 million budget
deficit - $20 million of which accrued since April.
   Misgivings perhaps could have been overlooked had the government
investigated the murder of council member Serge Villard, who was
shot and killed in broad daylight on June 21 by men linked to the
army. Also killed in the attack was a union activist.
   There have been no arrests, even though more than a dozen people
witnessed the shooting.
   A month after the assassinations, two figures linked to brutal
previous regimes returned to the country from exile and remain at
large, despite warrants for their arrest.
   Many fear year's vote could be disrupted by the return of Roger
Lafontant, whose feared Tontons Macoute militia kept the Duvalier
family in power, and retired Maj. Gen. Williams Regala.
   Regala was head of security during the November 1987 massacre of
34 voters at the polls by thugs working in collusion with the army.
   Voter registration is set for Oct. 5. But the Electoral Council
said it will suspend election activities if voters do not sign up
in sufficient numbers to give credibility to the next government.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot has vowed to remain in office until
elections.
   Despite the uncertainty, many Haitians still hold out hope that
Haiti will not return to the tyranny of the past. ``The popular
desire for democracy is too deeply rooted to be eradicated,'' said
the analyst, Pierre-Charles.

<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS will join with Tokyo Broadcasting System to
share the financial burden of gathering news overseas.
   Under the agreement announced Thursday, the two companies also
will study the possibility of co-producing sports and entertainment
programming, although no joint projects in those areas are
imminent, said James A. Warner, president of CBS marketing arm, CBS
Enterprises.
   The agreement is effective in April, he said.
   John Frazee, CBS News' vice president for news services, said
the agreement isn't necessarily a prelude to a larger operation
that might eventually try to compete globally with the 24-hour
Cable News Network.
   CNN, started in 1980, is seen in 95 countries.
   ``I'll just say that anything is possible and we are looking at
all kinds of possibilities'' with the Japanese network, Frazee
said. ``We'll consider anything.''
   CBS and Tokyo Broadcasting have cooperated with each other on
news coverage for 30 years and share office space in New York,
Tokyo and Johannesburg.
   The two will have access to each other's worldwide news reports
and programs, with TBS getting exclusive rights to air in Japan all
CBS News reports and such programs as ``60 Minutes.''
   CBS News once provided news to the rival NHK network, but that
arrangement ended two years ago, Frazee said. CBS still services
several Japanese broadcast companies but will stop when the
exclusive agreement with Tokyo Broadcasting begins, Warner said.
   Tokyo Broadcasting and CBS News plan to share office space in
more overseas cities, possibly starting with a Berlin office that
also would be shared with CNN, Frazee said.
   Save for ``tentative'' plans for Berlin, no decisions had been
made on other cities for the sharing of news, Frazee said.
   CBS News had been the only one of the three major U.S. networks
without an overseas partner in sharing newsgathering costs.
   NBC News bought a 37.5 percent interest in Visnews, a
London-based video news service. ABC News has a 45 percent interest
in a similar agency in London, Worldwide Television News, which CBS
also subscribes to.
   CBS News will continue as a subscriber to Worldwide Television,
Frazee said.

   A two-hour ride on the back of an
elephant has changed the life of a Swiss tourist. That night she
married the elephant keeper, official radio reported.
   Radio Thailand said Anouk Tschabold, 22, was smitten with the
elephant keeper, or mahout, during a recent jungle ride in the
northern province of Chiang Rai.
   Ms. Tschabold was initially impressed by the politeness of
Su-rang Ner-pae, also 22. Love blossomed as the ride progressed
against a backdrop of mountains, the radio said.
   That night they were married in a traditional Karen ceremony.
Her husband is a member of this ethnic minority famed for its
ability to catch, train and ride elephants.
   The broadcast, a transcript of which was made available today,
said the Swiss bride from Lausanne planned to give up her job in
the computer field and live in Thailand.

   The government has granted quotas for
the harvesting of 19,400 seals this year and 256 seals were killed
last week off the country's coast, an official says.
   Dr. Jan Jurgens, the director of sea fisheries, told the
independent South African Press Association that permit holders at
Cape Cross in the north and Luderitz in the south received the
quotas last Friday.
   He said Wednesday that 256 seals were harvested last Friday and
Saturday, the first two days of a season that lasts until November
15.
   A South African environmental group claimed 17,000 seals already
had been culled at Cape Cross since last Friday, SAPA reported.
   SAPA said Cape Cross has a seal population of about 200,000,
while Luderitz has about 250,000.
   In July, South Africa suspended plans to kill 30,000 seals after
protests from environmentalists. The seals were to be used for dog
food and aphrodisiacs.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush, who has been reading stories to
her own children and grandchildren for years, reaches out to a
wider audience this weekend with a nationally broadcast radio
series.
   Borrowing a page from former New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia,
the first lady will be reading children's stories over the ABC
radio network in a weekly series called ``Mrs. Bush's Story Time.''
   She'll also be offering tips in her 10 half-hour broadcasts to
parents on reading aloud to children. It's all part of her family
literacy campaign.
   Unlike New York's Depression-era mayor, who broadcast the comics
during a newspaper strike, Mrs. Bush is eschewing the funny pages
and sticking with children's literature.
   But she will get an assist from the cartoon world.
   Mrs. Bush will be reading her stories to such familiar
characters as Winnie the Pooh, Garfield, Bugs Bunny, Roger Rabbit,
Mickey and Minnie Mouse and Big Bird, done by their usual cartoon
voices.
   ``I'm not a comic reader,'' snipped Mrs. Bush.
   ``What we're trying to do is encourage families to read to their
children and take them to libraries,'' she explained in an
interview.
   ``We're going to tell them how to stop and talk and how to
explain words'' the kids don't understand, she said.
   ``Mrs. Bush's Story Time'' is a joint project of ABC's Project
Literacy U.S. and the Philadelphia-based Children's Literacy
Initiative.
   Jim Farley, executive producer of the series, calls it ``a
radical departure'' for commercial radio.
   ``American commercial radio stations don't program to kids,'' he
said. ``They don't let kids fill out (ratings) diaries, so they
don't count in the ratings.''
   For children listening to the first lady's broadcasts, ``radio
won't be a jukebox, it will be a source of both entertainment and
stimulation,'' the producer said.
   Mrs. Bush taped the broadcasts in two sittings at ABC's
Washington studios earlier this summer. The cartoon voices were
dubbed in later.
   ``This is an experienced storyteller,'' said Farley. ``She was
terrific.''
   The line up of stories include ``Ira Sleeps Over,'' ``Sylvester
and the Magic Pebble,'' ``The Story of Ferdinand,'' ``The Three
Billy Goats Gruff'' and ``Frog and Toad Together.'' Farley said the
stories are intended to hold the interest of children from ages 3
to 10.
   Mrs. Bush interrupts her own storytelling to ask her listeners
open-ended questions, and each week she offers a reading tip for
parents. Each broadcast ends with such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey
and Bette Midler talking about how reading affected their lives.
   More than 100 radio stations have signed up to air the weekly
broadcasts at various times starting this Saturday and Sunday.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is making
it easier for families and friends to reach out and touch U.S.
military personnel stationed in the Middle East.
   The company said Thursday that beginning Sept. 21 it will
provide free facsimile service at its 400 phone sales centers in
the United States for messages to the more than 100,000 troops
taking part in Operation Desert Shield.
   MCI Communications Corp. also was considering a range of
services to families, including facsimile and electronic mail,
perhaps through personal computers, said Jerry Edgerton, MCI vice
president for government systems.
   US Sprint spokesman Jim Crawford said his company was
considering installing more phone lines, electronic mail service or
videoconferencing to the Middle East.
   AT&amp;T's ``Desert Fax'' service resulted from a request from Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who also asked MCI and Sprint to provide
similar services to the troops.
   ``If we're using 20th century weapons, we also should be using
20th century communications,'' Cranston said in a statement. He
said a facsimile service would provide a big boost to morale for
U.S. forces participating in Operation Desert Shield.
   AT&amp;T said the duration of Desert Fax ``will depend on several
factors, including cost, volume of messages and benefits to
military personnel and their families.''
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said it normally would cost someone
$3.46 to use the same facsimile service to transmit a page to the
Middle East. He added that AT&amp;T had installed 25 facsimile machines
at an undisclosed location in the Middle East to handle the
messages.
   A facsimile or ``fax'' machine takes a printed page and
translates it into electronic signals that are sent through the
phone network and reprinted by a distant facsimile machine.
   AT&amp;T said military postal service personnel will deliver the
messages at regular mail calls in the Middle East, where U.S.
troops were posted following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Senders must fill out forms with a message, the name of a person
stationed in the Middle East and an APO or FPO address. AT&amp;T said
it cannot accept messages without proper APO or FPO addresses.
   The addresses of AT&amp;T Phone Centers may be obtained by calling
1-800-555-8111.

   For Soviet historian Robert Ivanov, no setting
is more appropriate than Kansas for a summit next month of citizens
of the world's two most powerful nations.
   Ivanov, an American history scholar in Moscow, said Thursday
it's ``tremendously important'' that the gathering coincide with
celebrations in Kansas of the centennial of President Dwight
Eisenhower's birth.
   ``The first attempts to improve our relations was during
Eisenhower's presidency,'' Ivanov said at a news conference at the
Soviet embassy to announce details of the ``Meeting For Peace.''
   More than 250 Soviets and an equal number of Americans will meet
Oct. 12-18 in Lawrence, Kan.
   ``There's never been anything quite like this where several
hundred people from the Soviet Union have descended upon one state,
coming in peace as they are,'' said Bob Swan of Lawrence, the U.S.
co-chairman of the event.
   The Soviets, from all 15 republics and a cross-section of
society, will live with American families and participate in events
in Lawrence and six other cities across the state.
   ``We have an opportunity to really celebrate this new era of
peace and cooperation,'' said Swan.
   The gathering occurs during the commemoration of the 100th
anniversary of Eisenhower's birthday, Oct. 14, 1890. A Soviet-U.S.
group will attend a special ceremony on Oct. 13 in Abilene, Kan.,
Eisenhower's boyhood home.
   Ivanov, who has published a biography of Eisenhower, said the
former president was ``tremendously popular'' in the Soviet Union
because of his military leadership during World War II, when the
U.S. and Soviets were allies.
   ``Eisenhower was ahead of his time'' in trying to improve
U.S.-Soviet relations, said Ivanov, citing Eisenhower's ``open
skies'' proposal to permit air inspection of each country's
military bases. It was during Eisenhower's administration in 1959
that Nikita Khrushchev visited the United States and conferred with
the president at Camp David, Md.
   Ivanov said Khrushchev's son, Sergei, will attend the conference
and John Eisenhower had been invited.
   ``Two sons of two presidents, we hope, will meet in Kansas,''
said Ivanov.
   U.S. and Soviet specialists in a variety of fields will hold
special workshops to exchange information on issues such as
business, trade, agriculture, medical care, energy and the
environment. Former President Ford is to speak at one event.
   Organizers said they hope the sessions produce ``concrete
results,'' such as ways to increase business deals between the two
countries.
   ``Our task is not only to meet, to talk about peace, friendship
and mutual understanding,'' said Ivanov.
   ``Our relations today, after the end of the Cold War, they
should not depend on President (Mikhail) Gorbachev and on President
Bush. Presidents ... come, then go. But people stay and it's our
task to put under these new Soviet-American relations, a
people-to-people diplomacy system.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dale Bumpers says he can't fathom why the
federal government would sell mineral-rich lands at terms enacted
by Ulysses S. Grant.
   So the Arkansas Democrat is sponsoring legislation that would
levy an 8 percent royalty and raise the fees charged on lands
obtained from the federal government for mining ``hardrock''
minerals such as gold, silver, copper or iron.
   The 118-year-old law, signed into law when Grant was president,
allows miners outright ownership of land for a fee of $2.50 to $5
an acre - the approximate price of land in 1872 - if they prove
they've found a valuable deposit and performed $500 worth of work
there.
   ``I don't understand why this particular industry ... ought to
just have a bird nest on the ground,'' Bumpers said Thursday at a
hearing of a Senate Energy and Commerce subcommittee. ``There isn't
a state in the nation that would permit this.''
   The government already gets royalties from oil, gas and coal
leases, he noted.
   The Bush administration, however, joined representatives of
mining companies in opposing Bumpers' proposal.
   Royalties could make it economically unfeasible to risk
developing mineral deposits on public lands, said Cy Jamison,
director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management.
   Stephen Alfers, a Denver attorney who analyzed Bumpers'
legislation at the Senate committee's request, said the proposal
``would have a devastating impact on the U.S. mining industry.''
   Smaller miners will ``have no future, many mines will close,
construction of new mines will decline precipitously, exploration
and discovery of new deposits will decline, and mining activity
will concentrate on private lands and in foreign countries,''
Alfers said.
   An 8 percent royalty on gross proceeds would consume nearly half
the typical mining company's profit, said Alfers, who represents
landowners and mining companies who develop minerals on public and
private lands.
   The proposed royalty would raise $300 million a year for federal
and state governments, Bumpers said. The Bureau of Land Management
estimates that $3.9 billion in minerals are mined from public lands
each year, he said.
   Since 1970, the federal government has sold land worth up to $47
million for just $4,500, according to a recent General Accounting
Office study.

   A divorced couple must jointly decide
what to do with seven frozen embryos, a Tennessee appeals court has
ruled, overturning a landmark decision that granted custody to the
woman.
   Charles Clifford, the lawyer for Junior Lewis Davis, declared
the Thursday ruling ``a complete vindication'' and said it could
lead to a settlement in the case.
   Kurt Erlenbach, who represents Davis' former wife, Mary Sue
Davis Stowe, said the decision may be just another step in the
legal battle over the embryos - the only disputed issue in the
couple's divorce.
   ``I am very disappointed. Mary is quite upset,'' Erlenbach said.
   ``My guess is that we are going to appeal, that we are going to
ask the (Tennessee) Supreme Court to hear it,'' he said.
   Erlenbach doubted that Davis and Mrs. Stowe can resolve the
future of the embryos, which were produced in vitro in December
1988 using his sperm and her eggs.
   Neither Mrs. Stowe, who lives in Titusville, Fla., or Davis,
from Maryville, would comment Thursday. Both have remarried.
   In February 1989, Davis sued his wife for divorce, asking a
court to prevent any use of the embryos without his consent. Davis
argued he should not be forced to become a parent against his
wishes.
   Circuit Judge W. Dale Young called the embryos ``children in
vitro'' and ruled in September 1989 that life begins at conception
and the embryos deserved protection under the law. He awarded
custody to Mrs. Stowe.
   The Tennessee Court of Appeals sent the case back to Young to
enter a judgment giving Mrs. Stowe and Davis ``joint control of the
fertilized ova (and) equal voice over their disposition.''
   ``It would be repugnant and offensive to constitutional
principals to order Mary Sue to implant these fertilized ova
against her will,'' Judge Herschel P. Franks wrote for the
three-member court.
   ``It would be equally repugnant to order Junior to bear the
psychological, if not the legal, consequences of paternity against
his will,'' the opinion said.
   Davis has said he wanted an equal role in deciding what to do
with the embryos, but never stated what that role would be.
   Mrs. Stowe initially said she wanted the embryos because they
were possibly her last chance to give birth. Later, she said she
wanted to donate them anonymously to a childless couple, a move
opposed by Davis.
   The appeals court did not consider the issue of whether the
embryos are alive and deserving of legal protection.

   President Bush wants Congress to provide an
additional $1.8 billion to cover the unexpected costs of Operation
Desert Shield through the end of this month, administration and
congressional sources say.
   Bush will formally ask Congress today for the money in an
emergency spending package that also includes a request to forgive
$7 billion in past military debt owed the United States by Egypt,
said the sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   The request also includes a proposal to transfer $900 million
for the Persian Gulf deployment from unused accounts within the
Pentagon to make up the rest of the $2.7 billion additional costs
incurred in the operation, the sources said.
   The 1990 fiscal year ends Sept. 30, and the White House hopes
that paying some of Operation Desert Shield's bills in the current
year will ease pressure at least slightly as the administration and
Congress draft a Defense Department budget for 1991, according to
the sources.
   ``We want to get it up and done so there's not that budget
impact,'' said an administration official.
   And the debt forgiveness for Egypt is included in hopes that
pairing it with the military money will make it easier for
lawmakers, always wary of foreign aid, to support, said one
administration official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``There's a lot of head scratching over how we are gonna pull
this off 30 days before an election,'' a source said.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, in visits to key
members of the House and Senate on Wednesday, argued that the debt
forgiveness for Egypt is necessary to reward an ally that has taken
a leadership role in rallying the Arab world against Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   In the private meetings, Eagleburger has made the case that aid
to Egypt bolsters a moderate Arab state and helps to stem the
rising tide of Moslem fundamentalism in the Middle East. Egypt has
been the linchpin of U.S. efforts to mount a broad international
response to the invasion, Eagleburger argued.
   But while many lawmakers agree Egypt is worthy of a reward, they
wince at the size of the debt forgiveness and worry that other U.S.
aid recipients will line up for similar largesse at a time when the
budget can ill afford it.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he has asked the administration
for a better idea of how much the debt forgiveness will cost the
United States in lost repayments each year.
   ``Egypt should be helped,'' said Leahy, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations foreign aid subcommittee. ``They do have their neck
out about as far as you can get. But there's going to be a need to
help a lot of people.''
   Leahy said he would like to handle it all at once instead of
piecemeal, and with a full picture of the costs involved.

   Carol Peiffer is a ``bovimaniac'' with a
mission.
   She collects cow figures, cow dolls, paintings of cows and other
bovine memorabilia. And she writes a cow quarterly.
   The art teacher mailed the first issue of ``Moosletter'' a year
ago to six fellow enthusiasts. Next month, she plans to send the
35-page fifth edition to about 100 subscribers.
   Peiffer, 45, said she has been collecting cow memorabilia for
years, but isn't sure what started it all.
   ``It's just that one day some time ago - I don't even remember
the date - I bought a knick-knack with a cow on it for the home,''
she said. ``When people came in, they loved it. And it dawned on me
that cows were serene and kind, and then I started my hobby.''
   When Peiffer met others who liked cow collectibles, she hit on
the idea of a forum to exchange information.
   The newsletter includes the light-hearted and the serious.
   For the upcoming issue, Marcie Leitzke of Gresham, Wis.,
contributed a short story, ``Down the Lane,'' about growing up on a
farm with a cow named Beulah.
   Ken Kephert, with Pennsylvania State's cooperative extension
service, contributed an article about the animal rights movement.
   ``We don't take any side on any issue,'' Peiffer said. ``The
Moosletter was started as a pleasant, good-humored newsletter and I
want to keep it that way.''

   It was a historic moment the other day when
representatives of the four victorious World War II powers, meeting
in Moscow, took the steps that will permit Germany to become a
sovereign reunified state.
   Too bad they couldn't savor the moment more than they did. The
perils of the Persian Gulf crisis were perceived to be too great
for more than a perfunctory celebration.
   Just hours before the ceremony, President Bush spoke to Congress
and the American people in a formal setting for the first time
about the crisis.
   The close timing of the two events symbolized the transition
from the ideological conflict of the Cold War to the new and
different type of struggle that the gulf conflict represents, at
the heart of which is economics.
   In some ways, the East-West conflict was easier for Americans to
swallow. After all, the survival of democracy was at stake in the
U.S. commitment to the defense of European and other partners. In
the gulf, the issue is somewhat less majestic: the survival of
cheap oil.
   The administration, not without cause, has been saying that high
principles are at stake in the gulf. Few dispute the contention of
Bush and most other world leaders that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein violated international law when he devoured Kuwait six
weeks ago.
   But the episode showed once again how selective governments can
be in deciding when to be indignant. How many governments would
have lifted a finger in Kuwait's defense if it were not sitting
atop a huge pool of oil?
   Indonesia did much the same to East Timor in 1975 that Iraq did
to Kuwait this summer. The Timorese found themselves invaded one
day and annexed the next. International protests were limited
largely to human rights groups. The fuss was contained because too
many countries prized their relationship with Indonesia - an oil
country, by the way.
   Americans feel more comfortable about defending democracy, but
they don't have that luxury in the gulf crisis. The Kuwaiti
leadership, by Western standards, was more benign than rulers
elsewhere in the region, but no one has ever detected a
Jeffersonian streak in them.
   But as Secretary of State James A. Baker III sees it, the stakes
in the gulf are too high to allow moralistic concerns about
multi-party democracy to transcend other interests.
   The issue, he said last week, is not just a narrow question of
the flow of oil from Kuwait and Iraq.
   ``It is about a dictator who, acting alone and unchallenged,
could strangle the global economic order, determining by fiat
whether we all enter a recession, or even the darkness of a
depression,'' Baker said.
   The administration's defense of Kuwait has taken it to some
strange addresses. One example is Damascus, where Baker spent
several hours Thursday conferring with Syrian officials.
   There may be three or four countries in the world that
administration officials find more disreputable than Syria, which
the United States accuses of engaging in state-sponsored terrorism.
But on the narrow issue of the Persian Gulf crisis, the two nations
happen to agree and to need each other.
   In times of world tension, the United States has often entered
tactical alliances with dictators it would shun under ordinary
circumstances.
   In the name of anti-communism, successive administrations cozied
up to rightist strongmen from all continents. They did so because
the perceived alternative - allowing a Marxist group to take power
- was too perilous to contemplate.
   With the decline of communism, the United States can feel
comfortable about loosening ties with countries whose only
perceived virtue is opposition to Marxism.
   But with the rise of Saddam, the administration is ready to make
common cause with just about anyone who shares the U.S. concern
about leaving him unchecked. Saddam at this point is about as
isolated as he can be, but the question lingers: Will the gulf
crisis end as benignly as the Cold War did?

<HEAD>U.S. Tobacco Companies to Supply Cigarettes to Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. tobacco giants have leapt to the rescue
of Soviet smokers fuming over their worst cigarette shortage in
decades.
   Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco said Thursday they will
supply billions of cigarettes to the Soviet Union, which has an
estimated 70 million smokers out of a population of 285 million.
   The financial details were not disclosed.
   The shipments could help ease a domestic crisis that has caused
unhappy smokers to protest in the streets of Moscow and Leningrad
this summer.
   The companies have been emphasizing sales to foreign countries
as the U.S. tobacco market gives ground to anti-smoking campaigns.
   Philip Morris said the order by the Russian republic, the
largest of the 15 Soviet republics, was the single biggest
cigarette export order in the company's history.
   Marlboro and other well-known Philip Morris brands will be part
of the order that will amount to more than 20 billion cigarettes by
the end of next year. Shipments by Philip Morris International
Inc., a division of New York-based Philip Morris Cos., will start
at the end of this month.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc., a Winston-Salem,
N.C.-based subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc., said it signed a
separate agreement to ship 14 billion cigarettes to the Soviet
Union.
   Delivery of Winston and other R.J. Reynolds brands is expected
to begin next month and conclude by September 1991, the company
said.
   Both companies said they will have continuing involvement with
the Soviet tobacco industry.
   Philip Morris said it has an agreement to supply additional
quantities of cigarettes to the Russian republic from 1992 to 1995.
Under another agreement, it will help Soviet agencies develop their
domestic cigarette industry.
   Similarly, R.J. Reynolds noted that it previously announced it
would participate in a joint venture operation with the Uritsky
cigarette factory in Leningrad.
   ``The Soviet Union is the third-largest cigarette market in the
world, and we are pleased to help satisfy Russian consumer's
pent-up demand,'' said Aleardo G. Buzzi, president and chief
executive of Philip Morris International.
   John Dollisson, a vice president at Philip Morris, said the
company will be paid in hard currency and in counter trade items,
which he declined to specify.
   He said Philip Morris had been in negotiations for ``quite some
time to get our products into the Soviet Union.''
   The U.S. cigarettes sold in the Soviet Union are expected to be
priced at a premium to the domestically made brands. Currently,
American cigarettes are sold on a limited basis in that country,
with sales restricted to duty-free outlets and stores that accept
only hard currency.
   The shortage of cigarettes became so severe in the Soviet Union
this summer that rationing was imposed in Moscow, where jars of
used butts were being sold on street corners for as much as $16.

<HEAD>Administration: Tougher Pollution Standards Will Cut Oil
Consumption</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tougher pollution controls will not only clean
the air but help America ease its dependence on foreign oil, the
administration says in trying to head off criticism of
anti-pollution bills in Congress because of the oil crisis.
   The Environmental Protection Agency sought Thursday to highlight
the oil-saving potential of the clean air bill by releasing a study
that estimated as much as 1 million barrels of oil a day could be
saved if the legislation becomes law.
   The study said the savings would come from utilities shifting
from oil to natural gas to comply with acid rain pollution
controls, and the use of cleaner gasoline blends that contain
non-petroleum additives such as ethanol. Much of the savings would
come toward the end of the decade.
   The EPA issued the report as some members of Congress began
questioning the wisdom of new and expensive pollution controls at a
time of vaulting energy costs.
   House and Senate negotiators for weeks have been engaged in
intense discussions to try to work out a final clean air bill
before Congress adjourns next month.
   The conference committee members were scheduled to meet today to
give final approval to a section of the bill requiring new
industrial smog controls and several other provisions.
   But broad sections of the legislation, including those covering
new emission controls on automobiles, requirements for cleaner
motor fuels in the most smog-ridden cities, and curbs on acid rain
have yet to be agreed upon.
   The legislation is expected to cost industry as much as $25
billion a year by the end of the decade when all requirements
become effective.
   Opponents of the bill and industry lobbyists trying to thwart
various sections of it, have argued that such expensive controls
are ill timed when energy prices are soaring with the potential of
energy shortages in the months ahead.
   But EPA Administrator William Reilly said Thursday the
legislation is even more needed now.
   ``I think the energy implications ... make it more urgently
necessary than ever for Congress to pass the bill,'' said Reilly in
a telephone interview. ``The total (savings) of 800,000 to 1
million barrels a day exceeds the total oil imports from Kuwait and
Iraq.''
   According to the EPA study, between 300,000 and 500,000 barrels
of oil a day could be saved by the end of the decade if utilities
switch from sulfur-containing oil to natural gas to comply with
requirements for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions. The emissions
cause acid rain.
   Another 500,000 barrels of oil a day could be saved because oil
companies will have to sell cleaner fuels or gasoline blends that
contain 15 percent or more of non-petroleum additives, the study
said. Requirements for wider use of vehicles that use fuels other
than gasoline also is expected to cut into oil demand, the study
said.

   Woody Woodpecker, the perky cartoon character
known for his staccato laugh and shenanigans, was honored on his
50th birthday with a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.
   About 150 schoolchildren sang ``Happy Birthday'' at a ceremony
Thursday.
   ``Woody is 50 and I'm 90,'' said Walter Lantz, who created Woody
in 1940 and has his own star on the Walk of Fame. ``Pretty good for
a couple of old birds, isn't it?''
   The meddlesome, red-and-blue bird has appeared in 200 cartoons
in 35 languages and 17 million comic books.
   Lantz said he created Woody after a bird destroyed the roof of
his mountain cabin.
   ``Every morning this woodpecker would be going at my roof. ... I
finally had to replace the entire roof, but he's repaid me over the
years,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bill Would Give Defense Department Control Over Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has endorsed legislation through
which the Defense Department would gain greater authority to block
technology exports by U.S. companies to Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria
for national security reasons.
   Senate approval of the legislation came Thursday on a voice
vote. Its adoption came as it was learned that the Commerce
Department, despite Pentagon objections, last February approved the
exporting to Iraq of digital image-enhancing equipment made by
California company.
   ``Clearly, that device is going to be used against our forces;
there's no denying it,'' said Stephen Bryen, a former deputy
assistant defense secretary for trade policy.
   The Pentagon already has national security controls over exports
to a group of primarily communist bloc countries but now can only
advise the Commerce and State departments on export licenses for
the four Arab nations targeted in the legislation.
   A provision expanding the Defense Department's authority was
added by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to a bill generally loosening
restrictions on the sale of U.S. computers, telecommunications
equipment and machine tools to newly democratizing countries in
Eastern Europe.
   Helms cited the Commerce Department's approval in February 1989
of selling two furnaces to Iraq even though the manufacturer
acknowledged they could be used to make nuclear fuel rods for an
atomic weapons reactor.
   That sale was stopped just before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait when the Pentagon appealed to President Bush after Commerce
officials had refused to allow the Defense Department to review the
manufacturer's export license request.
   ``We have this situation where the Defense Department says
`don't do that' but is overruled by the Commerce Department,''
Helms said. ``This has occurred over and over and over again.''
   Also as part of the bill, the Senate approved a measure by Sen.
Richard Shelby, D-Ala., raising civil and criminal fines for
violating President Bush's embargo against Iraq from $10,000 and
$50,000, respectively, to $250,000 and $1 million.
   The bill now goes to a conference with negotiators from the
House, which - at the behest of U.S. manufacturers losing out to
Japan, South Korea and Europe on export sales - voted in June to
ease the restrictions even more.
   ``In the United States it takes a business 114 days on average
to get an export license,'' complained Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
whose state is home to several high technology manufacturers.
   ``In Germany, it takes just 14 days and in Japan only four
days,'' Kerry said. ``Therein lies a great deal of the story why
the United States is struggling in the world marketplace.''
   The legislation reauthorizes the Export Administration Act
giving the president authority to restrict exports and the U.S.
participation in the 17-nation Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Security Controls (COCOM).
   COCOM is a Cold War-era multinational agency that jointly
determines which high-tech goods are too militarily sensitive to be
sold to potential enemies. In June, it agreed to greatly reduce
restrictions on sales of computers and other technology to former
Iron Curtain countries in Eastern Europe.
   Meanwhile, a company stuck with four multimillion-dollar
furnaces that the Bush administration first approved and then
disapproved for shipment to Iraq filed a $62 million suit Thursday
against Saddam Hussein's government.
   The federal court suit by Consarc Corp. claims that Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait and Iraqi deception over how the
high-temperature furnaces would be used resulted in losses for the
industrial furnace builder and its sister company in Scotland.
   Consarc, of Rancocas, N.J., cited U.S. assertions that the
equipment could help give Iraq the ability to make nuclear weapons.
Two of the furnaces were to be shipped from the United States and
two others from Scotland.

<HEAD>DiPrete Proposes Campaign Reforms - After November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete is proposing a
wide-ranging campaign and ethics reforms.
   Diprete, a Republican, promised Thursday to ask the
Democrat-dominated General Assembly to ban campaign contributions
from state or municipal contractors and from corporations or labor
unions. He would cut maximum donations from others to $1,000.
   DiPrete's campaign finance reports detail contributions similar
to the ones he wants to outlaw. But he refused to return that money
``because I feel the candidates should be on a level playing field
for 1990. We can't change the rules retroactively.''
   He also proposed limiting campaign donations from political
parties and barring candidates from keeping surplus funds.
   In addition, DiPrete wants to bar candidates from making loans
to their campaigns. Democratic opponent Bruce G. Sundlun is a
millionaire who has self-financed most of the three campaigns he
has run against DiPrete in six years.
   DiPrete's voter approval ratings have dropped to around 20
percent as the state's economy has faltered. Surveys show likely
voters choosing Sundlun more because they dislike DiPrete and want
a change.

   Sen. Larry Pressler and his Democratic
opponent, Ted Muenster, both enjoyed six-figure incomes last year,
according to their tax returns.
   Press, R-S.D., and his wife, Harriet, reported $154,020 in
income last year and paid $29,906 in federal taxes.
   Muenster, a Sioux Falls businessman, and his wife, Karen, made
$112,000 and paid $20,848 in federal taxes, according to their 1989
return.
   Pressler released his returns for the past 10 years late
Thursday afternoon after Muenster gave his 1989 forms to the media.
Pressler had challenged Muenster to release returns for the past
decade.
   Democrats have tried to paint Pressler as a high-living
incumbent who has lost touch with his constituents since going to
Washington.
   The Presslers' 1989 income included the senator's $89,500
salary, $49,028 in speaking fees, and $15,180 that Mrs. Pressler

<HEAD>Wilson Takes Campaign to Hispanics, Feinstein Looks At Housing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pete Wilson courted Hispanic voters by
promising to consider seriously Hispanics for appointments if he is
elected governor, while Dianne Feinstein unveiled an affordable
housing plan.
   Though Wilson made no promises of specific appointments
Thursday, he pointed to his record as proof of his commitment to
minority appointments. He noted that as a U.S. senator he had
nominated women, blacks and Hispanics as federal judges.
   But Wilson remained firm in his opposition to hiring quotas, an
idea the senator says his Democratic opponent once endorsed.
Feinstein says she never wanted quotas, contending her views on
hiring goals were misunderstood.
   In San Francisco, Feinstein outlined policies she said would
``make the dream of owning your own home possible for more
Californians.''
   The former San Francisco mayor said that as governor she would
immediately tap $600 million in voter-approved bonds to build
affordable housing, 90 percent of which she said remain unspent.
That percentage was disputed by state officials.
   Actually, the state Department of Housing and Community
Development has spent $151.9 million of the money after a delay
caused by drafting regulations and hiring staff, said department
spokeswoman Kathie Parrish.
   Another $200 million is expected to be spent by year's end and
most of the money should be allocated by 1992, said Parrish.

   A 63-year-old woman collapsed and died in a
waiting area at D.C. General Hospital after being all but ignored
by hospital staff members, relatives say.
   ``No hospital personnel ever touched my mother, not until after
she was dead,'' Carolyn Evans told The Washington Post.
   Patricia Jones of Washington waited about three hours for
treatment after walking into the emergency room Monday night with
several family members. She had complained of chest pains and
shortness of breath, Evans said Thursday.
   Mark Chastang, D.C. General's executive director, said in a
statement that officials are investigating the death. He also
offered his sympathy to the family. The hospital declined further
comment.
   Jones, who suffered from hypertension, walked into the hospital
waiting room, got into a wheelchair and registered, Evans said.
   During the wait, Jones said she was feeling faint and asked to
be taken to the bathroom, Evans said. Watson ran to the admissions
desk to alert personnel about her mother's condition.
   ``My sister turned back and looked at my mother and saw that she
was turning blue,'' Evans said.
   By this time, several other people in the waiting area, also
noticing Jones' condition, began to yell for attention, Evans said.
   ``Finally someone came out,'' Evans said. ``But she just stood
there looking at my mother.''
   Jones was taken into the emergency room a short while later,
after family members and others in the waiting room placed her on a
gurney, Evans said.
   Evans said the family at first was told that Jones died from
hypertension, but the death later was attributed to a blood clot in
her lungs.
   D.C. General had more than 81,000 emergency room visits last
year, an average of about 220 a day.

   High school teacher Tom Sutton wants to show
tapes of David Souter's Supreme Court confirmation hearings to his
personal-law class.
   He says Souter gives hometown flesh to the abstractions of
justice.
   ``Here's the highest court in the land and we've got someone who
is maybe going to be there,'' Sutton said. ``It's creating a lot of
local interest in the man, but it's creating interest in the
position as well.''
   Souter, 50, answered questions Thursday during the first day of
hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He spoke about his life
in this small New Hampshire town as neighbors watched with pride
and affection.
   Janet Brown, a childhood friend, said she wasn't surprised that
Souter brought up the town of 4,500 people during his opening
remarks.
   ``He's a very caring person, warm to everyone,'' Brown said.
``He's what we were all brought up to believe in.''
   Souter said Weare bred a closeness among people ``unattainable
anywhere else'' and added, ``We were aware of lives that were easy
and we were aware of lives that were very hard.''
   Marian Setterlund, who owns Cinder's Country Store, also praised
Souter.
   ``He's apolitical, he's an honest man and he stays to himself,''
she said.
   Others in Weare agreed.
   ``I don't think he can do wrong in any way as far as the people
in the town are concerned,'' Selectman Bill Herman said.
   Each of Weare's selectmen urged the Judiciary Committee to
confirm Souter's nomination.
   Souter's mother, Helen, thought he looked exhausted on the
hearing's opening day and noticed his 5 o'clock shadow.
   ``He has a very heavy beard. He's meticulous about shaving, but
that he can't help,'' she said.
   Souter lived with his mother in their weatherbeaten Weare
farmhouse until she moved into a retirement residence in Concord
several years ago. Souter still lives in the farmhouse and visits
his mother every Sunday.
   Brown said that the respectful way the senators treated Souter
renewed her patriotism. She said watching the hearings was like
watching America at work.
   ``I'm impressed with the whole system. America can sleep better
knowing someone with his integrity has the opportunity to be
there,'' she said.

   During the test last year, Iraq fired a missile loaded with a
chemical warfare agent, the Los Angeles Times said, quoting Arab
and U.S. officials it did not identify by name.
   The test in northwestern Iraq shows that the government of
Saddam Hussein can carry out a chemical weapons attack using
missiles with a range of 175 to nearly 600 miles, the newspaper
said.
   Such missiles could reach U.S. forces deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   No country has ever launched a missile attack with chemical
weapons. Iraq combined the two after its war with Iran ended in
1988.
   Officials say such an attack would be far more difficult for
Iraq than waging chemical war with conventional aircraft.
   ``It is an extremely complicated and difficult operation,'' said
Geoffrey Kemp, a former National Security Council staff member.
``It requires that you have a mechanism that releases the gas at
the right altitude as the missile is re-entering the atmosphere.''
   Because missiles can travel farther and faster than aircraft and
are more difficult to intercept, the test is seen as a serious
threat.
   In response, the United States has deployed Patriot
surface-to-air missiles to intercept Iraqi missiles, the newspaper
said. The U.S. plan is to intercept the missiles at high altitude
and disperse the gas before it reaches the ground, it said.
   Three types of Iraqi missiles are Soviet made and described by a
U.S. Air Force official as inaccurate.
   ``They could be useful against an area target, but not against a
high-value military target,'' he said.
   High-value military targets include radar installations and air
fields. An area target is a population center.
   Iraq used chemical warfare extensively in the eight-year war
with Iran and experts say that contributed to Iran's acceptance of
a United Nations settlement in 1988. Officials say American troops
are well trained in chemical warfare.

<HEAD>State Department Says Romania Complying with Embargo After All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania is complying with United Nations
sanctions and has not imported oil from Iraq, the State Department
says, contradicting its own internal study.
   An unclassified State Department report on compliance with the
sanctions said that Romania ``expects to receive oil indirectly
from Iraq.'' The report was completed last Friday and the
Associated Press carried a story based on the study on Tusday.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday, ``There is
no truth to reports that the State Department believes Romania is
importing Iraqi oil, or otherwise violating the sanctions.
   ``In fact, Romania has been a strong supporter of the sanctions
from the outset, and has played a very positive role on a number of
issues relating to the Gulf crisis.''
   Boucher did not mention it, but Romania has offered to refine
oil for U.S. forces in the Middle East.
   Asked to elaborate on the discrepancy between the report and the
public statement, a State Department official said, ``Information
changes.'' He asked not to be identified and declined further
elaboration.
   The Cuban government also has denied a State Department
assertion in the report that Cuba had received oil from Iraq in
circumvention of the sanctions.
   Boucher said that although there is no firm evidence that Cuba
has violated the sanctions, Iraqi oil was delivered to the port of
Matanzas on Aug. 25.
   He said Cuba claims that this is not a violation because the
tanker was loaded and contracts signed prior to Aug. 6, when the
U.N. Security Council voted to embargo Iraq.
   ``We've expressed our concern to the government of Cuba and said
that as a Security Council member, Cuba should strictly abide by
the embargo,'' Boucher said.

   Barring the weird or the unexpected,
there is precious little in the yearly Emmy awards to titillate
television viewers, except for the usual stargazing fest.
   On paper, the 42nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards appear decidedly
unweird. But in the tradition of live television, anything can
happen during Sunday's 8 p.m. (EST-PST) telecast on the Fox
Broadcasting Co. in which ``Twin Peaks'' and ``L.A. Law'' were
expected to be the big winners.
   The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences still winces at past
embarrassments:
   -The 1978 broadcast, which was pre-empted for more than an hour
by a press conference announcing the signing of the Camp David
accords between Israel and Egypt. The awards ceremony, which came
to a halt while the historic peace treaty was announced, eventually
resumed. Total elapsed time: 5 hours and 10 minutes, the longest
Emmy program in history;
   -The 1980 Screen Actor's Guild strike, which left the awards
show with no presenters, performers or trophy accepters. Although
SAG promised to not picket the ceremony, the union barred its
members from participating. Some ignored the order. Powers Boothe,
who won in the miniseries category that year for his portrayal of
People's Temple leader Jim Jones, was the only nominee who
attended;
   -The 1983 program, hosted by Joan Rivers and Eddie Murphy lit up
NBC switchboards across the country. First, Rivers called
then-Secretary of the Interior James Watt an ``idiot.'' Next, the
controversial comedian introduced ``Dynasty'' star Joan Collins,
saying the character played by Collins ``has had more hands up her
dress than the Muppets.''
   Walter Miller, director of this year's ceremony, thrives on such
unpredictable incidents.
   ``It's like life, you never know what's around the corner until
you turn it,'' said Miller, who has directed three other Emmy
programs, as well as 12 Grammy shows, four Tony Awards
presentations and 18 Country Music Awards.
   ``It tests my mettle everytime,'' Miller said. ``Every show,
something comes up.''
   This year's program is hosted by ``Murphy Brown'' star and
nominee Candice Bergen, NBC news personality Jane Pauley and
comedian and ``Tonight Show'' guest host Jay Leno.
   Emmy trophies in the creative arts categories were to be given
on Saturday night and broadcast Sept. 19 at 8 (EST-PST) in Los
Angeles and New York.
   Sunday night's ceremony, broadcast live to the East Coast from
the Pasadena Civic Auditorium and tape-delayed to Western states,
is dominated by nominations for the most bizarre show on
television.
   ABC's ``Twin Peaks'' captured a leading 14 nominations last
month. The surreal, nighttime soap opera about sex, violence,
murder and junk food in a Northwest lumber town captured selections
including outstanding drama series, led actor, lead actress, and
directing for eclectic film maker David Lynch.
   Kyle MacLachlan was nominated for his portrayal of
coffee-slurping, pie-guzzling FBI agent Dale Cooper. Piper Laurie
was selected for her performances as Catherine Martell, the
ruthless director of the Twin Peaks sawmill.
   NBC's ``L.A. Law'' finished second in the nominations race, with
13 selections including best drama series (which it won last year),
and three supporting dramatic actor recognitions for Richard
Dysart, Larry Drake and Jimmy Smits.
   Drake's poignant portrayal of the law firm's mentally retarded
messenger won him the trophy in the supporting actor category in
1988 and 1989.
   Sunday's three-hour telecast also will feature a montage tribute
to late Muppets creator Jim Henson, compiled from film and
television clips.
   The cast of ``In Living Color,'' Fox's risky comedy sketch show
featuring an almost all black troupe, also will perform. The
critically acclaimed half-hour program, created by Keenen Ivory
Wayans, is nominated for outstanding variety, music or comedy
series.

   Has this ever happened to you? You get
the family RV loaded for an outing. You manage to fit everything in
just right. Then you discover a pesky radio bracket is somewhere
you can't get to easily.
   What do you do?
   Well, if you're a member of the 265th Quartermaster Detachment,
you laugh some, mutter some, then unpack and repack the pickup
truck for what seems to be the 15th time.
   It's no big deal. The 14 men of the South Carolina National
Guard unit have time to kill as they wait for a plane to take them
to the Mideast.
   The latest word was that the water purification unit will leave
this weekend. There had been prior false alarms, but this time the
men treated the news seriously. Many of them stashed their families
at post guest quarters or in off-post motels advertising discount
rates for servicemen.
   Another indication that the men are short timers was a visit by
Maj. Gen. T. Eston Marchant, South Carolina's adjutant general.
   Marchant gave the unit the state flag with orders to fly it in
the Mideast and return it home safely.
   ``I'm counting on you,'' he said.
   Marchant also joked about the unit's reputation for card
playing. ``I want to know how long it will be before you have that
casino set up in the desert,'' he said.
   ``That would be Sgt. Cohen's job, sir,'' said Sgt. Ronnie
Jackson, the unit's commander.
   Sgt. Hullie Cohen, who plays long games of cards in the barracks
at night, smiled and nodded.
   Cohen, a former Air Force load handler, and the other men spent
the rest of the hot dusty day carfully loading and rearranging four
sand-colored Chevy Custom Deluxe four-wheel drives that will fly
over to the Mideast aboard the same plane as the men.
   Cohen showed how to segregate potentially dangerous materials,
like chemicals, flares, batteries and fire extinguishers into a
separate pile.
   ``If something happens in the plane, you just drop the ramp and
toss anything dangerous,'' he said.
   The slow-paced packing and repacking was supervised by Sgt.
Robert Martin, regular Army, sent to help the 265th prepare for
overseas. It was Martin who pointed out the misplaced radio
bracket.
   ``You know what they do to messengers who bring bad news don't
you, sergeant?'' asked Sgt. Earnest Deloach, a cigar clamped in his
mouth.
   ``I look at it as constructive criticism,'' Martin said as he
watched the work from his perch on a huge propane tank. ``I get my
butt chewed if this isn't done right. This just makes it harder for
me.''
   ``Yeah,'' said Spc. Ulysses Calhoun. ``I can see that you're
about to break into a sweat.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States admitted 107,000 refugees in
1989, the highest influx in a decade, the Department of Health and
Human Services says.
   Of the 107,000, 39,414 came from the Soviet Union, 37,066 from
Southeast Asia, 4,826 from Iran, 3,808 from Cuba, 1,745 from
Afghanistan and 1,724 from Ethiopia.
   Amerasians - children with a Vietnamese mother and American
father - comprised 8,721 of the total, HHS said.
   Since 1975, the United States has admitted more than 1.3 million
refugees, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said in an annual report to
Congress.
   ``I am proud that we are able to welcome these refugees to our
country and to assist them in their quest for self-sufficiency,''
Sullivan said in a statement.
   The 107,000 was an increase of 31,000 from 1988. It was the
largest number of refugees since 1981.
   Through English language and vocational training programs, more
than 24,000 refugees were placed in unsubsidized employment last
year, said Jo Anne B. Barnhart, HHS assistant secretary for family
support.
   ``These individuals and their families are now repaying this
country through their work efforts and their tax dollars,''
Barnhart said.
   HHS reimburses states for costs of providing cash and medical
assistance to refugees during their initial months in the United
States.

<HEAD>Panama Invasion Cost Nearly $164 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department estimates that the cost
of the U.S. invasion of Panama last December was about $163.6
million, a congressional report says.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found in a report released Thursday that the incremental
cost for Operation Just Cause was about $155 million for the Army,
$5.7 million for the Air Force and $2.9 million for the Navy.
   The invasion that began in the early morning hours Dec. 20, 1989
and lasted until Jan. 31 involved 27,000 U.S. troops, including
13,000 who were stationed in Panama.
   The objective of Operation Just Cause was to remove Panamanian
leader Manuel Noriega, who had been indicted in the United States
on drug charges.
   The GAO based its report on estimates from the military services
and did not independently verify the numbers.
   Among the costs associated with Operation Just Cause were
expenses incurred prior to the invasion, including practice
missions and the price of evacuating military dependents.
   Other expenses included replacing aircraft and vehicles lost
during the operation, the price of ammunition and allowances paid
to military personnel, including imminent danger pay and family
separation pay.
   The release of the costs associated with the Panama invasion
comes as the Bush administration is estimating that the U.S.
military buildup to deter Iraqi aggression could cost as much as
$15 billion in the next fiscal year.

<HEAD>Pentagon-Postal Service Disagree Over Free Mail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after the Postal Service offered to
deliver mail free from American military personnel in the Middle
East, the Pentagon said no.
   Military post offices collect the mail and then turn it over to
postal officials for delivery in this country.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank had said Wednesday that his
agency was prepared to accept and deliver mail, without stamps,
from personnel serving in Operation Desert Shield.
   But, on Thursday, the Defense Department said letters without
stamps cannot be accepted until Congress and President Bush approve
the action. The plan has passed the Senate and is pending in the
House.
   The House had appeared poised to approve the plan overwhelmingly
until Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., offered an amendment stipulating
that money to pay for the free mail would come from appropriations
for free franked mail by members of Congress.
   Ridge's proposal was rejected on a voice vote. He then demanded
a roll call vote, and because the House had already agreed to hold
no more recorded votes this week, the members postponed action
until next week.
   Pentagon spokesman Glen Flood said ``current law does not
authorize free mail for deployed forces in situations short of
hostilities. We hope the full Congress takes action soon, but as of
right now free mail is not authorized. We hope that changes.''
   Advised of the Pentagon decision, the Postal Service said that
its announcement of free mail from troops in Saudi Arabia ``was
made in the spirit and intent of proposed legislation.''
   ``The Postal Service stands ready to accept and deliver service
men and women's free mail when received,'' the agency said.

   A leukemia victim whose search for a perfect bone
marrow match swelled a registry of possible donors by 50,000 has
been released from a hospital after receiving marrow from her
mother.
   Allison Atlas, 20, of Bethesda, Md., was discharged from the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's bone marrow transplant
floor Thursday after spending 35 days isolated in a sterile
environment.
   It will be six months to a year before it is known if her immune
system has returned to normal.
   ``The bone marrow graft is well established and functioning
appropriately,'' said Dr. David Peace, one of Miss Atlas'
physicians. ``At this time, there is no evidence of recurrent
disease.''
   The transplant was conducted after her diseased marrow was
destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation. A nationwide search for a
perfectly matched marrow donor inspired 50,000 would-be
contributors, but none were suitable for her.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Friday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed lower.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed 177.62 points, or 0.71
percent, ending the day at 24,897.46 in moderate trading of 530
million shares in the first section. The index lost 141.06 points
Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 136.55 yen, down 1.10 yen from
Thursday's close of 137.65 yen. It opened at 136.35 yen and ranged
between 136.20 yen and 136.70 yen.
   ``Trading was mixed as many investors focused on cross tradings
involving the dollar, the yen and the German mark,'' said Minori
Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank.
   She said the dollar's weakness has become a firm trend due to
continuing pessimism over the U.S. economy.
   Other dealers said the dollar's weakness Friday followed its
overnight decline in New York, where investors were discouraged by
remarks by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan about the
possibility of relaxing monetary policy if the White House and
Congress reach a U.S. budget deficit reduction accord.
   Lower U.S. interest rates tend to make the dollar less
attractive to foreign investors.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed 192.34 points, or 0.77
percent, ending the morning session at 24,882.74. It lost 141.06
points Thursday.
   Traders attributed the index's decline to a weakness in the
Japanese government bond market and a 43.07-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average in New York.
   They said the Nikkei fell mainly due to a large-scale arbitrage
selling to take profits between the spot and the futures market.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond was higher at 8.400 percent from
Thursday's close 8.385-percent close. The price slipped to 81.86
points from 81.93.

   Warren Burger, former chief justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court, says the confirmation process for David Souter
should not involve asking him for commitments on how he would vote.
   ``Are the types of questions senators are posing to the latest
nominee subjecting him, and the court, to dangerous pressures from
elected officials, pressures which undermine the essential American
idea of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary?''
Burger asked in an article he wrote for the Sept. 16 issue of
Parade magazine.
   He continued: ``Now the question is whether the American people
are witnessing a confirmation process in which special-interest
groups have flooded senators with questions demanding advance
commitment from the nominee as to what his or her vote will be on
some pet subject.''
   ``To expect a nominee to make commitments, or even to engage in
substantive discussion of a case yet unseen, borders on the
preposterous,'' Burger said.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee began confirmation hearings for

<HEAD>Singer Mary Wells Stricken With Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Mary Wells, known for such 1960s hits
as ``My Guy'' and ``You Beat Me to the Punch,'' is destitute and
fighting throat cancer. Celebrity friends are helping her face the
struggle.
   ``People say this is a cruel business - and it is. But a lot of
people in the business do have hearts,'' said the 47-year-old
singer, whose voice is barely audible because of a recent
tracheotomy.
   The operation was performed last month after doctors found a
cancerous tumor on the two-pack-a-day smoker's larynx.
   ``I'm fighting for my life,'' she said in a recent interview
from a downtown hotel room where she lives.
   Miss Wells had been living comfortably with her 4-year-old
daughter in a three-bedroom townhouse in the San Fernando Valley,
but throat pain forced her to stop performing on the oldies circuit
and her savings dried up.
   While she was in the hospital last month, her landlord evicted
her for failing to pay her rent. Miss Wells has no health insurance
to cover her mounting medical bills.
   ``I found out about Mary's illness while she was still in the
hospital. I called everybody in the media I could think of to put
the word out that Mary needed financial help,'' said Joyce McRae,
co-trustee of an account set up by the philanthropic Rhythm and
Blues Foundation in Washington, D.C.
   As a foundation grant recipient, donations have helped Miss
Wells. Diana Ross gave $15,000, Rod Stewart and Bruce Springsteen
came up with $10,000 each, and the Temptations gave $5,000.
   ``She's doing quite well,'' foundation managing director Susan
Jenkins said Thursday from her Washington office. ``She is
undergoing radiation treatment several times a week.''
   The singer was under treatment at the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer
Hospital at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. The radiation
treatments, if successful, may allow her to avoid surgery to remove
her larynx.
   The 2-year-old foundation has designated the Carter and Turner
Management firm to administer the Mary Wells Fund. As of this week,
the fund has grown to $54,000, Jenkins said.
   A portion of the proceeds from the five-album ``Motor City Dance
Party,'' a medley of Motown hits, will be donated to help pay
medical expenses for Miss Wells, Quality Records president Russ
Regan said Thursday.
   As Motown's first successful individual singer, Miss Wells was
among a group of rhythm and blues artists, including the
Temptations, Supremes, Miracles and Marvelettes, who defined the
Motown sound.
   Her other hits included ``Two Lovers,'' ``The One Who Really
Loves You,'' ``Laughing Boy'' and ``What's the Matter With You
Baby?''

   A U.N. committee today allowed India to
send food to its citizens trapped by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The
vote came hours after the Security Council set strict guidelines
for exceptions to the trade embargo.
   ``Let us be frank - there is food in Iraq and Kuwait, but the
Iraqi authorities have chosen to deprive the most vulnerable
elements of the civilian society, pushing them to the brink of
starvation,'' U.S. Ambassdor Thomas Pickering said.
   The Security Council voted 13-2 late Thursday to allow food
shipments to Iraq or occupied Kuwait only ``to relieve human
suffering'' and said humanitarian organizations must distribute the
aid.
   The council's committee on sanctions met later and gave India
permission to send a shipload of food to its 140,000 citizens in
Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   ``In line with the resolution just adopted, the Sanctions
Committee has approved the sailing of a ship'' from India to Kuwait
to assist Indian and other nationals in Kuwait and Iraq, Pickering
said.
   Under the U.N. embargo, passed four days after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, only medical supplies or ``in humanitarian
circumstances, foodstuffs'' may be sent to Iraq or Kuwait.
   India and the Philippines had appealed to the Security Council's
sanctions committee for permission to send food to their people
still stranded in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraq has said it will not feed the 140,000 Indians, 93,000 Sri
Lankans and 60,000 Filipinos it holds, but that they must rely on
their governments.
   The resolution passed late Thursday night said the International
Committee of the Red Cross or ``other appropriate humanitarian
agencies'' should distribute food or supervise its distribution.
   That left open the possibility that the Iraqi Red Crescent, one
of the Moslem national charities that are members of the
International Red Cross, might be allowed to handle food
distribution.
   Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Al-Anbari said Wednesday that only
``Iraqi authorities'' could distribute food in his country.
   India has said it would like to distribute the shipment of
11,000 tons of food it is sending to Kuwait through its consulate.
Pickering said U.N. officials ``will be watching closely'' this
shipment and its distribution.
   The ship is expected to arrive in five to seven days.
   The United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France, Finland and
Canada sponsored Thursday's resolution, which also attracted the
votes of China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania
and Zaire. Cuba and Yemen voted against it.
   The resolution contains a narrow interpretation of humanitarian
circumstances, requiring that ``human suffering'' be verified by
independent experts.
   Under the resolution, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
woud seek information from U.N. agencies and other humanitarian
agencies on whether a desperate need for food exists in Iraq or
occupied Kuwait.
   While noting that the previous resolution permits the shipment
of medical supplies and medicines, the new resolution urges
countries sending medicines or supplies to closely supervise their
distribution.
   Thursday's resolution also insists Baghdad is responsible for
the safety and well-being of all foreigners it holds ``in
accordance with international humanitarian law, including, where
applicable, the Fourth Geneva Convention,'' which protects the
rights of civilians in territories under military occupation.
   On Thursday, Dutch customs Thursday impounded a
Bahamian-registered ship which was apparently carrying Iraqi-bound
cargo in defiance of U.N.-imposed trade sanctions, a spokeswoman
for the prosecutor's office said.
   Also Thursday, Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
confirmed Canada has stopped shipment of a shipload of grain bound
for Iraq.
   Iraq complained that Canada and Australia halted delivery of
120,000 tons of wheat purchased before the U.N. embargo.
   ``For it to have gone through to Iraq would have meant, in our
judgment, a break of the U.N. policy,'' Clark said in Toronto.

<HEAD>More Women Getting Mammograms, But Not Regularly Enough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More American women over 40 are having mammograms
to check for breast cancer, but most don't have them frequently
enough, a new survey shows.
   The survey, conducted earlier this year and reported Thursday by
the Centers for Disease Control, found that 64 percent of women 40
and older had undergone a mammogram - up sharply from 37 percent in
a similar survey in 1987.
   But only 31 percent in the new survey followed the recommended
mammography schedule: one every year or two for women in their 40s,
and once a year thereafter.
   Researchers said problems appear to be doctors who don't tell
their patients to have mammograms, and patients who don't think
they need them.
   Forty-five percent of the women who had never had a mammogram
said it was because no doctor ever told them to.
   ``Doctors are going to have to do a much better job of
recommending that women get mammograms, and get them on a regular
schedule,'' Dr. Douglas Marchant said in a statement from the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
   The college's Jacobs Institute of Women's Health commissioned
the study, which was conducted with the National Cancer Institute.
   Forty percent of the women who had never had a mammogram said
they weren't at risk because no one in their family had been a
breast cancer patient.
   ``For years, we've been telling women, `Look, if you have a
history of breast cancer in your family, you need a mammogram.' But
women have translated that as, if you don't, you don't,'' said Dr.
Sharyn Sutton of the cancer institute, a co-author of the study.
   Among the women who had received only one mammogram in their
lives, 35 percent believed that because it was negative they didn't
need another.
   ``Clearly, we need to help women understand the role of
mammograms in routine preventive health care,'' Marchant said.
``And we need to emphasize that a single mammogram is of little
benefit.''
   Researchers also found that as age goes up, compliance with
mammography recommendations goes down. While about 40 percent of
the women in their 40s got mammograms every year or two, as
recommended, fewer than 20 percent in their 70s got their yearly
tests.
   ``It's directly opposite to their increased risk,'' Sutton said.
``People perceive cancer as a disease you get at 55 or 65, and once
you're older than that, you got by, you escaped. I don't think
older women understand that you don't escape; you need to keep
going back every year.''
   The survey also found that nearly 40 percent of the women
questioned said ``mammograms cost too much'' and half said they
wouldn't pay as much as $150 for an annual mammogram.
   Mammograms can cost from $50 to $250, although most are $100 to
$125, said Dr. Marion Nadel, a CDC cancer specialist. The CDC noted
that 29 states require insurance companies to provide some level of
mammography coverage.
   Researchers estimate that 44,000 American women will die this
year of breast cancer. Previous studies have estimated that breast
cancer death rates could be lowered 30 percent if women received
mammograms as recommended by the NCI, the American Cancer Society
and other groups.
   The survey questioned 980 women in a national sampling, with a
margin of error of about 3 percent.

<HEAD>Saloon Ordered to Keep ``Spanky'' Out of Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George McFarland, the chubby child star
Spanky of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals,'' wants about $100,000
from a saloon that he says used his name and face for 13 years
without permission.
   Federal Judge James Rosenbaum on Thursday ordered the saloon not
to use the ``visage or name'' of Spanky. It's not enough for
McFarland.
   In March, seven months after McFarland filed a lawsuit, the
owner of the bar changed its name from Spanky's Saloon to Checker's
Nightclub.
   Drawings of a round-faced kid wearing a beanie came down from
the front of the building and from interior walls. Patrons no
longer could buy jackets, T-shirts and hats imprinted with the
Spanky's Saloon logo.
   Other businesses pay the McFarland, 62, who lives in Fort Worth,
Texas, for the right to use his name and childhood face. McFarland
wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former
co-owner of the St. Paul bar.
   ``He's after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and
that's an exorbitant amount of money, even if they did something
wrong,'' said Dennis Johnson, a lawyer for the bar's former owner,
Michael Kalis.
   Kalis sold his interest in the bar to his partner, Walter
Engelhardt, in 1982.
   Johnson and Engelhardt, who represented himself in court,
contend that the bar's name had little to do with its business and
that the connection with McFarland was unintentional.
   Marshall Tanick, a Minneapolis attorney representing McFarland,
said they denied his client his legitimate livelihood. He said the
Spanky name and image are McFarland's meal ticket.
   Tanick also accused the bar owners of tarnishing McFarland's
name by associating it with heavy metal bands that perform at the
bar. McFarland was shocked when he discovered his name had been
linked to such bands as ``Raw Meat,'' ``Primal Scream'' and ``Blue
Murder,'' Tanick said in court papers.
   ``Spanky's wholesome appeal, particularly to families and
children, is debased by associating him with these morbid
musicians,'' the lawsuit contended.
   In addition to 13 years of licensing fees and legal costs,
McFarland also wants all the merchandise and bar equipment
featuring the Spanky's logo.
   Rosenbaum urged attorneys to work out an agreement regarding the
merchandise and took McFarland's other claims under advisement.

   Hundreds of thousands of soldiers,
government workers and civilians were mobilized today to clean up
the rain-soaked capital, and floodwaters from the worst rainstorm
in 70 years began to recede.
   The Central Disaster Relief Center today said 106 people died,
40 were missing and 160,000 homeless in this week's flooding.
   Dozens of villages and large areas of farmland remained
underwater after the Han River that runs through the capital broke
through its embankment in outlying areas. While the water began
receding, more rain was forecast this weekend.
   Thousands of people remained quartered in public shelters, and
campaigns were launched for private funding and donations to help
those without homes. Authorities said 300,000 soldiers, reserve
forces, civilians and local officials were taking part in rescue
and relief activities.
   President Roh Tae-woo visited flood-struck residential areas in
eastern Seoul and pledged government support.
   Officials said damages to schools, homes, farmland, utilities,
roads and railroads would top $240 million.
   The Trade and Industry Ministry said more than 500 factories in
electronics, textiles and small manufacturing complexes outside
Seoul in Inchon and Kyonggi have been severely damaged. Economists
worried lost production time would further affect the country's
already sagging exports.
   Three days of torrential rain that ended Wednesday brought the
year's total rainfall to 90 inches, double the average annual
rainfall. In one 24-hour period, parts of Seoul received 15 inches.
   Some areas in the capital were without drinking water and
electricity today. Soldiers in jeeps and heavy trucks sloshed
through muddy streets to help homeowners dump household goods
destroyed by floodwaters.
   The piles of trash made some streets impassable. The stench of
rotting food, upholstery and wet clothing filled the air.
   Prices of fresh fruit and vegetables jumped by as much as 50
percent.
   Military and civilian engineers struggled to rebuild a broken
Han River embankment west of Seoul, where 83 townships and vast
areas of farmland were flooded. Dozens of villages remain
submerged, though the water was beginning to recede.
   Officials said 1,700 workers using army trucks and helicopters
dumped rocks, sand and dirt in more than 100,000 sandbangs to try
to restore the embankment, which was burst Wednesday by the
rain-swollen river.
   A 53-year-old farm woman tried to poison herself in despair over
flooding of her family's farm, news reports said. About 100 farmers
continued to refuse to leave stranded livestock and remained
isolated and surrounded by floodwaters, reports said.

   Salvadoran negotiators have begun
their fifth attempt this year to end a nearly 11-year-old war. The
army said new fighting between rebels and troops has killed or
wounded 66 people.
   El Salvador's U.S.-backed administration and the leftist
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front began the latest round of
talks Thursday and were to meet again today. They agreed earlier
this year to try to reach a cease-fire by Saturday.
   But failure to agree on the issue of army reform, the main
stumbling block in talks since then, has dashed hopes of meeting
the goal.
   ``I take a bath of pessimism every day - we musn't expect any
important agreement from this meeting,'' U.N. mediator Alvaro de
Soto told reporters at the end of talks Thursday.
   Rebel negotiator Roberto Roca charged that government changes in
military officers' positions in recent weeks do not meet the
rebels' demands to purge the army of members accused of human
rights abuses.
   Despite the standoff over military reform, Justice Minister
Oscar Santamaria said his delegation hoped for progress in the
round of talks scheduled to continue through Tuesday.
   The army reported 61 rebels and soldiers killed or injured and
five civilians injured in stepped-up fighting outside of San
Salvador on Wednesday night and Thursday morning.
   The civil war has claimed more than 73,000 lives, most of them
civilians. An estimated 30,000 were believed killed by right-wing
death squads linked to the military.
   The only accord the negotiators have reached this year is an
agreement to form a commission verifying human rights protection in
El Salvador. They have not agreed on when the commission will be
established.
   The government has called on the rebels to disarm as a condition
for cease-fire, a demand the rebels refuse to accept.

   Jackpot fantasies are in full bloom in
Florida, where Lottery players snapped up tickets at 500 a second
in hopes of winning an estimated $100 million.
   ``I'm getting lost with all the zeroes,'' said Lottery Secretary
Rebecca Paul, who added a ninth digit Thursday to the projected
jackpot.
   No more projections will be announced before Saturday night's
televised drawing, she said.
   A $100 million jackpot would be the second largest in U.S.
history. State lottery officials doubted the jackpot would break
the $115 million record split among 14 winning tickets in
Pennsylvania's Super 7 game in April 1989.
   The number of winners will be announced Sunday. The final size
of the jackpot will not be determined until Monday, Mrs. Paul said.
   The heaviest ticket sales Thursday were reported along Florida's
borders with Georgia and Alabama. Tickets are not sold outside the
state.
   Joe Revolta and Robert Bache traveled from New Orleans to buy
10,000 tickets at $1 apiece at Groovin' Noovin's, a Pensacola
convenience store near the Alabama-Florida state line.
   ``You might not have much of a chance, but you have even less if
you don't play,'' Revolta said.
   Long-distance telephone calls poured into the state to friends
and relatives asked to buy tickets for thousands of people
attracted by the huge prize.
   Lotto mania even brought warnings from Lotto officials to spend
prudently, and a gamblers' group questioned why the lottery is not
providing money to treat compulsive gamblers.
   ``Half of the people in one Gamblers Anonymous meeting said they
were tempted because of the lottery,'' said Paul Ashe, executive
director of the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling.
   To play the Florida Lotto game, players select six numbers from
one to 49. The winning numbers are chosen at random during a
weekly, televised drawing.
   The odds of one ticket containing all six winning numbers are
about one-in-14 million. But for every dollar spent, there was a
dream.
   ``I'd get a 200-foot yacht and staff it with chicks in bikinis
from stem to stern and go to Europe,'' said 19-year-old Ricky Ford,
a Tallahassee college student who spent $20 on tickets.
   ``First, I would help the church in any way I could, then I
would by a ticket to fly to the moon,'' said Anne Straub, 66, of
Gulf Breeze. ``I've just always wanted to go into space.''
   Bahamians carrying thousands of dollars are flying to South
Florida to buy lottery tickets to resell at a higher price back
home, the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported.
   ``They come every Friday. This week they will bring $4,000 to
$5,000,'' said George Prado, who sells lottery tickets at the
Caribe Cafeteria, a Cuban restaurant near the Miami International
Airport.

   Police eliminated the Doe Gang without firing
a single shot.
   For 17 days, the Pekin Daily News blamed nearly every crime in
this Illinois River city on John, Jane and assorted other Does to
protest the police department's refusal to identify people
arrested.
   Police agreed to reveal real names and the newspaper's Doe Watch
has come to an end.
   ``The Doe family was a ficticious creation of the police as a
way to shield the names of people arrested each day,'' said Kent R.
Davy, the Times' managing editor. ``Apparently it was the historic
practice of the Pekin police to shield the names of those arrested
by listing them as John Doe or Jane Doe.''
   Police Chief Jack Leuck scrapped the secrecy policy Sept. 4,
allowing the Times to print the names of everyone arrested daily
after city lawyers advised him the department may be violating
state law
   Leuck, a retired FBI agent, said he took over a year ago and was
told the policy had been in effect at least 15 years. He said the
police changed suspects' names to Doe to protect anyone who was not
formally charged.
   ``Sometimes we pick someone up and the victim decides not to
press charges,'' he said. ``People change their story or make
things up and we end up releasing the individual who was arrested.
If that arrest is reported, it can cause an individual irreparable
harm.''
   Davy, a lawyer and former assistant prosecutor in Guam, sees it
differently. He said abuses could occur if police arrest records
are kept secret in the city of 34,000 people, near Peoria in
central Illinois.
   ``People ought not be whisked away and jailed without the public
knowing,'' Davy said in an editorial. ``People of position and
influence ought not to be able to avoid prosecution after an arrest
without everyone knowing.''

   An Air Force team has
begun an investigation into why a Titan 4 rocket fell off a crane
and caught fire last week, killing one person and injuring eight.
   The team is headed by Brig. Gen. Ralph G. Tourino, commander of
the Air Force System Command's Ballistic Missile Organization at
Norton Air Force Base near San Bernardino, spokesman Ranney Adams
said Thursday.
   Portions of a 400-foot-tall crane and a segment of a Titan 4
rocket's twin boosters toppled Sept. 7 at Edwards, the Air Force
said.
   The rocket segment, 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, ignited when
it hit the ground, sending a spectacular cloud of smoke 12,000 feet
into the sky.
   An aide to U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said ``the Pentagon
seems to think there was a problem with the crane.'' The crane's
builder denied that and questioned the soundness of the ground
beneath the crane.
   The Air Force has refused to comment, saying no further
information will be released pending completion of the

   Japan today earmarked an additional $3 billion for
international forces in the Persian Gulf region and for nations
suffering from the U.N. embargo on Iraq.
   The government, accused of being slow and miserly in providing
such support, said the new funding will bring Japan's total aid
toward meeting the gulf crisis to more than $4 billion.
   The United States has complained Japan was not contributing
enough, especially considering its high dependence on Middle East
oil. The House of Representatives made its displeasure known in a
resolution Wednesday calling for Japan to pay all expenses of
American troops based in Japan.
   ``If they had known the magnitude of the total package of
contribution measures which we have announced today, they would
know how serious Japan is in trying to cooperate with the United
States and other countries in keeping the peace and security in
that region, even at the sacrifice of our own fiances,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu had phoned President Bush to notify him of the
expanded contribution.
   ``President Bush expressed deep appreciation and told Kaifu that
he will tell his people that Japan is playing an active role in the
international effort in the Gulf,'' Sakamoto told reporters.
   Sakamoto said Japan would provide up to $1 billion to the
U.S.-led forces deployed in the gulf region after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. Japan on Aug. 29 had pledged $1 billion.
   Another $2 billion would go to such countries as Egypt, Jordan
and Turkey facing difficulties from joining in the U.N. economic
embargo imposed against Iraq, he added.
   Sakamoto said Japan would give $600 million immediately to those
three nations as an ``exceptional measure,'' in the form of a loan
at 1 percent annual interest, repayable in 30 years.
   Japan would decide how to provide the additional $1.4 billion
depending on how the situation develops, he added.
   The $4 billion total figure matched the contribution that
Japanese media reports said the United States was demanding from
Japan.
   Watanabe said, however, it was ``our own decision.''
   Sakamoto said the expanded contribution was the maximum Japan
could provide at this point.
   Responding to criticism that Japan had acted slowly, Watanabe
said Japan had constitutional and legal restraints against sending
military forces overseas. He said Tokyo had not been consulted on
operational details for the multinational peacekeeping forces in
the gulf, although it was willing to cooperate with them.
   ``Therefore, when we are asked to pay the bill, we have to check
the contents of the invoice, and we have to examine what is the
real thinking behind it. That is something quite natural,'' he
said.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. House approved, 370 to 53, a resolution
stating that the United States would withdraw 5,000 U.S. troops
each year from Japan until Tokyo agrees to pay the full cost of all
50,000 troops now stationed in Japan. The resolution has not been
passed by the Senate.
   The United States spends $4.5 billion annually for the U.S.
forces in Japan, while Japan currently contributes about $2.9
billion.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet
Moses was known to ancient Egyptians as Ikhnaton, the ruler and
religious reformer.
   ``I am convinced that I have identified Moses as Ikhnaton, the
prophet, poet and king in the 14th century B.C., who shut the
temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared
there was only one god,'' said Ahmed Osman.
   His book, ``Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt,'' was published in Britain
on Thursday by Grafton Books. The U.S. rights are under
negotiation.
   Osman's first book in 1987, ``Stranger in the Valley of Kings,''
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named Yuya was Joseph,
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe
of Israel into Egypt.
   Osman, 55, an Egyptian who has pursued research in Egyptology
and the Bible in London for 25 years, is regarded by academics as a
controversial but respected outsider.
   Younes Ahmed el-Batrik, cultural counselor at the Egyptian
Embassy, held a reception Thursday night to launch Osman's book.
``It's a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and
I will be interested to hear what the experts say about it,'' he
said.
   In identifying Moses with Ikhnaton, Osman builds on Sigmund
Freud's last book, ``Moses and Monotheism,'' in which the father of
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the
two ancients.
   Sydney Leperer, a senior history lecturer at Jews' College,
University of London, said of Osman's Ikhnaton-Moses theory:
``There is a faint possibility that it is true, although I have my
doubts.''
   Donald B. Redford, professor of Near Eastern studies at Toronto
University and an expert on Ikhnaton, scoffed at the theory.
   ``There is no evidence that Ikhnaton was a man called Moses and
the religious teachings of Ikhnaton have nothing to do with Moses,
who appears to have lived five centuries after him or longer,''
Redford said in a telephone interview.
   Naim Dangoor, editor of The Scribe, a journal on Babylonian
Jewry, said he had read and reviewed both of Osman's books. Osman
``knows a great deal about the period,'' and his theories ``invite
further investigation,'' Dangoor said.
   Osman said in an interview that scholars had always had
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures
in the Old Testament and Egyptian history.
   ``I believe that Moses had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian
father,'' he said.
   ``He was the son of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye,
daughter of Joseph the Patriarch. Tiye's first son had mysteriously
disappeared so when Moses was born, Tiye sent him by water for
safekeeping to her Israelite relatives. I think that was the origin
of the story that Moses was found in the bulrushes on the Nile.''
   After 17 years as pharaoh, Ikhnaton was deposed and succeeded by
the boy prince, Tutankhamen.
   ``I believe Ikhnaton survived and went into exile in Sinai with
a few followers,'' Osman said. ``When the oppressor Pharaoh
Horemheb died, Ikhnaton saw his chance to regain his throne as
there was no heir. He challenged Horemheb's general, Ramses, for
the throne but Ramses attacked him and forced him to flee. The
flight was the Exodus, in 1333 B.C.''
   ``Ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter Canaan, the
Promised Land, but were slaughtered by Ramses' successor, Seti I.
This fight is recorded in the Temple of Karnak in Luxor,'' the
author said.
   Jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between
Moses and Egypt because of memories of the oppression, Osman
believes. ``However, the Talmud (the Jewish law) indicates that
Moses became a king and was forced to abdicate,'' he added.
   Eric Uphill, an Egyptologist at London's University College,
said he helped and supported Osman's research because he regarded
Osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge.
   Osman's manuscript was based on the right sources for Egyptian
history, Uphill said, but he would not comment on the conclusions
without further study.
   ``The problem with Moses is that the historical truth about him
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories, some of them
haywire,'' Leperer said.
   Dangoor said Moses' death is a mystery that is not resolved in
the Exodus accounts. ``Osman's explanation that he was killed by
Seti I is very plausible,'' Dangoor said.

<HEAD>200 Sikh Widows Demand Justice for Mob Slayings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 200 widows of Sikhs slain by Hindu
mobs six years ago wept, screamed and beat their chests outside the
prime minister's home today, demanding the killers be arrested.
   ``We will not go until we get justice!'' cried 50-year-old Gopi
Kaur, who lost 12 male relatives - including her husband and
brothers - in the violence.
   Her outburst was supported by a religious battle cry shouted by
the other women outside the residence of Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
Most of them wore white, the color of mourning for Sikh and Hindu
widows.
   More than 2,000 Sikhs were killed in New Delhi alone in
anti-Sikh rioting after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was
assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards Oct. 31, 1984. About 700 Sikhs
were killed in similar riots across the nation.
   Many Sikhs, as well as human rights groups blamed the killings
of Sikhs on members of Mrs. Gandhi's Congress Party assisted by
hired toughs.
   Only 11 of the 225 people charged with murder and looting have
been convicted. Three special courts have been set up in New Delhi
to deal with the cases, but their progress has bogged down in legal
and bureaucratic wrangles.
   Today's protest was sparked by the government's failure Tuesday
to arrest a prominent local Congress Party leader, Sajjan Kumar. A
police party that went to Kumar's house to make the arrest returned
empty-handed after thousands of Kumar's supporters surrounded the
house and threatened to lynch the officers.
   The mob wrecked two cars of the police officials and blocked
traffic for several hours. In the meantime, Kumar obtained a Delhi
High Court order that would grant bail in event of his arrest in
connection with a murder case.
   ``We ... are pained that Sajjan Kumar has escaped arrest by
strong-arm tactics and through ... muscle-power by indulging in
violence,'' the protest organizers, the All India Sikh Conference,
said in a letter to the prime minister. A copy was given to
reporters.
   Sikhs and human rights activists have accused Kumar of
personally leading death squads in the aftermath of Mrs. Gandhi's
assassination.
   The women accused Mrs. Gandhi's son, Rajiv Gandhi, of stalling
the prosecution during his term as prime minister between 1984 and
1989.
   ``But we derive confidence that in your regime, justice will not
be denied any longer,'' the Sikhs said in their letter to Singh,
who succeeded Gandhi in December 1989.
   Many of the Sikh victims were hacked, tortured and burned to
death with blazing car tires jammed over their shoulders.

   The dollar recovered slightly against the yen in
European trading this morning, but it was down from the previous
day's levels against all major currencies.
   Gold was marginally higher.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 136.55 yen, down 1.10 yen from
Thursday's close of 137.65 yen. It was the lowest closing level
since Aug. 3, 1989, when it was 136.40 yen.
   Later in London, the dollar rose to 136.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   -1.5683 German marks, down from 1.574
   -1.3045 Swiss francs, down from 1.313
   -5.2545 French francs, down from 5.271
   -1.7655 Dutch guilders, down from 1.774
   -1,170 Italian lire, down from 1,174
   -1.16 Canadian dollars, down from 1.164
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8855, compared
with $1.877 late Thursday.
   The dollar opened lower in Tokyo following an overnight decline
in New York. It recovered slightly as investors sold yen to take
profits against the dollar and European currencies, they said.
   ``Investors focused on cross-trading involving the dollar, the
yen and the German mark,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with
Chemical Bank in Tokyo. She said the dollar's weakness has become a
firm trend due to continuing pessimism over the U.S. economy.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$384.30 per ounce at midmorning, up from $384 bid per ounce late
Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $384.25, up from $383.40 late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $2.52 an ounce today to close at $384.34.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.81 a troy ounce,
down from Thursday's $4.82.

<HEAD>Florida Court Expands Right to Die</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives or guardians of brain-damaged
people can order the removal of feeding tubes that keep them alive,
the Florida Supreme Court said in a ruling hailed by
``right-to-die'' advocates.
   ``It reaffirms the rights of Floridians under our (state)
constitution to make their own decisions about what will be done
with their bodies,'' said Charlene Carres, a Tallahassee attorney
for the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Roman Catholics, anti-abortion groups and other opponents did
not immediately respond, saying they needed more time to review the
ruling.
   The decision focused on an elderly woman who died last summer.
Estelle Browning spent the last 2{ years of her life hooked up to
feeding tubes that she had specified in a ``living will'' she
didn't want.
   Mrs. Browning suffered permanent brain damage in a stroke and
was left in a persistent vegetative state, unable to swallow or
communicate. She was not comatose. Doris Herbert, Mrs. Browning's
second cousin and only living relative, was named her guardian.
   Herbert sought permission to remove the tubes in 1988. The state
fought the request and a trial court denied it, but a state appeals
court said the Florida Constitution allowed for removal of the
tubes and the issue was reviewed by the Supreme Court.
   ``We hold that, because Mrs. Browning was unable to exercise her
constitutional right of privacy by reason of her medical condition,
her guardian was authorized to exercise it for her,'' Justice
Rosemary Barkett wrote.
   When people take ``the time and trouble'' to write ``living
wills,'' express their wishes orally or appoint health-care
surrogates, there's no need to go before a judge to get permission
to carry out their wishes, the court ruled.
   Patricia Dore, a law professor at Florida State University who
drafted the privacy clause added to the state constitution in 1980,
said it was significant that the justices ruled there was no legal
distinction between food and water supplied through tubes and other
medical treatments, like respirators.
   Although it has no direct impact outside Florida, attorneys and
advocates said other state courts could be influenced by the case.
   ``I think many, many state courts look to Florida for guidance
on issues that affect the elderly,'' said George Felos, an attorney
who represented Herbert.
   Florida's high court heard oral arguments in the case in
January. Six months later, the U.S. Supreme Court said a Missouri
couple could not order the removal of food and water keeping their
32-year-old comatose daughter alive.
   The daughter, Nancy Cruzan, had not left a living will. Her
parents said they were certain she would prefer to die rather than
live in a coma. In its split decision, the nation's high court said
competent people have a right to refuse medical treatment.

<HEAD>Desert Uniform Too Hot for Searing Heat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL BASKERVILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT LEE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Camouflage uniforms worn by American troops
in Saudi Arabia are made for cooler climates, not searing desert
heat, military and clothing industry officials say.
   The problem is the hot weather uniform, made entirely of cotton,
doesn't have the desert camouflage pattern.
   The uniform worn by troops is made of the same material - half
nylon and half cotton - that was criticized as hot and
uncomfortable by American soldiers during the 1982 invasion of
Grenada.
   Weather conditions are much harsher in the Saudi desert than in
Grenada. Daytime temperatures have gone as high as 120 degrees
since U.S. forces were sent there in August after Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
   Jeffrey J. Weinsten, former chairman of an American Apparel
Manufacturers Association committee that oversees government
contracts, said the all-cotton uniform is more comfortable than the
blend because ``cotton is a moisture-loving fabric that licks away
perspiration.''
   The blend ``is not absorbent at all,'' he said.
   The all-cotton uniform breathes better because it has a more
open weave, but it's hard to find in the desert camouflage pattern,
Weinsten said.
   Frank Johnson, a spokesman for the Defense Personnel Support
Center in Philadelphia, said there are no hot-weather uniforms in
the desert pattern because ``the powers that be said if there is a
war it would probably involve the Warsaw Pact'' in Europe.
   ``Obviously we didn't figure on something like this breaking out
in the Middle East,'' Johnson said.
   Johnson defended the choice of uniforms, saying the camouflage
version is more durable than the cotton version. Weinsten agreed
the blend fabric has greater strength and can resist desert sand
better, but said comfort is more important.
   All-cotton desert uniforms make sense, said Philip M. Cavanaugh,
director of the Quartermaster Museum at the Army Logistics Center
at Fort Lee. ``It's what they should have done to begin with,'' he
said.
   Asked why the desert camouflage pattern wasn't printed on cotton
uniforms, Col. John Duff, deputy commander at the Army's research
development and engineering center in Natick, Mass., where the
uniform was developed, said: ``I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot
pole.''
   Chemical weapons suits U.S. troops have in the Saudi desert are
so heavy and unbearable that the Marines have replaced them with a
lighter-weight, British-made model, a military spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Athene Seyler, Comedy Actress, Dies At Age 101</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedy actress Athene Seyler, whose stage, movie
and radio career spanned most of this century, has died, her family
reported. She was 101.
   She died at her home in London on Wednesday, her family said.
They did not give details on funeral arrangements.
   Said by one theater critic to resemble ``an irritable
hippopotamus'' on stage, she was recognized in the acting
profession as one of the great technical experts on high comedy.
   She specialized in playing quirky queens and crusty dowagers
with plummy voices and quivering chins. She especially favored the
plays of William Congreve, Oscar Wilde, William Wycherley and
Richard Sheridan.
   Critic James Agate once said that when it came to comedy, she
could act any other English actress off the stage.
   Her plain looks generally ruled out romantic roles but combined
with her sharp intelligence and vitality proved a considerable
comic asset.
   In later life, she was mockingly critical of playwrights and
directors alike.
   Of Harold Pinter's 1975 play ``No Man's Land,'' she remarked:
``I couldn't follow a word of it ... When one of the characters
yawned, I said `Oh, I do so agree' rather too loudly and people (in
the audience) turned and stared at me.''
   She made her London stage debut in 1909, but it was not until
1920 when she played Rosalind in Shakespeare's ``As You Like It''
that her special talent for high comedy first showed.
   She appeared in almost 20 movies, including ``Quiet Wedding'' in
1940, ``Dear Octopus'' in 1943, ``Nicholas Nickleby'' in 1947 and
``Pickwick Papers'' in 1952.
   Her last major stage appearance was in 1966 at the age of 77 in
a memorable revival of the comedy ``Arsenic and Old Lace'' in which
she co-starred with Dame Sybil Thorndike. She continued working on
radio until she was well into her late 80s.
   Her first husband was newspaper editor James Bury
Sterndale-Bennett, by whom she had a daughter. Her second husband,
actor Nicholas Hannen, died in 1972.

   Ten weeks of training by drug-sniffing
dogs came to a snarling conclusion when they had to be separated at
their graduation.
   The six Labrador retrievers were sent to their handlers' cars
Thursday after bearing fangs during a ceremony at the Public
Service Commission's offices.
   The dogs get along with almost everyone except one another and
will go to work this week making roadside truck inspections across
the state.
   ``I think they were a little afraid of the cameras,'' said Keith
Bissell, commission chairman.
   The ceremony went on without the dogs.

<HEAD>Reagan Praises American Troops in Berlin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan today said
U.S. troops in Berlin played an important role in the movements to
democracy in Eastern Europe.
   Reagan spoke to about 1,000 American military people and
dependents at Tempelhof Airport before flying to Poland, the second
stop on his 10-day trip that also includes a visit to the Soviet
Union.
   ``Nowhere have the events been more dramatic than here in
Berlin,'' Reagan said to the largely military audience on the
airport tarmac, in front of two old planes that flew food to West
Berlin during the Soviet blockade more than four decades ago.
   ``What you are doing here played an important role in the events
of Nov. 9,'' Reagan said, referring to the day the Berlin Wall was
opened last year.
   As a souvenir, U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters gave the former
president one of the Berlin sector division signs that said in four
languages, ``You are leaving the American sector.''
   Reagan said the 7-by-10-foot sign would become part of his
presidential library in Simi Valley, Calif.
   While in Berlin, Reagan used a hammer and chisel on the Berlin
Wall, taking symbolic whacks at the old Cold War barrier, and also
visited Bonn, the West German capital, where he met Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and President Richard von Weizsaecker.

<HEAD>Action Postponed on Catholic Bishops' Letter on Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Wrtiter</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have postponed
action on a divisive pastoral letter about women and plan extensive
international consultations that make its fate highly uncertain.
   The decision Thursday by the bishops' administrative committee
will mean a prolonged delay in final action on the letter, if not
it's ultimate scuttling as some critics have demanded.
   The letter, in the works for five years, had been scheduled for
action in November by the fall meeting of the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops.
   The conference president, Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of
Cincinnati, said the letter would only be discussed then as an
``information item'' and would not be considered for action.
   Athough not binding, pastoral letters are circulated among
Catholic churches and serve as a guide for educational efforts,
preaching and the training of semarians.
   The letter is called ``One in Jesus Christ - A Pastoral Response
to the Concerns of Women for Church and Society.''
   Pilarczyk said the Vatican had suggested consultating bishops
outside the United States before acting on it because of the
significance of the topic and influence of the U.S. church.
   ``Our conference deems such a recommendation a wise one,''
Pilarczyk said.
   Last month, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious,
comprised of 800 heads of women's religious orders, asked that the
proposed letter be dropped, calling it ``intrinsically
contradictory.''
   Other Catholic organizations and some bishops also had
criticized the declaration as seeming to uphold equality for women,
yet hedging it, and continuing to defend their exclusion from
ordination to the priesthood.
   The latest 99-page draft, released in March, says men and women
are ``equal in dignity'' and women should have more equitiable
roles in ``leadership, ministry, teaching and policy-making'' in
the church.
   However, the draft reiterated the church's ban against ordaining
women and defended limiting the priesthood to men as the practice
of Jesus and his apostles.
   Leaders of the nuns' organizations said the letter's position on
equality was ``undermined and contradicted'' in its internal
development, especially in repeating the prohibition to women's
ordination.
   A bishops' committee, headed by Bishop Joseph Imesch of Joliet,
Ill., held hearings for several years across the country, seeking
input from women about the letter. The latest revisions failed to
satisfy its critics.
   ``Dear bishops, you embarass us,'' said liberal Catholic
theologian Rosemary Radford Reuther. ``You insult our
intelligence.''
   She said the proposed letter criticizes sexism but ``reaffirms
every aspect of the patriarchal system that is the basis of
sexism.''
   An independent Catholic study center, the Washington-based
Center of Concern, also had urged the bishops to scrap the letter.
   ``It is easy to see the bind the authors are in,'' said
Milwaukee Arcbbishop Rembert Weakland, a staunch advocate of a
greater women's role in the church, alluding to the Vatican's
position against women's ordination.
   He said the ``very crediblity of the document comes into
question'' in reprimanding society for inequalities and calling for
struggle against sexism, then upholding church policies that
reflect it.

<HEAD>Cardinal Who Backed Freedom During Cold War to Retire Within a
Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, an
outspoken advocate of religious freedom during decades of Communist
control, is planning to retire within a month, the official CTK
news agency says.
   ``The age of 91 is not normal for activities in any field,
including the church,'' CTK on Thursday quoted Czechoslovakia's
senior Roman Catholic clergyman as saying.
   Tomasek said his request to be relieved must be handled by a new
papal nuncio who should assume his duties within the month, the
agency said.
   Diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia and Vatican resumed
in April after a hiatus of 40 years.
   Tomasek said one of Prague's bishops should be considered to
succeed him.
   In July 1989, four months before the peaceful revolution that
ended decades of Communist rule, thousands of people attended a
Mass in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral to help the cardinal celebrate
his 90th birthday.
   In a short address then, Tomasek stressed the importance of
their religious faith to Czechoslovak believers. ``Only Christ can
give an answer to the hunger of our minds for truth and to the
thirst of our hearts for love,'' he said.
   About half of Czechoslovakia's 15 million people are Roman
Catholics.
   Tomasek became a bishop in 1949 and was arrested two years
later. He was interned during a severe Communist crackdown on
religious practice, and freed in 1954.
   He was made a cardinal in June 1977 and archbishop of Prague
that December.

Utah, set a record for the month of September by reaching 100
degrees.
   Slightly cooler weather was expected for the West today, with
rain in Northern California and Oregon and patches of frost in
portions of Wyoming possible. Most of the region could expect highs
in the 90s, but Arizona and Southern California were expected to
have temperatures in the 100s.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted for the Northeast, Great

   Iraq will begin rationing bread beginning
Saturday, the ruling party's newspaper reported today, adding to a
list of other basic food items being limited since a U.N. embargo
began.
   The Ministry of Trade ordered all bakeries and bread shops on
Saturday to observe the rationing announced earlier this month,
which limits bread to three pieces per person per day, the Baath
Party newspaper Al-Tharawa reported.
   Iraqis must present bread coupons to designated bread shops to
receive their allocations, Al-Tharwa said.
   According to the rationing system, each Iraqi will have access
to 13.2 pounds of wheat flour each month, in the form of flour or
bread.
   Large lines have formed at bread shops since the U.N.-imposed
economic embargo against Iraq and Kuwait in reaction to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Iraq also has imposed a rationing system for other basic food
items such as rice, sugar and cooking oil, as well as soap and
detergent.
   President Saddam Hussein also has asked Iraqis to cut back on
their consumption of meat and to prepare for belt-tightening to
cope with the U.N.-imposed trade embargo.
   The embargo prevents the import of goods as well as the export
of oil, Iraq's chief source of revenue.

said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The flight is scheduled to take women, children and American men
of Arab origin, the official said. Eighteen Britons also would be
among the Westerners on board, the Foreign Office in London said.
   Since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait prompted U.S. and other
forces to deploy in the Persian Gulf region, Iraq has held
Americans and other Westerners as human shields at potential
military targets.
   However, late last month Baghdad agreed to begin releasing
mostly women and children.
   The U.S. Embassy official said he hoped the Boeing 747,
chartered by the U.S. government, would leave Baghdad around 6 p.m.
(10 a.m. EDT). However, delays have been the norm in previous
flight evacuating Westerners from Kuwait and Iraq.
   It would be the second time in three days that a flight brought
Westerners out of Iraq.
   On Wednesday 288 Americans, 70 Britons and 70 people of other
nationalities left Iraq aboard a jumbo jet jointly chartered by the
American and British governments. Officials earlier said the flight
carried 300 Americans. No explanation was given for the
discrepancy.
   A separate flight the same day took 10 ailing and elderly
Italian men to Rome.
   The Voice of America, the U.S. government-run shortwave radio
network, has been broadcasting appeals to American women and
children in Kuwait to join the evacuation flight or another one
planned for Saturday, the embassy official said. He did not know
how many evacuees might take the Saturday flight.
   About 6,500 Westerners remain stranded in Iraq and Kuwait, many
of them in hiding.
   They are believed to include about 1,500 Americans in Kuwait,
according to the U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad. At least 2,500
Americans were in Kuwait at the time of the Iraqi invasion, the
official said.
   Palestinian diplomats in Baghdad said late Thursday that an
estimated 1,000 Palestinians a day who had fled after the invasion
are returning to Kuwait. The diplomats did not have a total on the
number of Palestinians who had returned.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Slumped 0.6 Percent in August</HEAD>

   Retail sales slumped 0.6 percent in August
despite a huge jump in gasoline station purchases, the government
said today in its first report on consumer spending since the
Persian Gulf crisis eruped Aug. 2.
   Some analysts had said in advance that the report would be
skewed by sharply higher gasoline prices that would offset falling
sales elsewhere. Indeed, sales in nearly all other categories
declined.
   Much of the increase in gasoline sales apparently represented
increased prices rather than volume. The American Petroleum
Institute said gasoline prices rose about 20 percent since Iraq
overran Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The Commerce Department said overall sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted $149.2 billion, down from $150.0 billion in July. The July
sales, which rose 0.4 percent, turned out to be stronger than the
0.1 percent gain originally reported last month.
   But a 1.1 percent advance in June had been the first increase
since last January and analysts worried whether developments in the
Middle East would jack up prices and erode consumer confidence,
driving sales back down.
   Indeed, two major consumer confidence surveys - one conducted by
the Conference Board in New York and another by the University of
Michigan - plummeted after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Since consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, there was concern a dropoff could help push the
nation into a recession. Retail sales account for about half of
overall consumer spending.
   The Commerce report said gasoline station sales jumped 6.4
percent in August, the largest increase since an 8.3 percent
advance in August 1979.
   Excluding the gasoline category, retail sales tumbled even
farther, down 1.1 percent.
   Automobile sales fell 4.3 percent, their largest drop since a
5.6 percent decrease last January. Excluding the automobile
category, sales would have risen 0.4 percent.
   Sales of durable goods, which includes cars and other items
expected to last more than three years, slid 2.6 percent after
rising 0.7 percent the previous month.
   Besides automobiles, other components of the durable category
were mixed. Sales of building materials were off 2.4 percent, while
sales of furniture and other home furnishings rose 0.7 percent.
   Non-durable goods, which include food and gasoline, rose 0.6
percent following July's 0.3 percent gain.
   But other than gasoline, all other non-durable categories fell.
   Sales at department stores were down 0.2 percent; grocery
stores, off 0.2 percent; clothing stores, down 0.9 percent;
restaurants and bars, off 0.7 percent, and drug stores, down 0.5
percent.

   Searchers began a second day of picking
through swamps, bush and wooded areas this morning near the
apartment of a suspect in the slayings of five college students,
police said.
   Some objects were found during Thursday's first day of hunting,
but there was no immediate word on whether they were connected to
the case, said Alachua County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt.
Spencer Mann.
   The search party was combing 10 square miles near the residence
of University of Florida freshman Edward Lewis Humphrey, one of
eight suspects in the slayings.
   ``It's a long, slow process,'' Mann said.
   Searchers included Florida National Guardsmen, sailors from the
Orlando Naval Training Center, military reserve officers and police
from state and local agencies. Two helicopters aided searchers in
Thursday's 90-degree heat, and about 10 dog teams were called in.
   The dog teams were looking for body parts from the five victims,
but Mann said such parts might already have decayed in the three
weeks since the bodies of the students were discovered.
   Some searchers carried metal detectors and rods for probing the
ground. The work was expected to be wrapped up later today,
officials said.
   Meanwhile, two agents with the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement began what the agency calls an ``executive
investigation'' aimed at learning who has been leaking information
to reporters.
   Lie-detector tests may be used and those found to have given out
unauthorized information could face disciplinary action and
criminal charges, said police spokeswoman Lt. Sadie Darnell.
   Police say the leaks have hurt their investigation.
   Once again Thursday, police were secretive about their progress,
and refused to comment on reports their case may have been badly
compromised when investigators first interrogated Humphrey, 18,
following his arrest on charges of assaulting his grandmother.
   A series of newspaper reports have said Humphrey was questioned
in the Brevard County Jail without an attorney present, and the
public defenders who finally showed up were sent away when
prosecutors dropped the assault charges, only to refile them when
the lawyers left.
   Humphrey was not brought to court until 36 hours after he was
taken into custody.
   Humphrey, who is being treated by a doctor for manic-depressive
disorder, reportedly implicated one of his multiple personalities
in the slayings and told police where to look for some evidence.
   Humphrey remains jailed in the Aug. 30 beating of his
grandmother. He also faces warrants in an October 1988 armed
burglary and attempted rape in Indian River County and an Aug. 25
assault on two male university students.
   The mutilated bodies of Sonja Larson, 18, and Christina Powell,
17, were found Aug. 26 in their off-campus apartment. The next
morning, Christa Hoyt, 18, was found decapitated in her nearby
duplex. Manuel Taboada, and Tracy Paules, both 23, were found dead
Aug. 28 in another nearby apartment.
   All were students either at the University of Florida or Santa
Fe Community College.

<HEAD>`Historic' Okeechobee, Everglades Plan Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar growers, the water district
and the state of Florida have agreed to share the cost of a $120
million plan to clean up the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee.
   Under the plan, approved Thursday by the South Florida Water
Management District, about 74,000 acres of farmland are to be
bought and converted into marshes to filter phosphorus-laden
agricultural runoff blamed for much of the pollution plaguing the
Lake Okeechobee-Everglades system.
   Water flowing south from farm fields would be cleaned by running
it through the marshes, where plants would absorb excess phosphorus
blamed for upsetting the Everglades ecosystem.
   ``It's very historic that everybody came to the table and agreed
to pay for this,'' said Ann Overton, a spokeswoman for the water
district. ``It's a big step forward.''
   Environmentalists involved in a 27-month effort to reach the
accord criticized the sugar industry's $40 million share as too
low.
   And the question of whether the federal government will now drop
a pollution lawsuit against the state and the water district
remained unanswered.
   The lawsuit, filed by Miami U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen,
contends water managers and the state allowed federal parks in the
region to be degraded in violation of pollution laws and signed
agreements.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Casner said
the government had no immediate comment on whether the plan was
enough of a step forward for the federal government to drop the
lawsuit.
   On Tuesday, Gov. Bob Martinez worked out and approved the
compromise, despite estimates that the cleanup could end up costing
as much as $500 million.
   ``I think the majority of the industry decided that this may be
as good as the deal was going to get. They'd better take it,'' said
Andy Rackley, vice president of the Florida Sugar Cane League.
   Under the plan, the Everglades cleanup area would be quadrupled,
with the cost split into equal $40 million shares for the state
government, the water district and sugar growers.
   ``I don't think that that necessarily represents a fair
contribution from agriculture. It may be, but there are too many
unknowns for us to be capping any contributor,'' said Doran Jason,
a member of the water district's board.
   Environmentalists agreed.
   ``You are making a statement that it is appropriate to allow an
industry that is causing a number of environmental problems to pay
something like 10 percent of the amount it will take to solve the
problems,'' said Charles Lee, executive vice president of the
Florida Audubon Society.

<TEXT>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad, an ally of
the United States against Iraq, is likely to send another 15,000
troops to help defend Saudi Arabia, Western diplomatic sources said
today.
   The Syrians have about 3,000 soldiers in Saudi Arabia and
another 1,000 in the United Arab Emirates. They are part of an
international force from some two dozen countries that includes
about 200,000 American soldiers.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who raised $12 billion
last week from the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and the Kuwaiti
regime ousted by Iraq, met with Assad to plot further cooperation
with Damascus despite U.S. accusations that Syria promotes
terrorism.
   ``The talks were frank, clear and centered on the situation in
the Gulf, the peace process in the Middle East and bilateral
issues,'' Assad spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said after the 4{-hour
session.
   He gave no other details, but the talks were believed to include
Iran's growing belligerence in the standoff.
   The additional troops probably will be accompanied by Syrian
tanks and may be transported by the Soviet Union, which also
supports the U.S. attempt to reverse Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   The Syrians will be compensated by the Saudis and other rich
Persian Gulf countries, said the sources, who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   Assad has long been at odds with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
The crisis in the gulf gives Assad a chance to confront the Iraqi
leader and gain favor with the Bush administration at the same
time.
   Assad wants the administration to join the Soviets in calling
for a Middle East peace conference with the aim of creating a
Palestinian state and forcing Israel to relinquish the Golan
Heights to Syria.
   Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Middle East war and
has annexed it. Until then, attacks on villages in northern Israel
from the Golan Heights were frequent.
   Over the last two weeks, President Bush and Baker have made a
point of saying they might support an international peace
conference at an appropriate time.
   Baker on Thursday leveled a veiled warning against Iran as he
arrived here for talks with Assad and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq
al Shara.
   Responding to a threatened ``holy war'' against U.S. forces in
Saudi Arabia, Baker said the U.S. troops were defending the Saudi
oil fields along with Arab Moslem nations.
   The threats ``obviously are of deep concern,'' Baker said as he
flew here from Moscow. ``We are not indifferent to threats against
our forces.''
   His remarks were in response to a call by the Ayatollah Ali
Khamanei, the Iranian spiritual leader, for a holy war against the
U.S. troops. It raised fears of suicide raids against the Americans
as well as questions about Iran's position in the economic war of
attrition against Saddam Hussein.
   The administration, banking on Syria and Iran's long-standing
hostility with Iraq, solicited the two countries to assist in the
anti-Iraqi campaign.
   Syria, which is on Iraq's northern border, has responded with
troops and played a leading role in the Arab League in condemning
the Iraqi invasion.
   But Iran has repaired relations with Iraq, with which it fought
an eight-year war until 1988, after endorsing the U.N. Security
Council's call for an economic boycott.
   ``We are watching it closely and believe it is holding,'' Baker
said of Iranian adherence to the sanctions ordered Aug. 2.
   Baker said interception under the sanctions of illicit cargo by
sea may be expanded to aerial enforcement.
   Baker's visit to Damascus is the first by a secretary of state
since George P. Shultz came here in June 1988 to sound out Assad on
prospects for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   The State Department has sharply criticized Syria's human rights
record and kept it on a list of seven countries accused of
sponsoring terrorism.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General
Command, which has strong ties to Syria, is suspected in the
December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland. The disaster took 280 lives.

<HEAD>Alleged Arms Supplier For Trinidad Revolt Arrested Here</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the arsenal used in a failed coup attempt
in Trinidad by Moslem extremists was purchased at gun shows and
shops throughout South Florida, says a complaint against the
alleged chief supplier.
   Louis Haneef of Pompano Beach was arrested early Thursday during
a raid on his home, said federal agents.
   The federal complaint against Haneef also includes a warrant for
the leader of the revolt, Yasin Abu Bakr, a former Trinidad
policeman who took the island nation's prime minister prisoner for
six days in July before surrendering.
   Of the 135 weapons confiscated in Trinidad after the revolt
collapsed, 105 were traced to purchases made in Florida by Haneef,
said Joe Vince, assistant special agent in charge of the Miami
office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``He was supplying the weapons that were used in the
insurrection - there is no question about it,'' the agent said.
   The arrest shows the United States will not tolerate gun
smuggling, said Miami's U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   ``We are no longer going to allow South Florida to be used as a
Mecca for people to purchase weapons to be used for narcotics
traffickers ... or people planning rebellions anywhere in the
Caribbean or in the Americas,'' Lehtinen said.
   Haneef bought at least 200 assault rifles and other firearms and
the ATF is seeking the missing guns, said Vince. He also purchased
250,000 rounds of ammunition, along with electronic equipment that
included hand-held radios.
   One key question was where Haneef obtained the approximately
$100,000 in $100 bills he used to buy the weapons in Dade and
Broward county gun shows and weapons shops, Vince said.
   Trinidad officials said Bakr and many of his men had visited
Libya and received training and money there, although they have
found no evidence Moammar Gadhafi was behind the coup attempt.
   Haneef's money was drawn on a bank in the Persian Gulf nation of
Bahrain, but its original source was still part of the
investigation, he said.
   The federal complaint, along with Haneef and Bakr, names Billaal
Abdullah, another leader of the revolt, and Riad Ali, both of whom
are also imprisoned in Trinidad.
   Haneef was originally from St. Louis, and changed his name from
Louis Cole when he became a Moslem, Vince said. He added that the
complaint would eventually be presented to a grand jury for
indictments.
   The men are accused of gun control and arms export violations,
said Vince.
   The investigation began in October 1989 when a Miami police
officer became suspicious of large gun purchases Haneef made at a
weapons show, according to an affidavit by ATF agent Thomas Bailey.
   Haneef was interviewed and said the weapons were for a gun club,
but the agency began surveillance. He ultimately bought about 200
weapons, including AK-47 and Ruger Mini-14 assault rifles,
shotguns, M-1 carbines and large-caliber pistols.
   The weapons and ammunition were allegedly smuggled out of the
United States in April aboard a freighter, hidden in hollowed-out
wall boards, Vince said. He said investigators had obtained a
warrant in hopes of placing an electronic tracer on the shipment,
but it had left port before they got there.
   The rebellion in Trinidad broke out in July when Bakr's forces
seized the Parliament House and state television, holding hostages
including Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and other government
leaders.
   They demanded Robinson's resignation, new elections and amnesty,
but eventually surrendered on the sixth day of the crisis. Bakr and
other revolt leaders are now in jail facing treason, murder and
other charges.
   Vince said he did not expect Bakr to be extradited to Miami, but
said the warrants would remain in force in any case.

   Britain will send an armored brigade of more than
120 tanks and about 6,000 combat troops to Saudi Arabia, Defense
Secretary Tom King said today.
   The move marks the first deployment of tanks and significant
numbers of ground troops by any Western country apart from the
United States since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The armored brigade will more double the British military
personnel in the Persian Gulf, and King stressed that force remains
an option for ending the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
   The defense secretary also announced that Britain would be
sending another squadron of Tornado ground attack aircraft and some
additional air defense aircraft.
   ``Our purpose in sending further forces is twofold: first to
ensure that no further aggression can possibly succeed and that the
defensive shield is sure for Saudi Arabia and the threatened Gulf
States,'' he said.
   The defense secretary said that ``while we seek the
implementation of the United Nations resolutions by peaceful means,
other options remain available and that, one way or another, he
will lose.
   ``Iraq's evil aggression must be reversed, and my announcement
today confirms our determination to play our full part in the
worldwide effort to achieve this,'' King said.
   The 7th Armored Brigade, based in West Germany, includes two
armored regiments with 120 Challenger tanks, armored infantry
battalion with Warrior armored fighting vehicles, squadron of
Scimitar combat vehicles, artillery regiment and air defense
battery with Javelin missiles, King said.
   Army units involved are Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, Queen's
Royal Irish Hussars, Staffordshire Regiment, 40 Field Regiment
Royal Artillery and squadron of Queen's Dragoon Guards.
   Defense officials indicated it would take about a month for the
armored forces to reach Saudi Arabia.
   The announcement came after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met
with senior Cabinet ministers at her 10 Downing Street office for a
final decision on the British response to U.S. urgings to NATO
countries to send ground troops.
   In addition to the Chieftain tanks, each with a crew of four and
weighing nearly 150,000 pounds, the brigade is likely to include
several light reconnaissance Scorpion tanks and dozsens of
mechanized combat vehicles.
   The British tanks, military analysts say, will need a logistics
chain separate from the American M1A1 Abrams tanks in Saudi Arabia
as part of America's Desert Shield Operation. The shells and spares
for the Abrams and the Challenger are different.
   Britain now has three squadrons of warplanes, 12 naval vessels
and ground support units involving some 3,000 military personnel in
the Gulf.
   The government gave no immediate indication of the cost of
transporting and maintaining the brigade in Gulf region. It says
the current air and naval forces cost $141 million to deploy and
are costing nearly $2 million a day to keep there.

<HEAD>Hubble Error Due to Upside-down Measuring Rod</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A worker accidentally inserted a 2-foot
metal rod upside-down in a measuring instrument while making the
Hubble Space Telescope's primary mirror, causing a flaw that
blurred the $1.5 billion scope's view, NASA officials said.
   ``This particular day, he didn't notice that the rod went in
upside-down,'' said Charles Pellerin, director of astrophysics for
NASA. ``So he made an ... error and never knew it.''
   Pellerin spoke Thursday at a news conference at Hughes Danbury
Optical Systems Inc., where a NASA investigative team had concluded
two days of meetings. The company manufactured the Hubble's primary
mirror in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Hughes Danbury was a
division of Perkin-Elmer Corp.
   There was no way the person who inserted the rod could have
known it was upside-down, said Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, who led the investigative team. Allen
declined to idenify the person.
   ``It was a technical error made by people of good will who made
a mistake,'' he said. The rod, made of the temperature-insensitive
metal invar, was used in a measuring device that guided the
polishing of the mirror, Allen said.
   Because it was inserted incorrectly, it caused a 1.3 millimeter
spacing error that led to the mirror being manufactured with a
flaw, he said.
   The flaw, called a spherical aberration, has blurred the view of
the much-acclaimed Hubble. The orbiting observatory was supposed to
take razor-sharp pictures of the outer reaches of space.
   The flaw will be corrected during a previously scheduled 1993
space shuttle mission to replace the Hubble's most powerful
instrument, the wide-field planetary camera, said Pellerin.
   It will cost an extra $15 million to build the new planetary
camera to make up for the flaw, Pellerin said. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration originally estimated the new
camera would cost up to $65 million, he said.
   Many tests could have been done to detect the error during the
manufacturing process, but Perkin-Elmer scientists and engineers
didn't do them because were under tremendous pressure to finish the
project, Allen said.
   The pressures, including cost overruns and time constraints,
distracted those working on the mirror, he said. Also, some tests
that had detected the error were considered unreliable at the time,
he said.
   ``With 20-20 hindsight, one would clearly say there was
negligence ...,'' Allen said. ``But you have to take into account
the situation that actually existed.''
   This was the investigative team's third and final visit to
Hughes Danbury, Allen said. The team will issue a final report on
their findings as soon as possible, he said.

   A 21-year-old woman has been
sentenced to die in the electric chair for the cold execution of a
drifter bound to a tree that was videotaped and shown in court.
   Deidre Hunt wept, grimaced and bowed her head as Circuit Judge
S. James Foxman imposed the death penalty Thursday.
   Hunt pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the shooting
deaths of Mark Kevin Ramsey, 19, and Bryan Chase, 18. Co-defendant
Kosta Fotopoulos, her 31-year-old former boss and lover, also was
charged with murder and was accused of videotaping Ramsey's killing
last October.
   Hunt told the judge she killed Ramsey to save her own life.
   ``I was confronted with a decision that Kosta Fotopoulos had
absolutely already made,'' she said. ``It was my decision of living
by shooting Mark Kevin Ramsey or dying with Mark Kevin Ramsey. My
decision was a choice to survive and I chose to live. ''
   The 57-second videotape, viewed last week during Hunt's six-day
sentencing hearing, shows her shooting Ramsey three times in the
chest, then grabbing him by the hair and delivering a final shot to
the head.
   Ramsey believed he was being initiated into an assassins club.
Prosecutors said Fotopoulos wanted him killed because he knew about
a counterfeit scheme Fotopoulos was invoved in.
   In a videotaped confession to police when she was arrested last
November, Hunt also admitted to taking part in a murder-for-hire
plot in which Fotopoulos' wife, Lisa, was shot in the head. Mrs.
Fotopoulos survived.
   In addition to the murder counts against her, Hunt was charged
with attempted murder and conspiracy in that attack.
   Chase, the trigger man in the attack on Mrs. Fotopoulos, was
shot to prevent exposure of the plot, authorities said.
   Hunt pleaded guilty to all charges. In addition to the death
penalty, she was sentenced to six concurrent terms of life in
prison.
   During Hunt's sentencing hearing, psychologist Clifford A. Levin
testified for the defense that she was an emotionally damaged
person who was threatened and controlled by Fotopoulos.
   Her mother and several aunts, uncles and cousins testified that
she was raped at 11 by a neighbor and was rejected by her father.

<HEAD>Playmates of Child Missing Since April Tell Secret: Victim Died in
Silo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of a 10-year-old boy was discovered in
an abandoned grain silo after his frightened playmates who
witnessed his accidental fall revealed the secret they had kept for
months.
   Just last week, a nationwide mailing campaign sent a photograph
of the missing boy, Ricky Rodriguez, to millions of homes, seeking
clues to the boy's disappearance April 26.
   But Thursday, the mother of one of Ricky's playmates called
police to say she learned what happened to Ricky.
   Ricky fell from atop a towering abandoned grain silo at the
deserted Falstaff Brewing Corp. on the city's Southeast Side while
bouncing with the other boys on conveyer belts atop the silos,
police said.
   Fearing they'd be blamed for Ricky's death, the boy's friends
kept the secret from Ricky's parents and their own families as
police used helicopters and scuba divers to search for him.
   ``They were scared. They're just little boys and they thought
they were going to get into trouble,'' police Detective Eileen
Guest said.
   ``Well, everybody can stop looking,'' Ricky's father, Steve,
said Thursday. ``I thought he was dead the night he disappeared. It
just didn't fit his pattern (to vanish). But ... I was hoping.''
   The mystery began to unravel when a sister of one of Ricky's
playmates overheard a conversation in which the boy's said Ricky
had fallen. She told her mother, who called police.
   Police interviewed each of Ricky's four playmates separately and
were convinced that the boy's death had been accidental.
   ``We're glad the case is cleared,'' said Guest. ``It's a shame
the way it concluded. But in a way, it's a relief for the family.
Now they can bury their son.''
   Ricky's picture recently had been featured in a nationwide
``Have You Seen Me?'' advertisement for missing children.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Take Up Fuel Economy Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate decided today to consider a bill
that would require automakers to improve fuel economy dramtically.
Critics said the measure would only force consumers to buy smaller
cars.
   The move opened the way for a likely vote on the measure,
probably early next week. The bill would require new cars to
achieve an average 40 miles-per-gallon fuel economy by the end of
the decade.
   A similar measure has been introduced in the House, but has yet
to emerge from committee.
   By a vote of 68-28, the Senate agreed to proceed with the
legislation and scuttled an effort by Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich.,
to prevent the bill from being introduced.
   The auto industry has vigorously opposed the legislation. It
claims the goal of a fleet fuel economy average of 40 mpg by the
year 2001, a 40 percent increase, is not achievable without forcing
consumers to buy much smaller cars.
   The vote was an indicator of the growing support in Congress for
the legislation as the Middle East crisis and rising oil prices put
renewed focus on the need for energy conservation.
   Supporters of the bill have argued that improving automobile
fuel economy to an average of 40 mpg from today's 27.5 mpg would
save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day.
   But in floor debate, Riegle said those fuel savings are not
likely to begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to
today's oil crisis would be to return to a national speed limit of
55 miles an hour.
   He reiterated many of the auto industry's arguments that the
legislation would require the manufacture of much smaller cars,
increase traffic fatalities and reduce consumer choice.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., the bill's chief sponsor, retorted
that the idea was to send a message to the automakers ``that
they're going to have to look at fuel economy and not just muscle
cars.''
   He said there is evidence that the higher fuel standards could
be met without reducing car size significantly.
   The auto industry and its unions have waged a vigorous lobbying
campaign against the measure. Riegle last week displayed 40,000
telegrams from auto workers opposed to the legislation.
   Meanwhile, environmentalists have maintained that improved auto
fuel economy is the single best way to reduce America's dependence
on foreign oil and also combat global warming through reduced
emissions of carbon dioxide.
   ``It does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we don't
start conserving now, some future president may have to consider
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the Middle
East,'' said Bryan.
   The bill would require automakers to boost the average mileage
of new car fleets by 20 percent to about 35 mpg by 1995 and about
40 percent to about 40 mpg by the year 2001.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Legislation to Forgive Part of Latin America's Debt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today sent Congress legislation
to forgive part of Latin America's debt and aides said he would
follow it by seeking authority for a free-trade pact with Mexico.
   With the Persian Gulf situation focusing attention on world oil
supplies, a free-trade pact with Mexico could help spur production
in that country. Mexico has the world's eighth-largest reserves of
oil.
   The United States already has such an agreement with Canada,
under which all tariffs and other trade barriers will be lifted by
the end of the century.
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Bush would like to have congressional agreement to begin
free-trade talks with Mexico ready when he goes to Mexico City in
November.
   In a signing ceremony at the White House, Bush said the current
attention on the Middle East does not lessen his administration's
commitment to Latin America.
   Bush has called for an eventual free-trade zone extending from
the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn. He said the legislation sent to
Capitol Hill today was an important step toward that goal.
   The legislation submitted today would forgive about $7 billion
in loans owed to the government by Latin American and Caribbean
countries.
   Latin nations owe U.S. banks an additional $48.3 billion.
   The bill also seeks to make it easier for U.S. companies to
invest in Latin America. He called the package ``trade, not aid.''
   ``We believe these measure together will boost trade, investment
and growth in our hemisphere. This legislation is good for our
neighbors, it's good for the hemisphere and I believe it is very
good for the United States,'' Bush said.
   Before the administration can begin free-trade talks with
Canada, it needs legislation from Congress authorizing it.
   Administration sources said the free trade measure could be sent
to Congress as early as next week.

   Iraqi troops forced their way into the diplomatic
compounds of France, Canada and Belgium in Kuwait this morning,
officials said.
   France said four of its citizens, including a diplomat, were
detained, but the diplomat was later released.
   The Netherlands also disclosed that Iraqi troops had forced
their way into its ambassador's residence in Kuwait earlier this
week. It said Iraq's ambassador to the Netherlands was summoned to
hear a ``sharp protest.''
   Belgian officials said three Iraqi soldiers entered Belgium's
diplomatic compound today and ordered the two remaining diplomats
to leave the embassy, officials said. The soldiers left after the
Belgian diplomats fled into the ambassador's residence, adjacent to
the embassy.
   A Belgian Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the intrusion was ``an unacceptable act going
against all international laws.''
   France vigorously protested the Iraqi action, and the European
Community called it ``intolerable.''
   NATO chief Manfred Woerner, on an official visit to Poland,
called the Iraqi incursion into the French Embassy ``another
outrageous violation of international law.''
   London and Washington said there had been no similar incidents
at its diplomatic residences or embassies in the gulf emirate.
   ``The situation hasn't changed since yesterday,'' a U.S. State
Department official said on condition of anonymity.
   West Germany's Foreign Ministry also said no incursion had taken
place at its embassy in Kuwait.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and later annexed the
oil-rich nation, Baghdad ordered embassies in Kuwait closed, saying
the nation was part of Iraqi territory.
   Iraqi troops surrounded the missions, and power and water were
cut to many in an effort to force their closure, but 17 embassies
have defied the Iraqi order.
   The staffs of more than 30 foreign missions have left since the
Aug. 24 deadline, although some insist their embassies technically
remain open.
   The French Foreign Ministry said today troops entered the
residence of the French ambassador, taking the military attache and
three others to an undisclosed location.
   The ministry said the attache was later released. It gave no
details about the fate of the other three Frenchmen.
   The Canadian Embassy in Paris said special Iraqi forces entered
the ambassador's residence before dawn. Spokesman Jacques Crete
said the consul was briefly detained but later released.
   And the Dutch Foreign Ministry disclosed that Iraqi soldiers had
forced their way into Dutch Ambassador Joop Veling's official
residence in Kuwait City earlier this week.
   In Brussels today, the European Community demanded ``the
immediate release of the abducted foreigners'' and called on Iraq
to respect the 1961 Vienna Convention on the inviolability of
diplomatic missions.
   On Thursday, the British Foreign Office summoned the Iraq
ambassador to protest what it called violations of the embassies of
France and The Netherlands, fellow members of the European
Community.
   ``There has been continual harassment,'' said the spokesman.
   Iraqi authorities had earlier cut off water and electricity to
the French Embassy in Kuwait and at one point knocked down part of
the mission's wall. The ambassador's residence and the embassy are
separate facilities.
   The French ambassador has been out of Kuwait since the invasion
and a half-dozen diplomats continue to staff the French Embassy,
headed by the charge d'affaires, Andre Janier.
   ``This is a very serious violation of the Vienna Convention,'' a
French Foreign Ministry spokesman said. ``This is a new intolerable
attack to international rights and the integrity of the person.''
   The spokesman said the Iraqi ambassador to France was summoned
immediately to hear a ``vigorous protest.''
   The Persian Gulf crisis reversed 15 years of close ties between
Iraq and France, which had been Baghdad's top Western arms supplier
and a major trading partner.
   Since the crisis began France has sent the second-largest naval
force to the region - after the United States - to help enforce
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   France has an estimated 400 nationals remaining in Iraq and
Kuwait.

   President F.W. de Klerk said
today the government may take additional steps to curb black
township fighting that has claimed about 800 lives since August.
   De Klerk promised ``strong and comprehensive'' action, but did
not elaborate. It was not immediately clear if the plan would
include harsher police measures.
   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, who met today
with de Klerk to discuss the unrest, said he expects de Klerk to
announce the new policies Monday.
   Mandela said de Klerk no longer believes the township violence
is solely a black-on-black conflict, but that ``certain faceless
elements'' are behind the attacks.
   Mandela would not specifically name who the ANC believes is
instigating the unrest, but said ``we have our own suspicions.''
   Some anti-apartheid groups have alleged rogue elements of the
security forces and white extremists are involved in the fighting.
Witnesses in several townships say masked white men participated in
recent attacks, but there has been no proof of the claims.
   De Klerk said growing violence threatens talks on power-sharing
between whites and blacks.
   ``There are forces which do not wish peaceful negotiations to
succeed. All those forces desiring peace must stand together to
identify and counter these forces,'' de Klerk said.
   ``The new South Africa, which is the goal of all sincere South
Africans, is being threatened by present events,'' he said.
   Police today said five blacks were killed and three others
injured in Soweto township in two separate attacks on mini-buses
used by commuters. Police said they were unsure whether the
violence was linked to the factional fighting or part of a dispute
among rival taxi drivers.
   The main combatants in the fighting are Zulus loyal to the
conservative Inkatha movement and Xhosas and other blacks
supporting the leftist ANC.
   Also in Soweto, demonstrators burned a delivery truck belonging
the The Star, the country's largest circulation daily newspaper.
Witnesses said the attackers were apparently upset by recent
coverage of the fighting.
   Meanwhile, the South African Chamber of Business said many
blacks have been staying away from their jobs during the recent
unrest.
   Among the topics discussed by de Klerk and Mandela in Pretoria
was a Thursday night rampage by youths with guns and machetes on a
black commuter train that left 26 dead and more than 100 injured.
   Police commanders said they did not know who the attackers were,
but two police officers at the scene said the youths were Zulus. A
conductor said he heard the youths speaking in Zulu.
   About 10 black youths, most in their late teens, boarded the
train in Johannesburg and began attacking passengers when it
started for Soweto.
   Another gang of men were waiting for the train when it pulled
into the next station and began shooting and stabbing the screaming
passengers as they tried to flee the youths on the train.
   Passengers jumped from the train or tried to hide under seats as
the youths stabbed and hacked people. The dead included old women
and men who were unable to run from the attackers.
   ``They worked their way down the coaches very systematically,
killing people. They were well organized and spoke to each other as
they attacked people,'' said one man at the station where the train
was halted.
   Hundreds of heavily armed police and army troops in battle gear
cordoned off the area. Army patrols with assault rifles walked
along railway tracks, hunting for bodies that passengers said were
hurled from the train.
   The township fighting spread from the eastern province of Natal,
where the ANC-Inkatha feud has killed about 5,000 blacks since
1986.

Toddler</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Jonathon is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The county Board of Supervisors offered a
$25,000 reward for information leading to the capture of gang
members who shot a 2-year-old boy.
   Jonathon Fabian was shot in the stomach on Tuesday as he played
in the front yard of his home in suburban Lynwood.
   The boy was in critical but stable condition today at Martin
Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center, said sheriff's Deputy Paul
Archambault. His condition was expected to improve, Archambault
said.
   Supervisor Kenneth Hahn called the shooting the ``crime of the
century'' as he introduced an emergency motion Thursday to sponsor
the reward money.
   Witnesses said three teen-age boys, one carrying a gun, ran away
after two shots were fired. Because no other gang members were seen
in the area, investigators speculated the shooting may have been
intentional.
   Lynwood Mayor Robert Henning declared it was time to ``stop
coddling murderers no matter how old they are.''
   Street-hardened officers were among those stunned by the
shooting.
   ``If gang members want to shoot each other, that's one thing,''
said sheriff's Detective Craig Ditsch. ``But it always bugs me when
I see innocent people hurt. That feeling is just magnified when
it's an innocent little boy.''

<TEXT>
   September in Nebraska hasn't sizzled like
this since 1897 but relief finally came today.
   ``I believe the heat wave is over,'' said Steve Byrd, National
Weather Service meteorologist. Some cities might hit 90 Saturday
but temperatures will be mainly in the 80s, Byrd said. ``We're
turning into more seasonable weather.''
   Schools without air conditioning had dismissed classes early
when the heat wave began Aug. 23. High school and college football
games were disrupted and farm crops and livestock threatened.
   The state's high temperature Wednesday was 99 degrees in
Chadron.
   North Platte hit 102 degrees Thursday afternoon, breaking its
record high for a Sept. 13 of 100 set in 1895, but cool breezes
helped the mercury slip to 41 overnight.
   ``This morning it was really quite chilly,'' said Sonia
Arterburn, a waitress at Roger's Fine Food restaurant in North
Platte. Moods have improved, she said, including those of her own
children.
   ``The kids are a lot easier to live with,'' she said.
   The high in Omaha had averaged 92.5 degrees during the spell,
said John Zapotocny, assistant professor of atmospheric sciences at
Creighton University. Since Sept. 1, the average high was 92
degrees and the daily mean 80.4, he said.
   The warmest September on record was in 1897, when the daily mean
was 75.2 degrees, the National Weather Service said.
   ``Unless you lived through the late 1930s, you haven't seen heat
like this in your lifetime,'' Zapotocny said.
   Red Cross workers Saturday at the University of
Nebraska-Northern Illinois football game treated 22 people for
heat-related problems. Two players suffered heat exhaustion at a
game last weekend between Nebraska Deaf High School and Kansas
Deaf.
   A week earlier, eight high school football players in Raymond
collapsed.
   Farm agents say few cattle and hogs have died, but profits could
suffer because the animals don't eat as well in sweltering weather.
   ``The hogs are not getting as fat as fast as they normally do,''
said Arnie Stuthman, president of the Nebraska Pork Producers.
   The hot weather will delay Nebraska's apple harvest by about a
week. Apple pickers stopped working before noon Tuesday because it
was too hot to work, said Sharon Durr of Carton Orchard, near
Nebraska City.
   How the heat wave affects the state's corn crop hasn't been
assessed since Sept. 1, agriculture officials say.

<HEAD>AP Board Approves 3.9 percent Rate Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of The Associated Press
has approved a general assessment increase of 3.9 percent for its
1,538 daily and weekly newspaper members and 5,800 broadcast
members, effective Jan. 20, 1991.
   William J. Keating, chairman of the AP board of directors and
chairman and publisher of The Cincinnati Enquirer, said that the
assessment increase, in percentage terms, was the lowest in three
years.
   ``Mindful of the difficult times that confront much of the
industry at this stage, the board approved a rate increase that is
well below the projected inflation rate for 1990 and 1991,''
Keating said.
   The 3.9 percent increase will not cover all of the increases and
new costs faced by AP. AP will continue to meet the growing demands
of the news industry through a vigorous cost control effort and by
increasing non-traditional revenue sources, Keating said.
   Non-traditional sources now make up 24 percent of AP's revenue.
Eleven years ago that figure was 7 percent.
   ``Of the new money that AP needs to fund 1991 operations and
continue to improve services, only 31 cents of every dollar will
come from the assessment increase,'' Keating said.
   ``It is vital to all of us that our cooperative remain strong
and able to meet the challenges in news coverage and technology,''
Keating said. ``Even as some members reduce their own activity to
absorb the impact of a difficult year in the industry, demands on
the AP grow as we look to AP to do things that, in a healthier
time, we might not have relied on AP to do.''
   The general assessment increase will be combined with another
step in the phase-in of the circulation-based newspaper formula for
those members that have not reached their appropriate assessment
level. The 1991 assessment will also reflect any circulation
changes at the member newspaper.
   The assessment increase applies to all basic services for both
newspapers and broadcasters and to all supplemental services except
for the rates for financial market tables, which are being adjusted
downward in two steps in 1990 and 1991 to reflect savings achieved
in producing computer-generated stock lists.
   AP members will receive their new weekly assessment figures by
early October, Keating said.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Dallas police chief Mack Vines entered an
innocent plea to a perjury charge today, telling reporters he was
taken aback by his abrupt firing after his indictment this week.
   ``I felt that we were going along well and mending bridges and
building new bridges,'' Vines said before his arraignment in Dallas
County Criminal Court today.
   ``The fact is I'm not guilty,'' Vines said.
   Vines, who was fired two hours after he was indicted Wednesday,
was released on his own recognizance and faces a pre-trial hearing
Sept. 28. State District Court Judge Joe Kendall said he would
probably move the trial out of Dallas.
   ``Frankly, Chief, I don't believe that you can get a fair trial
in this town,'' Kendall said, adding that he doesn't usually move a
trial on his own, but felt obligated to because of extensive
publicity over the case.
   The misdemeanor charge alleges that Vines lied to a panel
investigating the firing of a police officer about a conversation
he had with his assistant, Greg Holliday, on Aug. 2.
   The grand jury rejected the district attorney's recommendation
that Vines be indicted on seven felony perjury counts for other
statements made to the same panel. The police officer was fired
after he shot an unarmed Mexican national; the dismissal was later
ruled unjustified.
   Holliday said Vines called him late at night and tried to
influence Holliday's testimony before the special panel, which he
was scheduled to give the next day. Holliday told City Manager Jan
Hart of the conversation and she suspended both men with pay.
Holliday later was reinstated.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today upheld most
provisions of a gun control law that had been challenged by the
National Rifle Association, but struck down two record-keeping
rules.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld regulations
requiring that licensed gun dealers sell guns only from shops or a
sponsored gun show. It also upheld a rule that gun dealers keep
records on the sale of firearms from their personal collections as
well as from their businesses.
   The NRA had challenged the regulations, which were issued by the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to implement the Firearms
Owners Protection Act of 1986. Six other gun associations, a gun
show promoter and a gunsmith joined the lawsuit filed in U.S.
District Court in Charleston, S.C.
   In August 1989, the district court judge, Solomon Blatt Jr.,
upheld all but one provision of the act. The NRA filed an appeal to
overturn the remainder.
   The three-judge appeals panel agreed with the gun interests that
the regulations went too far in requiring gun owners to record
dealers' license numbers during a sale.
   The court also struck down a regulation requiring gun collectors
to keep records of curios and relics in their possession before
they get a collector's license.

   ``The release is out of humanitarian considerations,'' said one
official at the Justice Ministry, who asked not to be identified in
keeping with official practice. The official said Moon will be free
for ``several days.''
   Moon, a Presbyterian minister, was convicted of making an
illegal trip to communist North Korea in 1989 and was sentenced to
seven years in prison.
   No South Koreans can visit North Korea without prior government
approval.

<HEAD>Ad Leads Police to Oscar Stolen 15 Years Ago</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Academy Award statuette that cinematographer
Karl Freund won in 1937 is being returned to his family 15 years
after it was stolen, police said.
   The Oscar was handed over to police Thursday after a
businesswoman advertised it for sale in the Los Angeles Times.
   The unidentified woman told police she got the Oscar from a
friend who owed her money. She asked $20,000 for it in her Aug. 29
ad.
   The statuette was stolen from the Chicago home of Freund's
daughter and son-in-law in 1975. Police said a friend on the West
Coast saw the ad and contacted the family.
   No charges were filed against the woman.
   ``She had no idea it was stolen,'' said police Sgt. Donald
Cowen.
   Freund, who died in 1969, worked on such films as ``Dracula'';
``Key Largo,'' with Humphrey Bogart; and ``Camille,'' with Greta
Garbo. He also was director of photography for television's ``I
Love Lucy'' in the early 1950s.
   He won the Oscar for ``The Good Earth.''

   An Aeroflot passenger jet crashed while preparing
to land Friday in the Ural Mountains city of Sverdlovsk, killing at
least four of the 124 people on board, the Tass news agency
reported.
   Also Friday, another jet was forced to make an emergency landing
in a swamp after an engine failure, Tass said. There were no
injuries.
   Tass said engine failure also was the apparent cause of the
Aeroflot crash. It said four people died and several passengers
were injured when the Yak-42 went down as it approached Koltsovo
airport at Sverdlovsk, 930 miles east of Moscow. It was on a flight
from Volgograd.
   Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian federation, announced
the incident to the republic's Supreme Soviet parliament. He said
the plane crashed about 90 seconds before it was to touch down at
the airport.
   Yeltsin said an investigation team was dispatched to the crash
site.
   Tass said several of the injured were hospitalized.
   In the second incident, Tass said the crew of an Antonov-2
aircraft was on an aerial photography mission in the Vologda
region, 200 miles northeast of Moscow, when engine failure forced
it to land in a swamp.
   Although the single-engine aircraft nosed over, there were no
injuries to the crew, Tass said.

<HEAD>FDA Urges Eggs Be Well-Cooked To Avoid Salmonella</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is urging
that people cook their eggs well to prevent the spread of
potentially fatal food contamination caused by salmonella bacteria.
   Cooks who use raw eggs for Caesar salads, bearnaise sauce,
eggnog and ice cream risk serious food poisoning, the FDA said.
   The agency, in 3,500 notices sent to state and local food
regulatory agencies, recommended that intact-shell eggs be
redesignated as a ``potentially hazardous food'' because of
increases in illnesses linked to consumption of egg products.
   FDA spokesman Chris Lecos said today the designation ``doesn't
imply that a food is inherently unhealthful,'' only that
precautions are needed in storing and cooking it.
   The notice advises that eggs be refrigerated at temperatures of
45 degreesfahrenheit or less and thoroughly cooked at 140 degrees
fahrenheit.
   It says whole eggs should be cooked until the white is
completely coagulated and firm and the yolk begins to thicken.
Scrambled eggs need to be cooked until firm throughout.
   Restaurants and food service operations are told not to use raw
eggs in uncooked, ready-to-eat menu items and cooks are urged to
substitute pasteurized eggs and egg products for shell eggs in
recipes for salads, sauces, mayonnaise and ice cream calling for
raw eggs.
   Department of Agriculture figures show there were 6,604
illnesses and 43 deaths attributed to salmonella enteritidis
bacteria between January 1985 and October last year. Eggs were
implicated in 73 percent of 189 recorded outbreaks.
   USDA spokeswoman Margaret Webb said 56 salmonella outbreaks have
been confirmed since February this year, with 22 definitely linked
to eggs. She said eggs may also be implicated in other cases, which
have centered in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states.
   Pennsylvania has reported nine outbreaks of the illness, which
can cause vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps and can be fatal to
the elderly and young children.
   Ms. Webb said the USDA is trying to pinpoint infection in
breeder flocks - the chickens producing commercial hens. She said
one flock in Maryland, one in Alabama and four in Pennsylvania had
been restricted during the current campaign.
   Last May, the FDA approved irradiation of poultry to control
salmonella, but the industry said it had no plans to use the
procedure.
   Cathy McCharen, vice president of the Egg Nutrition Center in
Washington, said the egg industry generally supports the
recommendations.
   ``If eggs were properly refrigerated there would be no
salmonella at all,'' she said. The recommendations ``will force
food handlers and restaurateurs to treat the egg with the kind of
respect it deserves. That we do want to see.''

   According to the sources, who asked not to be identified, the
consuls were meeting to discuss the evacuation this weekend of
additional Westerners from Kuwait.
   Iraqi troops burst into ambassadors' residences or diplomatic

   Facing allegations it has been too tightfisted
during the Persian Gulf tensions, Japan on Friday pledged an
additional $3 billion for the U.S.-led military mobilization in the
region.
   The commitment includes $600 million in immediate emergency
loans to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey to ease economic problems
stemming from the trade embargo against Iraq, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Misoji Sakamoto announced.
   Japan will later decide how to disburse another $1.4 billion in
aid to Arab nations and earmark up to $1 billion more for the gulf
forces, he added.
   Last month, the Cabinet announced $1 billion for the troops
massed in Saudi Arabia following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
Japan also had pledged $22 million to help refugees in the gulf
region.
   Japan, which receives most of its oil from the Middle East, has
been rebuked by some U.S. officials who believed the nation should
contribute more to pay for the forces. Japan's postwar constitution
prohibits the country from sending troops outside its borders.
   On Wednesday, U.S. congressmen passed a resolution demanding
Japan pay all expenses of American troops based in Japan. The
proposal's sponsor, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said he thought
Japan's support for the multinational effort in the gulf was
inadequate.
   ``If they had known the magnitude of the total package of
contribution measures which we have announced today, they would
know how serious Japan is in trying to cooperate with the United
States and other countries in keeping the peace and security in
that region, even at the sacrifice of our own finances,'' said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   Watanabe also announced the first contingent of a 100-member
medical team is scheduled to be dispatched to the gulf Tuesday. The
17 officials, doctors and nurses in the first unit will look into
conditions and report back to Japan, he said.
   Sakamoto said President Bush expressed appreciation for Japan's
``active role in the international effort in the gulf.''
   He said the loans to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey could carry 1
percent annual interest and be repayable in 30 years.
   U.S. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member of the
House Armed Services Committee, hailed the action by Japan but said
she will watch Japan to ensure the contribution is ``as good as it
sounds.''
   Ms. Schroeder complained that it took congressional action to
get Japan to ``to provide a realistic contribution to the Middle
East effort.''
   The House resolution, passed 370-53, stated the United States
would withdraw 5,000 troops each year from Japan until Tokyo agrees
to pay the full cost of all 50,000 troops now stationed in the
nation. The United States spends about $4.5 billion annually for
the U.S. forces in Japan, while Japan contributes about $2.9
billion.
   Watanabe denied the resolution prompted the decision to expand
gulf aid. Japanese press reports for several days had predicted the
increase.
   Meanwhile, Japan has been considering legislation to allow
sending non-military personnel to help U.N. peacekeeping
activities. Final approval could take months.

<TEXT>
   About 100 people were evacuated from 50
threatened homes today as a wildfire burned out of control across
2,500 acres in Tuolumne County, officials said.
   The fire forced authorities to evacuate residents in the rural
Mount Provo area three miles southeast of Twain Harte, said Pat
Kaunert, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry.
   ``This fire is potentially a real dangerous one for us,''
Kaunert said. ``The fire is burning more intensely than it should,
because it is so dry.''
   ``The drought has left the vegetation just crackling dry,'' he
said.
   More than 1,300 firefighters are battling the fire, their task
made all the more difficult by the steep and difficult terrain in
the canyon. The blaze was 40 percent contained this morning.
   ``The firefighters are up against the very worst in this fire,''
Kaunert said, adding that the area is so dry that the fire is
spreading rapidly even without winds.
   U.S. Forest Service Spokeswoman Mary Hale said the fire
apparently started in a campground on the North Fork of the
Tuolumne River, within the Stanislaus National Forest west of
Yosemite National Park. The area is about 150 miles east of San
Francisco.
   Since there was no lightning in the area, it is presumed the
fire was caused by people, the forestry department said.
   Officials said they are using over 100 engines, seven air
tankers, three light helicopters and 10 bulldozers to battle the
fire.

   City Council members unanimously
agreed to settle a lawsuit charging the city with discrimination
against disabled people in building the Florida Suncoast Dome.
   Under Thursday's settlement, wheelchair seating would be
dispersed throughout the stadium, giving users the opportunity to
sit in different areas at different prices.
   The 43,000-seat stadium, built as part of the city's efforts to
lure a major league baseball franchise, opened in February with 274
wheelchair spaces on the main concourse. The lawsuit demanded 440
spaces scattered across all levels. The settlement provides for at
least 308 spaces, including spaces on all levels.
   The agreement must be approved by the U.S. District Court and
all plaintiffs involved, but lead plaintiff George Locascio
expressed his satifaction.
   ``I think it was a good settlement,'' Locascio said.
   Locascio and 13 other plaintiffs originally demanded changes
that would have added $3 million to the cost of the $138 million
stadium. The structural changes required by the settlement will
cost $600,000 to $700,000.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Sales Drop Indicates Growing Caution, Not Panic</HEAD>

   Retail sales dropped 0.6 percent in August,
the government said Friday. Analysts said the government's first
report on Americans' spending since the Persian Gulf crisis
indicated growing consumer caution - but not panic.
   Economists agreed the report was worrisome evidence of
continuing economic weakness, but said it appeared to be worse than
it really was because of the impact of the oil shock on the service
station sales and the way automobile sales are counted.
   ``If you take out gas and autos, it was down 0.1 percent,'' said
David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association.
   The Commerce Department said overall sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted $149.2 billion, down from $150.0 billion in July and the
largest decline since sales fell 1.0 percent in April.
   Auto sales fell 4.3 percent, their steepest drop since sinking
5.6 percent in January. But economists said that reflected a
seasonal adjustment and that actual sales were virtually unchanged
from both June and July.
   Excluding automobile sales, retail sales rose 0.4 percent in
August.
   On the other hand, sales at gasoline stations jumped 6.4
percent, the largest increase since a 8.3 percent gain in August
1979.
   But analysts said the sharp hike reflected sharply higher prices
rather than increased volume. The American Petroleum Institute said
gasoline prices have risen 20 percent since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Nevertheless, sales would have fallen 1.1 percent without the
service station category.
   ``The simple reality is that consumers are gradually pulling
back in their spending out of concern over a weakening job market
and unstable conditions in the Middle East,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York government
securities dealer.
   ``There's no indication that will stop in the coming months,''
Jones added. ``I think the economy is slowly sinking into a
recession.''
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Co.
in Chicago, contended that consumers are ``not showing signs of
panicking'' although they are ``talking one thing and doing
another. ...''
   Analysts are worried about the impact of Middle East
developments on Americans' spending. Two major surveys - one
conducted by the Conference Board in New York and another by the
University of Michigan - showed that consumer confidence plummeted
after the Iraq invasion.
   Because consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, there was concern that a dropoff could help push
the nation into a recession. Retail sales account for about half of
all consumer spending.
   Sales of durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last more
than three years - slid 2.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent in the
preceding month.
   Besides automobiles, the building material component also fell,
down 2.4 percent. Sales of furniture and other home furnishings
rose 0.7 percent.
   Non-durable goods sales rose 0.6 percent following July's 0.3
percent gain.
   Except for gasoline, all non-durable categories fell.
   Sales at department stores were down 0.2 percent; grocery
stores, off 0.2 percent; clothing stores, down 0.9 percent;
restaurants and bars, off 0.7 percent, and drug stores, down 0.5
percent.

<TEXT>
   Some Iraqi soldiers defecting from
occupied Kuwait are being sent back home with food and water and
being told to convey a message that ``things are pretty good over
here,'' the U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia says.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf said he had verified ``from Americans
who were there'' some reports of defectors wandering across the
border and being taken into custody by Saudi Arabian troops. There
were also reports of Iraqis found ``dead in the desert in Kuwait
after they ran out of water.''
   Saudi officers have told of hundreds of Iraqis defecting from
the forces in Kuwait, sometimes arriving in armored personnel
carriers or other vehicles.
   But the Saudis have not provided any overall number of defectors
and have refused reporters' requests to see the turncoats or
equipment.
   In an interview at his headquarters here, Schwarzkopf said he
had no solid numbers but was sure some had abandoned their posts in
Kuwait.
   ``They wander in in twos and threes looking for water and saying
they don't want to fight,'' he said.
   ``It's my understanding that the Saudis who have been handling
this problem say, `we agree, you shouldn't be fighting. Here's some
food. Here's some water. Go back and tell your folks that things
are pretty good over here.'''
   Saudi military officials were not immediately available to
comment on the report of the returned defectors.
   ``It's not huge figures - yet,'' Schwarzkopf said of the
defections. ``But I fully hope that the forces that are in Kuwait
fully understand that Saddam Hussein has put them there to die.''
   Some defectors, including those carrying useful military
intelligence, remain in Saudi Arabia, he said. None has been shown
to reporters.
   Schwarzkopf said information from the Iraqi forces indicated
Saddam's soldiers didn't know the Aug. 2 move into Kuwait was to
take over the country by force. ``They're still quite shocked by
the fact that the Kuwaitis fought them,'' he said.
   Many thought they were going on maneuvers in Kuwait, that the
Kuwaiti government had asked them to protect it, or that they were
going to fight Israelis, he said.
   The four-star general said he could not assess the overall
morale of the Iraqis.
   ``A lot of that depends on theirleadership, what kind of
resupply they have, and we just don't have that lever of detailed
intelligence,'' he said.
   Diplomats and Western military analysts in Baghdad several days
ago reported morale problems among Iraqi troops in Kuwait because
the army could not supply them with enough water and good food.
   They have also said some Iraqi officers were executed for
opposing the invasion. Unconfirmed reports from Iraqi dissidents
said as many as 120 officers had been shot by firing squad and
others imprisoned.

<HEAD>GOP Plan Would Hike Taxes On Lower Income Levels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Republican deficit-reduction plan being
considered by budget negotiators would raise taxes for people
making less than $50,000 a year but cut them for richer Americans,
congressional analysts say.
   The proposal would mean $4.1 billion a year in new taxes for
people with annual incomes under $50,000. Those at or above $50,000
would get an $11 billion tax reduction.
   Disclosure of the analysis of the proposal - which includes
limits on deductions for state and local income taxes, increased
levies on alcoholic beverages and a cut in the capital gains tax -
drew angry criticism today from GOP negotiators.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas questioned whether
there is any reason to go on with negotiations when some Democrats
``continue to fax and leak and fax stuff to reporters all day long
with their point of view.''
   Dole said the morning news was filled with reports that
``Republicans are out there trying to favor the rich.''
   ``That's the same old Democratic lie that's been out here for
20, 30, 40 years,'' Dole said.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the leaks part of a
``systematic strategy to take the tough components of any package
and blame Republicans for those components.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, also condemnned
the leaking of information from the talks. ``It is unfortunate. It
has occurred on both sides. It ought to stop,'' he told the Senate.
   As negotiators headed toward nearby Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,
for another session, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., told reporters,
``We're nowhere.''
   ``It's going to be a long process,'' said Sen. James Sasser,
D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. .
   Negotiators are racing to beat an Oct. 1 deadline. Unless a
deficit-cutting plan is approved by then, about $100 billion of
across-the-board reductions in federal programs will be triggered
two weeks later.
   Analysts for the non-partisan staff of the Joint Committee on
Taxation said the Republican proposal would produce an average 5.5
percent tax cut for the 740,000 couples and individuals with annual
incomes of $200,000 and more. The 33 million people with incomes
under $10,000 would pay an average 2.6 percent more.
   The plan is tilted in favor of those with higher incomes
primarily because of the cut in taxes on capital gains, which are
profits from the sale of investments. Analysts say nearly 80
percent of the benefits of cutting the capital gains tax would go
to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   President Bush insists on including a capital gains cut in any
deficit-reduction plan, saying it is needed for economic growth.
Democratic leaders say they will not allow the cut unless overall
income tax rates on the wealthy are raised to make up for the
capital gains reduction.
   Tax provisions offered by Democratic negotiators include a 20
percent surtax on those with annual incomes above $500,000;
elimination of the $51,300 limit on the amount of wages subject to
the 1.45 percent Medicare tax; higher taxes on alcohol; an
11-cent-a-gallon boost in gasoline taxes and a 4 percent tax on
other forms of energy.
   Congressional analysts said the Democratic plan would result in
a $4 billion tax cut for those making less than $20,000 a year and
an increase of $26.5 billion for others. A family making about
$45,000 would pay 3.2 percent more; a $250,000 family would pay 6.7
percent more.
   Despite months of talking, the White House and congressional
leaders have reached final agreement on no specific tax increase or
spending reduction. They have agreed generally on the need for
reducing the deficit by $50 billion in fiscal 1991 and an
additional $450 billion in the following four years.
   The lack of agreement among the deficit negotiators prompted the
House on Thursday to delay consideration of the $283 billion
defense bill until next week. The delay was intended ``to give our
negotiators a little opportunity,'' said House Speaker Thomas
Foley, D-Wash.
   While the negotiations drone on, the administration is preparing
for the worst. Federal workers have been notified they could be
furloughed for 22 days without pay during the next 12 months, and
administrators are going public with a message that government
services will be pinched.
   At a news conference Thursday, Federal Aviation Administration
chief James B. Busey said lack of agreement could cause a 30
percent reduction in domestic airline flights.
   Forced furloughs of FAA workers, including 17,200 air traffic
controllers, would result in a 25 percent reduction in the agency's
work force, Busey said. For safety reasons, that would result in a
cut of 25 percent to 30 percent in flights.
   ``It's not a game of chicken that I'm playing,'' Busey said.
``It's a game of management.''

<TEXT>
   Samuel S. Stratton, a New York Democrat who
served in the House for 30 years, has died of a heart attack. He
was 73.
   Stratton died Thursday after being stricken at the Potomac
nursing home where he had lived since last year. He announced in
July 1988 that he was too ill to seek re-election.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo praised Stratton for his ``dedication
and tireless leadership,'' saying he ``displayed wisdom and the
unstinting willingness to serve.''
   Other colleagues remembered him Friday as a champion of a strong
national defense and an unflagging public servant.
   ``Sam was the epitome of what a congressman should be,'' said
Republican Rep. Frank Horton, who succeeded Stratton as dean of the
New York congressional delegation. ``He was quick to respond to the
needs of his constituents and his knwledge and integrity earned
him the respect of both Republicans and Democrats alike.''
   A Democrat whose hawkish views broke with party tradition,
Stratton favored most proposed increases in defense spending and
new weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, MX missile and
neutron bomb.
   But he considered himself a middle-of-the-road Democrat, and had
voted against an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution and
supported such ``liberal'' causes as a national minimum welfare
payment and economic sanctions against South Africa.
   Stratton's biggest congressional defeat was in never becoming
chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He was passed over for
the younger and less-senior Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   Stratton was born in 1916 in Yonkers, N.Y. He graduated from the
University of Rochester and earned master's degrees from Haverford
College and Harvard University.
   He served during World War II as a naval combat intelligence
officer on the staff of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. He twice was
awarded the Bronze Star.
   Stratton was first elected to the House in 1958, the only
Democrat in 42 years to be sent to Congress from what was then the
32nd congressional district.
   Stratton is survived by his wife, Joan, and five children.

<HEAD>Constitutional Committee Rules Against Gorbachev on Rallies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A constitutional committee overturned a decree
issued by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that gave the Soviet
government power over rallies in central Moscow, Tass reported
Friday.
   The Constitutional Compliance Committee ruled that Gorbachev's
decree was unconstitutional because it ``narrowed'' the powers of
the Russian Republic - of which Moscow is capital - and the Moscow
City Council, Tass said.
   Gorbachev's decree had empowered the Soviet government to decide
whether rallies could be held within the Garden Ring Road, a wide
boulevard that circles central Moscow. Previously, Soviet
legislation gave final say over rallies to parliaments in the
republics and local governing councils, Tass said.
   Tass did not say when the constitutional committee made its
decision.
   Gorbachev's decree was issued in April after newly elected
democratic reformers took control of the Moscow City Council. In
February, the national parliament had asked the government to
oversee rallies in Moscow, fearing that extremists and criminal
elements would exploit the demonstrations to destabilize society.
   There have been several big rallies in Moscow this year drawing
thousands of people shouting for the downfall of communism.

<HEAD>Bush Readying Bill to Allow Lowering of Barriers with Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush sent Congress a bill Friday to
forgive some Latin American debt and to encourage more U.S.
companies to invest there. Aides said he also was readying a bill
to allow the lowering of trade barriers with Mexico.
   The Mexican free-trade measure could be submitted as early as
Monday, wen administration trade officials testify before the
House-Senate Joint Economic Committee, sources said.
   Bush would like to have the authority to lower trade barriers
with Mexico in hand when he meets with President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari in Mexico City in November, said officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, in focusing attention on world oil
supplies, has added to the impetus for such an agreement with
Mexico, the officials said.
   Mexico has the world's eighth largest oil reserves. A free-trade
pact with the United States could spur oil production.
   The United States already has a free-trade pact with Canada and
Bush has voiced the hope that some day goods and services may be
traded from Alaska to Argentina without trade barriers.
   He repeated that goal Friday at a White House ceremony as he
announced he was sending Congress a proposed ``Enterprise for the
Americas Initiative Act of 1990.'' Bush called the package ``trade,
not aid.''
   The legislation submitted would forgive about $7 billion in
loans owed to the government by Latin American and Caribbean
countries. Latin nations owe U.S. banks an additional $48.3
billion.
   The bill also would set up a special fund within the
Inter-American Development Bank to provide a variety of services to
western companies wanting to invest in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
   The U.S. government would contribute $500 million a year to the
fund and would seek contributions from other countries.
   ``We believe these measures together will boost trade,
investment and growth in our hemisphere. This legislation is good
for our neighbors, it's good for the hemisphere and I believe it is
very good for the United States,'' Bush said.
   Under the free-trade pact with Canada, tariffs, quotas and other
trade barriers began to fall in January 1989 and will be removed by
the turn of the century.
   Mexico is the United States' third largest trading partner,
after Canada and Japan. The United States exported $24.97 billion
in goods to Mexico last year and received $27.19 in imports, for a
deficit of $2.2 billion.

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Friday on the White House lawn:
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I just want to say a couple of things here
and I'd be glad to take just a handful of questions.
   First, I want to publicly acknowledge and express my
appreciation for the decision by the Japanese government to make
additional contributions to the effort that we're all making in the
Gulf.
   Specifically, Japan will be providing significant economic
assistance to key countries in the region that are most severely
affected by the sanctions and higher energy prices. Japan is also
increasing its support for the multinational forces involved in the
collective defense effort.
   And I gave my personal thanks to Prime Minister Kaifu last night
when he called me to tell me about this news. And we are grateful
to the Japanese - significant contribution.
   And second and in a similar vein, I want to say that early this
morning, Prime Minister Thatcher phoned to give me the additional
good news of her country's latest contribution.
   She informed me that the United Kingdom would be sending a full
armored brigade, along with the additional helicopters and
aircraft, to Saudi Arabia. Some Americans may remember the name the
``Desert Rats,'' and that's who's - that's who will be going.
   As I told the Prime Minister over the phone, given all that the
United Kingdom is already doing, this truly comes as the icing on
the cake, a significant move by the Brits.
   And I also called President Mitterrand a few minutes ago to
consult with him on the outrageous Iraqi break-in of the French
embassy residence in Kuwait.
   These developments not only underscore the brutal behavior of
Iraq, but also the international support that exists and is
marshaled against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   I've often said that it is not the United States against Iraq,
but Iraq against the world. And for our part, we will continue to
do everything possible to ensure that the sanctions work as
intended and to deter and if need be, defend Saudi Arabia against
armed attack.

   Iraqi troops burst into diplomatic compounds of France, Canada
and Belgium in Kuwait today, officials said, and sources said
consuls from the United States and four other countries were
briefly detained.
   Also, Pentagon sources said a U.S. Navy frigate ship fired on
and halted an Iraqi tanker today in the Gulf Oman as part of the
effort to enforce trade sanctions against Iraq. The tanker was then
boarded by U.S. forces, one official said.
   The incidents in Kuwait were the most serious confrontations
involving diplomats in the occupied emirate since Iraq ordered the
embassies closed.
   However, the official Iraqi News Agency, quoting what it called
a ``responsible Iraqi source,'' denied Iraqi troops had made any
incursions into what it called ``former diplomatic missions in the
province of Kuwait.'' It said troops were under strict orders not
to enter the compounds.
   Iraq annexed Kuwait six days after the Aug. 2 invasion and says
since Kuwait is no longer a sovereign country, foreign nations are
not entitled to diplomatic representation there.
   At the White House, President Bush confirmed the ship boarding
incident. Asked whether it represented an escalation in the crisis,
he said: ``I wouldn't put it closer to a war situation.''
   It was not immediately known where the ship was heading or what
its cargo was.
   On the raids on diplomatic compounds in Kuwait, Canadian
diplomatic sources in Washington said the Iraqi troops who invaded
the Canadian ambassador's residence detained the U.S. consul, along
with consuls from Britain, Ireland, Australia and Canada.
   According to the sources, who asked not to be identified, the
consuls were meeting to discuss the evacuation this weekend of
additional Westerners from Kuwait.
   Also, the Netherlands disclosed that Iraqi troops had forced
their way into its ambassador's residence in Kuwait on Wednesday.
   The countries involved protested vigorously, as did the European
Community.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, on a visit to
Czechoslovakia, called said the Iraqi move was ``an aggression, and
we will respond to it.'' He called an emergency Cabinet meeting for
Saturday.
   Meanwhile, the military noose around Iraq tightened today, with
Britain announcing it would send an armored brigade of more than
120 tanks and 6,000 combat troops to the Persian Gulf.
   It was the the first dispatch of tanks and significant numbers
of ground troops by any Western country besides the United States
since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and subsequent annexation of
the oil-rich nation.
   The economic embargo on Iraq also expanded. The United Nations
late Thursday set strict limits on food shipments to Iraq under a
U.N. embargo.
   Japan today pledged $3 billion more in aid to the multinational
force in the Persian Gulf and to nations hurt by the U.N. embargo,
bringing that country's total contribution to about $4 billion. The
United States said it welcomed the contribution.
   In the gulf region, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chief of
Staff, Gen. Colin Powell, warned Saddam Hussein today that he would
pay dearly if he attacked Saudi Arabia. He spoke to sailors aboard
the USS Blue Ridge.
   In Washington, the government announced that U.S. wholesale
prices shot up 1.3 percent in August, the biggest surge in seven
months, as the first shock wave from the Persian Gulf crisis hit
the American economy.
   The Labor Department blamed virtually the entire increase on
higher oil costs since the Middle East crisis began.
   The French Foreign Ministry in Paris said Iraqi troops entered
the ambassador's residence this morning, taking away the military
attache and three others to an unknown destination. It said the
attache was later freed but the fate of the others was not known.
   The Canadian Embassy in Paris said special Iraqi forces also
entered the residence of Canada's ambassador before dawn. Spokesman
Jacques Crete said the consul was briefly detained but later
released.
   Belgian officials said three Iraqi soldiers entered Belgium's
diplomatic compound today and ordered the two remaining diplomats
to leave the embassy. They said the soldiers left after the Belgian
diplomats fled into the adjacent ambassador's residence.
   The Dutch Foreign Ministry disclosed that Iraqi soldiers had
forced their way into Dutch Ambassador Joop Veling's home im Kuwait
City earlier this week. The ministry spokesman did not provide
further details.
   Britain's Foreign Office and the U.S. State Department said
there had been no similar action at the British and U.S. embassies
or diplomatic residences.
   Iraqi authorities had earlier cut off water and electricity to
the French and other embassies in Kuwait in an effort to pressure
foreign nations to close their missions. France, the United States
and 18 other countries have refused.
   France was one of Baghdad's top arms supplier before the gulf
crisis began, but has sent the second-largest naval force to the
region - after the United States - to help enforce U.N. sanctions
against Iraq.
   The military buildup got a boost today with the announcment by
British Defense Secretary Tom King that an armored brigade and
troops would be sent to the gulf. King said another squadron of
Tornado ground attack aircraft and additional air defense aircraft,
would also be sent.
   Defense officials indicated it would take about a month for the
armored forces to reach Saudi Arabia.
   Meanwhile, U.S. diplomatic efforts to isolate Iraq forged ahead
today. Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Syrian
President Hafez Assad to plan further cooperation with Damascus
despite a State Department report that Syria promotes terrorism.
   Assad was likely to send 15,000 more troops to help defend Saudi
Arabia, Western diplomatic sources said today on condition of
anonymity. Syria has 3,000 soldiers in Saudi Arabia and 1,000 in
the United Arab Emirates as part of the multinational force.
   Also today, an Iraqi Airways Boeing 747 chartered by the U.S.
government flew to Kuwait City to pick up about 400 Americans
scheduled to fly home later in the day, a U.S. Embassy official
said.
   The Americans were to stop in Baghdad to receive exit visas
before changing planes and continuing to London, the diplomat said
on condition of anonymity. About 6,500 Westerners remain stranded
in Iraq and Kuwait, many of them in hiding. They are believed to
include about 1,500 Americans in Kuwait, according to the U.S.
Embassy official in Baghdad.
   The Bush administration is to ask Congress today for an
additional $1.8 billion to pay for U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf
through the end of the month, administration and congressional
sources said Thursday.
   About 145,000 U.S. military personnel have been deployed in the
region since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent his forces into
Kuwait in a dispute over oil, land and money.
   Iraq has massed an estimated 265,000 troops in or near the
emirate on Saudi Arabia's northern border.
   In a late-night session Thursday, the U.N. Security Council
voted 13-2 on the U.S.-sponsored resolution to allow shipments only
to alleviate ``human suffering.'' It rejected an effort by Cuba to
broaden food shipments to civilians in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The Security Council said humanitarian organizations must
distribute whatever aid is sent, and it reserved the power to make
that determination. Cuba and Yemen voted against the measure.
   Early today, the council's committee on sanctions approved a
request by India to send a ship loaded with 11,000 tons of food to
Kuwait to feed about 120,000 stranded Indian citizens.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering,
said the vote was in line with the strict limits set Thursday. The
limits came under the U.N. Aug. 6 embargo, which cut trade with
Iraq and Kuwait to medical supplies or ``in humanitarian
circumstances, foodstuffs.''
   Japan's announcment that t would provide more aid for the
multinational forces and to gulf nations hurt by the blockade came
after members of the U.S. Congress complained Japan and Germany
were not enough in the crisis.
   Both nations are heavily dependent on Middle East oil.
   A government spokesman in Bonn said today West Germany will
offer the United States extra help in its military operation in the
Gulf, although he did not say what that aid might include.

<TEXT>
   And here I just want to reiterate what I said when I first
ordered the U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia, namely, that the United
States forces were sent to Saudi Arabia at the request of the Saudi
government. And those same U.S. forces will depart as soon as they
are no longer needed or wanted. And they will remain not one day
longer than is absolutely necessary. John?
   Q: Mr. President, are we any closer to armed combat because of
what has happened at the French embassy and also because a U.S.
warship apparently has now fired across the bow of an Iraqi tanker?
What do you know about that?
   A: I wouldn't put it closer to a war situation. I still hope
that this matter can be peacefully resolved. And the way for that
to happen is for Iraq to comply with the sanctions.
   Yes, an American vessel did, in accordance with the United
Nations resolutions, in accordance with the sanctions, cause
another Iraqi vessel to heave to. And it has been boarded and I
expect confidently that if it indeed is not carrying any
contraband, or anything that will violate the sanctions, it will be
permitted to go on its way.
   But it did require a bit of a warning before the captain pulled
over and permitted the boarding party to have a look. Yeah, Rita?
   Q: Mr. President, what can you tell us about the U.S. consul
that was detained in the Canadian Ambassador's house? Any protest r
any action about that?
   A: I don't have all the details about that one but again, I
would lump that into the - to the - the unacceptable action
category. I don't have the facts on that, I'd have - (aside) do you
-
   Staff: They've been released, Mr. President.
   A: They have been released. So - but any of these incidents, all
of them add up to clear violations of international law, and I
think they do raise tensions, they clearly do. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, how is Ambassador Howell? And would the U.S.
have to respond militarily if Iraq entered the United States
compound in Kuwait City?
   A: That's too hypothetical, the last part of the question. But I
have no reason to believe that Ambassador Howell - that Howell is
not in good shape. I haven't heard anything to the contrary.
   Q: How long are you going to keep him there, sir?
   A: I have not made a determination on that.
   Q: Can you tell us -
   Q: Mr. President, gasoline prices are up dramatically and
heating oil is at a record level in today's wholesale price report.
Does that send - what kind of warning signals does that send to you
about the overall economic situation related to the Gulf crisis?

<TEXT>
   Ben Smathers, whose agile legs and fast
feet helped spread the popularity of clog dancing during a 32-year
career on the Grand Ole Opry, has died. He was 61.
   The leader of the Stoney Mountain Cloggers died Thursday of
complications following open-heart surgery. He had been admitted to
Vanderbilt Hospital on Tuesday complaining of an upset stomach and
heartburn.
   Smathers, an Asheville, N.C., native, learned the dance as a
child by watching an old man do it in the mountains of western
North Carolina. A hallmark of Appalachian culture, clogging is
basically keeping the beat of the music by tapping the feet.
   In a 1986 interview, he said the key to doing the dance well was
the emotional grasp of its spirit.
   ``If you can't feel it in your heart, it has no meaning,'' he
told The Associated Press.
   His eight-member Stoney Mountain Cloggers often danced on the
Opry to fiddle tunes such as ``Black Mountain Rag'' and ``Old Joe
Clark.''
   The group had made frequent appearances with the Charlie Daniels
Band, dancing to the high-powered fiddle classic ``Orange Blossom
Special'' as a climax to each show.
   In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Smathers and his group
performed with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans at fairs, rodeos and other
appearances.
   He made six low-budget movies and performed the native folk
dance twice in New York's Carnegie Hall. He also appeared 300 times
on network TV shows.
   He suffered a heart attack in 1979 and doctors told him then he
would never dance again. He proved them wrong by returning to the
stage in six months.
   ``They don't call you home 'til your work's done,'' he said
about his recovery.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete. Survivors include his
mother, wife, three sons and three daughters.

   President Bush today condemned Iraq for its
``outrageous'' break-in of the French Embassy residence in Kuwait
City and said the episode and the brief detaining of an American
there adds up to ``clear violation of international law.''
   Bush also announced that an American naval ship had fired a
warning shot at an Iraqi ship so that it could be boarded. ``But it
required a bit of a warning,'' Bush said.
   The president said he had talked with French President Francois
Mitterrand earlier today ``to consult with him on the outrageous
Iraqi break-in of the French Embassy residence in Kuwait.''
   ``These developments not only underscore the brutal behavior of
Iraq, but also the international support that exists, and is
marshalled, against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.''
   He had less information on reports that the U.S. consul in
Kuwait was detained briefly today by Iraqi troops who invaded the
Canadian ambassador's residence in Kuwait City.
   ``I don't have all the details on that one, but again I would
lump that in to the unacceptable action category,'' he said. ``Any
of these incidents, all of them, add up to clear violations of
international law. They do raise tensions, they clearly do.''
   Bush was asked if the United States and its allies would now
seek to escalate the pressure on Iraq.
   ``When an escalation is required from me, Saddam Hussein will
know it,'' he said.
   Asked what he would do if Iraq entered the U.S. compound in
Kuwait City, Bush said, ``that's too hypothetical.''
   He said he had ``not made a determination'' on how long to keep
the U.S. embassy open in Kuwait City. It has been without
electricity and water for several weeks.
   Bush spoke with reporters on the White House lawn as he prepared
to leave Washington to spend the weekend at the presidential
retreat at Camp David, Md.
   The president said he told Mitterrand in their conversation the
United States would ``do anything I could to support whatever he
decides to do'' in response to the break-in at the ambassador's
home.
   ``We'll simply wait and see what they recommend,'' he said.
   Asked if today's events put the United States any closer to a
war with Iraq, Bush said:
   ``I wouldn't put it closer to a war situation. I still hope that
this matter can be peacefully resolved. And the way for that to
happen is for Iraq to comply with the sanctions.''
   On the boarding incident in the Persian Gulf, Bush said, ``Yes,
an American vessel did, in accordance with the United Nations
resolutions, in accordance with the sanctions, cause another Iraqi
vessel to heave-to. It has been boarded.''
   ``I expect confidently that if it is not carrying any contraband
or anything that will violate the sanctions, that it will be
permitted to go on its way. But it required a bit of a warning
before the captain pulled over and permitted the boarding party to
have a look.''
   Bush praised Japan for agreeing to increase its financial
support for the multinational effort in the Persian Gulf
confronting Iraq. And he said that British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher had vowed to send a full armored brigade and helicopters.
   He said he thanked both leaders personally for their
contribution.
   ``For our part, we will continue to do everything possible to
ensure that the sanctions work as intended and ... if need be,
defend Saudi Arabia against armed attack.''
   He said U.S. forces would leave Saudi Arabia ``as soon as they
are no longer needed or wanted. They will remain not one day longer
than is absolutely necessary.''
   Bush also said:
   -He expects the message he taped for the Iraqi people will be
delivered to Iraqi officials in Baghdad ``after getting off to a
slow start'' on Thursday when the Iraqi ambassador in Washington
refused to accept a copy.
   -The ``sudden inflation'' represented by the 1.3 percent rise in
August wholesale prices reported today by the Labor Department was
``a matter of concern, given the state of the economy.'' Still, he
said, there are sufficient petroleum supplies ``and the market
should not be going for higher prices.''
   -The budget negotiations between the White House and Congress,
under way for a week at nearby Andrews Air Force Base, were ``up
and down like a roller coaster.'' He said that administration
negotiators this morning felt ``they were closing the gap,''
although he had not talked to them since then.
   -Said he had been following some of the televised testimony of
his Supreme Court nominee, David Souter, and ``my admiration for
Judge Souter, my respect for him, is really higher. I really think
he's conducted himself extraordinarily well.''
   He said he felt questions from senators had been fair and that
Souter's line of answering ``has been masterful.''

   A: Well, I think anytime you have price inflation - sudden
inflation - it is a matter of concern given the state of the
economy. What it does is make me argue even more vociferously for a
budget agreement.
   But there are - the shortages - this speculation here - we're
talking about future market prices, we're talking about futures.
They - that speculative atmosphere belies the reality, which is
that there are sufficient petroleum products to - so that the
market should not be going for higher prices. In other words, it's
speculation, it's futures speculation. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, what's your reading on the budget agreement?
   A: Talking about - I believe you're talking about October prices
that are quoted on the crude market. Yeah?
   Q: What's your reading on the budget negotiations as the clock
ticks out?
   A: Well, kind of up and down like a roller coaster. This morning
there was a feeling - our - Dick Darman and John Sununu, Secretary
Brady felt that they were closing the gap. Last night it was a
little more pessimistic.
   So I can't tell you. I haven't talked to our negotiators in the
last two hours.
   Q: Is France going to take action as a result of the embassy
incursion? Will the United States take action as a result of that?
   A: I don't know what France is going to do, but clearly, I will
continue close consultation with Mr. Mitterrand, because I told him
I view this as a matter that is of grave concern to - to the United
States.
   It happens to be the French ambassador's residence, but it is a
matter that we look at as - that concerns everybody. And I told him
that I would do anything I could to support whatever he decides to
do. And he will be back - I found him in Czechoslovakia - and he
will be back, and I believe he has a Cabinet meeting tomorrow. So
we'll simply wait and see what they recommend.
   Q: Does that include backing them militarily?
   Q: Mr. President -
   A: Yeah, Charles?
   Q: - (inaudible) - suggesting that the Iraqis are in fact
tightening the screws in a number of areas - (inaudible) -
escalation now required from you and your allies?
   A: Well, when an escalation is required from me, Saddam Hussein
will know it.
   Q: What about the tape?
   Q: Does that -
   A: Oh, the tape? Haven't heard. I think it's there now. (Aside)
Do we know whether the tape has arrived?
   Marlin Fitzwater: It should be there tonight.
   A: It got off to a slow start with that Eagleburger hand-off,
but it should be there tonight. (Laughter.)
   Q: Mr. President, for two days -
   A: (Chuckling) It's one of the classic scenes.
   Q: Have you had a chance to see any of Judge Souter's testimony
and do you have any kind of opinion for how it's going?
   A: I've seen it and I think it's been magnificent. I haven't
seen it all, but I must confess - slight confession - and maybe
it's because our budgeteers were out at the summit doing all the
heavy lifting - I watched it for about an hour and a half yesterday
and I watched it for about 20 minutes today. And my admiration for
Judge Souter and respect for him is even higher. I really think
he's conducted himself extraordinarily well.

<HEAD>FBI Reports Sightings of Pilot Missing for Two Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI joined the search for a missing
insurance executive under indictment for theft, after two people
reported seeing him in the Virgin Islands and another sighted him
on a yacht in South Carolina.
   The state attorney general's office has been looking for Blan
Stewart, 47, since Halloween night 1988, when his airplane
disappeared near Lake Martin in central Alabama.
   Stewart, who lived in Huntsville, had radioed that he was having
engine trouble. Repeated searches of the lake by law enforcement
officers and by firms hired by Stewart's family and insurance
companies never turned up the plane or a body.
   On Tuesday, the FBI issued a fugitive warrant for Stewart and
joined the search, Agent Tom Wiseman said. In an affidavit used to
obtain the warrant, the FBI quoted two unidentified sources,
including one Huntsville resident, who said they saw Stewart in the
Virgin Islands in late November or early December 1989.
   The FBI said telephone records subpoenaed by the state attorney
general's office showed a collect call from the Virgin Islands to
Stewart's wife's home in Huntsville in March. The call came six
weeks before Sarah ``Robin'' Stewart went to court to have her
husband declared dead so she could collect on $4 million in life
insurance. A judge ruled, however, there was insufficient evidence
to declare Stewart dead.
   The FBI's affidavit said a third source, who lives in Huntsville
and knows Stewart and his family well, saw him on a yacht in
Charleston, S.C., in early April and spoke to him by name.
   Mrs. Stewart's attorney, John Heacock, said, ``We've never been
critical of law enforcement agencies doing their job,'' but ``we
have no knowledge of any such sources.''
   Don Valeska, an assistant Alabama attorney general who has
helped lead the search, has said he considered the sources
reliable.
   He said Friday there had been no new sightings and no new tips
in the case since the warrant was issued.
   At the time of Stewart's disappearance, he was awaiting trial on
charges of insurance theft involving $590,000 he collected but
allegedly failed to pass on to insurance companies writing the
policies. In addition, he faces first-degree theft charges in
Lauderdale County, where he is accused of passing a worthless check
for nearly $12,000 to a furniture plant.
   Insurance companies have posted a $100,000 reward for
information on whether he is alive or dead.

   A Soviet navy captain confirmed in a report Friday
that Iraqi servicemen were being trained at a naval base in Latvia,
whose nationalist government has raised a strong protest.
   Capt. Sergei E. Sharov, an official at the Soviet Navy Training
Center in Riga, the Latvian capital, confirmed the troops' presence
in an interview with the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   ``At present in the garrison, along with the specialists from
other countries, there are some from Iraq being trained in the ship
defense equipment service,'' Sharov said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Friday that
several dozen Iraqi ``students'' were among many foreigners,
including military cadets, studying in the Soviet Union.
   After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, some of the Iraqis left the
Soviet Union immediately, and none has arrived in the Soviet Union
to take their place, he said at a briefing. Gerasimov said the
number of Iraqi trainees was insignificant and that their contracts
expire in December.
   The training was not taken lightly by the government of Latvia,
which along with the neighboring Baltic republics of Lithuania and
Estonia is seeking independence from the Soviet Union.
   A resolution endorsed Thursday by the presidium, or Cabinet, of
the Latvian parliament protested the training of ``soldiers from
the armed forces of the aggressor-state Iraq,'' and demanded the
Soviet navy and the Baltic Military District ``immediately inform
the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia about all foreign
military personnel and their family members who are stationed in
the territory.''
   Andrejs Krastins, a vice-chairman of the Latvian parliament,
said the Iraqis were studying rockets and missiles. He said Latvian
authorities should cut off water, electricity and food to the base
if the they didn't leave.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said the report did not come as a surprise
to residents of Riga, who are accustomed to seeing military
specialists from the Middle East in the cafes and restaurants of
the Baltic port.
   The Soviet Union has trained thousands of soldiers from
socialist states and other nations to which it has sold military
weapons. The publicity over the Iraqi trainees was the latest
embarrassment for Moscow involving military ties to its longtime
ally.
   The Soviet Union condemned Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2 and has cut off arms shipments to Baghdad.
   But about 190 Soviet military advisers remain in Iraq, under
contract to train Saddam Hussein's soldiers to use and repair their
military gear. Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Tuesday
the Soviet Union has not reneged on the contract for fear that
doing so would jeopardize the 5,800 Soviet citizens still in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Q: Do you think the questioning has been fair?
   A: What I've seen so far, yeah. And they're - a senator has a
right to ask any question he wants. And what I think has been
masterful is the way Judge Souter has gone as far as he possibly
can and yet has handled it with such intellect and such a, you
know, knowledgeable manner that I don't think anybody gets the
feeling that he is improperly avoiding things. Yeah?
   Q: Sen. Dole this morning said he thinks the capital gains -
(off mike) -
   A: Listen, Sen. Dole is doing a magnificent job out there. I
don't know in what context he placed that. And I think everybody in
the summit knows of my commitment to it.
   I'm absolutely convinced that it would not even be a revenue
loser, although it's scored that way, and it is something that is
fundamentally important to the continued growth in the economy, a
growth that, frankly, is far too slow right now. So I hope it's put
into effect, but I'm not going to - kind of go beyond that.
   Q: Since last November - (off mike).
   A: Because we've got a strategy and I think it's working and I
think all our people are on the same side on this issue.
   Fitzwater: Final question.
   A: Here we are. Rita, and then I've got to go.
   Q: Mr. President, I couldn't hear what Charles asked, but did
you tell Mitterrand that you would back him with military
retaliation if that's the way he wants to go?
   A: We didn't go into the details of the backing, but I just told
him he has the full support of the United States - and he does.
   Q: Have you talked to Ambassador Howell about what he should do
if Iraqi forces -
   A: I haven't talked to Howell in the last week. Last one, John,
and then I really -
   Q: Is it different, sir, from an American - the American -
embassy being invaded, however? This is - you're -
   A: I'm not sure I'd make that distinction.
   Q: Well, are you rattling at least one saber? You talk about -
   A: No, I'm not rattling sabers. You're trying to get me to sound
like I'm rattling sabers. When I rattle a saber, the man will know
it.
   Q: But you talked about grave concern, but you also talked about
the fact that you'll pull the troops back as soon as you can. We
have - we saw a mixed signal.
   A: Oh! No, there should be no connection between those at all. I
mean, what I was trying to do was - there's been some speculation,
some of it mischievous, in the Middle East, that the United States
wants to remain there. And so what I want to do is just reiterate
what I think I said in the meeting to the Joint Session, and that
is that we want those people - all of them - out as soon as
possible.
   And so, I - that should be separated from anything I'm saying
here. I'm glad you asked - let me clarify that.
   Q: Are the Saudis getting anxious about having so many American
troops there?
   A: I haven't heard that at all, and I don't think so. I know I
would have heard it if - if that were the case. They are totally
clued in on what our plans are. So there's no - no disquiet on that
at all.
   Thank you all.

<HEAD>New Jersey Government Ethics Questioned in `Computergate' Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey state government is reeling from
what some are calling ``Computergate,'' the case of a Republican
computer hacker who allegedly pilfered confidential Democratic
files.
   The files reportedly show the Democrats used state time for
campaign work.
   It is a case that leaders of both parties declared closed in
May, when the Legislature's joint ethical committee dropped its
investigation and refused to release its findings.
   But the issue won't go away.
   Last week, Assembly Republican staff Executive Director John
Kohler quit his $95,000-a-year job after admitting he knew former
staffer Jeffrey Land had broken into Democratic computer files.
Kohler had previously denied knowledge of the actions.
   State leaders concede that Land, who resigned in March, gathered
more than 1,000 Democratic documents over 18 months. Land
reportedly handed the purloined documents over to his superiors.
State Attorney General Robert Del Tufo has launched an
investigation to determine if criminal charges will be filed.
   But the legislative committee's report, leaked to The Record of
Hackensack, also raised questions about the actions of the
Democrats.
   The pilfered documents show staff members of top Democrats used
state time and state computers to plot political campaign strategy.
The documents reportedly include lists of campaign contributors.
   Critics charge that the Legislatur's decision to probe the case
in private smacked of a coverup.
   ``This is playing out with many of the same sordid aspects of
the Watergate scandal,'' said Edward McCool, executive director of
New Jersey Common Cause, a government watchdog group. ``There is
denial, coverup, secret meetings to decide what to do next. And
there is the question of how far up it went. It seems the
Legislature thinks it is above accountability.''
   McCool said the computer breach ``was a break-in involving state
equipment by one partisan staff of another partisan staff. Just
because technology is involved makes it no less a violation. It's
the same as if a door was jimmied or a window broken.''
   ``Why didn't the Democrats prosecute?'' McCool said.
``Reasonably minded people can only speculate that it had to do
with the nature of the information that was stolen.''
   Legislative leaders deny a coverup. They initially called the
ethics panel probe an internal personnel matter and said it was
protected by the doctrine of separation of powers between the
branches of government.
   Leaders from both parties have subsequently said they would
cooperate with the attorney general's investigation. But Albert
Porroni, executive director of the non-partisan Office of
Legislative Services, told reporters that the Legislature can
withhold documents having to do with legislative activity on
pending bills.
   Democratic Assembly Speaker Joseph Doria on Monday said he was
``saddened'' by the revelations and that he is ``upset it would
have to get to that level.''
   But Doria also said he hadn't seen any of the stolen documents
and said he doesn't have ``the time or inclination to look through
1,000 documents.''
   Doria and other leaders refused further comment about what
documents should be turned over to the attorney general's office.
   Assembly Republican Minority Leader Chuck Haytaian, who
announced Kohler's resignation, said ``such conduct cannot under
any circumstances be tolerated.''
   Haytaian, who became minority leader in January, said in a
statement: ``I remain convinced that no legislator had any such
involvement or knowledge.''
   On Thursday, the ethics committee reopened its investigation and
announced it will call Land and Kohler to testify about their roles
in the incident. Land told reporters earlier in the week that he
will cooperate with the investigations. He has since refused to
comment publicly on the case. Kohler said Thursday he planned to
meet with the committee.
   Haytaian said he will call for ``clear guidelines'' to determine
the responsibilities and obligations of partisan staff members.
   However, McCool said revamping the system ``can't be solved in
the dark. This can only be solved if there is a full and public
hearing of what happened.''

   Girls have been a big part of the Boys Clubs of
America for some time. Now they're also part of the name.
   The organization has changed its title to the Boys and Girls
Clubs of America. Local chapters may still call themselves Boys
Clubs if they want, but 376 have already added girls to their
titles.
   ``Since the 1860s, clubs have been keeping pace with the
changing needs of America's youth,'' National Director Thomas Garth
said in announcing the name change Wednesday. ``The number of girls
served by clubs has doubled over the last 10 years. Today, over 30
percent of the young people in clubs are girls.''
   Of the 605 chapters across the country, 552 provide services to
boys and girls.
   The organization provides drug and alcohol prevention counseling
and career programs to about 1.54 million youths nationwide.
   It is funded by contributions from individuals, corporations and
foundations and through fund-raising events.

<HEAD>Souter Says He Hasn't Made Up His Mind on Abortion Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David Souter said today
that he has not made up his mind on the abortion rights issue and
would consider both sides if he is confirmed.
   Faced with repeated probes for his predisposition in the case of
Roe vs. Wade, Souter broke from his pattern of not commenting and
stated flatly that he didn't have a position.
   ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs.
Wade,'' Souter told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   ``I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up
my mind and I would not go on the court saying I must go one way or
I must go the other way,'' he said.
   Souter's comments came during his second day of testimony,
during which he also said he was obligated as a state official to
defend limits on the separation of church and state - but he
probably would have ruled for the opposite side had he been the
judge.
   When in the New Hampshire Attorney General's office, Souter
defended former Gov. Meldrim Thomson's order that flags be lowered
to half staff on Good Friday. He also prosecuted two Jehovah's
Witnesses for covering the state motto, ``Live Free or Die,'' on
their license tags.
   Souter told the Senate Judiciary Committee today he was
obligated to defend the state if arguments could be made, and he
maintained that he could in those cases.
   But, he acknowledged, ``If I were sitting as a judge today, I
probably would have ruled the same way'' as the one who decided the
flag-lowering order was unconstitutional.
   As for the license plate motto, he said the state did not have
``a particularly compelling interest'' in keeping its slogan
visible. The couple did not cover the numbers on the plate.
   But Souter said it was important for him to pursue the cases. He
said part of the job of upholding the Constitution was to bring
forth arguments on issues.
   President Bush, meanwhile, touted Souter twice today. He said on
the White House lawn that his nominee's performance has been
``magnificent.''
   Bush said he watched parts of the hearing Thursday and today
``and my admiration for Judge Souter - respect for him - is even
higher'' than before. He said Souter had handled the panel's
questions ``with such intellect and such a knowledgeable manner''
that no one could accuse him of evasion.
   Earlier, the president told an international gathering of
appellate judges at the White House that Souter's ``strong,
incisive, has an independent devotion to the Constitution that was
demonstrated during 12 years of distinguished service on the trial
court, the U.S. Court of Appeals and, in particular, on the Supreme
Court of his state, the New Hampshire Supreme Court.''
   Souter began his second day of testimony fielding questions
about how far courts should go in delineating new rights, and
Souter said judges needed to stick to those implied by the
Constitution.
   A judge ``has got to guard constantly against substituting his
values for the values he is sworn to uphold,'' he told Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, an anti-abortion lawmaker who quizzed the nominee
about how far some judges have expanded concepts of constitutional
rights.
   As he had the opening day, Souter preferred to speak in general
terms and avoided talking about issues, like abortion, which he may
have to rule on.
   On Thursday, committee members said they were learning about
David Souter the man, but far less than some had hoped about David
Souter the potential Supreme Court justice.
   ``I was touched by his sincerity, but I don't think I learned
what's in his mind with reference to the issues that will be before
the Supreme Court,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who
sought unsuccessfully to extract Souter's views on the 1973 ruling
that legalized abortion.
   As the committee's first day of hearings Thursday on President
Bush's nominee, the 50-year-old bachelor took pains to describe
himself as a caring and understanding man and erase his reputation
as a scholarly hermit.
   He described the many types of cases he has handled, from
volunteer work for indigents as a young lawyer fresh from Harvard
to his handling of morally vexing disputes as an appeals judge.
   In response to senators' questions, Souter shifted between legal
jargon and personal tales, the latter providing the most drama of
the afternoon.
   Metzenbaum told the nominee of testimony he heard from people
who experienced the butchery of illegal abortions before the
Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling.
   Metzenbaum then challenged Souter to discuss his personal
outlook on the matter - and the nominee shot back with a story from
nearly a quarter-century ago when he was a freshman adviser at
Harvard.
   The girlfriend of one of his charges was pregnant and was
planning a self-abortion, Souter said, and he agreed to counsel and
console her. They spent two hours together in a small room in a
dormitory, during which he advised her to do otherwise, he said.
   Souter, who throughout the day referred to the abortion rights
position as ``the other side,'' didn't make clear whether his
advice was to carry the pregnancy to term. But he said the incident
etched in his mind the consequences involved.
   Before his confirmation hearings, Souter was counseled at length
on how to handle himself. One goal was to make sure the committee
didn't think he was another Robert Bork, the staunchly conservative
nominee of President Reagan who was rejected by the Senate three
years ago.
   Souter sought to portray himself as less ideological in his
approach to the law.
   Regarding the right to privacy, he acknowledged that in some
cases, such as dealings between a husband and wife, it could be
considered a fundamental right even though it is never explicitly
mentioned in the Constitution.
   However, he diligently refused to endorse specific court rulings
on the issue because the Roe vs. Wade decision hinges on the
concept.
   Souter's testimony was expected to last at least through today
and the hearings were scheduled to continue next week. At the end
of the hearings, the committee will vote on the nomination and give
its recommendation to the full Senate for approval or rejection.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Defense to Use Medical Records in Rape Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a man charged with raping a
woman who says she has 21 personalities are being allowed to review
some of her medical records to try to prove at least one
personality consented to sex.
   Mark A. Peterson, 29, of Oshkosh, is charged with second-degree
sexual assault for allegedly having sex with the 26-year-old woman
on June 11.
   He maintains the woman consented and he was unaware she had a
mental illness. He is free on a $5,000 signature bond.
   Judge Robert Hawley of Winnebago County Circuit Court ruled
Thursday that the defense could review the woman's medical records
for the 12 months before the alleged rape.
   The district attorney may be allowed to strike things from the
records that he fears would invade the woman's privacy, pending a
review in the judge's chambers.
   Hawley denied a motion by Peterson's attorney, Edward
Salzsieder, that a psychiatrist for the defense be allowed to
examine all of the woman's medical records and psychiatric
examinations and that she be available for examination by the
psychiatrist.
   Hawley said a psychiatrist for the defense could talk to the
woman's psychiatrist, listen to courtroom testimony and examine
records already available.
   He added he would reconsider the motion, but the defense
psychiatrist would have to testify as to the need to examine the
woman.
   The judge also denied two motions by Salzsieder for dismissal of
the case. One contended the statute Peterson is charged under is
too vague; the other said evidence and testimony presented at the
preliminary examination did not support the charge.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Endorses Decade-Old Treaties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel Friday endorsed a pair of
U.S.-Soviet treaties more than a decade after the pacts aimed at
curbing nuclear weapons testing were drafted.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee took the action on an
18-0 vote, sending the two treaties to the full Senate for
ratification.
   The Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 places a limit of 150
kilotons on the size of weapons' tests and provides detailed
standards for the tests to ensure each side can accurately measure
the other's explosions.
   The Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976, drawn up
primarily to seal off possible loopholes in the TTB treaty, puts
identical limits on nuclear blasts for peaceful purposes such as
excavation or seismic exploration.
   Both treaties, which languished for years because of misgivings
over U.S. ability to verify Soviet compliance, lag far behind
current arms-control reality, which contemplates massive reductions
in each side's nuclear arsenals.
   New verification protocols agreed to June 1 by President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev during their Washington
summit have largely cleared away the misgivings.
   In fact, the protocols have in some ways become more important
than the treaties because they set up a new process of intrusive
on-site inspections by both sides - procedures that may become a
model for a sweeping strategic arms agreement.

   Mayor Sonny Bono says he's thinking
of taking his political act on the road - to Washington.
   ``If I made a move, I would decide for the Senate,'' said the
former restaurateur, singer, television star and husband of
Oscar-winning actress Cher.
   ``At this point,'' he said Thursday, ``I have to really question
whether for another four years I want to just continue being mayor

   Bono said he had talked with Sen. Pete Wilson, ``about going

   If Wilson, a Republican, wins his bid for governor, he would be
in a position to choose his own Senate replacement.
   Bono, also a Republican, returned Wednesday from a promotional

   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - George ``Spanky'' McFarland, the former
child star of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals,'' says he deserves
about $100,000 from a bar that had used a logo depicting a chubby
boy in a beanie.
   Federal Judge James Rosenbaum on Thursday ordered the saloon,
now called Checker's Nightclub and formerly Spanky's Saloon, not to
use the ``visage or name'' of Spanky. It's not enough for
McFarland.
   Drawings of a round-faced kid wearing the beanie came down from
the front of the building and from interior walls. Patrons no
longer can buy jackets, T-shirts and hats imprinted with the
Spanky's Saloon logo.
   Other businesses pay McFarland, 62, who lives in Fort Worth,
Texas, for the right to use his name and childhood face. McFarland
wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former
co-owner of the St. Paul bar.
   ``He's after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and
that's an exorbitant amount of money, even if they did something
wrong,'' said Dennis Johnson, a lawyer for the bar's former owner,
Michael Kalis.
   Kalis sold his interest in the bar to his partner, Walter
Engelhardt, in 1982.
   Johnson and Engelhardt, who represented himself in court,
contend the bar's name had little to do with its business and that
the connection with McFarland was unintentional.
   ``If every kid with a beanie on his head is him, this country is
in trouble,'' Engelhardt said last year. ``If there were actual
pictures of him here, I could understand, but not when it's just
some fat-faced kid.''
   Rosenbaum urged attorneys to work out an agreement regarding the
merchandise and took McFarland's other claims under advisement.

marrow match inspired 50,000 people to offer theirs was recovering
Friday after leaving the hospital.
   Allison Atlas, 20, was discharged from the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center's bone marrow transplant floor Thursday,
about a month after receiving marrow from her mother.
   She went to an apartment near the center that her family has
rented since they came to the area for her treatment this summer.
   ``She's at day 36 (after the transplant) today and she will not
be going home until she's at day 100'' or so, said the center's
spokeswoman, Susan Edmonds.
   It will be six months to a year before it is known if her immune
system has returned to normal.
   ``The bone marrow graft is well established and functioning
appropriately,'' said Dr. David Peace, one of Miss Atlas'
physicians. ``At this time, there is no evidence of recurrent
disease.''
   The transplant was conducted after her diseased marrow was
destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation. A nationwide search for a
perfectly matched marrow donor brought 50,000 would-be
contributors, but none were suitable for her.
   Miss Atlas, from Bethesda, Md., was a student at New York
University before she became ill.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Singer-songwriter Paul Anka and his wife are
suing their former attorney for allegedly giving bad tax and
financial advice, court documents show.
   The lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges
that Albert A. Rettig cost Paul and Anne Anka hundreds of thousands
of dollars in back taxes and fines and ``threatens to cause the
Ankas more than $600,000 in additional damages.''
   Anka's writing and recording career has spanned four decades and
includes hits such as ``Lonely Boy,'' ``Puppy Love,'' ``She's a
Lady,'' and ``My Way,'' made famous by Frank Sinatra.
   Rettig, the Anka attorney and accountant for 30 years, was fired
in June. Rettig's law and accounting associates also are named in
the suit.
   A woman who answered the phone at Rettig's Beverly Hills home
said he was out of the country and could not be reached for
comment.
   The Ankas, residents of Nevada, say that Rettig did not tell
them that they would have to pay income tax if they spend more than
nine months in California.
   In 1988, the California Franchise Tax Board, billed Anne Anka
for $400,000 in state income tax because she had spent more than
nine months in Carmel. Paul Anka is a Canadian citizen.
   The Ankas appealed following Rettig's advice and had to pay an
additional $100,000, the couple claimed in the lawsuit. Court
documents say the Ankas claim Rettig ignored letters from the state
tax board asking that he file the taxes.

   A federal appeals court ruled against a
Navajo Indian woman who sued to block a plan to move Navajos off
Hopi reservation land in Arizona.
   The court said only tribal chairmen have authority to bring such
lawsuits.
   Upholding a lower-court decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals on Thursday ruled 3-0 that Congress, in dividing the tribal
land in northeastern Arizona, authorized only chairmen to sue over
relocation procedures.
   A similar lawsuit by a Navajo tribal chairman is pending in U.S.
District Court.
   A 1974 federal law, aimed at ending a longstanding dispute over
reservation lands, required relocation of Navajos from 900,000
acres designated as Hopi land. The Hopi reservation is an island
inside the much larger Navajo reservation.
   The lawsuit by June R. Benally said the federal Navajo-Hopi
Relocation Commission had adopted inadequate or improper procedures
for relocating Navajos and awarding benefits. She sought a court
order blocking further relocation and related spending until the
procedures were changed.
   Many Navajos have criticized the commission's 1981 plan, saying
it failed to give details for such services as medical care,
sewage, electricity, employment and job training.

   A city directive ordering teachers to
curtail the traditional practice of using classroom walls as a
gallery for student drawings, essays and decorations drew fire from
parents.
   ``I think it's terrible,'' said Cindy Lawlor, who learned of the
new policy through a note home from a frustrated teacher. The
elementary school decorations lent cheer to the classrooms and gave
children a boost, she said.
   ``I have three little ones and I don't have enough room on the
refrigerator,'' she said.
   Mayor Christopher Johnson said the policy is just a matter of
fire safety.
   ``The practice of hanging decorations in certain areas of the
school has become excessive,'' he said. Johnson said some
decorations were stretched over heating vents and others hung from
the ceiling.
   The new policy says that decorations may cover no more than 20
percent of a wall. Teachers are being urged to find flame-retardant
materials for wall displays, instead of the traditional
construction paper.
   ``Unfortunately, the teachers caught wind of what was going on
at the end of last year and they've kind of taken this thing and
kind of blown it out of proportion,'' Johnson said.
   Granger Elementary School Principal Phyllis Lewis said teachers
and city officials are trying to work out a compromise.
   ``Number 1 is the kids' safety and that's Number 1 on our minds,
too,'' she said. ``Our problem is we've done so much (decorating.)
It's like going cold turkey.''
   ``Parents are coming in and saying, `Where did it all go?' Last
year for the first day of school I had 520 teddy bears on the
walls,'' Lewis said.
   Putting a limit on classroom wall decorations is an issue that
surfaces from time to time, said Philip O'Sullivan of the
Massachusetts Fire Marshal's office.
   The Life Safety Code guidelines of the National Fire Protection
Association recommends that 80 percent of the walls be left clear.
   ``We've had calls in the past about excessive use of artwork and
formal decorations,'' said O'Sullivan. ``It's something you do have
to monitor no question. You just can't let it run rampant.''

<TEXT>
   The daughter of a McDonald's Corp. executive
escaped from a 28-hour kidnapping ordeal and police said they
arrested a friend of the family who had demanded $400,000 ransom.
   Sarah Zien, 26, outwitted her abductor by persuading him to take
her to a drug store, where she managed to use a phone out of his
presence long enough to call her parents. They in turn called
police, Sgt. Bill Holmes said Thursday.
   J.C. ``Bob'' Aler, 55, of Point Loma, was arrested Wednesday by
El Cajon police in the store parking lot while apparently looking
for Zien, authorities said. He had partially disguised himself and
had a pistol in his car, police said.
   Aler, who owns Industrial Plastics Inc. in El Cajon, was being
held in county jail without bail.
   Zien's mother, Lois, said the family was shocked at Alar's
arrest because he and his wife are social friends of theirs whom
they had most recently seen two weeks ago at a dinner.
   Sarah Zien's ordeal began Tuesday morning as she walked from her
car to the downtown San Diego photographic studio where she works.
A man approached her with a note that said other members of her
family had been kidnapped and would be killed if she didn't go with
him, Lois Zien said.
   The kidnapper took Zien to an unfurnished home, where she spent
the night chained to a toilet. Meanwhile, the kidnapper began
making a series of phone calls to her parents' San Diego residence
and demanded $400,000 ransom, Police Capt. Dick Toneck said.
   Zien persuaded her abductor to take her to a drug store to fill
a prescription and said she needed to call her doctor. She called
her parents' house instead and gave them the store's phone number.
   Her parents contacted police, who immediately called the store's
pharmacy and alerted them to watch for Zien. When she arrived and
gave clerks the prescription, they locked the doors until
authorities told them Alar had been arrested.
   ``McDonald's Behind the Arches,'' a company history, credits
Zien's father, Jim, with pioneering advertising techniques used
during the early years of the corporation founded by the late Ray
Kroc.
   Sarah Zien, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Middlebury College in
Vermont, regularly takes medication for a liver ailment but doesn't
need to take it every day, her mother said.
   ``We knew that she could hang on during this and be smart and
strong, but what an experience,'' Lois Zien said.

<HEAD>Souter Says He Hasn't Made Up His Mind on Abortion Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter told
senators Friday he had not made up his mind about what stance he
would take as a justice on possible reopening of the court's 1973
abortion-legalizing ruling.
   After months of refusing to even address the question, which has
dominated speculation about his views, Souter said in answer to
questions during the second day of his Judiciary Committee
confirmation hearings:
   ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs.
Wade. ... I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not
made up my mind and I would not go on the court saying I must go
one way or I must go the other way.''
   Abortion foes have high hopes that President Bush's nominee to
replace liberal Justice William J. Brennan will provide the
critical vote to overturn the decision. Abortion-rights groups have
expressed fears that that might indeed happen.
   Also on abortion, Souter told the committee he had voted to let
such operations be performed at a hospital where he served on the
board of trustees. But he said his vote did not necessarily reflect
his moral views on abortion.
   On another topic, Souter told the senators that as a judge he
might go against some of the stands he took as New Hampshire's
attorney general in freedom-of-religion cases.
   But defended his prosecution of demonstrators who opposed the
building of the Seabrook nuclear reactor in New Hampshire.
   Meanwhile, President Bush touted his nominee at a news
conference and at a White House meeting with an international
gathering of judges.
   Bush said he had watched portions of the hearings on television,
and he called his nominee's effort ``magnificent ... masterful.''
   Souter was asked by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., about his vote
to allow abortions while on the Concord Hospital's board in the
mid-1970s. The nominee noted that legalized abortion was ``the law
of the land'' after the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe vs.
Wade.
   While indicating that some trustees might have had moral
scruples against abortion, he said, ``We did not believe it was
appropriate to impose those views on the hospital.''
   Souter attempted to distance himself from his involvement, as
state attorney general, in two freedom-of-religion controversies of
the 1970s.
   In one, he defended Gov. Meldrim Thomson's order that flags on
all state government buildings be flown at half staff on Good
Friday to commemorate Jesus Christ's death.
   In the other, he prosecuted two Jehovah's Witnesses for covering
the state motto, ``Live Free or Die,'' on their automobile license
plates.
   Noting that the flag-lowering order was struck down by a federal
judge in Boston, Souter said, ``If I were sitting as a judge today,
I probably would have ruled the same way'' as did the judge in that
case.
   And he conceded that New Hampshire's interest in the license tag
case was ``not particularly compelling.''
   An interesting exchange occurred when Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, complained about activist judges and asked Souter about
``rights created by the courts.''
   ``The Supreme Court should only act, and can only act, when it
has the judicial responsibility under ... the Constitution, but the
Supreme Court is left to act alone when the political branches do
not act beforehand,'' Souter said.
   Citing the 1954 high court decision that outlawed racial
segregation in America's public schools, he said, ``We had Brown
vs. Board of Education ... because we had no decision from any
other branch of the government, at any other level of the
government, facing the undoubted constitutional problem that had to
be solved.''
   Souter said Congress' willingness to aggressively protect the
Constitution's promise of equal protection of the law for all is
welcome ``so the court is not left in the position of seeming to be
the only guarantor of some of the very liberties that we must most
be concerned with.''
   He added: ``Judges are not the only people in our governmental
structure who are sworn to uphold the Constitution and to try to
make it work. The executive, the president of the United States,
takes such an oath. All of you take such an oath ... you are just
as much responsible for making good on the Constitution's
guarantees as we are in the judiciary.''
   Souter, who spent seven years on the New Hampshire Supreme Court
before being named a federal appeals court judge by Bush last
April, would become the Supreme Court's 105th justice if confirmed.
   The Judiciary Committee will vote on Souter's nomination after
completing its hearings sometimes next week. The nomination then
will go to the full Senate.

<HEAD>No Takers For Springfield's Water</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to bottle and sell water
from the city's reservoirs fell flat and now officials can't even
give it away.
   This week, city officials tried to donate surplus water to the
troops in Saudi Arabia but were told the military is more
interested in transporting tanks.
   ``Everybody wants to give us water,'' said Gordon Newell,
spokesman for Westover Air Force Base in Chicopee. ``One gentleman
called and offered to give us 60,000 gallons.''
   Looking for sources of cash for the city, Mayor Mary Hurley has
been promoting a plan to bottle and sell Springfield's water, which
city officials tout as pure and good-tasting.
   But no private companies have submitted bids for bottling water
from the reservoir, prompting city officials to send the matter
back to committee.
   Hurley, meanwhile, offered the water to the Air Force.
   City officials said all went well until base officials asked how
the water was packaged.
   The answer was that it came out of the tap and base officials
balked at the thought of bottling their own.
   Newell said water weighs 8.3 pounds per gallon and would be too
much even for the huge C-5A transport planes that fly out of
Westover.
   The 337th Military Air Lift Squadron at Westover has been
activated to help with the airlift of supplies to the Middle East.
   ``As far as putting huge amounts of water on we would have to
take priority cargo off,'' he said. ``There's plenty of water in
Saudi Arabia, they have desalinization plants everywhere.''
   Still, Newell said base officials appreciated the thought.

<HEAD>Tape Released With Trooper Describing Woman's Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police released a taped confession by a
state trooper accused of strangling a woman after a traffic stop in
which he called her the name of his estranged wife and asked why
she was divorcing him.
   Florida Highway Patrol trooper Timothy Harris, 32, allegedly
stopped Lorraine Hendricks of Jacksonville on an isolated section
of Interstate 95 and killed her after the two had sex on a wooded
median strip March 4.
   In a tape made the night of his arrest in April and released
Thursday, Harris told investigators Ms. Hendricks consented to
sexual intercourse but became frightened when he started calling
her Sandy, the name of his estranged wife.
   He said he went berserk and pushed her face in the sand and
straddled her back while pinning her arms to her sides with his
legs.
   ``I was trying to calm down,'' the trooper said on the tape. ``I
asked her why she was divorcing me. She said she understood I was
hurt, but that she wasn't the girl I thought she was.''
   Moments later, detectives said, Harris crushed her throat with
his bare hands, although he said he thought he had choked her with
her underwear.
   State Attorney Bruce Colton: ``When she died, Tim, was it
fast?''
   Harris: ``No.''
   Colton: ``Did that make it harder?''
   Harris: ``I wanted to stop it.''
   Colton: ``As you were doing it, you wanted to stop it?''
   Harris: ``I just couldn't stop, you know.''
   Defense attorneys are trying to suppress the tape, arguing
Harris was coerced, and Circuit Judge L.B. Vocelle has continued
the matter until Tuesday.
   In the same tape, Harris asked to be sent ``somewhere where I
can get help'' and asked for assurances he would not get the death
penalty.
   But Colton told Harris that he could make no promises, and
Assistant State Attorney Dave Morgan said Thursday that he will ask
for the death penalty when Harris stands trial next month in
Bartow.
   Attorneys for Harris are awaiting a psychiatric report on their
client before deciding whether to use an insanity defense.
   Hendricks was on her way to Fort Lauderdale to see her
6-year-old daughter when Harris stopped her for driving while
wearing headphones, according to his taped statements.
   On the tape, Harris said he was going to give her a warning
ticket, but they began talking about divorce and families.
   After the slaying, Harris said he took off the rest of her
clothes and covered her body with pine needles. He said he threw
her clothing and purse in a trash can at a rest stop.

   U.S. troops in the Middle East will soon be able
to give their families back home a vivid picture of life at the
front.
   More than $2 million of video equipment is being donated and
shipped overseas so military men and women will be able to tape and
send personal messages.
   ``We have been truly overwhelmed by corporate response to the
great need of military personnel in the Persian Gulf,'' said
Chapman Cox, president of World USO, a non-profit organization
serving more than 5 million American military families worldwide.
   The ``Better Than a Letter'' program was initiated by Montgomery
Ward &amp; Co., with help from its vendors and the World USO.
   The donation includes about 450 video cameras, 350 televisions,
370 video cassette recorders, 250,000 video tapes and video mailing
materials.
   The equipment will be shipped to the Middle East within the next
several weeks and military personnel will have free access to it.
   The program also provides postage to mail the video tapes home.
Families without a VCR can arrange a private viewing of the tape at
a local Montgomery Ward store.
   Vendors providing equipment include: Zenith, RCA, Sharp, JVC and
Magnavox. Video tapes will be donated by Maxell, Scotch, 3M, BASF
and TDK.

<HEAD>Oil Shock Sends Wholesale Inflation Soaring; Retail Sales Sink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shock waves from the Persian Gulf crisis
rippled through the economy in August as record increases in oil
prices sent wholesale inflation surging and pushed retail sales
into a nose dive.
   The Labor Department said wholesale prices were up 1.3 percent
last month, the steepest rise in seven months. Private economists
were pessimistic about future reports.
   ``The worst is yet to come,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
at the Boston Co.
   The government blamed virtually all the increase on higher oil
costs that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   A 16.9 percent increase in the price of gasoline and the 62.5
percent rise in crude petroleum were the highest one-month
increases recorded since the government began tracking those
commodities in 1947.
   Also setting a one-month record was fuel oil, which soared 38.8
percent. Kerosene, diesel fuel and residual fuels also hit new
highs.
   The fallout from the Middle East upheaval has heightened
economists' fears that higher inflationary pressures could push an
already weak U.S. economy into a recession.
   In more weak economic news, the government said industrial
production dropped 0.2 percent in August. That poor showing in
factory activity - the manufacturing sector's worst monthly
performance since April - was also linked to higher energy prices,
analysts said.
   Friday's data was the first hard evidence that the oil crisis
has indeed had a staggering effect. While private analysts only
expected inflationary pressures to worsen in coming months, the
White House tried to sound a note of calm.
   President Bush called the big jump in wholesale inflation ``a
matter of concern given the state of the economy.'' But he insisted
that energy prices had been pushed higher because of unfounded
market fears about possible shortages of supplies.
   ``The speculative atmosphere belies the reality, which is that
there are sufficient petroleum products,'' Bush said. ``The market
should not be going for higher prices.''
   Private economists were far more discouraging.
   ``The economic consequences of the Iraqi event is going to be
worse than we expected in terms of costs to the U.S. economy in
lost growth and higher inflation,'' said the Boston Co.'s Sinai.
   ``The initial round is so large, it implies that the
ripple-through effect in coming months will be quite sizable,'' he
said.
   Robert Dederick of the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago said
Friday's data on high wholesale inflation, coupled with weak
growth, indicates the Iraqi conflict threatens to push a vulnerable
U.S. economy into recession.
   ``It may well be the shock that broke the camel's back because
the back was already bending,'' Dederick said.
   August's inflation outbreak is likely to become more entrenched,
analysts said, filtering through to the thousands of plastic,
chemical and other products made with petroleum. Oil also figures
into products that must be transported long distances and shows up
in utility costs as well.
   ``It's a component that's embedded in everything. It's not
something you can hide from,'' said Peter Radford of National
Westminster Bancorp. of New York. ``It's like ripples in a pool.
You've just seen the wave in the middle and it's going to go all
the way out through the rest of the economy.''
   While wholesale inflation sped upward, a separate Commerce
Department report showed that retail sales slumped 0.6 percent,
with declines in nearly every category. That drop is worrisome,
analysts said, because consumer spending - or the lack of it -
represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   The August rise in wholesale prices was the largest since a cold
snap caused a 1.9 percent spurt in January. If the price of
finished goods rose as much as they did in August each month, it
would translate into an annual increase of 16.4 percent.
   So far this year, wholesale inflation has risen at an annual
rate of 4.6 percent, the government said.
   On Tuesday, the government will provide its first look at
inflation at the consumer level since the turmoil began in the
Middle East. That report is expected to be equally bad, given the
fact that pump prices of gasoline went up almost immediately.
   While energy costs overall rose 9.5 percent in August, food
costs were up as well, rising 0.8 percent.
   Prices for goods excluding volatile food and energy items -
often taken by economists as a better barometer of underlying
inflationary pressures - rose 0.3 percent. In July, that so-called
core rate had declined 0.1 percent for the first drop in a year.

<NOTE>EDS: Stands for AM-Gulf-Britain on News Digest.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Britain is sending the 7th Armored Brigade,
successors to the Desert Rats of World War II, to Saudi Arabia with
120 tanks and some 6,000 combat troops to bolster the multinational
force, the government said Friday.
   And Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said a squadron of 12
CF-18 jets would be sent to fly cover for three Canadian warships
en route to the gulf.
   The announcements came as NATO officials severely criticized
Iraq after its troops raided Canadian, French and Belgian
diplomatic compounds in Kuwait early Friday. The United States has
been requesting additional allied support for its buildup in the
gulf.
   British Defense Secretary Tom King said the dispatch of the
armored brigade would ensure that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
understood that if U.N. sanctions fail, ``other options remain
available and that, one way or another, he will lose.''
   ``We wish to see this settled by peaceful means,'' King said.
``But we make it absolutely clear that should it not result in the
successful removal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, then we rule out no
other option, including the military option.''
   King said Britain also will send another squadron of 12 Tornado
ground attack aircraft to join three Royal Air Force fighter
squadrons, and additional air defense aircraft.
   The British decision marked the first dispatch of tanks and
significant ground troops by a Western country besides the United
States since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   In a related development, the West German government - prevented
by its constitution from deploying forces outside the NATO area -
said it had given the United States a list of more than 50 merchant
ships that could be used to transport American troops to the Gulf.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III this week urged NATO
allies to send ground troops, even in token numbers, to symbolize
shared involvement with the military buildup.
   British officials said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decided
with her Cabinet Friday to make a more concrete show of support.
   ``The deployment of any troops is obviously political in terms
of value,'' said Ian Kemp, a military analyst at Jane's, the
defense specialist publishers. ``But an armored brigade is
militarily the most useful thing that the United Kingdom can
send.''
   The 7th Armored Brigade, based in West Germany, is the successor
of the 7th Armored Division, which fought the Italians and then
Hitler's Afrika Corp.
   The Desert Rats derived their nickname from the Libyan jerboa,
which became their emblem. Their tanks clashed in the desert with
the legendary Afrika Corp commanded by Gen. Erwin Rommel in some of
the most famous battles of World War II.
   Under the command of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, the
brigade fought a series of crucial battles at El Alamein and Sidi
Rezegh, which led to the British recapture of the port of Tobruk in
November 1942.
   Officials indicated the brigade will take at least a month to
get to Saudi Arabia in a $47 million transport operation. It will
cost about $2 million a day to keep there, doubling the pricetag of
Britain's military commitment in the gulf.
   Opinion polls show most Britons back Mrs. Thatcher's bullish
reponse to the Iraqi invasion.
   The British tanks will join a U.S. force of about 1,000 tanks
being assembled in Opertion Desert Shield.
   The brigade includes two armored regiments with 120 heavily
armored Challenger tanks, an armored infantry battalion with
Warrior armored fighting vehicles, a squadron of Scimitar combat
vehicles, an artillery regiment and an air defense battery with
Javelin missiles.

   U.S. and Australian naval frigates fired
warning shots Friday to halt an Iraqi tanker and inspect it for
cargo prohibited under the U.N. embargo against Iraq, the Pentagon
said.
   A joint boarding party from the two ships - the USS Brewton and
the HMAS Darwin - boarded the Al-Fao and ``determined the ship
contained no prohibited cargo,'' officials said.
   The vessel, halted in the Gulf of Oman, was allowed to proceed
after five hours to the Iraqi port of Basra.
   President Bush, queried about the incident at an impromptu
session with reporters at the White House, said the incident hadn't
brought the United States nearer to war with Iraq.
   ``I wouldn't put it closer to a war situation. I still hope that
this matter can be peacefully resolved. And the way for that to
happen is for Iraq to comply with the sanctions,'' Bush said.
   It was the third shooting incident in the effort to put a
stranglehold on Iraqi shipping and the second time an Iraqi ship
had been boarded in the barricade. Earlier, the Iraqi vessel
Zanoobia was boarded and diverted after it was determined to be
carrying tea, a prohibited cargo.
   On Aug. 6, four days after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the U.N.
Security Council authorized the dozens of warships gathered in the
region to use military force to uphold its sanctions.
   Bush emphasized that the action was taken ``in according with
the United Nations resolutions, in accordance with the sanctions.''
   The president said the warning shots were fired because ``it
required a bit of a warning before the captain pulled over and
permitted the boarding party to have a look.''
   In a statement, the Pentagon said the 41,400-ton tanker was
reported to have no cargo aboard.
   ``After several requests to permit boarding, the Brewton fired
the first warning shots from one of its .50-caliber machine guns,''
the Pentagon said. ``The Darwin fired a second set of warning
shots, also from a .50-caliber machine gun, about 10 minutes
later.''
   The tanker's master then announced he would stop the ship and
permit the boarding, the Pentagon said.
   ``A joint boarding party ... boarded the tanker, conducted a
coordinated investigation and determined that the ship contained no
prohibited cargo,'' the Pentagon statement said.
   The first shots in the interdiction effort were fired Aug. 18,
when U.S. Navy ships attempted to halt two Iraqi tankers. Neither
ship was boarded.
   The U.S. forces - now joined by the naval forces of several
other nations - are in the Persian Gulf region to enforce the
U.N.-imposed economic sanctions in the hope of forcing Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait.

   The sounds of war rumbled across the Saudi
Arabian desert Friday. The target: a piece of white cheesecloth 500
yards across the sand.
   It was the third day the Saudi government allowed U.S. forces to
use live ammunition to test tanks and heavy machine guns, and the
first time reporters were allowed to watch.
   ``On the way!'' bellowed the commanders from the 1st Tank
Battalion before a shell was launched toward the targets. The
ear-splitting blast from the 105mm gun shook the sand underfoot.
   Between blasts, the 50-caliber machine guns from another
battalion thundered in the background.
   The practice range in the northern Saudi Arabian desert was
about 10 miles inland from the coastal road the Marine units are
assigned to protect. Defense Department media rules prohibit
reporting exact locations or mention of specific numbers of troops
and weapons.
   Lt. Col. Mike Kephart, commander of the tank battalion, said the
live-fire tests helped build confidence and boost morale.
   ``Any time they fire a gun, feel the recoil of the tank, smell
the gunpowder, they are motivated,'' said Kephart of Bremerton,
Wash.
   The tests were used to calibrate the gunsights of the tanks and
machine guns, which have been in storage for up to two years aboard
the Marines' Mobile Prepositioning ships stationed in the western
Pacific.
   The men, stationed at Camp Pendleton, Calif., have been in Saudi
Arabia for about 10 days preparing the equipment.
   ``It's like hunting deer,'' said Staff Sgt. Scott Rice, 30, of
Fallbrook, Calif.
   Kephart said there had been no problems with the equipment and
that few tanks required adjustments.
   Marines said their older M-60 tanks lack thermal gunsights and
sophisticated laser-range finders that give great accuracy through
darkness, dust or smoke. But some night-vision gear compensated for
the shortcomings.
   The Marines are formulating battle plans assuming they could
face Iraq's most sophisticated, Soviet-designed T-72 tanks.
   ``They can easly destroy us as we can destroy them at 2,400
meters. The best tactic is to flank him and get him from the
side,'' said Sgt. David Harpst of Toledo, Ohio.
   Reflections from the intense desert sun makes targeting
difficult. And the heat makes the guns droop slightly, which can
cause up to six-feet inaccuracy in shots at the maximum range of
2,000 yards.
   Before the first shot was fired, helicopters swept out into the
range for up to 12 miles, looking for camps of nomadic Bedouins and
camel herds.
   A local village leader rides along to explain what is happening.
   A few Bedouins camped near the test range the first day did not
return. ``They know once we start firing to get out of there,''
Kephart said.
   Camels are harder to chase off.
   ``We're told that if we shoot one we have to eat it, so we're
being very careful,'' Kephart said.

   A variety show with women dancers
that expatriates were staging as a morale booster for U.S. troops
was canceled Friday after the Saudi government complained, military
officials said.
   The Saudis said their objection was based on television coverage
of the show, which Lt. Col. John Olsen, a U.S. military spokesman,
said ``caused some discomfort on the part of the Saudi government
and we regret that.''
   The Saudis apparently found a burlesque-like dance routine in
the first act of the show especially offensive. They complained to
U.S. military officials after monitoring the show on CBS, which
aired a brief segment showing four women dancers.
   ``They objected in general, but it was pretty clear that it was
the women that set them off,'' said a military source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Olsen said the military decided it would not send audiences to
the shows because of the Saudi objections.
   The episode is the latest in a series of incidents that have
caused increasing cultural strains between the Americans and their
Saudi hosts.
   Earlier in the week, the Saudi government complained to U.S.
commanders about American soldiers venturing into Saudi towns
carrying their weapons. Saudi officials have also been relaying
complaints about women in the military driving on Saudi roads.
Women are not allowed to drive here.
   The 90-minute show was being staged by a group of Americans,
Britons and other Westerners who wanted to show their appreciation
to the thousands of Americans deployed in Operation Desert Shield.
   At opening night Wednesday, 400 members of the 82nd Airborne
were repeatedly brought to their feet by the performers and many
said afterward that the show was a break from the heat, boredom and
isolation of the desert.
   A second show was staged Wednesday night and two more on
Thursday. But two planned for Friday night were effectively
canceled when military officials, responding to the Saudi
complaint, said they would not allow troops to attend.
   The troupe had planned to put on six shows next week and hoped
to continue the show for several weeks to allow troops to be
rotated in for entertainment while awaiting the arrival of
entertainers being brought in by the USO.
   ``We were just trying to give the guys a break,'' one of the
organizers of the show said, insisting on anonymity because of
fears she would be pealized for participating. ``We were worried
what might happen if the Saudis found out.''
   From the outset, Saudi and American officials have predicted
some cultural clashes as the 100,000-plus American troops settled
in and began to interract with Saudis.
   After weeks of relatively few incidents the last week has become
tense, with several U.S. commanders complaining privately the
Saudis appear unwilling to bend their traditions.
   Saudi offials in turn have complained the Americans were
unnecessarily engaging in activities that offended local customs.
   During a Thursday visit by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, a Saudi official walked up to a senior
American officer here and argued furiously that servicewomen be
sent home or at least prohibited from driving.
   The officer, Gen. Gus Pagonis, who is in charge of the logistics
and supply efforts for the U.S. deployment, could hardly get a word
in as the Saudi official, who refused to identify himself
afterward, insisted that driving by women be halted.
   ``I'm trying to hold back but I must perform my mission,''
Pagonis told the official. ``They must perform the mission.''
   Saudi women appear in public draped in clothing that covers
their faces, arms and legs. Western women also are advised cover
their calves and arms when in public here.

   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee said Friday that the billions of dollars the United
States expects to receive from its allies for the operation against
Iraq must come under congressional regulations.
   ``We've got to make sure that we don't lose the power of the
purse,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., told reporters at a seminar on U.S.
defense policy after the Cold War.
   He was quick to add that the administration isn't trying to
usurp the Congress. However, ``there's some very sticky
questions,'' he said.
   Expressing what has been an increasing concern on Capitol Hill,
Nunn said any of the money from Saudi Arabia or allies contributed
to help defray the cost of the U.S. military buildup should not be
placed in accounts that only the Bush administration could control.
   Saudi Arabia could contribute $1 billion and the administration
could spend it ``any way they want to. They could even take it and
put it on the B-2 bomber,'' he said.
   Congress, Nunn said, should approve a statute to ensure that
whatever money the United States receives must be ``subject to
appropriations and the Congress has to approve that.''
   ``We do not want to get a situation where we have bank accounts
floating around and the executive branch basically able to spend
that money,'' Nunn said.
   Another panelist at the seminar, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, agreed.
   Aspin is working on an amendment to the House version of the
fiscal 1991 defense bill that would prevent the administration from
using the money as it pleases.
   The Senate has approved its version of the defense bill, a $289
billion package for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The House
began work on a $283 billion military spending plan this week, but
has postponed further action because of White House and
congressional negotiations on trimming $50 billion from the federal
deficit.
   He recalled a statement made by one of the nation's founding
fathers, George Mason, who said neither the executive nor the
legislative branches of government should be able to combine ``the
power of the sword and the power of the purse.''
   The seminar was sponsored by the Progressive Policy Institute.

<HEAD>Democrats Back Bush on Gulf, Attack His Domestic Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats formally backed President Bush's
Persian Gulf policy Friday but coupled their endorsement with a
scathing attack on his domestic policies.
   A resolution adopted by the executive committee of the
Democratic National Committee denounced ``a decade of Republican
greed and debt'' and blamed the savings and loan scandal on
``hear-nothing Republican regulatory policy.''
   The resolution was the principal action at the opening session
of the party's two-day meeting.
   Another highlight was the appearance of Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia, making his first speech to a national committee meeting.
   Five years ago, Nunn was a founder of the Democratic Leadership
Council, which was created as a conservative counterweight to the
national party.
   Nunn's denied his appearance before the executive committee was
a signal he is interested in running for president in 1992.
   ``I have no inclinations or plans to run for president,'' Nunn
told reporters who crowded around him as he left the party meeting.
   The senator has stirred presidential speculation with such
actions as his resignation from the all-male Burning Tree golf club
and his recent declaration of support for abortion rights after
decades of being in the opposition camp.
   Nunn said his interest in party politics began with formation of
the DLC, which he described as an effort to ``get the Democratic
Party back in the mainstream.''
   Asked if he thought the people he'd just spoken to were now in
the mainstream, Nunn replied, ``Well, I don't know everybody
here.''
   Nunn said he didn't think the tendency of Americans to rally
around the president in a time of crisis would hurt Democratic
candidates in the fall.
   ``I don't think it's a partisan issue,'' he said. ``I don't
think the public's going to be voting in November based on the
Middle East.''
   Like the Democrats he addressed, Nunn was quick to praise Bush's
handling of the crisis.
   ``I think he's done a very good job,'' said the senator.
   The resolution adopted by the Democrats opened with the
statement that ``Today, our nation stands united in support of
America's mission in the Middle East, united in opposition to
Iraq's aggression. We, the Democratic Party of the United States,
do here formally express our support for our armed forces and the
Persian Gulf policy of our commander-in-chief.''
   The praise stopped at the shore of the Persian Gulf.
   The next paragraph called on the nation to ``abandon Republican
economic policies.''
   The party voiced agreement with Bush's call for spending
reductions but added that ``we insist that those reductions must
not discriminate against those who benefited least from a decade of
Republican greed and debt.''
   It said, ``The S&amp;L crisis is the certain result of do-nothing
Republican public philosophy, hear-nothing Republican regulatory
policy, and see-nothing Republican administration of justice.''
   The full Democratic National Committee was scheduled to adopt
the resolution at its meeting on Saturday.

Sovereignty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev presented to the
national parliament an economic reform plan Friday that proposes
market-oriented policies and other measures to halt the nation's
slide toward bankruptcy.
   But Gorbachev rejected the Russian parliament's conclusion that
the solution to the economic crisis requires stripping the central
government of much of its power. The Gorbachev plan refused to
surrender the Kremlin's power to tax or give republics' laws
superiority over national ones.
   Gorbachev's disagreement with the Russian parliament reduces
hope of a national consensus by the Oct. 1 deadline set by the
president.
   Industrial output has dropped to the point of ``economic
depression, which worsens with every month,'' according to a copy
of his plan obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``The international economic position of the country is
catastrophic. The government's solvency is not guaranteed and
foreign debt is growing rashly,'' it says.
   Without prompt action, ``we would be forced to choose between
hyperinflation and direct seizure of cash from the population and
enterprises,'' the plan says.
   Already, some regions of the Soviet Union are refusing to trade
with each other or resorting to barter.
   The Soviet Union stopped paying its international bills on time
months ago and has sold vast amounts of diamonds and gold in recent
months to raise cash.
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov said Tuesday that imports of
medicine and consumer goods could be cut by two-thirds because of
lack of foreign currency. He said the nation's loan debt service
has risen to $12.5 billion a year and that Western banks were
refusing to lend the Soviet Union more money.
   Gorbachev's report is a combination of a conservative Ryzhkov
plan with the more-radical 500-Day plan approved by the Russian
parliament Tuesday.
   It accepts large parts of the Russian proposal, written by
economist Stanislav Shatalin, including selling government property
to the public, followed by a gradual freeing of state-set prices.
   But Gorbachev's proposal rejects the Russian call for the nation
to become a union of sovereign states similar to the European
Community. Thirteen of the 15 Soviet republics are pursuing
independence or sovereignty, defined as the superiority of the
republic's laws over national ones.
   Economist Abel Aganbegyan told a parliamentary committee session
Friday that the ``sovereignty question'' should be settled under
the new union treaty, which is presently under negotiation.
   But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Grigory Yavlinsky argued it is
already too late to prevent the republics from deciding key
questions such as land and housing.
   Aganbegyan also said it would be ``sheer madness'' to bypass the
500-Day program because it had won the approval of representatives
of all the 15 republics of the Soviet Union. The Russian republic
is the largest.
   Gorbachev's plan agrees with the Russian program in calling for
distribution of housing and land, and for cutting the $105 billion
budget deficit by $10 billion. Gorbachev's plan also would cut
government investment, sharply reduce foreign aid and seek to sell
off other nations' debts to the Soviet Union.
   But it waters down some critical points in the 500-Day plan,
which calls for a 10 percent to 20 percent cut in the defense and
KGB budgets.
   Gorbachev proposes ``significant reductions'' in both bugets but
a recommended figure is blacked out on the copy distributed to
legislators.
   Other items that the Russian plan foresees in its first 100 days
of implementation, but which are dropped in the Gorbachev plan,
include:
   - Ending all industrial subsidies on Jan. 1.
   - Selling off 50 to 60 state-owned firms to individual
stock-holders.
   - Selling off state-owned vehicles, unfinished construction
projects and construction materials.
   Gorbachev's plan agrees to dividing collective farms into
individual plots, and permits local councils to distribute land.
   Gorbachev's package also would cut the artificially high
exchange rate on trade from the current .60 rubles for $1 to 2
rubles for $1 on Nov. 1. The black market rate is 20 to 25 rubles
for $1.
   Holders of foreign currency would be allowed to sell it at
auction to the highest bidder starting in October.

<HEAD>Walesa Predicts He Will Win Presidency ... If He Runs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa says he
will win if he decides to run for president of Poland.
   Walesa said he will make up his mind shortly on whether to be a
candidate in elections expected to be held by spring.
   ``My victory is rather certain,'' he said during his weekly news
conference Thursday in Solidarity's home city of Gdansk.
   ``I am not worried about victory, but about its scale,'' Walesa
said. ``The situation is hard, and if the president is elected with
only 50 percent of the vote, he will have to work 48 hours a day.
... Thus he must win 80 percent.''
   If his former ally and adviser, Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, decides to run against him, Mazowiecki would win 35
percent of the vote, Walesa predicted.
   Mazowiecki has not announced whether he will be a candidate.
   Walesa has split with his handpicked choice for prime minister
over the pace of economic and political reforms. Walesa charges
that Mazowiecki's government is proceeding too slowly to remove
communist holdovers from state industries and agencies, and has
lost touch with society.
   ``The worse thing is society's non-participation and today, 60
percent of society doesn't participate in anything,'' Walesa said.
   He has called for early fully democratic presidential and
parliamentary elections, citing the current arrangement as dated.
   Parliament was elected in June 1989 with the then-Communist
authorities guaranteed seats for the party and its allies. Since
then, a Solidarity-led government has taken power and the Communist
Party has dissolved.
   President Wojciech Jaruzleski, the former Communist Party leader
elected to a six-year term in 1989, has said he is prepared to
resign at the appropriate time.
   Parliament is to discuss the election schedule next week.
   Mazowiecki has agreed with the need for speedy elections. He
said Thursday that ``one should put an end to a state in which
there are no elections but a permanent electoral campaign.''

   Nelson Mandela said Friday
that he and President F.W. de Klerk had concluded a ``hidden hand''
was orchestrating the black township fighting to undermine peace
talks aimed at black-white power sharing.
   Five blacks were killed in Soweto on Friday and 15 others were
thrown from moving trains and injured in Johannesburg, police said.
On Thursday night, youths with guns and machetes killed 26 people
and injured more than 100 on a train traveling from Johannesburg to
Soweto.
   ``We are dealing with highly professional killers,'' Mandela,
the African National Congress leader, said at a Johannesburg news
conference after meeting with de Klerk in Pretoria.
   ``The government is convinced this is no longer a clash between
black and black,'' he said. ``There is a hidden hand here the
government intends to track down.''
   Asked who he thought was responsible, Mandela said, ``We don't
know ... but we have our own suspicions.'' He refused to elaborate.
   Almost 800 blacks have died in the townships ringing
Johannesburg since fighting erupted in early August. The main
combatants have been Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha
movement and Xhosas and other blacks supporting Mandela's ANC.
   Anti-apartheid groups have alleged that police, rogue elements
of the security forces and white extremists have spurred on the
fighting. Witnesses in several townships have claimed that masked
white men participated. But no proof has been offered.
   De Klerk said in a statement that unidentified groups were
attempting to sabotage government efforts to end apartheid and draw
up a new constitution free of racial discrimination.
   ``There are forces which do not wish peaceful negotiations to
succeed,'' he said. ``All those forces desiring peace must stand
together to identify and counter these forces.''
   The president promised ``strong and comprehensive'' action, but
he did not elaborate.
   Mandela said he expected de Klerk to announce steps Monday to
curb the violence. The ANC would not oppose an increased army
presence in the township as long as the troops maintain law and
order, Mandela said.
   But he accused soldiers currently in black areas of behaving
``like an army of occupation'' and using live ammunition
unnecessarily.
   Many black township residents see the army as a more effective
and neutral force than the police.
   The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest black political movements,
both oppose apartheid but differ over tactics and plans for a
future South Africa.
   The ANC waged a 29-year guerrilla campaign against the white-led
government before suspending its armed struggle last month. The ANC
still supports confrontational measures such as boycotts, sanctions
and strikes to pressure the government.
   Inkatha, led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and made up almost entirely
of Zulus, does not endorse such tactics and participates in the
government's black homeland system.
   Inkatha favors a capitalist economy, while the ANC has an
ideological preference for socialism.

<HEAD>Legislator Says Some 1988 S&amp;L Deals Should Be Renegotiated</HEAD>

   The chairman of the House Banking Committee on
Friday described some government sales of failed savings and loans
in late 1988 as ``a giveaway'' and said many of the deals should be
renegotiated.
   The Bush administration's top banking official said the
government is considering ways to renegotiate some of the sale
contracts but does not intend to break them.
   In a report released at Friday's hearing, investigators for the
committee said outside investors in troubled thrifts received $78
in assets and government-granted benefits for every $1 of capital
they put up to buy the institutions.
   ``These so-called deals bear all the earmarks of a giveaway -
with the recipients of the government largesse being some of the
fattest of the nation's financial fat cats,'' Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, said at the hearing. ``We are hopeful that there
can be renegotiations that rectify some of the excesses.''
   Gonzalez said his committee will ``haunt'' the Resolution Trust
Corp., the agency responsible for disposing of failed S&amp;Ls ``until
we have hard evidence that everything is being done to recover as
many of the billions as possible.''
   L. William Seidman, who heads the RTC and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., told the committee that the RTC's efforts ``are to
minimize costs to the government within the provisions of the
contracts.''
   ``We are not considering breaking the government's agreements,''
he said.
   M. Danny Wall, a former government official who directed the
1988 sales, defended the deals as an effort to transfer into
private hands insolvent S&amp;Ls that were draining billions of dollars
from the federal insurance fund.
   ``Our goal was a simple one: Stem the flow of red ink with the
tools and dollars at hand,'' said Wall, chairman of the now-defunct
Federal Home Loan Bank Board. ``It was clear to me and my fellow
board members that time was money, inasmuch as a problem
institution unresolved loses more money every day, as is abundantly
clear today.''
   Wall was accompanied by former members of the bank board and
former officials of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   Lawrence J. White, a former member of the bank board, said the
deals were ``financially sound'' and cost the government $4.7
billion less than the estimated cost of liquidating the failed
thrifts.
   The banking committee report concluded that 94 S&amp;L deals
completed in late 1988 will cost the government around $71 billion
in assistance to buyers of the thrifts, including up to $4.2
billion in tax breaks.
   The investigators' study focused particularly on the sales of
American Savings Bank FA of California and two giant Texas thrifts,
Southwest Savings Association and First Gibraltar Federal Savings
Bank.
   In the American Savings and First Gibraltar deals, the buyers
were given generous tax breaks, the study said.
   A separate report released late Thursday by the General
Accounting Office found that the rescue of American Savings will
cost taxpayers $5.2 billion, three times the government's original
estimate. The institution was purchased by a group led by
billionaire investor Robert M. Bass.
   Southwest Savings was purchased in 1988 by Caroline Hunt, the
daughter of legendary oil man H.L. Hunt, with the help of
government subsidies projected to total $2 billion over 10 years.
Despite the federal aid, the thrift failed a second time and went
back to the government.

   Former President Reagan praised Poland's
democratic struggle Friday but warned post-Communist leaders that
difficult times may come and they must treat each other ``as
opponents, not as enemies.''
   Reagan, making his first visit to Poland, was interrupted by
applause 10 times during a 45-minute speech to Parliament members
and political leaders in Warsaw's Royal Castle.
   ``I have always believed that where freedom is, any friend of
freedom will feel at home. And I have been waiting a long time to
say to the people of Poland, `Today, on your soil, I feel at home,'
'' said Reagan, who imposed strict sanctions on Poland after the
Communists imposed martial law in 1981.
   Many current political leaders in Poland credit the sanctions
with helping to pressure the government into democratic
concessions.
   Poland was the second stop on Reagan's 10-day European trip.
Earlier, he visited Berlin and chipped at the Berlin Wall. He is
scheduled to leave Saturday for the Soviet Union and also plans to
visit Italy.
   ``Even though many Americans have never met a Pole, your
struggle for liberty has moved us deeply,'' said Reagan.
   Reagan also alluded to recent political discord in Poland
between Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki.
   ``It is natural that you will fight hard among yourselves on
issues of great importance,'' he said. ``To protect the liberty you
have won at such a cost, you will need a full measure of the
tolerance and openness that are Poland's tradition. For you
historic transition means that you must fight as opponents, not as
enemies.''
   Reagan planned to meet with Mazowiecki and President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the army general and former Communist Party leader who
imposed martial law but last year agreed to turn over the
government to Solidarity.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, are scheduled to travel to the
Baltic port city of Gdansk on Saturday to see Walesa and visit the
shipyard where Solidarity was born during strikes in August 1980.
   Before leaving Berlin Friday morning, Reagan spoke to about
1,000 U.S. military personnel and their families, praising the
troops for playing an important role in the movements to democracy
in Eastern Europe.
   As a souvenir, U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters gave the former
president one of the old Berlin sector division signs that
announces, in four languages: ``You are leaving the American
sector.''

<TEXT>
   An East German official in charge of
disbanding the secret police was stripped of those duties Friday
after lawmakers criticized him for keeping former agents on his
payroll.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere relieved Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel of reponsibility for a committee
investigating the dreaded security arm of the old Communist regime,
a spokeswoman said.
   The change was the latest development in a chaotic government
that will soon be out of business when West Germany assumes control
of the economically reeling country on Oct. 3, the formal date of
German unification.
   De Maiziere spokeswoman Angela Merkel said Eberhard Stief, state
secretary in the ministry, would take over the role of overseeing
the secret police committee.
   The committee last week gave the government a list of 5,000
people who once worked for the secret police unit known as the
Stasi and had been assigned to various government ministries.
   Officials subsequently fired or suspended nearly 60 people on
the list still holding government posts, most of them in Diestel's
ministry.
   Parliament spent the better part of a 14-hour session on
Thursday debating the recent allegations that the government was
still rife with Stasi agents.
   However, a vote to demand Diestel's resignation failed after de
Maiziere defended the interior minister, who also is the deputy
prime minister.
   De Maiziere relieved Diestel of his duties in an effort to calm
the political crisis, Merkel said. Diestel has become a focal point
for lawmakers seeking a more aggressive purge of the old security
apparatus.
   Merkel also said de Maiziere would authorize an investigation of
his Cabinet ministers after the head of a previous committee
investigating the Stasi said four ministers had worked for the
secret police.
   Meanwhile, the man vying to be leader of a united Germany
visited about 22 activists occupying the former headquarters of the
Stasi.
   The activists, some of whom helped lead the democratic revolt
against Communism last fall, are demanding public access to the
files on 6 million people.
   They also want the files to remain in East German territory
after unification.
   Oskar Lafontaine of the left-leaning Social Democrats is
challenging West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the Dec. 2
elections for a united German government.
   Lafontaine told dissidents holed up in the Stasi archives he
would seek to accommodate their demands. ``I am not here for
campaign reasons,'' he said.
   The Dec. 2 election campaign has shaped much of the debate over
German unification and has helped to dismember the once-broad
coalition government put together by de Maiziere.
   Twelve of the 22 ministers have resigned or been fired the last
few weeks because of incompetence or political feuds over
unification.

<HEAD>Playmates Keep Dark Summer Secret: Missing Friend Fell to Death in
Silo</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five months after the disappearance of a
10-year-old boy, four young playmates revealed a dark summer
secret: They saw their pal fall to his death while playing atop an
abandoned 120-foot-tall grain silo.
   Police said Friday the fatal plunge of Ricky Rodriguez in April
was accidental, but his friends kept quiet in fear they would be
blamed.
   ``They were scared,'' said Detective Eileen Guest, a youth
officer. ``They're just little boys and they thought they were
going to get into trouble.''
   The body was discovered Thursday in an abandoned grain silo at a
deserted Falstaff Brewing Corp. plant on the city's Southeast Side.
Friends said Ricky fell to his death as the five youths bounced on
conveyor belts spanning the silo, police said.
   Investigators interviewed each of the four playmates separately
and concluded the boy's death was accidental, Detective William
Marley said.
   One friend told police he spent a terrifying summer, haunted by
the fall and fears police would not believe it was accidental.
   ``He said he couldn't sleep, that he had been having
nightmares,'' Guest said. The playmates were all about 10 years
old, police said.
   Police scoured the boy's neighborhood after his disappearance,
using helicopters and scuba divers in Lake Michigan. A picture of
Ricky recently was sent to millions of homes as part of a campaign
for missing children.
   ``We searched everywhere we could think of for this boy,'' Sgt.
Robert Jones said. ``It's really sad when a 10-year-old is laying
out there for all that time.''
   Officers searching for the boy considered the deserted brewing
plant virtually inaccessible, he said.
   The mystery unraveled Thursday when a sister of one of Ricky's
playmates overheard a conversation in which the boy said Ricky had
fallen. She told her mother, who notified police.
   The boys entered the silo, which had a locked door, and climbed
15 flights of stairs to get to the top, Guest said.
   ``The area was fenced. But these are little boys - they had no
problem getting over the fence,'' she said. ``It's still unclear
how they got into the building.''
   Guest said the area had been abandoned for more than a decade.
She said she knew of no other reports or complaints of children
entering the area.
   On the afternoon of April 26, Ricky stopped at home and asked
his father what time he should be home for dinner. It was the last
time his family saw the fifth-grader.
   ``Well, everybody can stop looking,'' said the boy's father,
Steve Rodriguez. ``I thought he was dead the night he disappeared.
It just didn't fit his pattern. But ... I was hoping.''

   Iraq trampled on a basic tenet of
international law - the inviolability of foreign diplomats and
embassies - when its troops forced their way into French, Canadian
and Dutch diplomatic quarters in Kuwait, scholars and former
diplomats said Friday.
   Frequently in history, the retaliation for violating diplomatic
immunity has been military action. Sometimes, it has been war.
   ``This is an extremely serious case,'' said Grant McClanahan, a
retired diplomat and author of the 1989 book ``Diplomatic Immunity:
Principles, Practices and Problems.''
   ``It's a very serious insult to the national dignity of the
nations that suffer.''
   The principle of diplomatic immunity - under which diplomats
have freedom of movement and are free from arrest or taxation - is
formally enshrined in the Vienna conventions of 1961 and 1963.
   Those conventions, to which Iraq is a signatory, specifically
say that the residences of diplomats are inviolate and can be
entered by local authorities only with permission from the embassy.
   Iraq transgressed those provisions when its troops entered the
residences of the French and other ambassadors in occupied Kuwait.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had already ignored international
law by arbitrarily demanding the closure of diplomatic missions in
Kuwait and denying permission for some Western diplomats to leave
Iraq.
   The conventions say a nation cannot close an embassy of another
country unless it first breaks relations and may not expel
diplomats unless it declares them ``persona non grata.'' Iraq has
done neither.
   Saddam has tried to muddy the legal waters by annexing Kuwait
and announcing that foreign diplomats there had lost their
diplomatic status.
   But David J. Scheffer, an international lawyer and senior
associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says
Iraq has no legal justification for those declarations.
   Diplomatic law may not have precise rules on occupied countries,
``but international law itself prohibits intervening, occupying and
annexing other countries,'' Scheffer said.
   The concept of diplomatic immunity dates back to biblical times,
and became common practice from the mid-15th century, when foreign
ambassadors first took up residence in the various Italian
city-states.
   The protection of diplomats also has a ``strong basis in Islamic
law,'' said Nathan Brown, director of the Middle East Studies
Program at George Washington University. Mohammed recognized the
importance of good relations with non-Moslem states and the Ottoman
Empire respected the rights of diplomats even when relations with
Europe were at their worst, he said.
   Historically, violations have been taken seriously.
   Hugo Grotius, known as the father of international law, wrote in
his 1625 book ``The Law of War and Peace'' that ``Profane History
is full of wars undertaken on account of the ill-treatment of
ambassadors. Also in the scriptures there is mention of a war which
David waged against the Ammonites on that account.''
   He enumerates many instances where the Romans, and later the
French and Germans, took up arms to redress wrongs done to their
diplomatic corps.
   In more recent times, the United States has frequently used
force to protect its diplomats.
   In 1854 troops destroyed a town in Nicaragua to avenge an insult
to an American envoy. U.S. forces were dispatched to China in 1866
to punish an assault on an American consul and again during the
1900 Boxer Rebellion when the foreign legation in Beijing was under
siege.
   American forces were sent to Chile in 1891 to protect Americans
who had taken refuge at the embassy during a war there and in 1918
the Marines landed in Vladivostok to protect the American consulate
during the Bolshevik-led civil war there.
   The worst recent violation of diplomatic immunity was in 1979,
when Iranian students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days. A botched military rescue attempt
in April 1980 led to the deaths of eight American servicemen on the
Iranian desert.
   The United States took liberties with diplomatic immunity when
U.S. troops forced their way into the residence of the ambassador
of Nicaragua during the U.S. invasion of Panama in December.
President Bush acknowledged the mistake, calling it a ``screw-up.''
   Scheffer said France and other countries whose diplomatic rights
have been infringed upon are fully justified in expelling Iraqi
diplomats in retaliation. But he said that under modern
international law it would be difficult to equate insults to
diplomats with acts of war.
   ``How we respond to a threat to our diplomatic premises in
Kuwait is not going to be as easy to resolve as it was 100 years
ago,'' he said.

   U.S. and Australian sailors fired warning
shots Friday across the bow of an Iraqi tanker sailing toward the
Persian Gulf and then boarded the vessel, American officials said.
   In Washington, a Pentagon source said the sailors fired Friday
from an American frigate in the Gulf of Oman and that an Australian
frigate helped in the operation. A U.S. Navy spokesman in the gulf
said the Australian vessel had also fired a warning.
   President Bush, speaking about the incident at an impromptu
press conference in Washington, said he didn't believe it put the
United States ``closer to a war situation.''
   ``I still hope that this matter can be peacefully resolved. And
the way for that to happen is for Iraq to comply with the
sanctions,'' he said.
   It was the third time during the gulf crisis that U.S. officials
announced American ships had fired warning shots in an effort to
enforce the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq. There have
been no injuries reported in any of the incidents.
   The Iraqi vessel boarded Friday, the Al-Fao, was first
intercepted by the frigate Burton, the Navy spokesman said on
condition of anonymity. Its master said he was headed for the Iraqi
port of Basra with no cargo but refused to allow the Americans to
board.
   ``After repeated requests to allow boarding, the Burton fired
the first warning shots from one of its 50-caliber machine-guns ...
and requested that Al-Fao stop and permit a team to board,'' said
the Navy spokesman.
   ``The Australians fired the second set, also from a 50-caliber
machine-gun about 10 minutes later,'' he said.
   Al-Fao then stopped and sailors from both frigates went on
board, said the spokesman.
   ``The team discovered no prohibited cargo aboard and Al-Fao was
allowed to proceed,'' he added. He said the whole operation, which
began about 4 p.m., took five hours.
   The Al-Fao was one of two Iraqi tankers that last month tried
and failed to break a Saudi Arabian blockade on oil exports through
Iraq's trans-Saudi pipeline terminal on the Red Sea.
   It was earlier reported anchored off Yemen with its sister ship,
Al-Qadissiyah, after port authorities there denied them permission
to enter. The tanker apparently was sailing home when intercepted.
   On Aug. 18, the U.S. Navy fired warning shots across the bows of
two Iraqi vessels that defied orders to stop. But the vessels were
allow to sail out of the Persian Gulf without being boarded.
   The United States is leading the naval buildup designed to
enforce the U.N. sanctions imposed on Aug. 6. They are intended to
force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, which
his forces invaded Aug. 2.
   Hundreds of ships are being chllenged in the Persian Gulf, the
connecting Gulf of Oman, the Red Sea to block Iraq-bound cargo and
Iraqi exports.
   The Navy spokesman said the U.S. Navy alone has intercepted more
than 900 vessels so far. He said the number of vessels reported
boarded has doubled in recent weeks to more than 40, but with
little fanfare. Those actually diverted are fewer than than five.
   British, French, Italian and other warships have also carried
out their own stop-and-search operations.

   The Senate cleared the way Friday for action
on a bill that would require automakers to dramatically increase
fuel economy.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he hoped
to have a vote late next week on the bill that would require
automakers to increase average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles
per gallon by 1995 and to 40 miles per gallon by 2001.
   Supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements would
save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day once they go fully into
effect, but key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure
on the Senate floor.
   Within hours of the vote, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner blasted the legislation as ``unrealistic, irresponsible
and, more important, unattainable.'' He said there's no technology
to achieve the bill's goals without making cars smaller.
   ``It should be called the highway fatality bill,'' Skinner said
at a news conference, citing a new study by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration that concluded a clear link between
reducing the size of cars and traffic deaths.
   The NHTSA study said the introduction of smaller cars over the
past decade had resulted in an estimated 1,340 additional traffic
deaths annually in single-car accidents. Based on those numbers,
NHTSA Administrator Jerry Curry said between 600 and 1,140
additional deaths annually can be expected if automakers try to
meet the 40 mile per gallon standard.
   Skinner said automakers had convinced him that the Senate bill's
fuel economy goals can't be achieved without substantial weight
reductions in cars.
   ``We've just had the first inning of this nine-inning game,''
Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said after the Senate voted 68-28 to
clear the way for debate.
   ``We hope and intend to win this fight,'' Riegle said, adding
that he doubts supporters will get the needed 60 votes to cut off
debate and bring it to a vote next week.
   A similar bill has been introduced in the House, but it has yet
to be taken up by the Energy and Commerce Committee, whose
chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., is staunchly opposed to the
measure.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sponsor of the House bill, said
earlier this week she would try to push the legislation directly on
the House floor in an effort to bypass Dingell's committee.
   But the Senate's 68-28 vote Friday to cut off efforts by Riegle
to keep the measure off the Senate floor was an indication of the
growing support in Congress for a measure to reduce U.S. reliance
on foreign oil, a subject in the spotlight since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``It's the single most important step to reducing our dependency
on OPEC oil and curbing global warming,'' the Sierra Club said of
the bill sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
   In floor debate, Riegle said those fuel savings aren't likely to
begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to today's oil
crisis might be to return to a national speed limit of 55 miles an
hour.
   Later, a Riegle aide said the senator didn't necessarily support
a change in the speed limit.
   Bryan described his bill as a message to Detroit and the
automakers ``that they're going to have to look at fuel economy and
not just muscle cars.''
   ``It does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we don't
start conserving now, some future president may have to consider
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the Middle
East,'' he said.

   Generosity is overwhelming the military agency
responsible for shipping supplies to U.S. troops in the Middle
East, an official said Friday.
   The military received more than 100 offers of food, magazines
and other items since a donation hot line started this week. But
few can be accepted now without interrupting the flow of basic and
priority items such as chemical suits and medicine, said Pat
Miller, spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency.
   The hot line, which is being answered by three people, has been
ringing off the cook, she said. Callers have offered videocassette
recorders, Nintendo games, even fresh lobster. Many want to donate
water.
   ``Some even collected water with the misunderstanding or
thinking that we needed it,'' Ms. Miller said. But Saudi Arabia has
modern desalination plants and local water supplies have been more
than sufficient, she said.
   The calls show ``a tremendous outpouring of patriotism,'' Ms.
Miller said. But they have caused some headaches too.
   Agency officials Friday had to explain to an angry church group
why a truckload of cookies and baked goods couldn't be accepted at
the military post office in New York, Ms. Miller said.
   ``Food items are just a really bad idea,'' she said. ``We have a
way of packaging and shipping the menus that the services are
requesting, according to their own feeding plan.''
   Offers for electronic and recreational items are also being
turned away, at least temporarily.
   ``I wouldn't want to stifle that. If we're still there two
months down the road, some recreational items might be nice,'' Ms.
Miller said.
   After the Armed Forces Radio Network accepted a donation of
25,000 personal stereos, the logistics agency agreed to take 30,000
pre-recorded cassette tapes offered by a record company.
   The agency procures items like food, fuel and medicine that are
used in common by all branches of the military.
   In August, agency statistics show it shipped 318,000 chemical
suits, 200,000 hot weather boots, 100,000 pairs of sunglasses,
nearly 27,000 cans of chigger repellent, 257,000 bottles o
sunscreen and 570,000 dispensers of lip balm for Operation Desert
Shield.
   Ms. Miller suggested the best thing citizens could send to
troops is a letter. The agency has been accepting donations of
stationary so soldiers can write back, she said.
   On Wednesday, the agency took an offer of 1,000 reams of
stationary from Champion International Corp., a paper company based
in Stamford, Conn.

   President Bush on Friday condemned the Iraqi
break-in at France's diplomatic residence in Kuwait as ``a matter
of grave concern to the United States,'' and said he had pledged to
do all he could to support any French response.
   He also said the U.S. Navy had fired warning shots and then
boarded an Iraqi tanker in the Gulf of Oman as part of the effort
to enforce trading sanctions against Iraq.
   Asked by reporters if his words and the U.S. actions were meant
as a ``saber rattling'' threat to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
Bush said no.
   ``When I rattle a saber, the man will know it,'' he promised.
``When an escalation is required from me, Saddam Hussein will know
it.''
   Iraqi troops also entered the Kuwait City compounds of Belgium
and Canada, capturing several French citizens and briefly detaining
the U.S. consul and four other Western consuls who were visiting at
Canada's diplomatic residence at the time.
   The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad lodged a protest. The State
Department withheld the name of the consul.
   As for the naval warning shot and boarding, Bush said of the
Iraqi ship, ``It required a bit of a warning before the captain
pulled ovr and permitted the boarding party to have a look.'' He
added, ``I expect confidently that if it is not carrying any
contraband or anything that will violate the sanctions, that it
will be permitted to go on its way.''
   And the ship, which also was boarded by sailors from an
Australian vessel that fired warning shots, was indeed released
later in the day.
   Bush said he had spoken by telephone to French President
Francois Mitterrand after the Iraqi soldiers broke into the French
compound Friday morning, an action he called ``outrageous.''
   ``I just told him he has the full backing of the United
States,'' Bush told reporters in a brief question-and answer
session outside the White House before leaving for his weekend
retreat at Camp David, Md.
   ``I don't know what France is going to do,'' Bush said after his
conversation with Mitterrand. ``I told him that I view this as a
matter of grave concern to the United States. I told him I would do
anything I could to support what he decides to do.''
   But Bush would not be drawn into discussing whether he was
contemplating military action.
   ``We will continue to do everything possible to ensure that the
sanctions work as intended and to deter and if need be to defend
Saudi Arabia against armed attack,'' he said.
   He said the new incidents ``not only underscore the brutal
behavior of Iraq, but also the international support that exists,
and is marshalled, against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.''
   Bush was asked if the heightened activity on Friday meant a war
with Iraq was closer.
   ``I wouldn't put it closer to a war situation. I still hope that
this matter can be peacefully resolved,'' through Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait and release of foreign hostages, he said.
   ``Any of these incidents, all of them, add up to clear
violations of international law. They do raise tensions, they
clearly do.''
   Bush said he had spoken by telephone to Japan's Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu Thursday night and thanked him for his promise of
increased financial support to pay for the U.S. military effort in
the gulf and to help poor countries suffering due to the
U.N.-sponsored trade embargo against Iraq.
   He said he also talked to Britain's Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher who informed him she would dispatch ``a full armored
brigade, along with additional helicopters and aircraft'' to join
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
   Also Friday, Bush asked Congress for an extra $1.9 billion to
pay for the military buildup in the Persian Gulf, and the White
House disclosed he had warned Iraq not to back any terrorist
attacks against U.S. interests.
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the U.S. charge
d'affaires in Baghdad had warned the Iraqi Foreign Ministry on
Thursday that ``we have cause for grave concern about any links
between Iraq and various terrorist organizations, that we hold them
responsible for any terrorist acts that might occur.''
   He said the warning was not based on any specific threats it
considers credible, but that U.S. intelligence had found ``possible
links between Iraq and terrorist kinds of planning activities.''
   ``We have been concerned about this and we have made that known
to Saddam Hussein,'' Fitzwater said.
   Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the
administration's primary concern was that Iraq might use its own
intelligence apparatus to undertake terrorist operations.
   ``The second source of concern are the many terrorist groups and
radical elements that are either based in Baghdad or that receive
support from Saddam Hussein's government,'' he said.
   Bush sent a request to Congress to increase 1990 spending to
cover costs of the Persian Gulf militry action, and to provide
legal mechanisms that will allow the United States to accept
donations from other countries that have volunteered to help bear
the costs.
   In addition, Bush sought congressional approval to forgive $7
billion in military debt that Egypt owes the United States. Bush
said he wanted to forgive the debt in thanks for Egypt's
cooperation in the U.S. strategy against Iraq.
   Meanwhile, an additional 300 American women and children and
non-American family members left Kuwait Friday morning en route to
London. They were due to arrive in Baltimore on Saturday.
   An additional flight was scheduled to leave Kuwait Saturday
morning with the same destination, scheduled for arrival on Sunday.

   A French court has charged a member of a mercenary
squad with assassinating the president of the Comoro Islands when
his group seized power there last year.
   The French news agency Agence-France Presse, quoting an
unidentified court source, said Jean-Paul Guerrier was ordered
jailed by Judge Chantal Pedrix pending further proceedings.
   Ms. Pedrix has presided since April over an inquiry requested by
the family of slain President Ahmed Abdallah. He was shot to death
Nov. 26 at the presidential palace in Moroni, capital of the Indian
Ocean island nation.
   Guerrier was a member of a unit of mercenaries who worked for
Abdallah under the command of former French army officer Bob
Denard. Denard's men briefly seized power on the islands after the
assassination, but French troops forced them to leave.
   Denard, who took refuge in South Africa, denied responsibility
for the president's killing. He is wanted in France for alleged
offenses during an attempted coup in the African nation of Benin in
1977.
   The Comoros became independent of France in 1975.

   Free mailing privileges have been approved for
U.S. service members deployed in the Mideast, the Pentagon said
Friday.
   The step is being taken in cooperation with the U.S. Postal
Service despite the lack of action on pending congressional
legislation permitting such a move, a statement said.
   The decision clears up a problem that arose earlier this week
when the postal service said it was ready to go ahead with the
privilege, but the Pentagon said it lacked congressional
authorization.
   The free mail authorization will be funded by the postal service
as an interim measure until legislation allows the appropriated
funds for postage, the Pentagon said.
   For troops in the field, the military collects mail and
transfers it to the postal service for dispersal.
   Service men and women will be allowed to send personal letters,
postcards and recorded cassettes.
   They may from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman,
Bahrain and the adjacent waters to any place within the United
States, any U.S. territories or possessions or to any military post
office, the statement said.

   Tom Fogerty, rhythm guitarist for the
popular 1960s band Creedence Clearwater Revival, has died, a
spokeswoman announced Friday. He was 48.
   Fogerty, older brother of Creedence lead singer John Fogerty,
died here Sept. 6 of respiratory failure due to tuberculosis, said
Terri Hinte, a spokeswoman for Fantasy Records.
   San Francisco Bay area-based Creedence, a rock 'n' roll band
with eight top 10 singles and six gold albums, broke up in 1972.
Their hits included ``Proud Mary,'' ``Born on the Bayou,'' and
``Bad Moon Rising.''
   The Fogerty brothers and friends Doug Clifford and Stu Cook
recorded under various names for nearly 10 years before scoring
their first hit as Creedence, ``Suzie Q,'' in 1968.
   Tom Fogerty had released several solo albums in addition to his
work with CCR. In the early '70s, he worked occasionally with
organist Merl Saunders and Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia.
   In addition to John Fogerty, survivors include wife Tricia, six
children and three other brothers.
   Services were held in Scottsdale.

   Teen-age thieves stole computer tapes containing
vital information on the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster and
erased data before officials could catch them, the Tass news agency
said Friday.
   Health data on 500,000 residents of the region surrounding
Chernyobyl and information on radioactive contamination of 20,000
towns and villages was blanked out of the tapes stolen from the
Research Institu press not
to wipe off the data,'' Tass said. ``Their request was not
heeded.''
   The news agency did not say when the theft took place, how it
was done, or why the unspecified number of youths involved erased
the data. As for motive, police official Litsian Sobolevsky was
quoted only as saying the teen-agers were after money.
   Technical experts were trying to salvage data from the disks,
Tass said.
   In a related development, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov told a Moscow news conference there was no danger of
another explosion at the Chernobyl plant, where a reactor caught
fire and exploded on April 26, 1986.
   Reports in the West German news media last month quoted Soviet
experts who said they feared the floor of the damaged reactor could
give way under the weight of concrete slabs and release huge
amounts of radioactivity.
   Gerasimov said a concrete block, reinforced with metal rods, had
been erected after the accident to prevent the escape of radiation
and to protect the environment.
   ``As a result of these measures, the integrity of the structure
has been insured for 30 years,'' Gerasimov said. ``Nothing terrible
can happen there, there can be no second explosion.''
   Scientists are still studying how to carry out the final
disposal of the damaged reactor, Gerasimov said.
   The accident at Chernobyl, in the Ukraine, left 31 dead,
according to official count. Unofficial reports say 250 died.
   The blast spewed cesium, strontium and plutonium over a wide
area of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia, and sent a cloud of
radioactive gas around the world.

<TEXT>
   The parents of a comatose Missouri woman who
was the subject of the Supreme Court's first decision on a person's
right to die said Friday they hope a new legal effort will allow
their daughter to die.
   ``The bottom line is we haven't stopped fighting yet because we
believe in what we're doing,'' said Joe Cruzan, a sheet metal
worker from Carterville, Mo.
   Nancy Cruzan, 33, has been in a coma-like state since she was
injured in a 1983 car accident. The Supreme Court in June blocked
the Cruzans' request to end their daughter's life.
   Cruzan and his wife, Joyce, spoke here at a law and medical
symposium on the right to die.
   The couple asked a Missouri state court last month for
permission to remove the tube that provides food and water to their
brain-damaged daughter. They said three people had come forward
recently with information about her wishes concerning
life-sustaining medical treatment.
   No hearing has been held on the latest request.
   The Supreme Court said the Cruzans lacked ``clear and
convincing'' proof that their daughter would want to die. In the
5-4 decision, the justices said states have broad power to keep
patients on life-support systems when they have not made their
wishes known conclusively.
   ``I feel like that the new witnesses coupled with the existing
testimony, if that's not clear and convincing then I don't know how
you're going to achieve that unless Nancy can raise up from her bed
and write out something and then lay back,'' Cruzan said.
   He said another option was to move their daughter to another
state.
   Nancy Cruzan can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are
open and move randomly. Her body is rigid, with her hands and feet
bent into claw shapes.
   ``Looking back, if I had to do it over again I'd probably do
exactly the same thing I did then,'' her father said. ``If I knew
then what I know now, I would have probably tried to take her home
and do it quietly because I know that it's done.''

   Feminist leaders said Friday the clock would
be turned back 25 years on women's rights if David Souter is
confirmed as a Supreme Court justice.
   ``If we lose this one, we'll never get it back,'' said Eleanor
Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, who is lobbying the
Senate to reject the nominee.
   Smeal said she had read all 200 of Souter's legal opinions and
believes he would work to cut off women's access to birth control
and abortion.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said Souter revealed his opposition to abortion by calling it the
``killing of unborn children.''
   ``That's the language of the right wing,'' Yard said.
   Souter did not use the words during the Senate Judiciary
Committee hearings this week, but while New Hampshire attorney
general he signed a brief that contained the language.
   However, during the hearings Friday, Souter said he has not made
up his mind on the abortion rights issue and would consider both
sides if he is confirmed.
   ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs.
Wade,'' Souter in reference to the case that legalized abortion.
``I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up my
mind and I would not go on the court saying I must go one way or I
must go the other way.''
   But Yard said that Souter's repeated reference to the abortion
rights position as ``the other side,'' was evidence of where he
stood.
   Smeal and Yard, who have attended most of the hearings, said
Souter's answers to questions on constitutionally protected privacy
rights concerning birth control indicated he believed in the
concept for married couples, but left open whether single people
had the same right.
   Smeal said the addition of Souter to the court would create the
majority needed to whittle away at a woman's right to abortion and
birth control until access no longer existed.
   ``It would take about 10 years,'' she said. ``First would be a
requirement that teen-agers get parental consent for an abortion,
then spousal consent.''
   She predicted the court then would restrict the time period in
which an abortion could be performed and then limit the kind of
facility that could do the operation.
   Those decisions would be followed by requirements that
teen-agers get parental consent for birth control requiring a
physician's prescription and later that women get their husbands'
consent, Smeal said.
   ``The last step would be outlawing the sale of birth control to
single people,'' she said. ``That would take us back to 1965.''
   That year, in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a case involving the
sale of contraceptives, the court for the first time recognized a
constitutional right of privacy. The decision led to widespread
availability of birth control for married and unmarried people.
   Smeal said women's ability to get out from under the burden of
unwanted pregnancies have been the key to the many advances they
have been able to achieve outside the home.
   Smeal and Yard spoke to a rally organized by NOW across the
street from the Capitol. About 150 people opposing the Souter
nomination attended.

<TEXT>
   A $459 million bus tunnel opens Saturday after
four years of ripped-up streets and traffic nightmares, offering to
zip commuters through congested downtown in about one-third the
time it takes on the surface.
   The two-lane tunnel is expected to reduce downtown bus traffic
25 percent by next fall and 40 percent by the end of the decade.
   Officials with Metro, the King County transit and
sewage-treatment agency overseeing the project, hope the tunnel
entices new riders. It will be months before Metro knows whether
downtown traffic has been eased and ridership is up.
   Metro ordered 236 Italian-made buses at $525,000 each.
Deliveries are behind schedule, however, and there are only 51 new
buses, said Metro spokesman Dan Williams.
   The five-station tunnel opens to the public Saturday.
   The mostly north-south route stops at Westlake Mall, stations in
the financial district and historic Pioneer Square, and surfaces at
the International District near the Kingdome sports center.
   Commuter frustration is high in the Seattle area, which
experienced explosive suburban growth in the past decade. The city
has no light-rail system, though the tunnel is equipped with
recessed rails.
   About 225,000 people use Metro's buses daily, and 84 percent of
them travel to downtown Seattle, Williams said.
   The tunnel lies in the downtown free-bus zone, instituted years
ago to ease traffic. Commuters from outside the city center must
pay fares that begin at 75 cents.

<HEAD>100-Nation Meeting Urges Tighter Nuclear Export Controls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates from about 100 countries pledged to seek
tighter conditions for exports of nuclear materials to countries
that have not signed a treaty banning the spread of atomic weapons,
diplomats said Friday.
   Oswaldo de Rivero, chairman of a conference reviewing compliance
with the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty, said such a wide
international call for tougher controls was unprecedented.
   In a separate measure prompted partly by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, delegates urged the International Atomic Energy Agency to
strenthen its surveillance of nuclear installations to prevent
clandestine production of atomic weapons.
   Iraq signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty but has tried to import
components that could be used in the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
   The two recommendations were part of a final conference
declaration that was expected to be adopted over the weekend.
   Delegates agreed to ask the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency to consider starting short-notice inspections. It
currently inspects according to a fixed schedule.
   Participants also agreed to recommend to exporters of nuclear
materials that they require, ``as a precondition of doing
business,'' that customers have all atomic installations under the
agency's surveillance, de Rivero told reporters.
   The move is aimed at countries that have not signed the
non-proliferation treaty and are believed to have nuclear weapons
capability. They include Israel, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina,
India and Pakistan.
   The United States, Canada, Australia and Sweden have already
banned nuclear exports to countries refusing full inspection. West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told the conference
his country plans to adopt the same restriction.
   In a mainly symbolic move, the United States, the Soviet Union
and Britain pledged for the first time to defend non-nuclear states
from attack, de Rivero said. They are the three nations with
nuclear capability that also have signed the non-proliferation
treaty.
   The move appeared aimed at addressing longtime concerns among
non-nuclear states that the treaty is fundamentally unbalanced.
   The treaty requires states that do not possess nuclear weapons
to refrain from building or acquiring them. In return, the United
States, Soviet Union and Britain pledge to work toward eliminating
their arsenals and provide peaceful nuclear technology to other
nations.
   Members meet every five years to review the treaty's success.
About two-thirds of the 141 member countries are attending the
current session.
   Debate over disarmament goals was subdued this year because of
superpower efforts to cut nuclear arms since 1985 and the lessening
of Cold War tensions, de Rivero said.
   ``This produced a lot of compromises and tolerance among the
parties,'' he said.
   Two nuclear weapon states, France and China, are not formally
affected by the conference since both have not signed the treaty.
   However, both sent conference observers for the first time in
what Western diplomats said was a sign that they might sign on.
   In an annex to the final declaration, France and China will join
the three other nuclear states in reaffirming previous guarantees
that they will never attack a non-nuclear state, de Rivero said.

<HEAD>FDA Warns Against Dishes Containing Raw Eggs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warning! The federal government says homemade
eggnog can be hazardous to your health.
   So can homemade mayonnaise, caesar salad and other dishes
containing raw eggs.
   The Food and Drug Administration recommended Friday that raw
eggs be classified as a ``potentially hazardous food'' and said
that improperly cooked eggs raise the danger of salmonella food
poisoning.
   Specifically, the agency urged people to stop using raw eggs for
such dishes as caesar salad, homemade mayonnaise, eggnog and ice
cream.
   The warning was contained in 3,500 notices sent to state and
local food regulatory agencies.
   Labeling a food as ``potentially hazardous'' doesn't mean ``that
a food is inherently unhealthful,'' FDA spokesman Chris Lecos said.
   He said other perishable but ``perfectly wholesome, nutritious''
foods such as meats, dairy products and cooked vegetables are also
considered ``potentially hazardous.''
   But he said the FDA, in conjunction with the Agriculture
Department, is trying to halt the spread of the salmonella
enteriditis bacteria, which has entered the genetic systems of some
layer hens and contaminated their eggs.
   Agriculture Department figures show there were 6,604 illnesses
and 43 deaths attributed to salmonella from January 1985 to last
October. Eggs were implicated in 73 percent of 189 recorded
outbreaks.
   The FDA notice advises that eggs be refrigerated at temperatures
of 45 degrees fahrenheit or less and thoroughly cooked at 140
degrees fahrenheit.
   It says whole eggs should be cooked until the white is
completely coagulated and firm and the yolk begins to thicken.
Scrambled eggs need to be cooked until firm throughout.
   Restaurants and food service operations are told not to use raw
eggs in uncooked, ready-to-eat menu items and cooks are urged to
substitute pasteurized eggs and egg products for shell eggs in
recipes for salads, sauces, mayonnaise and ice cream calling for
raw eggs.
   Louis B. Raffel, president of the American Egg Board, said egg
producers agree on the need for precautions. ``The industry's
feeling is that eggs should be refrigerated and that proper
handling at all levels is important to avoid any food-related
diseases.''
   Cathy McCharen, vice president of the Egg Nutrition Center in
Washington, said the industry has been giving similar advice for
the last two years. The recommendations ``will force food handlers
and restaurateurs to treat the egg with the kind of respect it
deserves. That we do want to see.''
   USDA spokeswoman Margaret Webb said 56 salmonella outbreaks have
been confirmed since February, with 22 definitely linked to eggs.
She said eggs may also be implicated in other cases, which have
centered in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states.
   Pennsylvania has reported nine outbreaks of the illness, which
can cause vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps and can be fatal to
the elderly and young children.

<HEAD>Liberian Rebel Leader Meets U.S. Ambassador</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Prince Johnson met with
U.S. Ambassador Peter de Vos on Friday and discussed how to end
Liberia's tribal war following President Samuel Doe's death, the
U.S. Embassy said.
   Bursts of gunfire interrupted periods of calm in the war-ravaged
capital as the rival rebel armies of Johnson and Charles Taylor
raced to reach the fortified presidential mansion, Liberia's seat
of government.
   Johnson appeared to have pushed Taylor's forces back after they
had advanced from the city's eastern suburbs to within a few
hundred yards of the mansion. Johnson controls the city center and
areas west of the capital - including the diplomatic enclave on
Mamba Point - below the clifftop executive mansion.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Johnson and de Vos talked for 45
minutes at Johnson's request and discussed ``how to bring peace to
Liberia and to provide humanitarian relief to the Liberian
people.'' It was Johnson's first visit to the embassy, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   ``The U.S. government has been and continues to be in contact
with all the parties in the Liberian conflict and, in this context,
Field Marshal Prince Johnson came to the embassy to exchange
views,'' the spokesman said. He refused to elaborate.
   Washington has valuable installations, including a ship-tracking
station and CIA message transmission center, in this West African
nation, which was founded in 1847 by freed American slaves.
   American administrations gave Doe's government $500 million in
aid from 1980-85 despite charges of gross human rights abuses by
his administration. The aid was reduced the last two years.
   Johnson's men massacred Doe's bodyguards and wounded Doe on
Sunday. The president was reported dead the next day and his
mutilated body was put on display.
   Since then, rebels led by Taylor and Johnson have been locked in
battle.
   Rebels from both camps also have mercilessly sought revenge.
They have hunted down and killed members of Doe's Krahn tribe just
as the government troops had slaughtered civilians of the Gio and
Mano tribes, which supported the rebels.
   The U.S. government supports the Economic Community of West
African States' decision to send a 3,000-member task force to
Monrovia, the U.S. Embassy spokesman said Friday.
   The military force was intended to end the civil war, which has
killed an estimated 5,000 civilians and caused starvation.
   But Taylor has fought the West African force, claiming it merely
wanted to prop up Doe after establishing a cease-fire.
   The West African soldiers, who have orders to withhold fire
except in self-defense, stood by without firing a shot when Johnson
attacked Doe at the force's headquarters Sunday.
   On Thursday, Johnson agreed to allow the West African forces to
evacuate people from the executive mansion, and 1,000 mainly women
and children trapped there were escorted to the port headquarters.
   The fate of soldiers who remained in the mansion, saying they
distrusted promises of safe conduct, was not known Friday.

<HEAD>Magellan's Radar Turned on; Venus Mapping to Resume Saturday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers turned on Magellan's radar
Friday for the first time in a month, preparing the sometimes
unruly spacecraft to start mapping the rugged landscape of
cloud-covered Venus.
   ``I personally am excited and jumping around,'' said Ed Sherry,
technical assistant to the Magellan project manager at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   The last and only other time engineers used Magellan's radar was
during a picture-making test on Aug. 16, only hours before they
lost touch with the spacecraft for 14 hours. Radio contact was lost
again for 17{ hours starting Aug. 21.
   ``I am delighted to see the blue sky that we knew was at the end
of this tunnel,'' Sherry said Friday after engineers received
confirmation at 8:14 a.m. PDT that they successfully turned on the
radar.
   Magellan's radar was to remain on standby until Saturday, when
it will be ordered to send radar waves through Venus' thick clouds
and bounce them off the rugged surface. Magellan then will collect
the reflected radar echoes and send the data to Earth, where it
will be made into pictures and maps.
   If all goes well, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration hopes to release new pictures of Venus early next
week, Sherry said.
   He cautioned that NASA may lose contact with Magellan again
because engineers have yet to determine the cause of the earlier
blackouts.
   But they have equipped Magellan with new computer commands that
should allow them to restore contact within four to 24 hours if it
is lost again, then resume mapping within two weeks.
   NASA's official stance is that Magellan's $744 million mapping
mission won't start until late this month. But if everything works
well this weekend, officials may declare retroactively that mapping
began Saturday, Sherry said.
   ``We're not being foolhardy and rushing into a restart of
operations,'' said David Okerson, a Magellan engineer.
   Magellan's first pictures of Venus - made during the Aug. 16
radar test - showed surprisingly violent forces shape the planet.
   The pictures revealed vast flows of solidified lava, volcanic
cinder cones, huge meteorite impact craters, extensive
``Venusquake'' faults, numerous valleys and mountain ridges and
large calderas. The calderas are volcanic craters created when the
summit of a volcano collapses as lava flows out from vents on the
volcano's flanks.
   Sherry said that during the weekend, Magellan will fly over
Ishtar Terra - a continent-like highland area about the size of
Australia - and a plain on Ishtar that is named Lakshmi Planum.
   Optical cameras can't penetrate Venus' thick clouds. Magellan's
radar penetrates the clouds to make pictures 10 times more detailed
than those produced by Earth-based radar or radar on the Soviet
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which visited Venus in the mid-1980s.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a looping
948 million-mile voyage from Earth. It was launched from the space
shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989.
   Magellan's primary mission will last 243 days - the time it
takes for Venus to rotate once as Magellan circles the planet in a
nearly polar orbit.
   The spacecraft should be able to map 70 percent to 90 percent of
the surface during the initial mapping mission. But NASA officials
have said they expect to extend Magellan's mission so the entire
planet can be mapped.
   Magellan made its Aug. 16 pictures during two orbits around
Venus. But only 1{ orbits worth of picture data were returned
before contact was lost. Sherry said half the remaining picture
information was radioed to Earth on Wednesday night. Engineers
hoped to retrieve the remainder early Saturday.
   Despite 900-degree Fahrenheit surface temperatures created by a
runaway ``greenhouse effect,'' Venus is the planet most like Earth
in terms of size, mass, density and distance from the sun.
   Scientists hope to learn the extent to which Venus is shaped by
forces similar to those that sculpted Earth's terrain.
   They are particularly interested in knowing if Venus has plate
tectonics, which is the movement of giant plates of crustal rock
that makes continents drift slowly across the face of the Earth.
   Many scientists doubt Venus has drifting plates, and believe its
crustal movements are caused by ``hot spots'' in which molten
material bubbles upward - the process that created the Hawaiian
Islands on Earth.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Continued High Public Interest in Gulf Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two-thirds of Americans surveyed in a
poll released Friday said they are closely following events in the
Persian Gulf, and a similar proportion think news media coverage of
the crisis has been fair.
   The poll commissioned by the Times Mirror Center for The People
&amp; The Press also said some Americans seem to be tiring of the
extent of coverage of the gulf crisis.
   The Times Mirror Center is a Washington-based public opinion
research group owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los
Angeles Times and other newspapers.
   Sixty-three percent of those surveyed from Sept. 10 to 12 said
they were ``very closely'' following news about the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait and the deployment of U.S. forces to the gulf
area. In an August survey, the figure was 66 percent.
   The public also is keenly interested in several related stories,
the poll said.
   Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they were closely
following news about rising gasoline prices, and 57 percent said
they were tracking developments about Americans and other
Westerners being held hostage in Kuwait and Iraq.
   The only major aspect of the gulf story to gain little public
interest was the Helsinki summit Sept. 9 between President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The poll said 26 percent of
respondents closely followed news of the summit.
   Last June, following a Bush-Gorbachev summit in Washington, a
Times Mirror Center poll said 38 percent kept a close eye on news
about the meeting.
   Despite continued high public interest in news about the gulf
crisis, the survey indicated that some have tired of the extent of
coverage. Fifteen percent of respondents volunteered that there was
too much news on the subject.
   Americans gave the news media generally high marks for coverage
of the crisis. About two-thirds said the media have treated the
story fairly. Ten percent said the media have been too critical of
American positions, while 11 percent called coverage too
supportive.
   A plurality of those surveyed said the views of Americans who
oppose the buildup of U.S. military forces in the gulf region have
not been adequately aired. Forty percent expressed that opinion,
while 15 percent said critics have gotten too much coverage and 35
percent said there was too little coverage of this.
   When asked whether they favored using military force against
Iraq in the event that U.N. economic sanctions fail to dislodge
Iraq from Kuwait, 63 percent said ``yes,'' 24 percent said ``no,''
and 13 percent said they didn't know.
   The poll said 68 percent of respondents approved of Bush's
overall performance as president, a decline from a 75 percent
approval rating in an August Times Mirror Center poll.
   The survey was conducted for the Times Mirror Center by The
Gallup Organization in Lincoln, Neb., under the direction of
Princeton Survey Research Associates. The results are based on
telephone interviews with 1,244 adults.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEAD>U.S. Wants to Keep Military Presence in Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government wants to keep U.S. soldiers
based in the Philippines as long as they're welcome, a State
Department spokesman said Friday after a congressman said U.S.
negotiators likely will propose a 10-year phase out of American
Philippine bases.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher declined to discuss U.S. negotiating
positions in talks expected to open next week in Manila on the
future of two of the United States' largest foreign bases.
   ``We will continue to support a U.S. military presence in the
Philippines if we are welcome to do so by the Philippines,'' he
said. ``We feel it would be premature to speculate on the outcome
of the negotiations before the two sides meet.''
   The talks cover an agreement that allows unlimited U.S. access
to Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Base and four smaller facilities
until Sept. 16, 1991.
   On Thursday, Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said he had
talked with U.S. negotiators who he said are considering a 10-year
phase out.
   ``I have the impression that this is a timetable they are
comfortable with and likely to propose,'' the New York Democrat
said in a telephone interview.
   Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, minority leader on the Solarz
subcommittee, said he had no direct knowledge of the U.S.
negotiating position but agreed that a phase out is probable
because of the decreased Soviet threat in Asia and Philippine
sovereignty concerns.
   ``A gradual phase out is a likely conclusion at this point,''
Leach said.
   The Washington Post, citing congressional and administration
sources, reported Friday that the United States will seek a phase
out of the bases in the Manila talks.
   If U.S. negotiators seek a definite end to the bases agreement,
it would be a departure from longstanding U.S. assertion that the
bases are vital to U.S. and regional defense interests. The
administration has said that if the bases are not wanted they will
go, but has never publicly suggested it would propose a withdrawal.
   U.S. officials have long said the bases are critical to defense
strategies in the Pacific and elsewhere and have never publicly
suggested they would negotiate even a long-term withdrawal.
   A phase out would open the way for a commercial agreement under
which the U.S. military might rent portions of the facilities if
both sides feel a U.S. presence is needed into the next century,
said Solarz.
   Richard Armitage, former assistant defense secretary who heads
the U.S. negotiating team, was en route to Manila for the talks,
but U.S. officials would not say exactly when he would arrive or
when the negotiations will begin. Philippine officials have said
they will start Monday.
   Recent bombings in Manila and threats against Americans have
prompted the U.S. reluctance to give details about arrangements for
the talks.
   Previous negotiations have focused primarily on the amount of
aid the U.S. government gives in connection with the bases.
Filipino negotiators have reportedly asked for $1 billion a year
and more.
   The Reagan administration pledged $962 million over two years to
keep the bases until September 1991, but Congress cut $96 million
from the request.

   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter said
Friday he had not made up his mind about how he would vote as a
justice if the court were asked to overturn its 1973 decision
legalizing abortion.
   While refusing repeatedly to give his own views on abortion,
Souter told the Senate Judiciary Committee during the second day of
his confirmation hearings:
   ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs.
Wade (the 1973 ruling). I would listen to both sides of that case.
I have not made up my mind and I would not go on the court saying I
must go one way or I must go the other way.''
   Abortion foes have high hopes that President Bush's nominee to
replace liberal Justice William J. Brennan will provide the
critical vote to overturn the decision.
   Abortion-rights groups have expressed fears that that might
indeed happen, and Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion
Rights Action League announced their opposition Friday to Souter's
nomination.
   The day's most dramatic moment came when Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., pressed Souter to explain his role, as New Hampshire's
attorney general, in defending the state's literacy requirement for
voters.
   After Kennedy recited a quote attributed to Souter that the
votes of illiterates ``dilute the votes of those people who can
read,'' Souter responded, ``That is kind of a statement of math.''
   Suggesting that Souter's response was callous, Kennedy said,
``That's something that I find is troublesome.''
   Earlier, Kennedy had asked Souter whether he believed abortion
is moral. Souter refused to answer, but said his view on abortion's
morality ``will play absolutely no role'' in his deciding any
abortion case that would come before him.
   Souter again refused to give his personal view after Kennedy
noted that ``Sandra Day O'Connor responded to that question,
judge'' during the confirmation hearings that preceded her joining
the Supreme Court in 1981.
   Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., also expressed
frustration over his inability to draw Souter out on abortion.
   ``No one here is seeking a commitment on anything,'' Biden said.
   Also on abortion, Souter told the committee he had voted to let
such operations be performed at a hospital where he served on the
board of trustees. But he said his vote did not necessarily reflect
his moral views on abortion.
   On another topic, Souter told the senators that as a judge he
might go against some of the stands he took as New Hampshire's
attorney general in freedom-of-religion cases.
   But he defended his prosecution of demonstrators who opposed the
building of the Seabrook nuclear reactor in New Hampshire.
   Meanwhile, President Bush touted his nominee at a news
conference and at a White House meeting with an international
gathering of judges.
   Bush said he had watched portions of the hearings on television,
and he called his nominee's effort ``magnificent ... masterful.''
   Souter will return for more questioning on Monday.
   He was asked by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., about his vote to
allow abortions while on the Concord Hospital's board in the
mid-1970s. The nominee noted that legalized abortion was ``the law
of the land'' after the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe vs.
Wade.
   While indicating that some trustees might have had moral
scruples against abortion, he said, ``We did not believe it was
appropriate to impose those views on the hospital.''
   Souter attempted to distance himself from his involvement, as
state attorney general, in two freedom-of-religion controversies of
the 1970s.
   In one, he defended Gov. Meldrim Thomson's order that flags on
all state government buildings be flown at half staff on Good
Friday to commemorate Jesus Christ's death.
   In the other, he prosecuted two Jehovah's Witnesses for covering
the state motto, ``Live Free or Die,'' on theirautomobile license
plates.
   Noting that the flag-lowering order was struck down by a federal
judge in Boston, Souter said, ``If I were sitting as a judge today,
I probably would have ruled the same way'' as did the judge in that
case.
   And he conceded that New Hampshire's interest in the license tag
case was ``not particularly compelling.''
   An interesting exchange occurred when Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, complained about activist judges and asked Souter about
``rights created by the courts.''
   ``The Supreme Court should only act, and can only act, when it
has the judicial responsibility under ... the Constitution, but the
Supreme Court is left to act alone when the political branches do
not act beforehand,'' Souter said.
   Citing the 1954 high court decision that outlawed racial
segregation in America's public schools, he said, ``We had Brown
vs. Board of Education ... because we had no decision from any
other branch of the government, at any other level of the
government, facing the undoubted constitutional problem that had to
be solved.''
   Souter said Congress' willingness to aggressively protect the
Constitution's promise of equal protection of the law for all is
welcome ``so the court is not left in the position of seeming to be
the only guarantor of some of the very liberties that we must most
be concerned with.''
   He added: ``Judges are not the only people in our governmental
structure who are sworn to uphold the Constitution and to try to
make it work. The executive, the president of the United States,
takes such an oath. All of you take such an oath ... you are just
as much responsible for making good on the Constitution's
guarantees as we are in the judiciary.''
   On another topic, Souter said he may have been quoted out of
context when in a speech he reportedly used the phrase
``affirmative discrimination'' to describe affirmative action.
   ``It goes without saying that when we consider the powers of the
judiciary to remedy discrimination that has gone before,'' Souter
told Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., ``the appropriate response is not to
say `Stop doing it.' The appropriate response is to say `Undo
it.'''
   Souter, who spent seven years on the New Hampshire Supreme Court
before being named a federal appeals court judge by Bush last
April, would become the Supreme Court's 105th justice if confirmed.
   The Judiciary Committee will vote on Souter's nomination after
completing its hearings sometime next week. The nomination then
will go to the full Senate.

   Violent weather, heavy rains, and hail pelted parts of Michigan
and Indiana and a three-week heat wave in Nebraska broke Friday.
   Tornadoes touched down in southern Michigan but there were no
reports of injuries. A employee of a dry cleaners in the Detroit
suburb of Beverly Hills said she was sure it was a tornado that
almost carried her off as it blasted through the building.
   ``The wind did pick me up. My feet actually came off the ground.
It was pretty scary,'' said Brenda Reeves. ``God was looking out
for me, because if the dry cleaner hadn't come back and grabbed me,
I would have gone out of the door.''
   There were reports of damage from thunderstorm wind gusts near
Chase, Beal City, Paw Paw, Flint, and north of Mishawaka, Ind.
Gusts reached 60 mph west of Flint and 65 mph at Crawfordsville,
Ind.
   Hail hit Tuscola, Mich., and heavy rain from strong storms
caused flooding of streets, small streams and low lying areas
around Three Rivers, Mich.
   The sizzling heat wave that had gripped Nebraska since Aug. 23
broke Friday with temperatures dropping back into the seasonable
80's.
   The high in Omaha had averaged 92.5 degrees during the spell,
said John Zapotocny, assistant professor of atmospheric sciences at
Creighton University. At midday there were showers and
thunderstorms over parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Ohio and Michigan.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from North Carolina
across South Carolina, Georgia, northwest Florida, Alabama,
Tennessee, Mississippi, southeast Arkansas, Louisiana, parts of
Texas and southeast New Mexico.
   Storms and showers also reached from the North Carolina coast
across eastern Virginia, Delaware, eastern Maryland, southeast
Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey.
   There were scattered showers in central Maine, and southeast
Florida, and rain moved onto the northern coast of Oregon.
   Heavier rainfall Friday included 2.71 inches at Oscoda, Mich.,
1.35 inches at Grand Rapids, Mich., 1.25 inches at Dover, Del.,
1.09 inches at Houghton Lake, Mich., and 1 inch at Millville, N.J.
   Low temperature for the Lower 48 states Friday morning was 29
degrees at Truckee, Calif., West Yellowstone, Mont., and Burgess,
Ind. The Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming reached 22 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 47 at
Marquette, Mich., to 101 at Needles, Calif.

   A 4-year-old girl received an intravenous
injection Friday and made history by becoming the first patient to
receive gene therapy.
   ``The patient is doing beautifully,'' said Dr. French Anderson,
a scientist at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
   ``The family now has new hope for their child,'' said another
researcher, Dr. Kenneth W. Culver of the National Cancer
Institutes.
   During the 28-minute infusion procedure, the girl - who was not
identified - sat up in her bed, played and put stickers on the lab
coats of her doctors.
   ``I'm sure this will be one of the most closely watched human
beings on the face of the earth today,'' said Don Ralbovsky, a
spokesman for the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.,
where the procedure was conducted.
   The therapy involves inserting curative genes into human cells.
Its first therapeutic use was given final approval only hours
before by the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``This is a small but crucial step to treating a whole array of
genetic diseases,'' said Dr. R. Michael Blaese, another cancer
institute researcher on the project.
   Success could lead to use of the procedure against cancer,
hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, AIDS and other diseases in years to
come.
   The child suffers from a rare genetic disease called ADA
Deficiency, which weakens her immune system so that it cannot fight
infection and disease.
   About 1 billion cells - approximately a small thimbleful - were
mixed in a saline solution in the first infusion, which took about
a half hour.
   Anderson said he would not expect to see results for the first
several months but that within a year they should know whether the
treatment is working.
   The National Institutes of Health has approval to treat up to 10
patients with ADA Deficiency. The afflicted children were born with
a gene that does not produce the enzyme adenosine deaminase, or
ADA, which is essential for an immune system to function normally
This leaves them vulnerable to infections and diseases most people
can fight off.
   The best of the current treatments for the 10 children born in
North America each year suffering from the disease, is a bone
marrow transplant with a donor whose tissue type matches the
child's. But most of the children don't have a matched donor, and
success with an unmatched donor is about 50 percent.
   Untreated, children with the disease die within the first two
years of life. They usually don't live into their second decade
even with current treatments.
   Weeks ago, researchers took white cells from some of the
4-year-old's blood and began growing them in tissue culture. Then
they inserted a normal ADA gene into these cells with a genetically
engineered virus. The virus has been disabled and is no longer
infectious, but is a vehicle to get the normal gene into the cells
where it produces the required enzyme.
   Once enough ADA-corrected cells have been grown, they are
infused into the patient intravenously.
   The treatments will be given once a month for about two years.
   The experiment, first proposed by NIH in April 1987, was
recommended for approval by an advisory committee July 31 and was
approved by NIH last week.
   Another gene-therapy experiment, also approved by NIH last week
and awaiting FDA clearance, would treat patients with a lethal form
of skin cancer.

<HEAD>Dukakis Returns, Reclaims State From Lt. Gov.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis closed the book on the
Massachusetts Mutiny on Friday when he returned from a European
trade mission and ended Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy's brief reign as
acting governor.
   There was some consolation for Murphy in the aftermath of an
episode that sunk her foundering race for governor. An aide said
Dukakis would consider adopting some elements of her plan to
restructure the state's frail budget.
   Dukakis said he planned to meet Saturday with assistants to
discuss the state budget, which already is running at a deficit two
months into the fiscal year. He refused to say what action he would
take on Murphy's plans.
   Just a week earlier, Dukakis left Massachusetts under a cloud of
rebellion, with Murphy pledging to seize control of the state's
finances in his absence.
   Murphy, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor,
unveiled her budget plans Sept. 7. But she could not escape charges
that her tactics were designed to bolster her failing campaign.
   Murphy dropped out of the governor's race Monday. She said se
would continue to fight for her plans, contained in executive
orders she signed last week.
   Dukakis, whose popularity has plummeted along with his state's
economy, decided not to run for re-election this year.
   Economic woes were on his mind when he returned from Europe. ``I
will take advice from anybody and everybody who can constructively
participate in this - that includes the lieutenant governor,'' he
said at a news conference at Logan International Airport.
   Murphy said her plans would save the state about $150 million
annually. She called for slashing about 1,000 jobs from the state
workforce and issuing monthly budget reports detailing spending and
revenues.
   Administration officials said they have been complying with the
orders, but also indicated Murphy's plans fit within budget-cutting
measures issued by Dukakis before he left to help offset shrinking
tax collections.
   S. Stephen Rosenfeld, Dukakis' chief of staff, indicated that
parts of Murphy's orders may be included in the final budget cuts.
He said the eventual payroll cuts will ``go well beyond'' the
reductions ordered by Murphy, although he could not specify where
these cuts would occur.
   Rosenfeld said he did not expect Murphy would attend Saturday's
budget session with the governor. Jodi D'Urso, a spokeswoman for
the lieutenant governor, said Murphy was not invited.

<HEAD>California Announces First Toll Roads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's first planned toll roads
were announced Friday, marking the first time that freeway-happy
motorists will face levies on anything but bridges.
   The roads, all privately financed under a new state-approved
program, include a $1.2 billion, 40-mile highway east of San
Francisco and a 10-mile segment in San Diego County near the
Mexican border. Two other projects were approved for Orange County,
just south of Los Angeles.
   All are set for completion by 1997.
   Gov. George Deukmejian also said two backup plans were approved,
in case financing or other problems blocked the toll roads. One
would replace San Francisco's earthquake-damaged Embarcadero
Freeway with an underground highway, and the other would construct
a high-speed train from the Los Angeles International Airport to
Palmdale, in the Mohave Desert.
   ```While privitizing roads is not new in the country,
California's approach is unique because ... the private sector
selects the projects from among those already on a list of planned
future state highways,'' Deukmejian said.
   The toll roads would all be constructed with private funds, with
the state and developers negotiating the tolls before construction
begins. Bob Best, the director of the state Department of
Transportation, told a news conference that he expected tolls to
run between 10 and 20 cents per mile.
   The toll roads program was part of the political compromise that
led to the 9-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax increase approved by
California voters in June.
   The planned toll roads would be:
   -In Orange County, an 11-mile road roughly between Anaheim
Stadium and the John Wayne Airport, and 10 miles of new toll lanes
on the Route 91 freeway to Riverside County.
   -In San Diego County, a new four-lane freeway extending 10 miles
from the Otay Mesa Road near the Mexican border north to State
Route 54 at an estimated cost of $400 million.
   -In Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco, a five- or
six-lane, 40-mile road between Antioch and Interstate 680 near
Sunol.

<HEAD>Dutch Investigating Ship Suspected in Iraqi Supergun Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VLISSINGEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities are investigating the
cargo of an impounded, Iraqi-bound ship suspected earlier of
carrying parts for a ``supergun'' that could fire chemical
warheads, a prosecutor's spokeswoman said Friday.
   The spokeswoman also said Iraqi authorities failed in an effort
to free the ship when a Dutch court refused to hear a lawsuit they
had filed.
   The Bahamian-registered Gur Mariner was seized in the Dutch
North Sea port of Vlissingen on Thursday after customs received a
document identifying the destination of its cargo as Iraq.
   According to Dutch Radio, the ship was carrying pipe segments
for use in oil drilling operations, as well as machine parts and
unidentified chemicals.
   In April, British customs seized a consignment of Iraqi-bound
pipe segments that were on a dock waiting to be picked up by the
Gur Mariner.
   The pipes were believed parts for a 120-foot-long artillery
piece supposedly being built that would be capable of lobbying
shells from Iraqi territory hundreds of miles into Israel.
   Alleged components for the so-called supergun, believed to be
capable of carrying chemical weapons, have since surfaced in
several other European nations.
   Josine Mooijen of the Rotterdam prosecutor's office, which is
investigating the case, told The Associated Press the ship's papers
state its cargo ``in rather vague terms.'' She said the cargo was
being investigated but refused to provide details.
   According to the radio report, the Gur Mariner had picked up
cargo in Bremen, West Germany, and Middlesborough, Britain - where
the piping was seized in April.
   The report said the Gur Mariner was in the Egyptian Suez Canal
port of Port Said when the United Nations declared its trade
embargo against Iraq. The ship then returned to Rotterdam, said the
report.
   It added that a U.S. Navy detachment in the Mediterranean Sea
had tried to chase the ship because of suspicions it sought to
break the U.N. embargo imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   The case came to light on Thursday, when papers submitted to
Dutch customs gave the cargo's destination as Iraq. Investigators
seized the ship under Dutch laws enforcing the U.N. embargo on
Iraq.
   The prosecutor's spokeswoman also said the Iraqi government lost
a lawsuit Thursday against the Gur Mariner's owners, Aza Hara
Maritime Inc. of Panama, within hours of filing the case at a
district court in Middelburg.
   Iraq demanded the ship leave Vlissingen within 48 hours without
unloading its cargo and sail for a port to be specified later, said
Ms. Mooijen.
   She said the court refused to hear the suit because the Gur
Mariner's departure would violate the Dutch sanctions law.
   ``It was a clear-cut, textbook example'' of how that law should
be applied, she said.
   Talal Pachachi, a spokesman for the Iraqi Embassy in The Hague,
said he was unaware of the lawsuit. He refused all comment on the
case.
   A U.S. arms designer suspected of helping Iraq develop the
supergun, Canadian-born Gerald Bull, was assassinated last March in
Brussels, Belgium. The case is unsolved though it is believed a
hired hitmen carried out the assassination.
   Bull also worked on advanced howitzer systems for the U.S. Army.
His technology was used by Israel, South Africa and both sides in
the Iran-Iraq war.

<HEAD>Conferees Approve Tighter Pollution Controls on Factories,
Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators gave formal
approval Friday to a compromise provision of the clean air bill
that would require factories and businesses to tighen controls on
smog-causing pollutants.
   The provisions had tentatively been approved in negotiations
among staff members earlier in the week and had expected to be
endorsed by the House and Senate members.
   The industrial smog measure is part of a much broader clean air
bill that would impose tough new pollution controls on electric
utilities, automobiles and factories, including reductions in
sulfer dioxide and the industrial release of toxic chemicals.
   The agreement would require even small emitters of smog-causing
pollution like dry cleaners, bakeries and furniture makers to
comply with tougher controls by installing new pollution control
equipment.
   The Senate had exempted polluters releasing less than 100 tons
of pollution a year, but the House version - which was adopted by
the conferees - requires compliance by polluters of as little as 25
to 50 tons a year in cities with serious smog problems.
   After the industrial smog section was approved, conferees agreed
to proceed to a section of the massive bill that deals with new
pollution controls on motor vehicles.
   Both the House and Senate approved clean air bills earlier this
year, but the negotiations are aimed at resolving an array of
differences including how much to toughen the pollution controls on
cars, buses and trucks.
   The legislation would be the first strengthening of federal air
pollution controls in 13 years.

<HEAD>President Urges Dominicans to Save Gas, Stay Away from Beach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Joaquin
Balaguer said Friday that Dominicans must ``go to the beach less''
to survive a gasoline shortage and economic crunch from the faceoff
in the Persian Gulf.
   In another effort to solve the country's economic problems, a
top Central Bank official flew to Washington for talks with the
International Monetary Fund. Although there is no current agreement
with the IMF, the government last month imposed unpopular austerity
measures recommended by the fund.
   The Aug. 13 measures devalued the Dominican peso and increased
prices for food and gasoline, touching off protests and strikes
that left 12 people dead and 50 wounded in clashes with police.
   On Friday, Balaguer said Dominicans must ``tighten their belts''
to live with the recent measures and fight 70 percent inflation
afflicting this Caribbean nation of 6.7 million people.
   ``We've got to tighten our belts and think about our country,''
Balaguer said. ``We have to use less gas, go out less, go to the
beach less. We must appeal to Dominican patriotism so that we can
overcome this crisis.''
   Luis Toral, governor of the Central Bank, was to meet with IMF
officials next week in Washington, but the country was not expected
to sign an agreement immediately.
   The Dominican Republic is in arrears on most of its $4 billion
foreign debt because it cannot make the payments. Economists say
without an IMF accord, it cannot get new loans or credits to
reschedule the debt.
   Balaguer said two weeks ago he would not sign an accord that
``imposes obligations which we cannot meet.'' The last IMF accord
in 1984 led to protests that left 100 dead in three days of
rioting.
   On Thursday, the government imposed another gasoline price
increase, from about 89 cents a gallon to $1.42. It also announced
30 to 40 percent cuts in oil imports.
   Balaguer said he had no alternative because of the oil crisis
caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. ``The country has no other
choice but to pay for petroleum at the current prices or reduce its
consumption,'' Balaguer said Friday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate cleared the way Friday for action
on a bill that would require automakers to dramatically increase
fuel economy.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he hoped
to have a vote late next week on the bill that would require
automakers to increase average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles
per gallon by 1995 and to 40 miles per gallon by 2001.
   Supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements would
save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day once they go fully into
effect, but key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure
on the Senate floor.
   Within hours of the vote, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner blasted the legislation as ``unrealistic, irresponsible
and, more important, unattainable.'' He said there's no technology
to achieve the bill's goals without making cars smaller.
   ``It should be called the highway fatality bill,'' Skinner said
at a news conference, citing a new study by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration that concluded a clear link between
reducing the size of cars and traffic deaths.
   The NHTSA study said the introduction of smaller cars over the
past decade had resulted in an estimated 1,340 additional traffic
deaths annually in single-car accidents. Based on those numbers,
NHTSA Administrator Jerry Curry said between 600 and 1,140
additional deaths annually can be expected if automakers try to
meet the 40 mile per gallon standard.
   Skinner said automakers had convinced him that the Senate bill's
fuel economy goals can't be achieved without substantial weight
reductions in cars.
   Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator in the Carter
adminstration and now president of Public Citizen, a consumer
group, disputed claims that cars necessarily will have to be made
smaller to burn less fuel.
   She cited a Transportation Department research vehicle built in
the 1970s that achieved 43 mpg despite providing improved
protection to occupants than conventional cars.
   ``We've just had the first inning of this nine-inning game,''
Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said after the Senate voted 68-28 to
clear the way for debate.
   ``We hope and intend to win this fight,'' Riegle said, adding
that he doubts supporters will get the needed 60 votes to cut off
debate and bring it to a vote next week.
   A similar bill has been introduced in the House, but it has yet
to be taken up by the Energy and Commerce Committee, whose
chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., is staunchly opposed to the
measure.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sponsor of the House bill, said
earlier this week she would try to push the legislation directly on
the House floor in an effort to bypass Dingell's committee.
   But the Senate's 68-28 vote Friday to cut off efforts by Riegle
to keep the measure off the Senate floor was an indication of the
growing support in Congress for a measure to reduce U.S. reliance
on foreign oil, a subject in the spotlight since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``It's the single most important step to reducing our dependency
on OPEC oil and curbing global warming,'' the Sierra Club said of
the bill sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
   In floor debate, Riegle said those fuel savings aren't likely to
begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to today's oil
crisis might be to return to a national speed limit of 55 miles an
hour.
   Later, a Riegle aide said the senator didn't necessarily support
a change in the speed limit.
   Bryan described his bill as a message to Detroit and the
automakers ``that they're going to have to look at fuel economy and
not just muscle cars.''
   ``It does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we don't
start conserving now, some future president may have to consider
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the Middle
East,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poland Says Soviets to Cut Oil Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The central Soviet government intends to
completely cut off oil shipments to Poland next year and recommends
that officials seek supplies from individual republics, a Polish
official was quoted as saying.
   Polish officials, who are also contending with the loss of about
1 million tons of Iraqi oil because of the U.N. embargo, have been
looking for new supply sources.
   ``Instead of the 13 million tons of oil which Poland has been
getting annually ... the supplies proposed for 1991 will amount to
zero,'' said government Minister Jerzy Osiatynski, head of the
Central Planning Office of the Solidarity-led government. He was
quoted in a statement carried late Thursday by the PAP news agency.
   He said Polish negotiators heard the news during talks held Aug.
28-31 by delegations of the two countries.
   ``The Soviet side suggested that in order to get any oil
supplies, Poland should establish direct contact and cooperation
with the republics and distributors interested in this,'' said
Osiatynski in the statement.
   He said Polish officials followed the advice immediately but
gave no indication whether Poland had succeeded in finding sellers.
   Poland has traditionally relied on the Soviet Union for low-cost
oil for almost all its needs. In 1991, for the first time, Soviet
and Polish trade was to have been conducted on a hard-currency
basis with Poland paying market prices for oil.
   Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, asked about the
reported cutoff at a news conference Friday, said negotiations
continue ``but we cannot be too optimistic'' about substantial
supplies.
   In addition to oil cutbacks, the Soviet negotiators also said
that supplies of natural gas sold to Poland will be reduced from
this year's level of more than 8.2 billion cubic meters to 5.2
billion cubic meters.
   Deliveries of Soviet oil to Poland so far this year have been
running up to 50 percent behind schedule, the government has said.
   Gasoline prices were increased by an average of 30 percent on
Sept. 1 to curb demand and cover the added cost of supplies.

   Hundreds of couples said `I do' before
a court clerk who should have said `I can't.''
   The clerk was not legally sworn in to administer marriages, but
the weddings are legally binding anyway, Attorney General Joseph
Curran said.
   ``I want to reassure any couple that may have been married in
Howard County by the employee that the marriage is valid,'' Curran

   Circuit Court Clerk C. Merritt Pumphrey said he deputized two of

   ``I just chose not to,'' Pumphrey said.
   Pumphrey said he thought he didn't need to formally deputize
Pannebecker, who has conducted hundreds of weddings in the last
four years, because she was authorized by an administrative judge
to become a deputy clerk.
   Assistant Attorney General Julia Freit said that Maryland law
clearly states that only deputized employees can perform weddings.
   ``I highly recommended that Pannebecker absolutely perform no
further marriages,'' she said Thursday, adding that Pumphrey has
been notified that employees conducting marriages must be formally
sworn in for each four-year administrative term.
   Pumphrey said Friday he has not decided whether to deputize
Pannebecker. She was on vacation and could not be reached for
comment Friday.
   Couples were assured that their marriages will not be
questioned. Some were mollified.
   ``I only live a few minutes away and I don't mind going back and
doing it again,'' said Mark Cochran, 29, who was married in June.
``But in my mind, I was married on that day.''
   Others in this Baltimore suburb remained angry.
   ``If we have to do it again it should be on Howard County's
bill,'' said Jill Huston, 30, who was married in January.
   Curran said a 1925 Maryland Court of Appeals ruling would
validate the marriages.
   The high court ruled that a couple's marriage was legal although
the minister lacked authority from his church to conduct wedding
ceremonies, concluding the union was valid because the couple
believed the minister was qualified.
   ``It logically follows that the Court would reach the same
conclusion with respect to a marriage performed by a supposed
public official,'' Curran said.

<HEAD>Carter's Former Pilot Freed After Years In Iranian Prison</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with four grafs to UPDATE with Rabhan's arrival in
Atlanta. Picks up 5th graf, `I look...'.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A Savannah businessman who once worked as a pilot
for former President Carter arrived in the United States on Friday
after spending about a decade in prison in Iran.
   E. David Rabhan had been arrested during a business trip to Iran
and charged with spying for the CIA, a charge both he and Carter
denied.
   Attorney Phillips Hamilton said family members believed the
64-year-old Rabhan left Tehran late Thursday on a flight to Zurich,
Switzerland.
   Rabhan arrived in Atlanta on Friday but he was whisked away for
a private meeting with Carter, who has worked for years for his
freedom.
   ``I look forward to being reunited with a friend,'' Carter told
The Atlanta Journal. ``He's really an extraordinary person. I'm
very proud of David.''
   Rabhan's mother, Frances, reached in Savannah, praised Carter
for his efforts to win her son's release.
   ``I'm not going to let him talk to you though - I'm going to
keep him to myself,'' Mrs. Rabhan said in a telephone interview.
``President Carter has been like another son to me - you can't have
a better friend.''
   Rabhan's sister, Joan Jacobson, told The Philadelphia Inquirer
that Iranian authorities had agreed Sept. 3 to allow Rabhan to
leave the country. He was reportedly released from Iran's Evin
Prison on Aug. 6 and issued an exit visa Thursday, hours before
boarding the flight to Switzerland.
   The Swiss Embassy, through which the U.S. government maintains
contact with Iran, would not confirm the Inquirer's report, which
said Swiss authorities looked after Rabhan's interests and
guaranteed he would not flee before being given a visa to leave
Iran.
   Rabhan went to Iran in the mid-1970s to begin a business using a
fish protein concentrate to make breads and snack foods. Various
reports have listed his arrest date as 1981 and 1979. The exact
date could not immediately be determined.
   ``He was a prisoner. He was never a spy. He never had any kind
of connection with the CIA or with any sort of espionage or
spying,'' Carter said.
   Rabhan was imprisoned with another American, John Pattis of
Aiken, S.C., said Pattis' sister, Ellen. Pattis, a
telecommunications engineer who is accused of spying, apparently
remained in Evin after Rabhan's release.
   Rabhan's relationship with Carter dates to at least 1970, when
Rabhan volunteered his services as a pilot during Carter's second
campaign for governor of Georgia.
   After leaving the presidency, Carterdescribed Rabhan as a
``hostage,'' but neither the Reagan nor Bush administrations
considered him a hostage and his plight went largely unreported.
   Mrs. Rabhan objected to calling her son a hostage.
   ``He was a prisoner, but he was not a hostage,'' she said.
``Nothing was offered for him and that made it harder (to win his
release).''
   According to letters he managed to get out of Iran, Rabhan was
physically abused and his weight once fell by 44 pounds. He spent
part of his imprisonment in solitary confinement in a windowless
cell, the letters said.
   ``His physical condition is good,'' said Ms. Jacobson, who said
she has spoken to her brother by phone.
   Pattis, 53, was arrested after the satellite ground
communications system he was working on was bombed by Iraq in 1986
during the gulf war.

   Iraq turned up the heat Friday on diplomats refusing to leave
embassies in occupied Kuwait, while Western nations promised more
soldiers, tanks and ships for the military machine confronting
Iraq.
   American troops fired a warning shot at an Iraqi tanker, then
boarded it briefly before allowing it to proceed when they found it
held no ``prohibited cargo,'' a U.S. Navy spokesman said. Americans
troops fired twice before at Iraqi ships and boarded another on
Sept. 4, when a tea-laden Iraqi-flagged freighter refused to divert
its course.
   In Kuwait, Iraqi troops stormed the French ambassador's
residence, seizing four citizens, including a diplomat, the French
Foreign Ministry said. Troops also burst into the Belgian compound
and the Canadian ambassador's residence.
   The consuls from the United States and four other nations were
briefly detained.
   The incidents were the most serious confrontations involving
diplomats in the emirate since Iraq ordered the embassies closed
Aug 24.
   President Bush said the raids and brief detention of the
American consul, who represents U.S. interests in Kuwait City, were
a ``clear violation of international law.''
   Iraq denied its soldiers entered the foreign compounds, which it
referred to as ``former diplomatic missions.'' The official Iraqi
News Agency said the troops were under strict orders not to enter
the compounds.
   At least 17 embassies in Kuwait have defied an Iraqi order to
close, and Baghdad has tried to make life insufferable for
diplomats, in several cases surrounding the missions with troops
and cutting off power and water.
   After the raid on the French compound, French President Francois
Mitterrand called an emergency Cabinet meeting for Saturday. He
said the Iraqi move ``is an aggression, and we will respond to
it.''
   While Iraq bore down on defiant diplomats, military pressure
built on Iraq.
   Britain said Friday it would send an armored brigade of more
than 120 tanks and 6,000 combat troops to the Persian Gulf. British
Defense Secretary Tom King said another squadron of Tornado ground
attack aircraft and additional air defense aircraft would also be
sent.
   The British forces mark the first dispatch of tanks and
significant ground troops by any Western country besides the United
States since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subsequent annexation of
oil-wealthy Kuwait.
   Canada on Friday committed a dozen fighter jets and a total of
450 fliers and ground crew. ``This is not a conflict between Arabs
and the West, nor is it a conflict between Iraq and the United
States,'' said Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. ``It is
Saddam Hussein against the civilized world.''
   Several other nations, including West Germany, Italy, Belgium
and South Korea, pledged either money or equipment Friday to
support the multinational contingent in the gulf.
   Japan, facing allegations it has been too tightfisted during the
crisis, pledged $3 billion on top of $1 billion in non-military
aid.
   Meanwhile, the U.N. sanctions on trade with Iraq were taking
their toll on the Iraqi economy. The ruling Baath Party newspaper
Al-Tharwa said that starting Saturday, Iraqis will be limited to
three pieces of bread a day. Rationing of sugar, rice, cooking oil,
soap and detergent began in some neighborhoods earlier this month.
   The 6-week-old Middle East crisis also was taking its toll on
the U.S. economy. The government announced Friday that wholesale
prices shot up 1.3 percent in August.
   The Labor Department blamed virtually the entire increase on
higher oil costs since Iraq's invasion, which led to a 4 million
barrel daily shortfall of oil worldwide and pushed fuel prices up
by about 20 percent. Oil prices moved higher Friday, to $32 a
barrel.
   Bush, meanwhile, asked Congress for $1.9 billion more to cover
the costs of deploying the 150,000 U.S. troops in the Middle East.
Operation Desert Shield is costing Washington an estimated $1
billion a month, officials have said.
   Iraq has massed an estimated 265,000 troops along or near
Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia since Saddam sent his forces into
the emirate in a dispute over oil, land and money.
   Saudi officers have told of hundreds of Iraqis defecting from
the forces in Kuwait. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the U.S.
commander in Saudi Arabia, said Friday he had no solid numbers but
was sure some had abandoned their posts.
   He said some were sent back with food and water and told to
convey the message that ``things are pretty good over here.''
   The raids on the diplomatic compounds in Kuwait appeared
designed to intimidate diplomats who have remained in their
embassies to symbolize their rejection of Iraq's annexation of
Kuwait. The diplomats also are trying to provide some protection
for their citizens trapped there.
   Iraqi soldiers forced their way into the French ambassador's
residence early Friday and seized four French citizens, including
the military attache. The diplomat was later released, but the
whereabouts of the other three was not known.
   At the Canadian compound, troops entered and briefly detained
the consuls from the United States, Britain, Ireland, Australia and
Canada, who were meeting there. Canada issued a formal protest with
Iraq.
   Soldiers also entered Belgium's diplomatic compound in Kuwait
and ordered the two remaining diplomats to leave, officials said in
Brussels. The soldiers left after the diplomats fled to the
ambassador's residence nearby.
   A day earlier, the Dutch government announced a similar incident
at its diplomatic residence in Kuwait but refused to provide
details or say when the incursion occurred.
   About 2,200 Americans remain captive in Iraq and Kuwait, and
some Western men have been transferred to strategic Iraqi
installations to deter attacks by Western forces. Many Western
women and children have been allowed to leave Iraq and Kuwait on
chartered flights in recent weeks.
   An Iraqi Airways Boeing 747 chartered by the U.S. government
flew 382 foreigners, most of them Americans, to London, the British
Foreign Office said. They were to depart for Baltimore on Saturday.
   Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Arab and Asian nations
have fled Iraq and Kuwait though Jordan and Turkey, straining the
already tight resources of both nations.
   In a late-night session Thursday, the U.N. Security Council
voted 13-2 on the U.S.-sponsored resolution to allow food shipments
to Iraq only to alleviate ``human suffering.'' Cuba and Yemen
opposed the measure, saying all food should be allowed in.
   Early Friday, the council's committee on sanctions approved a
request by India to send a ship loaded with 11,000 tons of food to
Kuwait to feed about 120,000 stranded Indian citizens.
   U.S. diplomatic efforts to isolate Iraq moved ahead. Secretary
of State James A. Baker III met with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
Syria, Iraq's archenemy, is likely to send 15,000 more troops to
the gulf, Western diplomatic sources said Friday on condition of
anonymity. Syria has 3,000 soldiers in Saudi Arabia and 1,000 in
the United Arab Emirates as part of the multinational force.
   In other developments:
   -The West German government - prevented by its constitution from
deploying forces outside the NATO area - said it had given the
United States a list of more than 50 merchant ships that could be
used to transport American troops to the gulf.
   -The Norwegian government offered to help carry fuel and
supplies to U.S. warships enforcing the economic sanctions and
increase its aid to refugees fleeing the crisis to about $11
million.
   - Italy said it would send an additional warship and eight
Tornado fighter-planes to the gulf region. Italy already has
contributed five ships.
   - Saudi officers have told of hundreds of Iraqis defecting from
the forces in Kuwait. Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander in Saudi
Arabia, said Friday he had no solid numbers but was sure some had
abandoned their posts.
   He said some were sent back with food and water and told to
convey the message that ``things are pretty good over here.''

<HEAD>Republicans Say Leaks Are Threatening Budget Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry Republican budget negotiators accused
Democrats on Friday of giving reporters details of privately
offered GOP tax proposals and said the disclosures were threatening
deficit-reduction talks.
   ``We are trying to do a difficult job in cooperation with our
Democratic colleagues,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
said on the Senate floor. ``It is not going to work if this garbage
keeps piling up day after day.''
   Dole spoke as bargainers began their second week of confidential
talks at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, just outside
Washington. They spent much of Friday's session complaining about
the leaks, said one official who asked to not be identified.
   ``The mood was basically ill-will,'' the official said.
   After a spurt of movement earlier in the week toward a package
saving $50 billion next year and $500 billion through 1995,
progress has slowed.
   ``Up and down like a roller coaster,'' was how President Bush
described the talks.
   Republican leaders angrily took to the Senate floor Friday after
some reporters obtained copies of analyses of tax proposals
Democrats and Republicans have made at the negotiations.
   The Associated Press received the data from sources who demanded
anonymity.
   The studies - performed by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Tax
Committee - showed that GOP tax proposals would raise taxes by $4.1
billion on people who earn $50,000 a year or less. They would cut
taxes by $11 billion on those with higher incomes.
   The analysis said the proportionately largest tax increase - 2.6
percent - would go to people who earn less than $10,000 annually.
The biggest tax cut, 5.5 percent, would go to those who earn
$200,000 or more a year.
   The Democratic plan would cut taxes by $4 billion for people
earning $20,000 or less annually, and boost them by $26.8 billion
by anyone else, the study said. People with incomes surpassing
$200,000 yearly would shoulder the greatest burden, a 6.7 percent
tax boost.
   Republicans complained that the disclosures of confidential
proposals are designed to make the GOP look bad.
   ``There is a deliberate effort by some on the other side ... to
cast this as Republicans for the rich and they are for everybody
else,'' Dole said. ``I am not certain we ought to continue to
negotiate on this basis.''
   GOP lawmakers also warned that the leaks could make it harder
for a budget-cutting plan to be crafted.
   ``We have to make some tough choices, and so occasionally
somebody puts a very tough proposition on the table,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``That's courage. But there won't be much
courage out there if the next day that tough proposition is all
over the country.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, condemned the
leaks but added: ``The leaks have not all been one way.''
   One of the biggest remaining disputes is over the Bush plan to
slash the capital gains tax rate.
   The president wants to drop the maximum tax rate on sales of
property from 33 percent to 15 percent, a move he says will
increase government revenues by encouraging transactions. Democrats
say the idea is a money-loser whose main beneficiaries would be the
wealthy, and are demanding higher income tax rates on the rich in
return.
   The Republicans have proposed a penny-a-gallon tax on all
petroleum products except feedstock and limiting the deductibility
of state and local income taxes to $10,000.
   Democrats have suggested an 11-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax
increase and a 4 percent tax on other forms of energy above its
current level of 9 cents.
   Both sides have offered to tax luxury items such as expensive
cars and to increase alcohol and tobacco levies.
   The negotiators planned to take Saturday off and return to work
Sunday.

<HEAD>Two Ethnic Albanians Die in Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more ethnic Albanians were
killed overnight and another policeman seriously injured in rising
violence in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, police said
Friday.
   Meanwhile, Belgrade television reported the arrest of an
unspecified number of ethnic Albanian deputies to the disbanded
Kosovo parliament who had taken part in an illegal meeting this
month.
   A police statment, carried by the state news agency Tanjug, said
the violence occurred when a police patrol tried to stop a car on a
road near Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
   The occupants of the vehicle reportedly opened fire, seriously
injuring one policeman. The other policeman returned fire and
killed the two attackers, both members of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, which is struggling for autonomy from Serbia.
   The deaths brought the number of ethnic Albanians killed the
past 24 hours to four. Three policeman have been injured. Serbs
dominate the security forces following Serbia's assumption of
direct rule in Kosovo and the firing of thousands of ethnic
Albanian policemen.
   Police raided an ethnic Albanian village north of Pristina in
search of arms Thursday, prompting a gun battle that left two
Albanians dead and two policemen wounded, according to Tanjug.
   More than 60 ethnic Albanians have died in clashes since March
1989, when Serbia severely curbed the self-rule Kosovo enjoyed
under the 1974 constitution.
   Serbia says the measures were needed to protect the Slav
minority in Kosovo, an ancient Serbian heartland, from ethnic
Albanian harassment.
   On Thursday, Tanjug reported that Kosovo's parliament, dissolved
by Serbia after it proclaimed independence in early July, met
secretly Sept. 7, adopting a constitution and proclaiming a
separate republic of Kosovo. It said 111 deputies attended the
session.
   Belgrade television said police, acting on orders from Serbian
authorities, on Friday detained ``a number of deputies'' who have
taken part in the ``illegal'' parliamentary session, and are
looking for other delegates who will face criminal charges for
``hostile activities against the state.''
   The declaration has no legal validity, Serbian authorities said.
They called for ``tough legal action'' against ethnic Albanian
``nationalists and separatists'' who took part in the session.
   Serbian authorities claim ethnic Albanians are seeking to merge
Kosovo with neighboring Albania.
   The six Yugoslav republics are virtually independent states.
According to the nation's constitution, they can declare
independence from Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Police Chief Mack Vines pleaded innocent to
perjury Friday, telling reporters the charge was the result of a
``misunderstanding.''
   Vines, who was fired after his indictment Wednesday, said he
hopes to remain in law enforcement somewhere in the Dallas area.
   District Judge Joe Kendall said he would move the trial from
Dallas because of publicity. He allowed Vines to remain free on his
own recognizance.
   ``Frankly, Chief, I don't believe that you can get a fair trial
in this town,'' Kendall said.
   Vines is accused of lying to a panel that investigated the
firing of a police officer who shot an unarmed Mexican man to death
last year. An administrative judge ordered the officer, Patrick
LeMaire, reinstated this summer, but LeMaire did not return to the
Dallas force.
   The misdemeanor perjury charge alleges that Vines lied to the
panel about a conversation he had with his assistant, Greg
Holliday, on Aug. 2.
   Holliday said Vines called him the night before he was scheduled
to appear before the panel and tried to influence his testimony.
Vines told the panel he had not discussed testimony before the
panel with anyone.
   Holliday told City Manager Jan Hart about the conversation and
she suspended both men with pay. Holliday later was reinstated.
   Vines said he was taken aback by his firing, since he thought
the police department was making progress in community relations
under his leadership. He had been police chief for two years.
   ``I felt that we were going along well and mending bridges and
building new bridges,'' he said.

   Investigators seized an apartment
that was used by the outlawed Irish Republican Army in West
Germany, prosecutors said Friday.
   The abandoned apartment was found last week, but no arrests were
made, said Hans-Juergen Foerster, a spokesman for the Federal
Prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe. Foerster declined to say how
authorities discovered the apartment had been rented by the IRA.
   But security officials in Hanover said investigators traced the
apartment through a set of keys confiscated from an IRA suspect
arrested in the Netherlands this summer.
   The officials, who spoke on condition they not be named,
declined to identify the suspect by name or provide details, other
than that he rented the apartment pretending to be an American.
   The IRA has carried out a series of attacks against the British
military in Western Europe as part of its campaign to end British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   On June 2, British Army Maj. Michael John Dillon-Lee was shot to
death as he returned to his home in Dortmund, 145 miles south of
Hanover.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Holds First High-Level Meeting with Israelis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met two Israeli
ministers Friday in the highest-level contact between the two
countries since the Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations in
1967.
   Gorbachev met in the Kremlin with Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai
and Science Minister Yuval Neeman, the official news agency Tass
said.
   The Israeli delegation, invited by the Soviet Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, reportedly is discussing plans to build a
passenger plane with Soviet, Israeli and U.S. participation. The
Israelis also reportedly had a proposal to send Israeli produce to
the Moscow area.
   Modai belongs to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc. Neeman, a nuclear scientist and longtime head of
Israel's space agency, leads the ultra-rightist Tehiya Party.
   Shamir aide Avi Pazner said in Israel that it was the first time
an Israeli minister had met a Soviet leader since ties were broken
after the Middle East war.
   Over the last three years, the two countries have exchanged
diplomatic missions and relations have improved.
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze were to meet this month during the U.N. General
Assembly in New York, possibly to discuss restoration of full
diplomatic relations.
   Jewish emigration to Israel from the Soviet Union has vastly
expanded in recent years - 150,000 Soviet immigrants are expected
this year alone. Soviet support for its former Arab clients, such
as Iraq, has diminished.
   Gorbachev mentioned the plane program on Soviet television after
his meeting this week with President Bush.
   American oil tycoon Armand Hammer is backing the program, in
which Soviet-made Ilyushin-96 and Tupolev-144 aircraft would be
refitted in Israel with Israeli-designed avionics and U.S.-built
engines.
   Hammer, 92, who has close personal ties with many Soviet
leaders, said the first prototype could be ready by 1995.

<HEAD>Palestinian Guerrilla Leaders Arrive in Amman in Major Shift</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two leftist Palestinian guerrilla leaders
arrived in the capital Friday on their first official visit in 20
years to attend a conference expected to produce a declaration of
support for Iraq.
   Their arrival marks a major shift in Jordan's ties with radical
Palestinian factions, which had been banned for two decades in this
moderate kingdom.
   One of the leaders, George Habash, heads the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, the second-largest faction in the
Palestine Liberation Organization. He was in Jordan briefly last
week on his way to Iraq but did not meet with any officials.
   The other, Nayef Hawatmeh, heads the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine. That faction ranks third after Habash's
and Fatah, the mainstream group headed by PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat.
   Hawatmeh drove in Friday from Damascus, Syria, and Habash flew
in from Baghdad, Iraq.
   They were to attend this weekend's conference of leftist
organizations from throughout the Arab world, a PLO official said.
The conference is expected to result in a declaration of support
for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in his confrontation with
U.S.-led forces in the Persian Gulf.
   Hawatmeh will spend a few days in Jordan before traveling to
neighboring Iraq, the PLO official said without being more
specific.
   Palestinian sources have said Habash, who spent nearly two weeks
in Iraq, has moved his headquarters to Baghdad after a falling-out
with his former Syrian backers.
   Syria, Iraq's archrival, has committed thousands of troops to
the U.S.-led buildup against Iraq. Jordan has refused to provide
soldiers and tried to settle the crisis with diplomacy.
   It is not clear if Hawatmeh, who had been cautious not to commit
himself either way on the gulf issue, also has important
differences with Syria.
   His criticism of Saddam after the annexation of Kuwait had led
to a mutiny in his ranks by members who demanded unequivocal
support of Iraq in line with the PLO mainstream.
   During their stay in Jordan, the two Marxist leaders will confer
with King Hussein and other Jordanian and Palestinian leaders.
   Hawatmeh, 57, and Habash, 64, had not visited Jordan since the
1970 clashes between Hussein's Bedouin army and the guerrillas. One
of the main causes of the showdown, widely known as ``Black
September,'' was the hijacking of three airliners by Habash's
guerrillas.
   Although they are radicals, the two guerrilla leaders have been
committed to Arafat's policies to renounce terrorism and recognize
Israel's right to exist. That put them more in harmony with
Jordan's stand on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   In addition, the refusal of Jordan to join in the military
buildup against Iraq has bolstered Jordanian relations with the
PLO.
   More than half of Jordan's 3.1 million people come from
Palestinian families. They fled their homeland after creation of
the Jewish state in 1948 and the 1967 Israeli occupation of West
Bank and Gaza Strip.

   Britain's ambassador has held talks with
Lebanon's leading Shiite Moslem cleric on a plan for swapping
Anglican church envoy Terry Waite for a Shiite cleric held by
Israel, a magazine reported Friday.
   Al-Shiraa magazine said the talks were held Wednesday between
Ambassador David Thathem and Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah and focused
on ``details of releasing the British hostage Terry Waite in return
for the release of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.''
   The story was not attributed to any source.
   Al-Shiraa received international attention for breaking the
story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in 1986 in return for the
release of American hostages.
   Its recent reports on Western captives held mainly by
pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon have not been accurate.
   Fadlallah, the reputed mentor of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, called the magazine report ``a lie.''
   The British Embassy in Lebanon could not be reached for comment.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said: ``I don't even know
whether the ambassador did meet him. It's possible. The ambassador
is engaged on a whole series of calls there - he doesn't report
them all. It sounds like pure speculation to me.''
   The magazine said: ``The British ambassador asked Fadlallah to
give him time to consult the British government on the offer.
Thathem was given 10 days to come back with the British reply.'' It
gave no other details.
   Helicopter-borne Israeli troops kidnapped Obeid, a Hezbollah
cleric, from his southern Lebanon village of Jibsheet in 1989.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for the various
Shiite factions holding most of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Waite, 51, personal emissary of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, disappeared on Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut
hotel for a rendezvous with hostage holders.
   No group has claimed his kidnapping. Former Irish hostage Brian
Keenan said shortly after his release last month that he has seen
Waite.
   The Western captives held in Lebanon, in addition to Waite, are
three other Britons, six Americans, two West Germans and an
Italian.
   Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Iraqi troops raided the diplomatic compounds of
France, Canada and Belgium in Kuwait on Friday, briefly detaining
five Western consuls, capturing four French citizens and provoking
calls for retaliation.
   One of the four, France's military attache, was freed after
several hours. French President Francois Mitterrand called an
emergency Cabinet meeting for Saturday, saying the raid ``is an
aggression, and we will respond to it.''
   ``We will have to decide and show very clearly our
obligations,'' Mitterrand said.
   Iraq's official news agency denied Iraqi soldiers stormed the
compounds, which it referred to as ``former diplomatic missions in
the province of Kuwait.'' Since invading and annexing Kuwait in
August, Iraq has referred to it as an Iraqi province.
   Iraq's ambassador to France, Abdul Razzak al Hachimi, accused
the French in a television interview of seeking a pretext to
escalate tensions.
   Daniel Bernard, spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry,
responded to the Iraqi comments: ``It would suffice to see the
state of the ambassador's residence, which was completely sacked
and pillaged by Iraqi soldiers.''
   There was no word on the fate of the three French civilians
seized with the attache, Col. Edouard Crespin. They had been hiding
in the embassy compound to avoid being taken hostage.
   The Canadian Embassy in Paris said special Iraqi forces entered
the ambassador's residence, which is part of the compound, before
dawn. The consul was briefly detained but later released, along
with consuls from the United States, Ireland, Britain and
Australia, according to a Canadian diplomat in Washington.
   The consuls had been meeting to discuss the evacuation of
additional Westerners from Kuwait, said the diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Belgian officials said three Iraqi soldiers entered Belgium's
diplomatic compound and ordered the two remaining diplomats to
leave the embassy. The soldiers left after the diplomats fled into
the ambassador's adjacent residence.
   The Belgian Foreign Ministry said the intrusion was ``an
unacceptable act going against all international laws.''
   The Netherlands disclosed that Iraqi troops had forced their way
into its ambassador's residence in Kuwait earlier this week. It
said Iraq's ambassador was summoned to hear a ``sharp protest.''
   France vigorously protested the Iraqi action, and the European
Community called it ``intolerable.'' French political leaders
demanded retaliation, and some called for an emergency session of
the U.N. Security Council.
   No specific moves were discussed, but there was speculation a
response could entail the Iraqi Embassy in Paris, which is still
operating normally.
   NATO chief Manfred Woerner, on an official visit to Poland,
called the incursion into the French compound ``another outrageous
violation of international law.''
   In Brussels, the European Community called on Iraq to release
the French citizens and respect the 1961 Vienna Convention on the
inviolability of diplomatic missions.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and later annexed the
oil-rich nation, Baghdad ordered embassies in Kuwait closed, saying
the nation was part of Iraq territory. Iraqi troops surrounded the
missions, and power and water were cut to many in an effort to
force their closure, but 17 embassies have defied the Iraqi order.
   American and British officials denied rumors their embassies had
also been attacked.
   ``We have been in contact with the embassy and reports that
troops overran the embassy are not true,'' said a State Department
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The situation
hasn't changed since yesterday. Water and electricity are cut off
but they have supplies.''
   The staffs of more than 30 other foreign missions have left
since the Aug. 24 deadline, but some of the countries insist their
embassies technically remain open.
   The French Foreign Ministry said troops entered the residence of
the French ambassador about 7 a.m. Friday, taking Crespin and three
others to an undisclosed location.
   Iraqi authorities had earlier cut off water and electricity to
the French Embassy in Kuwait and at one point knocked down part of
its wall. The ambassador's residence and the embassy are separate
buildings.
   The French ambassador has been out of Kuwait since the invasion
and a half-dozen diplomats continue to staff the French Embassy,
headed by the charge d'affaires, Jean-Pierre Galtier.
   ``This is a very serious violation of the Vienna Convention,'' a
French Foreign Ministry spokesman said. ``This is a new intolerable
attack to international rights and the integrity of the person.''
   The Persian Gulf crisis reversed 15 years of close ties between
Iraq and France, which had been Baghdad's top Western arms supplier
and a major trading partner.
   Since the crisis began, France has sent the second-largest naval
force to the region after the United States to help enforce U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
   France has an estimated 400 citizens remaining in Iraq and
Kuwait.

   Searchers waded through
alligator-infested swamps and scoured dense woods in humid
90-degree heat Friday, looking for evidence in the grisly slayings
of five college students.
   Searchers looking for body parts and other evidence concentrated
on wilderness areas near the three apartments where the bodies of
five students were found slain almost three weeks ago.
   Rusty knives, metal, paper products and clothing were among the
items found. Officials said it will take lab work and analysis to
determine if they are connected to the slayings.
   ``It's right on target,'' police Lt. Sadie Darnell said of the
searches that ended Friday afternoon.
   Polk County authorities, meanwhile, announced that the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement had taken ``body samples'' from
Stephen Bates, 30, a burglary suspect jailed in Bartow.
   Bates is one of the two suspects publicly identified by police.
Six other people also are considered suspects.
   Near the Williamsburg Apartments, Gainesville police and Navy
searchers combed dense woods 30 yards behind the apartment where
the bodies of the first two victims - Sonja Larson, 18, and
Christina Powell, 17 - were found Aug. 26.
   Similar searches were going on behind the Gatorwood Apartments,
about a mile away, where the bodies of Manny Taboada, 23, and Tracy
Paules, 23, were found Aug. 28, and outside the apartment where
Christa Hoyt, 18, was slain.
   At the Williamsburg site, searchers kept a close watch for a
4{-foot-long alligator that slithered away when they came near.
   Searchers using dogs, metal detectors and probes examined
Hogtown Creek and wooded areas Thursday around the Hawaiian Village
Apartment where suspect Edward Lewis Humphrey lived.
   Investigators already have taken blood and hair samples from him
at the Brevard County Jail, where he has been held since days after
the slayings on unrelated charges that he beat up his grandmother.
   ``We have a lot of information on Mr. Humphrey, but we have not
connected him to these murders,'' Darnell said.
   While the search continued for evidence and suspects, two agents
from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement were attempting to
find the source of leaks to the news media from the 175-person task
force investigating the killings.
   Investigators have complained that the leaks, particularly about
the crime scenes and the mutilation of the bodies, have hampered
their investigation.
   ``The damage to the investigation has not been extensive, but
there has been some,'' Darnell said.
   Lie-detector tests may be used, and those found to have given
out unauthorized information could face disciplinary action and
criminal charges, Darnell said.
   ``We are taking this very seriously,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials have suspended their effort
to scrap a 1975 General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with
racism because they need Arab support in the Persian Gulf,
diplomats said Friday.
   The United States is trying to avoid aggravating Arab animosity
toward Israel at a time when it needs Arab support to forge a
united front against Iraq, the diplomats said on condition of
anonymity.
   U.S. officials are not expected to raise the Zionism issue in
the next session of the General Assembly, which opens Tuesday.
Instead, the session is expected to be dominated by the gulf
crisis.
   Ronald I. Spiers, undersecretary-general for General Assembly
affairs, told reporters Friday that he had ``seen no sign'' of a
U.S. initiative to repeal the Zionism resolution. Israel and its
ally, the United States, view the measure as a symbol of U.N.
antipathy toward Israel.
   He said that, given the Persian Gulf crisis, it is unlikely the
United States would turn its attention to the Zionism resolution
unless it was assured of winning broad support.
   Despite the diplomats' comments, a State Department official in
Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, insisted the U.S.
administration is firmly committed to repealing the resolution as
soon as possible. The official said there has been a continuing
worldwide diplomatic effort to mobilize support.
   Yuval Rotem, spokesman for the Israeli Mission, said Friday:
``We are going to continue our utmost efforts to repeal this.''

<HEAD>Martin Criticizes Simon's Reported Aid to Indebted Cooking School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican challenger Lynn Martin on Friday
called on Sen. Paul Simon to return any campaign contributions from
trade schools, following Simon's intervention on behalf of a
cooking school owing more than $150,000 in student loan refunds.
   The Illinois Democrat urged the Higher Education Assistance
Foundation to ease up on the Culinary Institute of Washington,
which at one time owed more than $500,000 to the foundation.
   Details of Simon's efforts were revealed during congressional
hearings in Washington on the guaranteed student loan program.
   The foundation is the nation's largest student loan guarantor
and is trying to stave off bankruptcy brought on by a heavy
portfolio of delinquent trade school loans.
   After Simon intervened on the school's behalf, school owner
Barkev Kibarian made two contributions worth $1,000 each to Simon's
re-election campaign. Simon spokesman David Carle said the
contributions were used for a fund-raiser for the senator last Nov.
8. Carle said he did not know how much was raised.
   Simon released a statement saying he was not pleased with his
staff's conduct in the case and would consider donating the money
Kibarian raised at the fund-raiser to the U.S. Treasury.
   Simon first wrote loan foundation Chairman Richard Hawk in March
1989, suggesting Hawk meet with Kibarian to discuss school problems
turned up in an audit. Five days later, a Simon aide wrote to the
school's consultant and agent, saying she had told another Simon
staff member of an ``offer to host a fund-raiser'' and said the
other staff member would be in touch, according to documents
released in the hearings.
   On Nov. 3, Simon wrote Hawk, urging him to consider
re-scheduling the school's payment so it would not exceed $7,000 a
month. Later that month, Hawk told Simon that he would lower the
payment from $20,000 a month to $15,000 but not go to $7,000.

<HEAD>Woman Who Killed on Videotape Gets Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose killing of a man was
videotaped received a death sentence despite her claims it was
either kill or be killed.
   Deidre Hunt, 21, said her manipulative boss forced her to
fatally gun down Mark Kevin Ramsey, 19, while the victim was tied
to a tree. The videotape viewed in court showed her fire three
shots, then grab Ramsey by the hair and deliver a final shot to the
temple.
   The condemned woman bowed her head and wept when Circuit Judge
S. James Foxman imposed the death penalty Thursday. The judge
called the killing ``cold, calculated and premeditated.''
   Hunt's former boss, Kosta Fotopoulos, 31, faces multiple murder
charges and was accused of videotaping Ramsey's killing.
   ``I was confronted with a decision that Kosta Fotopoulos had
absolutely already made,'' Hunt said Thursday. ``It was my decision
of living by shooting Mark Kevin Ramsey or dying with Mark Kevin
Ramsey. My decision was a choice to survive and I chose to live. ''
   Hunt had pleaded guilty to murder charges in the deaths of
Ramsey and Bryan Chase, 18. She also was sentenced to six life
prison terms for two counts of attempted murder, two counts of
solicitation to murder and one count each of conspiracy to murder
and armed burglary.
   Chase was killed after allegedly shooting Fotopoulos' wife,
Lisa. Hunt, allegedly at Fotopoulos' bidding, hired Chase to kill
Mrs. Fotopoulos so they could inherit her wealth along with
$700,000 in life insurance.
   Fotopoulos allegedly shot Chase after the 18-year-old broke into
the house Nov. 4 and shot Mrs. Fotopoulos in the head. Prosecutors
say he was shot to prevent exposure of the plot. Mrs. Fotopoulos
recovered from her wound.
   Hunt apologized to the victims' families Thursday and blamed
Fotopoulos.
   ``He's evil, vicious and a professional assassin who eliminates
human beings for a living and for his own personal gain,'' she
said. ``He didn't just eliminate others' lives, he eliminated minds
as well.''

<HEAD>Nicaraguan President Announces Reconcilation Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
announced Friday that national reconciliation talks will begin next
week.
   She said the negotiations, aimed at solving severe economic
problems and relieving heavy political stress in her 5-month-old
administration, will begin Thursday.
   ``The negotiators will be the workers, producers, business
operators and central government representatives,'' Mrs. Chamorro
said.
   Mrs. Chamorro appealed for participation by all parties. But it
was not clear if the leftist Sandinistas, the country's strongest
political force, would take part.
   In a statement Thursday, they said, ``Negotiation is a necessity
for everyone so that there will be lasting peace and stability in
Nicaragua, but the government has the main responsibility for
creating the minimum conditions for this effort to have the results
we all want.''
   Mrs. Chamorro spoke Friday to thousands of students gathered in
the central square of Managua, the capital, on the 134th
anniversary of Nicaraguan independence.
   Her conservative, U.S.-backed coalition was elected to replace
the Sandinista Front party administration of former president
Daniel Ortega.
   The advent of the new government brought an end to the
U.S.-funded war between the Contra rebels and the Sandinista
administration.
   However, Mrs. Chamorro's administration has been beset by
economic problems and political opposition.
   It has been forced to devalue the Nicaraguan currency 35 times.
It has also faced two crippling general strikes led by Sandinista
sympathizers.

   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter, in
style and substance early in his Senate confirmation hearings, is
proving what he had to: he's no Robert H. Bork.
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter, who spent many hours
watching videotapes of Bork's 1987 performance, is using his
appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee to distance
himself from the lingering memory of Bork's defeated high court
nomination.
   To many, Bork the Senate witness seemed a bloodless academic who
talked about the ``intellectual feast'' Supreme Court service would
provide. He sometimes bristled at pointed questions and ignored
some softballs pitched by sympathetic senators.
   In contrast, many of Souter's responses Thursday were
embellished with personal anecdotes. And he has won praise from two
committee members for being ``a listener.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - An appeals court lifted a ban on publication of
a book about Israel's secret service, reversing a judge's order to
halt distribution at the request of Israel. And the publisher says
sales will resume immediately.
   Israel's claim that the book endangers its intelligence agents
``has not been sufficiently supported,'' the Appellate Division of
New York Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday.
   On Wednesday, Judge Michael Dontzin had issued a temporary
restraining order barring publisher St. Martin's Press from
distributing the book, titled ``By Way of Deception: The Making and
Unmaking of a Mossad Officer.''
   The Israeli government filed a lawsuit claiming the book could
imperil agents of the agency called Mossad by blowing their cover.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Sharon Pratt Dixon is a political unknown, but
the woman who is favored to become the next mayor of the nation's
capital is hardly a political novice.
   The probable successor to Marion Barry, Dixon scored a stunning
victory Tuesday in the city's Democratic primary, her first bid for
public office.
   ``She didn't have the kind of money in the primary to put out
those television commercials, `This is Sharon Pratt Dixon, and this
is who I am,''' said Julius Hobson, a longtime observer of city
politics.
   ``But it would be a mistake to call her a political newcomer -
she doesn't have a real day-to-day record, but she does have a long
involvement in local and national politics,'' said Hobson.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - After 186 years of authoritarian
rule, mostly out of the barrel of a gun, democracy has again been
deferred on this impoverished Caribbean island.
   The postponement of elections has threatened to unravel the
caretaker civilian government of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
and raised new doubts about whether Haiti can succeed in its march
toward democracy.
   ``She cannot make good on her pledge to hold genuine elections,
so her administration has lost its reason to exist,'' said Gerard
Pierre-Charles, one of Haiti's most respected political analysts.
``We are sliding inexorably towards the temptation of a military
coup.''
   The independent Electoral Council, charged by the constitution
with organizing free and fair balloting, said last week it was
postponing the Nov. 4 elections until sometime in December for lack

   CHICAGO (AP) - Steven Balourdos was tired of the glitz along the
city's Magnificent Mile, so he did what he used to do back home in
Greece. He planted tomatoes. Some of his neighbors are less than
enthusiastic, but Balourdos says he's standing by his fruit.
   ``I feel very strongly to do what I do back home,'' Balourdos
said Thursday. He emigrated from a tomato-growing region in the
1950s and runs a business on Michigan Avenue.
   Earlier this summer, he planted about 30 tomato plants in square
granite containers on the sidewalk outside a high-rise where he
runs his second-story real estate development company. Only four
spindly plants remain. The rest have been ripped out by unknown
foes.
   Planters outside other buildings on the street contain exotic
flowers, neatly pruned trees and shrubs.

<HEAD>Parmer Holds Gramm's Washington Experience Against Him In Senate
Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Hugh Parmer is out to turn Sen. Phil
Gramm's Washington experience against him, depicting the GOP
senator as part of the problem on issues ranging from the budget to
the savings and loan mess.
   ``There is a general discontent with incumbents among voters,''
says Parmer, the campaign challenger who trails Gramm in both
public opinion polls and fund raising. ``I don't think the people
much like the results of what's gone on in Washington for the last
few years.''
   Parmer, a 51-year-old state senator who is a Fort Worth attorney
and the city's former mayor, maintains Gramm is a conservative
extremist who has lost touch with the values of Texans.
   ``Sen. Gramm's media campaign in which he basically identified
himself as one of the important movers and shakers in Washington in
recent years was a double-edged sword,'' Parmer said. ``It has
potential to damage him, given the hostility to the guys that are
in.
   ``They can't get the budget fixed. They can't get the savings
and loan problem fixed. They can't get the trade problem fixed.''
   But Parmer's approach runs the risk of drawing favorable
attention to Gramm's leadership role in Congress.
   While budget deficits have ballooned, Gramm's name is affixed to
the key law aimed at alleviating the problem, Gramm-Rudman. It
mandates spending cuts if deficit targets aren't met.
   Gramm, a 48-year-old former economics professor, said his role
in the national debate on issues such as the budget and trade
matters is what the voters expect from him.
   ``Texans expect the man who sits in Sam Houston's seat to be a
national leader,'' Gramm said in an interview. ``But they also
expct him to represent the state, to get things done for Texas,
and to come back home and listen to their views.''
   He touts his support for a strong military, research and high
technology programs and investments that advance the ``long-term
future of the country.''
   But Parmer says Gramm neglects programs for education, health
care and aid to the elderly.
   Gramm bolted from the Democratic Party in 1983, resigning his
U.S. House seat. He was re-elected to Congress within a month,
becoming the first Republican to represent the central Texas
district.
   Although widely disparaged by Texas' Democratic hierarchy, Gramm
is one of the state's most popular politicians and is heavily
favored for re-election.
   Gramm's campaign has raised nearly $14 million, more money than
any other U.S. senator seeking re-election. And he has kept a
blistering schedule of appearances, raising the GOP's profile in
traditionally Democratic Texas.
   He said he's not just looking to win re-election, but to win
with 60 percent of the vote, pulling in votes for other Republicans
further down the Texas ballot.
   Parmer, meanwhile, has raised more than $1.5 million, among the
highest totals of any Senate challenger, and is attacking on a wide
array of issues.
   Parmer's TV ads point out Gramm's opposition to federal funding
of abortions. The senator has sponsored five constitutional
amendments to ban abortion, but now supports the Texas GOP's
legislative plan that would allow pregnant women to obtain
abortions before the fetus is 20 weeks old.
   Parmer says the government should leave the abortion decision up
to women.
   Neither candidate is invulnerable on the savings and loan issue,
but both are pointing fingers.
   As a congressman in 1980, Gramm voted to raise deposit insurance
and remove geographical lending restrictions.
   Parmer was in the Texas Senate that deregulated state
institutions in a 1983 voice vote.
   Gramm accepted $86,098 from thrift-related interests during the
1980s, the sixth-highest total in the Senate and fourth-highest for
a member of the Senate Banking Committee, a study of campaign
contributions by Common Cause found.
   But Gramm says that ``90 cents out of every dollar of S&amp;L losses
were not in federally chartered S&amp;Ls but were in state-chartered
S&amp;Ls.''
   ``The great bulk of the problem was under his (Parmer's)
jurisdiction,'' Gramm said.

   Art lovers with a fertile imagination will have
a rich field to till as they stroll through sculptor Joel Shapiro's
exhibit at the Baltimore Museum of Art.
   Most of the 25 works are made of simple blocks of wood or
bronze, and suggest human or other figures in a wide array of
activity and emotion.
   His ability to create these impressions is what makes the
exhibit, ``Joel Shapiro - Tracing the Figure'' a success, said
Brenda Richardson, the museum's curator of painting and sculpture.
   ``Joel is more accessible. It's easier for us to get close to
his work,'' said Richardson, who collaborated with the artist in
designing the exhibit.
   The exhibit opened in August and runs through Oct. 7 at the
Baltimore Museum of Art, after which it will travel to the Des
Moines Art Center and the Center for Fine Arts in Miami.
   ``Very often when people see a minimalist exhibit, they feel
hostile, shut out. Many people feel very remote from it,''
Richardson said. ``That is not the response people have to
Shapiro.''
   Shapiro, 48, is a New York native who calls himself a
post-minimalist. Like the minimalists before him, he uses the most
basic of shapes, but unlike them, he goes beyond pure abstraction
and provides something more concrete to think about.
   ``I want the work to be loaded with emotion, loaded with
reference, but not to the point where it's gratuitous,'' he said
from his summer home and studio in Westport, N.Y.
   Therefore, Shapiro's sculptures have no faces, only the simplest
representations of body parts, and no titles. Still, they succeed
in conveying emotion - a tiny man kneeling in supplication; joyful
kicking dancers with flailing arms; a walking figure staring at the
ground apparently lost in thought.
   Some stimulate the imagination enough to bring several different
ideas to mind.
   At first glance, a series of painted wood blocks clearly suggest
a figure resting on its side with its left foot bent. In another
moment or from another angle, the figure disappears and the blocks
look more like a model of an apartment building.
   From one angle, a 7-foot-high bronze piece might suggest a giant
bird taking off. From another it could be a strutting drum major.
   ``He doesn't put into it either a bird or drum major. That's
precisely what he wants you to do,'' Richardson said. ``Even as you
may grasp a figure, you may lose that figure, especially as you
walk around it.''
   Shapiro says the images people glean from his sculptures are
often different from his own ideas in creating them.
   He accepts that as the price for displaying art in public.
   ``I'm open. I think I'm comfortable with people's response to
the work as long as they react to it and don't walk away.''
   Shapiro's roots offer little on the origins of his art. His
father was a doctor, his mother a biochemist.
   After college, he spent two years in the Peace Corps in the late
1960s. His experience in another culture helped him get a better
perspective on his own interests. ``I became an artist because
that's what I did best. I chose sculpture because it was very much
in the real world and not hanging on a wall.''
   Shapiro's work wasn't always as tangible is the work displayed
in the exhibit. Before the mid-'70s, he created more inanimate
objects, such as a tiny chair, tiny homes, coffins or ladders. They
implied the presence of the human form, through its absence.
   ``There was a point where I avoided using the figure,'' he said.
``Then there was a point where I just abandoned that limitation. I
felt that by using figuration . . . I could allow more into the
work. Also, it had to do with wanting the work to be more so you
would have an almost one-on-one experience with it.''

   Alan Gersman is a middle-aged, middle-class
white man who never dreamed he'd need the protections offered by
federal civil rights laws.
   But in 1988 he lost an important computer records storage
contract, and he believes it was because he is Jewish.
   Group Health Association stored software with Gersman's company
for four years and expressed consistent satisfaction with the
firm's services, court records say. But the contract was cancelled
shortly after an Egyptian employee, prompted by an Iranian
supervisor, asked Gersman if he were Jewish.
   ``It was the first time in my life when I could really identify
with a black person,'' said Gersman, 51, co-owner of Computer
Security International in suburban Washington. ``I'm really not
used to being discriminated against.''
   That was only the first shock. The next came when a federal
court threw out a lawsuit he filed against GHA. The primary reason:
a 1989 Supreme Court ruling that an important post-Civil War civil
rights statute, while it protected against bias in hiring, did not
cover on-the-job discrimination.
   Gersman said he found it hard to believe he had no recourse.
``That type of thing is so basic,'' he said. ``I don't know how you
could have liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' without it.
   Gersman, now appealing his case, is one of the human faces
behind the Civil Rights Act of 1990. The bill was passed by the
House and Senate and is headed toward an uncertain fate this fall
at the White House.
   The legislation is designed to reverse or supersede several
restrictive Supreme Court rulings on discrimination, including the
one that helped thwart Gersman's suit. The bill would also give
many more discrimination victims the right to sue for punitive and
compensatory damages; that route currently is open only to victims
of racial bias.
   Civil rights advocates have fought passionately for the bill and
at least one respected member of Congress - civil rights movement
veteran John Lewis of Georgia - says he won't campaign for anyone
who opposed it. But commercial interests and conservatives,
including President Bush, contend the bill could lead to quotas and
business-busting damage payments.
   Compromise has proven elusive through months of negotiations,
but a last-minute agreement is not out of the question. Bush would
much rather sign the bill than veto it and risk alienating the
minority groups he has been trying to court.
   While blacks come to mind as the most obvious beneficiaries of
stronger civil rights laws, they certainly would not be the only
ones. For it is incorrect to assume, as Gersman did, that ``people
have the option to do whatever they want to do... where they're
qualified to do the work. Nobody thinks twice about it.''
   Studies commissioned by an array of civil rights groups document
job environments that are utterly hostile to women, racial
minorities or certain religious groups. They also describe the many
holes, actual and prospective, that victims can fall through when
they try to obtain legal relief, along with writings by judges who
say their hands have been tied by the Supreme Court.
   Carol Zabkowicz of Racine, Wisc. was one victim. She endured
three years of sexual harassment so severe that her doctor ordered
a two-month medical leave during her second pregnancy in order to
ease stress-related gastrointestinal problems and avert a
miscarriage.
   ``There were verbal assaults from some male employees. They
called me a variety of names, they asked me to do sexual acts.
There were caricatures of myself posted around the warehouse -
either nude graffiti or myself engaged in sexual acts with animals
or human beings,'' Zabkowicz, 35, recalled of her employment at a
West Bend appliances distribution warehouse.
   A federal judge rejected the company's depiction of the problem
as a personality clash and said Zabkowicz had been the victim of
``sustained, malicious and brutal harassment'' that was
``malevolent and outrageous.'' He also said supervisors were well
aware of the harassment but did not stop it.
   The penalty for all of this amounted to a $2,763 check from West
Bend to Zabkowicz - back pay for her two-month medical leave. There
was no legal avenue to pursue damages for pain, suffering or
medical and psychiatric bills, leaving Zabkowicz with what she
considered a hollow victory.
   ``It just seems outrageous that in 1990 this stuff still goes
on,'' Zabkowicz said. ``Punitive and compensatory damages would be
a strong deterrent to make certain that this does not happen.''
   Gary Mason, a cooler repairman at a Coca-Cola bottling plant in
Lenexa, Kan., is black and therefore eligible to file for such
damages under current law. But he was unable to pursue them due to
the new Supreme Court restrictions on workplace protection.
   ``I was the first black repairman ever hired in the position I
had in the cooler department,'' recalled Mason, 35. ``Naturally I
started experiencing a lot of racial slurs and remarks and jokes. I
was denied promotions, reprimanded for things that I didn't do.
From day one, it was a bad atmosphere. The boss didn't even shake
my hand.''
   A federal judge said Coca-Cola officials ``apparentl said. Meanwhile,
according to
Mason, the harassment continues. ``I've been reprimanded for
serving on jury duty,'' he said.
   Both Mason and Zabkowicz say they would never have gone to court
if supervisors and company officials had responded to their
repeated complaints.
   ``These things occur on their premises and they turn their back
to it. That's when people are forced into the position to do
something about it,'' Zabkowicz said. ``Thank goodness we do have
these laws as an avenue to take. But to me, the laws aren't strong
enough.''

<HEAD>Not the Time to Cut Budget Deficits?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With members of Congress finally working hard to
achieve budget cuts, some of the very people who had urged them to
do so are having second thoughts.
   The very idea of cuts is so politically sensitive and
economically involved that some of these people speak only in
whispers. But what those whispers convey is that now might not be
the best time to cut anything but taxes.
   Events of the past several weeks have conspired to bring about
this newer attitude, events such as higher oil prices, additional
evidence of a decaying economy, a squeeze on household budgets and
a business credit crunch.
   The weakening economy now worries some of these people more than
continued budget overruns, in spite of their having made the latter
the biggest economic issue of the past year.
   The latest job figures have added to the concern. New job
creation has fallen abruptly. Unemployment is up, and monthly job
gains in private industry so far this year have been off nearly 50
percent from the like period of 1989.
   Other reports show that the only parts of the economy still
growing vibrantly are health care and state and local governments,
and each of these presents problems of its own: inflation in health
care and bureaucratic growth in government, neither of them
designed for a healthy economy.
   But, ask the whisperers, is now the time to make cuts in
government spending? Or even to hold it down? If the private sector
economy is withering, what except government spending is available
to give it a nudge?
   Besides, it is said, no matter what Congress or the White House
or anyone else wants, spending isn't likely to come down when
billions of dollars are being spent on the military action in the
Mideast.
   In a announcement called ``StraightTalk,'' Conference Board
economist Gail Fosler states that military and economic
uncertainties, combined with high tax burdens, ``will prevent any
meaningful action in slashing the deficit.''
   Fosler comments that ``federal borrowing will surge over the
next two years regardless of what the administration and Congress
do to bring down the deficit.''
   Those who say Congress shouldn't even try to make the effort
aren't declaring their positions nearly as boldly. To do so would
brand some of them as turncoats because all year long they have
been advocating cuts.
   But, says one analyst of the economic scene, ``as the
Gramm-Rudman deadline of Oct. 1 draws near, the weakening economy
threatens to make these budget negotiations an academic
excercise.''
   That comment comes from John Wright of Wright Investors'
Service, who adds that ``clearly, in its current fragile state, the
U.S. economy can scarcely tolerate either higher taxes or
across-the-board spending cuts.''
   But it can hardly afford higher interest rates either, and until
Congress reaches some sort of agreement those rates are likely to
remain high. That much has been indicated by Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
   Not only does he remain committed to smaller budget deficits,
but he seems equally determined to forestall any drop in interest
rates until Congress reaches an agreement.

   As one of the Senate's staunchest
conservatives for a dozen years, Orrin Hatch might be expected to
be among lawmakers campaigning to slash federal grants for the
arts.
   But the Utah Republican who spent two years as a Mormon
missionary is taking a pass.
   He shakes his head glumly at moves to curb funding for the
National Endowment for the Arts on grounds that some of the money
has gone to projects tainted by obscenity.
   ``No one is more against obscenity and pornography than I am,
but I just don't believe that the Congress should impose censorship
through the authorization process,'' Hatch said.
   ``Some of these people, if they had lived in the time of
Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, the Sistine Chapel would never
have been painted,'' Hatch says of lawmakers heading the drive.
``They wouldn't allow you to hang a Reubens in the Senate.''
   Hatch is scrupulously polite and soft-spoken, although sometimes
an emotional side surfaces unexpectedly.
   When the Senate debated rights for the disabled in July, Hatch
was telling how his brother-in-law suffered as a victim of polio.
Suddenly, he ``just broke down.''
   ``I mean I just wept, tears rolling down my cheeks,'' Hatch
recalls. ``I was embarrassed because I don't like people to know
that side of me that much.''
   From the scourge of the liberals to patron of the arts and other
issues irksome to conservatives, Hatch's political persona is
undergoing a distinct change.
   When Hatch arrived in the Senate in 1977, he was immediately
accepted as one of the fiercest conservatives to prowl the floor.
Over the last two years, though, he's been at odds with old allies
more than once.
   Despite conservative opposition, he spearheaded in 1989 a $1.75
billion-a-year package of child-care grants. He's campaigned for
escalation of the battle against AIDS. And he sponsored a Justice
Department program aimed at fighting ``hate crimes'' motivated by
racial and religious bias.
   The hate crimes bill put Hatch on a collision course with Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who called it ``the flagship of the gay rights
agenda.''
   Hatch, 56, scoffs at the notion that he's changed: He remains a
supporter of capital punishment, a critic of gun control and an
opponent of a major civil rights bill on Capitol Hill whose
minority-hiring provision, he says, would inevitably lead to hiring
quotas.
   All the same, a recent poll showed many Utah voters believe he's
moved in a more liberal direction.
   And he's finding increasing favor with lawmakers he once fought.
   ``He is open on some things,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. ``He
has grown, and I hope we can all grow. He was superb on the
hate-crimes bill.''
   Lean at 6-foot-4, with every silvery hair in place and a taste
for conservatively tailored dark suits and blazers, Hatch likes to
tell of his humble origins as the son of a Pittsburgh metal lather.
   ``I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks,'' he says. ``We
were poor, poor people.''
   He worked as a janitor to help pay his way through Brigham Young
University, where he met his wife, Elaine. They have three sons,
three daughters and 10 grandchildren.
   He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh Law School and
practiced in that city before returning to Utah.
   In 1976, he upset incumbent Democratic Sen. Frank Moss, in part
with the help of hundreds of Hatches in rural Utah, their numbers a
legacy of the heavily Mormon state's polygamous past.
   Moss and other Democrats, however, blamed rough-and-tumble
tactics by New Right conservatives - Washington groups whose
trademark was mail-order campaigns designed to rise funds and
energize voters around issues such as abortion and school prayer.
   In the Senate, Hatch is a vocal member of the Judiciary
Committee where he ranks second behind Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
But his major post is that of top Republican on the Labor
Committee, where he's often at odds with Chairman Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
   But frequently, Hatch and Kennedy reach a compromise, as they
did on a Hatch bill opposed by some liberals that allows export of
pharmaceuticals not yet approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use in this country.
   Indeed, the Hatch record on such matters gives business little
to complain about.
   He is a firm backer of bills to rein in court damages in product
liability and medical malpractice lawsuits - major goals of the
insurance industry. And he's sponsoring a bill to allow the federal
government to pre-empt tough state standards governing pesticides
in foods.
   Hatch scoffs at complaints from liberal consumer groups that his
bill would allow unsafe concentrations of pesticides in foods.
   ``That's not based on science,'' he says. ``That's based on old
wives' tales.''
   Senate Republicans take little notice of strained ties between
Hatch and conservative activists. They hail him as hard-working and
effective.
   ``I'm a real admirer of Orrin Hatch,'' said Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo.
   ``He undertakes the toughest chores in the Senate because he is
the ranking Republican on the Labor Committee,'' Danforth said.
``The issues he involves himself in are often hotly controversial
and take up a good deal of the Senate's time, but he does his job
with unflappable competence.''
   But such testimonials leave hard-core conservatives unmoved.
   ``He has separated himself from us ... on social welfare
legislation, on what we would call gay rights legislation, on a
whole range of issues,'' said New Right pioneer Paul Weyrich.
   Weyrich says Hatch has been shopping for issues to help broaden
his support and hopes for an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Indeed, when Justice William Brennan announced his retirement,
reporters were quick to corner Hatch and ask if he wanted the post.
He said no.
   Hatch also says he's always been a champion of the underdog and
that perhaps his conservative critics just haven't noticed.
   ``I have always been an advocate of those with disabilities,
those who are downtrodden, who really can't help themselves,'' he
said. ``What I have a problem with is people who can help
themselves but won't.''
   At the same time, he says his conservative critics should take a
more careful look at his overall record.
   ``I wonder who they think took the lead in fighting for a lot of
the changes around here,'' he said, his voice rising. ``I wonder
who they think fought for fairness in the Iran-Contra hearings.''
   That view is echoed by writer-activist Patrick McGuigan, author
of a recent book on the battle over Robert Bork's nomination to the
Supreme Court. McGuigan is an outspoken Hatch admirer, but says
many would disagree.
   ``There are a lot of conservatives who don't know him as well as
I do who think Orrin Hatch has gone around the bend,'' says
McGuigan. ``They think he isn't a conservative anymore.''

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like many other machines that make the economy
go, the stock market seems to be running on oil these days.
   More often than not in recent trading on Wall Street,
fluctuations in stock prices have looked like a virtual mirror
image of the ups and downs of the oil market.
   Example: Last Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial average rose
about 30 points in early trading as oil prices fell. The Dow's
gains abruptly vanished, leaving the average with a 4-point loss
for the day, immediately following an afternoon upsurge in oil
prices.
   There is no mystery about the connection investors have been
making between the two markets.
   When the price of oil doubles, as it did this summer from about
$15 a barrel to $30-plus, it naturally tends to scramble the
economic outlook in the United States and other energy-importing
countries.
   Analysts' earnings estimates have had to be recalculated from
scratch, not just in the energy business but in a broad range of
other industries, ranging from the airlines and automakers to
chemical manufacturing and electric utilities.
   With all that, however, a casual onlooker might still wonder how
the fortunes of stocks in general might become so closely linked to
what is happening in the market for a single commodity.
   Those who see a method in this mania say oil prices carry a
special impact in part because of the precarious state of the
economy that prevailed before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   They view higher fuel costs as the functional equivalent of a
tax increase, draining off large amounts of disposable income at a
time when the economy was already running low on supplies of money
and credit.
   ``Prior to the oil shock, we were forecasting a full-scale but
moderate recession,'' said Richard Hoey, chief U.S. economist at
the investment banking firm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc. in New
York.
   ``In our view, the oil price shock has not precipitated a
recession, but rather is likely to make the U.S. recession which
had already begun more severe.''
   As analysts attempt to determine the potential extent of such an
economic slump, each swing up or down in the oil price yields a new
result from the equation.
   At the same time, however, a good many observers believe the
recent fixation on oil prices has gone to extremes that are typical
of market psychology.
   Some analysts say the focus on oil provides a handy ``cover
story'' while the market adjusts to a business slump that would
have happened in any event.
   ``It is widely believed that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
significantly altered the world outlook for peace and prosperity,''
observed David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International Inc.
   ``However, the early data for August show no abrupt change in
behavior. Unfortunately, the data do show that the pre-crisis
pattern of steady decline in activity continued in August.''
   Still other market watchers suggest that oil news has kept many
people from paying as much heed as they might to other developments
of lasting import.
   ``In the country's fixation on the Persian Gulf, it is easy to
miss or ignore many other significant developments,'' said Raymond
F. DeVoe Jr. at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
   Among these, he says, one holds the promise of being ``the story
of the decade, or even of the postwar period'' - the political and
economic upheaval in the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet Union no longer exists, either as a coherent nation
or economy,'' DeVoe asserts. ``This stunning fact will dominate
world affairs for decades to come after the resolution of the
Persian Gulf crisis.''

<HEAD>ABSTRACT GLASNOST: Exhibit of Great Russian Painter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Russia's great abstract painters of the
20th century, out of favor when ``Socialist realism'' was the only
art for the Soviets, gets his biggest exhibit here on Sunday 55
years after his death.
   Kazimir Severinovich Malevich (pronounced mal-YAY-vitch) never
went to prison, as far as anyone can ascertain today. However, the
director of the Kiev Art Gallery was given a long sentence for
mounting a show of his work.
   Malevich himself was arrested in 1930 after a trip to the West
and questioned about ideologies, deviations and right and left
tendencies. His friends burned some of his voluminous writings,
just in case.
   ``He was one of the greatest and most original spokesman of the
entire Russian avant-garde,'' Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev wrote
in the current catalog for the exhibit ``Kazimir Malevich,
1878-1935.'' Raisa Gorbachev added a tribute of her own.
   And President Bush, in a letter welcoming the exhibit, wrote:
   ``The creative forms of Kazimir Malevich may be as complex and
varied as the range of human emotions, yet they unite us in our
appreciation for his talent and vision.''
   Work of these avant-garde artists for decades was confined to
the cellars of Soviet museums. Under Gorbachev's policies of
openness and reconstruction, the Soviets brought out Malevich's
work for a show in 1988.
   Armand Hammer, the American industrialist who has known Soviet
leaders since Lenin, helped get the pictures for the National
Gallery of Art.
   ``The Russians rarely say `nyet' to Hammer,'' explained J.
Carter Brown, director the National Gallery.
   After the exhibition closes at the National Gallery on Nov. 4,
it will go to Los Angeles as the inaugural show at the Armand
Hammer Museum and Cultural Center.
   Malevich, the son of a sugar mill manager, produced his first
finished painting in 1889, when he was 11. In the early years of
the century, he learned in Moscow about the works of the great
French Impressionists and post-Impressionists of the period. He
painted in versions of west European styles, but always with a
distinctive Russian flavor.
   Some of his works resemble the paintings of Fernand Leger, Piet
Mondrian and even the distinctive stylings of Paul Cezanne.
Malevich gradually moved away from pictures of recognizable people
and objects.
   World War I was a time of radical art movements in Russia, each
with a fanciful name. Though he was asked not to antagonize the
public by introducing still another name, Malevich called his own
theory ``Suprematism.''
   A key painting, which has led to most comment over the years,
was simply a black square. Analysts claim to see many things under
the unrelieved blackness. Visitors who prefer less abstract art may
get more from his earlier and later work.
   ``Today we have advanced into a new fourth dimension of
motion,'' Malevich wrote. ``We have pulled up our consciousness by
its roots from the Earth. It is now free to revolve in the infinity
of space.''
   Angelica Zander Rudenstine, curator of the exhibit, says that by
``Suprematism'' he meant a higher kind of painting than the
representation of familiar objects.
   Malevich joined enthusiastically in the revolutionary movements
of 1917. In the first days of the Soviet government it appointed
him Commissar for the Preservation of Monuments and Antiquities,
especially those in the Kremlin. But when he visited the West in
1929 with paintings for a show in Berlin, he took the precaution of
leaving them behind.
   Many were acquired later by the Stadelijk Museum in Amsterdam
and brought to Washington for the current show.
   Toward the end of his life, Malevich returned to painting
recognizable figures. But they were flat and unrealistic, not
Socialist realism at all. Some he did in a much earlier style, and
put earlier dates on them. His last works were realistic portraits,
including a self-portrait in which he wore clothes of the Italian
Renaissance.
   The exhibit will be at the Armand Hammer Museum and Cultural
Center in Los Angeles from Nov. 25 to Jan. 13. From Feb. 7 through
March 24, it will show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York.

<HEAD>One Year on, South Carolina Healing but Scars from Hugo Linger</HEAD>

   One year after Hurricane Hugo smashed
ashore, Charleston still bears the scars from the most destructive
hurricane ever to hit the U.S. mainland.
   Shingles are missing from the tattered roof of St. Michael's
Episcopal Church, the oldest in the city, and the spire at the top
of the bell tower has yet to be replaced.
   The nearby Charleston County Courthouse stands empty, its roof
destroyed. Masking tape still lines its windows, preparation for
the storm that thundered ashore a year ago this week.
   But across Meeting Street, City Hall bustles with the business
of government, just as it did that lightless night last Sept. 21
when Hugo crashed into South Carolina, packing winds of 135 mph.
   Hugo's wrath claimed 29 lives on the U.S. mainland and was felt
across hundreds of miles, from fishing communities on the South
Carolina coast to mill towns nestled in the North Carolina
mountains. The storm caused an estimated $5.9 billion damage.
   A year later, the recovery - both physical and emotional -
continues. But for a relatively small, poor state, a lot has been
done in the past 12 months to put things back in order.
   ``It's a miracle we're back where we are, given the enormity of
the storm that hit us and the fact that over half our state was
declared a disaster area,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said.
   He noted that the beaches have been repaired and the tourism
industry has rebounded.
   The historic district, the heart of Charleston's tourist
economy, was scrubbed up in quick order. Indeed, visitors would
have trouble telling Charleston took the brunt of such a severe
storm.
   ``The recovery has been phenomenal,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley
Jr. ``It is almost a miracle. It's a tribute to the citizens of the
community. They didn't cry or whine or get angry. Everybody got to
work and pitched in.''
   During the past year, the city opened a waterfront park, and a
new visitor's center is nearing completion.
   ``The city has not only recovered, this was not a year we
treaded water,'' Riley said.
   But the recovery among the rural poor has taken longer. The
sound of hammers and the buzz of power saws still can be heard on
the hard-hit barrier islands northeast of town.
   Following Hugo, hundreds of tons of supplies and about $3.7
million in donations flooded into Charleston. Last month, the final
$1 million was distributed to relief agencies.
   Richard Hendry of the Trident Community Foundation said more
could have been used. There was not near enough to meet requests,
which totaled almost $8 million, he said.
   ``The needs are still being uncovered,'' Hendry said.
   In rural Berkeley County, about 150 people wait to have homes
repaired or rebuilt, said Henry Bonner, executive director of
Berkeley County Interfaith Disaster Ministries.
   ``No matter how much publicity we've had since the storm, it's
surprising how many people hear about us by word-of-mouth for the
first time,'' Bonner said.
   The donations of money and building supplies that followed the
storm have tapered off. Now, most of the help comes from South
Carolinians.
   ``We're finding since the emergency a lot of people have been
able to get friends and relatives to help in the repairs,'' Bonner
added. ``Last winter, people were struggling to get over the storm.
They couldn't help each other.''
   Hugo brought a building boom to the sea islands.
   Vacant lots remain in places where weathered bungalows once
lined the beach. Much of the debris has been cleared, and new
houses are going up.
   But a block from the ocean on Sullivans Island, weeds sprout
through the floorboards of a rusted red sports car. The car sits in
front of a shattered house next to the battered hulk of a pickup
truck.
   Next door, a crew of about 20 workers labors in the hot sun on a
new beach house with an ocean view.
   To the north, in the small shrimping hamlet of McClellanville,
streets have been cleared of debris. The local shrimp fleet is
again plying the Atlantic. But the rotting hulls of two shrimp
boats tossed ashore by Hugo still bear mute witness to the storm's
fury.
   It was a boom year for construction, with thousands of workers
flooding the area. Officials estimate about $3 billion was pumped
into the Charleston area economy for construction services and
trade.
   Many of the physical scars have healed, but the emotional toll
is more difficult to assess.
   The Hugo Outreach program sponsored by the state Department of
Mental Health counseled more than 26,000 people during the past
year.
   During recent weeks, an increase has been noted in requests for
help, said Cathy Joyner, a counselor with the program.
   ``We're seeing a lot of people who have not physically
recovered, and they realize they are frightened and anxious,'' she
said. ``An anniversary is an opportunity to go back and re-evaluate
where they were a year ago and see if they have made any progress.
It will be frightening for a lot of people to see they are not
where they want to be.''
   Since Hugo, there have been increases in domestic abuse reports,
people seeking help with drinking problems and divorce filings.
   Counselors say 20,000 South Carolinians could suffer long-term
psychological problems. Officials hope the outreach program, which
includes 50 counselors statewide, can be extended through spring.
   Local governments will mark the storm anniversary with a
candlelight observance at City Hall. Several commercial events also
will note the occasion, including a road race and a golf
exposition.
   For some, it will be a trying time.
   Lynn Ziegler heads the building committee for the Sunrise
Presbyterian Church on Sullivans Island.
   The church was destroyed in the storm, and the congregation has
met in a tent since last January. A new building won't be in place
until next year.
   Mrs. Ziegler's house on the Isle of Palms was not severely
damaged, and she said she suffered from survivor's guilt.
   ``I had been praying for some way to help,'' said Mrs. Ziegler,
who worked in relief efforts after the storm. When asked to chair
the building committee, ``I felt I was unqualified.
   ``But then I saw this was the answer to my prayers,'' she said.

   As the expiration of the contract between the
United Auto Workers and General Motors Corp. neared, negotiators
for the two sides were keeping mum.
   The three-year national pact covering 300,000 workers is to
expire at midnight Friday. If GM and the UAW neither reaches an
agreement nor extendes the current contract, the union could call a
strike.
   Meanwhile, more than 85 percent of the local issues between the
union and GM remained unresolved Thursday, awaiting a final
agreement on a national contract. GM and UAW leaders said the slow
pace of loca agreements was not unusual.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Energy Secretary James Watkins said he sees no
sign of price-gouging by the oil industry and characterized the
surge in gasoline prices as ``not unreasonable'' considering crude
oil market conditions.
   Watkins was asked repeatedly about gasoline costs at a hearing
Thursday of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Oil
prices have risen dramatically since Iraq occupied Kuwait, and some
consumer groups and politicians have raised allegations of
price-gouging.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., told Watkins that ``there will be a
tremendous outrage if we see a surge in profits for the oil
companies'' when they next release quarterly financial statements.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Prosecutors filed a sentencing report about
financier Michael Milken that is believed to allege numerous
uncharged crimes, but it was not immediately made public even
though the news media wants access.
   An attorney for Milken said he would oppose release of the
papers, filed Thursday, before the former Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. junk bond executive is sentenced on Oct. 1 for his guilty plea
to six securities and tax fraud counts.
   The sentencing memorandum reportedly contains details about
Milken's alleged conduct unearthed by the government but never made
public because of the plea agreement reached in April.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Scandinavian Airlines System completed a $50
million deal that makes it the largest shareholder of Continental
Airlines Holdings Inc. and puts Frank Lorenzo out as Continental
chairman.
   Lorenzo will get $30 million through the arrangement, which was
finalized Thursday after being approved a day earlier by the
Transportation Department, but a Continental spokesman said the
money is not all coming from the SAS purchase.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Failure to reach a budget agreement could
reduce domestic airline flights by up to 30 percent and cause chaos
at major airports, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration
said.
   ``If it's required, we would be furloughing up to two days per
person per pay period,'' Administrator James B. Busey told
reporters Thursday. ``That's the worst case.''
   That would cause roughly a 25 percent reduction in FAA's work
force on any given day, including its force of 17,200 air traffic
controllers, Busey said.
   ---
   WASHINGTON - A company stuck with four multimillion-dollar
furnaces that the Bush administration first approved and then
disapproved for shipment to Iraq filed a $62 million lawsuit
against Saddam Hussein's government.
   The federal court suit filed Thursday by Consarc Corp., of
Rancocas, N.J., claims that Saddam's invasion of Kuwait and Iraqi
deception over how the high-temperature furnaces would be used
resulted in losses for the industrial furnace builder and its
sister company in Scotland.

   NEW YORK (AP) - CBS and the Tokyo Broadcasting System will
combine resources and technology for worldwide newsgathering, and
study the possibility of co-producing sports and entertainment
programming.
   CBS News said Thursday that the agreement, to go into effect in
April, will be the first of its kind between a U.S. network and one
in Japan. It will create ``the world's largest satellite
newsgathering system,'' CBS said.

   BOSTON (AP) - The quality of U.S. manufactured goods is on the
rise, according to a Boston University study on manufacturing
competitiveness based on a survey of company executives.
   The good news for manufacturers is that the improvement rate on
the quality of goods has increased in the last two years. But the
report also found new product development and cost as possile
trouble spots on the U.S. manufacturing front.

   PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) - The New Kids on the Block are doing
almost as well in plastic as they are in vinyl.
   A million of the 12\-inch fashion dolls have been sold since
they were introduced a month ago, Wayne Charness, a spokesman for
toymaker Hasbro Inc., said Thursday. That's platinum.
   By comparison, the pop group's latest album, In Step, went
triple platinum last month, two months after it was released, said
an official with the Record Industry Association of America.

   The stock market fell sharply Thursday in light but steady
selling attributed to fears of impending bad news on the economy.
The Dow Jones average tumbled 43.07 points to 2,582.67, its biggest
one-day drop since falling 76.73 points Aug. 23.
   The dollar sank against all its major foreign counterparts. Gold
posted moderate gains.
   Corn and wheat futures prices fell, as did soybeans. Crude oil
futures rose slightly. Precious metals were mixed. Cattle were
mixed. Pork futures retreated.
   Treasury bonds were mixed.

   The New Kids on the Block are doing
almost as well in plastic as they are in vinyl.
   A million of the 12\-inch fashion dolls have been sold since
they were introduced a month ago, Wayne Charness, a spokesman for
toymaker Hasbro Inc., said Thursday.
   That's platinum.
   By comparison, the pop group's latest album, In Step, went
triple platinum last month, two months after it was released, said
an official with the Record Industry Association of America, who
asked that her name not be used.
   While not quite as popular as the records, ``retailers cannot
keep their store shelves stocked'' with the dolls, Charness said.
   ``We expect whatever we get for the remainder of the year will
sell out,'' said Stephen J. Sanberg, a wholesale toy distributor
for H. Sanberg and Son-Sanco Toy of Foxboro, Mass. ``It's a
pleasant surprise in a relatively flat toy year.''
   ``It's selling well now and we expect it to continue doing well
through Christmas,'' said Angela Bourdon, spokeswoman for the Toys
'R Us Inc. chain.
   For Hasbro, which had slow sales this year, the doll's
popularity is good news. Sluggish sales in the second-quarter cut
the company's profits to $8.7 million, down nearly 52 percent from
the same period a year ago.
   Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive, said at the
time that he still expected a year-end result similar to 1989,
based on anticipated sales of the New Kids dolls and others
resembling members of the World Wrestling Federation.
   Hasbro, whose line also includes traditional favorites such as
G.I. Joe and Mr. Potato Head, had net sales of about $1.41 billion
last year.
   ``We are extremely pleased by (the New Kids dolls') first-month
performance,'' Charness said. ``Early indications are that we have
a real hit on our hands.''
   There are two styles of New Kids dolls, one in concert clothes
that comes with a tape and retails for about $18, and one in street
clothes that sells for about $15.
   Charness said dolls usually attract girls aged 4 to 10, but the
New Kids also have been selling to young teen-agers up to age 15.
   ``The older girls are using them as a kind of three-dimensional
poster,'' he said.
   It's been five years since a major toy company made a doll based
on a pop group. A Michael Jackson doll, launched by LJN Toys Ltd.
of New York, was on the market for less than a year, but did
``exceptionally well for a short period of time,'' a spokesman
said.
   Other New Kids products marketed by various companies include a
book, beach towels, watches, T-shirts, lunch boxes and a TV cartoon
show.
   Charness said there are plans at Hasbro for New Kids in 1991
``that we think will extend the longevity of the doll,'' but he
would not identify the plans.
   An unidentified toy industry source told The Providence
Journal-Bulletin that a soft, stuffed New Kids doll will be
introduced next year.

   Local union bargainers with contracts of their
own to negotiate are closely watching progress in national talks
between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors Corp. as
tonight's contract expirations draw near.
   As of Thursday, tentative agreements still hadn't been reached
in about 85 percent of more than 100 GM-UAW local contracts. A GM
official, who declined to be identified, said company executives
were satisfied with that level and that such a pace was normal.
   Local contracts, like the national GM-UAW agreement, expire at
midnight.
   Main issues facing national negotiators include job security and
wage increases. Issues in local talks var widely from plant to
plant, including matters such as location of break areas,
availability of emergency health care and plant safety. Larger
economic and non-economic issues affecting all auto workers are
reserved for the national contract.
   There are 155 GM facilities with UAW-represented employees, the
vast majority of which are parts plants. Fourteen of the locals
have ``living agreements'' with no expiration dates.
   Seventeen UAW locals had reached tentative local agreements by
Thursday, the company official said. The remaining 124 locals have
yet to reach agreements.
   Leaders of some union locals may have taken the advice of UAW
Vice President Stephen Yokich, who said last week that it may be a
good idea to keep at least one local issue open as national
negotiations neared the deadline.
   ``We're meeting every day and things are moving along, but a lot
of bearing has to do with national negotiations and progress
there,'' said Dave Kimmel, president of UAW Local 1714 at GM's
metal stamping plant in Lordstown, Ohio. ``When that gets through,
then the process locally will speed up.''
   Bargainers for GM and UAW Local 276 at the automaker's car
assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, reached a local agreement last
month, well ahead of the deadline, said local President Dave
Perdue.
   Four years ago, the local renegotiated its contract with GM so
there wasn't too much work to do this time, he said. ``It was a
fine-tuning sort of thing,'' Perdue said.
   Labor relations at parts and component plants have become
increasingly important as the huge automaker relies more on the
``just-in-time'' parts system, which delivers components to
assembly plants sometimes just a few hours before they're needed on
assembly lines.
   Because of that, a walkout at a parts plant over a local issue
can quickly stop assembly plant production. If such a strike were
prolonged, idling assembly plants, other parts plants could be
affected.
   GM learned the potential effects of such a strike last month
when UAW Local 659 in Flint struck a fuel-tank factory for six
days. By the time the dust settled, seven assembly plants had shut
down and portions of more than a dozen other parts plants were
idled.
   Wall Street analysts have speculated the strike by about 2,800
Local 659 members will create a $50 million dent in GM's
third-quarter earnings because of lost assembly plant production.

   Light-truck sales lagged as Middle East tensions
boosted gas prices, but a rise in car purchases brought overall
sales of North American-made vehicles up 2.4 percent in early
September.
   The 10 major companies making cars in the United States said
average daily sales crept up to 31,065 in the Sept. 1-10 period
from an average of 30,333 a day in early September 1989.
   Car sales rose 6.7 percent while truck sales dropped 4.6 percent
for the period.
   Car sales by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. were virtually flat, edging up just 0.8 percent, while sales
of cars made by Japanese companies in North America jumped 81.9
percent.
   A 6.8-percent slide in light-truck sales overwhelmed the
car-sales increase for an overall 2.2 percent decline for the Big
Three in the 10-day period.
   Rising gas prices were just one concern of consumers, who also
worried about the economy in general and their jobs, GM spokesman
Terry Sullivan said.
   But automotive analyst Maryann Keller of Furman Selz Mager Dietz
&amp; Birney in New York blamed the dent in truck sales on gas price
increases after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``These are the gas guzzlers of this decade,'' Keller said.
``Gasoline is suddenly more expensive and they look at a truck and
they see a healthy 14 miles a gallon, and they say `There might be
a place where I might spend my money more efficiently.'''
   For the year through Sept. 10, North American-made cars and
light trucks sold at a rate of 36,460 a day, down 4.5 percent from
a 38,194-a-day average through Sept. 10 last year.
   Car sales were down 5.6 percent and light truck sales were down
2.8 percent for the year.
   Chrysler said its combined early September car and truck sales
dropped 16.4 percent from the year before, with car sales down 15.9
percent and light truck sales - including popular minivan models -
17 percent behind last year's.
   Chrysler reported overall vehicle sales for the year down 15
percent.
   Ford said its early September sales of cars and trucks ran 3.7
percent ahead of last year's pace, with a 10.2-percent gain in
truck sales overcoming a 0.6 drop in car sales. For the year, Ford
said its car and truck sales were down 9 percent.
   GM said its early September truck sales lagged 13.8 percent
while car sales rose 6.4 percent, for an overall 1.1-percent drop
in vehicle sales for the period. For the year, GM car and truck
sales were down 4.6 percent from last year.

   Capitol Hill staffers say a suggested tax on
securities transactions appears to be foundering, but opponents are
still mounting a massive lobbying effort just in case.
   ``I think rumors of the demise of it are probably premature, but
I haven't heard any great clamoring out there for it. I have not
talked to anyone who thinks its a good idea, but it's not dead,'' a
lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Thursday.
   However, several congressional staffers - who did not want to be
identified during the sensitive budget negotiations - said the
tax's chances look weak, at best.
   ``The transaction tax is, I think, dead,'' said a House staffer
familiar with the budget discussions. ``If there's any life to it,
it's wheezing on the floor.''
   ``The last I heard, it was not dead but it seemed to be
reeling,'' said a staffer on another House committee.
   Securities firms have run newspaper ads against a rumored
transaction tax on the sale of stocks, bonds, futures contracts and
other financial products. Opponents say the tax would hurt
everyone, not just Wall Street, because the tax would eventually be
passed on to customers and make it harder for companies and local
governments to raise money through bonds and other securities.
   There have been published reports since July that the Bush
administration was considering a stock trading excise tax between
.15 percent and .5 percent as a means of closing the budget gap.
   Officials believe that the deficit will likely exceed $250
billion - a record - in the upcoming fiscal year unless something
is done. Without a budget agreement by Oct. 1, the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law will shrink the $1.2 trillion budget by $100
billion, an amount that would disrupt most federal programs and
agencies.
   But since securities and futures exchanges, pension and mutual
fund groups and local politicians in New York and Chicago rose up
to oppose the proposed securities tax, little has been heard about
it around Congress.
   ``In broad terms, I've heard no mention of that kind of tax
being proposed by anyone in these discussions,'' said a Senate aide
close to the negotiations who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a broadly based
.5 percent tax on all securities except Treasury securities would
raise about $12 billion a year to start.
   But opponents say those numbers will never be reached because
the tax would make trading more expensive, driving business
overseas and leaving fewer transactions to tax.
   They also say the increased costs to high volume traders like
insurance companies and pension funds would be passed on to
customers, pensioners or - in the case of public employee pension
funds - taxpayers.
   Even the Congressional Research Service, in a report issued in
July, noted that a half penny tax on transactions could cut trading
volume in the stock market by 7.9 percent and reduce stock market
prices by as much as 7.7 percent.
   Numerous groups spearheded by the Securities Industry
Association and the Public Securities Association have written
Congress and the White House arguing against a securities tax.
   New York City officials have also been vocal in their opposition
to the tax, saying it would hurt the city's securities industry and
the local economy.

   Watch out, fat cats. Pet food manufacturers
are competing for the right to reduce your ranks.
   And the new battleground is the supermarket, rather than
specialty pet stores.
   Starting this month, Heinz Pet Products Co. is distributing a
diet cat food to grocery stores nationwide. The company says Lean
Entrees, its new 9-Lives product, is the first national line of 95
percent fat-free canned cat food.
   The company, a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co., is
hoping for greater sales in the supermarkets than it could achieve
in specialty stores, and is targeting owners who fear their felines
are putting on pounds.
   ``We've got our fingers crossed,'' said Ed Johnson, general
manager of cat food marketing for Heinz Pet Products, which moved
its headquarters last year to this northern Kentucky city from Long
Beach, Calif.
   It may be a while before results are clear. Diet pet food is too
new to have made any measurable market impact, said William Leach,
an industry analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities
Corp.
   ``Diet pet food just seems kind of ridiculous to me,'' he added.
``There are so many people starving in the world, and pet owners
are worried about their pets getting fat.''
   The entry of reduced-fat, reduced-calorie products into the cat
food market is a carryover from the human interest in those
concerns, said Patrick Farrell, a spokesman for Ralston Purina Co.
of St. Louis.
   His company came out several months ago with Cat Chow Mature, a
reduced-fat, reduced-calorie, dry cat food sold in supermarkets.
It's marketed for older, more sedentary cats.
   ``It's an area that's become popular recently. More and more
consumers are taking an interest, and you're seeing more products
coming out in response to that,'' he said.
   ``The big thing right now in consumer human food is fat,
low-fat. I think that trend is carrying forward into pet food,''
Johnson said.
   Fat cats are a growing problem. Heinz estimates that 20 percent
of the nation's cats are overweight. Like obese humans, they have a
greater risk of heart ailments or other fatal maladies.
   Heinz says ``health and fitness'' pet foods have been sold
mostly in specialty pet stores and veterinary clinics. Those
businesses account for about 20 percent of the $5.9 billion U.S.
market for cat and dog food, says Heinz, which produces cat and dog
food.
   Lean Entrees results from a year of development, Johnson said.
He declined to reveal what the company's sales projections are or
how much it cost to develop the product. Nationwide television
advertisements promoting the product will begin next month.
   Competitors also are trying to claw their way into the market.
   Ralston Purina has its Cat Chow Mature. For the past three
years, it's also sold Pro Plan cat food, a line of products
including a ``light formula'' intended for aging fat cats.
   ``We don't discuss sales figures, but it's meeting our
expectations,'' Farrell said.
   Lean Entrees features five popular flavors from the 9-Lives
line: liver and beef, beef and seafood, chicken and seafood stew,
chicken and liver entree, and ocean fish and shrimp stew. A can
will cost 39 cents, a few pennies more than 9-Lives' regular
variety.

   Gasoline prices have jumped an average 20
percent in the six weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait, but Energy
Secretary James Watkins calls the rise ``not unreasonable'' and
discounts suggestions that oil companies are gouging consumers.
   Watkins was asked repeatedly about gasoline costs during a
Thursday hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., told Watkins the public is awaiting
release of quarterly statistics on oil company profits and
predicted ``there will be a tremendous outrage if we see a surge in
profits.''
   The secretary said his department would keep an eye on the
profit reports. But he spoke out against legislation, introduced
earlier in the week, that would prohibit ``unreasonable'' price
increases for petroleum products. He said such a law would amount
to price control and require a ``massive bureaucracy'' to ensure
adequate monitoring.
   Since Iraq overran Kuwait Aug. 2, gasoline prices have risen
about 20 percent at the pump while crude oil prices have jumped
about 55 percent, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
   Watkins acknowledged that initial increases at the pump were
greater than the early rises in oil prices. However, he said,
retail increases in recent weeks have ``lagged about 4 cents a
gallon'' behind hikes on the spot crude oil market.
   Americans on average are paying 22 cents a gallon more for
unleaded gasoline today than before Aug. 2, while the spot price
for crude is 26 cents a gallon higher, according to government and
industry officials.
   Watkins told the Senate panel that the pricing of gasoline ``is
working very well and is rather typical of the supply and demand
situation.'' The secretary said he considered the recent price
hikes ``not unreasonable.''
   A group of senators said Wednesday they would try to push
through in the coming weeks legislation that would strengthen
federal laws against price gouging by oil companies.
   ``The laws of gravity and economics clearly don't seem to apply
to gas prices. What goes up stays up,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn. ``They charge what they can get away with.''
   The bill sponsored by Lieberman and other senators would
prohibit ``unreasonable'' price increases in petroleum products,
including gasoline and heating oil, and would make ``profiteering''
a criminal offense punishable by a maximum five-year jail sentence
and $500,000 fine.
   Watkins said his department would watch for ``unscrupulous''
business people taking advantage of oil shortages but said he
didn't want to ``assume that everyone in America is a crook.''

   Retail prices in Britain were up 10.6 percent in
August compared to levels a year earlier, the highest rate of
inflation since 1982, the government reported Friday.
   Higher prices for gasoline, heating oil, food and beer pushed
the index up 1.0 percent between July and August, the Central
Statistical Office said.
   The last time inflation was in double figures was in March 1982
when the rate was 10.4 percent.
   Excluding mortgages and local taxes, the rate of increase was
7.9 percent in August, up from 7.0 percent in July, the government

   A federal bankruptcy court judge has approved
the $650 million takeover of Allegheny International Inc. by the
New York investment firm Japonica Partners.
   Judge Joseph Cosetti gave his assent Thursday at a hearing after
the appliance maker reported the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had
authorized the transfer of a radioactive waste dump to the
partnership. The NRC approval was one of the last steps necessary
before the court could approve the acquisition.
   Allegheny International, which makes Sunbeam and Oster products,
said the change in control will take place during the week of Sept.
24. When the takeover becomes effective, the company will emerge
from federal bankruptcy protection after 2{ years.
   The radioactive site is in Newburgh Heights, Ohio. It was used
by a former Allegheny International subsidiary as a waste dump.

<TEXT>
   A $100 million joint venture between Walt
Disney Studios and a Japanese-backed company to produce motion
pictures was created in response to complaints of foreign
investment in Hollywood.
   The four-year deal announced Thursday calls for Disney and
Interscope Communications to contribute equal sums of no less than
$50 million each to a production and marketing fund.
   The effort should yield about seven pictures, said Robert Cort,
Interscope's chairman and president.
   Interscope's contributions will be funded by Nomura Babcock &amp;
Brown, the giant U.S.-Japanese investment enterprise. Founded in
March 1988, Nomura was founded by Nomura Securities Co., Japan's
largest securities firm, and Babcock &amp; Brown, a San Francisco-based
investment banker.
   Nomura will sell partnership interests to its customers in Japan
in order to provide all of Interscope's funds for the enterprise.
   ``We've found in Japan an enormous interest in the whole U.S.
communications industry,'' said Richard Koffey, managing director
of Babcock &amp; Brown. ``The Disney name is extremely well-known and
respected in Japan.''
   Koffey said the deal's balanced structure - with Disney and
Interscope sharing costs and revenues - was in response to
complaints over Japanese investment in Hollywood.
   Under the agreement, the Interscope-Nomura partnership may elect
to co-finance the films that Interscope produces for Disney. Some
of the initial projects will be selected from the 16 movies
Interscope now has in development with Disney.
   Disney and Interscope have already collaborated on several
films, including ``Three Men and a Baby'' with Ted Danson,
``Cocktail'' with Tom Cruise and Bette Midler's ``Outrageous
Fortune.''
   Interscope is an independent supplier of motion pictures,
television shows and videocassettes.
   Interscope's other productions include ``Bird on a Wire,''
``Revenge of the Nerds'' and ``Bill and Ted's Excellent
Adventure.''

   Amoco Corp. has moved closer to a joint Soviet
oil venture with the signing of a protocol to study development of
oil and gas fields in western Siberia.
   The protocol with the Soviet Union's state gas business office
was the most recent in a series of protocols resulting from
discussions that began in July 1989, Amoco said Thursday.
   It provides an opportunity for Amoco, following the completion
of a preliminary study, to conduct a detailed study of the
technical and economic feasability of developing several oil and
gas fields in western Siberia in cooperation with Soviet
organizations.
   The protocol also lists many of the guiding principles that
would be incorporated into an eventual joint venture agreement,
Amoco said.
   Amoco believes the oil and gas potential of the fields is
significant, according to Robert L. Blanton, president of Amoco
Eurasia Petroleum Co., an Amoco subsidiary.
   Several other oil companies also are pursuing joint ventures to
produce oil and gas in the Soviet Union.

   Stock prices declined broadly today as the
market absorbed new signs of stepped-up inflation and weak consumer
spending.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.14 to
2,571.53 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 7 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 199 up, 745
down and 429 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.02 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods jumped 1.3 percent in August, mostly
because of sharp rises in energy prices. Separately, the Commerce
Department said retail sales dropped 0.6 percent.
   Neither of those figures came as a drastic surprise to Wall
Street analysts, who have been busy since midsummer trying to
estimate the possible fallout from the showdown in the Middle East
and a doubling of world oil prices.
   Nevertheless, analysts said, the data served to reinforce fears
of ``stagflation,'' a combination of sluggish growth and increased
inflationary pressures.
   In that kind of climate, few market participants can see much
reason for optimism about the outlook for corporate profits and
dividends.

<TEXT>
   Asahi Breweries Ltd. said Friday it has proposed to
buy a nearly 20 percent equity stake in Elders IXL Ltd.,
Australia's largest brewer, for 110 billion yen, or about $809
million.
   The investment would be made late in October under a basic
agreement with Harlin Holding Pty Ltd. of Australia, Elder's
biggest shareholder, Asahi officials said.
   If the deal is completed, Asahi would be the second biggest
shareholder in Elders after Harlin, which currently has a 56
percent stake, the Asahi officials said.
   Peter Bartels, chief executive of Elders IXL, said in a
statement from Melbourne, ``We would welcome the opportunity
presented by this transaction for both organizations to enlarge
their presence internationally.''
   He said Elders planned to discuss the proposal from Harlin with
its its advisers and that it board would meet to consider the
matter.
   The Elders group, comprising three affiliated breweries, has a
3.5 percent share of the world's beer market.
   Its wholly-owned Carlton and United Breweries subsidiary has a
48 percent share in the Australian beer market. Its main brand is
Fosters.
   Elders has about 10 percent of the British beer market through
its Courage Ltd. unit, and its jointly-owned Molson Breweries in
Canada holds 52 percent of the Canadian beer market, according to
industry estimates.
   Asahi has a 25 percent share in Japan's beer market, up from 10
percent four years ago before its 1987 introduction of dry beer.
Dry beer is considered less sweet than regular beer and it has
proven very popular in Japan, prompting other brewers to produce
their versions of dry beer.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices shot up 1.3 percent in
August, the biggest surge in seven months, as the first shock wave
from the Persian Gulf crisis hit the American economy, the
government said today.
   The Labor Department blamed virtually the entire increase on
higher oil costs that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The fallout from the Persian Gulf turmoil has heightened
economists' fears that higher inflationary pressures could push an
already weak U.S. economy into a recession.
   In another report today, the government said retail sales
slumped 0.6 percent in August despite a huge jump in the amount of
money people spent on gasoline.
   Sales at gasoline stations climbed 6.4 percent in August, the
largest increase since an 8.3 percent advance in August 1979, the
Commerce Department said. But sales in nearly every other category
dropped to cause the downturn in consumer spending, which
represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Retail
sales account for half of consumer spending.
   Another worrisome government report issued today showed
industrial production dropped 0.2 percent in August, which
economists linked to higher energy prices and their effect on
factory activity. It was the manufacturing sector's worst monthly
performance since a similar decline in April.
   The August rise in wholesale prices, the largest since a cold
snap caused a 1.9 percent spurt in January, would translate into an
annual increase of 16.4 percent if prices rose that much each
month, the government said.
   That is far above the 3 percent advance in the Producer Price
Index from January through July.
   While prices settled down after the January increase, analysts
were worried that this inflation outbreak could become more
entrenched, filtering through to the thousands of products made
with petroleum or that must be transported long distances.
Eventually, wages that are linked to the cost of living could rise
as well, analysts said.
   ``The initial round is so large, it implies that the
ripple-through effect in coming months will be quite sizable ...
The worst is yet to come,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at
the Boston Co.
   ``The first shot of oil and energy inflation suggest a wave of
inflation in the U.S. economy that will be in high single digits
for three to six months. In turn, it will squeeze purchasing power
enough to produce a substantial recession,'' Sinai said.
   Robert Dederick of the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago said
today's data on high wholesale inflation, coupled with weak growth,
indicates that the Iraqi conflict threatens to push a vulnerable
U.S. economy into recession.
   ``It may well be the shock that broke the camel's back because
the back was already bending,'' Dederick said.
   Today's report on wholesale prices will be followed next Tuesday
by the government's first look at inflation at the consumer level
since the upheaval in the Middle East. That report is expected to
be equally bad, given the fact that pump prices of gasoline went up
almost immediately.
   In August, energy costs overall rose 9.5 percent, the government
said today. Gasoline jumped 16.9 percent while fuel oil skyrocketed
38.8 percent. Natural gas was down 9.4 percent, today's report
said.
   Inflation at earlier stages of the production process was up
sharply, too, largely due to the gulf crisis, the Labor Department
said. Crude goods jumped 9.3 percent, their steepest monthly
increase in 17 years. Intermediate goods jumped 1.3 percent.
   An example of the three processing stages would be clothing for
finished goods, cloth for intermediate and cotton for crude.
   Food prices overall were up 0.8 percent after remaining
unchanged in July. Fresh fruit prices fell 6.3 percent after
jumping 14 percent in July.
   Egg prices, which had declined by 18.3 percent in July, soared
25.8 percent in August, the government said.
   Costs were up for rice, pasta, beef, coffee and cooking oils.
Prices were down for bakery products, pork, young chickens and
dairy products.
   Prices for goods excluding volatile food and energy items -
often taken by economists as a better barometer of underlying
inflationary pressures - rose 0.3 percent. In July, this so-called
core rate had declined 0.1 percent for the first drop in a year.
   Passenger car prices were up 0.8 percent after having declined
0.5 percent in July, the government said.
   Clothing prices were mixed, with a 0.3 percent rise for women's
apparel but a 0.2 percent decline for girls', children's and
infants' clothing. There was no change in the cost of men's and
boys' apparel. Footwear fell 0.3 percent.
   Tobacco prices increased 0.9 percent and were 13.2 percent
higher than they were a year ago.
   The various changes put the Producer Price Index for all
finished goods at 119.2 in August. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 cost $119.20 last month,
up from $113.40 a year earlier.
   The overall weakness of the nation's economy - it grew at an
anemic 1.5 percent annual rate during the first half of the year -
probably kept wholesale inflation relatively low before the Middle
East erupted, analysts said.

<HEAD>Canadian Government Announces Offshore Oil Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's largest offshore oil
drilling project has been approved, and construction is expected to
begin almost immediately, the nation's federal energy minister
announced today.
   The formal go-ahead for the $5.2 billion ($4.5 billion U.S.)
Hibernia oil project off Newfoundland's coast was announced by
federal Energy Minister Jake Epp as a major advancement for the
economically troubled Atlantic province.
   ``Hibernia will bring jobs and economic diversification to
Newfoundland and all of Canada,'' he said. ``The development of the
Hibernia oil field will diversify Canada's sources of oil supply.
The opening up of this new frontier will put Canadians at the
leading edge of offshore development technologies.''
   The project is a collaboration between the federal government,
the province and a consortium of four oil companies led by Mobil
Oil Canada.
   Ottawa will contribute $2.7 billion ($2.3 billion U.S.) to the
project in cash and loan guarantees. The rest will come from the
operating companies and Newfoundland, which will help out with tax
breaks during contruction.
   The consortium estimates up to $3.1 billion ($2.7 billion U.S.)
of the total capital construction costs will go to Canadian
companies. Production is expected to start in 1996 and last about
20 years.
   The companies estimate the Hibernia field has recoverable oil
reserves of 525 million to 650 million barrels. The peak output
will be about 110,000 barrels a day.
   Epp was joined in the announcement by International Trade
Minister John Crosbie, Premier Clyde Wells, provincial Energy
Minister Rex Gibbons and several other officials.
   The announcement ends weeks of speculation about the agreement.
   The underwater oil reserve was discovered a decade ago about 190
miles southeast of St. John's. Years of negotiations followed over
issues such as the split in development costs and amount of
benefits to go to Newfoundland.
   A tentative agreement was reached in 1988. Since then, three
deadlines for a formal go-ahead have passed.
   Mobil's redesign last year of the topside sections of the
Hibernia production platform - which will house production
facilities and living quarters above the water - contributed to the
delay.
   Also, the federal government promised the consortium - which
includes Gulf Canada Resources, Chevron Canada Resources and
Petro-Canada - $2.7 billion ($2.3 billion U.S.) Canadian in cash
and loan guarantees.
   But a bill authorizing Ottawa's contribution was pulled in late
June after the collapse of a constitutional accord that stirred
controversy across Canada over recognition of Quebec's French
Canadians as a distinct society.
   Wells cancelled a vote on the accord in the Newfoundland
legislature, and Conservative Parliament members from Quebec are
believed to have threatened to vote against the bill in retaliation
for Wells's action.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's absence from the announcement
today has fueled speculation that tensions are still high.

   Investors eager to do their futures and options
trading at night will have to wait a little longer.
   Partners in Globex, a proposed 24-hour electronic system for
trading financial futures and options, said Thursday they have
pushed back the planned start-up date from November to the first
quarter of 1991.
   The latest obstacle involves modifications to accommodate
products offered by the Chicago Board of Trade, according to a
statement issued jointly by the Board of Trade, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC, a British company
that is supplying technology for the system.
   The Board of Trade joined the venture in May after abandoning
plans to develop a competing system.
   The parties also have yet to iron out a firm agreement on
sharing the operation of the system, which is subject to approval
by the Board of Trade's directors and members, according to the
two-paragraph statement.
   When the Merc and Reuters announced their Globex plans in
September 1987, they projected a launch date in the first quarter
of 1989.
   The parties said they have been pleased with the results of
testing Globex's functions.
   Globex would operate during the hours that the exchanges'
trading floors are closed.
   It would theoretically enable participating brokers around the
world to get orders filled at any time, either through the
traditional open-outcry method when the trading floors are open or
through blind order-matching by the Globex computer when the floors
are closed.

   A virtual news blackout on national contract
negotiations between the United Auto Workers union and General
Motors Corp. continued as bargainers faced a contract expiration
tonight.
   Bargaining resumed this morning, company and union officials
said. There was no all-night session Thursday.
   There was speculation Thursday night that the silence indicated
negotiators were making slow but steady progress toward a new
three-year agreement covering more than 300,000 workers at the
world's largest automaker. The current pact expires at midnight.
   Major issues yet to be resolved included job security, wages and
pensions, according to a UAW official who declined to be
identified. Tentative agreements have been reached on a variety of
mostly non-economic issues including health and safety and
attendance policy.
   The Detroit Free Press reported in today's edition that GM and
the union have agreed tentatively to a contract provision involving
UAW leaders in decisions about where auto components or entire
vehicles are made.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified union officials, said there
were no references to specific goals for increasing the use of GM
facilities and UAW workers in manufacturing parts for the huge
automaker.
   The ``sourcing'' issue has been emotional for UAW members, who
have complained the company has turned its back on unionized
American workers in favor of non-union, sometimes overseas,
factories.
   UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich, head of the union's
bargaining effort with GM, made a brief appearance Thursday night
in a hallway of the GM Building, where the negotiators are working.
He was dogged by reporters and television camera crews.
   He declined to say anything about the talks.
   ``Everybody is curious,'' Dave Perdue, president of UAW Local
276 at GM's Arlington, Texas, assembly plant, said Thursday.
``They're hungry for information.
   ``The lack of information, the lack of strike rhetoric - that
tells me I should anticipate a settlement.''
   In addition to the national contract, more than 100 GM-UAW local
contracts covering specific working conditions on a plant-by-plant
basis remained unresolved Thursday.
   Those contracts also expire at midnight, as do UAW contracts
with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   But the Ford and Chrysler talks have been put on hold pending
the outcome of negotiations between the union and GM. In all, more
than 450,000 active workers are covered by the three contracts.
   In a recorded telephone message for UAW members, Yokich said
Thursday that more work remains for negotiators who began working
on the new contract in late July.
   ``The deadline is quickly approaching and we must see more
movement by the corporation if we are to reach tentative agreement
prior to the deadline,'' he said. ``I urge you to stay in close
touch with your local officers about our plans as we approach
midnight on Friday.''
   As the deadline drew near, there was increasing speculation that
if an agreement wasn't reached before midnight, then bargainers
would extend the current contract through the weekend.
   ``We've got very little information here as far as national
negotiations,'' said Jerry Gorski, financial secretary of UAW Local
634 in Buffalo, N.Y. ``Whatever they've got they're keeping it
under their hats.
   ``I imagine they'll probably have an extension.''
   Any strike called by the UAW wouldn't have any significant
effects until Monday. Most GM plants are scheduled to close for the
weekend.
   The UAW has called a meeting of its GM bargaining council for
Monday in Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit, for local presidents and
bargaining committee heads. That announcement prompted speculation
that negotiators were closer to a settlement than a strike.
   Another union official said the meeting could be used to brief
union leaders on a strike, but it more likely would be used to
discuss a tentative settlement.
   UAW locals nationwide put the finishing touches on strike plans
Thursday.
   Mike O'Brien, president of UAW Local 95 at GM's Janesville,
Wis., truck and bus plant, said his members were prepared for a
strike. Picket line assignments have been made and signs will be
ready by the deadline.
   Meantime in Canada, bargaining continued today between officials
of the Canadian Auto Workers and Ford's Canadian subsidiary over a
contract covering about 12,800 workers. Like the UAW-GM contract,
the CAW-Ford agreement expires at midnight.
   The rhetoric in the Toronto talks has been much higher than in
the U.S. negotiations. CAW President Bob White said the two sides
remain far apart.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Mixed After Steep Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as the corn and
wheat markets sought direction after posting steep losses in the
previous session.
   The soybean market also closed lower Thursday despite a late
rally that appeared to generate some followthrough buying this
morning.
   Corn and wheat futures were narrowly mixed early in today's
session. Prices fell sharply in those markets Thursday in response
to unexepectedly large government forecasts for this year's U.S.
corn and wheat production.
   Analysts said some of this morning's selling pressure stemmed
from a National Weather Service 30-day forecast for normal
temperatures and normal to below-normal precipitation in the
Midwest and Southern Plains.
   Those conditions would be ideal for corn and soybean harvesting
and winter wheat planting.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1} cents lower to \ cent
higher with September at $2.60 a bushel; corn was { cent lower to \
cent higher with September at $2.33 a bushel; oats were unchanged
to \ cent higher with December at $1.14} a bushel; soybeans were }
cent lower to } cent higher with September at $6.22\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .10 cent higher with October
at 78.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20
cent higher with September at 88.40 cents a pound; live hogs were
.12 cent lower to .48 cent higher with October at 51.10 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .38 cent to .97 cent higher with
February at 53.97 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures ended mixed Thursday; pork futures fell.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Hit Above $32 Following Seizure of French Diplomat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures moved above $32 per barrel today on
news that Iraqi troops stormed the French Embassy in Kuwait this
morning, seizing a diplomat and three other citizens.
   ``It was the first time Bagdad's occupying forces have seized
anybody in a raid on the diplomatic community,'' said Brian Tagler,
a broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``The market's trading
up on that story pretty much alone.''
   After opening higher and climbing to $32.10 per barrel, light
sweet crude was trading late in the morning up 73 cents at $31.80
per barrel for October contracts on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Later contract months were mostly higher.
   Crude's all-time high on the exchange, $32.35 per barrel, has
been matched once during the Persian Gulf crisis, on Aug. 23.
Traders thought crude might be heading toward a record high as the
Mideast tensions increase.
   As crude moved up today, gasoline and home heating oil futures
were also on the rise.
   Unleaded gasoline was up .64 cent at 94 cents per gallon for
October delivery, while heating oil was up 1.62 cents to 85.10
cents per gallon for October delivery in late morning trading.
Later contract months for gasoline and heating oil were higher.
   Natural gas was up slightly, rising to $1.543 from $1.540 per
1,000 cubic feet.
   Trader Ed Kevelson with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said heating
oil was outperforming gasoline on the Merc because there was an
abundance of gasoline available on the cash market. Later contract
months for gasoline were moving up farther than October, showing it
nonetheless remains strong, Kevelson said.
   Kevelson said the rise in crude prices was partially
attributable to indications that the Saudis might be cutting back
on their production of sweet crude. Sweet crude, with a low sulfur
content, is best suited to U.S. refineries.
   ``You're setting up for possible sweet crude shortages in the
future,'' Kevelson said.

<HEAD>Asian Wall Street Journal To Be Printed in Thailand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc., a leading
American publisher, plans to begin printing the Asian Wall Street
Journal in Thailand within the next few months, it was announced
Friday.
   The Journal will be printed for distribution in Thailand and
some other countries in the Southeast Asian region by The Nation
Publishing Group.
   A news release from the Thai group, which publishes the
English-language daily The Nation and several magazines, said a
contract was signed Friday between the two companies.
   ``This marks the first time that Thailand will be printing a
foreign aily newspaper through a satellite linkup, setting the
stage for Bangkok to become the new publishing center in the
region,'' the release said.
   The Journal is currently being printed in Tokyo, Singapore and
Hong Kong, where the newspaper has its headquarters. It is
distributed mainly in Asia.
   The government banned the newspaper for five days last November
for printing a story that it said insulted the Buddhist supreme
patriarch. It reinstated the paper after its editor said he
regretted any offense caused.
   Dow Jones also owns the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, the Far
Eastern Economic Review and a number of other publications. It has
a 4 percent equity in The Nation Publishing Group.

<HEAD>Iberia Given Cabinet OK to Buy Lufthansa's Viva Air Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cabinet Friday authorized state-owned
Iberia Airlines to buy the 48 percent stake in charter airline Viva
Air currently held by West Germany's Lufthansa.
   The government said in a news release that the purchase by
Iberia will raise the flag carrier's control of shares in Vuelos
Internacionales de Vacaciones SA (Viva Air) to 96 percent.
   The purchase of Lufthansa's stake for the equivalent of about
$8.4 million will permit Iberia to transform Viva Air from a
tourist charter carrier to a company with regular international
flights to England, Germany and France, the release said.
   Iberia and Lufthansa founded Viva Air in February 1988. Its
original nominal share capital totaled about $17.5 million. Each
airline took a 48 percent stake.
   Other founding partners Infoleasing SA and West German tour
operator A. Paukner are expected to retain their 2 percent
interests.
   The move is in step with other Iberia efforts to expand its
European and intercontinental service.
   Last July, an Iberia-led consortium agreed to buy 85 percent of
Argentina's state carrier Aerolineas Argentinas for $130 million in
cash, $130 million in 10 installments and the retirement of $2
billion of Argentine foreign debt.
   Aerolineas ownership transfer is set for Oct. 8, although it may
be delayed.
   Lufthans officials last spring told Iberia they wanted to sell
their Viva Air stake because of concerns tourist travel to Spain
was declining and they wanted to focus on their expanding interests
in Central Europe.
   The Spanish Tourism Secretariat reported last Aug. 27 that 27.8
million tourists visited Spain through the first seven months of
the year, down 2.6 percent from the same period a year earlier.
   Iberia President Miguel Aguilo said Wednesday that Iberia
planned to have Viva Air's future flights cover travel on
``non-trunk'' international routes.
   Aguilo said those were between smaller Spanish cities and major
European cities and between smaller European cities and major
Spanish cities - flights not always profitable for Iberia.
   Viva Air owns five Boeing 737-300 aircraft, leases two DC-9
aircraft from Iberia and employs 145 people.
   In its first full year of operations last year, Viva Air
reported a profit of the equivalent of about $1.65 million on
revenue of $75.2 million.
   Last year Viva Air carried 808,603 passengers and logged 14,809
flight hours.

   Stock prices lost more ground today as the
market absorbed new signs of stepped-up inflation and weak consumer
spending.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 17.08 to
2,565.59 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 320 up, 961 down and
502 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods jumped 1.3 percent in August, mostly
because of sharp rises in energy prices. Separately, the Commerce
Department said retail sales dropped 0.6 percent.
   Neither of those figures came as a drastic surprise to Wall
Street analysts, who have been busy since midsummer trying to
estimate the possible fallout from the showdown in the Middle East
and a doubling of world oil prices.
   Nevertheless, analysts said, the data served to reinforce fears
of ``stagflation,'' a combination of sluggish growth and increased
inflationary pnking official said the government is
considering ways to renegotiate some of the sale contracts but does
not intend to break them.
   In a report released at the hearing, investigators for the
banking committee said outside investors in troubled thrifts
received $78 in assets and government-granted benefits for every $1
of capital they put up to buy the institutions.
   ``These so-called deals bear all the earmarks of a giveaway -
with the recipients of the government largesse being some of the
fattest of the nation's financial fat cats,'' Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, said at a hearing. ``We are hopeful that there
can be renegotiations that rectify some of the excesses.''
   Gonzalez said his committee will ``haunt'' the Resolution Trust
Corp., the agency responsible for disposing of failed S&amp;Ls, ``until
we have hard evidence that everything is being done to recover as
many of the billions as possible.''
   L. William Seidman, who heads the RTC and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., told the committee that the RTC's efforts ``are to
minimize costs to the government within the provisions of the
contracts.''
   ``We are not considering breaking the government's agreements,''
he said.
   The committee report concluded that 94 S&amp;L deals completed in
late 1988 will cost the government around $71 billion in assistance
to buyers of the thrifts, including up to $4.2 billion in tax
breaks.
   The investigators' study focused particularly on the sales of
American Savings Bank FA of California and two giant Texas thrifts,
Southwest Savings Association and First Gibraltar Federal Savings
Bank.
   In the American Savings and First Gibraltar deals, the buyers
were given generous tax breaks, the study said.
   A separate report released late Thursday by the General
Accounting Office found that the rescue of American Savings will
cost taxpayers $5.2 billion, three times the government's original
estimate. The institution was purchased by a group led by
billionaire investor Robert M. Bass.
   Southwest Savings was purchased in 1988 by Caroline Hunt, the
daughter of legendary oilman H.L. Hunt, with the help of government
subsidies projected to total $2 billion over 10 years. Despite the
federal aid, the thrift failed a second time and went back to the
government.
   M. Danny Wall, the former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, also was expected to testify at the hearing.
   Wall, who presided over the 1988 sales, has defended them as a
crash effort by the government to transfer into private hands
insolvent S&amp;Ls that were draining billions of dollars from the
federal insurance fund.
   But critics have charged that in its mad rush to complete the
S&amp;L sales in late 1988, the government entered into contracts that
virtually assure the buyers a profit from generous government
subsidies that will end up costing taxpayers more in the long run.
   Unless the Bush administration renegotiates some of the sales,
critics say, it would further swell the cost to taxpayers of the
S&amp;L bailout, already estimated at $500 billion.
   ``There is an obligation to renegotiate some of these deals,''
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Tuesday. Metzenbaum, who
chairs a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, said he would press the
administration to renegotiate several of the 1988 deals.
   Metzenbaum was completing a series of hearings on one of the
most controversial 1988 deals: the sale of what is now known as
Bluebonnet Savings Bank to James M. Fail, an Arizona insurance
executive.
   Fail put up only $1,000 of his own money and borrowed another
$70 million to complete a transaction that investigators said
qualified him for at least $1.85 billion in government subsidies.
The deal will cost taxpayers up to $3 billion, Metzenbaum says.
   The investigation by the House Banking Committee is one of
several conducted recently on the 1988 sales, which were made by
the now-defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. is scheduled to complete its own
study soon into whether the government would be better off by
exercising contract options allowing the government to get out of
some of the guarantees made in the 1988 deals.
   According to a recent FDIC report, the 1988 sales of around 200
failed S&amp;Ls cost taxpayers $4.6 billion in 1989. The FDIC's
estimate, which is the first official accounting of the cost, does
ot include tax breaks given to buyers of the thrifts.

   Arizona Public Service Co., following up on a
mid-year announcement that it hoped to cut capital expenditures and
trim its budget, says it will eliminate 675 full-time positions.
   APS President Mark De Michele said Thursday that one goal for
the state's largest utility was ``to reduce our pending
rate-increase request before the Arizona Corporation Commission and
work toward a period of price stability.''
   De Michele said he could not provide specifics on the size of
the reduction.
   APS executives said the cuts are needed to keep rates at a
reasonable level and match competition in the utility industry.
   In January, APS filed a $271 million rate proposal, seeking
increases of 6.8 percent in 1991, 1992 and 1993. The request has
been amended to 6.5 percent per year, or $259 million.
   A sluggish economy that has resulted in a slowdown of customer
growth also is a major factor in the cost-cutting effort. The
utility has roughly 591,000 residential and commercial customers.
   This is the third time APS has eliminated positions to try to
cut costs. It has cut 1,548 jobs since 1988, generating $63 million
in savings.
   De Michele said that, in addition to the 13 percent cut in the
company's full-time, non-nuclear workforce of 4,908, APS will
eliminate another 450 jobs by not filling vacant positions.
   The targeted jobs include those of 300 unionized employees, 315
clerical-professional positions and about 60 managers and
supervisors; they do not include about 400 jobs eliminated since
Jan. 1, when the company had nearly 5,800 full-time employees and
decided to adopt an early-retirement program.
   The reductions do not affect either employees or contract
workers at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the only
nuclear facility in the state, said APS spokesman Wayne Kaplan.
   About 2,840 people are on the Palo Verde workforce, Kaplan said.
   The statement withheld details of the company's revised filing
and stability plans and said the reorganization would take until
the end of the year to complete.
   Under the plan, employees holding jobs targeted for elimination
first will be offered positions within the company. A voluntary
severance plan will follow. Layoffs then will go into effect, APS
executives said.

<HEAD>Taiwan To Open Stock Market to Foreign Investors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan will open its stock market to
foreign institutional investors in a bid to curb speculation by
local investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced
Friday.
   Chang Chang-pang, commission chairman, said his agency wants to
allow foreign banks, insurance companies and fund management
agencies to invest in Taiwan's stocks, beneficiary certificates,
government and corporate bonds.
   ``We believe the participation of foreign institutional
investors would help curb speculation and stabilize the market,''
he said.
   Under the proposal, total foreign investment in the market would
be limited to $2.5 billion of the total $130 billion invested in
the market, Chang said. He said all transactions should be made
through designated agents or representatives in Taiwan.
   Each foreign institutional investor, who can invest between $5
million and $50 million in Taiwan stocks, can purchase up to 5
percent of the shares in a listed Taiwan stock, he said.
   However, combined foreign investment should not exceed 10
percent of any individual stock, he added.
   The commission's proposal will be submitted to the Cabinet for
final approval, he said.
   The Taiwan Stock Exchange's weighted index jumped more than 150
percent from the opening session in 1989 to 12,495.34 on Feb. 10
this year before plunging to as low as 3,135.56 on Aug. 24.
   On Friday, worries about oil price hikes sent the weighted index
down 39.64 points, or 1.14 percent, to close at 3,480.47.

   Kroger Co. veteran executive Lyle Everingham
on Friday relinquished the title of board chairman to Joseph
Pichler, the company said.
   Kroger announced at its May 17 stockholders meeting that
Pichler, 50, was moving up from president to succeed Everingham in
June as chief executive officer. Everingham, 64, who is retiring,
now has passed the chairman's title to Pichler as well.
   Everingham, who began with Kroger as a store clerk in Adrian,
Mich., in 1946, will remain as a member of the company's board of
directors. He also will continue to serve as chairman of the
executive committee until he retires in January.
   Pichler became Kroger's president and chief operating officer in
October 1986. He joined the Dillon Cos. Inc., of Hutchinson, Kan.,
in 1980 as executive vice president and came to Kroger when Dillon
became part of the company in January 1983.
   Kroger, based in Cincinnati, operates supermarkets, food
processing plants and convenience stores. It employs about 170,000
people in 32 states.

<HEAD>CBOT Turns Down Plan to Repay Stotler Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customers of the failed Stotler &amp; Co. may have to
wait up to six months to receive payments after the Chicago Board
of Trade turned down a plan to pay off $930,000 of the company's
debt.
   Stotler's court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, Ronald Peterson,
said Thursday that he proposed a plan for the Board of Trade to
cover the debt while he battles a challenge to the payment in
bankruptcy court.
   The Chicago-based futures brokerage firm filed for bankruptcy
liquidation on Aug. 24, after financial problems surfaced in
mid-July.
   Peterson said he believes there is more than enough money to pay
what is still owed to customers, an amount estimated at $2.3
million. He said he proposed the plan because Stotler's debts
``created a black eye in terms of people's confidence in the
marketplace, and it would be great publicity to do this.''
   But Board of Trade officials turned down the plan, saying that
other steps in the legal process should be used.
   ``There appears to be plenty of funds to pay out to customers,''
said Frederick Grede, vice president of the Board of Trade. ``The
trustee has to get a legal order from the bankruptcy judge to pay
those funds out.''

<HEAD>Thrift Regulators' Junk Bond Sales Ripple Market, But Don't Swamp
It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Resolution Trust Corp. has been selling an
estimated $50 million to $75 million worth of junk bonds weekly,
chipping away at its $2.9 billion portfolio from failed savings and
loans.
   For the most part, the weak junk market has been able to absorb
the selling without plunging further than it has already on fears
of a sluggish economy.
   ``There are still buyers in today's market willing to invest in
what they see has value,'' said Joseph Bencivenga, head of
high-yield, or junk bond, research at Salomon Brothers Inc.
   A number of reasons are offered for the bond market's resilience
to the RTC sales, but many point to the decision by the thrift
bailout agency to unload the securities slowly.
   ``The RTC has done a good job of metering the flow. In the
beginning people were afraid they would dump hundreds of millions a
day,'' Bencivenga said.
   During a slightly busier than normal week, the RTC sold about
$70 million worth of bonds Tuesday and offered $40 million more
Wednesday, market observers said. The RTC has been able to avoid a
great shock to a market that handles $100 million to $200 million
worth of bonds daily.
   When the government announced it would sell assets from failed
thrifts, including high-yield bonds, many feared the bond sales
would further depress the market.
   Junk prices have slumped for most of the past year since
investors became skittish after the highly leveraged retail empire
of Campeau Corp. began to come apart.
   Junk bonds pay higher interest than investment-grade bonds to
compensate for the increased risk that the company issuing the
bonds won't be able to make payments on them.
   ``I think the sales have hurt the market, but everyone has long
since discounted the sales,'' tempering the damage, said Paul
Getman, an economist at Regional Financial Associates Inc. in West
Chester, Pa. ``When it first got wind that the RTC was going to be
seizing thrifts with large junk portfolios the market really fell
apart.''
   Despite the depressed market, the RTC cannot wait for better
days. The agency is in business to get rid of the bonds and other
assets from failed thrifts and apparently wants to do it before the
market gets worse.
   The value of many of the RTC's bonds is depressed, but if the
economy continues to slow and consumers spend less, the companies
that issued the bonds may have less money to pay interest and
principal. That would push the market value of the bonds down even
further.
   Thrift regulators last week blocked Columbia Savings &amp; Loan from
selling $3 billion of its junk bonds to a group of investors
primarily from Canada and Hong Kong. Regulators apparently feared
the deal could leave the government holding the bonds if their
market value declines further.
   Under the deal, the investor group, called Gordon America LP,
would pay $300 million up front and give Columbia a 10-year note
paying 10.5 percent interest for the remaining $2.7 billion.
   Gordon America had an escape route that apparently left
regulators concerned the government would wind up getting the bonds
at a price even lower than they are now.
   If the value of the bonds fell 10 percent below the purchase
price, the buyers could have walked away from the deal, losing
their down payment but avoiding further losses. The bonds would
then go back to Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Columbia and, if it
were seized by regulators, to the government.
   Regulators say they would support an all-cash deal in which
Columbia gets rid of the bonds for good.

<TEXT>
   OPEC marked its 30th anniversary Friday
with its top official predicting the oil-producing organization
would survive the Persian Gulf crisis that has badly tarnished its
image.
   ``A world without OPEC is unthinkable for as long as oil
continues to provide the prime source of energy,'' said Subroto,
secretary-general of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   ``OPEC will stay around. We have survived crises before. ...
Surely, we'll survive this also. All disputes ultimately get
resolved,'' he said in an anniversary message carried by the
group's OPECNA news agency.
   OPEC was created by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, Iraq and
Kuwait on Sept. 14, 1960, in Baghdad, Iraq, in an effort to give
them more muscle to push up crude prices. It has since grown to 13
nations.
   Throughout its history, the cartel has had to deal with a string
of crises, including Iraq's 1980 invasion of neighbor Iran.
   This time, the oil producer moved against another neighbor,
occupying tiny Kuwait and creating more turmoil for the cartel.
   In his statement, Subroto said the group's objectives remain
sound. They include coordinating oil policies of member nations,
steadying the world market, ensuring a constant flow of oil
revenues to members and maintaining an adequate supply of crude for
consumers.
   ``Everyone is for a stable oil market,'' he said. ``No one wants
violent fluctuations in prices.''
   He said the producing nations do not want a repeat of the 1980s
when prices went on a roller-coaster ride that carried them to
almost $40 a barrel before plunging to a little more than $10.
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, crude prices have
soared. Light sweet crude, the benchmark American grade, has been
trading at about $31 a barrel.
   A basket of crudes monitored by OPEC surged last week to $28.84
a barrel, well above its target price of $21 dollars that was set
shortly before the Iraqi strike.
   Subroto, who previously was Indonesia's oil minister, said the
cartel was in a position to meet the crude requirements of
consuming nations well into the next century.
   ``No one should think otherwise because of the temporary
difficulties we face today,'' he said.
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena, who is the Algerian oil minister,
said producers and consumers can learn from the group's experience
``that what is needed is good will, not ill will; trust, not
suspicion; and cooperation, not confrontation.''
   In addition to the five founding members, the group includes
Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria,
Nigeria, Ecuador and Gabon.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange fell
sharply on Friday.
   With the tensions in the Middle East and Friday's release of an
unexpectedly high 10.6 percent August inflation rate in Britain,
caution would prevail in the market for the near future, traders
said.
   The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
33.3 points, or 1.56 percent, at 2,093.8.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed down 23.3
points at 1,609.6, while the Financial Times 500-share index closed
down 15.67 at 1,125.83.
   Volume Friday was 418 million shares, up from Thursday's 335.4
million shares traded.

<TEXT>
   Keith Adams was helping his father unload
corn on their Iowa farm one day, but he climbed into the wagon and
was sucked into the grain as if it were quicksand. He suffocated.
   Keith was 11.
   His mother, Marilyn Adams of Earlham, Iowa, soon discovered her
son's tragedy was no freak accident. Many others had been pulled
into flowing grain in wagons and bins and suffocated.
   Mrs. Adams decided to design decals warning, ``Flowing grain
traps and suffocates victims in seconds,'' and ``Never play in or
on this wagon.''
   She also broadened the scope of her crusade and formed Farm
Safety for JUST KIDS. The group produces literature and video tapes
on farm safety and arranges workshops and school presentations.
   Farming is one of the nation's most dangerous occupations, and
the families of victims of farm tragedies are using their stories
to warn others and to improve agriculture's safety record.
   ``Farmers are beginning to change their behavior and attitude,''
said Mrs. Adams. ``Mom has a reason now to tell Dad that Johnny is
not going with him to do something today. Keeping kids alive is a
top priority.''
   Farming, the nation's deadliest job in 1988, improved to second
place behind mining in 1989 with 42 deaths per 100,000 workers.
   But the death rate for all industry is nine per 100,000, and the
agriculture statistics do not include 200 to 300 deaths of
youngsters, said Larry Williams, a farm safety expert with Country
Companies Insurance Group.
   In addition to 1,300 farm deaths, 130,000 disabling injuries
occurred last year. Country Companies estimates the loss at $3.6
billion.
   Ralph Wier, 63, was hurrying to finish his farm chores so he
could go to the bank, but his tractor overturned and crushed him to
death.
   Delight Wier lost her husband in 1987. Her 3-year-old son caught
his leg in a wagon auger in 1958 and died. Her 12-year-old daughter
fell on an electric fence in 1970 and died.
   Mrs. Wier, who lives near Lacon, now writes magazine columns and
books and stresses safety to other farm families. She and son, Jon,
also practice what they preach on their 1,000-acre Marshall County
farm.
   ``We have seat belts and rollbars on our tractors and
slow-moving vehicle signs on all machinery that goes on the
highway,'' said Mrs. Wier, who has taken implement safety courses
and learned CPR.
   ``Accidents happen when farmers are under stress, so I insist
they take breaks,'' she said. ``I don't think it'sa favor to take
food to them in the field. They should stop and come in the house
and rest.''
   The best rule for farm children is to avoid the dangers, from
mowers to slurry pits.
   Various reasons for the dangers exist. Experts cite the vast
array of heavy machinery and large animals, the fatigue associated
with long hours of work during planting and harvest seasons, the
constant exposure of living at the workplace, and the long distance
to hospitals.
   ``Children seem to be attracted to farm equipment because of its
size and power,'' said Williams, adding that they also want to help
their parents.
   Children are most often injured while riding on machinery with
an adult. Farmers are most often killed when their tractors roll
over and pin them.
   Solutions can be as simple and inexpensive as not allowing extra
riders on implements, or as costly as the $400 to $1,500 to add
seat belts and rollbars to an older tractor, said Bob Aherin, a
University of Illinois farm safety specialist.
   He said farmers also are encouraged to attend safety workshops
now offered in rural communities, to read and follow instructions
in equipment manuals, to wear protective clothing, and to know
their limitations.
   Aherin said a bill in Congress would provide $320 million over
five years to improve farm safety.
   The measure would pay for research on health and safety issues,
rehabilitation programs for injured farmers, training for rescue
workers, education on farm safety, and a national data collection
system on accidents.

   Stock prices declined broadly again today as the
market absorbed new signs of stepped-up inflation and weak consumer
spending.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 24.75 to
2,557.92 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 334 up,
1,094 down and 451 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods jumped 1.3 percent in August, mostly
because of sharp rises in energy prices. Separately, the Commerce
Department said retail sales dropped 0.6 percent.
   Neither of those figures came as a drastic surprise to Wall
Street analysts, who have been busy since midsummer trying to
estimate the possible fallout from the showdown in the Middle East
and a doubling of world oil prices.
   Nevertheless, analysts said, the data served to reinforce fears
of ``stagflation,'' a combination of sluggish growth and increased
inflationary pressures.
   In that kind of climate, few market participants can see much
reason for optimism about the outlook for corporate profits and
dividends.
   Brokers also noted that stocks had to contend with rising oil
prices in the commodity markets today.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included General Motors,
down { at 37}; General Electric, down 1&lsqb; at 59\; Digital Equipment,
down 4 at 55\, and International Business Machines, down 1&lsqb; at
103~.
   Depressed bank stocks also remained on the defensive. Chemical
Banking fell } to 20&lsqb;; Citicorp &lsqb; to 17\, and Manufacturers Hanover
&rsqb; to 25\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.64 to 173.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 1.44 at 320.57.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 97.08 million shares with two

<HEAD>British Inflation Worst Among Major Industrialized Nations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dry summer and the Middle East crisis have
driven Britain's annual inflation rate up to 10.6 percent, the
highest rate in more than eight years, the government reported
Friday.
   The latest inflation rate is 0.3 percentage points higher than
the financial markets had expected, and is at its highest level
since February 1982, when it stood at 11 percent.
   The figure is also higher than the rate Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher inherited in 1979 from a Labor Party government she had
chastised for loosing control of the economy.
   ``After 11 years in power the government that promised us stable
prices has delivered us an inflation rate of 10.6 percent,'' said
lawmaker John Smith, the Labor Party's spokesman on Treasury
matters.
   But Norman Lamont, the Treasury's chief secretary, said on
British television: ``We will be content at the election to be
judged on our record. Our record over the lifetime of this
government is very much better than what we inherited, and you must
not forget that.''
   The government blamed the surging inflation on higher oil prices
caused by the Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, as well as a jump
in food prices caused by drought.
   Britain has by far the highest inflation rate among the major
industrialized nations. Italy's 6.2 percent rate is second.
   The government's forecast that high interest rates would
moderate inflation by the end of the year now looks doubtful, and
time is running out for Mrs. Thatcher's government to find a
solution before an election is required in mid-1992.
   Inflation has risen steadily even though economic growth has
declined since Mrs. Thatcher won her third consecutive five-year
term in June 1987.
   The government's chosen cure has become as painful as inflation.
With interest rates at 15 percent for a year, the number of house
repossessions has doubled since the second half of 1989.
   The problems started when the government lowered interest rates
in 1988 to prevent a recession after the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   This year's inflation outlook will remain clouded by the Mideast
crisis, although economists say the world's economies are better
prepared to handle oil shocks than they were in the 1970s.
   The current problems contrast with the mid-1980s, when Britain
was enjoying a sustained economic boom and Mrs. Thatcher was
credited with curing Britain's economic disease.
   Inflation, which had crested at 21.9 percent during a recession
in May 1980, had dropped to a 20-year low of 2.4 percent in July
1986.
   Now the socialist Labor Party considers itself justified in
criticizing the government's economic policies. Labor had been
widely blamed for soaring inflation, high interest rates and
militant unionism in the 1970s.
   In August 1975, under a Labor government, inflation peaked at
26.9 percent.
   On Friday, Labor spokesman Smith blamed the current rise in
inflation on the goernment's ``massively incompetent economic
mismanagement.''
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major conceded in radio
interviews that Britain's inflation was a ``good deal higher than
we would wish to see it'' but maintained that inflation was not
``out of control.''
   Although some economists and businessmen fear continued high
interest rates will tip Britain into a recession, Major reiterated
his commitment to holding interest rates high until he feels
inflation is defeated.
   Major declined to say when inflation might peak and when
interest rates might come down.

<HEAD>Operations at Kuwaiti-Owned U.S. Companies Return To Normal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six weeks after the government froze Kuwait's
U.S. assets to prevent Iraq from seizing them, Kuwaiti-owned
companies in this country say operations are back to normal thanks
to exemptions granted by the Treasury Department.
   Customers and suppliers of Santa Fe International in Alhambra,
Calif., initially expressed concern about dealing with the
Kuwaiti-owned oil drilling company following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait, said Vice President John Mika.
   ``They wanted assurance that they were not violating any freeze
order by continuing their relationship with us,'' he said.
   But the Treasury ``cooperated quite well with us'' in granting
the exemption, which allows the company to continue writing checks,
making payroll and otherwise operate normally, he said.
   At Georgetown Industries, a Kuwaiti-owned steel company in
Charlotte, N.C., ``our business is very much business as usual,''
said President Roger Regelbrugge.
   ``We have no other restrictions than that we are not supposed to
transfer assets to the government of Kuwait or to Iraq,'' he said.
   The Hilton Hotels Corp., whose Atlanta Hotel &amp; Tower is owned by
the Kuwaiti government, also has had no problems, said spokeswoman
Kendra Silverman.
   Estimates of Kuwait's U.S. investments vary widely - from under
$10 billion to more than $50 billion - because of the nation's
policy of secrecy. One investment industry source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Kuwait bars its investment managers
from speaking publicly about its assets.
   ``A great deal of it is going to be unknown,'' said Scott
Rogers, a Mideast economist at the economic research firm
DRI-McGraw-Hill.
   Kuwait's overall foreign assets last year totaled an estimated
$124 billion, according to DRI-McGraw-Hill. Much of that is in
Europe, and includes such high-profile investments as a 14 percent
stake in Daimler-Benz AG, the German auto, electronics and
aerospace giant.
   Santa Fe International, which state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp.
bought for $2.5 billion in 1981, is believed to be the Mideast
nation's largest single U.S. holding.
   Among Kuwait's other U.S. assets are stakes in several hotels, a
bank holdingcompany, a real estate investment company and
undeveloped land, along with stock and bond holdings in various
U.S. companies.
   Other known Kuwaiti government assets in the United States,
according to the New York-based newsletter MidEast Report and other
sources, include:
   - Occidental Geothermal Inc. of Los Angeles, which Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. bought for $350 million in 1984.
   - About 12 percent of Corporate Property Investors, which owns
real estate in New York as well as a number of shopping malls
nationwide.
   - An undetermined stake in First American Bankshares Inc., a
bank holding company in Washington, D.C.
   - Forty-five percent of the Phoenecian resort in Scottsdale,
Ariz., which was controlled by scandal-plagued Lincoln Savings and
Loan until the federal government took over Lincoln's share.
   - Forty-five percent of the Crescent hotel in Phoenix.
   In addition, private Kuwaiti investors - not subject to the
asset freeze - hold an undertermined stake in Investcorp, which
owns the Saks Fifth Avenue department stores and other properties.
   MidEast Report estimates Kuwait's U.S. assets at $50 billion.
   Not even the Treasury Department, charged with enforcing the
asset freeze, has a complete accounting of Kuwait's U.S.
investments. The department began a list after Iraq's invasion, but
had not finished it as of Friday, a spokeswoman said.
   The Treasury would not disclose which companies have been
granted exemptions.
   The spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified, said the
exemptions were designed ``to allow the Kuwati government to
conduct its normal business in the smoothest way possible while
assuring that no benefits accrue to Iraq.''
   The department also has issued general exemptions for categories
of companies, such as telephone and foreign exchange companies,
that meet certain conditions.
   According to one measure by the Commerce Department, Kuwait's
direct investments in U.S. companies totaled $4.2 billion last
year. That figure does not account for investments made through
intermediaries such as Kuwaiti companies not based in Kuwait.
   Nor does it include investments in companies that result in less
than 10 percent of the voting stock, nor Kuwait's ``portfolio''
accounts of stocks, bonds and other investments being managed by
U.S. investment houses.
   David T. Mizrahi, editor of MidEast Report, estimates 25 percent
of Kuwait's U.S. assets are held in portfolio accounts at firms
including J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. and
Citicorp.
   By a broader measure last taken in 1988, the value of all U.S.
companies in which Kuwait held at least 10 percent control totaled
$10 billion.
   But since that Commerce Department figure includes the full
value of those companies no matter what the size of Kuwait's stake,
most likely overstates Kuwait's investment.
   Former Treasury Secretary G. William Miller helps manage
Kuwait's U.S. assets, MidEast Report says. Among Kuwait's U.S.
investment groups is the Wafra Investment Advisory Group of New
York, which invests Kuwaiti pension funds.
   Much of Kuwait's assets worldwide are managed by the Kuwaiti
Investment Office in London.

<HEAD>Telefonica Takes 6 Percent Stake in AT&amp;T's Main European Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain's Telefonica SA said Friday it had
reached an agreement to take a 6 percent stake in American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s main European holding company in
exchange for its 20 percent share in a Spanish microchip company.
   In a joint statement, state-controlled Telefonica said it was
swapping its 20 percent share in AT&amp;T Microelectronica SA for 6
percent of Netherlands-based AT&amp;T Network Systems International BV,
or AT&amp;T-NSI.
   AT&amp;T-NSI will now own 100 percent of AT&amp;T Microelectronica,
which in 1985 built a $200 million custom microchip factory just
north of Madrid.
   Telefonica President Candido Velazquez called the accord ``an
important step in the growing process of internationalization of
Telefonica, permitting us to directly participate in a European
project like ATT-NSI.''
   AT&amp;T President Robert Allen said the agreement ``permits us to
widen our European perspectives and strengthen our position as a
global company.''
   The U.S. company owned a 65 percent stake in its ATT-NSI
European unit. Italy's state-controlled STET owns 15 percent and
the Netherlands' N.V. Philips Gloeilampen fabrieken owns another 15
percent.
   ATT-NSI produces software and hardware products for most of
Europe's public telecommunications networks.
   Earlier Friday, AT&amp;T Network Systems Espana presented a new,
$100 million factory, which will provide 250,000 telephone lines to
Telefonica through 1990 and 300,000 lines in 1991.

   Here with brief descriptions are some of the
issues being discussed in national contract talks between the
United Auto Workers union and General Motors Corp. as bargaining
entered the final hours Friday.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>JOB SECURITY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The overriding issue in the negotiations. The union wants
employment guarantees for a large number of its members while GM
wants flexibility to reduce its size. There are about 300,000
active UAW-covered workers at GM plants nationwide.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WAGES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The union and GM have refused to release details of proposals.
But an early GM offer reportedly involved a 2 percent increase in
base wages in the first year and 2 percent lump-sum payments in
each of the next two.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HEALTH CARE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers have said they desperately need to cut health-care
costs and the union said it will not stand for a reduction in
benefits. Ways to cut costs include more movement to managed
health-care systems, such as health maintenance organizations, and
more active monitoring of claims.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>PENSIONS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A large group of UAW members have pushed their leadership to
demand cost-of-living protection keyed to the inflation rate. UAW
and company officials have conceded that could cost billions of
dollars. More likely is a lump-sum increase for retirees.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ABSENTEEISM</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   GM and the UAW have agreed to an entirely new program that says
workers with more than 16 unexcused absences a year would be
disciplined.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Agreement has been reached on a long-term GM commitment to help
workers seek counseling for substance abuse and other problems.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>LEGAL ASSISTANCE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   GM has agreed to boost payments to a legal assistance program
for UAW workers until the fund reaches $10 million. Then the
automaker can scale back contributions.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>QUALITY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Both sides have agreed that at least one employee in each plant
will have the full-time job of monitoring quality.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CHILD CARE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilot program was agreed to under which a child-care center
would be established to replace the current referral service.
Chrysler Corp. is building such a center at its Huntsville, Ala.,
parts plant.

   Corn and wheat futures prices extended their
losses Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade while most soybean
futures advanced, all in a continuing reaction to a recent
government crop report.
   The Agriculture Department report released Wednesday contained
projections for 1990 U.S. corn and wheat production that were
higher than the market expected.
   The USDA also predicted the nation's soybean stockpile would
continue to dwindle due to strong world demand for soybean meal and
a smaller harvest next spring in Brazil, the world's second-largest
soybean producer after the United States.
   ``People are getting bullish on the meal, and meal exerts a lot
of influence over soybeans,'' said Joel Karlin, grains analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Karlin said wheat futures also were pressured by Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter's pledge to oppose an increase in crop
set-aside acreage as a means of stemming a slide in wheat prices.
   Yeutter told a farmers group in Chicago that taking more crop
acreage out of production would ultimately make the United States
less competitive in the world market.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2} cents to 4\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.57 a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 2 cents lower with September at $2.32} a bushel; oats
were unchanged to \ cent higher with September at $1.07 a bushel;
soybeans were } cent lower to 4 cents higher with September at
$6.24{ a bushel.

   Stock prices fell again today as the market
absorbed new signs of stepped-up inflation and weak consumer
spending.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 23.02 to
2,559.65 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 399 up,
1,055 down and 464 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods jumped 1.3 percent in August, mostly
because of sharp rises in energy prices. Separately, the Commerce
Department said retail sales dropped 0.6 percent.
   Neither of those figures came as a drastic surprise to Wall
Street analysts, who have been busy since midsummer trying to
estimate the possible fallout from the showdown in the Middle East
and a doubling of world oil prices.
   Nevertheless, analysts said, the data served to reinforce fears
of ``stagflation,'' a combination of sluggish growth and increased
inflationary pressures.
   In that kind of climate, few market participants can see much
reason for optimism about the outlook for corporate profits and
dividends.
   Brokers also noted that stocks had to contend with rising oil
prices in the commodity markets today.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included General Motors,
down { at 37}; General Electric, down 1 at 59&rsqb;; Digital Equipment,
down 3&rsqb; at 55~, and International Business Machines, down 1&lsqb; at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.36 to 173.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Falling Output Another Indication of a Lethargic Economy</HEAD>

   Industrial production fell 0.2 percent in
August, its worst performance in four months, the government said
Friday in a report analysts said was another indication the
manufacturing economy remains locked in lethargy.
   ``The industrial side is clearly signalling a slumping
economy,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp;
Co., a New York government securities dealer.
   It was the government's first report on factory activity since
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2. But the manufacturing economy
had been sluggish long before that, growing a meager 1.5 percent
over the last year, the Federal Reserve said.
   In a companion report, the central bank said the operating rate
of the nation's factories, mines and utilities - which usually
moves in tandem with industrial production - fell 0.4 percentage
point to 83.1 percent. The operating rate measures not only output
but also changes in productivity levels.
   ``It's consistent with the other data, for example, the
manufacturing employment figures, ... the National Association of
Purchasing Management index,'' said Evalina Tainer, senior domestic
economist with the First National Bank of Chicago. ``It continues
to show the manufacturing sector is quite sluggish.''
   The Labor Department reported last week that 45,000 factory jobs
were lost in August. It was the 16th time in 17 months that
manufacturing jobs declined.
   The monthly survey by the purchasing executives last week showed
the manufacturing sector had slowed in August for the second
straight month. Their index was down to 47.0 percent. When the
index registers below 50 percent, it indicates the economy is
weakening.
   In fact, economist Gordon Richards of the National Association
of Manufacturers and Richard W. Rahn, chief economist with the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said in separate statements the economy may
have slipped into a recession in August.
   Only utilities posted a gain in production, up 1.2 percent. But
Richards noted the advance was due to electric power and ``may have
been little more than a seasonal factor'' during the
airconditioning season.
   None of the other major components showed a gain.
   The manufacturing sector was off 0.1 percent, including a 0.2
percent drop in output of durable goods, items expected to last
more than three years. Non-durable output was unchanged, while
mining production plunged 2.3 percent.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in August stood at
109.8 percent of its 1987 base, down from 110.0 percent in July.
   In its capacity utilization report, the Fed said the operating
rate at factories producing durable goods fell 0.4 percentage point
to 81.4 percent, while the rate at plants making non-durable goods
slipped 0.2 percentage point to 83.8 percent.
   The operating rate at mines fell from 89.7 percent in July to
87.8 in August, while it gained 1 percentage point to 86.9 percent
at utilities.

management and labor leaders involved in national contract
negotiations between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>GENERAL MOTORS CORP.</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NAME: Robert Stempel.
   POSITION: Chairman and chief executive officer.
   AGE: 57.
   BACKGROUND: Stempel took over the world's largest corporation on
Aug. 1, and is GM's first engineer-trained chairman. He joined the
automaker's Oldsmobile Division in 1958 and held various design and
engineering positions in that division until 1973 when he was
appointed special assistant to GM President Edward N. Cole.
   The following year he moved to the Chevrolet Division where he
served in a variety of engineering divisions. After a two-year
stint in GM's Pontiac Division, Stempel headed overseas where he
was appointed managing director of Adam Opel AG of West Germany in
1980. He returned to the United States as Chevrolet's general
manager in 1982.
   He was promoted to head the Buick-Oldsmobile Cadillac Group
before becoming an executive vice president in 1986. The following
year, he became GM's 17th president, a post he held until he
succeeded retired GM Chairman Roger B. Smith.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NAME: Alfred S. Warren Jr.
   POSITION: Vice president of industrial relations.
   AGE: 64.
   BACKGROUND: Warren, born in Aliquippa, Pa., took his current
position on Sept. 1, 1980, and is the veteran among this year's top
negotiators. He joined GM in 1959 as assistant personnel director
at Chevrolet's Tonawanda engine plant in Buffalo, N.Y., and was
promoted to several plant manager positions. He was transferred to
the company's personnel administration staff in October 1973.
   Warren is a champion of joint company-union programs and worked
closely with retired UAW Vice President Donald Ephlin in
implementing a variety of joint programs in GM.

   BACKGROUND: Bieber, a native of North Dorr, Mich., joined the
UAW in 1948 while working at McInerney Spring and Wire Co. in Grand
Rapids, Mich. He rose through the ranks through Local 687 before
being appointed to the international union's staff in 1961.
   He served as an assistant director and director in Region 1D in
southwest lower Michigan. He was elected as a UAW vice president in
1980 and was appointed head of the union's GM Department, a post he
held before being elected president of the one million-member union
in 1983.

<HEAD>Extended Trading Hours, Rumors and a Sad-Damn Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't the biggest headline of the week, but
the New York Stock Exchange's approval of extended trading hours
provided an entry for the history books.
   The board of the world's best-known stock market put its stamp
on the first stages of a plan that could lead to round-the-clock
trading within five to 10 years.
   Approved were two after-hours trading sessions that will allow
big market players to execute trades after the NYSE's closing bell
at 4 p.m. Eastern time.
   Up to now, such business has been flowing overseas; hence the
motivation for the exchange's unprecedented move.
   It was a small step - the sessions will only last about an hour
and are aimed at big stock traders, not individuals - but the late
sessions are nevertheless a giant leap for the tradition-bound Big
Board.
   The sessions won't require the services of the so-called
``specialists'' who manage trading on the floor of the exchange
during regular business hours. The post-close sessions propose to
match buyers and sellers electronically, as they are in London.
   The new ``crossing sessions'' won't radically alter Wall Street
life as the world knows it. Individual stocks will trade at their
closing prices.
   But later stages of the plan call for stock auctions several
times a night, and then 24-hour trading before the year 2000.

<HEAD>MARKETS: Rumors Haunt the Pits</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Six weeks into the Persian Gulf crisis, rumors were supplanting
headlines as the currency of the financial markets. Oil futures
trading, in particular, caromed from rumor to rumor.
   The impact was most apparent Monday, when lower oil prices were
suddenly pushed higher on reports of Iraqi troop movement toward
Jordan.
   Officials at the New York Mercantile Exchange, seeming more
suspicious than usual about the circulation of false reports, said
they would investigate to determine whether any gossip was being
spread to influence prices.
   Meanwhile, oil appeared to be establishing a base at $30 per
barrel, evidence to some experts that the rumor mill was helping
support that floor.
   Stocks, for their part, started to pay more attention to the
economy. A 43-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average
Thursday was blamed on fears of rising inflation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMY: Fears Are Panning Out</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Inflation worries were confirmed by the wholesale price report
issued Friday, which showed a big 1.3 percent jump in August. The
Labor Department blamed the increase on Gulf-inspired oil price
hikes.
   Most other economic newswas bad as well. The government said
retail sales slumped 0.6 percent last month despite a jump in
spending at gasoline stations.
   The combination of sluggish growth and increased inflation
revived fears of ``stagflation,'' the old bugaboo that haunted the
economy in the 1970s.
   One market economist, Roger Brinner of DRI McGraw-Hill, said it
was up to the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and spare the
economy from a ``Sad-damn recession,'' coining a reference to the
man behind Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BANKS: Reaching a Crisis Point</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A recession could wipe out bank deposit insurance funds and
require a bailout along the lines of the savings and loan rescue,
Congress was told.
   Reports on the banking sector from the General Accounting Office
and Congressional Budget Office were the bleakest seen to date.
   Even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan agreed the situation was grim,
but he warned Congress against hasty action that could precipitate
a crisis.
   Still, lawmakers readied bills to raise bank insurance premiums
and limit coverage on deposits.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: A Merger Battle Erupts</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Aon Corp. launched a $840 million bid for the insurer Corroon &amp;
Black Corp., setting up Wall Street's first big merger contest in
months. The new bid competes with a stock swap Corroon had already
arranged with Willis Faber PLC of London. Corroon said it would
study the new proposal.
   American Airlines said it would go to court to reverse a
government decision allowing United Airlines landing priorities at
Chicago's O'Hare airport. The move heightened the feud between the
two carriers over evening landing schedules at the nation's busiest
airport.
   Coca-Cola was proclaimed the strongest brand name in the world
by a consulting firm. Sony and Mercedes-Benz were runners-up.
   Testifying to the importance of imagery, retailer K mart Corp.
unveiled a new red logo to counter its reputation as blue-light
discounter. And the RCA division of Thomson Consumer Electronics
announced it was bringing back Nipper the dog, of ear to the
gramophone fame, for a new round of television commercials. The

<HEAD>PEOPLE: The Pros and Cons of Sentencing Milken</HEAD>

   Fallen financial star Michael Milken was back in the headlines
as his sentencing on six felonies neared.
   Government prosecutors, who had doggedly pursued the junk-bond
king for four years before his guilty pleas in April, planned to
lay open their full case against him to influence his sentencing
Oct. 1.
   They planned to allege additional crimes to persuade the judge
not to go easy on the financier.
   Milken was not without his supporters, though. Scores of letters
were filed with the Manhattan court testifying to Milken's
otherwise upstanding character.
   Among his advocates were Time Warner Inc. Chairman Steven J.
Ross; Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.; and
former ``Let's Make a Deal'' host Monty Hall.

bad taste.
   McInvale dispatched pizzas to two public health hospitals for
several nights - with business cards attached.
   The attorney insisted he wasn't trying to solicit business, but
local prosecutors looked askance at the practice and asked him to
cease and desist.
   Texas Bar authorities reckoned it was their first-ever ethics

<HEAD>Tucker Named Head of Saatchi's US Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The troubled advertising giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Co. PLC said Friday that Martin Tucker has been named president and
chief executive of its holdings in the United States.
   Tucker, formerly the U.S. operation's general counsel, replaces
W. Jonathan T. Hirst, who is resigning to pursue ``other career
interests,'' Saatchi said.
   Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the chief executive of the London-based
parent company, said Hirst, 41, had told him several months ago
that he wanted to pursue other interests once he had completed the
sale of the Saatchi consulting business, and that that task ``was
now virtually done.''
   Hirst had been with Saatchi for eight years, including two as
head of its U.S. operations.
   Efforts to reach the three Saatchi executives were unavailing.
   London-based Saatchi got its start as an advertising company but
grew rapidly over the past decade, branching out into management
consulting in an effort to offer its advertising and marketing
clients more services.
   But the results from consulting have been poor and the company
decided to sell its consulting businesses. Some of them have been
sold for only a fraction of what Saatchi paid for them, however.
   For the first half of this year, Saatchi reported it lost about
$13.4 million, mainly reflecting losses on the sale of two
consulting businesses. A week ago the company said its balance
sheet was too weak to pay a regular dividend.
   Louis-Dreyfus said Tucker, 67, brings ``many years of experience
in the advertising business, both as a lawyer and executive'' to
the new post as president and chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Holdings (USA) Inc.
   ``His appointment underscores our company's decision to
concentrate on its core communications business,'' Louis-Dreyfus
said.
   He said Hirst will remain as a consultant to the company to
complete the previously announced sale of Gartner Group Inc. and to
assist Tucker in transition.
   Gartner is being sold to an investor group for $55 million in
cash and $15 million in notes and other obligations. But Saatchi
paid $86 million for Gartner only two years ago.
   ``Jonathan Hirst has made many outsanding contributions to the
company during the past eight years, not the least of which was the
sale of the consulting group companies in the difficult business
and financing conditions of the past year. We wish him well for the
future,'' Louis-Dreyfus said.
   Saatchi operates the giant ad agencies Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising and Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide.
   In addition, it owns the ad agencies Campbell-Mithun-Esty,
McCaffrey &amp; McCall, AC&amp;R and Conill Advertising. It owns public
relations and design firms, a direct marketing agency and several
smaller management consulting firms.

   Manpower PLC has agreed to sell five British

British companies being sold, have formed Brook Opportunities Ltd.
to make the acquisition, he said.
   The other four companies are Blue Arrow Personnel Services,
Extrastaff, DP Support Services and IPS Group.
   The companies, all in the temporary and permanent placement
business, together brought in 15 percent to 20 percent of
Manpower's total sales, Fromstein said.
   ``It's quite a relief,'' Fromstein said. ``It's a relief because
the market is weak today. So we've had to work very hard to get
this thing done. We are satisfied with it.''
   Fromstein said the sale, which is expected to close Oct. 4,
would allow Manpower to pay down debt. The next steps include
incorporating Manpower as a U.S. company, he said.
   The deal calls for Manpower to receive $200 million in cash plus
15 percent of the voting share capital of the acquiring company.
After the sale, Manpower will buy an additional $4 million in
variable nonvoting preference shares of the new company.
   The sale is part of a planned divestiture of companies that made
up the Blue Arrow Group before it acquired Manpower in 1987.
   Fromstein subsequently took control of Blue Arrow and moved
Manpower's headquarters from London to the Milwaukee suburb of
Glendale. At the time, the company said it would sell non-Manpower
subsidiaries to retire long-term debt.
   The leveraged buyout announced Friday will include an equity
investment of about $80 million. The remainder of the purchase
price will be borrowed from banks.
   In June, Manpower sold a group of six non-Manpower subsidiaries
in the U.S. for $46 million in cash.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher in New York; Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished modestly higher against most
major foreign currencies in U.S. trading Friday after news of a
flareup in the Middle East conflict abruptly reversed a dollar
slide.
   Gold prices gained.
   Initially, the dollar moved lower as trading opened in New York,
continuing a trend based on a bearish U.S. economic outlook.
Government reports released early in the session confirmed that
deteriorating economic conditions are being accompanied by rising
inflation.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index
jumped 1.3 percent in August, due mostly to steep oil price
increases. Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales
dropped 0.6 percent.
   The figures didn't surprise financial markets but they added to
a pile of pessimistic economic data.
   It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve Board will modify
its monetary policy to revive growth. If the central bank pushes
down interest rates, demand for dollars and dollar-based
investments would decline.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a congressional committee
Thursday the central bank would be inclined to ease policy if White
House and congressional negotiators reach a credible agreement on
cutting the budget deficit.
   Speculation about imminent Fed action intensified Friday when
word circulated that a deficit accord could come over the weekend
or early next week.
   But currency traders put aside their economic concerns when news
broke that U.S. and Australian Navy ships had fired warning shots,
halted and then boarded an Iraqi tanker in the Gulf of Oman.
   That news, plus earlier information about Iraqi troops breaking
into the French Embassy residence in Kuwait City, spurred dollar
purchases.
   Investors and speculators typically turn to dollars at times of
international turmoil. Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the
dollar periodically has been bid up sharply.
   Robert Gruber, senior corporate trader at Chemical Bank, said
U.S. trading was hectic and volatile before settling down, as it
usually does on Fridays.
   He said once it became apparent that an actual shooting war
wasn't breaking out in the Mideast, the dollar buying subsided.
   On foreign exchange markets abroad, the dollar lost ground
against the Japanese yen and German mark but weakened vs, the
British pound, as it did in New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 136.55 Japanese yen from
137.65 yen at Thursday's close. It was the lowest closing level
since Aug. 3, 1989, when it was 136.40 yen. Later, in London, the
dollar fell to 136.65 yen. But in New York the dollar ended
dealings at 136.45 yen, up from 136.25 yen late Thursday.
   The British pound rose to $1.8980 from $1.8770 late Thursday.
The pound climbed in New York also, ending the session at $1.8930
compared to $1.8825 late Thursday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late
quotes Thursday, included: 1.5695 German marks, up from 1.5680;
1.2990 Swiss francs, down from 1.3025; 5.2565 French francs, up
from 5.2520; 1,171.75 Italian lire, up from 1,170.00; and 1.16505
Canadian dollars, up from 1.16175.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
levels were: 1.5625 German marks, down from 1.5740; 1.2910 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3130; 5.2305 French francs, down from 5.2710;
1.7605 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7740; 1,166.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,174.00; and 1.1648 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1640.
   Gold prices posted minor increases.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
September delivery rose $2.20 to settle at $385.10. Republic
National Bank later quoted a bid of $385.75 an ounce, $1.75 higher
than Thursday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $385.25 a troy ounce from
$384 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of
$385.00 from $383.40 late Thursday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold
rose $2.52 to close at a bid of $384.34 an ounce.
   Silver prices moved lower. The metal fell on New York's Comex
with the contract for September delivery closing at $4.750 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's settlement of $4.773. Silver bullion
fell in London to a late bid of $4.79 dollars a troy ounce from
$4.82 late Thursday.

   Stock prices kept falling Friday, weighed down
by new signs of stepped-up inflation and weak consumer spending.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 18.56 to
2,564.11, extending its loss for the week to 55.44 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
472 up, 1,008 down and 470 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods jumped 1.3 percent in August, mostly because of
sharp increases in energy prices. Separately, the Commerce
Department said retail sales dropped 0.6 percent.
   Neither of those figures came as a drastic surprise to Wall
Street analysts, who have been busy since midsummer trying to
estimate the possible fallout from the showdown in the Middle East
and a doubling of world oil prices.
   Nevertheless, analysts said, the data served to reinforce fears
of ``stagflation,'' a combination of sluggish growth and increased
inflationary pressures.
   In that kind of climate, few market participants can see much
reason for optimism about the outlook for corporate profits and
dividends.
   Brokers also noted that stocks had to contend with rising oil
prices in the commodity markets. Crude oil for October delivery
climbed 69 cents a barrel to $31.76 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange amid resurgent worries about the continuing showdown in
the Persian Gulf.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included General Motors,
down } at 37{; General Electric, down ~ at 59{; Digital Equipment,
down 2~ at 56&rsqb;, and International Business Machines, down | at
104&rsqb;.
   Bank stocks, which had a rocky weak amid persistent
credit-crunch worries, turned in a mixed showing. Chemical Banking
fell | to 20\, and Citicorp slipped &lsqb; to 17\, while J.P. Morgan
rose { to 32| and BankAmerica was unchanged at 21}.
   Energy issues also finished mixed. Exxon gained | to 51&rsqb;; Texaco
added &lsqb; to 64{; Atlantic Richfield rose 1&lsqb; to 139~; Mobil dropped &lsqb;
to 65{, and Chevron was down &lsqb; at 75~.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 133.39 million
shares, against 123.37 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 159.71 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $17.05 billion, or 0.56
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.01 to 174.15.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.28 to 374.60, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.82 at 316.83.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.76 to 374.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 321.45, down .56.

   The Senate cleared the way Friday for action
on a bill that would require automakers to dramatically increase
fuel economy.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he hoped
to have a vote late next week on the bill that would require
automakers to increase average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles
per gallon by 1995 and to 40 miles per gallon by 2001.
   Supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements would
save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day once they go fully into
effect, but key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure
on the Senate floor.
   Within hours of the vote, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner blasted the legislation as ``unrealistic, irresponsible
and, more important, unattainable.'' He said there's no technology
to achieve the bill's goals without making cars smaller.
   ``It should be called the highway fatality bill,'' Skinner said
at a news conference, citing a new study by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration that concluded a clear link between
reducing the size of cars and traffic deaths.
   The NHTSA study said the introduction of smaller cars over the
past decade had resulted in an estimated 1,340 additional traffic
deaths annually in single-car accidents. Based on those numbers,
NHTSA Administrator Jerry Curry said between 600 and 1,140
additional deaths annually can be expected if automakers try to
meet the 40 mile per gallon standard.
   Skinner said automakers had convinced him that the Senate bill's
fuel economy goals can't be achieved without substantial weight
reductions in cars.
   ``We've just had the first inning of this nine-inning game,''
Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said after the Senate voted 68-28 to
clear the way for debate.
   ``We hope and intend to win this fight,'' Riegle said, adding
that he doubts supporters will get the needed 60 votes to cut off
debate and bring it to a vote next week.
   A similar bill has been introduced in the House, but it has yet
to be taken up by the Energy and Commerce Committee, whose
chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., is staunchly opposed to the
measure.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sponsor of the House bill, said
earlier this week she would try to push the legislation directly on
the House floor in an effort to bypass Dingell's committee.
   But the Senate's 68-28 vote Friday to cut off efforts by Riegle
to keep the measure off the Senate floor was an indication of the
growing support in Congress for a measure to reduce U.S. reliance
on foreign oil, a subject in the spotlight since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``It's the single most important step to reducing our dependency
on OPEC oil and curbing global warming,'' the Sierra Club said of
the bill sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
   In floor debate, Riegle said those fuel savings aren't likely to
begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to today's oil
crisis might be to return to a national speed limit of 55 miles an
hour.
   Later, a Riegle aide said the senator didn't necessarily support
a change in the speed limit.
   Bryan described his bill as a message to Detroit and the
automakers ``that they're going to have to look at fuel economy and
not just muscle cars.''
   ``It does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we don't
start conserving now, some future president may have to consider
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the Middle
East,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sears Consolidates Merchandise Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. announced the resignations
of two retailing executives Friday in a further realignment of the
merchandise division's management as part of efforts to reduce
expenses.
   Under the realignment, officers in charge of the company's six
merchandise categories will now report directly to retail President
Laurence E. Cudmore.
   The changes follow a management shake-up last month in which
Sears' board put Chairman Edward A. Brennan directly in charge of
the Sears Merchandise Group, the nation's largest retailer.
   Brennan took the helm from Michael Bozic, formerly chairman and
chief executive of the merchandise division. Bozic was reassigned
to a new position as president of the group and assumed
reponsibility for logistics and the group's catalog.
   ``We are eliminating a layer of management and consolidating
certain corporate and merchandise group staff areas,'' Brennan said
in a news release.
   Under the realignment, Matthew A. Howard, formerly senior vice
president in charge of hard merchandise lines, will become senior
vice president of marketing, replacing Thomas E. Morris, who
resigned.
   Eric D. Saunders, formerly senior vice president of soft lines,
will become vice president of the home fashions group, succeeding
Jerry A. Hand, who also resigned.
   The company said Morris and Hand resigned to pursue other
interests.
   Sears is seeking to cut costs to offset declining profits from
its retail division. The company plans to review costs at all
levels of management, Cudmore has said.
   An effort Sears began last year to preserve market share by
revamping its merchandise strategy still hasn't borne fruit,
according to retail analysts.
   Sears' double-pronged program involving the introduction of more
national brands, from General Electric appliances to Pirelli tires,
and a switch to an everyday low pricing policy appears to be
sparking little buying enthusiasm among customers, analysts say.

   After the summer slide Wall Street has been
through, many an investor might be tempted to go scavenging for
``bargains'' in the stock market.
   But even though stock prices have been marked down sharply, Wall
Street analysts remain leery of pronouncing them cheap just yet.
   By most traditional measures, stocks are now well below the
extremes of valuation they reached at past peaks.
   Most analysts agree that atmosphere of restrain lessens the
chances of anything resembling a repeat of the crash of 1987, when
the market lost more than a third of its value in a span of less
than two months.
   At the same time, they say, readings on most of the gauges they
monitor still stand well above the levels that showed up at market
bottoms in the past.
   ``The world equity markets toward the end of August were very
close to panic point, oversold extreme, selling climax or whatever
you want to call it,'' said Barton Biggs at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Still, Biggs added, measures of things like investor sentiment
and market momentum ``are not yet at bear-market bottom extremes,
and it will probably take at least a few more months for them to
get there.''
   One of the most common standards applied to market values is
price-earnings ratios - a simple computation of how much investors
are willing to pay for stocks in relation to the current annual
earnings of the company or companies involved.
   P-E multiples for the various market averages and indexes
recently have hovered in the 12.5 to 15 range - well below the
readings of 20 or more that have been attained in past periods of
exuberance, but still far from the single-digit lows of the 1970s
and early 1980s.
   Similarly, dividend yields for stocks overall, in the area of
3.8 percent to 3.9 percent, are ``in the normal range and
neutral,'' as described by Norman Fosback in the investment
advisory letter Market Logic.
   A similar picture emerges from a comparison of stock prices
among the issues in Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index versus the
corresponding companies' book value, or theoretical worth if those
enterprises were to be liquidated and the proceeds distributed to
shareholders.
   By the reckoning of Michael Metz and Norman Weinger at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., the S&amp;P industrials recently traded at around
250 percent of book value, down from 285 percent in August 1987.
   ``Whether the market is now cheap or dear depends to some extent
on one's perspective and on comparisons with other assets,
including debt instruments,'' Metz and Weinger report.
   ``Valuations still aren't bargains by historical standards.
Mitigating this consideration, however, is the fact that the book
value of many companies is now more conservatively stated due to
the huge writeoffs of obsolete and underperforming assets in recent
years.''
   However attractive stocks' prices may have become, investors
showed little appetite for them in the past week. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials fell 55.44 to 2,564.11.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 3.36 to
174.15; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost 5.96 to 374.42, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 2.32 at 321.45.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 123.92 million shares a day,
against 115.74 million the week before.
   Market barometers at neutral levels provide a little something
for everyone, since forecasters can use them to support either a
bullish or a bearish case.
   They can also be cited as a reason to sit tight. Concludes
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in its weekly publication ``The Outlook'':
``Although we'd maintain sound long-term holdings, conditions
remain too unstable to justify bargain-hunting at this time.''

<HEAD>Oil Crisis Gives Natural Gas Industry Some Extra Momentum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As America feels increasing pangs from the
latest oil crisis, the natural gas industry sees an opportunity to
grow.
   Increased use of natural gas ``will keep us from sending the
money over to Saddam Hussein and other Arabs,'' contended Robert A.
Hefner III, a leading gas explorer from Oklahoma City.
   Supporters say natural gas is cheaper and cleaner, with a
plentiful supply in North America that's free of supply disruptions
caused by Mideast political strife. More than 90 percent of the gas
used in this country is produced domestically, with most of the
rest from Canada.
   While oil prices have shot up in chaotic trading since Iraq
invaded Kuwait, pushing up the cost of gasoline and home heating
oil, natural gas has moved up only in a predictable response to the
coming cold season.
   With oil trading above $30 per barrel, the cost of an equivalant
amount of natural gas, 6,000 cubic feet, is about $9.
   Natural gas now has about 24 percent of the energy market, and
the American Gas Association has its sights set on a 28 percent
market share by the year 2010.
   Uncertainty from the Iraqi invasion has prompted gas producers
to push themselves even harder lately through advertising and
lobbying.
   The AGA says some 20 new pipeline projects that now await
regulatory approval could quickly cut the need for foreign oil by
bringing more gas into three regions: the Northeast, Florida and
California. The industry says demand for gas in those areas is
greater than the current infrastructure can support.
   ``We could replace roughly 160,000 barrels a day within 60
days,'' said Michael German, senior vice president with AGA. ``We
could displace 480,000 barrels a day within a year. We could
displace 1.3 million barrels a day within five years.''
   Energy Secretary James Watkins told the Senate Energy Committee
on Thursday that the government would seek faster ways to cut
through the red tape.
   Watkins, however, offered more modest figures for the amount of
oil that could be replaced. He put the figure at 55,000 barrels per
day by 1991, 300,000 barrels by 1992 and 600,000 barrels by 1994.
   There is also strong opposition to some proposed pipelines by
local groups, who claim construction of the underground lines would
damage the environment. Some are also afraid of leaks and
accidents, although the industry claims transporting natural gas is
safer than moving other kinds of fuel.
   Automobiles present another frontier for natural gas. It can
power cars more cleanly and at about 70 cents per gallon, the
industry says, compared to prices of more than $1.25 lately for a
gallon of gasoline.
   But its limited use keeps startup costs high. At present,
natural gas is being tried mostly by motor fleets in the United
States, although some people envision the day when consumers will
drive natural gas cars that are filled up overnight by machines set
up in the garage.
   Hefner views natural gas as the logical successor to oil, the
same way oil replaced coal as the fuel driving the nation this
century. He would like to speed things along by imposing a $1 per
gallon tax on gasoline to force consumers to pay the entire cost of
their fuel.
   As he sees it, the government is propping up a dying oil
industry though such multibillion-dollar acts as the deployment of
troops to the Persian Gulf and the storage of crude in the U.S.
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   ``If the oil companies or the producers had to pay the bill to
ensure the free flow of oil, they couldn't pay the bill,'' Hefner
said.
   The AGA, however, is not ready to endorse a gasoline tax,
although its members would benefit.
   ``It at least targets oil, which is an imported product,''
German said.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank will loan
Argentina $1 billion in coming months to aid the country's economic
and social restructuring, a bank official said Friday.
   World Bank first vice president Moeen Qureshi said the loans
will help finance reforming Argentina's state sector, reorder
government relations with provinces and develop programs in the
housing, health and public education.
   ``We hope that in the next six months we can bring forward at
least some of these programs,'' Qureshi said. He did not specify
precisely how the $1 billion would be spent or when.
   President Carlos Menem's 14-month-old government is selling
state companies, paring public employment, curtailing subsidies,
hiking public service rates and shutting down money-losing public
banks.
   The government already has eliminated price and currency
exchange controls, partially deregulated the oil industry,
increased foreign currency reserves, narrowed the fiscal deficit
and proposed to reform the tax code and make the Central Bank
independent of the government.
   ``I think the turnaround they have made in the fiscal area is
quite impressive,'' Qureshi said.
   In the process, however, social services have declined markedly.
Schools operate sporadically because of boycotts by teachers
demanding higher pay. Public hospitals barely have enough funds for
food, let alone medicine.
   The austerity measures also have contributed to recession. Real
wages have shrunk and tens of thousands of people have been thrown
out of work, and are unlikely to find jobs in the private sector.
   Apart from the new $1 billion loan, Qureshi said the bank has
approved $4.4 billion in loans to Argentina since 1961, and
Argentina has repaid $1 billion. Another $1 billion has been
approved but not disbursed, he said, and Argentina is in the
process of repaying $2.4 billion.

<HEAD>Gold Advances on Mideast Tension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The gold market remains sensitive to developments in the Middle
East but to a lesser extent than in the early days of the conflict,
analysts said Friday after gold posted modest gains amid unsettling
news from the region.
   On other commodity markets Friday, crude oil futures rose;
grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were
mixed.
   Gold futures settled $2.20 to $2.30 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in September at
$385.10 a troy ounce; silver was 2.3 cents to 3 cents lower with
September at $4.75 a troy ounce.
   Gold rallied strongly at midday on news that American troops
fired a warning shot at an Iraqi tanker and then boarded it briefly
in the first instance of U.S. forces boarding an Iraqi ship.
   But the gains were quickly scaled back despite higher crude oil
and lower stock prices, two factors that have tended to support
gold during the 6-week-old conflict.
   Higher oil prices suggest the U.S. inflation level could rise,
prompting investors to buy gold as an inflation hedge.
   ``To a certain degree, gold is divorcing itself from the action
in crude,'' said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities said
gold had responded ``very tepidly'' to Friday's 69 cents-a-barrel
jump in crude oil prices.
   The Labor Department's report of a 1.3 percent rise in wholesale
prices last month provided little support to inflation-sensitive
gold, the analysts said, because the number was within
expectations.
   Savaiko said gold is near the top of its recent trading range,
which runs from about $370 to $390 an ounce, and some traders are
reluctant to buy until the market shows it has enough strength to
go above $390.
   He said gold also may have been held back by weakness in silver
prices, a function of abundant supplies, and by selling linked to
the expiration of October gold options.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil
settled 30 cents to 69 cents higher with October at $31.76 a
barrel; heating oil was .74 cent lower to .74 cent higher with
October at 82.79 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 3 cents
lower to .25 cent higher with October at 90.36 cents a gallon.
   Corn and wheat futures extended their losses on the Chicago
Board of Trade while most soybean futures advanced, mostly in a
continuing reaction to Wednesday's government crop report.
   The Agriculture Department report contained higher than expected
estimates of 1990 U.S. corn and wheat production and predicted the
nation's soybean stockpile would continue to dwindle.
   Joel Karlin, grains analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, said wheat futures also were pressured by Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter's pledge to oppose an increase in crop
set-aside acreage as a means of stemming a slide in wheat prices.
   Yeutter told a farmers group in Chicago that taking more crop
acreage out of production would ultimately make the United States
less competitive in the world market.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents to 4\ cents lower with September
at $2.57 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1} cents lower with September
at $2.32} a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent higher with
September at $1.07 a bushel; soybeans were } cent lower to 3{ cents
higher with September at $6.24{ a bushel.
   Pork futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
boosted by higher than expected cash hog prices. Cattle futures
ended mixed.
   Live cattle settled .23 cent lower to .35 cent higher with
October at 78.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .55
cent higher with September at 88.75 cents a pound; live hogs were
.30 cent to 1.25 cents higher with October at 51.87 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.43 cents to 1.65 cents higher with
February at 54.65 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Carl Icahn, usually associated with bidding wars
in takeover battles, won a bid of a different sort in an auction
for a division of Integrated Resources Inc.
   Icahn won an auction in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here for American
Property Investors, a real estate holding company of Integrated
Resources. The takeover strategist bid $44 million for the company,
topping a $43.5 million offer by investor Meshulam Riklis and other
bidders.
   The purchase of American Property Investors represents an
expansion into the real estate business for Icahn. He has other
real estate properties, including Bayswater Realty, taken over in
1979 after a proxy fight, but heretofore has been more involved in
corporate investment and takeover bids than real estate.
   ``We want to get into the real estate business in a large way,''
Icahn said in a telephone interview Friday. ``There might be a lot
of good investments at this point. Everyone is selling and it might
be a good time to buy.''
   American Property Investors is the general partner and 10
percent owner of American Real Estate Partners L.P., which owns
some 300 real estate properties.
   By buying the general partner, Icahn would have control over its
properties. However, if he were to sell the assets, the lion's
share of the proceeds - 90 percent - would go to other partners.
   The winning bid does not necessarily seal the deal. Icahn must
still provide details of how he will finance the purchase, and
Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard Buschman will consider objections to
the sale by another losing bidder, Oppenheimer &amp; Bigelow Income
Fund I.
   However, Integrated Chairman Stephen Weinroth said in an
interview Friday that Buschman told the parties ``he hasn't seen
any compelling theories to hold up the transaction.''
   The proceeds from the sale will go to Integrated, which is
undergoing reorganization after filing for Chapter 11 protection
from its creditors in February.
   Integrated sought bankruptcy court protection after some of its
creditors balked at restructuring more than $1.6 billion in debt.
   The company had tried to build a financial services empire with
about $800 million in junk-bond financing provided by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., but was unable to meet the high interest
payments due on the debt.
   Integrated's filing for bankruptcy court protection came within
hours of Drexel's parent seeking the same protection.
   Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines, is best known for
his takeover attempts, which included unsuccessful runs at Texaco
Inc. and USX Corp. In May, he lost a ballot at the USX annual
meeting calling on the steel and energy conglomerate to spin off
its U.S. Steel subsidiary.
   But Icahn did not indicate he was getting out of investing in
companies.
   ``I think there are some good corporate investments still,'' he
said Friday, but added, ``I think there are some very good real
estate investments.''

   Oil futures bobbed up above $32 a barrel Friday,
finishing a week of closes over $30, after Iraqi troops in Kuwait
raided the diplomatic compounds of France, Canada and Belgium and
briefly seized several consuls.
   At one point, light sweet crude hit $32.20 a barrel, just 15
cents shy of its all-time high of $32.35 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Traders were also responding to news that pipeline
capacity was being cut back in the North Sea and possibly in the
Soviet Union.
   Crude settled 69 cents higher at $31.76 per barrel for October
delivery, with other delivery months up across the board. Friday
marked oil's seventh straight close above $30 per barrel.
   ``Some people are still anticipating a pull back,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. ``But it still looks like we are forming a base.''
   Unleaded gasoline and home heating oil closed lower for near
months, which trader Ed Kevelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
attributed to adequate supplies of those products on the cash
market.
   Gasoline fell 3 cents to 90.36 cents per gallon for October
delivery, while heating oil fell .69 cent to 82.79 cents per gallon
for October delivery. Prices were higher for more distant months.
   Natural gas for October fell to $1.52 per 1,000 cubic feet, from
$1.54 on Thursday. Other natural gas prices were mixed.
   The oil markets intially shot up Friday morning on news that
Iraqi troops had stormed into the French ambassador's home in
Kuwait, capturing the French military attache and three other
French citizens.
   ``It was the first time Bagdad's occupying forces have seized
anybody in a raid on the diplomatic community,'' said Brian Tagler,
a Shearson broker.
   The military attache was later released, and although the fates
of the other Frenchmen were not immediately known, the markets were
calmed when President Bush said the tense situation did not appear
to be moving any closer to armed conflict.
   Later in the day, crude moved back up on news that a Soviet
pipeline might cut its capacity, Hittle said. Earlier, prices had
been buoyed by news that a North Sea pipeline was cutting capacity
by 15 percent.
   Kevelson said the rise in crude prices was also attributable in
part to indications that the Saudis might be cutting back on their
production of sweet crude. Sweet crude, with a low sulfur content,
is best suited to U.S. refineries.
   ``You're stetting up for possible sweet crude shortages in the
future,'' Kevelson said.
   Oil's record high of $32.35 on the Merc was set Aug. 2, 1983,
and matched during the latest Persian Gulf crisis on Aug. 23.

<TEXT>
   Treasury bond prices fell Friday as the market
digested a mixture of good and bad news on interest rates and the
economy, sending a key rate above 9 percent.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 19-32 point, or $5.94
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to the
price, rose to 9.02 percent from 8.96 percent late Thursday.
   The 30-year, or ``long bond'' rate is an important economic
indicator used to calculate some mortgage rates.
   In a report on inflation, which is the greatest concern of
bondholders, the government said its producer price index rose 1.3
percent last month, a steep jump but in line with Wall Street's
expectations.
   In other economic reports for August, the Federal Reserve said
industrial production fell 0.2 percent and retail sales declined
0.6 percent.
   Both figures were poorer than economists expected, but are good
for bonds, since signs of increasing economic trouble could prompt
the Fed to ease interest rates. Lower rates benefit fixed-return
investments such as bonds.
   Gib Clark, chief trader at Daiwa Securities Inc. in New York,
said the bond market expects Fed easing is imminent.
   Meanwhile, signs of increasing tension in the Mideast sent oil
prices higher. Crude for October delivery rose 69 cents a barrel to
$31.76 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Increasing oil prices are a worry to bond investors because of
their effect on inflation.
   Another negative for bonds was the rise in interest rates
abroad, which makes U.S. investments less attractive, Clark said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell 1-32 point to 3-32 point, intermediate maturities
lost \ point to &rsqb; point, and long-term issues fell as much as 19-32
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.71 to 1,142.95.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 7.58
percent as the discount remained at 7.35 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 7.63 percent as the discount fell 1 basis
point to 7.26 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.70
percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.20 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 7} percent, down from 7~
percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell &lsqb; point to 89 25-32. The average yield
to maturity rose to 7.59 percent from 7.58 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Former Heileman Official Charged With Taking Kickbacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men were indicted for allegedly defrauding
the G. Heileman Brewing Co. of hundreds of thousands of dollars in
payments to a nonprofit sports marketing group in Chicago.
   The federal indictment names Joseph Monreal, 46, a former
director of advertising and special events in Hispanic markets for
Heileman, and Carlos Quintanilla, 32, a former executive director
of now-defunct Operation Search.
   Monreal was accused of taking $135,090 in kickbacks from
payments to affiliate the La Crosse, Wis.-based brewery with
sporting events and other activities run by Operation Search
between September 1983 and June 1987.
   Monreal was charged with three counts of mail fraud and
interstate transportation of money taken by fraud, while
Quintanilla was named in four counts. Both men pleaded innocent
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago.
   A third person involved in the alleged scheme was mentioned but
not named in the indictment, which was returned by a grand jury
last week.
   Monreal is a former president of the Milwaukee Hispanic Chamber
of Commerce. He was named Hispanic Person of the Year in 1985 by
the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Wisconsin.
   According to the indictment, Operation Search received $341,204
from Heileman after Monreal, Quintanilla and the third person
created and submitted false and inflated requests for funding from
the brewing company.
   It also charges that $10,090 was paid to each of two other
agencies after the defendants forged signatures of officials of
those agencies.
   According to the indictment, the defendants arranged for
Heileman to sponsor a city softball competition that never took
place and the purchase of $70,000 worth of baseball uniforms and
equipment.

   A federal judge Friday refused to grant an
Italian company's request to block a Chicago Board of Trade hearing
on the company's alleged manipulation of the soybean futures
market.
   U.S. District Judge James Zagel's decision allows the Board of
Trade to go ahead with a disciplinary hearing Monday on whether to
ban the Ferruzzi Group from trading on the exchange.
   The company is accused of trying to corner the soybean futures
market in July 1989.
   Ferruzzi said in asking the court to block the hearing that the
exchange had a financial stake in finding the company at fault.
   A $30 million lawsuit filed by Ferruzzi seeking damages against
the Board of Trade is still peding. That suit accuses the exchange
of manipulating the market and conspiring to force prices lower
when it issued an order forcing Ferruzzi to liquidate most of its
soybean holdings.
   The Board of Trade could decide to fine Ferruzzi instead of
banning the firm from trading on the exchange, said spokesman Mark
Proust.

   USAir and American Airlines on Friday
announced a 4.2 percent fare increase for domestic flights
effective Oct. 1, blaming the increase in higher fuel prices from
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   With the announcements, the airlines join a growing group of
carriers to impose a second increase in fares since Iraq invaded
Kuwait. Delta Air Lines on Thursday announced a 4.2 percent
increase, while Pan American World Airways and Alaska Air have also
announced fare hikes, most to take effect Oct. 1.
   The increase comes on top of a 5.3 percent increase that nearly
all domestic airlines imposed Aug. 30, due to higher jet fuel
costs.
   USAir said the cost of jet fuel has periodically risen more than
30 cents per gallon above the average price of 58.5 cents per
gallon in the second quarter of this year.
   Each 1 cent increase in fuel costs translates to $13 million in
annual costs for the carrier, the company said.

   Retail sales dropped 0.6 percent in August,

it was still interested in acquiring the Chicago-based airline.
   The disclosure, which came after the markets had closed Friday,
ended an agreement between UEAC and Condor Partners LP in April to

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate cleared the way for action on a
bill that would require automakers to dramatically increase fuel
economy.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Friday he
hoped to have a vote late next week on the bill that would require
automakers to increase average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles
per gallon by 1995 and to 40 mpg by 2001.
   Supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements would
save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day once they are fully in

the government is considering ways to renegotiate some of the sale

<HEAD>Greyhound Asks Bankruptcy Judge To Negate Union Back Pay Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking bus drivers shouldn't benefit from a
bankruptcy they caused, Greyhound Lines Inc. claimed Friday in
asking a bankruptcy judge to move the union to the bottom of its
list of creditors.
   In a complaint filed as part of its bankruptcy case, Greyhound
attacked a multimillion-dollar claim for back pay sought by members
of the Amalgamated Transit Union who went on strike March 2.
   Greyhound does not believe it will have to pay the strikers
anything. But the carrier said Friday that if it does end up
paying, the union members should have to get in line after the
other creditors.
   ``The strike has injured the creditors of Greyhound and to that
effect - because the tactics used by the union were violence, which
is illegal - those tactics should not be able to benefit the union
members ahead of the creditors,'' said Rosemary M. Collyer, an
attorney for the company.
   The union has attempted to devalue Greyhound to the point it
could buy the only nationwide intercity bus company, said Collyer,
former general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board.
   The ATU will oppose Greyhound's complaint as it presses ahead
with efforts to collect the back pay. ATU general counsel Earle
Putnam said the back pay has been accumulating at between $2
million and $3 million a week since May 27, five days after the
drivers offered to return to work.
   Greyhound has been operating with replacement drivers and union
members who crossed the picket line. The company said that even if
it loses, the back pay probably would not come to more than $8
million, based on a study of recent NLRB awards.
   Greyhound's complaint, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Corpus
Christi, is a move to erase the largest uncertainty it now faces.
   The company, which hopes to emerge from bankruptcy by mid-1991,
has until Oct. 2 to file a reorganization plan, but has asked for
an extension until Nov. 19.
   The size of the potential back pay claim has made devising a
reorganization plan more difficult, so Greyhound's latest move
attempts to negate and minimize it.
   An administrative law judge on Nov. 19 plans to hear testimony
on an NLRB unfair labor practices charge that says Greyhound
improperly hired replacements after the 6,300 bus drivers went on
strike. If Greyhound loses that case, it could be liable for the
back pay.
   Greyhound filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors on June 4, after failing to meet debt payments. Company
spokesman George Gravley said the strike has cost Greyhound more
than $50 million.
   Friday's filing by Greyhound accused the union of plotting to
get in line ahead of other creditors.
   ``That's ludicrous on its face,'' Putnam said.
   Greyhound's complaint, and other documents compiled by the
company, claim the union planned as early as last fall to drive the
company into bankruptcy.
   ``Between Nov. 2, 1989 and March 1, 1990, the union ... planned
and advocated a violent strike. ... to achieve the acquisition of
Greyhound by the union. ... (or) to drive Greyhound into bankruptcy
in order to obtain increased pay and other benefits ... at the
expense of other creditors.''
   The company has compiled a ``white paper'' and videotape on
strike violence, using information uncovered in gathering evidence
for a $30 million racketeering lawsuit filed in Florida against the
union and some of its leaders.

<HEAD>Philips Reportedly Planning Pullout From Project With AT&amp;T</HEAD>

   The Dutch electronics giant N.V.
Philips refused to comment Friday on a report that it was pulling
out of a multimillion-dollar telecommunications project with AT&amp;T.
   Het Financieele Dagblad, an authoritative Dutch business
newspaper, said Philips is planning to sell its 15 percent stake in
AT&amp;T Network Systems International, which develops and manufactures
public telephone exchanges.
   A Philips spokesman refused to comment on the report, saying the
company would make an announcement only if and when it saw fit. An
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. spokesman in the United States,
Tom Harris, also said he had no comment on the report.
   The newspaper added that Philips would limit itself after the
pullout to making only industrial telecommunications equipment,
including corporate switchboards.
   Philips' share in the project with AT&amp;T was estimated by the
newspaper at $100 million. That would place the total worth of the
joint venture at $666 million.
   The report said AT&amp;T would absorb 9 percent of Philips' share,
while 6 percent would be taken over by Telefonica SA, a Spanish
telecommunications company.
   But Harris, the AT&amp;T spokesman, said that report was incorrect.
Though Telefonica announced Friday it was buying a 6 percent stake
in AT&amp;T Network Systems International, he said that stake came out
of AT&amp;T's share in the venture.
   After the Telefonica transaction, AT&amp;T will own 59 percent of
the venture, down from 65 percent, Harris said.
   Italy's state-controlled STET owns the other 15 percent.
   AT&amp;T NSI, the U.S. company's main European operation, produces
software and hardware products for most of Europe's public
telecommunications networks.
   At a special shareholders meeting in July, Philips announced it
was beginning a major restructuring to streamline its operations.
   The announcement followed unexpectedly low first-quarter profit
of $3.4 million, down from $126 million in the first quarter last
year.
   Philips President Jan Timmer warned at the meeting to expect
more than $1 billion in losses and up to 10,000 layoffs.
   Timmer was appointed last May in a widely publicized boardroom
reshuffle and is reputed to be a ruthless cost-cutter.
   Philips, which began as a small light bulb factory, has grown to
be one of the world's biggest manufacturers of consumer
electronics, computers and other appliances, but has been facing
fierce competition from Japanese companies.
   Meanwhile Friday, Telefonica said it had reached an agreement to
take the 6 percent stake in AT&amp;T NSI in exchange for its 20 percent
share in a Spanish microchip company.
   In a joint statement, state-controlled Telefonica said it was
swapping its 20 percent share in AT&amp;T Microelectronica SA for the
stake in Netherlands-based AT&amp;T NSI.
   AT&amp;T NSI will now own 100 percent of AT&amp;T Microelectronica,
which in 1985 built a $200 million custom microchip factory just
north of Madrid.
   Telefonica President Candido Velazquez called the accord ``an
important step in the growing process of internationalization of
Telefonica, permitting us to directly participate in a European
project like ATT NSI.''
   AT&amp;T President Robert Allen said the agreement ``permits us to
widen our European perspectives and strengthen our position as a
global company.''
   Earlier Friday, AT&amp;T Network Systems Espana presented a new,
$100 million factory, which will provide 250,000 telephone lines to
Telefonica through 1990 and 300,000 lines in 1991.

<HEAD>Canadian Government Announces Oil Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Work on the Hibernia oil project
off Newfoundland will start almost immediately, now that a formal
deal has been struck to build the $5.2 billion ($4.5 billion U.S.)
project, federal Energy Minister Jake Epp said Friday.
   ``This day has been a long time coming but few will have reason
to doubt that it has been well worth the wait,'' Epp told a news
conference. ``Today, a major milestone has been reached. Hibernia
will bring jobs and economic diversification to Newfoundland and
all of Canada.''
   Companies estimate the Hibernia field has recoverable oil
reserves of 525 million to 650 million barrels. Peak output will be
about 110,000 barrels a day.
   The deal involving Ottawa, the province and a consortium of four
companies led by Mobil Oil Canada is to be signed when the House of
Commons resumes Sept. 24.
   A bill authorizing Ottawa's contribution of $2.7 billion ($2.3
billion U.S.) for Canada's largest oil project cannot be passed
until then.
   The rest of the costs will be covered by the consortium and
Newfoundland, which will also provide tax breaks during six years
of construction.
   The project will create up to 6,000 jobs during contruction and
about 1,100 during production.
   Mobil kicked off the project Friday by announcing the St.
John's-based company Nodeco will construct the gigantic concrete
underwater base that will hold up the rig platform about 190 miles
southeast of St. John's.
   About $3 billion ($2.6 billion) worth of construction work will
go to Canadian firms.
   Epp insisted the project - slated to start production in 1996
and last about 20 years - will be profitable, although some oil
analysts doubt that claim.
   A senior Energy Department offical said Ottawa and Newfoundland
each stand to make about $3.7 billion ($3.1 billion U.S.) if the
price of oil averages $30 U.S. in current dollars over the life of
production.

<HEAD>UAL Employees Split with Investor Group in Airline Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Airlines workers group announced
Friday they were ending an agreement with an investment partnership
to acquire the carrier's parent, UAL Corp.
   But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
worker group, United Employment Acquisition Corp., said it was
still interested in acquiring the Chicago-based airline.
   ``In light of current market conditions and in order to maximize
the flexibility of UEAC to pursue any appropriate transaction for
the acquisition of UAL, UEAC and Condor Partners L.P. entered into
the termination agreement dated as of Sept. 13, 1990,'' the filing
stated.
   The disclosure, which came after the markets closed Friday,
ended an agreement between UEAC and Condor, an affiliate of
Coniston Partners, to help UEAC, a company formed by United's
unions, acquire UAL. Coniston Partners is the largest shareholder
of UAL.
   Last October, news of the collapse of an employee-management
leveraged buyout of UAL prompted a 190-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
   Officials at United Airlines refused to comment on Friday's
announcement by the employee group.
   A representative at Coniston Partners called the move a
``non-event'' and a ``tactical move.'' They refused to comment
further.
