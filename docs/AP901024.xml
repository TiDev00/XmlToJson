   A judge who admitted being married to two
women at the same time was suspended Wednesday by the Oregon
Supreme Court.
   Multnomah County District Judge Robert Kirkman will be suspended
with pay effective Monday pending a final decision by the court.
   The Supreme Court action came after the Oregon Judicial Fitness
Commission unanimously recommended he be removed from office for
``premeditated and calculating criminal misconduct.''
   During the commission's disciplinary hearing in September,
Kirkman, 47, admitted he was married to two women at the same time.
He also admitted he had shown his second wife a forged divorce
decree before he married her.
   Kirkman showed Jane Kingsbury, his second wife, the forged
divorce decree in 1984. They were married in April 1987 by
Kirkman's boss, Judge Donald Londer.
   Later that year, the marriage was annulled after Kingsbury
learned that Kirkman was still married to his first wife, Sue.
   ``It was not very smart going through the ceremony and it was
not very smart to ask Judge Londer to perform the ceremony,''
Kirkman admitted in September.
   Kirkman and Kingsbury remarried the following January, shortly
after his divorce from his first wife was final.
   Based on Kirkman's admissions, the commission found that he
forged a court document, that he falsely represented on a marriage
license that he was divorced and that he remarried while still
married to his first wife.
   ``To his credit, Judge Kirkman admitted that he knew his
behavior was wrong and illegal when he committed it,'' the
commission found.
   The Supreme Court said a hearing to make a final ruling probably
will be held in Januay. Possible sanctions range from reprimand to
removal from office. The commission's findings are only advisory to
the Supreme Court.
   ``Judge Kirkman has conducted his personal life in a way that
has brought discredit and dishonor both to himself and to the
judicial system,'' the Judicial Fitness Commission said.
   Kirkman's attorney said he would ask the Supreme Court for a
lesser penalty.
   ``Naturally, we are quite disappointed,'' said Garr M. King, who
represented Kirkman at the commission hearing.

   Suspended Navajo chairman Peter
MacDonald, convicted last week of bribery, was disqualified
Wednesday as a candidate for tribal president.
   The Navajo Board of Election Supervisors decision can be
appealed, said officials of the nation's largest Indian tribe.
   Interim President Leonard Haskie automatically replaces
MacDonald on the presidential ballot. Haskie finished third in a
primary election, behind MacDonald and former Chairman Peterson
Zah. The election is Nov. 6.
   MacDonald was convicted Oct. 17 of bribery, conspiracy and
ethics violation charges. He was accused of taking gifts and money
from businessmen who dealt with the tribe.
   He was sentenced Monday to nearly six years in jail and fined
$11,000.
   Tribal law bars people convicted of ethics violations from
holding office for four years.

<TEXT>
   Grounded four months by hydrogen
leaks, Atlantis has been declared fit to fly and is being readied
for a secret mission to put a satellite in orbit, reportedly to spy
on Iraq.
   NASA found the shuttle free of dangerous leaks during a fueling
test Wednesday and almost immediately began working toward a Nov. 9
or 10 launch.
   ``Frankly, we expected the system to be tight. We put a lot of
work into it,'' said NASA Deputy Administrator J.R. Thompson.
``We're looking forward to a good launch.''
   It was welcome news for the space agency, which has come under
fire in the past half-year because of shuttle trouble, the Hubble
Space Telescope's flawed mirror and communication problems with the
Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft.
   Atlantis' military mission, the fifth shuttle flight this year,
will carry five astronauts and a satellite that civilian experts
said will spy on Iraqi forces. The mission originally was scheduled
for July but was delayed by leaks discovered in June.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said small amounts of hydrogen escaped
during the test into Atlantis' engine compartment and around a
17-inch-diameter valve between the orbiter and external tank, the
site of earlier problems. But he said the leaks were well within
allowable limits.
   NASA had replaced Atlantis' external tank, some fuel lines and
seals in the valve to try to stop the leaks.
   ``It's always nice to have a successful test under your belt,''
Sieck said. ``That just leaves one more to go, and that's Columbia.
We think we've got that one.''
   Columbia, grounded by hydrogen leaks since May, will undergo a
more extensive fueling test next week. Nearly a dozen TV cameras
will be mounted in the engine compartment to help track any leaks.
   Columbia could lift off with the Astro observatory as early as
December if the shuttle passes the test, Sieck said. Since the last
launch attempt, workers have replaced a crushed seal and tightened
joints.
   ``I hope we can get two more off this year. I believe we can,''
Thompson said. ``If we can accomplish all that, as you look back on
it I think it would have been a good year.''
   NASA stopped trying to launch Columbia after four tries and
instead got Discovery up on Oct. 6 with a satellite that will study
the sun's poles.
   Discovery's mission ended a 5{-month grounding of the fleet, the
second longest in shuttle history.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The street kids of Lima are called
``piranhas,'' for the Amazon fish that can strip a swimmer of flesh
in minutes. They swarm over victims in packs, snatching wallets,
purses and jewelry.
   Freddy lives in University Park, downtown Lima. His clothes are
torn and dirty. He has a long, deep, red cut on his right ear, but
no open sores on his face like some of the others.
   He is 11 years old. Like the other kids, Freddy sniffs glue to
get high or quiet his hunger.
   Hundreds of children roam the garbage-filled streets of Lima,
willing even to sell their bodies for enough to buy some food and
glue. Without help, most probably will die soon or end up in Peru's
infamous prisons.
   ``Many of the kids have venereal disease, some have AIDS and all
of them have some kind of skin infection,'' said Dwight Ordonez,
head of a project called Ninos de La Calle (Street Kids) that is
trying to help.
   Peru is in its worst economic crisis and thousands of children
hustle a living on the streets of Lima, a city of 7 million.
   Children of 5 or 6 hawk cigarettes, shine shoes or wash cars.
Most go home at night, even if home is only a shack.
   For the hundreds of ``piranhas'' there is no home. They live in
parks, plazas, on the river bank behind the Government Palace.
   Packs of them roam La Parada, a huge food market frequented by
drug dealers and prostitutes, and Kennedy Park in Miraflores, a
district of nightclubs and luxury shops.
   The city operates five youth shelters, there are several
orphanages and the police have two juvenile detention centers, but
the number of children on the street indicates the old system
doesn't work.
   Ninos de La Calle is part of the private, U.S.-financed Center
of Information and Education for the Prevention of Drug Abuse. It
takes a different approach because ``we are convinced the normal
way of working with street kids fails,'' said Ordonez, 30, who has
a master's degree in psychology.
   He said the traditional way is to confine the children, beat
them and impose overly strict rules.
   Ordonez said Ninos de La Calle homes are like ponds next to a
river, where the piranhas can swim in, stay awhile and swim out.
House rules are fairly simple: No stealing, fighting, breaking
things, drugs or sex.
   Ninos de La Calle has two homes and is building a third. About
55 boys have continuing contact with the group.
   The project was born in June 1989. Ordonez and other team
members spent three months in the streets studying homeless
children, and were horrified by what they saw.
   Lima's street kids, all boys and aged 10 to 16, run in
loose-knit gangs of 30 to 50, Ordonez said. All sniff glue, he
said, and about 10 percent smoke ``pasta basica,'' semi-processed
coca leaf from Peru's Amazon jungle.
   Project workers won the confidence of the boys, who generally
are aggressive and anti-social, by organizing soccer games.
   Once exposed to the homes set up by Ninos de La Calle, many
decided to stay. They even chased away other piranhas who tried to
lure them back onto the street with promises of drugs.
   The homes' biggest attraction seems to be a sense of belonging
to a group where someone cares.
   Ordonez said most of the boys were from poor families, but
divorce and abuse drove more of them into the streets than poverty.
   ``What they need more than anything else is to talk, but it's
what they do least,'' said Eduardo Villanueva, 29, a psychologist
who has been with the project since it began.
   One of Villanueva's boys at Miraflores house is Carlos, a lanky
16-year-old with a shy smile. When they first met, Villanueva said,
Carlos was always high on glue and had trouble speaking.
   ``When I was sick, they helped me,'' Carlos said of Ninos de La
Calle. ``When I wanted to leave, they invited me to stay.''
   After two months at Miraflores, Carlos has begun attending a
nearby public school, where he is about five years behind other
boys of his age. He said he wants to learn accounting and work in a
bank.

   Alicia Crews is a black Republican, but not for
long. President Bush's veto of a civil rights bill was the last
straw for her.
   ``It was a very needed bill,'' said Ms. Crews, who has been a
GOP voter for nine years. She plans to change her affiliation to
the Democrats.
   What was the message of the veto to her? ``That there isn't a
visible slavery but there's still a mental slavery,'' Ms. Crews,
31, said as she headed home from work here Tuesday, briefcase in
hand.
   A sampling of black voters around the nation found some
defending Bush's decision to kill the legislation that he said
would impose racial hiring quotas. More often, however, they echoed
Ms. Crews' disappointment or said blacks would take their anger at
Bush to the polls.
   ``He's lost all the black vote,'' said Mike Ward, who works at a
cabinet-making business on Atlanta's Martin Luther King Drive.
   Ward had been undecided in Georgia's upcoming gubernatorial
election but now he's inclined to vote Democratic.
   Heavy black turnout helped Democrats win midterm congressional
election victories when Ronald Reagan was president, and Bush's
veto may send more blacks to the polls Nov. 6, black observers
predicted.
   ``It's one of the many things that shows us that we must vote as
a group to show our support,'' Bernard George said at a Democratic
rally Tuesday night in New Bern, N.C.
   Cindy Turrentine, also at the rally, said she had mixed feelings
about the veto. ``There's a misconception that the civil rights
movement is there to set quotas,'' she said.
   Nonetheless, the veto will help galvanize the black community,
she said.
   ``I think our race in North Carolina will push them out even
more,'' Ms. Turrentine said. Her reference was to the U.S. Senate
contest between incumbent Republican Jesse Helms and Democrat
Harvey Gantt, who is black.
   Greater black turnout is likely elsewhere, too, because of the
veto, said Wayne Bryant, the majority leader of New Jersey's state
Assembly.
   ``Folks really do feel threatened,'' said Bryant, a black
Democrat. ``We fought these battles in the 1950s, and here we are
fighting them again just before the 21st century.''
   Paul Hubbard, president of New Detroit Inc., a coalition of
business and community leaders in the motor city, said he was
surprised Bush ``would have the nerve to veto something like that
in 1990, and I think voters will show their feelings at the
polls.''
   ``I think for the people on the fence, it would change their
mind. They would vote Democratic,'' added Hubbard, who is black.
   Sen. Eddie Bernice Johnson, one of the few blacks in the Texas
Legislature, agreed.
   ``I'm hoping that every minority affected by this bill, will
find it very important to go to the polls and vote their
conscience,'' said Ms. Johnson, a Democrat. ``I sure hope this will
send a message of political distaste to the entire (Republican)
party.''
   Bill Chappell, chairman of the Georgia Black Republican Council,
said he doubts the president's veto will have a major impact on
elections two weeks hence, though it could hurt the GOP among
blacks in the long term.
   ``I'm very disappointed that he vetoed the bill, understanding
all the implications and complications of it,'' Chappell said.
   Keith Butler, a black Detroit City Councilman who has met with
Bush to discuss civil rights legislation, doubted most blacks would
turn against the president.
   ``I think African Americans are going to remember that George
Bush has made more appointments of African Americans than any other
president,'' Butler said. ``The issue is not whether or not the
president wants a civil rights bill, because he's put forth one of
his own. It deals with methodology. ...
   ``I think Democrats want to find a way to embarrass him just
before the election,'' Butler said. ``I think the Democrats are not
acting in the interest of black people, they're acting in the
interest of getting votes for themselves.''
   Waiting at an Atlanta subway station the day after the Monday
veto, 22-year-old Air Force reservist Bryan Robinson said Bush's
action would not stop him from voting for Republicans in next
month's elections. ``I think there should be ways of keeping
discrimination out of the workplace, but I don't think ... quotas
are the answer.''
   Along the subway platform, other black riders were split.
   Many, like 50-year-old Franklin Harris, saw in Bush's veto an
erosion of the national commitment to civil rights. ``It's not just
for black. It's for white and all low-income people. That put a
hurt on all of us,'' he said.
   Henry Thornton, 20, said he'd continue voting for GOP
candidates. ``I'm not really into black vote, white vote. I look at
the platform,'' he said.
   Nell Harris, who has sometimes voted for Republicans in the
past, said now ``I'd think twice about it.''

   George Willig scaled them, tightroper Phillippe
Petit walked between them. Now, a promoter wants to send Michael
Andretti, Danny Sullivan and friends racing around the twin towers
of the World Trade Center.
   The vast office complex is the hub of the proposed New York 200,
a grand prix auto race that would be run on the notoriously bumpy
and congested streets of the financial district.
   ``At first blush, it sounds absurd,'' admits Matthew Scheckner,
director of the city's Sports Commission and an advocate of the
race. ``People are worried that Mario Andretti's going to be
shaking the orange juice out of their glass in the morning.''
   At second blush, it still sounds absurd.
   For three days in July a 1.3-mile course would be roped off
around the city's two tallest buildings. Streets where traffic
usually crawls - partly because there are so many potholes, partly
because there are so many vehicles - would be taken over by about
30 Indianapolis 500-class race cars moving at up to 220 mph.
   But earlier this month, enticed by the promoter's promise of
funds for neighborhood projects, a community planning board
endorsed the race, which has been run in recent years in New
Jersey's Meadowlands.
   The promoter, Frank Yodice of Motormarketing International,
admits it will take some work to convert the World Trade Center
into a racetrack. Streets must be graded and paved, safety walls
and fences installed, bleachers and pedestrian bridges erected.
   A pit area would be set up along the curb on Church Street, near
the start-finish line. The staging area where cars are parked would
be on the trade center's plaza - at the base of the 110-story
towers.
   Manhattan's community planning boards are notoriously resistant
to change, but Board No. 1 endorsed the race by a vote of 21-12.
The vote apparently was influenced by Yodice's promise of $350,000
for community projects - about $345,000 more than the board now
has.
   Board member Harold Donohue compared the majority's action to
``selling indulgences.''
   ``After they heard 350 grand, I think my colleagues would have
let them drop an atomic bomb down here.''
   Donohue says he voted against the race because of the
inconvenience it would cause, but that some board members viewed
the vote as ``a referendum on the internal combustion engine.''
   One is Patricia Dillon, who rides a bicycle to work and does not
even own a car.
   ``An auto race glorifies the automobile,'' she said. ``It's the
wrong signal to be sending with air pollution getting worse and a
war over oil about to start.''
   Scheckner, the sports commission director, just chuckles over
objections. ``You say auto racing in lower Manhattan, and people
say `No!' But we're not going to be running down Wall Street. These
are wide streets.''
   ``Races are held in Monte Carlo, Paris and Detroit,' he
continued, ``and Indy cars burn methanol, which is cleaner than
regular gasoline.''
   Benefits to the city, he adds, include a $36 million economic
infusion and ``leave behinds,'' such as newly paved streets.
   The streets are not all the race would polish, he added: ``This
is a time we could use a morale boost. And nothing makes New York
City look as good as sports on television.''
   The 200-mile race would be held on Sunday, with qualifying and
practice on Friday and Saturday. Downtown traffic is relatively
light on weekends in July, but on Friday, ``they'd be shutting down
the streets of the world's financial center,'' said Donohue.
   The race still must be approved by other city officials,
including the mayor, and Friday racing is expected to be a key
issue. Yodice says he hopes for a running next July, but may have
to settle for 1992.

   Peter Guertler, the owner of Vienna's
most famous hotel and former husband of one-time U.S. Ambassador
Helene Von Damm, has committed suicide, police say.
   Guertler, 44, shot himself to death in his hunting lodge
Wednesday in Pernitz, 30 miles south of Vienna, police said. They
did not say whether he had left a suicide note and they did not
provide further details.
   Ms. Von Damm was Guertler's second wife; they married while she
was ambassador in 1985 and she resigned a few months later, citing
an appearance of ``conflict of interest.''
   The couple was divorced less than two years later and Guertler
remarried.
   Guertler owned two top-class Vienna hotels including the Hotel
Sacher, famous for the Sacher Torte, the delicately flavored
chocolate cake the hotel began producing about 100 years ago.

<TEXT>
   The 24th division's ``Battle
Kings'' man 155mm howitzers, but the only weapons used in anger are
flyswatters. The enemy, for many, is a clock that moves too slowly.
   ``People keep telling lies that morale is high,'' said Spec.
Chris Hernandez of San Antonio, Texas, playing cards with friends
who nodded assent. ``They're only fooling themselves. Morale is
low.''
   A sampling of the 200,000 soldiers and Marines deployed under
Operation Desert Shield to confront Iraq suggests a classic
military malaise: Troops, with no idea of when new orders might
come, want to get back to their lives.
   Some have been in the blistering northeastern Saudi desert for
more than two months preparing for a battle that might never come.
   The desert weather is cooling down, but the sand remains,
fouling equipment, jamming weapons and fraying tempers.
   But many are still anxious to fight. Marine Sgt. Marco
Rodriguez, a 23-year-old aircraft mechanic from Santa Barbara,
Calif., left no doubt.
   ``I'll come home in one of two ways, the big parade or in a body
bag,'' he said. ``I prefer the former, but I'll take the latter.''
   Lack of enthusiasm, however, seemed more common.
   Field commanders like Lt. Col. Stephen Lutz, of the 3rd
Battalion, 41st Field Artillery - the Battle Kings - scrounge
videos, books, volleyballs and games to help their troops get by.
   ``We're thinking about this every day,'' Lutz said of growing
morale problems. ``We try to provide some relief and outlet for the
soldiers.''
   Sgts. Steve Coles, of Pittsburgh, Pa., and Ty McWhorter of
Wichita Falls, Texas, weren't convinced by the efforts. They spent
last Christmas in Panama on Operation Just Cause. This year, they
figure, they'll miss out again.
   ``All the goodies, we don't want them,'' Coles said. ``We only
want one thing: to go home. And that's speaking on behalf of
everyone.''
   McWhorter nodded gravely. His daughter was born 17 months ago,
just before desert training. Then came Panama and more desert
training. And then Saudi Arabia.
   Like most others, Coles and McWhorter acknowledged Desert Shield
was made up of volunteer service people. Like many others, however,
they said that if they weren't going to fight, they had no business
sitting around in the desert.
   Spec. Darnell Thompson of Akron, Ohio, said his daughter was
born in early October, and the news - from the Red Cross - took 10
days to reach him. He had been due for discharge soon but emergency
orders extended his stay for six months.
   ``We're not prisoners and shouldn't be held against our will,''
he said.
   Four soldiers playing cards broke in to condemn the long,
uncertain wait.
   William Curtis, 22, of Kelso, Wash., was barechested against the
heat, revealing a snarling tiger tattooed on his right shoulder. On
the left was a heart with the names of his three children. A fourth
child is due anytime.
   ``If my wife's going to read this, tell her I love her,'' he
said.
   ``My question is why are we here?'' said Spec. Anthony Zipperer
of Ruskin, Fla. ``Kuwait's such a little country. It's not a
democracy. If this isn't for oil, why are we fighting?''
   He laughed and added: ``I won't tell you what I really feel.
I've only said what I can get away with.''
   Another shouted: ``I don't see why I should fight for
constitutional rights that are denied to me.''
   The reporter, on an escorted tour, had to move on before he
could get an elaboration.
   Morale is a sensitive question. After grousing 24th Division
soldiers were quoted in the New York Times, the commanding general
restricted access to individual reporters.
   ``One man insulted the president,'' an information officer said
on condition of anonymity. He referred to a remark that President
Bush should come out and drink hot water with the troops to see
things up close.
   Such remarks, however, were common, not only in the 24th but
also among the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force and elsewhere among
the U.S. forces.
   Sgt. Christopher Paugh, 28, a Marine aircraft mechanic from
Philadelphia, wondered why troops couldn't have a cold beer.
Someone said U.S. forces had to be careful not to upset the Saudis,
for whom alcohol is forbidden by Islam.
   Paugh retorted: ``Hey, if they don't want us on their side, they
can fight their own damned holy wars on their own land by
themselves. We'll go home.''
   Senior army field officers blame the morale problem on
uncertainty. In Vietnam, a tour of duty was fixed at 13 months. In
Korea, troops had a calendar for marking off the days.
   Operation Desert Shield, deployed in haste after Iraq invaded
Kuwait Aug. 2, is undefined. Rumors fly: one-year tours, or six
months, or 18 months, or war any day.
   Some soldiers fault their comrades for grousing about a job they
volunteered for, with risks they agreed to take.
   ``It's part of the army,'' Lutz said. ``I was away when my son
was born, too. No one likes that part, but it is our job.''
   For the majority who grumble but do their best to adjust, small
comforts appear by the day.
   Marines of the 311 Combat Support Wing, based in Yuma, Ariz.,
built a weight room from scrap wood and iron. A poster pinned to
the camouflage netting reads: ``Body by Saudi.''
   On a jeep outside, a driver decorated his unneeded defroster
vent with a photo of his wife, an American flag and a Bart Simpson
doll.
   For Darin Gallow, 25, of Lake Charles, La., playing pickup
basketball by himself with a locket photo of Darin Jr. around his
neck, the luxury of letters from home makes the difference.
   Quiet plans are afoot for rest and recreation trips. Some men
and women take two-day breaks at a resort camp run by Aramco, the
giant U.S.-Saudi oil company.
   At the Battle Kings' club, the small library is limited. Among
the weighty tomes of military biographies and memoirs is a
well-thumbed paperback change of pace: ``Dante's Inferno.''

<HEAD>Death Machine Builder Charged With Being Fake Engineer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who builds execution machines for states
with the death penalty, already under fire for his views on the
Holocaust and questionable business tctics, now faces charges that
he is a fake as an engineer.
   Fred A. Leuchter Jr. was arraigned in Malden District Court
Tuesday on a charge of fraudulently practicing engineering. The
state Division of Registration made the charges after being
notified by a Jewish group that Leuchter holds only a bachelor's
degree in history from Boston University.
   Leuchter pleaded innocent. The case was continued to Dec. 11 and
Leuchter was released on his own recognizance.
   Leuchter, a resident of Malden, a northern suburb of Boston,
designs and builds death machinery for states that allow capital
punishment, including Tennessee, New Jersey, Delaware, Illinois and
Missouri.
   He drew fire after writing a report claiming that gas chambers
at some death camps couldn't have been used to kill hundreds of
thousands of prisoners. The report has been used as ammunition by
some anti-Semitic groups.
   The 192-page report stemmed from Leuchter's appearance as a paid
expert at the May 1988 trial of revisionist publisher Ernst Zundel
in Toronto. Zundel was charged and later convicted of knowingly
disseminating false information in his booklet, ``Did Six Million
Really Die?''
   As part of his defense, Zundel wanted scientific proof that the
gas chambers never existed. In ``The Leuchter Report: End of A
Myth,'' Leuchter said the gas chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and
Majdanek were technically incapable of the systematic gassing of
thousands of people.
   The report was reprinted in Europe, and Britain's House of
Commons condemned it as a ``fascist publication.''
   After business dealings with Leuchter, Alabama's assistant
attorney general in July sent a memo to all capital punishment
states questioning Leuchter's credentials and warning that his
views were ``unorthodox.''
   In the memo, Alabama Assistant Attorney General Ed Carnes
alleged that Leuchter would routinely offer his services as a
technical advisor to states conducting executions.
   If his offer was spurned, Leuchter would then offer to testify
on behalf of death penalty foes that the state's execution machines
would not work properly, Carnes said.
   ``What he has done is make money on both sides of the fence,''
said Carnes. ``I think Leuchter's neither a credible witness nor a
credible expert. I would never use him in a court of law again.''
   In a telephone interview from his home, Leuchter called Carnes'
charges ``lies'' and said he would take legal action against him.
He said Holocaust groups had pressured states to not do business
with him.
   ``The Jewish groups have effectively put me out of business,''
Leuchter said. ``They are doing the same things the Nazis did,
interfering with my right to free speech and to earn a living.''
   Leuchter said the state's engineering license requirements are
designed to protect the public from poorly constructed buildings
and do not apply to his work, since it is done out of state.
   While admitting he had only a history degree, Leuchter said he
had acquired the math and science skills necessary in college to be
an engineer.
   ``The bottom line is that anyone who goes to college has the
necessary math and science, which I do,'' Leuchter said. ``I've
worked as an engineer for 25 years. I'm not some Johnny come
lately.''
   Leuchter said he was not anti-Semitic and only meant to show
that gassings did not occur at the three camps he researched, not
that the Holocaust did not occur.
   ``These charges are ludicrous. Some of my best friends are
Jewish,'' Leuchter said, though he declined to name any.
   The state began investigating Leuchter last April after being
contacted by Holocaust Survivors and Friends in Pursuit of Justice,
based in Albany, N.Y.
   Shelly Shapiro, the group's director, said is ``dangerous
because he gives a scientific front to those who would deny the
Holocaust, he provides them with what they think is expertise on
gas chambers. We set out to show that he is no expert on gas
chambers and no engineer.''

<TEXT>
   Democrat John Durkin says Republican rival
Bob Smith is an ineffective three-term congressman who doesn't
belong in the Senate. ``Bumbling Bob,'' he calls him. The
``abominable no-man.''
   But Durkin, a former U.S. senator, will need more than his acid
wit to regain his place in Congress.
   Smith leads in the polls and has raised nearly $1 million, five
times the amount in Durkin's war chest.
   The conservative Smith says he is a proven performer in Congress
who represents New Hampshire's interests well. He led a successful
fight to defeat a proposed 50 percent congressional pay raise and
he favors a tightwad approach to federal spending.
   The candidates are vying for the seat being vacated by
Republican Gordon Humphrey, who decided to retire from Congress and
run for the state Senate.
   Durkin, 54, has lost ground in the polls since the Sept. 11
primary. He blames negative advertising by Smith portraying him as
a ``liberal big spender'' when he was a senator from 1975-80.
   ``I think people know I can be a pain,'' he says, ``but I do
stand up and try to take a stand.''
   ``Do they want a feisty mick who'll speak up or Bob Smith, who's
afraid?''
   His challenge is great in a state where the highest-ranking
Democrat is the state Senate minority leader.
   Smith has the backing of New Hampshire's Republican hierarchy
and the White House. President Bush attended a Smith fund-raiser
Tuesday in New Hampshire.
   Smith's advertising expenses this year - $200,000 - are more
than the $167,000 Durkin has spent on his entire campaign.
   He has seized on the abortion issue with a 30-second television
ad, telling Smith to ``keep your hands off the rights of my
daughters and the women of New Hampshire.''
   Smith opposes legal abortion unless the life of the mother is in
danger, but he has said he would support exceptions for rape and
incest victims if it meant enactment of federal anti-abortion
legislation.
   Durkin can beat Smith if he convinces undecided, pro-choice
voters to make abortion their decisive issue, says Dick Bennett,
president of the American Research Group polling firm in
Manchester.
   Two-thirds of New Hampshire's voters are pro-choice, according
to a private poll by the Becker Institute Inc., of Sudbury, Mass. A
poll by Bennett's company after the primary showed that Durkin led
Smith 2-1 among those favoring abortion rights.
   Durkin says his daughters convinced him to switch to pro-choice.
   Smith calls Durkin ``a flip-flopper'' on the issue who can't be
trusted.
   ``My pro-life stand is not a matter of convenience; it's a
matter of conscience,'' says Smith.
   Durkin also has tried to capitalize on the issue of campaign
contributions from political action committees.
   Durkin, who took PAC money in his losing 1980 Senate re-election
campaign, refuses to take it now and claims the system has changed
and corrupts politicians.
   He says Smith, who has raised half his money from PACs, has made
himself beholden to special interests.
   ``The charges are absolutely ridiculous,'' responds Smith.
   Smith also counters that Durkin takes money from the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, which receives PAC money.
   ``The issue here is not PAC money in general,'' Smith said.
``The issue here is the utter hypocrisy of taking PAC money and
saying you're not.''
   Durkin calls it ridiculous to compare the two kinds of
contributions.
   Durkin's attacks on Smith over PAC money include his taking
$1,000 from a player in the savings and loan scandal at the same
time Smith was calling for tougher penalties for violators.
   ``There's a real serious question here,'' Durkin said. ``Is it
corruption? Is it cynicism? Is it inattention to detail? ... Is it
stupidity? Any one of (them) render Bob Smith unfit for a six-year
term in the United States Senate.''

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Say Embargo Now Squeezing Iraqi Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. embargo against Iraq is beginning to
squeeze the Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait, but there is no
evidence of even a partial Iraqi withdrawal from the tiny emirate,
administration and military officials say.
   Pete Williams, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, said Tuesday that Iraq is making ``some adjustments'' to
its military operations in and around Kuwait as a result of the
embargo, which has been in effect since Aug. 6, four days after
Iraq invaded its neighbor.
   Williams said U.S. authorities believe the Iraqi military is
suffering shortages of tires and other materials. He cited Iraq's
recently imposed rationing of civilian supplies of gasoline as an
indication that the whole nation, including its military, is
threatened by the sanctions.
   ``As time goes by, the sanctions continue to have effect. It
becomes harder and harder to support that (military) force as the
embargo restricts the shipment of spare parts and supplies,''
Williams told a news briefing.
   Iraq has about 430,000 forces in Kuwait and southern Iraq,
bolstered by 3,500 tanks, the spokesman said. Those Pentagon
estimates have not changed for several weeks, but Williams said he
could not comment on whether Iraq's buildup appeared to be over.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told reporters in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that the Iraqi army
remains ``very solidly in Kuwait.'' He said he saw no evidence that
Iraq was moving forces away from the Saudi border.
   Williams said U.S. military authorities believe the Iraqi army
remains capable of quickly launching an offensive strike into Saudi
Arabia, even though it has spent more than two months digging in
and fortifying defensive positions.
   He indicated that Iraqi armored units are deployed behind a
shield of anti-tank ditches, earthen mounds and minefields designed
to stop an attack from Saudi soil.
   Williams also disclosed that the Pentagon was considering
starting a new wave of troop deployments to the Persian Gulf area.
Such a move would take Operation Desert Shield beyond the 240,000
personnel currently planned.
   Williams said more than 210,000 U.S. troops now are in and
around Saudi Arabia. That is 10,000 more than the last official
count issued by Cheney on Oct. 13.
   Williams said Powell was consulting in Saudi Arabia with U.S.
and Saudi officials on the possible need to expand Desert Shield
deployments, which President Bush ordered on Aug. 7.
   Powell will report his recommendations to Cheney after returning
to Washington on Thursday, Williams said.
   ``Then those decisions will be made on whether additional forces
need to be sent or not,'' Williams said. ``So I don't want to ...
signal that the deployment is nearly complete - that's a decision
that will be made in part this week by Gen. Powell's visit.''
   Powell was attending a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
meeting in Brussels today.
   Williams said it had been planned all along that U.S. troop
requirements in the gulf would be reassessed once the initial round
of deployments was nearing completion.
   U.S. ground forces in Saudi Arabia now include four Army
divisions, three Marine Corps expeditionary brigades, an air
defense artillery brigade, a mechanized infantry brigade and an
armored cavalry regiment. Also in the gulf area are more than 500
aircraft and 55 ships, including aircraft carriers and a
battleship.
   An Army source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
possible that Powell would recommend reducing the American force in
the region, depending on military estimates of Iraq's troop
strength and other factors.

   Three times in the last 18 months, astronauts
flew jets dangerously close to other airplanes and a government
agency says fatigue and outmoded NASA equipment were at fault.
   ``The three incidents that the safety board has investigated
could have been averted by a second crew member,'' said the
National Transportation Safety Board. ``The safety board therefore
believes that NASA should require an additional flight crew member
aboard all T-38A flights.''
   Astronauts, who are rated among the best pilots in the world,
use the high-performance T-38s for training and as transportation
to and from meetings and public appearances.
   ``Because the T-38A is a high-workload airplane, the safety
board believes that a type of short-term fatigue may develop, which
results in a decreased amount of attention available for all of the
tasks associated with controlling the airplane, navigating, and
communicating with air traffic control,'' the NTSB said.
   In the first incident, on May 15, 1989, shuttle commander David
M. Walker, a Navy captain, flew his plane within 100 feet
vertically and 700 feet horizontally of a Pan Am jetliner with 176
people on board. The distances were calculated by radar.
   The Pan Am crew ``could make out the tail number on the
airplane,'' Tim Borson, an NTSB investigator told the board members
at a hearing Tuesday.
   The airliner had just taken off from Dulles International
Airport en route to Paris and Walker was arriving in the Washington
area to be congratulated the next day by President Bush for
completing a successful shuttle mission.
   Although none of the NASA pilots was identified in the NTSB
report to NASA Administrator Richard Truly, Walker's involvement
was known. He was suspended from T-38 flights for 60 days in July
and replaced as commander of a space shuttle mission scheduled for
next year. The suspension has ended and Walker once again is in
line for a space flight, but probably not until at least 1992.
   Both NTSB and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said the system which encourages pilots to report near misses also
protects their privacy. The two unidentified flyers reported the
incidents involving them.
   The second of the near-collisions occurred on Sept. 17, 1989
over Texas, when a NASA pilot returning from Edwards Air Force Base
in California flew 2,000 feet below his assigned altitude and
``conflicted'' with a Piper Cheyenne, the NTSB said. Radar showed
one plane 1,400 feet above the other and three miles to the side.
The pilots did not see one another.
   On May 6, over Kentucky, a NASA jet was told to fly at 37,000
feet but apparently thought he was assigned to 27,000. As the T-38
descended, said NTSB, it came within 1,500 feet vertically and
three miles horizontally of an Eastern Airlines DC-9.
   Such separations are classed as near-misses because of the
speeds involved. At supersonic speed, aircraft can travel more than
1,100 feet a second.
   The safety board said the T-38's communications equipment was
``outdated and far from state-of-the-art.''
   Dan Brandenstein, chief of the astronaut corps, said in Houston
that ``we have realized the avionics have come a long way since the
T-38 was developed 30 years ago.'' He said one of the planes is
being modified with a view of upgrading the entire fleet.
   The NTSB recommended that the upgrading be accelerated and that
another flyer occupy the back seat in the two-seater aircraft to
aid the busy T-38 pilot. Brandenstein said ``we strive to make that
happen'' but that it isn't always possible.
   In all three cases investigated by the NTSB, the pilots were
flying below their assigned altitude when the near-miss incidents
occurred. NTSB said the T-38s lack the means to alert pilots when
they are out of their assigned altitude and that the pilots do not
write down their instructions as others do.
   The changes are needed, NTSB said in a letter to Truly, ``to
reduce the potential for human error.''
   Truly called the NTSB report ``thorough and constructive'' and
said NASA would consider all of the recommendations.
   There were two other incidents in 1989 and two in 1986, the NTSB
said without giving any detail.

   Deficit-reduction talks between the White
House and congressional leaders neared a crisis late Tuesday as
Democrats prepared to bring a budget to the House floor likely to
contain a tax-the-rich plan that Republicans oppose.
   Democrats said they hoped to keep budget negotiations alive. But
they were ready to force a vote on a $250-billion deficit-cutting
bill containing the controversial tax package as early as
Wednesday.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Minority
Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., met with President Bush at the White
House for nearly two hours Tuesday night to plan their next steps.
   ``They're going to talk about whether to blow these (budget
talks) all up,'' one Republican official who demanded anonymity
said before the session.
   Afterward, a spokeswoman for Michel said the meeting with Bush
was inconclusive.
   The potential blow-up raised the specter that Bush would allow
the government to shut down after midnight Wednesday night when
federal authority to spend money technically expires.
   Until now, the president had indicated that with continued
progress in the budget talks, he would sign yet another emergency
bill providing money for the government for a short period.
   Democrats, looking gloomy, huddled in the Capitol. Afterward,
they said they did not believe a major problem had cropped up in
the negotiations.
   ``We will try to keep negotiations going,'' said House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``But the hour is late
and we still don't have an agreement.''
   ``I do not view this as a crisis point,'' said House Speaker
Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   The problem arose as the two sides appeared to be nearing final
agreement on a $250-billion deficit-reduction measure that would
boost the gasoline tax by about a nickel, raise taxes on alcohol
and tobacco and cut Medicare spending and other benefit programs.
   The budget Democrats were preparing to bring to the House floor
seemed likely to contain a measure that would impose a 7.5 percent
surtax on millionaires.
   Republicans and Bush oppose that plan, which they fear would
allow Democrats to boast that the president dramatically increased
income tax rates.
   Instead, they prefer limiting deductions the wealthy may
itemize.
   But after a day of closed-door meetings, House Democratic
leaders proved unable to drum up support among rank-and-file
lawmakers for a compromise without a surtax that would limit
deductions for the wealthy.
   The two parties agree that in addition, the income-tax rate on
the wealthy would also be increased to 31 percent from its current
28 percent.
   The long-running fiscal struggle held center stage as the 101st
Congress labored to complete its work.
   But in the last days before national elections, other
politically charged issues neared a final vote:
   -The Senate delayed an attempt to override the president's veto
of a civil rights bill. The president claims the bill's anti-job
discrimination provisions would lead to hiring quotas.
   -A toughening of clean air laws was expected to go to a final
vote on Wednesday or Thursday.
   -A new spending bill was needed to keep the government in funds
after midnight Wednesday.
   Bush, campaigning in New England, wouldn't say whether he would
sign such a bill but put the blame for the situation on the
Democratic-controlled Congress. He said he was ``so frustrated by
Congress' inability to do anything ... I don't know what I'm going
to do.''
   Bush called on Republicans to put ``self-interest'' aside and
support a compromise budget. But at the Democratic caucus, many
legislators remained dissatisfied.
   ``We asked for a show of hands on support for the package and it
was right down the middle - 50-50,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ``That's not
good, not good at all.''
   Senate Democrats greeted the would-be budget compromise much
more warmly. After meeting with them, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said he expected a majority would support the
proposal.
   The proposed compromise Democratic leaders brought their members
Tuesday contained no surtax. Instead, it limited deductions for
people earning $100,000 by about 3 percent, and limited them even
further - by about 5 percent - for people earning $1 million
yearly.
   But just days after the House approved a budget that would put
heavy new taxes on the rich, many of the chamber's Democrats felt
the new plan didn't go far enough.
   ``More than half the people felt the tentative outline was too
great a retraction from what the House adopted, that the strong
flavor of progressivity would be heavily diluted,'' said Rep. Jim
Moody, D-Wis.
   Others seemed ready to compromise.
   ``Of all the alternatives on the table right now, none are worse
than nothing,'' said Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan.
   Democrats said the meeting proved that either more Republican
votes had to be found, or the plan would have to be changed to
Democrats' liking.
   Dole said late Tuesday that Republicans had offered to support
an alternative: phasing out the personal exemption for the
well-to-do. Currently, all but the wealthiest taxpayers are
entitled to the $2,050 exemption.
   Dole said another option was to simply drop the idea of limiting
deductions and forego the revenues that the proposal would raise.
Depending on how tightly deductions are limited, dropping the idea
completely could cost about $30 billion over five years.
   ``Then we could blame the Democrats for not getting the
savings,'' Dole said.
   No final decisions have been made on how deeply to cut Medicare
or how high to raise the gasoline tax. House Democrats said they
wanted Medicare reductions to be no more than about $43 billion
over the next five years, about $4 billion short of what
Republicans prefer.
   The gasoline tax increase seemed to be set at about 5 cents or 6
cents per gallon - it is now 9 cents.
   The two sides seemed willing to increase the wage cap below
which Medicare taxes are deducted to $125,000, up from its current
$51,300.
   The $250-billion budget-cutting bill is the keystone of a plan
to reduce red ink by $500 billion over the next five years. The
rest of the savings would come from defense cuts and
lower-than-expected interest payments on the federal debt.

<HEAD>State Drops Out of Missouri Right-to-Die Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL MANNING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Missouri has withdrawn
from the Nancy Cruzan right-to-die case, removing a major obstacle
to her parents' attempts to remove their comatose daughter's
feeding tube.
   The Health Department and the director of the state-run Missouri
Rehabilitation Center, where the 33-year-old woman lies, were
dropped from the case Tuesday upon the signing of an order by
Probate Judge Charles Teel.
   The request was made last month by Missouri Attorney General
William Webster.
   His office had fought the Cruzan family all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court, which in June blocked removal of the feeding tube in
its first right-to-die ruling.
   ``The legal questions previously raised by the state have been
answered by the Missouri and U.S. Supreme courts,'' Webster
spokeswoman Mary Jenkins said in explaining the state's withdrawal.
   The only other party to the case when Joe and Joyce Cruzan of
Centerville go to court Nov. 1 in another attempt to remove their
daughter's feeding tube will be Ms. Cruzan's court-appointed
guardian, Thad McCanse, and he previously sided with the family.
   Ms. Cruzan has been in a vegetative state at the rehabilitation
center since a 1983 car wreck. Her body is rigid, her hands and
feet bent into claws. She breathes on her own, and at times her
eyes are open and move randomly.
   In its ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court said Missouri could keep a
patient on life support in the absence of ``clear and convincing''
evidence the person would want to die.
   The Cruzans say they now have such evidence and will present it
at the hearing in front of Teel.
   In August, they told the judge that three people would testify
they talked with Ms. Cruzan about her wishes regarding
life-sustaining treatment. She left no written instructions about
what she would want done under such circumstances.
   Bill Colby, attorney for the Cruzans, said that despite the
state's exit, ``We still need to prove our case through clear and
convincing evidence. We still have an uphill battle. But I think we
have far more than clear and convincing evidence now.''
   Colby would not name the witnesses but said, ``They are all
people who worked with her. Two talked about the forced feeding of
severely handicapped children and the third talked at length about
the Quinlan case.''
   He was referring to the 1976 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling
that allowed Karen Ann Quinlan's family to remove her respirator.

   On the whole, President Bush clearly would
rather be back traveling to world capitals than pounding the
campaign trail in this time of high voter skepticism toward
incumbents. And soon he will be.
   Bush, already weakened by his wavering stands on taxes and the
budget deficit and facing the first resignation of a Cabinet
member, will crisscross the nation between now and Election Day
stumping for Republican candidates.
   He will visit at least 14 states, including Hawaii.
   But aides say the president - once a tireless campaigner - is
wearying of being battered daily on domestic issues and is looking
forward to the post-election period when he can once again focus
his energies on foreign policy.
   Even some of Bush's sternest critics on domestic policy have
complimented him for conducting foreign policy with a steady hand.
   And Bush, as he speaks at one GOP fund-raising event after
another, seems to come alive as he moves from gloomy accounts of
``the mess in Washington'' to speaking on the Persian Gulf.
   His voice rises, his sentences become crisper, and the applause
- often merely polite on budget declarations - becomes thunderous
and sustained as he rails against Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   ``When this ordeal is over ... Saddam must pay for the pain and
the hardship he has caused. The world will hold him accountable,
just as it held Adolf Hitler accountable in the wake of the
destruction of World War II,'' Bush said at a GOP fund-raiser in
Stamford, Conn., on Tuesday night. The line got him some of the
hardiest applause he had received in days.
   Bush plans a series of foreign trips beginning soon after the
mid-term elections - to Paris and other European capitals, to Saudi
Arabia to meet with U.S. troops, to Mexico and to five South
American countries. And all by the end of this year.
   And, early next year, a Far East trip is being seriously
discussed, maybe to Japan, and perhaps with stops in Australia on
the way.
   Bush's campaigning in rainy New England on Tuesday saw one of
those days that suggest much of the fun has gone from the campaign
trail for the veteran campaigner and onetime chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
   The president earlier had invited Republicans to ``blame me''
for unpopular election-year stands. And, by and large, they have.
   For instance:
   -At his first stop, in Burlington, Vt., the GOP congressional
candidate he was there to help get re-elected, Rep. Peter Smith,
told the audience at the outset that he didn't agree with Bush's
veto of a civil rights bill or his reluctance to tax the wealthy.
   -At his second stop, in Manchester, N.H., the candidate didn't
even show up. Rep. Bob Smith, who is running for the Senate,
couldn't break himself away from the budget and other pressing
business in Washington. Instead, his wife, Mary Jo, spoke in his
place.
   -At his third stop, a reception for GOP House candidate Gary
Franks in Waterbury, Conn., Bush found himself on the defensive at
a picture-taking session both on the budget and on his veto of the
civil rights act. Franks, who is black, supported Bush's veto, but
many other black Republicans do not.
   -At his fourth and final stop, a dinner for Connecticut GOP
gubernatorial candidate John Rowland in Stamford, Conn., the
candidate gave Bush backhanded praise, saluting him for ``making
tough decisions, every day, some good, some bad.''
   Meanwhile, back in Washington, reports circulated - and were not
denied by Bush or his aides - that Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole,
the administration's highest-ranking woman, was quitting.
   That only complicated the domestic scene for Bush.
   In Waterbury, he made his frustrations with the continuing
budget stalemate clear.
   Citing a ``raucous caucus on the Democratic side where they
couldn't agree on anything,'' he fumed, ``I don't know what's
happening down there.''
   Asked whether he would once again sign a stopgap spending bill
to keep government operating if no budget agreement is reached by
midnight tonight, the president was at a loss for words.
   In the past, he had vowed never to sign another such temporary
measure - only to sign one after the other.
   ``We'll have to wait and see what happens before I can make a
decision on what I'm going to do,'' Bush said. ``But I feel the
frustration that I think people all across this country feel about
Congress' inability to do anything.''

<HEAD>U.S. Plans Slow Withdrawal In Asia, But Argues Against Big Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets are withdrawing, Koreans and
Filipinos are protesting and costs in Japan are enormous. But the
United States says any reduction of its big troop presence in Asia
will be slow and limited.
   Critics accuse the Defense Department of looking for new threats
now that the Soviet Union has begun major pullouts of troops, ships
and aircraft east of the Ural Mountains.
   Backers of a strong U.S. force say it will prevent any country
from dominating the region and ensure that the world's richest
trade routes remain open.
   In February, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced a 10
percent cut in Asian-based troops over three years, and the latest
round of planned bases closings includes nine small facilities in
South Korea and one in Japan.
   A U.S. military spokesman in Hawaii, Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd, said
very few soldiers actually have been removed from Asia to date.
   ``We're still in the stage of deciding who's going to be
moved,'' he said.
   Cheney says the bulk of American forces will stay.
   ``I think our presence in the Western Pacific is in everybody's
interest,'' he said in a speech last month. ``It dampens down the
enthusiasm others might feel if, in fact, the United States wasn't
there in terms of their desire to move in and fill the vacuum.''
   The United States now has 50,000 military personnel in Japan,
44,400 in South Korea and 14,800 in the Philippines. An additional
25,800 are on ships of the Japan-based U.S. 7th Fleet.
   The main justification for a big U.S. presence in Asia has
shifted from one of defense against Soviet aggression to a role
that a Defense Department report describes as ``regional balancer,
honest broker and ultimate security guarantor.''
   Noting that cross-Pacific trade totals more than $300 billion a
year - 50 percent more than U.S.-European trade - the report says,
``It is in our own best interest to help preserve peace and
stability.''
   Other justifications include continued racial and ethnic
tensions, unresolved territorial disputes, advancing weapons
technology, continued arms sales and illegal drug trafficking.
   Critics say Asians can protect themselves.
   ``Since the Cold War is over and a Soviet invasion is no longer
credible, military officials in the U.S. have been scrambling to
find new enemies and threats to justify maintaining extensive
military forces in the Pacific,'' said a report by the private
Center for Defense Information.
   The center, led by retired senior military officers, long has
been critical of U.S. military buildups around the world. It issued
successive reports in recent months calling for U.S. troop
withdrawals from Japan, Korea and the Philippines.
   The key exception to official support of the U.S. presence among
America's Asian allies has emerged in the Philippines, where talks
are to resume next month over the two largest U.S. foreign bases,
Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base.
   President Corazon Aquino has called for an ``orderly
withdrawal'' of U.S. forces despite the thousands of jobs and
hundreds of millions of aid dollars linked to the bases. Philippine
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said his country wants to take
over Clark next year and also is seeking reductions at Subic.
   U.S. negotiator Richard Armitage said the era of a big U.S.
military presence is ending. But he spoke only of a phasedown, not
a phaseout.
   Even before the talks, the United States began looking for other
sites and has received an offer for more access to Singapore.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. goal is to get Japan to pay more of U.S.
forces' expenses and South Korea to both pay and assume a leading
role in its own defense over the next five to 10 years.
   Critics in South Korea, including student demonstrators, say the
U.S. military poses an obstacle to reunification with communist
North Korea.
   In contrast to the U.S. reluctance to withdraw, the Soviets are
cutting forces by 40 percent in Asia.
   U.S. officials confirm that Moscow is removing 50 ships from the
Pacific and withdrawing from the former U.S. base at Cam Ranh Bay,
Vietnam. Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Soviet facilities
``will be replaced by mosquitoes and grasshoppers.''
   Three Soviet air regiments already have been removed and 11 more
are scheduled to leave, a U.S. military report said.
   The report cautioned, however, that Soviet planes and armaments
are being modernized and bomber and strategic interceptor units
remain unaffected by the restructuring.

<HEAD>Synthetic Hormone to Stimulate Milk Output Debated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dairy farmers, processors and food chains are
being squeezed one way and then another by advocates and critics of
a synthetic hormone designed to boost a cow's milk production.
   At the center of the storm is bovine somatotropin, or BST, a
synthetic hormone that can boost milk production by 10 percent to
25 percent.
   The Food and Drug Administration next year is expected to
approve the chemical - also called BGH, or bovine growth hormone -
for commercial use.
   Critics of the hormone contend that it taints milk, harms cows
and threatens to open the floodgates to surplus production that
will depress prices and wash out thousands of struggling dairy
farmers.
   One of the severest BST critics has been Jeremy Rifkin of the
Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington-based advocacy group
that often is involved in consumer issues.
   Rifkin recently announced a national campaign to boycott BST and
those dairies, companies and grocery chains that don't go along
with the anti-hormone movement.
   The National Milk Producers Federation, which has not taken an
official position on the issue, is telling members about some of
the forces that will be at work in the coming months.
   ``With the tide of scientific evidence running against their
health safety arguments, BST foes have turned to picket and boycott
threats to achieve their goals,'' the federation's newsletter said
this week.
   The Rifkin plan includes letters to companies asking for support
for the BST boycott and urging them to sell only BST-free milk and
dairy products, even if the FDA gives the chemical a clean bill of
health.
   In December, the foundation plans to issue a ``pure milk
advisory'' newsletter that Rifkin said ``will identify those
companies that have pledged to accept and sell only pure and
natural'' milk free of the synthetic hormone.
   The advisory, he said, will include a list of companies that
intend to accept or sell milk from hormone-treated cows.
   ``Those companies will be subject to selective picketing and
boycotts by grassroots farm and consumer organizations in local
communities around the country,'' the foundation said.
   But the dairy federation said a number of farm and food
organizations have alerted members ``to the dangers of the coming
campaign'' over the hormone.
   ``The International Dairy Foods Association told members they
are under no obligation, legal or otherwise, to respond to the
(foundation) letter,'' the dairy newsletter said. ``The Dairy
Industry Coalition has also expressed its opposition to milk and
dairy products becoming a pawn in the biotechnology controversy.''
   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department says U.S. dairy production
is increasing and that surpluses are expected next year.
   ``In 1991, milk and dairy product prices will fall sharply from
a year earlier,'' according to a report this week by the
department's Economic Research Service. ``Significant surpluses of
both cream and skim milk are expected. Milk production is projected
to grow 1 percent to 2 percent next year, largely on the strength
of late-1989 and 1990 returns.''
   Overall, the agency said, the farm price of milk in 1991 is
expected to be down $2 to $3 from this year's average of around $14
per 100 pounds.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Veterinarians help farmers with their
livestock and city people with their pets, from lizards to ponies.
They also are important for the protection of the nation's food
supply, says Shelton Pinkerton, president of the American
Veterinary Medical Association.
   ``Many consumers are aware that veterinarians in private
clinical practice are involved in production agriculture, working
with farmers and ranchers to develop and maintain healthy,
well-nourished, properly housed, economically productive herds and
flocks,'' he said Tuesday.
   But what most people are unaware of is the work that
veterinarians do in the public sector, Pinkerton told the American
Association of Food Hygiene Veterinarians.
   ``The fact that most of the public is unaware of your role is
not because of ignorance on the part of the public, but rather
because of your skill and good work, which unfortunately results in
your being taken for granted,'' he said. ``We expect safe,
wholesome food, and we have safe, wholesome food.''
   Pinkerton said that one measure of the confidence and security
people have in the U.S. food supply is ``the level of media
attention that develops in those rare occasions when there is a
problem that affects the public.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Preliminary tests of cotton plants genetically
engineered to destructive insects have been encouraging, the
Agriculture Department says.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service this summer
conducted the first field tests of the cotton plants developed by
Monsanto Co. of St. Louis, the agency said Tuesday.
   Test plants, called transgenic, were inserted with a gene from a
different organism, Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, a commercially
available natural bacterium.
   The gene enables Bt to make a protein toxic to many caterpillar
species. And the transgenic plants make a similar protein.
   USDA scientists said the transgenic plants caused caterpillars
to have ``a fatal case of indigestion, often after eating only a
bite or two'' of the leaves or bolls.
   The engineered cotton plants still must undergo extensive
testing, but officials said the new technology could help reduce
the use of chemical pesticides, reducing production costs for
cotton farmers.

   British rock star Rod Stewart plans
to marry a 21-year-old New Zealand model, her parents said today.
   Rachel Hunter and Stewart, 45, will have an ``old-fashioned
church wedding'' in Los Angeles on Dec. 15, said her mother, Janine
Phillips. A reception will follow at Stewart's $7 million Los
Angeles mansion.
   Miss Hunter, who works for New York's Ford model agency, appears
on the cover of this month's Australian Vogue. She met Stewart in
August.
   Stewart has enjoyed success as a member of the band Faces and as
a solo performer. His hits include ``Maggie May,'' ``Hot Legs'' and
``If You Think I'm Sexy.''
   He dated actress Britt Ekland before marrying Alana Hamilton in
1979. They had two children before divorcing. Stewart separated
from model Kelly Emberg, with whom he has a 3-year-old daughter,

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Magician Doug Henning says he and Indian
guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi will build a $1 billion theme park,
practically in Walt Disney World's back yard, featuring magic and
Eastern-style meditation.
   The park will open in 1993 on 450 acres and offer 38 major
attractions focusing on the themes of knowledge, enlightenment and
entertainment, he said.
   It will include a courtyard of illusions and a building
apparently suspended above water.
   The park will be the flagship of similar parks in the
Netherlands, Brazil, Canada and Japan, Henning was quoted as
telling The Orlando Sentinel. The parks will be called Vedaland.
Veda is an Eastern term meaning knowledge, he said.
   The Maharishi has been credited with spreading transcendental
meditation worldwide. He oversees a conglomerate with assets of
about $3 billion.
   Rick C. Weberg, a director of Pepper-Weberg Trading and
Investment Corp. of Toronto, said his company is lining up
investors.

   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Get-well cards and letters to injured
Cincinnati Reds outfielder Eric Davis piled up, and flowers sent to
him were detoured to younger patients.
   Davis suffered a kidney injury in Saturday night's final game of
the World Series against the Oakland A's and was listed in stable
condition in the intensive care ward Tuesday. His doctor said he
probably would be released this week.
   ``We haven't been counting, but I can say the amount of mail has
been overwhelming,'' said Anna Runkle, marketing coordinator for
Merritt Peralta Hospital.
   Davis had requested that his flowers be sent to Childrens
Hospital in Oakland, Ms. Runkle said.
   Davis was injured in the first inning as he hit the ground
trying to make a diving catch. The Reds won the game 2-1 for a
four-game sweep of the World Series.

   TULSA, Okla. (AP) - Waylon Jennings has had fame and fortune as
a country singer. Now, with a high school equivalency diploma, he
says he has the edge.
   Jennings, who dropped out in the 10th grade, passed the exam in
December.
   ``Going back to get your high school diploma isn't the answer to
all your problems by any means, but I'll tell you what it is: It's
a psychological advantage,'' he said.
   ``It gives you that little bitty edge. It'll make you go through
a door that you wouldn't have gone through if you didn't have it,
because you knew that somebody on the other side of the door was
educated.''

   SAN FERNANDO, Calif. (AP) - A judge reduced a six-year prison
term for an obsessed fan who broke into actress Sharon Gless' home
armed with a rifle.
   The sentence for Joni Leigh Penn, 31, of Garden Grove, was
reduced to four years by Superior Court Judge John Major on
Tuesday.
   Major said Penn had no prior convictions, has been a model
prisoner and did not harm anyone during the incident March 30. The
judge also said Penn, originally sentenced July 16, was receiving
treatment for psychological problems.
   The incident ended after a seven-hour standoff with police. Miss
Gless was not home at the time.
   Penn has said she was in love with Gless, the Emmy-winning star
of ``Cagney and Lacey'' and ``The Trials of Rosie O'Neill.'' Penn
said she broke into the star's Studio City home to sexually assault
the actress and then commit suicide.

<BYLINE>Current Creed</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   I believe in the future of farming, with a faith born not of
words but of deeds - achievements won by the present and past
generations of agriculturalists; in the promise of better days
through better ways, even as the better things we now enjoy have
come to us from the struggles of former years.
   I believe that to live and work on a good farm, or be engaged in
other agricultural pursuit, is pleasant as well as challenging; for
I know the joys and discomforts of agricultural life and hold an
inborn fondness for those associations which, even in the hours of
discouragement, I cannot deny.
   I believe in leadership from ourselves and respect from others.
I believe in my own ability to work efficiently and think clearly,
with such knowledge and skill as I can secure, and in the ability
of progressive agriculturalists to serve our own and the public
interest in producing and marketing the product of our toil.
   I believe in less dependence on begging and more power in
bargaining; in the life abundant and enough honest wealth to help
make it so - for others as well as myself; in less need for charity
and more of it when needed; in being happy myself and playing
square with those whose happiness depends upon me.
   I believe that rural America can and will hold true to the best
traditions of our national life and that I can exert and influence
in my home and community which will stand solid for my part in that
inspiring task.

<TEXT>
   I believe in the future of agriculture. Ours is an industry rich
in tradition and ripe with promise. As farmers before me diligently
coaxed life from this land, I will dedicate myself to the tasks
before me. The legacy left to me is one of honor, and I shall
strive to preserve and strengthen the dignity of American
agriculture.
   I believe a career in agriculture is a worthy undertaking. In
choosing agriculture, I embrace a purposeful way of life based on
productive work, progressive thought, calculated risk and a
commitment to education. I welcome these challenges, for I know
such a life yields endless rewards.
   I believe I am responsible for the well-being of the earth. I
stand ready to make wise choices which will enhance life for my
fellow human beings and preserve the world's precious resources. I
accept eagerly this charge, for the future literally depends upon
me.
   I believe that building my self-esteem and developing my natural
talents are among the most valuable contributions I can make to my
society. A nation's wealth is found in its people, and I must seek
to become a well-rounded citizen, a person of solid character upon
whom this country can lay its mantle of leadership.

<HEAD>Former House Members Form Group To Counter Pro-Israel Lobby</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of former House members say they have
created a grassroots organization to counter the pro-Israeli lobby
which they say has too much clout on Capitol Hill.
   But Israel's supporters in Congress say the group's aims are
misguided and pose serious danger to long-term U.S. strategic
interests.
   Board members of the newly formed Council for the National
Interest disagree.
   ``What we in the `movement' think is that the government of
Israel exercises too much influence over the country (the United
States), and particularly in Congress,'' said David Bowen, the
council's executive director. A former college professor with
degrees from Harvard and Oxford universities, Bowen resigned from
the House after 10 years in 1983.
   The idea for the council came from Paul Findley, a former GOP
congressman from Illinois who wrote a book about the pro-Israeli
lobby entitled ``They Dare To Speak Out.'' In his book, Findley
claims he was targeted by the pro-Israeli lobby because of his
stands on Middle East policy.
   ``Plain, ordinary Americans saw damage being done to our
institutions,'' Findley said in a telephone interview.
   Other board members of the group include former Reps. Pete
McCloskey, R-Calif.; John Anderson, R-Ill.; and Martha Keys, D-Kan.
Anderson ran for president as an independent in 1980.
   The council was created in a year when Israel's aid package -
the largest given to a foreign country - has been questioned by
senators including Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Yet Israeli aid in fiscal 1991 has remained at roughly $3
billion, along with benefits worth hundreds of millions more. The
Senate voted 97-1 to add $700 million worth of American arms to the
package for Israel.
   Israel's backers on Capitol Hill said they doubted the group
would have much success because its objectives were suspect.
   ``This is the same old group over and over and I have a strong
belief that it is anti-semitic,'' said Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., a
solid supporter of Israel.
   The council said its goal is to promote peace in the Middle
East, which it says the United States can achieve only by following
an evenhanded policy in the region. ``Most harmful policies arise
from our unusual relationship with Israel,'' the group said.
   It supports placing conditions on further aid to Israel, a
negotiated settlement to end the Arab-Israeli conflict and
self-determination for Palestinians within a Palestiian state.
   So far, the group has had little impact on Capitol Hill. Its
main project has been a resolution seeking to force Israel to open
Palestinian universities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
resolution has yet to clear either chamber.
   Specifically, McCloskey said the group hopes to counter the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israeli lobbying
group.
   ``We are trying to take on AIPAC head-on,'' McCloskey said in a
telephone interview. ``We want members to hear the other view and
we want them to hear it from the community level.''
   The pro-Israeli lobby's leverage stems mainly from political
action committees, Bowen said. He said pro-Israeli PACs contributed
about $5 million to candidates in the 1988 election campaign.
   Toby Dershowitz, an AIPAC spokeswoman, said the public affairs
committee would have no comment on the council.
   The council was actively launched about six months ago. So far
it has about 2,000 members nationwide, far short of its goal of
12,000.
   Fund-raising efforts have also been limited, Bowen said. With a
budget of several hundred thousand dollars, most of the money is
raised from small contributors, including Arab-Americans. The
council said no money comes from foreign sources.

   Memorizing the 258 words of the Future
Farmers of America creed was a high school ritual for generations.
Now the creed is being rewritten to reflect a changing industry,
and not everyone is happy about it.
   ``The new one leaves some of the old standards that we live by
out of it,'' said Joel Janke, North Dakota's FFA adviser, who
learned the creed as a high school student in the early 1950s.
   He is disturbed by the dropping of such passages as, ``I believe
in less dependence on begging and more power in bargaining,'' and
the promise of ``playing square with those whose happiness depends
on me.''
   Janke added: ``They want to get the farm part out of the creed
and out of the terminology. They want to get to the agricultural
standpoint.''
   That reflects the increasingly diverse needs of the 386,000 FFA
members nationwide, organization officials say.
   Members now are going into agricultural marketing, research,
law, horticulture, forestry and other occupations, said Bill Stagg,
a spokesman at the organization's Alexandria, Va., headquarters.
   The proposed new creed is up for a vote next month at the
national FFA convention in Kansas City.
   The FFA was founded in Kansas City in 1928 to develop young
farmers. Memorizing and delivering the creed is part of training in
leadership and public speaking for the group's members.
   With sentences as long as 56 words, though, reciting it can be
tough. Its six sentences average 43 words each. The proposed
rewrite has 205 words in 12 sentences, averaging 17 words each.
   The current creed was adopted in 1930 and revised slightly in
1965. The latest proposed statement, written by FFA member Shriley
Sokolosky of Oklahoma, represents the first significant rewrite.
   ``When the FFA was founded, almost al of the membership
intended to farm in one way or another. That is no longer true,''
Stagg said.
   To take this into account, the group's name was changed two
years ago to the National FFA Organization. While the acronym was
kept, it no longer officially stands for Future Farmers of America.
   The first clause of the current creed - ``I believe in the
future of farming,'' - is replaced by ``I believe in the future of
agriculture.''
   ``The old creed, I think, is kind of behind the times,'' said
Chad Dotzenrod, president of the North Dakota FFA.
   The current creed ``didn't connect with me. It seemed like it
was too much for the farmers,'' Dotzenrod said. His father is an
electrical contractor, he added, and ``I never had any animals or
raised any crops.''
   While he doesn't care for the proposed new creed, Janke believes
a wholesale revision is inevitable.
   ``We're more than farming. We're agriculture, agribusiness,
agriscience,'' he said.
   The National FFA Organization's biggest chapter is in
Philadelphia, Janke added, and ``farming doesn't mean a whole lot
to those kids.''

<HEAD>Aid To Displaced Workers Was Last Battle In Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dawn compromise on financial aid to
displaced workers ended the last battle in crafting a clean air
bill acceptable to Congress and President Bush.
   Congressional Democrats wanted the $250 million program for
workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution control
requirements. But the White House had balked, fearing the measure's
cost could not be controlled.
   The massive legislation, the first overhaul of federal clean air
laws in 13 years, was approved Monday by Congress after months of
tradeoffs and compromises. It calls for a broad range of new
pollution controls to reduce smog, acid rain and toxic chemical
releases by the end of the decade.
   Its impact may be felt especially among miners of high-sulfur
coal, many who could lose their jobs as utilities switch to other
fuels to meet new acid rain requirements. This prompted the push
for worker assistance.
   By early Monday all the major issues in the nearly 700-page bill
had been resolved between the House and Senate. But the section
providing help for unemployed workers - especially coal miners -
remained a threat to the legislation.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., had threatened to filibuster if the
provision, already approved by the House, was removed from the
bill. Supporters of the legislation worried that such a tactic
could induce opponents of the bill to mount a fatal attack in the
final days of the congressional session.
   Senior White House aides also made clear that the survival of
the aid program, which was worked into the House bill by Rep.
Robert Wise, D-W.Va., could prompt a veto by President Bush.
   It was nearly dawn Monday when Roger Porter, the president's
domestic policy adviser, floated a compromise through Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., a member of the Senate negotiating team, designed
to defuse the dispute.
   Chafee's proposal was quickly accepted.
   ``They were looking to be accommodating,'' said Wise of the
White House compromise. ``... We got substantially what we
wanted.'' He noted the dollar amount - $250 million over five years
- was the same as in the original proposal.
   The White House has declined to endorse the compromise publicly,
saying its language still has to be studied in detail. But a White
House source acknowledged that the worker assistance issue no
longer is a matter of concern.
   That shouldn't be surprising, said a congressional source
involved in the discussion. ``They wrote it (the compromise). We
watched them use the typewriter.''
   Under the compromise, workers who lose their jobs because of the
new clean air requirements would get 26 weeks of additional
financial assistance after unemployment compensation runs out,
similar to Wise's original provision.
   But rather than go to all workers, benefits would be restricted
to those who could show financial need and money would be strictly
administered by the Labor Department through the states. With
worker benefits no longer automatic, cost could be contained,
administration officials explained.

<TEXT>
   Republican Fife Symington easily foiled Evan
Mecham's bid to reclaim the governor's seat from which he had been
ousted.
   But the GOP millionaire is up against a tougher foe in Terry
Goddard, the former Phoenix mayor who wants to keep the governor's
seat in Democratic hands. Polls consistently have showed Symington
trailing Goddard.
   Democrat Rose Mofford, the former secretary of state, inherited
the governor's job in 1988 after the impeachment of her Republican
boss, Mecham. She decided not to run for a full term.
   Symington's biggest advantage over Goddard is in voter
registration, since there are nearly 100,000 more Republicans than
Democrats in Arizona.
   But the five-way primary left the GOP badly split.
   Conservatives, especially those who supported Mecham, seemed
reluctant to join the Symington camp. There even was a short-lived
effort to find a conservative to run as an independent.
   Max Hawkins, a former top Mecham aide, is waging a write-in
campaign for governor that may attract conservatives who otherwise
would vote for Symington.
   Mecham has done little to bring the warring GOP factions
together and gave the Republican nominee a less-than-warm
endorsement.
   ``As I've said many times, Goddard will be a 100 percent
disaster. Fife will be only an 80 percent disaster,'' he said.
   President Bush is expected to make an appearance for Symington
before the election, but analysts doubt it will have much effect on
the campaign.
   Recent polls show Bush losing popularity both nationally and in
Arizona, and such endorsements ``are of declining and almost
minimal value'' in any case, said Phoenix political consultant Bob
Robb.
   Symington began his general-election campaign by labeling
Goddard a ``tax-and-spend liberal'' and himself a ``Goldwater
conservative.''
   But as the campaign wore on, the labels wore thin.
   Symington ``has a very long row to hoe'' but that the GOP
candidate is doing what he needs to do, says Robb.
   What he needs to do, Robb says, is find fault in Goddard's
record during six years as mayor of Phoenix.
   Symington accuses Goddard of being a professional politician who
will raise taxes.
   Goddard, meanwhile, boasts that the city budget was balanced
each of the six years he was mayor and that there was only one
general tax increase.
   He has challenged Symington to disclose information about his
dealings as a Phoenix developer to show ``who owns Fife
Symington.''
   Other key campaign issues have played to Goddard's advantage,
analysts say.
   Goddard is pro-choice on abortion, while Symington has switched
positions several times during the campaign. Now Symington says he
believes abortion should be an option up to the point when a fetus
is viable outside the womb.
   ``What he has managed to do is alienate both sides,'' says
Arizona State University pollster Bruce Merrill.
   Both Symington and Goddard favor a state holiday to honor the
late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., an issue that will
be on the Nov. 6 ballot.
   But Merrill said Goddard probably stands to gain the most if it
passes, which recent polls show is likely. Voters who favor the
holiday also support Goddard by about a 3-1 margin, polls indicate.
   Mecham was impeached by the state House and convicted by the
Senate of misusing money from supporters and interfering with a
police investigation of an alleged death threat by one of his
aides.

   Proponents of the Strategic Defense Initiative
remain cautiously optimistic that last-minute changes in the 1991
defense bill will give new life to the embattled anti-missile
program.
   ``It's an improvement,'' Rep. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a member of the
House Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday. ``A lot of it will
depend on the spirit in which it's applied.''
   The House planned today to consider the $288 billion
authorization bill setting military spending ceilings for the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The legislation calls for a nearly
$2 billion cut in President Bush's request for SDI, barely keeps
alive the B-2 bomber program and slashes troop levels.
   Action on the defense blueprint comes a week after House and
Senate bargainers worked out a compromise from differing bills
passed earlier by the two chambers.
   The road from that announced agreement to today's expected
approval has been rocky.
   Shortly after lawmakers agreed on the military package, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said he would recommend a presidential veto
in light of the bill's restrictive language on the SDI budget,
provision on base closings and sharp reductions in troop strength.
   Congressional staffers and Pentagon officials worked throughout
the weekend and Monday to reach a compromise, finally settling on
changes that in some cases give Cheney greater authority and won
his backing for the bill.
   The bill slashes $1.8 billion from Bush's proposal of $4.7
billion for SDI, commonly known as Star Wars.
   The cut represents $700 million less than Congress spent on Star
Wars last year and reflects the increasing belief on Capitol Hill
that although the Pentagon envisions early deployment, SDI will
largely exist as a research program.
   Initially, the bill divided spending on SDI into five separate
programs and imposed limits on each category's budget. The language
was modified to win Cheney's approval.
   ``It's not as rigid'' in terms of preventing the SDI office from
transferring money from one category to another, Pentagon spokesman
Pete Williams told reporters Tuesday.
   Only Congress' interpretation of the language will determine
whether the programworks, Kyl said. ``Oversight must be in a
spirit of cooperation, not finding fault but making it work,'' he
said.
   Last-minute changes in the legislation also provide Cheney with
added flexibility on troop cuts. Negotiators agreed on a reduction
of 100,000 from the 2.1 million troops worldwide. Added to the bill
was authority for the defense secretary to limit the cut to 80,000
based on the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   Pentagon and congressional officials also changed details in the
provision setting up an independent commission to recommend
military bases for closing or realignment. The revisions have no
impact on the overall concept.
   In other legislative developments Tuesday, the House voted to
spend $19.3 billion this fiscal year to operate the Commerce,
Justice and State departments, including more money for savings and
loan prosecutions and the drug war. The bill was approved, 377-40,
and was sent to the Senate.
   The total spending in the bill is $529 million less than the
amount appropriated for the three departments last year and $681
million less than requested by Bush.
   The bill provides $8.5 billion for the Justice Department,
including $105 million in various divisions for savings and loan
investigations and $694 million for the Drug Enforcement
Administration. DEA spending is $146 million more than last year
but $6 million less than requested by the president.

<HEAD>Subsidy-Cutting Farm Bill On Way To Senate For Final Approval</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 1990 farm bill, described by one House
member as the child nobody wants, is on its way to the Senate for
final approval.
   The House voted 318-102 Tuesday to accept the revisions made in
their original bill by a House-Senate conference committee.
   Most of those speaking in favor of the bill said they were sorry
about the changes in farm support required by deficit reduction
mandates.
   ``We have a farm bill child,'' said Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan.
``We would like some other kind of child. We don't want to claim
parentage. We have to take the responsibility and move ahead.''
   After the House and Senate passed their original bills, budget
negotiators decided that farm spending over the next five years
would have to be reduced by $13.6 billion to assist in cutting a
total $500 billion from the federal budget.
   That left the conference committee with the job of adjusting
subsidy programs to cut farm spending during the next five years to
$40.8 billion.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said
all the members of the Agriculture Committee thought the cut was
too great since farm spending is less than one percent of the
overall budget.
   The Bush administration, which originally sought even greater
cuts in agriculture, was blamed for the bite.
   ``It is a bad bill,'' said Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa, who voted
against it. ``It is a bad bill for American farmers and was
handcrafted by the administration.''
   ``The administration of George Bush and (Agriculture Secretary)
Clayton Yeutter in my judgment has worked to lower farm prices in
America,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the
Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains.
   ``In my judgment, it has been a disgrace what has happened to
rural America. ... This bill tries to put a stop to it. It's a
meager attempt, but it is the best we could do under the
circumstances,'' he said.
   The bill directs farmers to reduce subsidized acreage by 15
percent, on condition Congress passes the expected budget cuts
still being negotiated by the House and Senate.
   In addition to the subsidy programs, the farm bill establishes
new environmental practices for farmers, sets up national standards
for organic farming and revises agricultural trade policy.
   It offers programs for minority farmers and dying rural
communities, establishes new methods for preserving forests and
streamlines the procedures for delivering food aid abroad.
   De la Garza said cuts in farm support could be renegotiated if
economic conditions change during the five-year life of the farm
bill.
   ``Nothing is permanent in legislation,'' he said. ``We don't
know what is happening at GATT, but that might necessitate some
changes.''
   U.S. officials negotiating the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade have been trying to get other countries to reduce the
subsidies they place on exports. If successful, U.S. agricultural
sales internationally could change dramatically. The talks are
expected to be completed in December.
   Meanwhile, ``we will have some $13.6 billion worth of cuts which
are painful, unjust and unfair. But we are being responsible as I
said we would be,'' said de la Garza.

   The Senate Ethics Committee, unable to make a
decision to dismiss or advance cases against the ``Keating Five''
senators, will instead hold a post-election hearing that will keep
the inquiry alive for all those under investigation.
   The committee decision ignored for the present its special
counsel's recommendation that the investigation be dismissed
against Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and the only Republican in the
probe, John McCain of Arizona.
   McCain branded the decision to do nothing now - and hold
hearings starting Nov. 15 - an ``act of political cowardice.''
Glenn pronounced himself ``disappointed.''
   Dropping McCain would have left only three Democrats under
investigation among the five senators who assisted Charles H.
Keating Jr. - a major political donor and the S&amp;L owner who
presided over the nation's costliest thrift collapse. The delay
cost Republicans a valuable campaign issue.
   The committee special counsel, Robert S. Bennett, also proposed
that the investigation be continued against three Democrats: Alan
Cranston of California, Donald W. Riegle of Michgan and Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona.
   The ranking committee Republican, Sen. Warren Rudman of New
Hampshire, said the three Democrats and three Republicans on the
panel voted without gaining a majority of four on ``every possible
combination and permutation'' that would have advanced or dismissed
the investigation.
   But the committee was unanimous, he said, in ordering the
fact-finding hearing that panel Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
said could take 10 days.
   Heflin said the committee expected to complete its work and
report to the Senate by Dec. 31.
   Cranston issued a statement saying, ``The public is entitled to
get beyond the malicious rumors and selective leaks, and to know
all the facts. I see this as an opportunity to achieve the public
vindication I know I deserve.''
   McCain called the committee's refusal to act ``an outrage'' that
will lead to allegations of a cover up of findings that proposed
his exoneration.
   Riegle said he was bound by a committee requirement not to
discuss the case, but said, ``It's impossible to respond adequately
to false charges and inaccurate and misleading characterizations.''
   Glenn said he was ```disappointed by the ethics committee's
decision not to make a decision.'' He said he has no hesitancy in
appearing at the public session but added, ``I don't see how that
helps the committee make up its mind.''
   All five senators have denied any connection between Keating's
money and their help for the Irvine, Calif.-based thrift, which was
seized by the U.S. government in April 1989 at a potential cost to
taxpayers of more than $2 billion.
   Documents recently obtained by The Associated Press and others
indicate that Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle had more extensive
relationships with Keating than they previously acknowledged.
   For example, the documents show that Cranston wrote Keating to
thank him for a $250,000 contribution to a Cranston-backed voter
registration project and at the same time expressed his pleasure
that Keating met with the top thrift regulator to plead his case
about Lincoln.
   And they reveal how DeConcini assisted Keating in his effort to
have former top thrift regulator Edwin J. Gray removed from the
examination of Lincoln.
   Keating, who ran Lincoln and its parent company, American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, was indicted Sept. 19 in California
on state criminal fraud charges. The indictment was related to sale
of $250 million in high-risk bonds to depositors from Lincoln's
branches, bonds that became worthless when American Continental
went bankrupt.

<TEXT>
   Former Attorney General Charlie Graddick
said while campaigning for Gov. Guy Hunt's re-election that some
black voters go to the polls ``like sheep'' carrying marked
ballots.
   Graddick urged members of a Montgomery civic club to vote
against Democrat Paul Hubbert.
   Graddick said black leaders such as Joe Reed collect money from
candidates to buy votes in the black community. Reed is chief of
the Alabama Democratic Conference and Hubbert's top assistant at
the Alabama Education Association,
   Graddick said some blacks ``go to church on Sunday and they are
issued marked ballots. ... I think that these people just don't use
what I think God gave them as their brain ... these people who are
using marked ballots to go in and vote like sheep.''
   He said using marked ballots is ``pretty unique to the black
community. It has been that way for years.''
   Reed said that Graddick's claim about him buying votes was ``not
true.'' He said Graddick sought ADC's support in 1986 and was
turned down. At the time, Graddick was seeking the Democratic
nomination for governor, which he lost.

<TEXT>
   A second gubernatorial debate between Dianne
Feinstein and Pete Wilson was thrown into doubt after a television
station said a new format could cause serious technical problems.
   Wilson's campaign said if another studio could not be found for
Thursday night's scheduled debate, a rescheduled contest was
unlikely. Feinstein's camp said securing another studio in time
would be nearly impossible.
   The problems centered on a debate format proposed by the
Republican Wilson, who says he could not come back to California
from Washington on Thursday because he must attend to Senate
business.
   Wilson wanted to debate the Democrat Feinstein via satellite
from Washington, while Feinstein and reporter panelists would
remain in San Francisco's KPIX-TV studio as planned.
   Feinstein reluctantly agreed to the format.
   But late Tuesday afternoon, KPIX announced it didn't want the
satellite format because technology could fail at an important
point in the debate, possibly affecting viewers' opinions of the
outcome.

   President Bush encountered rain
everywhere in his campaign visit to Connecticut, as well as a
smattering of protesters angered by his veto of civil rights
legislation and his Persian Gulf policy.
   In Stamford, where Bush campaigned for Republican gubernatorial

   In Waterbury, about a dozen local black activists stood in the
rain with about twice as many anti-war activists to protest at
Bush's appearance on behalf of GOP congressional candidate Gary
Franks.
   The black activists said Bush should not have vetoed the Civil

   ``I think it was an awful bad move,'' said Booker T. Paris, a
member of the local chapter of the NAACP. ``It will not only hurt
him with black voters, it will hurt him with white voters too.''
   The anti-war demonstrators called for a full U.S. withdrawal

   Democratic senatorial nominee Hugh Parmer
says U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm received an illegal gift and vowed to
file a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee if no one else
does.
   Gramm's spokesman Larry Neal said the charge was ``laughable''
and that Parmer should resign from the race.
   ``Now that he has abandoned all hope of winning, he wants to
spend the last few weeks smearing the senator's reputation,'' Neal
said.
   Parmer said Gramm bought lakefront property near Corsicana in
1983 for below market price and at below market interest rate. This
deal constituted a gift that Gramm did not report on his public
financial statements, Parmer said.
   In addition, Parmer said Gramm bought the land from Dr. Louis
Gibson, who then was director of First Republic Bank of Corsicana.
Parmer said the bank had a political action committee in Washington
that lobbied members of Congress.
   ``It is illegal for members of Congress to receive gifts from

   The telephone poll of 600 likely voters was conducted Friday to
Sunday for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV by KRC Research. The poll
has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
   In the race for governor and lieutenant governor, Silber and
running mate Marjorie Clapprood were the choice of 45 percent;
Republicans William Weld and Paul Cellucci got 39 percent; the
Independent High-Tech ticket of Leonard Umina and Lawrence DeBerry
got 5 percent; and 12 percent were undecided or refused to answer.
   In a KRC poll taken 4{ weeks ago, Weld and Cellucci led Silber

   Bombs exploded simultaneously
at two checkpoints early Wednesday, killing at least three security
force members and injuring 20 people, most of them soldiers,
authorities said.
   One of the bombings struck a checkpoint at the village of
Killeen on the border with the Republic of Ireland, 40 miles south
of Belfast, police headquarters said in a statement.
   The post is on the main road between Belfast and Dublin.
   The second checkpoint hit, also on the border with Ireland, is
near Londonderry, 65 miles northwest of Belfast.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association quoted
unnamed sources in the security forces as saying the two attacks
appeared to have been coordinated.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion
inevitably fell on Irish Republican Army, which is fighting British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the 95 percent Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.
   Both checkpoints have been attacked by guerrillas several times
in the past.
   At Altnagelvin Hospital, staff treating casualties from the
attack near Londonderry said two people were dead on arrival there.
   They said eight more had been admitted, six of them in serious
condition, and another seven were expected.
   Mervyn Ferris, the unit administrator at Daisy Hill Hospital in

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Effort To Alter Endangered Species Act For Owl</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate showdown over the threatened northern
spotted owl turned into a debate over the future of the Pacific
Northwest's oldest forests and a vote of confidence in the
Endangered Species Act.
   ``The owl is an indicator species. As it goes, so goes the
forest,'' Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said Tuesday night.
   On a 62-34 vote, the Senate rejected an attempt to circumvent
the Endangered Species Act so Northwest logging could continue
regardless of the impact on the rare bird.
   Republican senators in Oregon and Washington pushed the plan to
help soften the economic blow on communities expected to be hit
hard by dramatic reductions in timber harvests as a result of
federally mandated protection of the owl.
   Gore and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, led
the charge against Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood's amendment to the
Interior appropriations bill.
   The Senate also voted 52-44 to reject an amendment to the bill
by Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr., D-Ga., to reduce road-building funds for
the Forest Service by $100 million from a planned $196 million.
   Timber companies rely on public funds to ``go up to the top
steep slopes, the older growth, places of scenic beauty,'' Fowler
argued. Road-building expense caused the forest Service to lose
$365 million on timber sales last year, he said.
   Western senators contended the amendment would gut logging in
their states. ``Mill towns into ghost towns, that's what the Fowler
amendment creates in my state,'' said Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to declare the owl a
threatened species in June ``sounded a warning that within our
lifetime an entire ancient ecosystem may be lost forever,''
Mitchell said.
   Forest Service biologists have determined the owl is on the road
to extinction unless logging is banned across millions of acres of
the Northwest's oldest forests.
   The government predicts logging reductions to protect the owl
will cost the Northwest tens of thousands of timber jobs by the end
of the decade.
   Experts estimate about 3,000 pairs of the secretive, 20-inch
owls survive in the old-growth forests of Oregon, Washington and
northern California.
   Packwood's amendment to the Interior appropriations bill would
have eased the criteria required to convene the Endangered Species
Committee.
   That Cabinet-level panel, commonly referred to as the ``God
Committee,'' has the authority to overrule the act's protection of
wildlife if it determines the economic consequences of such
protection is too severe.
   ``I hope we have not reached the point where the Holy Grail is
science and only science and nothing else counts,'' Packwood said
in a Senate floor speech.
   The Endangered Species Committee chaired by the secretary of
interior has met only twice in the 17-year history of the
Endangered Species Act, once in a dispute over the snail darter and
Tennessee's Tellico Dam.
   A final vote on the Interior appropriations bill, which includes
controversial funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, is
expected later this week.

   The seven other men are scheduled for trial Nov. 5.
   The men, who work for various oil companies, boarded with their

<HEAD>House Slashes Administration Request For S&amp;L Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers angry at the Bush administration's
hide-and-seek call for new taxpayer dollars for the savings and
loan bailout are moving to approve only a fraction of the billions
being sought.
   The House Banking Committee voted Tuesday to slash to $10
billion the administration's request for $57 billion to continue
the bailout through the 1991 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Both Democrats and Republicans on the panel suggested Congress
should deny any new bailout money in view of Bush's assertion a
year ago that ``never again'' would taxpayers be tapped for it and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's refusal to testify why that has
changed.
   But warned by regulators that the bailout's total costs might
swell an additional $300 million in the next three months without
the funds, the committee voted just enough money to keep the
program going through February.
   ``The more you give them, the more they are going to squander,''
complained Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., who suggested not approving any
new funds.
   ``Here we are at the 11th hour subjected to the old squeeze
play.''
   The Senate Banking Committee two weeks ago approved the
administration's request for $57 billion. But congressional and
administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they don't expect it to ever reach the Senate floor for a vote.
   Instead, they said, the House is likely to pass its committee's
version within the next two days and send it to the Senate. Senate
leaders would then attach the House version to another bill,
possibly one toughening penalties for S&amp;L fraud, through a
parliamentary maneuver that would allow senators to avoid a
recorded roll-call vote on the issue.
   Administration officials had warned in recent months the $50
billion that Bush sought and got from Congress a year ago would not
be enough - after contending then it be more than ample. Over the
summer, Brady suggested another $40 billion to $80 billion might be
needed.
   However, the administration never submitted a formal request for
the money until Brady wrote the chairmen of the House and Senate
Banking committees two weeks ago, saying virtually all of the
original $50 billion had been spent.
   The bailout ``will virtually cease within the next two months
unless additional funds are provided,'' he warned, leaving hundreds
of insolvent thrifts still operating and losing federally insured
deposits.
   House Democrats, joined by some Republicans, insisted that
administration officials make a pitch for the new money in public
hearings and before TV cameras to share more of the political heat
for the swelling S&amp;L problem.
   Brady refused several requests to testify. Just two weeks before
an election in which polls show the S&amp;L crisis contributing to
voter antipathy toward officeholders, lawmakers were irked even
more when they learned that Brady was posing for photographers
rather than appear at one scheduled hearing.
   ``The administration should have been here,'' Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., said just prior to the House panel's vote Tuesday.
``This is going to be a long haul on the savings and loan bill and
everybody's going to have to do some heavy lifting.''
   The House panel's chairman, Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, said
further money to keep the bailout going beyond February will not
occur ``until Secretary Brady and other officials of the
administration appear in full-dress oversight hearings.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Jesse Helms will try to slip a new
anti-obscenity noose around the National Endowment for the Arts
when the Senate begins debate today on the emotional issue of
federal support for artistic works that some view as offensive.
   Helms, a conservative North Carolina Republican, is leading the
fight to impose explicit new curbs on the NEA's grant-making
powers. He is opposed by a bipartisan group of senators who favor
having the courts decide whether NEA-supported works are obscene.
   On Monday night, Helms introduced a proposal to forbid the arts
endowment to spend federal funds on any works that ``depict or
describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.''
   The ban proposed by Helms omits any mention of obscenity by
name, apparently to satisfy objections by opponents of such curbs
that the NEA has no business making judgments about obscenity.
   At midday today, the Senate planned to start seven hours of
debate on the Helms amendment and a rival plan backed by Sens.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., that would
penalize grant recipients who are later convicted of violating
obscenity laws.
   The proposed Helms ban, if approved, would replace a laundry
list of anti-obscenity curbs that Congress slapped on the NEA a
year ago. The bill up for Senate action today would renew those
restrictions, extend the endowment's life through next September
and trim its proposed $175 million budget by $5 million.
   The current ban forbids NEA support for works that ``may be
considered obscene, including but not limited to depictions of
sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children
or individuals engaged in sex acts and which, when taken as a
whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.''
   That Helms-inspired ban was approved amid an escalating
political controversy over NEA grants for exhibitions of works by
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano, which
Helms and other conservative lawmakers denounced as obscene and
sacrilegious.
   The Senate bill also would allow NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer
to continue his requirement that grant reipients sign a
non-obscenity pledge. The pledge has caused widespread protests in
the arts community and resulted in three federal lawsuits
challenging the pledge's constitutionality.
   By contrast, the House voted last week to boost the endowment's
$171 million budget to $180 million, outlaw Frohnmayer's pledge and
omit any explicit anti-obscenity restrictions.
   The House bill says only that obscenity lacks artistic merit, is
not protected speech and ``shall not be funded.''
   The House voted overwhelmingly to scrap the current obscenity
ban and instead to require the NEA to recover its money from any
grant recipient whose works are later ruled obscene by the courts.
   A similar compromise was contained in a separate bill approved
by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee by a 15-1 vote
with strong bipartisan support, but Helms effectively blocked floor
action on that measure.
   Differences between the House and Senate bills will have to be
reconciled by negotiators from both chambers before a final NEA
bill is enacted.

   The Senate has passed legislation to upgrade
security at airline and airports, including directing the
government to develop guidelines for warning passengers of
terrorist threats.
   But rather than face a possible veto, it amended the bill
approved by the House last week to give the Bush administration
more flexibility in making airlines buy and use explosive detection
devices that have been widely criticized for their inaccuracy.
   The Federal Aviation Administration wanted to make airlines
acquire 150 of the ``thermal neutron analysis'' devices at a total
cost of $175 million and deploy them at 15 international airports
in the United States and 25 abroad.
   But a test of the device last April at New York's JFK Airport by
a presidential commission that investigated the 1988 bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, showed that it could not
detect the amount of plastic explosives used in that bomb.
   The bill, approved in the Senate on Tuesday, now goes back to
the House, which is expected to approve the Senate changes and send
it to the White House.

<HEAD>Court Reverses Decision Allowing AT&amp;T Discounts For Corporations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has invalidated a
Federal Communications Commission decision that allows American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to discount long-distance packages for
large corporations.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here held Tuesday that the FCC
did not fully examine whether the customized long-distance services
AT&amp;T offers its larger corporate clients violated the
Communications Act.
   The appellate court ordered the FCC to review its 1989 decision
on the so-called Tariff 12 services offered by AT&amp;T, whose
long-distance operations are subject to government regulation.
   AT&amp;T started offering the long-distance packages to companies
such as General Electric Co., Ford Motor Co. and DuPont in 1988.
   Several of AT&amp;T's long-distance competitors, including MCI
Telecommunications Inc., and US Sprint, challenged the
arrangements.
   ``We have the impression that there is a certain air of
unreality about this case,'' said the court opinion. ``The FCC (one
way or another) will undoubtedly permit AT&amp;T to compete effectively
against its competitors in the large user market if that is what is
really involved here. But we are obliged to insist that it do so by
turning square corners of administrative law.''

<HEAD>House Passes Fish Net Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has passed and sent to President
Bush a bill that would ban the use of large-scale drift nets in
U.S. waters up to 200 miles offshore and their use by American
fishing fleets anywhere in the world.
   On a voice vote, the House dropped its own version of the
legislation and agreed to adopt a bill approved earlier this month
by the Senate that also would require Bush to seek an international
ban on drift-net fishing
   The nets, which can extend up to 40 miles around, have been
blamed for the deaths of thousands of dolphins, other sea mammals
and birds caught in their paths as they are dragged through the
water to trap commercial fish.
   The bill expands the 1976 Magnuson Fishery and Conservation Act
to include previously exempted tuna in government controls over
commercial and sport fishing within 200 miles of the U.S.
coastline.
   The legislation also requires the government to develop
standards that tuna canners would have to adopt in order to label
their product ``dolphin safe.''
   Some companies, according to lawmakers, have adopted the
``dolphin safe'' label in response to boycotts by environmentalists
even though they continue to purchase tuna known to have been
caught in nets responsible for dolphin deaths.

<HEAD>Study: Balloon Technique Opens Blocked Tubes in Infertile Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new device that opens blocked fallopian tubes
with a tiny balloon can offer a simpler and cheaper method for
helping infertile women become pregnant, doctors reported today.
   However, the technique is designed for a particular type of
blockage, present mong only 10 percent of the estimated 1 million
American women who have blocked fallopian tubes.
   The procedure, which requires neither surgery nor general
anesthesia, is similar to the use of balloons to open the clogged
arteries of heart patients, according to the report in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The balloon is mounted on a flexible tube called a catheter and
threaded through the womb into one of the fallopian tubes, which
connect the uterus to the ovaries. Once the balloon is in place,
doctors inflate it to open the passage.
   Dr. Edmond Confino, the study's lead author and director of
education in obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai Hospital
Medical Center in Chicago, said the procedure could reduce by
two-thirds the cost of treating women with blockages, who now
usually choose between microsurgery or test-tube fertilization.
   The procedure is expected to cost a third as much as test-tube
fertilization, which totals about $6,000, succeeds about 20 percent
of the time and results in only a single pregnancy. Microsurgery,
in which the patient's abdomen is opened, typically costs up to
$10,000, Confino said.
   A surgeon not involved in the study said he believes the
technique offers no significant advantages over still another
method, simple catheterization. Simple catheterization uses the
flexible tube itself to clear the blockage.
   ``I'm not against the technique, it's just another variation,''
said Dr. Rafael Valle, associate professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.
   Confino said the balloon device is superior to regular
catheterization because it causes far fewer puncture wounds and
provides longer-lasting results.
   The device is designed to treat proximal tubal occlusion, or
blockage of a tube near the point where it enters the uterus.
   It isn't designed to treat the much more common distal tubal
occlusion, which is blockage farther up the tubes where they pick
up the egg from the ovary. This type afflicts 90 percent of the
women with blocked fallopian tubes.
   The balloon procedure, called transcervical balloon tuboplasty,
is awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval. In tests, the
procedure opened one or both tubes in about 135 of 150 women, and
about 45 conceived, Confino said.
   Confino said the study covered the first 77 subjects, all of
whom had proximal blockage. Seventy-one of them had one or both
tubes cleared. Six couldn't be cleared.
   In 13 of the 77, after doctors cleared the proximal blockage,
they found distal blockage that could not be cleared, the report
said. Among the remaining 64 subjects, 22 became pregnant within a
year, it said.
   Seventeen had normal deliveries. Five miscarried. One patient
had a pregnancy that developed outside the womb and had to be
ended.
   In two cases of the 77, the tuboplasty procedure punched a
pinpoint hole in the wall of the fallopian tube, but no
complications resulted, the researchers said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Guccione, Penthouse to Pay Former Model $4 Million</HEAD>

   Bob Guccione and Penthouse magazine have been
ordered to pay more than $4 million to a former Pet of the Year who
said she was forced to perform hard-core sex acts and sleep with
two Guccione associates.
   ``Sexual slavery was not part of her job description,'' Supreme
Court Justice Elliott Wilk said in finding that the magazine
publisher made sexual demands on Marjorie Thoreson as a condition
of employment at Penthouse, where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
   His ``cold and calculating ... use of sexual coercion forced her
to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body,'' the judge
said Tuesday.
   Thoreson, 37, testified during the 1989 trial that Guccione
forced her to perform hard-core sex acts in a pornographic movie
and used her sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a
hotel-casino he owned in Atlantic City.
   She said Guccione also ordered her to carry on an affair with
his financial adviser so he would move from England to the United
States. She said she severed the relationship because it appeared
the adviser was going to leave his wife and children.
   Thoreson's lawyer, Murray Schwartz, said she cried when he
called her in California with the news.
   This decision is ``for all the women like her who may have
suffered at the hands of Guccione,'' Schwartz said. ``He has
finally been held accountable.''
   Penthouse's lawyer, Jeffrey Daichman, called the award an
outrage and said he will appeal.
   He said that Thoreson had a relationship with Guccione before
she was employed by Penthouse. But ``during the time of her
employment, there was no sexual relationship between her and
anybody associated with Penthouse.''
   At the trial, Guccione testified that Thoreson was a potential
Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a life of crime.
   Guccione's only evidence to contradict Thoreson was his word,
Wilk noted. The judge, who heard the case with no jury, added, ``I
do not believe him.''
   Wilk awarded Thoreson $60,000 in compensatory damages and $4
million in punitive damages. The judge said the amounts were based
on Guccione's $150 million personal worth and Penthouse's market
value of about $200 million.
   Thoreson, originally from St. Paul, Minn., approached Guccione
in 1973 at age 20. She sent him nude photos of herself and a
letter.
   At the time, she was living in California, where she was working
as a cocktail waitress and topless dancer, did some modeling and
took acting lessons. She also had several minor brushes with the
law, the judge said.
   Guccione said in a statement Tuesday that Penthouse presented
evidence that Thoreson was a former prostitute, drug abuser and
``three-time felon who had violated her probation.''
   Thoreson said she told Guccione she wanted to be an actress. He
signed her to a personal management contract, changed her name to
Anika di Lorenzo, made her Penthouse Pet of the Year in 1975 and
took her into his New York townhouse.
   In 1976, Guccione cast Thoreson in ``Caligula,'' a movie based
loosely on the life of the mad Roman emperor. The film features
bloody tortures, nudity and hard-core sex.
   At Guccione's urging, Thoreson said, she had her breasts
enlarged for the role. In the movie, shown at the trial, Thoreson
engages in sex acts with a man and a woman.
   Thoreson sued Guccione for fraud and sexual harassment after he
fired her in 1980 because she refused to accompany him on a trip to
the Far East. She said she feared he would pass her around to the
businessmen he was meeting.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Prices Lower</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen
Wednesday while share prices sank.
   The dollar closed at 128.38 yen, 1.25 yen higher than Tuesday's
close of 127.13 yen. The currency opened at 128.10 yen and ranged
between 127.75 yen and 128.50 yen.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost
421.42 points, or 1.67 percent, to end the day at 24,876.88. The
Nikkei rose 227.44 points on Tuesday.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bond fell
to 84.46 points from its 84.81-point close Tuesday. Its yield rose
to 7.815 percent from 7.735 percent.
   Stock market investors are fearful of another steep drop after
recent consecutive gains in the Nikkei. Wednesday morning's drop
was the first since Monday.
   ``They were getting reluctant to buy any more in such a short
period of time,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa
Securities Co.
   Suzuki said the market was also suffering from a lack of fresh
news to stimulate investors' buying interests.
   On the foreign exchange, the dollar's rise was accelerated by
selling by institutional investors once it passed the 128-yen
level, dealers said.
   The dollar has risen 2.73 yen in the last three trading days
after a 13-day slide of 13.55 yen.
   The speed of the dollar's drop against the yen, combined with
market fears of intervention, triggered the dollar's recent
upswing, dealers said.
   Some dealers said the dollar may have hit bottom, and could rise
back as high as the 129-yen range, while others said it is too
early to determine whether the weak-dollar trend has reversed
because investors are still wary of the U.S. federal budget and the
Middle East.
   ``The situation favoring the strong yen has not changed. The
dollar's fall to the 123-yen level was much too rapid. Traders were
nervous about selling but did it anyway because everyone else was
doing it,'' said Akiko Baba of the Bank of Tokyo.

   Barry ``Brakeshoe'' Schwartz got
the bum's rush when he tried to catch a bus from the Los Angeles
freight yard to the Hobo Club meeting.
   ``The buses wouldn't pick us up because we were too dirty,''
Schwartz explained. So he took a $21 cab ride to the bar where the
club meets in Beverly Hills.
   Schwartz, a video maker from Oakland, represents a new breed of
hobo: part-time wanderers with jobs, credit cards and, gasp,
automobiles.
   The 4,000 members nationwide of the Hobo Club share their
freight-car forefathers' grimy fashion and yen for unauthorized
rail travel, but little else.
   ``Hobos are known as people without very much money,'' said
Sheri ``Hometown'' Doyel, 23, who did her thesis on rail riders
while attending the University of California at Los Angeles. ``And
here we are in Beverly Hills drinking $3 and $4 beers. ... It's
ironic.''
   Hobo culture is serious anthropological stuff and there is
``something very American'' about it, Doyel said.
   ``People think hobo, they think homeless,'' she said. ``It's not
the same thing.''
   The first hobos were said to have been unemployed men who rode
the rails seeking work after the Civil War. Hobo lore has it the
originals carried hoes for field work, hence the name ``hoe boy.''
   ``In the old days, it was need and desperation,'' said Garth
Bishop of Los Angeles, publisher of the Hobo Times newsletter.
``Most of the young people now do it for a weekend - for a vacation
adventure.''
   The use of monikers like ``Freight Train George'' and
``Minneapolis Jewel'' became part of the subculture. The nicknames,
precursors to truckers' citizens-band radio ``handles,'' were
intended to obscure a hobo's background. But they have come to
describe characteristics of the hobos themselves.
   Don't make the mistake of calling them tramps, or worse, bums.
Hobos claim they are honest guys and gals who work when they can -
not like the petty criminals they call tramps. Bums are, well,
bums.
   The railroads say some of their ranks are transients - and all
of their wanderlust is illegal.
   ``It's hardly glamorous,'' said Cathy Westphal, spokeswoman for
The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. ``Our equipment was not
meant for the transport of human beings.''
   Westphal said the world of illegal rail travel also is populated
by people who would ``just as soon slit your throat as look at
you.''
   And she said ``yuppie hobos'' set a poor example for children.
``I can't tell you how many children get their legs cut off''
trying to hop moving trains, she said.
   Hobo Club members agreed there may be some danger - they refer
to train wheels as ``salami slicers.'' But it isn't enough to stop
them.
   ``Danger is going 70 mph without a seat belt,'' said Greta
Shred, 27, a filmmaker and electrician from San Francisco.
   Several club members have never even been on a train, Bishop
said. Membership is automatic with an $18-a-year newsletter
subscription.
   During the monthly meeting, the call of the steam engine's
whistle, made by a wooden flute-like device, pierced the cigarette
smoke-filled air. A guitar-picking hobo provided toe-tapping
renditions of ``King of the Road'' and ``American Pie.'' A
black-and-white movie depicted hobo life during the 1930s.
   Few thought it was the least bit unusual to meet on ever-so-chic
Wilshire Boulevard, hardly the haunt of the downtrodden. They were
quick to point out that railroads were responsible for much of
California's early growth.
   ``It makes perfect sense,''said Bobb ``Santa Fe Bo'' Hopkins,
who described himself as an actor and writer. ``The wealthiest and
the poorest are those that don't work 9-to-5. We're here to make a
life, not make a living.''

   Here are facts about Wednesday's parliamentary election in
Pakistan:
   ---
   THE COUNTRY - Pakistan, the world's ninth most populous country,
was created in 1947 as a homeland for India's minority Moslems. It
has seen only four popularly elected governments. The military has
ruled Pakistan for more than 25 of its 43 years.
   Rich in resources, Pakistan is plagued with widespread poverty
and illiteracy. Most of the country's 110 million people are
landless laborers earning less than $400 a year.
   Pakistan is burdened with a defense budget that eats 52 percent
of the total expenditure.
   ---
   THE ELECTION - More than 1,300 candidates are contesting the 207
seats reserved for Moslems in the National Assembly, the law-making
lower house of Parliament. Another 41 candidates are contesting 10
seats reserved for non-Moslems such as Christian, Hindu,
Zoroastrian and Sikhs.
   ---
   THE ISSUES - Despite a host of social and economic problems, the
only campaign issue has been Benazir Bhutto, the former prime
minister whose government was dismissed Aug. 6 on charges of
corruption, incompetence and mismanagement.
   ---
   THE CANDIDATES - Ms. Bhutto's populist, center-left Pakistan
People's Party joined forces with three smaller parties to form the
Pakistan Democratic Alliance. Her key opponent is a coalition
called the Islamic Democratic Alliance, which embraces 18 parties
espousing a variety of political ideologies.
   There are 30 other parties contesting the election. They follow
a wide range of political principles, from right-wing to far-left
and religious fundamentalism to secession. At least three parties
are demanding independence for southern Sindh Province and several
other parties were established along ethnic lines.
   ---
   THE VOTERS - There are 47.3 million eligibile Moslem voters and
another 1.4 million non-Moslem voters. Turnout in the November 1988
election was 43.2 percent and many predict Wednesday's turnout will
be even lower.
   Because less than 25 percent of the population is literate,
voters will check their candidate's party symbol. Ms. Bhutto's
alliance is identified by an arrow, while the symbol of the Islamic
Democratic Alliance is a bicycle.

   2 Live Crew took the stage in their first
show since they beat an obscenity rap and came off too tame for
many fans.
   ``It wasn't as nasty as they wanna be,'' said Kelly Jackson, 20,
of Cincinnati.
   About 850 fans attended the concert Tuesday at the 1,300-person
capacity Ritz Music Hall.
   Police observed the performance and said they found nothing
wrong. No arrests were made during the adults-only, no-alcohol
show.
   On Saturday, the rap group, whose music contains references to
oral and anal sex and violence against women, was acquitted of
obscenity over a show held after a judge pronounced their album
``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' obscene.
   On Tuesday, band leader Luther Campbell, wearing an American
flag bandanna, took the stage with the advice, ``If you don't like
what we sing, don't bring your ass in the house.''
   The band often stopping short of finishing the lyrics, instead
pointing their microphones toward the audience, which responded by
shouting the dirty words.
   Some fans thought the 50-minute show was too brief and that the
rappers were unable to express themselves as explicitly as they did
before their trial.
   ``It was too limited in what they could say,'' said Peter Adams,
25, of Indianapolis.
   Campbell performed several numbers with the top of his jeans
unbuttoned. Four women dancers wore outfits that left most of their
buttocks exposed.
   ``We have no objection to the show from a legal standpoint,''
said police spokesman Andrew Stoner. ``The women's outfits were
more than adult exotic dancers wear in Indianapolis.''

<HEAD>State Promotion in Japanese Sex Magazine Gets Official Suspended</HEAD>

   Wisconsin's tourism director was suspended
for arranging a promotional article in a sexually explicit Japanese
magazine.
   Development Secretary Robert Trunzo announced Tuesday he ordered
Richard Matty suspended without pay for seven days after consulting
with Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.
   ``I see no merit in promoting our state in a publication with
sexually explicit material that most people in Wisconsin would find
personally offensive and which is degrading and insensitive to
women,'' Trunzo said in a letter to Matty.
   Use of the magazine is ``inconsistent with our department's
commitment to the state's equal opportunity and affirmative action
policies,'' Trunzo said.
   ``The governor suggested disciplinary action,'' Trunzo said.
``He was furious.''
   Matty and other state tourism officials arranged to promote
Wisconsin in the magazine Hoseki, Trunzo said. A reporter and
photographer for the magazine visited in 1989, touring the state
with Knowles, and ran a 12-page article in February.
   Matty said he did not have time to review a copy of the magazine
before publication of the promotion.
   ``I was acting on the recommendation of our foreign office that
it was a popular, well-read and good promotional tool for
Wisconsin,'' he said.
   Trunzo said he also expected to discipline two other state
tourism officials, including the director of the Wisconsin office
in Tokyo.
   The disciplinary action was not the first against Matty, 58,
since he was appointed by Thompson in 1987. Matty was suspended for
three days last year and agreed to pay $6,957 to settle a sexual
harassment complaint by a former employee.

   Months ago, President Bush was ``talking the
talk.'' But in the language of the civil rights movement, ``talking
the talk'' must be accompanied by ``walking the walk,'' and now
Bush is seen as walking the wrong the way.
   Civil rights leaders bitterly accused the president of betrayal
for vetoing, as expected, a major anti-discrimination bill Monday.
Bush said the measure would have led to hiring quotas, something
sponsors dispute.
   Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King Jr., said
Tuesday the president had pandered to ``those who profit from
discrimination.'' She said the veto ``demonstrates racist attitudes
among those who call the shots in the White House.''
   ``How far we have regressed since the days when a courageous and
principled president supported civil rights legislation and
challenged the nation to a higher standard of equality,'' she said,
referring to President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
   Civil rights leaders' criticism for the veto ended a relatively
peaceful period in the relationship between the White House and
minorities.
   ``We don't have to read his lips anymore,'' said the Rev. Joseph
Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
the Atlanta-based civil rights group founded by King. ``His lips
have spoken loud and clear.''
   ``A few months ago, he was talking the talk,'' said Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., once a King aide. ``He met with people. He said good
things. It was a breath of fresh air for the civil rights
movement.'' But Lewis said Bush walked the wrong way.
   ``The civil rights forces will continue to talk and negotiate,
if not about this bill, about something else,'' Lewis said. ``But
there is a rift, there will be a schism, because his action was
very divisive.''
   The Senate planned an override vote today on the measure, which
would effectively overturn six U.S. Supreme Court decisions that
have made it harder for women and minorities to prove job
discrimination. Two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and House
are required to override a veto.
   Bush predicted Tuesday that Congress would uphold his veto.
   ``I feel pretty good. I think we're in good shape,'' he said in
Waterbury, Conn., where he was campaigning for Gary Franks, a black
Republican congressional candidate who also opposed the bill.
   Asked what signal his veto sent to minorities, the president
said, ``I think it sends a signal that we are for civil rights and
are opposed to quotas.''
   He added, ``I do what I think is right and I think I'll have
strong support across racial lines.''
   In Chicago, Eugene Dibble, a black businessman and Republican
fund-raiser, was distressed.
   ``It makes me very uncomfortable to have these two or three
pictures of President and Mrs. Bush sitting on my desk,'' Dibble
said. ``I don't know what to say when someone black comes in here
and asks me: `How could you support the man who vetoed civil
rights?' ''
   In Washington, Jesse Jackson said the veto was ``a call to a
return to massive direct action.'' He said that could include
street demonstrations and other forms of non-violent protest.
Jackson accused Bush of ``a closed-door policy and he has a
closed-mind policy - he is betraying the American dream.''

<HEAD>U.S. Aid Cut May Help Peace Process; Amnesty Report; Rebel Bombs
Kill Two</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Senate promise to link
military aid to conduct by both the Salvadoran government and the
rebels could speed up peace talks that resume early next month,
some Salvadoran leaders say.
   The Senate last week halved the $85 million aid package and
promised to cut aid altogether if the rightist government of
President Alfredo Cristiani were to withdraw from peace talks.
   If the rebels fail to demonstrate good faith in negotiations -
or launch a major offensive - the slashed $42.5 million would be
restored.
   On Tuesday, the rebels launched their second hit-and-run attack
on a military headquarters in week.
   But their two homemade mortar-type bombs fell about 500 feet
short of their intended target, the downtown Defense Ministry,
killing two children and wounding two women.
   Six days earler, similar homemade mortars were used in an attack
on the main air force base on the capital's eastern edge.
   The 11-year-old civil war has claimed the lives of about 72,000
people.
   Amnesty International today reported a significant upsurge in
the number of killings by army-supported death squads. The
London-based human rights group said 45 people were killed by death
squads in the first seven months of 1990 - more than during all of
last year.
   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria called Friday's Senate vote to
halve military aid the result of ``successful incursions by the
FMLN in Washington.''
   He was referring to the leftist rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, which has waged war against a succession of
U.S.-backed governments.
   ``It's not as if we don't need the aid. Because those fighting
the system, those in the FMLN, are still waging their battle,''
Santamaria said Monday.
   But Santamaria, head of the government delegation to peace talks
with the rebels, also emphasized that the U.S. move provides an
incentive to the FMLN to contribute more to the success of the
peace process.
   Rebel and government negotiators are scheduled to resume peace
talks Nov. 4 in Mexico.
   Peace talks have bogged down on the issue of the future role of
the armed forces. The rebels demand a drastic purge and reduction
of security forces that would culminate in the ``demilitarization''
of Salvadoran society.
   The government says it is in favor of weeding out negative
elements from the army. But it rejects a wholesale purge.
   Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop
of San Salvador, told a news conference on Sunday that the aid cut
``gives rise to signs of hope because it is a recognition that
peace cannot be constructed with arms.''
   He said the congressional move ``makes the peace process more
viable.''
   Juan Jose Martell, a leader of the leftist Popular Social
Christian Movement, said the reduction and conditioning of the aid
``is a positive message to both sides in the conflict.''
   But the defense minister, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, said the cut
in aid constituted ``a negative signal to everything that
represents the country's institutionality and a positive signal to
the belligerent adventure planned by the FMLN. It would prolong the
conflict.''
   Many of the civil war's deaths have been blamed on right-wing
death squads operating in cooperation with the military. Several
military officials have been charged in the murders last year of
six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   ``People are just fed up with this thing,'' Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., said after the Friday vote, referring to the
millions of dollars in U.S. aid sent to El Salvador over the past
decade.

   Contemporary American writers Ernest Hemingway,
F. Scott Fitzgerald and Eugene O'Neill made the grade. So did women
authors Jane Austen, Willa Cather, George Eliot and Virginia Woolf.
   But 18th century English novelists Henry Fielding and Laurence
Sterne aren't as great as they used to be, say the editors of the
newly revised ``Great Books of the Western World.''
   Fielding's ``Tom Jones'' and Sterne's ``Tristram Shandy'' were
dropped from the new-and-improved version. The works of 60 new
authors were brought into the fold with such minds as Plato,
Aristotle and Homer.
   The volumes include the writings of historians, philosophers,
scientists, theologians and others from ancient Greece and Rome,
medieval and modern Europe and the Americas.
   It's been 38 years since Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. published
the original set, featuring 74 authors and 443 works including
books, essays and plays.
   The Chicago-based publishing company said it was time to give
recognition to new writers and a second chance to some who were
passed over the first time.
   ``It's not that it was outdated,'' said Robert P. Gwinn,
chairman of Encyclopaedia Britannica. ``But basically the world is
changing, and we thought we needed to include 45 new authors who
made significant contributions in the first half of the 20th
century.''
   Four authors were dropped from the earlier collection, which
included no women or 20th-century authors. The revised set features
130 authors and 517 works totaling 37,000 pages in 60 volumes.
   The idea for the original 54-volume set came from Mortimer J.
Adler, an author and philosopher who has served as a member of
Britannica's board of editors since its inception in 1947. Now he's
the project's editor in chief.
   He and a team of editors and consultants, from ABC newsman Hugh
Downs to science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, were the final
judges.
   ``We weren't searching for the archaeological monuments of the
past,'' Adler said. ``These works are still contemporary. What
makes them great is that you can't exhaust them. You can read them
again and again and still learn something from them.''
   Not everyone believes the list is all that great.
   The volumes include mostly European and a few American authors,
said Reginald Gibbons, an English literature professor at
Northwestern University.
   ``I don't see many Latin American and African American
authors,'' Gibbons said. ``I think that's very disappointing. It's
a good list, but it's not a great list.''
   ``If they've only just gotten around to adding the names of Jane
Austen and Virginia Woolf,'' he said, ``then they must be taking a
terrifically cautious approach to education. I think that's
wrong.''
   Also dropped from the list: Fourier's ``Analytical Theory of
Heat'' and Apollonius of Perga's ``On Conic Sections.''
   Prices for the set range from $1,399 to $1,899 depending on the
type of binding.

   The dollar surged higher against the Japanese yen
today in a reversal of early October's dollar-selling spree and
Tokyo share prices fell, ending a seven-day climb.
   The dollar closed at 128.38 yen, up 1.25 yen from Tuesday's
close of 127.13 yen. It opened at 128.10 yen and ranged between
127.75 yen and 128.50 yen.
   The U.S. currency now has gained 3.98 yen in four trading days,
after a 13-day plunge of 13.55 yen.
   ``Investors had been selling the dollar since early October, and
they have started buying it back because they became worried that
the U.S. and Japanese monetary authorities never welcomed the
weaker dollar,'' said Naohiko Yasuda, a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo.
   ``But as far as economic fundamentals are concerned, nothing has
changed,'' Yasuda said, adding that market players remained wary
about the U.S. budget and the Middle East.
   ``The market sentiment was reversed quickly, and I think it's
just a temporary phenomenon,'' he said, predicting that the dollar
will settle in a 127-131 yen range.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
lost 421.42 points, or 1.67 percent, closing at 24,876.88.
   Share prices were hurt by the weaker yen and profit-taking after
the Nikkei's recent gains from its 1990 low of 20,221 points on
Oct. 1, traders said. Over the past three weeks, the Nikkei had
gained 25 percent, including a 13 percent gain in the last seven
trading days.
   Investors ``were getting reluctant to buy any more in such a
short period of time,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa
Securities Co. ``Investors were taking a break.''
   Suzuki said the market today also lacked fresh news to stimulate
investors' buying interest.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds
closed at 84.44 points, down from their 84.81-point close Tuesday.
Their yield rose to 7.810 percent from 7.735 percent.

<HEAD>Member of Gorbachev's Council to Quit, Become Ambassador to
Luxembourg</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Central Asian writer has become the
first person to quit President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's advisory
council, a move symbolic of frustrations with the stagnation of
Soviet reform efforts.
   Chingiz Aitmatov, a writer from Kirghiz once touted as a
candidate for the Nobel prize in literature, confirmed in an
interview Tuesday that he is leaving the Presidential Council to
become ambassador to Luxembourg.
   Rumors of Aitmatov's appointment to the diplomatic post had
caused a sensation in the Soviet press.
   The prestigious council, which Gorbachev created this year as an
alternative to the Politburo, is one of the most important of the
newly established or reformed Soviet political institutions.
   ``Young people want to be involved in politics, but I really
don't care about it,'' said Aitmatov, 62, looking worn and tired
during an interview in his office.
   He said that his appointment to Luxembourg ``has the blessing of
the president,'' Gorbachev, and awaits only the agreement of the
Luxembourg government.
   Although he said he ``was not a pessimist,'' he was generally
downbeat about the future of the Soviet Union, in keeping with the
gloom that has gripped the country with the onset of winter and the
apparent failure of what had promised to be a bountiful harvest.
   Aitmatov dismissed people who say the total collapse of ``the
Soviet empire'' would be good.
   ``It is a sick organism, but a living one,'' he said.
``Fragmentation and disorder inside this organism would not benefit
anyone, inside or outside the country.''
   Aitmatov said his duties on the Presidential Council included
ethnic problems. But otherwise, he declined to shed much light on
the inner workings of the council, one of the most important of the
newly created or reformed Soviet political institutions.
   Gorbachev created the council earlier this year as an
alternative to the Politburo, the party body that formerly made
important national decisions.
   The list of members reads like a Western-style Cabinet,
including the ministers of defense, foreign affairs and interior,
the state planning chief and the head of the KGB security police.
   Aitmatov is one of two novelists on the body, and the only
representative from mostly Moslem Central Asia. The other writer is
Valentin Rasputin, a leader of the ecological movement from Siberia
and a Russian nationalist.
   The most famous son of Kirghizia, Aitmatov was catapulted to
world literary fame in the early 1980s by his play, Ascent of Mount
Fuji, and a novel, The Day Lasts More than A Hundred Years, that
expressed the frustrations of the Soviet Union before Gorbachev's
reforms.
   This month, Aitmatov published an epilogue to his novel,
recounting the suicide of the hero after he is arrested on
political charges.
   Aitmatov's departure from the Presidential Council and the
country symbolize new frustrations born of the apparent failure of
Gorbachev's reforms to improve living standards or to shake the
Communist bureaucracy's grip on power.
   The Kirghiz legislature is considering a sovereignty resolution,
like those approved by nearly all of the 15 Soviet republics
including Russia, said Aitmatov.
   But for the time being, ``we Central Asiass can't leave
Russia,'' he said, citing the economic ties that he said now are
more important than cultural and religious differences.
   The four Central Asian republics of Kirghizia, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenia and Tadzhikistan are generally more rural and poorer than
the rest of the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Store Changing Uniform Colors For Fear of Gang Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A supermarket chain is getting rid of its red
employee uniforms for fear they will be mistaken for gang colors.
   ``We didn't want to jeopardize anybody,'' said Steve
Katzenberger, executive director of retail operations for
Colorado's 66 King Soopers stores.
   The chain's clerks - often minimum-wage teen-agers who must walk
home from work through crime-ridden neighborhoods - had first
raised the concern. Red is the color of the Bloods. The other major
gang in Denver, the Crips, uses blue.
   Denver police said they knew of no incidents in which workers
wearing supermarket uniforms have been hassled by gang members.
   King Soopers, which has offered red, yellow, tan and white
uniforms, will phase out the red garments, including shirts, aprons
and caps, Katzenberger said.
   Supermarket clerks Tuesday said they welcomed the changes.
   ``You've got to play by the rules of the neighborhood,'' said
yellow-shirted clerk Mike Devin at a store in Aurora.
   Another chain, Albertsons, said it is sticking with red uniforms
but getting rid of its blue ones, while Safeway said is switching
from red, white and blue to gray. But both chains said the changes
had nothing to do with gangs.
   Employees at a Safeway in Denver expressed concern about wearing
blue in Crips territory. ``I take this off before I walk home,''
said Dennis Williams, a clerk in a blue vest. ``There are a lot of
Crips hanging around here.''
   On Oct. 10, Denver's school system banned gang-related garb,
including Los Angeles Raiders caps, modified high-top sneakers and
certain haircuts.

   Zephania Mothopeng, who broke
away from the African National Congress to help form South Africa's
much more militant Pan Africanist Congress, died Tuesday at age 77.
   Mothopeng had suffered from cancer and pneumonia.
   Like African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, Mothopeng
spent years in prison for his political activities and was widely
recognized in South Africa as a symbol of the black population's
struggle against apartheid.
   But unlike Mandela and other ANC leaders, Mothopeng opposed
negotiating with the white-led government. Unhappy with the ANC's
efforts to work with non-blacks, he and others formed the Pan
Africanist Congress in 1959.
   He was serving a 15-year sentence on terrorism charges when he
was freed three years early in 1988 after being diagnosed with
cancer.

   Bombs exploded simultaneously
before dawn today at two checkpoints near the Irish border, killing
at least six security forces members and injuring 27 people, mostly
soldiers, authorities said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the 4:12
a.m. attacks, the domestic news agency Press Association reported.
   One person was killed by the bomb detonated a checkpoint at
Newry, a village about 40 miles south of Belfast on the main road
between Belfast and Dublin.
   Five were killed in the other blast, which targeted a checkpoint
near Londonderry, 65 miles northwest of Belfast.
   Both posts have been attacked by the IRA several times in the
past.
   Police said that in both cases the bombs were driven to the
checkpoints by civilians acting under IRA threat. Police said a
65-year-old man drove a van to the security checkpoint outside
Newry, jumped out of the vehicle and shouted: ``There's a bomb in
the van!''
   Before police, soldiers and the driver had time to get clear,
the bomb exploded. The driver suffered a broken leg.
   Staff at Altnagelvin Hospital treating casualties from the
attack near Londonderry said two people were dead on arrival and
three other soldiers died at the scene. Six soldiers were admitted,
all in serious condition. The hospital said 11 other people had to
be treated for shock and minor injuries.
   Mervyn Ferris, the unit administrator at Daisy Hill Hospital in
Newry, said one person was killed in the Newry attack and that 10
other people were being treated at the hospital for cuts, bruises
and shock.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. The group wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of
Ireland under socialist rule.
   Soldiers blanketed Newry and the surrounding area in a huge
security operation following the attack. Army helicopters flew low
overhead and traffic headed for Dublin was diverted.
   Paddy Collins and his wife, Cara, were awakened by the blast,
which shattered windows and blew the doors off hinges at their home
about 1,200 feet from the checkpoint.
   ``There was an awful bang and blue lightening outside. All the
windows came in,'' he said, adding that three of the couple's four
children were asleep in the house and were covered with shattered
glass.
   ``We were afraid to go out, but we heard soldiers running
outside, literally screaming. They were frightened for their
lives,'' said Collins.

   The dollar fluctuated in a narrow range in quiet
European trading early today. Gold was mixed.
   A dealer in Frankfurt said there was little reason to expect the
dollar to change its current ``directionless'' dealings in the
short term.
   In the long term, dealers expect the U.S. currency to continue
its downward trend.
   ``Selling pressure will be stronger and stronger,'' said Kenji
Kawahara, foreign exchange manager in London for Dai-Ichi Kangyo

   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.25 yen to a closing 128.38 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 128.90 yen.

   -1.5187 German marks, up from 1.5175

   -1,137.50 Italian lire, up from 1,136.50
   -1.1703 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1708
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9445, compared
with $1.9461 late Tuesday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$371.10 per ounce at midmorning, down from $371.75 bid per ounce
late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $371.65, up from $371.40 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 21 cents to close at a bid
$371.80.

<HEAD>Amnesty Reports Rise in Death Squad Killings This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army-supported death squads already have killed
more people in El Salvador this year than during all of last year,
Amnesty International said today.
   Between January and early August, 45 people were reportedly
killed by death squads in the Central American country, compared to
40 in 1989, said the London-based human rights group.
   Amnesty said killings, torture and ``disappearances'' have
continued in El Salvador despite a U.N. Agreement on Human Rights
signed July 26 by the government of President Alfredo Cristiani and
the guerilla Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   ``Bodies of victims have been found mutilated, some with their
faces completely destroyed and others with signs of having been
brutally tortured. Victims have been shot dead on the streets or in
their homes,'' the Amnesty report says.
   The Nobel Peace Prize-winning group detailed several killings,
including an agricultural cooperative member slain Aug. 1 at work,
and a union member who was taken from his home by two men in
civilian clothes July 23. His body was found the following day.
   Amnesty said its information on the death squad killings came
from former members of the security forces, among other sources.
   Amnesty said its sources and other information ``including
testimonies by former members of the military, suggests that those
responsible for these actions (death squad killings) are linked to
the armed forces.''
   AThe report says four apparent death squad killings that
occurred in the days following the U.N. accord ``suggest that those
responsible are continuing to operate with the confidence that they
will not be punished.''
   Amnesty said Cristiani's government had acknowledged reform was
needed and that the security forces sometimes committed
``excesses.'' But the government has denied involvement.
   ``However, the extent and nature of the abuses and the fact that
human rights violations have been committed with almost total
impunity under this and previous government has left little doubt
of official complicity,'' Amnesty said.
   The rights organization said it was also concerned about reports
of rights abuses linked to the rebels.
   The report on El Salvador is based on findings by Amnesty
delegates who visited the country in April.
   The report contains 34 recommendations, including making full
investigations into violations; strengthening the office of the
Attorney General and ensuring its independence, and protection for
judges and witnesses involved in human rights cases.
   About 72,000 people have been killed in the 11-year-old civil
war.
   The two sides began cease-fire talks in May and are scheduled to
meet Nov. 4 in Mexico.
   After the U.N. agreement, the government spoke out publicly
against torture and established rights training courses, Amnesty
said. The government revised detention guidelines and established a
24-hour office to provide information on detainees, the report
says.

<HEAD>Death-Penalty Expert Charged With Posing as an Engineer</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-proclaimed expert on the death penalty and
builder of execution machines was charged with posing as an
engineer after a Jewish group incensed by his views on the
Holocaust revealed he held only a history degree.
   Fred A. Leuchter Jr., 47, was arraigned Tuesday on a charge of
fraudulently practicing engineering. He pleaded not guilty and was
released on his own recognizance. The offense carries up to 90 days
in jail and a $500 fine.
   Leuchter, a resident of suburban Malden, designs and builds
electric chairs, gallows and lethal injection machines for states
with the death penalty, including Tennessee, New Jersey, Delaware,
Illinois and Missouri.
   He also has served as a technical adviser to states on
executions.
   Leuchter came under fire after writing a report claiming that
gas chambers at some Nazi death camps could not have been used to
kill hundreds of thousands.
   He appeared as a paid expert at the 1988 trial in Toronto of
Ernst Zundel, a publisher later convicted of knowingly
disseminating false information in booklet questioning whether 6
million Jews perished under the Nazis.
   The state began investigating Leuchter in April after being
contacted by Holocaust Survivors and Friends in Pursuit of Justice,
based in Albany, N.Y.
   The group disclosed that Leuchter held only a bachelor's degree
in history from Boston University.
   In a telephone interview, Leuchter said the state's engineering
license requirements are designed to protect the public from poorly
constructed buildings and do not apply to his work since it is done
out of state. Massachusetts has no death penalty.
   While admitting he has only a history degree, Leuchter said,
``The bottom line is that anyone who goes to college has the
necessary math and science, which I do. I've worked as an engineer
for 25 years. I'm not some Johnny-come-lately.''
   Shelly Shapiro, the Holocaust group's director, said the group
argued that Leuchter is ``dangerous because he gives a scientific
front to those who would deny the Holocaust. He provides them with
what they think is expertise on gas chambers.''
   ``We set out to show that he is no expert on gas chambers and no
engineer,'' she said.
   Leuchter said he was not anti-Semitic, and added, ``Some of my
best friends are Jewish.''
   Leuchter had also come under fire for his business practices. In
July, Alabama Assistant Attorney General Ed Carnes alleged that
Leuchter would routinely offer his services as an adviser to states
conducting executions. If his offer was spurned, Leuchter would
offer to testify on behalf of death penalty foes that the state's
execution machines would not work properly, Carnes said.
   ``What he has done is make money on both sides of the fence,''
said Carnes.
   Leuchter denied Carnes' charges and said Holocaust groups had
pressured states to not do business with him.
   ``The Jewish groups have effectively put me out of business,''
he said. ``They are doing the same things the Nazis did,
interfering with my right to free speech and to earn a living.''

   A train derailed on tracks washed out by
floodwaters and knocked down a highway overpass, and two
automobiles fell into the gap. One person died.
   Stormy weather Tuesday also proved perilous to motorists in
North Carolina. A road in Randolph County was washed out, leaving a
house-size hole into which two vehicles drove. Both drivers were
seriously injured.
   North Carolina had at least two tornadoes and record rain - 4.23
inches in six hours - that swelled rivers to flood stage, the
National Weather Service said. No injuries were reported from the
twisters.
   In Orangeburg, S.C., flooding washed out rail supports and
caused four coal-filled train cars to derail and hit a highway
overpass above the tracks, Highway Department spokesman Sam McCuen
said.
   The bridge collapsed, and two automobiles plunged into the
chasm, killing one person and injuring two others, McCuen said.
   Another highway bridge washed out about five miles away and one
car drove through, injuring two people.
   In Asheboro, N.C., at least 6 inches of rain left a
30-foot-long, 20-foot-deep hole in a road, and two vehicles fell
in. One driver was hospitalized in critical condition, the other in
serious condition.
   ``It was scary, very scary,'' said Linda Hicks, co-owner of the
wrecking service that towed one of the vehicles out of the pit.
``This was a first for me, and I hope and pray this is the last. It
was a bad scene.''

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man in a blue toll-taker's uniform
cheerfully greeted motorists, made change and wrote receipts on a
busy expressway for several hours before co-workers realized he was
an impostor.
   ``He was actually pretty good,'' said Richard Gilkison, who
noticed when the stranger showed up bright and early to take
15-cent tolls at the Crosstown Expressway Friday morning.
   ``He'd collect for an hour or two, then take himself a little
break. He looked real professional, waving a flag and everything.''
   Crosstown officials are accustomed to vagrants who shove paper
or clothing into automatic bins, then run out to collect the
blocked change, said toll manager Peter Bond. This man was a bit
more open, he said.
   Instead of jail, police took the impostor to a homeless shelter.
They did not publicly identify him.
   Bond said the average daily take from each booth is about $265,
much of which is collected by toll-takers during rush hour. He said
he isn't sure how much money was collected during the Friday
morning shift.
   ``It's fascinating that he went to the trouble of wearing the
uniform,'' said Laura Blaine, chairwoman of the Tampa-Hillsborough
Expressway Authority. ``He could have just asked for a job.''

<HEAD>Lugar Says Conflict Close in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said today ``we
are very close to conflict'' in the Persian Gulf and that people
should not misinterpret recent developments as indicating peace is
at hand.
   ``The fact is that we're headed toward conflict,'' Lugar, a
member and former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said during an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   ``We're headed toward conflict because Saddam (Hussein) is
reinforcing, as far as we can see, his forces in Kuwait, shows no
sign whatsoever of giving up anything, and the United Nations is on
a collision course to make sure he does give it up,'' Lugar said.
   He was asked about reports that the Saudi defense minister,
Prince Sultan, had raised the possibility Iraq might gain territory
in return for ending its occupation of Kuwait.
   ``I don't think the Saudis are prepared to compromise,'' Lugar
said. ``I think the remarks were unfortunate for two reasons. First
of all, they gave an impression to world markets that peace was at
hand. ... Secondly, it has raised once again questions as to how
fragile the coalition of all the forces trying to undergird the
United Nations resolutions may be.''
   Prince Bandar, the Saudi envoy in Washington, denied his country
had suggested that Kuwait make a deal with Iraq.
   ``I think the possibility of armed conflict depends entirely
upon our ability and willingness to bring it about,'' Lugar said.
   ``I would hope that it would be perfectly clear to Saddam
Hussein and to the rest of the world that we are very close to
conflict, if the Iraqis don't move they're likely to be pushed out,
peace is not at hand, and that people would not misinterpret or try
to misinterpret these small signs as they see them,'' Lugar said.

   A highway prank proved lethal when a
scarecrow dangled from an overpass so frightened a motorist that
she swerved to avoid it, and ended up in a ditch.
   Tracey Ann Pearson, 28, of Clio was driving along Intersaate 69
in Genesee County Monday night when she noticed the hay dummy,
which appeared to be standing in the road, Davison Township Police
said Tuesday.
   When Pearson swerved into a ditch, her car rolled over, and she
was tossed out and fatally injured, said Officer Donald Brock.
   The scarecrow had been stolen from the lawn of a house about
three miles from the accident site, Brock said. The culprits who
hung the scarecrow could face charges of negligent homicide, but no
arrests were made Tuesday, he said.

<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi's government spoke
with militia leaders today about withdrawing their forces from
Beirut under a peace plan aimed at ending the nation's 15-year-old
civil war.
   At the same time, the victims of a slaying that jeopardized the
peace process - Christian leader Dany Chamoun, his wife and two
small sons - were buried at the family's hometown of Deir Al-Kamar
southeast of Beirut.
   The four were gunned down in their apartment in Beirut's eastern
suburb of Baabda on Sunday. No group has claimed responsibility for
the killings.
   Chamoun, 56, the younger son of former President Camille
Chamoun, was a staunch ally of defeated rebel. Gen. Michel Aoun.
Chamoun's killing came eight days after Syrian and Lebanese troops
crushed Aoun's 11-month mutiny in an assault on his tiny enclave.
   The attack left 550 people dead and more than 1,200 wounded.
Aoun took refuge in the French Embassy, where he remains.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
efforts to create a militia-free greater Beirut ``are now on the
front burner.''
   On Tuesday, Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam met with
Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic, and Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni
Moslem.
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, also took
part in the talks along with the army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud.
   Syria has 40,000 troops deployed in most of the war-torn nation
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 21-nation Arab League.
   The government source said a committee handling contacts with
militia leaders was instructed after Khaddam's visit to ``work out
the mechanism for the militia withdrawal from greater Beirut.'' For
years, Christian and Moslem militias have battled for control of
the region.
   The committee, comprised of the agriculture and defense
ministers ``informed the militia leaders in telephone contacts that
the greater Beirut plan enjoys Syria's unlimited support,'' the
source said. ``The committee did not register any serious rejection
of the greater Beirut plan.''
   Greater Beirut stretches along a 15-mile coastal strip from the
Dog River in the north to the Damour River in the south and covers
the city's immediate southern and southeastern suburbs.
   ``The greater Beirut is expected to start taking shape very
soon. Maybe as of next week,'' the source said.
   After his talks in Beirut, Khaddam told reporters that Syria
``will extend all forms of assisstance to help the government
assert its authority over lebanon's entire territory.''
   Khaddam said he was confident that all Christian and Moslem
militias ``will cooperate with efforts to re-establish state
authority and restore the reins of power to the government.''

<HEAD>Balkan Meeting Points to Gradual Opening of Albania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gathering of Balkan foreign ministers
that opened today is one more sign that Albania, Europe's most
backward country, is gradually cracking out of its Stalinist shell.
   The two-day meeting is only the second such gathering since
World War II, and the first high-level international meeting in
Tirana in decades.
   Albania's government virtually sealed the tiny country for
years, but has been seeking slowly to end its isolation.
   The gathering opened with calls for closer cooperation in the
region, which in the past has been a powder keg of Europe.
   But differences immediately emerged, with Greece taking a swipe
at Albania on the treatment of its Greek minority.
   In his opening speech, Albanian President Ramiz Alia called for
a ``zone of peace and security'' in the Balkans: Greece, Turkey,
Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania.
   The meeting underscored dramatic changes in Europe since the
first Balkans meeting in Belgrade, in February 1988.
   The fall of communism in Eastern Europe has brought new
freedoms, but has also made for an upsurge in nationalist feelings
- especially in the Balkans, where the mix of of religions and
ethnic groups has always been volatile.
   Yugoslavia, where ethnic divisions are so fierce that the
country may split apart, is at odds with Albania over the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, an ancient heartland of the Serbian republic,
bordering Albania.
   Greece and Turkey are traditional enemies, divided today over
the fate of Cyprus.
   Albania and Greece disagree over Albania's alleged mistreatment
of its estimated 400,000 Greek minority.
   Bulgaria and Romania are quarrelling over cross-border
pollution.
   The Serbs in Yugosalvia want more rights for the ethnic Serbs in
Romania.
   And Bulgaria, Greece and Yugoslavia disagree over who really
should control the territory known today as the southern Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia.
   Bulgaria's foreign minister, Luben Gotsev, supported by his
Greek counterpart Antonis Samaras, proposed forming a secretariat
in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, to coordinate regional
cooperation.
   Gotsev, Samaras, and Romania's foreign minister, Adrian Nastase,
all urged measures to overcome the region's ethnic, religious and
historical differences.
   Bulgaria and Romania proposed that a Balkan summit be held next
year. Romania urged that a code of conduct on ethnic matters be
considered.
   Samaras, apparently referring to Albania's treatment of its
Greek minority, asked the session: ``Can we call a country free if
any man or woman in this country is not allowed to exercise fully
their religious rights? ... Does this not also apply to political
and economic rights?''
   In the wake of Eastern Europe's revolutions, Albania has
embarked on cautious domestic reform and moved to end its isolation
abroad.
   It restored diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union and is seeking
the same links with the United States.
   The Balkan nation of 3 million people has also declared it wants
to join the 34-nation Helsinki process. Albania was the only
European nation not to sign the Helsinki Final Act in 1975.
   To be admitted, Albania is likely to have to take human rights
reform further than it has to date.
   On Tuesday, as diplomats and journalists arrived in Tirana for
the Balkan meeting, Albania's Communist-run daily published the
draft of an election law that for the first time permits secret
ballots and multiple candidacies for each of the 250 seats in the
Communist-run Parliament.
   However, the draft stopped short of permitting any new political
parties, and a legal expert indicated Alia does not intend to
abandon one-party rule.
   ``There will be pluralism of opinions,'' Aleks Luarasi told
reporters. ``But there won't be any party pluralism.''

<HEAD>Final Arguments in Former Winery Worker's Murder Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor summarizing his case
against accused murderer Ramon Salcido portrayed the winery worker
as a methodical killer who bandaged his own finger while slashing
his victims' throats.
   Salcido was lucid when he slashed the throats of his three
daughters, left them to die at a dump, then pondered killing more
of his family, prosecutor Peter Bumerts told the jury in final
arguments Tuesday.
   ``Before he even leaves the dump, he's thinking about his next
victims,'' Bumerts told the San Mateo Superior Court jury.
   Salcido, 29, has admitted killing seven people, including six
family members, during the April 1989 wine country rampage. Defense
attorney Marteen Miller argued that Salcido was incapacitated by
mental problems, drugs and alcohol at the time of the slayings.
   Miller asked jurors to ``have the courage'' to convict Salcido
of less than first-degree murder, which carries the death penalty
in circumstances of multiple murder. Second-degree murder carries a
basic penalty of 15 years to life, while terms for manslaughter can
range from two to 11 years.
   Bumerts displayed poster-sized color photographs of the shot and
stabbed bodies.
   ``The fact is Angela Salcido was shot in the head and the arm by
the defendant,'' Bumerts said as he posted a photo of Salcido's
24-year-old wife, Angela, dead in the couple's Boyes Hot Springs
home.
   Prosecutors have said Salcido was angry at his wife after
learning that their first child, who was conceived before they were
married, was fathered by another man.
   Defense witnesses testified that Salcido was an atypical Mexican
man who was overwhelmed by financial and legal problems.
   Bumerts portrayed Salcido as a methodical killer who already had
slain five family members by the time he arrived at the Grand Cru
Winery to shoot his co-workers on April 14, 1989. He challenged the
defense allegation that Salcido was suicidal.
   ``Here is a man who wants to kill himself, stepping over dead
bodies to get to a bandage to bandage his finger ... which he cut
while killing people,'' Bumerts said.
   The trial began Sept. 17 and the jury was scheduled to begin
deliberations today following instructions from the judge.
   Salcido is charged with fatally shooting his wife, Angela, 24,
and cutting the throats of their three daughters. Sofia, 4, and
Teresa, 22 months, died. Carmina, then 2, survived, telling
detectives, ``Daddy cut me.'' Now 4 years old, Carmina has been
adopted by a wealthy couple.
   Salcido also is accused of fatally stabbing his mother-in-law,
Marian Richards, 47, and her daughter, Ruth, 12, and cutting the
throat of another Richards daughter, Marie, 8, and shooting to
death co-worker Tracey Toovey, 35.
   Salcido also faces two counts of attempted murder for attacks on
Carmina, another co-worker, Kenneth Butti, and Butti's wife, Terri.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Simultaneous bomb attacks at
two security checkpoints in Northern Ireland today killed six
soldiers and left a civilian missing and presumed dead, police
said. The IRA claimed responsibility.
   Five men were arrested in the Irish Republic in connection with
the predawn attacks, which also injured at least 27 people, six
seriously, police said.
   Police said in both cases, the bombs were driven to the
checkpoints by civilians acting under Irish Republican Army threat.
One of the drivers, an elderly man, warned the soldiers at a
checkpoint, but not in time.
   The IRA claimed those forced to drive the bombs to the
checkpoints were ``collaborators,'' who had done construction work
for the security forces.
   A police spokesman in Dublin said the five men were arrested
just across the border from the checkpoint near Londonderry, 65
miles northwest of Belfast, where five of the soldiers were killed
and the civilian was reported missing.
   The other soldier was killed at a security checkpoint in Newry,
a village about 40 miles south of Belfast, police said.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was said to be ``deeply
shocked'' by the bombings.
   Hospital officials said the injured included six members of the
security forces, all of them seriously hurt.
   Both checkpoints are on the border between Northern Ireland and
the Irish Republic. The Newry station is located on the main road
between Belfast and Dublin. Both posts have been attacked by the
IRA several times in the past.
   The missing civilian at Londonderry was believed to be the
driver of the car carrying the bomb, police said.
   At the Newry checkpoint, police said, a 65-year-old man drove up
in a van, jumped out and shouted: ``There's a bomb in the van!''
   It exploded before police, soldiers and the driver had time to
get clear. The driver suffered a broken leg.
   Police said both bombs exploded just after 4 a.m.
   The IRA claim of responsibility came in a statement to the
British domestic statement to the British domestic news agency
Press Association in Belfast. It warned that attacks would continue
until Britain abandoned its ``futile war in Ireland.''
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of
Ireland under socialist rule.
   In Dublin, the Republic of Ireland condemned the killings.
   ``The people who carried out these savage murders stand
condemned by the overwhelming majority of people on this Island,''
said Prime Minister Charles Haughey. ``Their actions are futile and
serve no purpose other than to bring suffering and tragedy in their
wake.''
   Soldiers blanketed Newry and the surrounding area in a huge
security operation following the attack. Army helicopters flew low
overhead and traffic headed for Dublin was diverted.
   Paddy Collins and his wife, Cara, were awakened by the blast,
which shattered windows and blew the doors off hinges at their home
about 1,200 feet from the checkpoint.
   ``There was an awful bang and blue lightening outside. All the
windows came in,'' he said, adding that three of the couple's four
children were asleep in the house and were covered with shattered
glass.
   ``We were afraid to go out, but we heard soldiers running
outside, literally screaming. They were frightened for their
lives,'' said Collins.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A potentially deadly bacterial cousin of toxic
shock syndrome is on the rise, targeting both children and adults,
scientists say.
   Researchers at a national microbiology conference said Tuesday
the illness is a severe streptococcal infection. Strep is
frequently thought of as the cause of strep throat. But in rare
cases it can cause extremely serious infections, such as the
pneumonia that killed Muppets creator Jim Henson in May.
   Three years ago, researchers began to talk of toxic shock caused
by strep, not the staph bacteria linked to tampon use. Toxic shock
is characterized by low blood pressure, rash, peeling skin and
multi-organ infections.
   Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and in Pima
County, Ariz., studied 128 cases of group-A strep infections in 10
hospitals in the Tucson area from 1985 to 1990. None of the 54
cases from 1985 to 1987 resembled toxic shock syndrome. But six of
the 74 infections studied from 1988 to 1990 did.
   The pattern is clear, Dr. Charles Hoge of the CDC reported at
the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy: ``Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome was
significantly more likely to occur'' after 1988.
   One of the six patients died; for all the group-A strep
infection patients in the study, the death rate was 20 percent.
   Toxic shock syndrome gets its name from the toxins produced by
the bacteria at fault. Lab findings from the Arizona study suggest
a toxin may also be the culprit in the serious strep infections,
Hoge said.
   Three of the Arizona toxic shock-like cases occurred in
children, and other researchers also reported waves of serious
strep infections in youngsters.
   Doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.,
reported that eight of their 29 cases of group-A strep from 1971 to
1990 had symptoms resembling toxic shock syndrome. The hospital has
seen four cases this year.
   ``We have not had four children previously in one year with
multi-systemic streptococcal syndrome,'' said Dr. Mary Anne
Jackson. ``We're trying to draw the attention of clinicians to this
entity ... tell them to think of this.''
   Doctors make a diagnosis based on blood tests showing ``group
A'' streptococcal bacteria, accompanied by a syndrome of symptoms
including low blood pressure and shock; skin rash, flaking or
inflamed skin; and the spread of infection to organs such as the
kidneys or heart.
   Doctors at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
reported 16 such cases over 10 years.
   Strep was once the frequent cause of serious illnesses such as
scarlet fever and rheumatic fever, but the most dangerous strains,
for the most part, faded from view around the 1940s.
   Henson was the most famous recent victim of severe streptococcal
illness; he died of a rapidly spreading pneumonia. When group-A
strep infections proceed to the bloodstream, the fatality rate is
20 percent to 30 percent.

   A grenade and shell casings in unclaimed
luggage caused quite a stir at Los Angeles International Airport
until detectives found they were movie props owned by an actor
returning from the East Coast.
   The Police Department bomb squad was called Tuesday morning to
remove three bags said to contain ``live'' explosives and a
disassembled rifle.
   The bags apparently arrived Sunday aboard a United Airlines
flight from Washington's Dulles Airport, said airport spokesman Lee
Nichols.
   ``United has had the bags for a couple of days and nobody
claimed them,'' Nichols said.
   When a United employee opened a bag in an attempt to identify
the owner, ``ammunition'' and a ``grenade'' were showing.
   ``An individual who shipped the luggage missed a flight out of
Dulles and he didn't arrive until today. He was an actor
participating in movie filming on the East Coast,'' Detective
Richard Kensic of the Police Department's Criminal Conspiracy
Section said Tuesday.
   Actor Jose Alvarez, 26, of Los Angeles was questioned about the
incident and released, said Detective Edward Brimmer.
   ``He was somewhat shocked by the whole thing. At first he didn't
see the significance,'' Brimmer said. ``Then he hit his head and
said, `Oh, my God, I had that hand grenade in there, didn't I?'''
   It isn't unlawful to have such items, the detective said. But it
is against the law to represent them as genuine explosives.
   The discovery immediately raised questions about airline
security procedures.
   ``I can't comment on that,'' United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker
said from the airline's Chicago headquarters. ``We use a variety of
security measures to make sure contraband doesn't get through,''
she said.
   The baggage claim area was cordoned off but operations weren't
affected, airport official Tom Winfrey said.

   Some hostages in Iraq are not given enough food,
many are sick and several rioted to protest the conditions, Britons
returning home from Iraq said today. One diabetic said he was
denied insulin.
   ``We were in really bad shape,'' Jim Thompson, one of 32 Britons
freed Tuesday, told reporters on the flight home from Iraq.
   Thompson, 50, an engineering company manager, said he was among
15 foreigners held as human shields at an Iraqi armaments factory.
   President Saddam Hussein has prevented hundreds of Westerners
from leaving Iraq or occupied Kuwait since his forces invaded the
emirate on Aug. 2, and some detainees are being held at strategic
locations to prevent an attack.
   ``We told the guards, unless you do something ... we are going
to have a disturbance,'' Thompson was quoted as saying.
   He said when nothing was done, they tore down fences, broke
windows, daubed anti-Saddam remarks on walls and shouted
anti-Saddam slogans until guards forced them back into their rooms
at gunpoint.
   He did not say where the factory was located or when the
incident happened.
   Others told of being moved from site to site as part of Iraq's
human shield policy.
   Syd McCann, 52, said after Iraqi troops stopped him from
escaping across the Syrian border, he was held at two strategic
locations outside Baghdad.
   One was a factory making machine parts. The other was a factory
he believed was making explosives or chemicals.
   ``They tended to drive us backwards and forwards,'' he said.
   London sales executive John York, a diabetic, told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview:
   ``The Iraqi authorities would not give me the insulin. I have
since found out ... that there is plenty of insulin available in
Iraq.''
   Doctors on the flight said the sick included people suffering
from a variety of illnesses including cancer, heart trouble,
diabetes, liver complaints, punctured eardrums, epilepsy and
stress.
   Dr. Ronald Eccles, 42, who was detained in Iraq while on a
physiology lecture tour, warned of health problems among those
still trapped in Iraq.
   ``There are a lot of stress-related diseases coming out,'' said
Eccles, who suffers from severe arthitis. ``People have been
developing heart trouble and diabetes. If they had any medical
problems in the past they are flaring up and are made much worse by
the ordeal.
   ``Everybody was getting upset. You start to get angry, but you
don't know where to direct it. It's a bit dangerous to start taking
it out against the Iraqi soldiers,'' he said.
   The 32 Britons were released Tuesday after the intervention of
former Prime Minister Edward Heath. They arrived in London today.
   The Foreign Office says some 800 Britons remain in Iraq and
another 650 in Kuwait. About 1,000 Americans are in Iraq and
Kuwait.

Corp. in a $400 million deal, the airlines announced Tuesday.
   The agreement accentuated recent moves by both companies, one
poised to grow with new routes and planes, the other determined to
reduce its huge losses.
   UAL bought Pan Am's cherished Pacific routes five years ago for
$750 million and since has become a key airline in that part of the
world.
   Pan American World Airways pioneered world air travel more than
a half-century ago but lost hundreds of millions of dollars during
the past decade of heightened competition brought about by airline
deregulation.
   The agreement on the London routes came after fruitless efforts
by Pan Am to find a merger partner or buyer for the airline.
   UAL will acquire Pan Am's routes into London from New York,
Washington, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle.
   UAL will also get unused Pan Am international routes originating
in San Francisco, Washington and London, as well as gates, hangar
and office space at San Francisco and Washington's Dulles
International Airport, two Boeing 747 jumbo jets and spare parts.
   The agreement will give United a Dulles to Paris route.
   Pan Am said it will concentrate on one major European hub,
Frankfurt, Germany, as well as strengthen schedules to other
European cities, including Oslo, Norway; Zagreb, Yugoslavia;
Hamburg and Nuremberg, Germany, and Amsterdam.

   Leftist unions staged a nationwide
strike today, paralyzing public transportation and many businesses.
The military denounced the action as a Communist bid to foment
insurrection.
   Suspected Communist rebels burned at least 17 vehicles to force
drivers to join the strike, and police said at least two people
were slain and four injured in strike-related violence. Police said
earlier today that two other people had died in a bus attack but
later said that report was mistaken.
   At least 43 people were arrested, including Medardo Roda, leader
of a militant transport union. Police said Roda may be charged with
sedition and other offenses linked to the violence.
   Crispin Beltran, chairman of the militant May First Movement
that called the strike, went into hiding following reports he would
also be arrested.
   The strike crippled public transportation in Manila and several
provincial cities. Department stores, banks, hotels, factories and
other major enterprises closed or operated with skeletal crews.
   It was unclear whether most absentees supported the strike or
simply were unable to get rides to work.
   The May First Movement was demanding a $1.50 raise in the
minimum daily wage - a 42 percent increase.
   Officially the minimum daily wage in Manila is $3.50, but a
recent government survey shows 55 percent of businesses in the
capital pay less. Minimum wage-earners already are too poor to buy
meat, and inflation is running at 12 percent.
   President Corazon Aquino had urged workers not to join the
strike, saying the nation's fragile economy could not afford the
wage increase.
   ``We are not giving in to the 38-peso demand,'' a government
spokesman, Adolf Azcuna, said.
   Speaking in a radio interview from his hiding place, Beltran
said the work stoppage would continue Thursday if the workers'
demands were not met.
   The nationwide strike, the most extensive since 1987, also
marked the first time the Communists had taken such an active,
visible role in a labor protest.
   The chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, denounced the strike
as Communist-dominated and said the violence was the work of
guerrillas of the Communist New Peoples Army.
   ``The (rebels) have decided to use this strike to promote their
insurrectionary situation,'' de Villa told reporters.
   Leftist leader Nathaniel Santiago blamed the government for
today's unrest.
   ``This anger of our society is a natural reaction to the
government's turning its back on the people and a realization that
it is futile to deal with a government that is numb to the
suffering of its people,'' Santiago said.
   The strike appeared most successful in the capital and
surrounding areas of central Luzon island, a longtime Communist
stronghold.
   Officials said about 20 percent of the Labor Department
employees did not show up for work, and most government agencies
allowed employees to leave early.
   Among the firms shut down was Atlas Consolidated Mining Co. in
Cebu, the largest copper producer in Asia, where 10,000 workers
walked out. Schools and colleges in Manila and surrounding
provinces were also closed.
   Authorities at the U.S. Clark Air Base in Angeles City north of
Manila imposed travel restrictions on base personnel for security
reasons.

<HEAD>No Foreign Concessions at Yosemite, Park Service Chief Urges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Park Service
director has urged the chief of MCA Inc. to sell its food and
lodging concession in Yosemite National Park before MCA is acquired
by a Japanese company.
   Park Service Director James Ridenour told MCA Chairman Lew
Wasserman that many park lovers are concerned that a takeover of
MCA by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. would put the concession
in foreign hands.
   Ridenour suggested in a telephone call last week that MCA sell
the concession to a non-profit or other group or to the Park
Service itself, the Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions.
   ``If the price is right, the government would be interested,''
said Park Service spokesman George Berklacy.
   MCA owns the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., which operates lodgings,
restaurants and stores in Yosemite under a contract that expires in
1993.
   Early today, three of the four roads into Yosemite were closed
by rockslides after a strong earthquake.
   Matsushita and MCA are negotiating a possible purchase of MCA,
which also owns Universal Studios, record companies, a film library
and a television station.
   ``What is driving this is these national parks are America's
national treasures, and while foreign owners have the right to
invest in the United States, that doesn't mean they should be
buying up all of America,'' said Steven Goldstein, spokesman for
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, who presides over the National
Park Service.
   ``People identify Yosemite ... with mom and apple pie,''
Goldstein said.
   Wasserman did not react immediately to the proposal, Goldstein
said.
   Officials with Matsushita, MCA and the Curry Co. refused to
comment on the proposal.
   Estimates of Curry Co. holdings in the park range between $100
million and $200 million.

<HEAD>Artist Claims Petroglyphs His Own Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government was so excited by rock
carvings found in a national forest that it started building an
interpretive center to explain to visitors how ancient people
carved them as messages to spirits.
   But when artist Jeff Kerker saw a magazine story about the
petroglyphs, he sent a message of his own to the U.S. Forest
Service: The carvings were his handiwork, and were only 15 years
old.
   ``I wasn't trying to fool anyone,'' said Kerker, of Bandon. ``I
was interested in how long it might take to make them. All it took
was one afternoon.''
   Kerker said he had photos of the carvings in the Siskiyou
National Forest to prove he made them.
   The Forest Service was waiting to see Kerker's evidence before
deciding whether his story was true. But enough of a question was
raised that work was suspended on the interpretive center being
built at Daphne Grove outside Powers, said spokeswoman Patty Burel.
   ``There is the off chance we never will be able to tell, since
there is no exact science for dating petroglyph art like this,''
she said. ``Right now everything is on hold.''
   The carvings were discovered in 1987 on three boulders along the
South Fork of the Coquille River, Burel said. One represented a
fish, but the others weren't clear.
   The carvings were taken to a Forest Service office for
preservation, and replicas were carved for the interpretive center.
   A variety of archaeologists inside and outside the Forest
Service examined the carvings and decided they were genuine, Burel
said.
   One reason was that the carvings had been eroded, and another
was that they were below the river's high water mark.
   ``That was important, because the petroglyphs were considered to
have spirits,'' said Janet Joyer, archaeologist for the Siskiyou
National Forest. ``When the water rose, then the petroglyphs would
be under water. They were thought to transmit the people's prayers
down to the salmon people.
   ``The salmon people lived underwater in human form. When they
were requested by human beings, they took on fish forms and
sacrificed themselves.''
   Kerker said he had figured the water would erode the carvings
from the soft stone and never thought anyone would discover them.
   Joyer said the development carries a good lesson.
   ``This will be important for archaeologists, a reminder that we
must be conservative with things like this that are not dateable,''
she said.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Dole To Become First Bush Cabinet Member to Depart</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Inserts graf 4, When Bush, to note Dole's absence from Cabinet
meeting.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, praised for
easing hostilities between the union movement and Republicans
during her nearly two years in office, is resigning to head the
American Red Cross, officials say.
   Mrs. Dole, the only women to head a department in the Bush
administration, will be the first member of the president's Cabinet
to quit when she makes the announcement, expected today.
   On Tuesday, President Bush appeared to confirm her departure,
first reported by administration and congressional sources. Asked
at a Republican fund-raiser in Connecticut if Mrs. Dole had
resigned, he replied only, ``tomorrow.''
   When Bush met with his Cabinet today at the White House, the
labor secretary was not there.
   Mrs. Dole, 54, called AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland on Tuesday
afternoon and told him she was stepping down to become president of
the Red Cross, said Ken Young, Kirkland's top aide.
   ``Lane told her he was sorry that she was leaving and he had
enjoyed working with her and that he thought she'd done a good
job,'' Young said. ``She worked with us, she was accessible and she
clearly told her various departments to work with us and others.''
   At the Labor Department, Mrs. Dole worked to strengthen job
safety programs and toughen enforcement of child labor laws. She
was also praised for her efforts to settle the bitter Pittston coal
strike in 1989.
   But others criticized her ``low profile'' within the
administration and complained that she was not a part of the White
House policymaking process.
   For instance, White House chief of staff John Sununu, not Mrs.
Dole, took the lead on last year's minimum wage negotiations with
Congress, labor officials complained.
   There was no explanation for her reported decision to take the
Red Cross job, which pays $185,000 a year. Cabinet secretaries make
$98,400.
   Even before the official announcement, there was speculation
about a successor. Among those mentioned were Constance Newman,
head of the Office of Personnel Management, and Rep. Lynn Martin,
R-Ill., should she lose her bid for the Senate in the Nov. 6
election.
   Mrs. Dole, wife of Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, won praise
from union leaders who had been rendered outcasts in the Reagan
administration.
   ``It's a genuine loss to the Bush administration and to working
people across the country,'' said Janice Lachance, a spokeswoman
for the American Federation of Government Employees. ``It will be
very, very difficult to replace her.''
   ``She was very committed to her open-door policy'' toward
organized labor, Lachance said.
   John Peterpaul, vice president of the Machinists union, offered
a different view. ``I don't think she'll be missed by the workers
of America,'' he said. ``She's been so low profile.''
   He expressed bitterness about Mrs. Dole's handling of the
Eastern Airlines strike that started in March 1989, when the
administration refused to appoint a presidential emergency board to
intervene in the crisis.
   As labor secretary, Mrs. Dole offered few new initiatives. Some
union leaders argued that she was limited by what they perceived as
a pro-business administration.
   Still, she was credited with strengthening programs that unions
felt went neglected during the Reagan era. In addition to her work
on job safety and child labor laws, she proposed mandatory seat
belt use for all job-related travel and reviewed ways to help women
advance in their careers and crack what she called the ``glass
ceiling'' that stopped their upward mobility.
   Mrs. Dole got mixed reviews regarding labor disputes. She and
Bush took a hands-off approach toward the Eastern strike and the
violent Greyhound bus walkout earlier this year. But she was lauded
for her appointment of a ``super mediator'' to settle a bitter
strike by Appalachian coal miners against the Pittston Co.
   For months, rumors had been rampant that Mrs. Dole would step
down to seek political office. Some observers speculated that she
would run in 1992 for the Senate seat now held by Democrat Terry
Sanford of her native North Carolina.
   In an interview less than two months ago, Mrs. Dole indicated
she was not yet ready to change jobs. ``I have plenty of challenges
right where I am,'' she said.
   Her departure will leave U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills,
who also holds Cabinet rank, as the top-ranking woman in the
administration.
   Mrs. Dole's inclusion in the Cabinet was seen as an effort on
Bush's part to mend fences with her husband, a bitter and
unsuccessful Bush opponent during the 1988 presidential primaries.
   Mrs. Dole got her first Cabinet post in 1983, when President
Reagan appointed her transportation secretary. She resigned that
Cabinet job to work in her husband's 1988 presidential campaign.
   A Harvard-educated lawyer, Mrs. Dole has had a Washington career
that spans more than two decades. She worked in the old Department
of Health, Education and Welfare, the Federal Trade Commission and
President Nixon's Commission on Consumer Interests.

   Pakistanis turned out in unexpectedly
small numbers today for a bitterly contested national election
widely considered a referendum on the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto
as prime minister.
   At least four people were killed and 11 injured in disputes
involving rival parties, officials said, and there were scattered
reports of voter harassment, intimidation and ballot-box theft.
   The month-long campaign claimed at least a dozen lives.
   Tens of thousands of heavily armed soldiers, paramilitary troops
and police patrolled throughout the country during the voting.
Today's general elections were only the fifth in Pakistan since its
1947 inception, and never before was the military deployed in such
large numbers during polling.
   About 50 million people were eligible to vote, but election
officias said turnout was light, perhaps reflecting cynicism about
the future of democracy in Pakistan.
   Ms. Bhutto claims her Aug. 6 dismissal amounted to a
``constitutional coup'' by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and that
abuse of power charges filed against her are baseless slander.
   After casting her own vote in her ancestral hometown at Larkana
in southern Pakistan, the former prime minister predicted victory
for her party.
   ``We have turned the tables on them,'' said Ms. Bhutto, who was
unopposed in her bid for re-election to parliament. ``If we win,
they will have no choice but to let us form the next government.''
   Analysts predicted the vote would be close between Ms. Bhutto's
left-leaning Pakistan People's Party and three smaller allied
parties and the Islamic Democratic Alliance, a loose-knit coalition
of 18 parties united only by their dislike for Ms. Bhutto and
strained by individual ambitions.
   Voters in Ms. Bhutto's hometown of Karachi lined up outside
polling booths three hours before they opened. The longest lines
were in the sprawling slum district of Lyari, where Ms. Bhutto's
jailed husband, Asif Ali Zardari, 38, is a candidate.
   Lines also formed in parts of the eastern city f Lahore, the
longtime stronghold of Ms. Bhutto's opponents.
   But at polling stations elsewhere, officials reported turnouts
ranging from 10 to 40 percent during the nine hours of voting. No
overall figures on the turnout were immediately available.
   The government, which is controlled by Ms. Bhutto's foes, filed
a seventh abuse of power charge against her just hours before the
polls opened today.
   But the campaign to destroy the 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto
politically may have backfired. It halted the steady decline in her
popularity and helped galvanize the disgruntled rank-and-file
within her party.
   Just hours before the polls opened a candidate of Ms. Bhutto's
right-wing opposition was gunned down along with five companions,
news reports said. Earlier this week, several of Ms. Bhutto's party
workers were killed.
   Police refused to link the latest killing to the elections, but
the prime minister in the army backed caretaker government, Ghulam
Mustafa Jatoi, suggested that Ms. Bhutto's party loyalists were
involved.
   The victim was contesting a rural seat in Punjab province, where
60 percent of the country's 102 million people live and where the
outcome is expected to be decided. He and his companions were
killed by gunmen who fired on their vehicle during an 11th-hour
tour of his constituency.
   In addition to charging Ms. Bhutto and seven former Cabinet
ministers with abuse of power, the caretaker government had her
husband arrested on Oct. 10 for the alleged kidnapping and
extortion of a Pakistani-born British citizen.
   More than 1,300 candidates are vying for 214 of the 217 seats in
the National Assembly, the policy-making lower house of Parliament
that will choose Pakistan's next prime minister.
   Two independent candidates were elected unopposed, while voting
was postponed in one constituency because one of the candidates was
shot and killed.
   Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan People's Party and three
smaller parties faced the Islamic Democratic Alliance, a loose-knit
coalition of 18 diverse parties united only by their dislike for
Ms. Bhutto.
   In a nation with a literacy rate of less than 25 percent, voters
placed their thumbprint next to their party's symbol. Ms. Bhutto's
symbol is the arrow; the Islamic Democratic Alliance uses the
bicycle.
   Most analysts doubted either side would emerge with an outright
victory, resulting in another shaky coalition government as fragile
as the last.
   Whoever forms the next government will be forced by the
constitution to share power with the president and the country's
most powerful institution - the military.
   At least 55 international poll-watchers monitored today's
balloting, and their assessment could affect hundreds of millions
of dollars in vital economic and military aid from the West.
   In December 1988, Ms. Bhutto became the first woman to lead a
modern Moslem nation. Her accession to power followed the first
free elections in Pakistan after more than a decade of military
rule.
   But Ms. Bhutto's stewardship was troubled, and Ishaq Khan called
her government Pakistan's most corrupt and incompetent ever when he
dismissed her.
   If found guilty on the abuse of power charges, Ms. Bhutto could
be denied her seat in Parliament and banned from politics for seven
years.
   She has insisted her government was competent and clean and
called the president a liar, cheater and dictator. She said she
would demand his resignation if she returns to power.
   Ishaq Khan, 73, was a stalwart of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who
overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father, the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, in a 1977 coup. Zia ruled Pakistan until his death in a
still-unexplained plane crash in August 1988.

   At least 18 people were killed today in
riots and by police nationwide during a strike called by a
right-wing Hindu party that is trying to bring down Prime Minister
V.P. Singh's government.
   Singh said he will prove on Nov. 7 that he can muster a majority
in Parliament despite the defection of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
Whether he can do so is questionable. India could soon face new
elections.
   The government called a special one-day session of Parliament on
Nov. 7. The reports of violence during today's strike came mostly
from small cities and towns in western and southern India where
both Hindus and Moslems live.
   The violence and the political crisis were precipitated when Lal
Krishna Advani, president of Bharatiya Janata Party, was arrested
at sunrise Tuesday while leading a cross-country caravan to build a
Hindu temple on ground now occupied by a 16th-century Moslem
mosque.
   Five people died Tuesday night in riots in the western state of
Gujarat and police shot to death one person today in Ahmedabad, the
state's largest city.
   Another nine people were killed today in riots and clashes
between police and Hindu demonstrators in Jaipur, capital of
Rajasthan state that lies between Gujarat and New Delhi, United
News of India reported.
   One man was stabbed to death and three others died in clashes
and police firing in the southern state of Karnataka, Press Trust
of India said without elaborating. It said two people were killed
in police firing in West Bengal state.
   United News of India said two people were killed in police
firing in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
   The news agency described the clashes as ``communal violence,''
a phrase that usually means Hindu-Moslem clashes. Indian news media
routinely avoid giving specific details in such cases, contending
that religious tension would only be heightened.
   Clashes, stone-throwing and arson also were reported in Bombay
and other major towns.
   In New Delhi, many stores were closed and the city government
pulled its 4,000 buses off the streets. Police stepped up patrols
and reported making more than 400 ``preventive arrests.''
   Such arrests are common in India where the law permits people to
be held without charge if the authorities believe public safety is
in danger.
   News reports say as many as 50,000 people have been detained in
the last two weeks in potential trouble spots.
   Singh, who took office nearly 11 months ago, told reporters he
would try to prove he has the parliamentary majority he needs to
remain in power.
   In the past, his centrist National Front relied on the support
of the Bharatiya Janata Party to pass legislation.
   The prime minister said President Ramaswamy Venkataraman had
agreed to call Parliament into session ``within a week after Oct.
30.''
   Oct. 30 is the date set by Hindu holy men and political leaders
to start constructing the temple on the site now occupied by a
mosque in Ayodhya, 300 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   The Ayodhya temple campaign has triggered violence that left
more than 80 people dead in Hindu-Moslem clashes earlier this
month. Singh sought to resolve the mosque-temple dispute in court,
but Hindu fundamentalists pressed ahead with plans to start
building the temple.
   Advani ignored Singh's pleas to call off his temple campaign. A
few hours after he was arrested, his party withdrew its support for
Singh's government.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party, or Indian People's Party, proclaims
itself to be a nationalist organization that cannot deny the
``Hindu nature'' of India. Eighty-two percent of India's 880
million people are Hindus.
   Moslems, who make up 12 percent of the population, fear the
destruction or relocation of the Ayodhya mosque would have a
snowball effect on hundreds of other Moslem sites across the
nation.

   Northrop Corp. is trying to shoot down a
trademark for a red-white-and-blue contraceptive marketed as the
Stealth Condom and sold in a black cardboard package modeled after
the B-2 bomber.
   The manufacturer of the radar-eluding Stealth bomber asked the
U.S. Patent and Trademark office in Washington, D.C., last July to
refuse the product trademark registration.
   The trademark board has scheduled a hearing Nov. 15 for condom
seller John Hughes, 28, to respond to Northrop's objection.
   The military contractor claims the Stealth Condom name ``may
falsely suggest a connection with'' or ``bring ... disrepute'' to
Northrop.
   Hughes says he thinks it unlikely anybody would confuse his
product with an $800 million bomber.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Kill Two Guerrillas in Lebanon Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops struck unusually deep into
southern Lebanon early today, killing at least two Arab guerrillas,
the army said.
   No Israeli troops were hurt, the army said.
   The predawn raid was into the heart of territory controlled by
the fundamentalist Shiite militia Hezbollah, or Party of God, near
the village of Hunah, 15 miles north of the Israeli border, the
army said.
   ``The terrorists were armed and belonged to the Hezbollah,''
said a spokesman, who remained anonymous according to regulations.
   Israel radio said the forces, from the elite paratrooper
brigade, fired immediately upon encountering the guerrillas at a
short range. The radio report said two or three more guerrillas
were wounded.
   Lebanese police said the two Hezbollah guerrillas were killed in
a fight with the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia. Police
said Hezbollah responded by firing rockets inside Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.
   Israeli troops usually confine their activities to the
``security zone,'' which it jointly patrols with the 2,500 members
of the mostly Christian South Lebanon Army militia.
   Israel maintains the 2- to 10-mile-wide buffer zone in Lebanon
to protect its northern border from guerrilla raids.
   Israeli troops have killed 78 guerrillas in southern Lebanon
since January, the radio said.
   Guerrilla activity in southern Lebanon has increased, with
guerrillas trying to infiltrate Israel earlier this week and firing
Katyusha rockets on northern settlements Oct. 16.
   The incidents caused no injuries or damage, Israeli authorities
said.

   Mayor Coleman Young says he will mobilize 35,000
volunteers and thousands of city workers to fight the annual
Devil's Night arson spree that in the past has left hundreds of
buildings charred.
   The 1990 anti-Devil's Night campaign, unveiled Tuesday, will
concentrate on three areas identified as ``hot spots'' that
traditionally experience the most fires.
   Devil's Night is Oct. 30, the night before Halloween. Last year
there were 223 fires during the three-day period that began two
nights before Halloween. Investigations last year led to nine
arrests and prosecutions, Fire Marshal Donald Robinson said.
   The number of fires was down considerably from the mid-1980s.
   Department of Public Works crews have demolished about 600
vacant and abandoned houses in the hot spot areas in recent weeks
and are continuing to take them down. Abandoned cars throughout the
city are being removed.
   The city is imposing curfews, offering rewards for information
leading to arrest and conviction of arsonists and mobilizing the
volunteers with the help of 3,500 block clubs to keep an eye out
for arsonists.
   Young said the city also was playing down the name Devil's Night
in hopes of discouraging would-be fire bugs.
   ``We're attempting to come up with a more positive image for the
city,'' the mayor said. ``It's obvious that Devil's Night has a bad
connotation. It always has. Then some guy writes a book about it
and it becomes worse.''
   The blazes surrounding Devil's Night have become a topic in the
controversial book ``Devil's Night and Other True Tales of
Detroit'' by Israeli author Ze'ev Chafets.
   The book offers a critical look at the predominantly black,
economically depressed city of 1 million and its frayed relations
with the largely white suburbs. Metropolitan Detroit has more than
4 million residents.

<HEAD>Study Finds Vaccinating Soon-to-Be Moms Beneficial to Infants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vaccinating pregnant women for flu helps protect
their babies from the disease after birth, is safe and could point
the way to other such vaccines, according to Baylor medical school
researchers.
   Thirteen women in a Baylor College of Medicine study were
immunized against flu in the last trimester of pregnancy, and each
gave birth to an infant with high levels of antibodies to the
influenza virus, Dr. Janet Englund reported Tuesday in Atlanta at
the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy.
   The conference is sponsored by the American Society for
Microbiology.
   None of the mothers or infants had complications from the
vaccine, and while flu antibodies produced by the mother's body
were imparted to children in the womb, there was no evidence that
the vaccine itself reached the fetus, Englund said.
   ``Maternal immunization to protect the infant during the first
months of life appears to be safe and feasible,'' Englund reported.
   Maternal immunizations were performed by some physicians in the
1960s, but fell out of favor amid concerns over complications.
Baylor researchers said their study shows protection can be safely
passed along in the womb, without passing along vaccine that isn't
necessarily appropriate in the fetus.
   Researchers believe flu immunity passed from a mother to child
lasts about four months, providing crucial protection in the
earliest stages of life, Englund said.
   ``This is a model for other vaccines,'' she said, adding that
vaccines against whooping cough and Haemophilus influenza B - Hib
disease, a leading cause of meningitis - might be used similarly.
Those diseases kill large numbers of infants in developing
countries.
   ``We'd like this to be a Third World shot - one that could be
used to help the mother and the baby,'' she said.
   Influenza vaccine is already recommended for pregnant women at
high-risk of severe flu complications. Vaccines made with live
viruses, such as measles vaccine, should not be given to pregnant
women, according to federal health officials.
   The researchers gave a different vaccine - tetanus - to other
pregnant women in a control group; their infants showed signs of
tetanus protection.

Oct. 8 on Temple Mount, death of another Arab in Tuesday's revenge

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops sealed the borders of the
occupied territories today in an effort to curb a wave of bloody
revenge attacks by Arabs and Jews.
   An order from Defense Minister Moshe Arens banned the nearly 1.7
million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering
Israel after attacks on Tuesday left two Arabs dead and seven
people wounded.
   In Jerusalem, tensions over the killings of Palestinians on the
Temple Mount on Oct. 8 increased with the death today of a 20th
Arab victim.
   Police sources and family members said Salim Ahmad Khaldi, 18,
was apparently shot by an Israeli civilian on a street near the
holy site during the melee. Most of the other victims were killed
when police charged the shrine, which is holy to both Arabs and
Jews.
   Hospital officials said another Arab also died today of beating
wounds suffered at the hands of Israelis after he stabbed two women
soldiers on Tuesday in northern Israel.
   A general strike was called in Arab east Jerusalem, and uprising
activists ordered merchants in the main Arab shopping streets and
the narrow alleys of the Old City to close.
   In an interview on army radio, Arens denied that confining
Palestinians to the territories amounted to returning to the 1967
border before Israel captured the land. ``We have to take the
correct steps to ensure our control over this country and the
safety of the citizens,'' Arens said.
   He said he hoped Palestinians would realize ``that persisting in
these violent attacks will only increase the tragedy of the
Palestinian people.''
   Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh said the order would ``last
for several days'' and should not seriously affect the troubled
Israeli economy.
   About 110,000 Palestinians work in Israel, and Israel radio said
Jerusalem employment agencies got 20 times the usual number of
calls for construction workers, cleaners and other jobs filled by
Arabs from the territories.
   At the Erez crossing into the Gaza Strip, thousands of
Palestinians arrived today in private cars, taxis and buses. Many
carried suitcases or makeshift bundles as they were loaded into
buses and trucks to go home.
   Israel radio said at least 600 Israelis in Tel Aviv called
police to report the whereabouts of Arab laborers who had stayed
behind despite the order.
   Fear of Palestinian attacks has gripped many Israelis, and the
daily Maariv published a guide today on how to defend against a
knife-wielding attacker. Interior Ministry officials also reported
brisk trade at Israeli gun shops.
   Just hours before the closure order on Tuesday, Israeli
civilians fired on an Arab-owned car near the southern Negev town
of Mivtahim, killing Maher al-Shaher, 30, a Gaza laborer, and
wounding his three cousins, one seriously.
   The army said the incident was being investigated by police.
Responsibility for the attack was claimed by a previously unknown
underground group, ``Eye for an Eye,'' in phone calls to Israel
Television and radio.
   The laborers, who were returning from work in Israel, said they
saw a civilian firing an Israeli-made Uzi submachine gun at them
from a Jeep, Israel's news agency Itim said.
   Earlier Tuesday, a Palestinian knifed two unarmed women soldiers
and another Arab bludgeoned two Israelis with a hammer, police
said.
   The knifing occured in Kiryat Tivon in northern Israel, when
Omar Shawaneh, 39, of the West Bank village of Silat el-Harithiya
shouted ``Allahu Akbar'' (God is great), then stabbed two women
soldiers who were hitchhiking.
   Police said Shawaneh was captured by a group of soldiers and
civilians and witnesses said he was severely beaten. He died today
of head injuries at Rambam Hospital in Haifa, officials said.
   One of the soldiers, Naama Yekutiel, a youth instructor, was in
serious condition today withy a chest wound that punctured a lung.
   Also Tuesday, in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon, an Arab
machine shop worker wielding an 11-pound hammer battered his
Israeli employer and a neighbor, police said.
   Both were hospitalized and the 23-year-old Palestinian, who
claimed to be avenging a friend killed in Gaza, was arrested,
police said.

<TEXT>
   Rwanda today announced a cease-fire with
rebels seeking to topple its government, the Belgian foreign
minister said. Belgium promised to support an African force to
monitor the truce.
   Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the fighting that
started Sept. 30 when rebels, predominantly refugees from Rwanda's
minority Tutsi tribe, invaded from its northern neighbor, Uganda.
   Belgium's foreign minister, Mark Eyskens, said he was told the
cease-fire began this morning but there were reports that the
rebels had violated it.
   Eyskens told a news conference in Nairobi that he learned of the
truce in a telephone call from his Rwandan counterpart, Casimir
Bizimungu.
   Rwanda, in agreeing to the cease-fire, accepted the rebel demand
that both sides maintain their positions while officials pursue a
negotiated end to the conflict, Eyskens said.
   The rebel Rwandese Patriotic Front has said its fighters cannot
withdraw from the country because Uganda has refused to allow their
return.
   Belgium, Rwanda's former colonial ruler, has been leading
international efforts to settle the conflict peacefully.
   Eyskens was joined at the news conference by Belgian Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens and Defense Minister Guy Coeme.
   Soon after the rebel invasion, Belgium sent several hundred
troops to Rwanda to protect its nationals and embassy, but it has
insisted the monitoring force be made up of Africans.
   ``We think it is the responsibility of the Africans and the
Organization of African Unity should play a major role,'' said
Eyskens, adding Belgium would provide logistical and financial
support to the force.
   He would not disclose the size of the proposed force or say how
much money the Belgium force would cost.
   France also sent troops to protect its citizens and embassy in
the tiny central African country, while Zaire sent up to 1,000
soldiers, who have been fighting alongside the Rwandan army.
   The rebels have insisted the foreign troops must leave Rwanda
before they would open peace talks. They also have demanded Rwandan
troops stop killing civilians and the government release thousands
of people arrested for allegedly supporting the insurgency.
   It was not immediately known if the rebels were standing by
those conditions.
   Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, on Monday announced the
rebels had told him they were ready to accept a truce.

   A man who lost almost 700 pounds and the holder
of a record number of records were among the winners who joined to
promote the newest edition of the Guinness Book of Records.
   The 1991 U.S. edition of the book lists U.S. records along with
world records for the first time. The record-holders gathered
Tuesday at the Guinness World of Records, a museum, to promote the
book.
   Michael Hebranko, 37, is listed in the ``Super Heavyweights''
category for reducing from 905 pounds to 215 pounds. He's shooting
for 180 pounds.
   The 6-foot New York man said he lost the weight through surgery,
severe dieting and with help from exercise guru Richard Simmons.
   ``Taking off the 700 pounds was easy - keeping it off is the
killer,'' Hebranko said. ``It's not like balancing 200 cigar boxes
and then it's over.''
   Bruce Block, of St. Joseph, Mich., balanced a world-record 212
cigar boxes on his chin for 13.5 seconds at Rock Island, Ill., in
February. The boxes, without stogies, weighed 90-some pounds.
   On Tuesday, just for fun, Block hoisted 102 boxes. The ceiling
at the museum wasn't high enough for 212.
   Ashrita Furman, who holds a record 25 records, bounced on a pogo
stick and juggled three rubber balls.
   For an encore, he yodeled while walking on his hands.
   Furman's feats include pogoing up Mount Fuji, riding a rowing
machine with wheels attached, balancing a milk bottle on his head
and ``joggling,'' jogging and juggling at the same time.
   ``I do this as a challenge for myself,'' he said. ``I'm always
looking for something new.''
   Also on hand to promote the 1991 edition was Donald H. Burns,
the town crier of St. Georges, Bermuda, who set a world record on
Jan. 18, 1989, by shouting at 119 decibels.
   ``GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!'' bellowed Burns, who wore knickers and a
maroon cape and respectfully held his hat over his heart. ``GOD
BLESS AMERICA!''

<TEXT>
   A coalition of business and political
leaders wants Connecticut residents to stop what they're doing for
five minutes Thursday morning to think about drug abuse.
   The group, called Drugs Don't Work, has organized ``The Moment
of Consciousness,'' to last from 10:55 a.m. to 11 a.m. It's being
promoted with radio, television and newspaper public service
announcements across the state.
   ``For five minutes, businesses will stop ... schools will stop
... TV and radio programming will be interrupted,'' the television
ads say. ``We're asking you to do one more thing in your life to
fight substance abuse.''
   Donald Streater, a recovered heroin addict who once worked on
the U.S. House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control,
said a pause is a good symbol of drug abuse.
   ``It would seem to dramatize what happens when one takes drugs -
everything stops and nothing gets done,'' he said.
   The event coincides with a nationwide effort in which anti-drug
organizations are asking people to wear red ribbons this week. But
William Kauffman, president of Drugs Don't Work, said the
Connecticut effort is unique.
   ``We don't know of anyone in the nation who has tried to stop a
state - or at least make it pause,'' Kauffman said.
   More than 1,300 schools and businesses have agreed to
participate, representing more than 400,000 of the state's 3.3
million residents, organizers said.
   In Bethel, town officials have proclaimed ``The Moment of
Consciousness Day'' and plan to ring church bells and turn on the
lights of town vehicles.
   At an Allstate Insurance office in Farmington, more than 100
workers plan an anti-drug rally.
   William Olds, executive director of the Connecticut Civil
Liberties Union, criticized the effort for not placing enough
emphasis on treatment and on fighting abuse of legal drugs like
alcohol and tobacco.
   ``I think some people would argue there are better ways to
influence the public,'' Olds said. ``But I can't think of an
alternative.''
   Programming on Connecticut television stations will be replaced
by a pre-recorded message from ABC anchorman Peter Jennings during
the moment.
   The message will include toll-free numbers viewers can call to
register their commitment to fighting substance abuse or get
information about drug treatment.

   Albany (Ore.) Democrat-Herald on Social Security:
   The government is in deep money trouble and the economy is
headed for the basement. So what does the United States do? It
raises the payments it makes to 40 million people getting Social
Security checks, whether they need the extra cash or not.
   The boost in benefits was automatic. At 5.4 percent, it's the
biggest in more than eight years. The increase is determined by the
rate of inflation. The worse inflation gets, the bigger the
increase. That's good for those getting checks. It's bad for those
paying the bill.
   Social Security already takes more than 15 percent of the pay of
working Americans.
   Many people getting Social Security checks are well off and
don't need the money. But of course they take it. They're entitled
to it by law. They paid into the system when they were working, and
now they're entitled to whatever they get, whether they need it or
not.
   While this is going on, our government is trying to decide on
how much more each of us gets to pay in taxes to cover the
uncontrolled spending of the federal government.
   There's something perverse about a government that wants to
raise taxes when it already takes from the earnings of struggling
young people so that it can give more money to everyone over 65,
even those whose hefty incomes allow them to enjoy their senior
years without money worries at all.

   The Rapid City (S.D.) Journal on the free market:
   Capitalism is a great tool for human progress, but Germany is
proving that the free market is too free.
   German companies have been prime contributors to Iraq's military
complex, including its abilities to manufacture and deliver
chemical weapons and its progress toward building nuclear weapons.
The German government needs to step in and bring those merchants of
death to heel.
   But we can't be smug or self-righteous about this issue. The
United States supported Iraq in its long war against Iran,
overlooked its use of chemical weapons, and urged other Arab
nations to help finance Iraq. And our nation has supported
terrorism that suits our national purposes and profited handsomely
by weapons sales that aid our balance-of-trade deficit problem.
   The lesson here is that the free market has limits. Governments
need to place sensible restrictions on death merchants.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on education:
   There is a new buzzword in the air these days: Eurocentric. It
is used as both a description and condemnation of the standard
curriculum in America's public schools.
   Like most educational fads, the complaints about Eurocentrism
contain a modicum of truth, but this is all too often accompanied
by overheated and potentially destructive rhetoric.
   Everyone recognizes that the schools' curriculum is based on the
premise that America's political, economic and cultural
institutions are basically European in their origin and character.
But it is a sign of our peculiar times that this feature of the
curriculum should be considered a cause for complaint rather than
an obvious - indeed, inescapable - reflection of historical
realities.

   Long Beach (Calif.) Press-Telegram on 2 Live Crew:
   They are among the most unsavory heroes of the Constitution
imaginable: three rappers from Florida whose most consistent theme
is the celebration of abusive sex. Perhaps only the Nazis and
Klansmen who march before the Lincoln Memorial more sorely test the
nation's commitment to free speech than do the lyrics of 2 Live
Crew.
   That is as it should be. The First Amendment was designed to
protect those at the fringes as well as those at the center.
Indeed, even more so. Free speech always is most vulnerable when it
is exercised outside the limits of conventionality. There, where
non-conformist and anti-social ideas are likely to find their most
vociferous proponents, crusaders from the center find reason to
attack. In that context, a group like 2 Live Crew, with its brutal
street verses and artless performances, seems almost to be begging
for the abrogation of its free-speech rights.
   If so, 2 Live Crew nearly got its way. After a federal judge
held that the group's album was obscene, Broward County
successfully prosecuted a record store owner for selling it.
Fortunately, a related prosecution of the group for performing the
songs in an adult-only nightclub was a laughable failure. ...
   (On Oct. 20) another Broward County jury had no difficulty
throwing the charges out.
   Together, the rulings demonstrate the fundamental strength and
the troubling weaknesses of the law's approach to obscenity and
free expression. Even when confronted with essentially the same
work in essentially the same community, juries can differ in
significant ways. ...
   (But) what happens when, as in Florida, the community itself
isn't sure? Then, the benefit must go to the alleged offender, for
too often, would-be censors react to artwork simply because they
don't understand it. To which it must be said, of censorship as of
other criminal acts: Ignorance is no excuse.

   A Cuban passenger plane with 31 people on
board crashed near an airport in eastern Cuba today, two news
agencies said. One of the reports said no one survived the
accident.
   The Soviet-made turbo-prop went down near the Antonio Maceo
Airport in Santiago de Cuba, a provincial capital, the official
Cuban news agency, Prensa Latina, said.
   The report said the number of dead and injured had not been
determined. However, the official Mexican news agency Notimex
reported from Havana that no one survived the crash.
   Prensa Latina said there were 24 passengers and seven crew
members aboard the flight.
   The two dispatches, monitored in Mexico City, gave no further
information about the Cubana de Aviacion flight.
   Santiago de Cuba is about 50 miles from the city of Guantanamo
and about the same distance from Guantanamo Bay, home of the U.S.
Naval station. The crash site is about 560 miles east of Havana.

<TEXT>
   Opposition groups today criticized the
appointment of a new army chief who was accused of widespread
torture during his days as a guerrilla fighter.
   The new army chief, Maj. Gen. Solomon Hawala, was a guerrilla
fighter for the South-West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO,
in its 23-year independence battle against South African rule.
   SWAPO won elections last year and became the first government
when Namibia became independent from South Africa on March 21.
   While SWAPO was in exile, Hawala was accused of supervising
systematic torture of SWAPO members suspected of spying on the
organization.
   Namibia's new democracy has been cited by foreign observers as
an example of reconciliation, but the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, the official opposition, said the appointment could
rekindle bitter wartime rivalries.
   It said Hawala had been ``condemned by almost the whole world
for his rotten human rights record'' and called his appointment
``as shocking and disgusting as it is despicable.''
   Former SWAPO members detained by the organization say hundreds
of dissidents and suspected spies were arrested and remain missing.
   SWAPO has acknowledged that abuses occurred, but says all
prisoners were released.
   President Sam Nujoma's government defended its decision to
appoint Hawala as army chief, a post that has been vacant since
independence. Information Minister Hidipo Hamutenya said South
Africa also had been guilty of abuses during the war.
   Hawala was traveling today and could not be reached for comment.
   The National Society for Human Rights, a private group, said the
appointment of Hawala was a ``clear indication that the (SWAPO)
leadership ... approved of the torture, killing, rape and
disappearance of so many innnocent Namibians in exile.''
   A spokesman for the National Society for Human Rights, Phil
Ya-nangolo, said his organization was contacting Amnesty
International and other international human rights groups to
register its concern.
   Ya-nangolo said that with Hawala as the army chief, the radical
wing of SWAPO will have the upper hand in government.
   The Namibia Patriotic Front, another opposition group, also
denounced the appointment. ``The NPF strongly feels that it is
inopportune for Mr. Halawa to be appointment to a high public
office until his name is cleared,'' it said.

   Thousands of high school students across France
joined marches and rallies Wednesday, demanding that the government
spend more on education and combat a wave of campus violence.
   At least 5,000 students participated in the largest march, in
Paris. The youths walked through a light rain to the National
Assembly, some carrying banners that said: ``End rape, theft and
racketeering.''
   The recent surge of crime at high schools has included the rape
of a girl in a school lavatory, assaults on several teachers, and
cases of extortion.
   Similar protests were reported in cities across France,
including rallies involving about 400 students in Metz, 500 in
Strasbourg, 1,000 in Nice, and 500 in Draguignan.
   The high school controversy was discussed at a Cabinet meeting
Wednesday, with President Francois Mitterrand referring to the
``sometimes deplorable'' state of certain schools.
   Mitterrand told the Cabinet that regional authorities were
responsible for the budgetary decisions that could ease the
problems of inadequate teaching staff and facilities.

   Troops have arrested at least 40 more
people for taking part in a Buddhist boycott of the military
government, and the army is expanding raids on pro-democracy
political parties, sources said today.
   Twelve members of the opposition National League for Democracy
were arrested Tuesday night after authorities searched its
headquarters and district offices in Rangoon, party members said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The League overwhelmingly won a national election in May, but
the 2-year-old military government of the prime minister, Gen. Saw
Maung, has arrested its leaders and refused to turn over power.
   The arrested League members included four members of its central
executive committee. Also arrested were a member of the party's
central work committee, two divisional leaders, and five youth
members of the party, the sources said.
   Sources contacted by telephone from Bangkok said soldiers have
been raiding temples in Mandalay, heart of the rebellion by
Buddhist monks, and that the monks' nearly 7-week-old rebellion
appears to be over.
   Monks were protesting government suppression of pro-democracy
groups by refusing to hold religious services for soldiers in the
mainly Buddhist country. Such treatment is the equivalent of
excommunication in Burma.
   The state radio said troops searched six more monastries in
Mandalay today, seizing raw jade, heroin, weaponry and literature
from illegal groups including the Communist Party.
   On Tuesday night, Burmese government radio said troops searching
the Masoyein Monastery in Mandalay found 34 rounds of rifle
ammunition, typewriters, duplicating machines and anti-government
pamphlets. Mandalay is 350 miles north of the Burmese capital,
Rangoon.
   The broadcast said people connected with the ``incriminating
materials'' were detained, indicating monks in the monastery had
been arrested in the confrontation between segments of Burma's
clergy and the military government.
   The sources in Rangoon said 40 people were arrested, but it was
not immediately known how many were monks.
   Twenty monks were reported arrested on Monday.
   Meanwhile, political sources said raids on the headquarters of
opposition political parties had been expanded nationwide, and that
``a couple offices have been sealed.''
   Troops ``have been going into National League for Democracy
offices all over the country,'' one source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   It was not certain if all the offices of the pro-democracy
parties had been searched, but the raids were being made
nationwide, the source said.
   ``They (soldiers) are looking for anything subversive.'' he
said, adding that they were not damaging the offices. ``They are
just looking for any material that can be labeled `incriminating.'
''
   The Rangoon headquarters of the National League for Democracy
and the Democratic Party for a New Society were raided Tuesday and
party documents were taken away, sources said earlier, also
speaking anonmyously. Some regional offices of the two parties also
were searched.
   Monks began their boycott in Mandalay on Sept. 6 following a
protest Aug. 8 in which four people, including two monks, were
killed, according to Western diplomats in Rangoon.
   The boycott quickly spread to other areas, including Rangoon.
   Over the weekend, troops ringed several monasteries and ordered
the monks to end their boycott. A group of 29 monks yielded to the
ultimatum but others apparently continued their defiance.

   About 10,000 villagers were being
evacuated from the area of a ruptured dam in northeastern Thailand,
officials said Wednesday.
   The Civil Defense Department said residents of 44 villages were
being moved from the vicinity of Lammoon Bon Dam, under pressure
after heavy rains from recent tropical storms.
   Many provincial areas have been hit by flooding in recent weeks.
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan flew Wednesday to the area,
about 125 miles northeast of Bangkok.
   The 26-foot-thick dam wall sprang a small leak Monday and a
large hole was detected Tuesday, the Interior Ministry said.
   Officials said gates were being opened to reduce pressure on the
dam wall and divers were trying to repair the holes.

   Protesters campaigning for the
president's resignation clashed with police and government
supporters, leaving 300 people injured, news reports said
Wednesday.
   Violence broke out Tuesday at opposition-sponsored protests in
at least 25 of Bangladesh's 460 rural districts, according to the
United News of Bangladesh and the Sangbad newspaper.
   The demonstrations outside Dhaka, the capital, were intended to
broaden the opposition's campaign for the resignation of President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad and a general election under a caretaker
government.
   The Sangbad reported that 250 people were injured in the north
and northwestern areas of Mymensingh, Narail, Madaripur, Sirajganj,
Ishwardi and Rajshahi.
   According to United News, another 50 people were injured in the
southern district of Chittagong when students rampaged through the
streets, damaging buses and cars and stoning police.
   Most injuries occurred when police used steel-tipped batons to
disperse the students, it said.
   Eight protesters were killed earlier this month during rioting
in the capital.
   Ershad, a former army officer, seized power in a bloodless coup
in 1982.

<TEXT>
   To the dismay of Democrats, President Bush has
compiled a long list of successful vetoes and in the process has
rewritten the civics-book definition of how to use them.
   Bush has wielded his veto pen 16 times, and he has never been
overridden in a Congress ruled by Democrats. Just as importantly,
the veto - and threats of a veto - have helped the president wrest
compromises from reluctant lawmakers.
   Bush's winning streak remained intact today as the Senate
narrowly sustained his rejection of a major civil rights bill.
Supporters of the measure conceded in advance that they lacked the
two-thirds majority needed to overturn the veto, but they came
close. The vote was 66-34, just one vote short.
   ``Of the many vetoes of President George Bush, this may well be
the unkindest and ungentlest yet,'' United Auto Workers President
Owen Bieber complained Tuesday.
   Over the last three decades, only Gerald R. Ford had a higher
veto rate, and he had a quarter of his vetoes overridden.
   Bush is using his veto power differently than many presidents
who employed the veto simply to kill unwanted legislation or bills
they deemed unconstitutional.
   In large measure, Bush uses vetoes to force compromises from
Congress. It is a tactic that makes the White House a player at the
bargaining table as bills move through the House and Senate.
   ``He has wielded the veto much less as a public relations
weapon, much more as a quiet instrument of influence in the
Congress,'' said American Enterprise Institute analyst Norman
Ornstein.
   ``Richard Nixon often used to veto bills at press conferences,
making a statement as much as anything else,'' Ornstein said.
``George Bush does it in a much more understated way.''
   In dealing with lawmakers, Bush has a big problem. He has the
smallest share of his own party members in Congress of any newly
elected president in history.
   With a divided government, Bush does not have the clout to push
a legislative program through Congress. Yet, there is enough GOP
strength to sustain his vetoes when Republicans stick together.
   ``When you have two houses against you, you have no leverage,
the odds are heavy against you,'' said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. ``So you've got to use a sledgehammer going in
that says, `We won't accept this.'''
   In his day, Ronald Reagan coyly refused to say whether he would
veto a bill. Bush does it all the time, while also carefully
spelling out options to make a bill acceptable.
   ``You try to get as much change as you can before a bill is
passed,'' Fitzwater said. ``So by signaling early that you're going
to veto, you tell them they need to seriously consider
compromise.''
   Bush established the pattern with his very first veto. Democrats
wanted to raise the minimum hourly wage to $4.55 over three years.
Bush said that was excessive and threatened a veto. Congress
approved the increase anyway and Bush rejected the bill. When he
was sustained, lawmakers and the White House struck a compromise.
   Tom Cronin, a political scientist at Stanford University, said
the president is using his vetoes ``quite intelligently.''
   ``He doesn't try to use the veto in a mean-spirited way. He just
sees it as an instrument to try to get people back to the
bargaining table,'' Cronin said.
   Bush vetoed three appropriations bill to force the deletion of
abortion funding from otherwise acceptable measures. Three other
measures, including one dealing with Chinese students, were
rejected to prevent what he viewed as an erosion of presidential
authority.
   Most recently, Bush vetoed a short-term spending resolution and
shut down the government to force progress on deficit-reduction
negotiations. Monday's veto of the civil rights legislation came
only after months of negotiations between the White House and
Congress.
   The president coupled his veto with a copy of a civil rights
bill he would sign, but civil rights advocates denounced it as a
sham.
   Democrats routinely decry Bush's vetoes but they haven't been
able to stop him.
   Early in the administration, there was an understanding among
Bush, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., Fitzwater said.
   ``They agreed that the only way they would have any clout in the
Congress is if, when it was called for, they could hang together,''
the spokesman said.
   ``Basically, on most of these vetoes we've been able to hold
together. It gets more dicey when you can't hold all your
Republicans. You've got to try to pick up some Democrats.''

<HEAD>House Approves Volunteer Service Bill Despite Complaints Over Cost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pushing aside complaints about its cost, the
House on Wednesday approved and sent President Bush a $287 million
bill aimed at encouraging volunteerism and community service.
   The compromise National and Community Service Act passed the
House on a 235-186 vote. The Senate approved the agreement last
week after it emerged from a House and Senate conference.
   Rep. Gus Hawkins, D-Calif., the retiring chairman of the House
Education and Labor Committee, said he had been assured Bush would
sign the bill.
   But it was condemned by Republicans, who said it amounted to
unwarranted spending at a time when Congress is struggling with a
tax bill and existing programs for children and the poor lack
mone.
   ``Has the Congress of the United States gone bonkers?'' said
Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis.
   ``People wonder why the American public is upset with the
Congress of the United States. I'll tell you why they're upset -
because they don't understand this kind of drunkenness with new
bureaucracy and new spending,'' he said.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said the bill would encouraging a new
spirit of service among young people.
   ``This bill at least for now signals a change from the `Me
Generation' of the 1980s to a community service ethic I hope will
pervade America in the 1990s,'' he said.
   The bill authorizes spending $62 million in the current fiscal
year, $105 million in fiscal 1992 and $120 million in fiscal 1993
for national and community service programs.
   A part of the measure is a $5 million authorization to begin a
``Thousand Points of Light Foundation'' to encourage volunteerism,
taking its name from Bush's phrase for volunteers.
   Among the key elements:
   - A new part-time program encouraging community service by young
people, established through schools and community organizations
such as the YMCA or the United Way. It would encourage adults to
volunteer in schools and community-based service programs.
   Money would go in grants to state education agencies, which
would distribute it to schools and service groups.
   - An expansion of youth corps programs to increase fulltime
service opportunities. Young people would be put in teams to work
on projects cleaning the environment, helping the hungry and
homeless and aiding the poor. Some 60 conservation or youth corps
programs now are operating locally.
   - A program to encourage colleges to make community service
programs available to their students.
   - A greatly reduced version of a civilian national service corps
proposed two years ago by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Chuck Robb,
D-Va. It establishes a test program providing $1,000 for
higher-education assistance or a home down payment in exchange for
a year of part-time civilian service.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Gag Order on Lawyers, Defendants in Sheriff's Drug
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered participants in the trial
of seven sheriff's deputies accused of skimming drug cash not to
talk to the news media after one lawyer brought up what prosecutors
called an irrelevant issue.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie issued the gag order
Tuesday, telling lawyers and defendants not talk to reporters about
anything with a ``substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing
this proceeding.''
   The deputies are charged with conspiracy, theft, racketeering
and tax fraud for allegedly stealing more than $1.4 million in
confiscated drug money over a two-year period. They are all on
suspension.
   Defense attorney Harland Braun, who represents Deputy Daniel
Garner, had told reporters his client would testify the CIA used
stolen drug money to covertly fund Nicaraguan rebels in the 1980s.
   He would not elaborate on how that related to the case.
   Braun made the same claim Tuesday in filing a motion opposing
the gag order. Rafeedie accused him of seeking to get inflammatory
material on the public record.
   Prosecutors asked the judge to omit CIA evidence about drug
money, saying it was irrelevant. Rafeedie did not immediately rule
on the request but said he agreed in principle.
   The government's chief witness testified Tuesday that deputies
were warned their homes would be searched by federal agents
investigating the skimming allegations.
   Former Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Sobel said he learned about the
searches in 1989 and warned the deputies, who were members of his
narcotics unit.
   ``I told everyone on the crew,'' Sobel said. ``I told them I had
just gotten information that someone ... was being worked, and that
they should be careful.''
   Sobel also testified that members of the Southwest Task Force, a
multiagency narcotics unit, severely beat a drug suspect in 1987.
   Sobel, who entered a plea bargain with prosecutors, said he was
allowed to retire from the force as a 20-year veteran with a $1,500
monthly pension.
   H pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy and tax evasion charges
and faces a possible eight years in prison.

   Soldiers in the desert find
creature comforts any way they can. A water bag is turned into a
shower. A 55-gallon drum and a block of ice converts into a cooler.
An overturned stretcher is a card table.
   They may have no choice about being in a scorching desert, but
the troops try small touches to make their hardscrabble home as
comfortable as possible.
   ``This is either the world's biggest beach or the world's
biggest ash tray,'' said Pvt. Scott Tenhagen, 19, of the 92nd Field
Artillery.
   ``We're waiting for our grass to grow, but since we don't have a
lawn mower, we hope it doesn't,'' Tenhagen, of Burlington, Ky.,
said from his tent.
   The division, normally based in the arid lands of central Texas
at Fort Hood, has been encamped in Saudi Arabia's fierce desert for
10 days. The 2nd Platoon calls its area ``Six Flags Over Saudi
Arabia,'' although it hardly looks like an amusement park.
   Their olive-colored military tents are one of the few green
things sprouting from a tortured landscape that supports only the
hardiest camels, goats and sheep.
   ``These guys really know how to adapt. They'll do anything they
can to make life a little easier,'' said Lt. William Moore, 23, of
Orange County, Calif.
   The platoon has erected wooden mail boxes outside their tent
flaps. Inside, a section of canvas serves as wall-to-wall carpet to
cover the sand. Gear is stored in cardboard boxes that once
contained food rations.
   Nearby, the group has created a shower with a water bag hung
from a tent pole and protected by two ponchos. A couple of planks
serves a a floor.
   For recreation, the soldiers have a football, a volleyball court
and playing cards.
   Soldiers are getting two hot meals a day and eat field rations
for lunch. They say they're getting plenty of water and the mail is
getting through.
   There's also training to keep them occupied.
   One morning, the battery practiced setting up two multiple
launch rocket systems. The system uses radar to track incoming
shells, then plots the trajectory back to its source so a rocket
will hit it.
   The system is touted as faster, deadlier and more accurate than
conventional artillery. Each system can fire 12 rockets in 36
seconds.
   The radar-guided system is accurate to within 24 yards of where
incoming rounds are fired from.
   ``If you have a rocket land within 24 meters (yards), commit
your soul to God,'' said Warrant Officer Francisco Merced, 36, a
Dary, Ind. native who operates the system.

   Corruption charges won't be filed
against an asemblywoman whose office was searched at the beginning
of a long-running FBI investigation at the state Capitol, federal
prosecutors said.
   But a legislative aide and a former aide were accused by a
federal grand jury Tuesday of shaking down FBI undercover agents in
exchange for help with legislation. They are the seventh and eighth
people charged so far in the FBI's five-year probe.
   The assemblywoman from Los Angeles, Gwen Moore, chairs the
Assembly Utilitiesaand Commerce Committee and is the author of
special-interest bills that figured prominently in the
investigation, U.S. Attorney David Levi said.
   The evidence, ``when viewed in its entirety,'' did not warrant
any charges against Moore, Levi said.
   Moore's former top aide, Tyrone Netters, was indicted by the
grand jury on nine counts, accusing him of racketeering, bribery,
extortion, conspiracy, money laundering and filing a false income
tax return.
   Netters, who now works for the Assembly Rules Committee, was
placed on administrative leave Tuesday, said Bob Connelly, the
Assembly's chief administrative officer.
   Darryl Freeman, a former Assembly aide and lobbyist, was
indicted on conspiracy and extortion charges.
   Moore, who has represented a Los Angeles area district since
1978, said Levi's announcement made Tuesday a ``happy day for me
and my family.''
   ``For more than two years I have fully and completely cooperated
with the FBI in its investigations,'' Moore said. ``I knew I had
done absolutely nothing wrong and today that was confirmed by the
U.S. attorney.''
   Moore voluntarily testified before a federal grand jury in
September.
   If convicted, Netters faces up to 163 years in prison and a $3.2
million fine and Freeman up to 40 years in prison and a $500,000
fine.
   The indictment also seeks repayment of nearly $15,000 that
Netters allegedly received from FBI undercover agents.

<HEAD>China Says It's Out of Serious Economic Slump</HEAD>

   China has pulled its economy out of a serious
slump by pumping more funds into money-losing state factories and
building up inventories, according to official statistics released
Wednesday.
   Industrial output grew 5 percent in the third quarter of the
year from 1989's third quarter, including a 7.5 percent jump in
September, a spokesman for the State Statistical Bureau, Zhang
Zhongji, told a news conference.
   Chinese industry went into a slump last year after two years of
reduced state credit and purchases. Millions of small factories
shut down and even some large state factories furloughed portions
of their work forces.
   Worried about possible social unrest, the govenrment this year
loosened limits on bank loans and resumed some construction
projects.
   Zhang said the government spent $8.4 billion in subsidies to
money-losing factories and $4.2 billion in price subsidies to
control inflation during the first nine months of the year.
   Inflation remains at about 2 percent, and liberal economists
have argued that the economy is healthy enough to resume the
process of replacing central planning with market forces.
   However, top leaders in the ruling Communist Party remain in
debate over the issue. They have been unable to reach agreement on
a key document setting forth the next five years' economic program.
   The government subsidies helped restart production, but much of
the new output simply went into warehouses. Zhang said state
factories piled up inventories worth $25.3 billion by the end of
September, 50 percent larger than their inventories one year
earlier.
   Overall profits at state factories fell 57.9 percent, and
profits at state-owned stores fell 73.7 percent, Zhang said.
One-third of all state factories actually lost money, for total
losses of $4.2 billion during the first nine months of the year.
   Zhang blamed sluggish consumer demand for the state sector's
poor showing. However, earlier official reports have noted the tiny
private sector and collectively owned factories in rural areas have
consistently outperformed the state sector regardless of market
conditions.
   About 5.6 percent of the work force is officially classed as
unemployed, but Western economists say the figure could be much
higher.
   Despite these problems, Zhang said, ``The economy is developing
toward a more favorable direction.'' He predicted increases in
production and construction from October through December.

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter
apparently is getting along well with his new colleague Thurgood
Marshall, despite Marshall's biting comment about Souter's
appointment last July.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, speaking to students at George
Washington law school Tuesday, said Souter and Marshall have
established a good rapport.
   ``They have met and they're getting along. There's no reason
they shouldn't. They're both very likeable people,'' Scalia said.
   When Souter, a previously obscure New Hampshire judge, was
picked by President Bush for the high court in July, Marshall
hardly was enthused.
   In a televised interview, Marshall said he had never heard of
Souter and said of Bush, ``I just don't understand what he is
doing. This last appointment is the epitome of what he's doing. I
think somebody's calling his shots.''
   Scalia, responding to a question after delivering his lecture,
said he also had not heard of Souter prior to the nomination and
that's not surprising.
   ``If I had heard of him, it would be extraordinary,'' Scalia
said. ``Why would one expect federal judges to have heard of state
supreme court justices? If they are good judges, there is no reason
why they are not deserving of consideration for the Supreme Court.'
   Souter, who replaced retired Justice William J. Brennan, shook
hands with Marshall at the new justice's swearing-in ceremony on
Oct. 9. They had met for the first time only moments before.
   While describing himself as a moderate conservative, Souter has
expressed a high regard for Brennan and Marshall, both leading
liberals.
   According to Souter's close friend, New Hampshire lawyer Tom
Rath, Souter has called Marshall ``one of the giants of the
century.''
   Rath told reporters that Souter ``believes Thurgood Marshall as
a man, as a person, has made a tremendous contribution to this
country.''

   Freed from a mud-and-rock prison, Humphrey
the wandering humpback whale headed toward the sea, thanks in part
to the same song that lured him to open water during his famous
visit five years ago.
   As thousands of onlookers cheered, the 40-foot, 45-ton whale
floated away Tuesday from the shallows where he became beached a
day earlier.
   Rescuers banged pipes to keep Humphrey away from shore and
played tape recordings of whale sounds. The tapes, amplified with
special underwater equipment, were of humpbacks feeding.
   A Coast Guard vessel and a boat with volunteers from the
California Marine Mammal Center followed the leviathan as he made
his way toward the sea. They quit trailing him at dark.
   Two Coast Guard boats carrying volunteers from the center
resumed looking for Humphrey this morning, but no one spotted him.
   ``If he's not sighted, I think it would be safe to say he went
out to sea,'' said Petty Officer Bryan Bender.
   Humphrey last was seen near the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge, about five miles from where he had been beached and five
more miles to the Golden Gate Bridge.
   ``At least he's headed in the right direction,'' said center
spokeswoman Denize Springer.
   Rescuers also played whale sounds to lure Humphrey back to the
Pacific in the fall of 1985 after his celebrated 25-day voyage
through San Francisco Bay and other inland waters.
   Since then, Humphrey has been spotted in the ocean near San
Francisco every August or September. Biologists identify him
through tail markings that show a unique pattern, like a
fingerprint.
   On Tuesday, he drew a crowd of thousands to a cove near
Candlestick Park where he lay beached beside rocks bearing a
no-trespassing sign.
   Marine biologists, veterinarians and Coast Guardsmen nudged
Humphrey with their hands, splashed him with buckets of water,
towed him with a harness and used an air compressor to suck mud
from below him.
   ``Essentially we were trying to tease him off that mud rock,''
said Frank Griffith of the Marine Mammal Center.
   ``There's no amount of human beings that you could put out there
to push him off like you'd push a car down the street. If he's
stuck on the bottom by mud suction, you couldn't move him unless he
puts some effort into moving himself.''
   As afternoon high tide rolled in, Humphrey budged a bit from the
mud, flipping his fins, raising his tail and blowing water through
his spout as the crowd cheered.
   A short while later, Humphrey got stuck again, but with more
work he freed himself.
   Nearly 200 children from nearby Bret Harte Elementary School
watched Humphrey's return.
   ``The children are very worried. They wonder how he can survive.
They said we should all get together and push him,'' said Swaraj
Gujral, a fifth-grade teacher. ``I think he likes it here. He went
away but he left his heart in San Francisco.''

<TEXT>
   A study has found no extra leukemia deaths among
young people living near nuclear plants in France, in contrast to
reports from Britain.
   Scientists studied cancer deaths between 1968 and 1987 among
people younger than age 25 who lived near six nuclear power or
reprocessing plants.
   The researchers focused on populations living at distances of
less than 3.1 miles, 3.1 to 6.2 miles, 6.2 miles to 8.1 miles, and
8.1 miles to 9.9 miles.
   Researchers found more deaths from Hodgkin's disease than
expected, but said the difference was not statistically
significant.
   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by researchers at the Gustave Roussy Institute in Villejuif,
France.
   Previous reports found more leukemia deaths than expected in
people younger than 25 who lived near the Sellafield nuclear
reprocessing plant in England and the Dounreay nuclear complex in
Scotland.
   Those results may be due to higher discharges of radioactive
material than in France or other factors such as infections, the
French researchers speculated.
   In September, National Cancer Institute researchers said they
found no extra cancer risk in or near counties with nuclear
installations in the United States. The study did not assess risk
in more limited areas around the plants.

   Older women can now get pregnant after menopause
with the help of a method of test-tube fertilization that bypasses
one of the seemingly absolute barriers of biology.
   With this technique, doctors remove eggs from a healthy donor,
fertilize them in a lab dish with sperm and then implant them in
the infertile woman's womb.
   Its developers say the new method should allow healthy women to
routinely get pregnant and give birth after the change of life,
even when they are in their 40s, 50s and perhaps 60s.
   ``The menopausal woman can have a family using this
technology,'' said Dr. Mark V. Sauer of the University of Southern
California, who was among the first to offer the method.
   Of course, because the mother does not provide the egg, she is
not the genetic parent of her baby. Nonetheless, after she receives
the fertilized egg, she undergoes a normal pregnancy and delivery.
   Sauer's clinic charges $8,000 for each fertilization. In
addition, couples must pay $1,500 to the egg donor.
   This novel approach represents a way to circumvent the shutdown
of the ovaries, usually around age 50, that ordinarily represents
the end of a woman's reproductive life. But not any longer.
   ``The limits on the childbearing years are now anyone's guess,''
wrote Dr. Marcia Angell, executive editor of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   ``Perhaps they will have more to do with the stamina required
for labor and 2 a.m. feedings than with reproductive function.''
   Sauer reported his findings in Thursday's issue of the journal.
It was the second report in two days offering the hope of pregnancy
for infertile women.
   In Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association,
doctors reported that a new device that opens blocked fallopian
tubes with a tiny balloon can offer a simpler and cheaper method
for helping some infertile women become pregnant than previously
available.
   The implantation technique reported by Sauer has gone into
widespread use among menopausal clients of fertility clinics across
the United States during the past two years.
   Among the first treated was a 42-year-old patient of Sauer from
El Monte, Calif The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
lost the use of her ovaries after she underwent chemotherapy for
cancer four years ago.
   Her test-tube baby, a girl, was born eight months ago.
   ``I didn't think I would ever be pregnant when my ovaries quit
working,'' she said. ``I was so happy. The baby seems like a
miracle to me.''
   Last week, she received the fertilized egg of what she hopes
will be her second child.
   Sauer said that up to 10 percent of women go through menopause
naturally by age 40. In his report, he described attempts to
achieve pregnancy in seven women in their early 40s.
   After giving the women hormone treatments to prepare their wombs
for pregnancy, doctors fertilized eggs from three donors and
implanted them. Six pregnancies were established. One ended in
miscarriage, and one was stillborn. Five normal babies were born,
including a pair of twins.
   Sauer said the success rate appears to be about three times as
high as in ordinary in vitro fertilizations, a technique that has
become widely used during the past decade to help infertile
couples. Typically, eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries,
fertilized outside her body and then put into her womb.
   Sauer said he believes the donated eggs work better because they
come from young women at the peak of their fertility and because
the recipients have not been hormonally stimulated to produce their
own eggs.
   It is possible that women approaching menopause could preserve
their own eggs for implantation, but freezing human eggs is still
experimental and it's unclear if it would work, doctors said.
   Dr. Howard Jones of Eastern Virginia Medical School, who
performed the nation's first successful in vitro fertilization,
said he has achieved pregnancies in 16 post-menopausal women over
age 40 using the same techniques.
   ``The key thing here is the donor eggs,'' Jones said. ``The eggs
are not as old as the mother. The pregnancies behave according to
the eggs rather than the mother.''
   Sauer said the major limit to the technique is the health of the
mother, not her age. Women in their 50s who are free of heart
disease, diabetes and other ailments may still be good candidates
for pregnancy, and having children after 60 is possible though
unlikely.
   The technique reported in the Journal of the American Medical
Association is designed for a particular type of blockage, present
among only 10 percent of the estimated 1 million American women who
have blocked fallopian tubes. The procedure, which requires neither
surgery nor general anesthesia, is similar to the use of balloons
to open heart patients' clogged arteries.

   A couple of police officers exasperated by
drug dealing in their patrol area came up an idea they said closed
some drug operations - at least during the lunch hour.
   Officers Mike Sharp and Brian Blosmo started the ``lunch bunch''
last summer in neighborhoods where residents complained of drug
dealing.
   The uniformed officers pulled out lawn chairs and had picnic
lunches on front lawns.
   ``Our first intent was for the drug dealers to see us,'' Sharp
said.
   Sharp, Blosmo and other officers, honored Tuesday by the City
Council for the idea, said suspected drug dealers did see them and
closed up shop.
   ``They shut the doors and closed the windows,'' Sharp said.
   The officers said the lunches also provided a chance for
neighborhood residents to interact with police.
   ``It gave people an opportunity to come out and talk to us and
find out that we're not all that bad,'' Sharp said.

   Saudi Arabia's king today denied reports that the Saudis are
willing to accept territorial concessions to defuse the Persian
Gulf crisis, and a U.S. senator said Iraq and the multinational
force are headed for war.
   Thirty-two British hostages freed in Iraq on Tuesday returned to
London today, and 14 Americans released in Baghdad the same day
also headed home.
   One of the British hostages who was held at a strategic site in
Iraq said he and his fellow captives briefly rioted when their
guards refused to provide them with enough food or adequate toilet
facilities.
   Nine of the Americans arrived in London today and will fly home
Thursday. The other five flew to New York on a flight with a
stopover in Amsterdam.
   The nine Americans had little to say on arrival at Heathrow
Airport. ``They asked us very nicely not to say anything,'' said
Peter Timko of Pennsylvania.
   John Charlton, 19, from Tampa, Fla., said the detainees didn't
have much warning before they were told they could leave.
   ``It was just a few hours, pretty sudden. ... I am happy to be
home in the West. We were treated fine as diplomats,'' said
Charlton. ``I was never scared, except the invasion was a little
scary, but that's about it.''
   Iraq's ambassador to France said all French citizens in Iraq and
occupied Kuwait could return to France within two days.
   Iraq's parliament on Tuesday endorsed Saddam Hussein's proposal
to allow all French citizens in the country to leave, a gesture
seen in Paris as an attempt to divide the West's anti-Iraqi
alliance.
   The more than 300 French citizens in Iraq and Kuwait are among
hundreds of Westerners prohibited from leaving by Saddam since his
invasion of the emirate Aug. 2. Many are being held at strategic
installations to deter a possible attack by the U.S.-dominated
multinational force in the Persian Gulf.
   The Pentagon on Tuesday said the United States might send more
troops to the region than the 240,000 who are there now or en
route.
   ``The fact is that we're headed toward conflict,'' Sen. Richard
Lugar, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
during an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   ``If the Iraqis don't move they're likely to be pushed out,
peace is not at hand,'' the Indiana Republican said in response to
Saudi comments over the weekend that some interpreted as a peace
overture to Saddam.
   King Fahd - for the second time in two days - today denied the
Saudis would be willing to accept territorial concessions to Iraq
to prevent war.
   The king stressed that the Saudis demand an unconditional Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait and the return to power in the oil-rich
emirate of exiled Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who was deposed in
the invasion nearly 12 weeks ago.
   ``The decisive and clear stand that the government of the
kingdom set toward the Iraqi aggression on the state of Kuwait is
firm and unchangeable, clear and unambigious,'' Fahd said in a
statement distributed by the official Saudi Press Agency, monitored
in Bahrain.
   On Sunday Prince Sultan, the Saudi defense minister, was
reported to have raised the possibility of allowing Iraq to keep
some Kuwaiti territory if it withdraws its hundreds of thousands of
troops.
   Regarding the hostages, a jetliner landed outside London today
with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and the 32 Britons
whose release from Iraq he had helped secure a day earlier.
   Jim Thompson, one of the freed Britons, told reporters on the
flight that he and 14 other foreigners held as human shields at an
Iraqi armaments factory had rioted to protest bad conditions.
   Thompson, 50, an engineering company manager, said they were
held without enough food and with no proper toilets.
   He did not say if any Americans were in the group.
   ``We were in really bad shape. We told the guards, unless you do
something ... we are going to have a disturbance,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   He said when nothing was done, they tore down fences, broke
windows, painted anti-Saddam remarks on walls and shouted
anti-Saddam slogans until guards forced them back into their rooms
at gunpoint.
   He did not say where the factory was located or when the
incident happened.
   The number of Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait is estimated at
1,000.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington on Tuesday that of the 14 American men released Tuesday,
six are ailing, two have critically ill relatives at home and six
are students.
   She said 63 Americans with health problems have not been allowed
to leave.
   Iraq's ambassador to Paris said all the French hostages held in
Iraq and occupied Kuwait could be flown home within two days.
   Ambassador Abdul Razzak al-Hachimi told journalists that an
Iraqi Airways plane could evacuate the hostages held in both
countries.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said on Tuesday that U.S.
officials were considering sending more troops to the region. That
could give Operation Desert Shield a far greater offensive
capability.
   Williams said the joint chiefs chairman, Gen. Colin L. Powell
was consulting with U.S. and Saudi officials on possibly expanding
the deployment.

<HEAD>Gov't Proposes System For Black Majority Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government offered a model
for a new political system Wednesday, proposing a two-chamber
parliament that would allow some black rule but preserve
substantial power for whites.
   The report by the President's Council, a body controlled by the
governing National Party, could serve as the basis for the
white-led government's bargaining position in planned negotiations
on a new constitution.
   President F.W. de Klerk has called for negotiations with black
and white opposition groups on a new constitution that would end
apartheid and give the black majority national voting rights.
   He also has spoken of a system of ``checks and balances'' in
which all citizens have equal voting rights but the different
branches of government hold power over each other to prevent
domination by individuals or groups.
   Under the model presented Wednesday, the two chambers of
Parliament would have equal power, and major legislation would
require approval from both.
   One chamberwould be elected by voters throughout the country
with all citizens having an equal vote.
   At present, most observers believe the African National Congress
would get the most votes under such a system.
   The second chamber would be set up on an ethnic or regional
basis, the report said. Whites and other minorities would be
assured a certain number of seats and would be able to exercise
veto power on any major policy issue.
   There was no immediate reaction from the ANC or other
anti-apartheid organizations. However, they are certain to oppose a
second chamber based on race. Most anti-apartheid groups demand a
simple one-man, one-vote system with no special concessions to any
minority group.
   The President's Council's report also recommended a bill of
rights and the establishment of a National Conflict Management
System to resolve disputes.
   The council is a presidential advisory commission.
   Since May, the government and the ANC, the largest black
opposition group, have been meeting to try to clear the way for
full-scale constitutional negotiations.
   De Klerk has promised to dismantle the apartheid system of
segregation and white dominance. But he says a straight one-man,
one-vote system would merely replace white domination with black
domination.
   During a visit to the Netherlands, de Klerk said Tuesday he
would be willing to serve in a government headed by ANC leader
Nelson Mandela.
   ``I'll serve under any president elected under the new
constitution,'' de Klerk said.
   However, he said any coalition between his National Party and
the ANC was unlikely.
   De Klerk has until 1994 to draw up a new constitution or face
another election under the current constitution, which bars the 30
million blacks from voting.
   Under apartheid, the 5 million whites dominate politics and the
economy. The main institutions still segregated are neighborhoods,
public schools and the politics. Many other facilities have been
integrated in recent years.
   Wednesday's report said partitioning South Africa into separate
black and white countries was a ``last resort, only to be
contemplated when all other options have failed.''
   The report acknowledged problems with the government's
decades-old plans to establish 10 ``independent'' black homelands.
It said only one of the 10 was ``economically viable,'' and none of
the four that accepted nominal independence had established
``legitimacy.''
   The homelands, which comprise 13 percent of South African
territory, were designed to give blacks political rights in tribal
territory but prevent their participation in national South African
politics. Four have been declared independent, but only South
Africa recognizes their sovereignty.

   Democratic congressional leaders said today
they had dropped their demand for a surtax on the wealthy,
apparently clearing the way to a deficit-reduction plan acceptable
to President Bush and most members of Congress.
   ``We're going to get an agreement this week,'' said House
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., ``Today, I hope. This week, I'm
sure.''
   The deficit-reduction plan coming into focus would, according to
one Democratic leader:
   -Raise the top income-tax rate on the wealthiest Americans from
the current 28 percent to 31 percent.
   -Phase out the personal exemption, now $2,050 per person, for
the well-to-do while reducing the deductions they can claim by 3
percent.
   The income levels at which the exemption and deduction changes
would apply had not been finalized. But it appeared likely that
deductions would be reduced for people earning more than $300,000
yearly.
   The emerging deal also appeared to avert a possible, partial
shutdown of government services at midnight.
   With the Democrats' shift, Congress seemed likely to approve by
Saturday a five-year measure raising taxes on gasoline by about 5
cents a gallon while boosting levies on cigarettes, alcohol and
airline tickets.
   Projected increases in Medicare spending would be reduced by
somewhat more than $40 billion, and other cuts would be made in a
broad range of benefit programs, including those affecting veterans
and farmers.
   Of the dropped demand for a surtax on the wealthy, Foley said,
``It appears this is not something the administration will
support.''
   Asked if the new proposalwas likely to contain the higher top
tax rate, the exemption phaseout and the deduction limitations,
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``That may be
the outcome.''
   Just Tuesday, about half of the House's Democrats indicated at a
closed meeting that they preferred a plan placing a 7.5 percent
surtax on people earning $1 million or more a year.
   But on Wednesday, Democrats said that with election day less
than two weeks off they decided it was time for a budget agreement
to be struck and for Congress to adjourn.
   ``Members have a feeling it's time to bring this Congress to a
close,'' said one top Democrat. ``We've debated the issues for a
long time. The time has come for a decision.''
   Put another way, Rep. Tom Downey, R-N.Y., said, ``It's one thing
to tax the people's pocketbooks and it's another thing to tax their
patience.''
   Oddly, signs that Democrats were ready to drop the surtax began
surfacing even as some House Republicans were indicating a possible
softening of their own opposition. ``It's a possible,'' House GOP
Leader Robert Michel of Illinois said of the surtax after a party
caucus.
   Michel and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas went to
the White House Tuesday night for what GOP sources said was an
attempt to sell Bush on the surtax. Today, however, Dole spokesman
Walter Riker said the visit had been held to discuss ``whether they
should pull the plug on the whole process'' - whether to break off
negotiations.
   ``In Senator Dole's view, the surtax is a dead issue,'' Riker
said. He said Dole believes that the longer negotiations continue,
the greater likelihood there is of a package that relies more on
tax increases and less on spending restraint.
   The dispute over precisely how to put new taxes on the rich
became the most difficult issue in the effort by lawmakers and the
White House to pare $250 billion from the budget deficit over five
years.
   Added to a package of cuts in military spending and interest
expenses, the deficit would fall by a total of $500 billion over
that period.
   Instead of a surtax, Republicans proposed the limitation on
deductions. Until this week, that alternative had been supported by
only about half the House's majority Democrats.
   Proceeds from higher taxes on the wealthy would be used to
moderate proposed increases in the gasoline tax - likely about five
cents rather than the nine cents passed by the Senate - and in
patients' Medicare expenses.
   Lawmakers were under pressure from two deadlines: With the Nov.
6 elections less than two weeks away, leaders want to adjourn for
the year by the weekend, and the government's authority to spend
money for non-essential services expires at midnight.
   Bush has signed four stopgap spending extensions since the
budget year began Oct. 1. He said Tuesday he had not decided
whether he would go along with a fifth in the absence of a
deficit-cutting agreement. Congress has yet to enact any of the 13
annual appropriation bills for the new year.
   Bush, campaigning for Republicans in New England, declared
himself ``so frustrated by Congress' inability to do anything ... I
don't know what I'm going to do.'' He urged Republicans to get
behind a compromise agreement.
   Democrats were doing the same.
   Although Bush has abandoned his campaign pledge not to raise
taxes, many GOP allies in the House are sticking to theirs; they
want no part of any tax increase. Thus, Democrats were left with
the choice of pushing through a deficit-reduction package of tax
increases and spending restraints whose basic outlines have been
endorsed by Bush, or drafting their own plan and hoping for
reluctant support from senators and the presiden.
   Tuesday's negotiations indicated Democrats had abandoned hopes
of winning support for a Republican-backed plan and are ready to
move with their own.
   Any package likely to emerge from continuing negotiations will
include tax increases on tobacco, alcoholic beverages, plane
tickets, and expensive cars, furs and boats. Higher-income wage
earners would have to pay more for Medicare coverage; retirees
would have to pick up a bigger share of the cost of insurance
covering doctors' bills.
   Democrats had said a surtax was the preferable way to tax the
wealthy because it is easily understood and would be clearly viewed
as taking back a portion of national wealth that flowed to the
richest Americans during the last decade. Republicans insisted a
surtax would be an invitation to special interests to begin
petitioning Congress for special exclusions, and that within a few
years the only recourse would be to pay for those exclusions by
raising all tax rates.

   Atlantis today passed a fueling test
that found the space shuttle to be free of dangerous hydrogen
leaks, clearing the way for a November liftoff.
   ``We have a very tight vehicle at the pad,'' said NASA spokesman
Bruce Buckingham. ``There are no indications of any excess leakage
of liquid hydrogen.''
   A small amount of hydrogen escaped into Atlantis' engine
compartment, but was well within allowable limits, Buckingham said.
No leakage was evident in fuel lines between the orbiter and
external tank, the site of previous problems.
   ``We feel the leaks have been fixed,'' Buckingham said. ``The
engineers are very happy.''
   NASA began pumping liquid hydrogen into Atlants' new external
tank early this afternoon, six hours later than planned. Engineers
needed extra time to evaluate a broken fuel line sensor and a small
dent in another line, which they decided would not affect the
hourlong test.
   Atlantis, like Columbia, has been grounded by hydrogen leaks all
summer. NASA plans to send Atlantis on a classified Pentagon
mission around Nov. 9 or 10. A launch date will be set following a
flight readiness review that begins Monday.
   Columbia, its astronomy flight postponed four times, will
undergo a fueling test Monday.
   NASA is counting on a successful outcome to maintain the
momentum from Discovery's smooth flight earlier this month and
reduce mistakes by workers.
   Several mishaps occurred during the 5{-month gap between shuttle
missions that ended with Discovery's liftoff Oct. 6 with a
sun-exploring satellite.
   For example, technicians left a beam to bang around Atlantis'
engine compartment when the shuttle was hoisted to an upright
position on Oct. 3. Two days later, another beam crashed to the
floor while being moved by a forklift.
   ``I hate to say it, but I think some of it has to do with the
fact we're not flying and we're not paying as close attention as we
should be,'' said Conrad Nagel, an official in charge of Atlantis'
pre-launch operations.
   ``When you have delays and problems and people are not in their
normal routine of processing, I think it has an effect.''
   NASA officials said they will try to launch Columbia by the end
of the year if Monday's fueling test goes well or if any remaining
leaks can be corrected quickly. The shuttle was to have lifted off
in May with an observatory.
   ``I don't think anybody around here feels we're on track until
Columbia flies, after Atlantis,'' said Keith Hudkins, chief of the
shuttle orbiter program.
   Since Atlantis' leaks were detected in June, NASA has replaced
the external tank, fuel lines and valve seals.
   Five days after the repairs were completed, a 9-foot aluminum
beam left inside Atlantis' engine compartment crashed into about 25
spots as the orbiter was being raised. A small section of
liquid-oxygen plumbing had to be replaced.
   To make sure no damage remained from the beam, NASA pumped
liquid oxygen into Atlantis as part of today's test. NASA officials
said no traces of oxygen were found in the engine compartment.
   In the Oct. 5 accident, workers failed to secure a 60- to
70-foot beam that is part of a sling used to raise the orbiter, and
the beam fell about 8 inches inside the assembly building. No
injuries or damage were reported.
   J.B. Kump, spokesman for Lockheed Space Operations Co., NASA's
prime contractor for shuttle processing, said disciplinary action
is being taken against workers in both cases.
   Forrest McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center, said he met
with workers last week and urged them to ``be a little bit more
aware of what we're doing.''
   Columbia's hydrogen leak, which is much more extensive than that
of Atlantis, is at least partly due to worker error. Two seals were
crushed when they were installed improperly after the shuttle's
last flight in January.

<TEXT>
   Huge boulders knocked
loose by an earthquake blocked one road into Yosemite National Park
today, and two of the three other highways leading into the park
also were closed by rockslides.
   No injuries were reported from the quake, which was felt Tuesday
night from San Francisco to Nevada and shook up casinos and hotels
in South Lake Tahoe and Reno. It registered a preliminary 5.8 on
the Richter scale, according to the United States Geological
Survey.
   Six-foot-high boulders forced the closure of Highway 120 on the
west side of the park. A three-foot section of the highway was gone
and a retaining wall was lost.
   ``It's not a big pile of small rocks, it's a small pile of big
rocks,'' U.S. Park Service ranger Kelly McClaskey said.
   A rockslide half a mile away closed Highway 140 into the park,
but that was expected to be cleaned up today, ranger Scot Bowen
said. State highway crews also were clearing away a slide on
Highway 120 on the east side of the park. A road from the south was
unaffected.
   The quake's center was in Lee Vining, a town of 400 people
northeast of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada and about
190 miles southeast of San Francisco, said Pat Jorgenson,
spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey.
   ``It was a rolling, strong jolt and lasted about 25 seconds,''
said Robin Bergmann, a resident of Manteca, about 120 miles from
Lee Vining.
   ``We had lots of calls but no reports of injury,'' said Mono
County Sheriff's Deputy Suzanne Sturdivant, who said the quake
lasted about 45 seconds.
   Elaine West, a telephone operator at Caesar's in South Lake
Tahoe, said the quake left ``a lot of frightened guests'' at the
hotel and casino.
   ``In the gift shop, things started clinking around, and that's
how the girls in the gift shop knew about it,'' she said.
   Syrena Styff, an employee at Harrah's in Reno, said guests
reported feeling dizzy but didn't immediately realize a quake had
struck.
   South Lake Tahoe is about 80 miles northwest of Lee Vining. Reno
is about 40 miles north of South Lake Tahoe.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the magnitude of a quake
according to ground motion. Every increase of one whole number
represents a tenfold increase of magnitude. A quake of 7 is capable
of widespread, heavy damage.
   The earthquake that hit Northern California on Oct. 17, 1989,
registered 7.1 and claimed 67 lives.

<TEXT>
   Factory orders for ``big-ticket'' durable
goods fell 1.7 percent in September, the government said Wednesday.
Analysts said the report foretells a further production and
employment slump in the industrial sector, which already has lost
500,000 jobs since January of 1989.
   ``It was another report indicating the economy is slowing down,
probably ... that we're in a recession - but probably indicating
the recession will be mild,'' said Elliott Platt, director of
economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a New York
securities dealer.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods - items
expected to last more than three years - totaled a seasonally
adjusted $124.9 billion last month.
   Transportation orders slid 6.8 percent to $32.8 billion, with
declines in motor vehicles more than offsetting an increase in
aircraft.
   ``The main message is that dealers are not ordering 1991 model
cars,'' said economist Cynthia Latta of DRI/McGraw-Hill in
Lexington, Mass.
   Durable goods orders have fallen three times in the last four
months and, Commerce said, the August decline was even steeper than
previously reported - down 0.8 percent rather than 0.5 percent. For
the year so far, it said, orders were off 0.5 percent compared to
the first nine months of 1989.
   Durable goods orders are a key barometer of manufacturing
industry plans for production. A decrease in orders can result in
production cutbacks and layoffs.
   In fact, the Labor Department reported earlier that 66,000
factory jobs were lost in September. Since reaching a
post-recession peak in January 1989, the manufacturing sector has
lost 500,000 jobs.
   ``The industrial sector is just muddling along,'' said Ms.
Latta. ``I expect industrial output to decline in the fourth
quarter because of a lack of orders.''
   But Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist with Fuji
Securities Inc. in Chicago, said that while the report reflects
continued softness in the manufacturing sector, it contains no
``confirming'' evidence that things will get worse.
   He noted that excluding the transportation category, orders
inched up 0.3 percent.
   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods jumped
6.3 percent to $38.2 billion but faled to regain a 9.9 percent
loss in August. While these orders often are a barometer of
business plans to expand and modernize, Platt suggested that much
of them may have come from overseas.
   ``The strength in exports probably will be one of the factors
that will keep a recession relatively mild,'' he said.
   Orders for non-electrical machinery rebounded 5.4 percent to
$22.5 billion from a 5.1 percent drop in August. Office and
computing equipment had the largest gain.
   But orders for electrical machinery fell 7.7 percent to $19.1
billion after advancing 2.2 percent the previous month. Both
communication equipment and electronic components were down
sharply.
   Primary metal orders also declined, down 0.8 percent to $11.4
billion. They had fallen 2.5 percent in August.
   The often-volatile defense orders were off 9.6 percent, to $7.6
billion, following a 12.5 percent increase the previous month.
Excluding defense, orders dropped 1.1 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods were down 3.0 percent to $124.7
billion, losing a 2.8 percent advance in August. Unfilled orders
were unchanged at $499.5 billion following a 0.3 percent loss the
previous month.

   Tractors stood dusty and idle at a Jerusalem
construction site Wednesday, and a nervous Jewish shopkeeper kept a
steak knife near his cash register.
   The scenes revealed an Israel suddenly fearful of the Arabs in
its midst after a wave of attacks on Jews. The violence prompted
the government to adopt the unusual tactic of sealing off the
occupied territories.
   Roadblocks kept Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip
out of Israel, while police swept out those left behind. Tel Aviv
police said they fielded more than 1,700 calls from Israelis
reporting on the presence of Arabs who should have stayed at home.
   The closure, ordered by Defense Minister Moshe Arens after a
wave of Arab-Jewish clashes, virtually removed the backbone of
Israel's blue-collar work force and disrupted many industries.
   Most Israelis, still shaken by the violence, were not sure the
ban would work.
   ``People are afraid,'' said Charlie Maman, a grocer in Pisgat
Zeev, a Jewish neighborhood wedged between two Arab districts of
Jerusalem.
   He showed a visitor the steak knife he put next to his cash
register. ``This is only to injure, not to kill,'' he added.
   Arab knife and hammer attacks have killed three Israelis and
injured eight more in the past four days.
   On Tuesday, an Arab was killed by gunshots in an apparent
vengeance attack, and another who stabbed and injured two unarmed
women soldiers was beaten by civilians who caught him. He died in
the hospital Wednesday.
   The atmosphere of communal violence elicited a despairing
reaction from Zohar Shemesh, a Jerusalem clothing store owner.
   ``What are we going to do, close them off? Will that work? The
solution is to get out of here, to go abroad.''
   Police Minister Roni Milo said he hoped the closure of the
territories would vacate some of Israel's more than 100,000
Arab-held jobs for Soviet immigrants.
   ``Let's not be ashamed that we want Jewish labor in the state of
Israel,'' he told Parliament.
   Many construction sites, stripped of their Arab work forces,
were almost idle. Ironically, they included housing projects being
built for Soviet immigrants, who are pouring in at a rate of 20,000
a month.
   Aharon Sapir, deputy president of the Construction Union, said
the situation was grave.
   ``We need a quick solution because the need for housing is
urgent, both for the immigrants and the population, and we don't
have the workers who can build,'' Sapir said in an interview.
   Professor Moshe Asimyonov of Tel Aviv University said that
banishing the Arabs would create an ``unsettling atmosphere'' and
damage industry, agriculture and construction, but not irrevocably.
   Israel says the ban is for a few days, until passions cool. But
if it becomes permanent, Asimyonov said, the jobless Arabs ``will
oil the wheels of the intefadeh,'' the 34-month-old Palestinian
uprising.
   Many Arabs complained that they were being penalized for the
violence of others.
   ``This is sheer starvation,'' said Shaher Saad, head of the
Workers Union Federation in the West Bank.
   After Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, it
opened its borders and Arabs became an inexpensive work force of
street sweepers, garbage collectors, waiters, cooks and
construction workers.
   But idealists anguished over the damage being done to their
vision of a Jewish state built and run by Jewish labor. Now the
idealists see their chance to reverse the trend.
   Baruch Yonin, an immigrant from Leningrad, said low salaries
deter even immigrants desperate for work.
   ``There is an absurd surrealistic situation here, where Arabs
build houses for Jews in the territories,'' said Yonin, who came
here seven months ago and works as a plumber on a construction site
in Israel.
   ``Jews need to build for Jews,'' he said. ``But everyone has to
hope to find something, a permanent job with a good salary. This
job pays very little.''
   Take-home pay on the site is about $650 a month, well under the
national average wage of $1,000.
   Still, since the closure of the territories Jerusalem's state
employment office has been flooded with calls from employers
looking for maintenance, garage, restaurant, agriculture and
supermarket workers.

<TEXT>
   At least 29 people were killed Wednesday
in clashes between Hindus and Moslems, and Prime Minister V.P.
Singh said he will seek a vote of confidence to see if his
government can survive.
   The deaths came during a nationwide strike called by the
right-wing Hindu party, whose defection has jeopardized the future
of the Singh government.
   Singh said his minority centrist government would survive
despite the loss of support from the Bharatiya Janata Party. But
other members of the prime minister's Janata Dal party were less
optimistic.
   ``Only a miracle can save this government,'' said Chandra
Shekhar, a veteran politician and frequent antagonist of Singh
within the fractured Janata Dal.
   Singh called Parliament to reconvene 10 days ahead of schedule,
on Nov. 7, and predicted he would muster the majority needed to
keep him in power.
   Reports of violence during Wednesday's strike came from
throughout the country. Clashes in Jaipur, the capital of the
western state of Rajasthan, accounted for 18 deaths, United News of
India said.
   News reports suggested the violence was sparked by clashes
between Bharatiya Janata Party activists and Moslem residents.
   The general strike was called to protest the arrest of party
president Lal Krishna Advani on Tuesday while he was leading a
fundamentalist campaign to replace a 16th-century mosque with a
Hindu temple.
   The Bharatiya Janata, or Indian People's Party, withdrew its
support for Singh's government, ostensibly to protest the arrest
and the government's vow to prevent the mosque's demolition.
   Most of the deaths were the result of either stabbings or police
shootings in dozens of towns in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat,
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh states, which are predominantly Hindu
but have large Moslem populations.
   News reports said businesses shut down and traffic stayed off
the roads in most parts of the country either in support of the
strike or for fear of violence.
   A curfew was imposed and army called out in several towns, the
reports said.
   Press Trust of India and United News of India described the
clashes as ``communal violence,'' a phrase that usually means
Hindu-Moslem clashes. Indian news media avoid giving specific
details in such cases, contending that the normally strained
religious tensions would only be heightened.
   India's Moslem population of about 105 million is the
second-largest in the world after Indonesia. But Moslems comprise
only 12 percent of the 880 million population. Hindus have an 82
percent majority.
   The news reports said about 50,000 people have been detained
across the country in preventative arrests. Such arrests are common
in India, where the law permits people to be held without charge if
the authorities believe public safety is in danger.
   ``The time has come for all secular forces to unite,
irrespective of party affiliations, for the issues which are facing
us today are larger than party consideration,'' Singh said in a
statement.
   The appeal was apparently directed at Parliament members of the
Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Congress Party in the
hope that some of them would vote for the government on Nov. 7.
   Singh needs the support of 261 members in the 522-seat lower
house of Parliament. At present he has the assured support of about
200 members.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party has 86 seats.
   Singh, who took office nearly 11 months ago, said in his
statement that in the meantime, the government will work to stop
the Hindu fundamentalists from beginning their temple construction
on Oct. 30 in Ayodhya, 300 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   At least 80 people were killed earlier this month in violence
triggered by the temple campaign.

   The Soviet Union has agreed to join a
consortium that hopes to build a large detector at the
superconducting super collider in Texas, Stony Brook University
officials said Wednesday.
   The Soviets will contribute $200 million to Empact-Texas, said
Michael Marx, a physics professor at Stony Brook who is
coordinating Empact's proposal. Others involved in the consortium
are the Grumman Corp. and Martin Marietta.
   Three consortiums are vying to build two large detectors planned
for the $8 billion atom particle smasher. Two are expected to be
selected for final approval in December.
   Among other things, the detectors will be designed to search for
the elusive ``higgs'' particle in proton-proton collisions.
Physicists believe that higgs is the origin of mass.
   Marx said about 120 Soviet scientists from 12 institutions,
including the Institute for High Energy Physics, would join the
Empact consortium.
   The Soviet agreement, signed earlier this month, is the largest
foreign commitment to the super collider to date, Stony Brook
officials said.
   The super collider, scheduled for completion in 1998, will be
housed in a 54-mile underground ring to be built south of Dallas.
It will be used to study sub-atomic matter.

<TEXT>
   The 70-year-old Soviet national trade union
organization voted today to dissolve itself and to form a voluntary
association of unions, the state news agency Tass reported.
   The meeting in Moscow coincided with a congress of miners
occurring in the Ukrainian city of Donestsk to form the nation's
first independent trade union.
   During their weeklong conference the miners plan to consider a
national strike to enforce their economic and political demands.
The congress is an outgrowth of the nationwide coal strike that
gripped the country in July 1989.
   With President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in attendance, 2,500
delegates to the Central Council of Trade Unions meeting in Moscow
voted the council out of existence and formed an alliance of
industrial and regional unions, Tass said.
   The council was an umbrella organization of trade unions
representing an estimated 140 million Soviet workers.
   It was not clear whether the miners' union would be allowed or
would want to join the newly reformed national trade union
organization.
   Delegates to the national congress in Moscow, being held two
years ahead of scheduled, moved quickly to break with the Communist
economic system.
   Deputy chief Vladimir Scherbakov said the council ``increasingly
lagged behind profound changes, acute and complex processes of real
life, which inevitably prompted a crisis of trust in its
structures.'' He said the revamped organization would no longer
demand a monopoly on workers' loyalty.
   Tass said the decision to hold the official conference two years
early was ``extraordinary.'' No official reason was given, but it
appeared designed to coincide with the miners' meeting in Donetsk.
   The open bidding for workers' hearts, in a country that once
hailed itself as a worker's paradise, demonstrated the political
importance that organizers place on blue-collar labor as the
political and economic system opens up.
   The miners' strikes, which started in the summer of 1989, began
to protest working and living conditions and shortages of such
basics as soap and medical care. The miners quickly escalated their
demands to include regional economic autonomy for the main mine
regions, such as the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia and the Don River
Basin in the Ukraine.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov persuaded the miners to return
to work, promising to meet most of their demands. But most of the
promises remain unfulfilled, an issue that has spurred new strikes.
   The strike committees, meeting at their first conference in
Donetsk last summer, demanded the promises be honored. They also
called for Ryzhkov's government to resign and urged workers in
other industries to cut their ties with the government and official
unions.
   The delegates at that congress proposed forming an independent
trade union, but postponed its actual formation until now to allow
the new government of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin to deal
with the economic crisis.

   After 120 pounds of frozen, cajun-style
beef disappeared from a soup kitchen, a nearby food warehouse
replaced it within a week with fresh roast beef.
   Edwards Food Warehouse donated the 100 pounds of meat after a
company executive read about the theft last week.
   The donated beef made a hearty stew that fed the whole lunch
crowd Monday, soup kitchen coordinator David O'Sullivan said.
Leftovers probably will make enough for another full meal, he said.
   ``It's always reassuring when we have a problem the community
will rally around and help us out,'' O'Sullivan said.
   No arrests have been made.
   The soup kitchen feeds about 250 people each day, O'Sullivan
said.

   A flea market browser was surprised at her
own luck when she plunked down $3 for an odd-looking picture that
turned out to be a Peter Max silk screen worth $800.
   Max's penciled signature on the print of a neon-colored man in a
brightly-hued coat was obscured by the frame.
   ``This may be the grand finale in the bargain department,'' said
Lisa Smith, who got the last laugh on critics who dismiss flea
markets and thrift sales as a dumping ground for junk.
   Smith found the print amid the bric-a-brac of Tampa's Junior
League Thrift Sale in September.
   ``I was surprised someone would donate this to a thrift sale,''
she said. Tampa art dealer Lois Berghoff, who appraised the print,
guessed the untitled work was created about 1972.
   Max, who is enjoying renewed popularity, created more than 300
limited edition graphics. He also has published 29 books, designed
160 posters and fashioned logos for more than 50 corporations.
   His style is distinguished by vivid colors and fairy-like
characters associated with the so-called ``pop art'' of the late
1960s and early 1970s.

   Congress should safeguard workers' rights
before employers begin widespread screening for genetic diseases,
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said Wednesday.
   Gore released a report by the Office of Technology Assessment
which showed that few U.S. companies now require genetic testing of
their employees and applicants. But he said Congress should move
now, before the practice becomes more widespread, to head off
discrimination against workers on the basis of genetic
characteristics.
   ``To a large extent there are few clear guidelines on how these
tests can be used or how workers can be protected from having their
rights violated,'' said Gore, who requested the report.
   Genetic screening can help save lives by alerting an employer to
a worker's susceptibility to a particular occupational exposure,
the report noted.
   But it expressed concern that employers might deny jobs to
anyone whose tests show they are at risk of genetic disease and
could prove a burden to a company's health insurance program.
   Genetic tests are available to detect sickle cell anemia, cystic
fibrosis, Huntington's disease, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular
dystrophy and other diseases. Future tests could screen for such
things as hypertension, dyslexia, Alzheimer's disease and cancer,
the report said.
   The OTA's 1989 survey of the nation's 500 largest companies
produced responses from 330 companies. Twelve reported current use
of genetic monitoring or screening and eight others said they had
conducted these tests at some time since 1970.
   A similar OTA survey in 1982 elicited responses from 366
companies, with six saying these tests were in current use and 19
indicating past use.
   Margaret Anderson, project director, said it was not clear why
more companies are not testing, but she said cost, ranging from
$200 to $980 a person, is probably a factor.

   After an out-of-court settlement, the Supreme
Court has dismissed a case stemming from a $300 million lawsuit by
a California woman who said the Taiwanese government plotted her
husband's 1984 murder.
   The justices had been asked by lawyers for both sides to drop
the case, in which Taiwan's government had argued that American
courts lack the authority to hear such a suit.
   Helen Liu of Daly City, Calif., had contended in her suit that
the government of Taiwan, formally named the Republic of China,
``carefully orchestrated'' a cover-up of a ``terrorist plan and
scheme'' to silence her husband, Henry Liu.
   Gerard Harper, a lawyer for Mrs. Liu, said the Supreme Court
case was dropped after Mrs. Liu and the government of Taiwan
reached a settlement in which the government admitted no wrongdoing
but paid her an amount of money.
   Harper said the size of the payment is confidential.
   The high court's order dismissing the case was dated Sept. 28.
   Born in China, Henry Liu fled to Taiwan in 1949. He lived there
until emigrating to the United States in 1967, and became a U.S.
citizen in 1974.
   A historian and journalist, Liu had written several articles
critical of Taiwan's government.
   Liu was gunned down at his home by members of the Bamboo Union,
an organized crime group based in Taiwan. Gangleader Chen Chi-Li
confessed to plotting Liu's murder, and implicated two government
officials, including Wong Hsi-Ling, director of Taiwan's Defense
Intelligence Bureau.
   Wong was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. One of his
aides, Chen Hu-Men, was sentenced to 30 months in prison.
   Mrs. Liu's suit said her husband began receiving threats in
1973, and that his published works were confiscated and suppressed
in Taiwan.
   ``The threats did not daunt Liu, who continued to endorse a
return to democratic rule in Taiwan,'' Mrs. Liu's lawyers had told
the high court. ``He paid for those views with his life.''
   Mrs. Liu's suit was filed in late 1985, nearly a year after the
criminal convictions stemming from her husband's murder.
   Taiwan's government sought dismissal of the suit, arguing that
the Act of State doctrine precluded U.S. courts from pursuing Mrs.
Liu's theory of a government murder plot.
   A federal trial judge dismissed the suit but the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it last December.

<HEAD>Judge's Bans News Organizations From Interviewing Jurors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two news organizations are challenging a
judge's decision to bar reporters from calling jurors who delivered
a $12.5 million verdict against white supremacist Tom Metzger.
   Multnomah County Circuit Judge Ancer L. Haggerty issued the
ruling at the end of the trial late Monday, but said he would hold
another hearing Friday to consider the challenge filed by lawyers
for The Oregonian and KGW-TV.
   Haggerty told reporters they would be held in contempt of court
if they tried to interview jurors about the verdict against
Metzger, leader of White Aryan Resistance, his son, John, and
others.
   The Metzgers were sued by the family of Mulugeta Seraw, 27, a
black man from Ethiopia who was beaten to death by racist
skinheads. The jury decided that Metzger incited Seraw's killers
and was responsible for his death in November 1988.
   Before dismissing the jury, Haggerty asked jurors if any wished
to appear at a news conference that evening. He later told
reporters that no jurors wished to be involved.
   Haggerty said he told the jurors they were free to discuss the
case, but that reporters could not call them.
   Charles Hinkle, attorney for The Oregonian, said the order
violated state and federal constitutional free press guarantees. He
also said the order was invalid because it was not in writing and
because reporters did not have a chance to be heard before it was
issued.
   Portland lawyer Elden M. Rosenthal, who helped represent Seraw's
estate, said he thought the judge's order was appropriate.
   ``I think these jurors have gone far beyond the call of public
service,'' Rosenthal said.
   He said he felt jurors in a highly controversial case ought to
be allowed to ``melt back into the population'' at the end of their
service.
   Intense security required for the two-week trial cost the
Portland Police Bureau almost $300,000 in overtime, but the full
cost of security still is being calculated and won't be known for
several days, spokesman Dave Simpson said Wednesday.
   Concern about violence stemmed in part from the bombing of the
federal courthouse in San Diego on Sept. 15. A previously unknown
white supremacist group claimed responsibility and threatened
further violence if the lawsuit against Metzger were not dropped.
   Morris Dees, the Southern Poverty Law Center attorney who sued
Metzger, received a letter the same day threatening him. Police
said Metzger received 20 death threat a day at his Portland
message center.
   Police maintained 24-hour protection of Dees, Rosenthal and the
judge.
   ``The Portland police deserve bouquets,'' Dees said. ``I mean
I've had five or six guys around the clock since I hit this town
two weeks ago.''
   Metzger and his son spurned police offers and used their own
bodyguards outside court, said Deputy Chief Dan Noelle.

<HEAD>Missouri Appeals Court Ruling Expands Drug Search Powers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Missouri Court of Appeals has
expanded the power of police to make drug raids in response to an
operation in which agents used mail-order records to nab more than
100 accused marijuana growers.
   The court Tuesday overturned a decision by Linn County Circuit
Judge Robert DeVoy, who ruled that police had unconstitutionally
searched the Prairie Hill home of Lisa Diane Shuck as part of
operation ``green merchant.''
   Shuck and another resident of the house, William Phegley, were
charged in October 1989 with possession and production of
marijuana. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 17 years in
prison.
   Police obtained the warrant using records showing Phegley had
bought hydroponic equipment, which enables plants to grow in water,
from a company that advertises in ``High Times'' magazine.
   The New York-based magazine caters to marijuana growers and
advocates legalizing marijuana.
   Police also presented evidence for the warrant that Shuck had
draped blankets over her windows and used four times more
electricity than her neighbors.
   Officers found more than 70 marijuana plants, marijuana seeds
and growing equipment during the raid.
   Judges William E. Turnage and Donald L. Manford said in the
ruling the search was reasonable.
   But Judge Robert W. Berrey warned in a dissent that police
``must be vigilant not to trample on our Bill of Rights to cure a
momentary ill of our time.
   ``If the majority should prevail, no hydroponic horticulturist
or African violet grower will be safe from unwanted intrusions,''
Berrey wrote.
   Jack Lukehart, Shuck's attorney, said he would appeal the
decision to the state Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Pravda Editor Offered to Resign, But Says He Was Told To Stay On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editor of the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda, facing a hostile staff and slumping circulation, said
Wednesday he had offered to resign but was told by Mikhail
Gorbachev and the Politburo to stay on.
   Ivan T. Frolov, who was appointed editor of Pravda a year ago,
told a news conference that he offered to quit as a result of
``insulting'' remarks about him by Pravda staff members.
   Frolov also released figures showing a stunning drop in the
circulation of the newspaper that for decades was viewed as the
most important in the country.
   As of Oct. 1, Pravda had received only 504,000 subscriptions for
next year, a huge drop from its current circulation of 7.7 million.
The circulation drive, originally scheduled to end Oct. 30, has
been extended to Nov. 15.
   Frolov did not say what insulting remarks the staff had made,
but Pravda employees have said they are dissatisfied with Frolov's
traditionalist views and his ties to hard-line politicians.
   The staffers voted three weeks ago to ask the party's Central
Committee to review the newspaper's leadership. Frolov has called
the vote a ``mini-coup attempt'' against him.
   Under Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost'' or greater openness,
other newspapers regularly publish articles on controversial
political or historical themes, or on popular culture.
   Although Pravda has begun to print some articles critical of
government officials and policies, it has changed less than other
periodicals and is one of the most orthodox Communist newspapers.
   Its official owner is the party Central Committee, and it
regularly carries front-page editorials praising and explaining
party positions.
   Frolov attributed Pravda's plummeting circulation both to an
increase in its cover price, which is rising from about 9 to 17
cents, and to its ownership by the party, which is blamed by many
Soviets for the country's disintegrating economy and political
structure.
   ``People's attitudes toward Pravda are connected with their
attitudes toward the party,'' he said.
   Frolov said he offered his resignation on Tuesday to the party's
highest bodies, the Central Committee secretariat and Politburo,
headed by Gorbachev, who is the party leader as well as president
of the country.
   ``I said I could not and did not want to work at this newspaper
anymore,'' Frolov said.
   He added that he raised the issue himself, and received a
``negative response'' to his offer to step down.
   ``I received full support from the Politburo and the secretariat
and, of course, I must and I will work at Pravda,'' he said.
   Frolov said he also received permission from the party leaders
to set up a Pravda Association that could publish other newspapers,
sell advertising and start new ventures to raise profits and offset
Pravda's declining revenues.
   He said Pravda now makes a profit of about $18 million dollars a
year, but probably would become unprofitable if its circulation
slipped below 5 million copies.
   Given the current status of the subscription drive, it appears
unlikely that Pravda will reach the 5 million level. But Frolov
said he was confident it would continue to be published and have a
sufficient circulation to ``remain a world-class newspaper.''
   Pravda comes out seven days a week. Each issue is either six or
eight pages long, with no advertising.

<TEXT>
   Vandals are destroying
geysers and hot springs in Yellowstone National Park by throwing
boulders, old shoes and other debris into the thermal channels,
officials said Wednesday.
   Even the famous Old Faithful geyser has been hit.
   In the most recent case, someone earlier this month damaged the
``Rustic'' group of geysers near Heart Lake in the southern part of
the park by clogging them with rocks and kicking in their conical
rims.
   At least one of the geysers, the Rustic Geyser Vent, has been
reduced to a trickle and may never erupt normally again, park
officials say.
   ``It's just so senseless. There could have been no reason to do
it except to just destroy the area and we have no idea why someone
would want to do that,'' park spokeswoman Marsha Karle said. ``They
are irreplaceable and priceless treasures.''
   Since the park was created in 1872 the curious occasionally have
tossed logs and rocks into geysers to watch the debris blow
sky-high in the next eruption of steam and hot water from deep
underground.
   Reports from the early days of Yellowstone tell of others who
have even taken axes to some of the thermal features to chip
mementos, and some people have carved their initials into the
geyser cones of mineral deposits.
   ``For as long as people have been around, they've been throwing
things into Old Faithful and other thermal features,'' Karle said.
``We've had trouble before with people throwing coins, small rocks,
chicken bones, rifle shells, cigarette butts and bottles.''
   Last May, a Billings, Mont., man was fined $525 for throwing a
chemical into the ``Giantess'' geyser near Old Faithful.
   While the force of erupting geysers sometimes ejects the debris,
Karle said some become so plugged they won't erupt again.
   Park rangers do their best to retrieve garbage from the vents,
but most is too deep.
   ``Yellowstone's thermal features are fragile and easily damaged.
Walking on them, carving or defacing them or removing souvenir
pieces of formations destroys decades or centuries of intricate
natural processes,'' Karle said.
   The roughly 10,000 geysers and hot springs that draw visitors to
the nation's oldest national park ``take many, many years to build
up and be created and just a few minutes for someone to destroy,''
she said.

<HEAD>Imminent Decisions Could Signal Bush Intentions in Gulf Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush faces key decisions in the
coming weeks that could signal whether he anticipates a lengthy
standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein or wants American forces
prepared to attack.
   Among the questions facing Bush:
   -Whether to add more troops and firepower to the U.S. deployment
in the Mideast, now at 220,000 and scheduled to peak at 240,000 in
three weeks.
   -Whether to withdraw some units that are not essential to
defending Saudi Arabia, a decision which could serve to assuage
growing public concern about the prospects of war without
diminishing the force's defensive capabilities.
   -Approving a Pentagon troop rotation plan, now in the draft
stages, that sources said should be ready for White House review in
a week or so.
   -Whether to use his authority to extend 90-day Reserve call-ups
for another 90 days.
   The U.S. deployment reached a symbolic juncture Wednesday with
the arrival in Saudi Arabia of the final elements of the 11th Air
Defense Brigade from Fort Bliss in Texas. It was the last combat
unit scheduled for deployment in the region, Pentagon sources said.
   The only remaining troops scheduled to be sent to the area are
in support units. They should all arrive in the next three weeks,
bringing the total deployment to 240,000, said the sources,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   ``As of now we're not planning for any additional buildup. We're
planning to sustain the force that is present,'' one of the
Pentagon sources said.
   But Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
has discussed with ground commanders the possibility of changing
the force size. He is due back from Saudi Arabia late Thursday.
   If Powell recommended, and Bush approved, adding to the force,
Pentagon sources said the likely additions would be heavy armor
units from the United States, Europe or both. Such orders also
would necessitate sending several additional support units into the
region as well, the sources said.
   ``That would ratchet up the pressure on Saddam and give the
president the option of surprise if he decided to go on the
offensive,'' one of the sources said. ``If a decision has been made
to kick him out, then adding to the force first would make it more
efficient in terms of loss of life.''
   But, barring some development in the crisis that would prompt
United Nations support for an offensive, Pentagon sources and
military analysts think it far more likely that Bush will tinker
with the force - but not dramatically, signaling continued resolve
to allow economic sanctions against Iraq to take hold.
   ``We would have to double the force there to make an offensive
palatable from a military standpoint,'' said Lawrence J. Korb, a
former assistant defense secretary for manpower in the Reagan
administration. ``I don't think that is very likely at all.''
   By bringing some non-essential units home, Bush could ``show
that we are prepared to stay there for the long haul'' as long as
he articulated the reasons for the moves, Korb said. ``Saddam is
waiting to see how long we can hold both the support of the
American Congress and our U.N. coalition together. I'd set up a
rotation plan but basically keep my troop level about where it
is.''
   If Powell recommends withdrawing forces, the sources said the
82nd Airborne Division, the first ground unit to reach Saudi
Arabia, likely would be the first unit brought home.
   Such a move would not affect the defensive capability of the
U.S.-led multinational forces, the sources said. But withdrawing
the paratroopers ``would signal that we are going to hunker down
and wait right along with Saddam,'' the source said.
   The withdrawal of even a few thousand troops from the Mideast
could also help Bush, whom Korb said ``is obviously not as popular
as he was when he started this.''
   Said one of the Pentagon sources: ``We'd look good bringing some
people home for Christmas, even if in the big scheme of things it
didn't amount to much.''
   At the same time, ``We have to be very careful about what kind
of signal we send because perception is as important as reality in
that part of the world and it's easy for things to get confused in
translation,'' this Pentagon official said. ``Whether the decision
is status quo, reduce or add, the White House is going to have to
explain that and ensure that the diplomatic signals that are
connected with the decisions are properly read by Saddam Hussein.''
   The Pentagon sources said draft rotation plans call for
six-month rotations for most units, which would mean the first
large-scale substitutions beginning in February. Some units that
are harder to replace ``may have to spend more time in country than
we or they would like,'' one of the sources said.
   The sequence of the rotations is still under discussion, this
source said. ``We know the soldiers and families are waiting with
bated breath but there are some very complicated questions to be
resolved.''
   When heavy armor units are rotated, the Pentagon would have to
decide whether to leave tanks and other equipment in Saudi Arabia
or bring them home with the troops. Current thinking is to bring
the equipment home, a huge logistical headache, because otherwise
the troops would be unable to train at their bases for possible
return to Saudi Arabia.
   Overall cutbacks in the military further complicate rotation
planning. For example, the Army alone has to plan for 1.1 million
moves in the next 12 months in a force numbering just over 700,000.

   The Bush administration has put Syria on
notice it has a ``special responsibility'' to curb violence in
areas of Lebanon under Syrian control, the State Department said
Wednesday.
   With the U.S. Embassy in Beirut closed, the United States is
assessing blame for the mounting death toll since Gen. Michel Aoun,
the last major Christian holdout, gave up his struggle against
Syrian forces 11 days ago.
   The most recent prominent victim was Dany Chamoun, a Christian
leader who also opposed Syrian influence. He, his wife and two
small children were slain in their Beirut apartment last weekend.
No one has claimed responsibility.
   ``We have seen the many press reports of atrocities carried out
in East Beirut since the surrender of Gen. Aoun,'' Margaret D.
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said. ``We do not have
firsthand knowledge which could confirm those reports. However, the
reports themselves are enough to shock and horrify,''
   The U.S. official added: ``if these reports are true, whoever is
responsible the United States would condemn them in the strongest
terms.''
   The Bush administration had urged Aoun to end his resistance.
Aoun has taken refuge in the French embassy.
   ``We have told the Syrians they have a special responsibility,
given their control over parts of Lebanon, to ensure that such
abuses do not take place in areas under their control,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said, reading from a prepared statement. ``There is no
ambiguity in the message we have sent to Syria on this point.''
   Syria, which has influence over the Lebanese government headed
by President Elias Hrawi, is a key Arab ally of the United States
in its campaign against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. Some 4,000
Syrian troops are in Saudi Arabia to help defend the kingdom
against Iraqi attack.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly had
met with Syrian Ambassador Walid al-Moualem here while Edward
Djerejian, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, had met with Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Shara in Damascus.
   Also, the spokeswoman said, Kelly met Tuesday and several times
before then with the Lebanese ambassador, Nassib Lahoud.

<HEAD>Polish President Vetoes Bill Allowing Sale of Land to Foreigners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wojciech Jaruzelski, using the veto for
the first time since he became president, has rejected legislation
that would have allowed foreigners to buy land in Poland from the
state.
   The former Communist Party leader, who became president in July
1989 and will leave office after the Nov. 25 elections, generally
has not used his presidential powers to block the Solidarity-led
government's reforms.
   The land management law deeply divided Parliament. Many
lawmakers fear Poland will be bought out by Western investors,
particularly from neighboring Germany, who are attracted to the
relatively low cost of Polish property.
   The state news agency PAP, which reported the veto, did not say
what specific objections Jaruzelski raised.
   The Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, initially rejected
allowing the purchase of state-owned land by foreigners. In late
September, however, the Senate passed a version of the bill that
permitted sales to non-Poles if approved by the Interior Ministry.
That version was endorsed by the Sejm.
   Senators argued that Western investors would hesitate to
establish badly needed new companies in Poland if they could not
have the security of owning their own property.
   They also noted the anomaly that privately owned land can be
sold to foreigners, but government-owned land cannot.
   Under the Communist government that ruled Poland from the end of
World War II until last year, and in the economic upheaval that
followed the Communists' dismissal, few Poles have accumulated
enough capital to make large investments.

<HEAD>IRA Bomb Attacks Using `Collaborators' Leave Seven Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The IRA killed at least
seven people Wednesday in simultaneous attacks on two border
checkpoints. The attackers forced alleged ``collaborators'' to
drive bomb-laden cars at the targets.
   The dead were six soldiers and one civilian.
   Hospitals reported 35 other people injured, including two
9-month-old babies, in the pre-dawn explosions about 70 miles apart
near Londonderry and Newry.Both checkpoints were on the border
between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
   Patsy Gillespie, a man who was forced to drive to the
Londonderry checkpoint while his family was held at gunpoint, was
missing and feared dead. A body was discovered in that area at
sunset.
   A third attack, on an army base in Omagh, failed when the bomb
did not go off, police said.
   Police in the Irish Republic said five men were detained just
across the border from the checkpoint near Londonderry where one
bomb killed five soldiers.
   Another soldier was killed at the security checkpoint in Newry.
   The seven deaths brought to 16 the number of people killed so
far this month in the British province's sectarian and political
violence.
   The Irish Republican Army, whih is fighting to drive the
British out of the province and unite it with the Irish Republic,
claimed responsibility and said the men they forced to drive were
``collaborators'' who had performed construction work for the
security forces.
   At Newry, the IRA took over a house, held the family at gunpoint
and forced a 65-year-old man to drive a bomb to the checkpoint,
police said.
   At the checkpoint, the man jumped out of the vehicle and
shouted: ``There's a bomb in the van!'' but the device exploded
before police, soldiers and the driver had time to get clear,
police said.
   One of the man's legs was broken.
   In Londonderry, a sobbing Kathleen Gillespie told reporters that
armed men broke into the house before midnight, took her
42-year-old husband away and released the rest of the family about
four hours later.
   ``They assured me that nobody was going to come to any harm and
that my husband would be back in half an hour,'' she said.
   ``I'm so angry, I'm so angry,'' she wept. ``This is the second
time they've done this to me.'' She said armed men once
commandeered her car, filled it with 300 pounds of explosives and
made her husband drive it to a military installation. ``At least
that time he came home,'' she said.
   She said her husband was not a construction worker but was
employed by the Ministry of Defense doing odd jobs.
   The army said the five members of King's Regiment killed in the
Londonderry attack were Lance Cpl. Stephen Burrows, 30 and Kingsmen
Stephen Beacham, 20, Paul Worrall, 23, Vincent Scott, 21, and David
Sweeney.
   Police identified the soldier slain at Newry as Pvt. Cyril
Smith, 21, of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Irish Rangers.
   Altnagelvin Hospital outside Londonderry admitted 13 men and 12
women wounded in the explosions, five in serious condition.
   A spokesman said 19 were released after treatment and two were
to undergo surgery.
   Ten people were treated for minor injuries at Daisy Hill
Hospital in Newry, said administrator Mervyn Ferris.
   In Dungannon, the body of Patrick Francis Hughes, 60, was found
in a burned-out taxi, police said. A Protestant extremist group,
the Protestant Action Force, has claimed it kidnapped a Dungannon
driver in retaliation for the slaying of a Protestant driver
outside a hospital in Belfast on Tuesday.
   Before Wednesday, eight people had died in sectarian and
political violence this month, including an IRA member and an IRA
supporter who were killed in an army ambush.

   A sheriff's deputy was shot while hanging
campaign posters in what authorities called a politically motivated
attack.
   Irving Bell, 34, underwent surgery Tuesday after being shot in
the back, abdomen and buttocks about 3 a.m. He was in critical

   House Democrats have two new poster boys in
their cloakroom off the House floor - Minority Whip Newt Gingrich
of Georgia and indicted savings and loan owner Charles H. Keating
Jr.
   ``What do these two men have in common?'' reads the caption on
the large poster featuring photos of Gingrich and Keating.
``Nothing yet. It's payback time.''
   Gingrich, whose intense partisanship has made him the Republican
Democrats most love to hate, is described in a caption under his
photo as ``the most corrupt minority whip in history.''
   That's a takeoff on the phrase Gingrich used repeatedly in
attacking former House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned last year
after an ethics investigation initiated by Gingrich.
   The poster also features the slogan: ``Make the 102nd (Congress)

   An absence of tattoos is just one of the
reasons candidate Thomas Davidson says voters should select him for
Congress over veteran incumbent Harold Ford.
   Other campaign strengths, in Davidson's view, include a fondness
for the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington'' and a claim he has
figured out who killed Laura Palmer on the TV show ``Twin Peaks.''
   ``If I get elected, I'll tell,'' said Davidson, an independent
candidate. ``That's one of my promises.''
   Ford, a Memphis Democrat, is heavily favored to win a ninth
term. In voting Nov. 6, he faces Davidson; fellow independent Issac
Richmond, a perennial candidate, and Republican Aaron Davis, a
79-year-old political newcomer.
   With his first printing of a political handout, Davidson issued

   He proposes selling Texas to Japan to cover savings and loan
losses, promises to support legislation making bingo the national
pastime and pledges to persuade TV talk show host David Letterman

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's unbroken string ofsuccessful
vetoes is built largely around a strategy of using the veto as a
club to force concessions from Congress, say White House officials
and political analysts.
   Bush kept his record intact Wednesday when the Senate, by a
one-vote margin, upheld his veto of a major civil rights bill. The
White House hailed the vote and prodded Congress anew to enact
Bush's version of the bill.
   Bush has issued 16 vetoes; all have been sustained in the
Democratic-controlled Congress. Over the last three decades, only
Gerald R. Ford issued vetoes more frequently - and a quarter of his
were overridden.
   Bush uses the power of the veto differently from many
presidents, who employed the veto simply to kill unwanted
legislation and bills they deemed unconstitutional.
   In large measure, Bush uses vetoes to force compromises from
Congress. It is a tactic that makes the White House a player at the
bargaining table as bills move through the House and Senate.
   ``He has wielded the veto much less as a public relations
weapon, much more as a quiet instrument of influence in the
Congress,'' said American Enterprise Institute analyst Norman
Ornstein.
   ``Richard Nixon often used to veto bills at press conferences,
making a statement as much as anything else,'' Ornstein said.
``George Bush does it in a much more understated way.''
   In dealing with lawmakers, Bush has a big problem. He has the
smallest share of his own party members in Congress of any newly
elected president in history.
   With such a divided government, Bush does not have the clout to
push a legislative program through Congress. Yet, there is enough
GOP strength to sustain his vetoes when Republicans stick together.
   ``When you have two houses against you, you have no leverage,
the odds are heavy against you,'' said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. ``So you've got to use a sledgehammer going in
that says, `We won't accept this.'''
   In his day, Ronald Reagan coyly refused to say whether he would
veto a bill. Bush does it all the time, while also carefully
spelling out options to make a bill acceptable.
   ``You try to get as much change as you can before a bill is
passed,'' Fitzwater said. ``So by signaling early that you're going
to veto, you tell them they need to seriously consider
compromise.''
   Bush established the pattern with his very first veto. Democrats
wanted to raise the minimum hourly wage to $4.55 over three years.
Bush said that was excessive and threatened a veto. Congress
approved the increase anyway and Bush rejected the bill. When he
was sustained, lawmakers and the White House struck a compromise.
   Tom Cronin, a political scientist at Stanford University, said
the president is using his vetoes ``quite intelligently.''
   ``He doesn't try to use the veto in a mean-spirited way. He just
sees it as an instrument to try to get people back to the
bargaining table,'' Cronin said.
   Bush vetoed three appropriations bill to force the deletion of
abortion financing from otherwise acceptable measures. Three other
measures, including one dealing with Chinese students, were
rejected to prevent what he viewed as an erosion of presidential
authority.
   Most recently, Bush vetoed a short-term spending resolution and
partially
   shut down the government to force progress on deficit-reduction
negotiations. Monday's veto of the civil rights legislation came
only after months of negotiations between the White House and
Congress.
   The president coupled his veto with a copy of a civil rights
bill he would sign, but civil rights advocates denounced it as a
sham.
   Democrats routinely decry Bush's vetoes but they haven't been
able to stop him.
   Early in the adiinistration, there was an understanding among
Bush, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., Fitzwater said.
   ``They agreed that the only way they would have any clout in the
Congress is if, when it was called for, they could hang together,''
the spokesman said.
   ``Basically, on most of these vetoes we've been able to hold
together. It gets more dicey when you can't hold all your
Republicans. You've got to try to pick up some Democrats.''

   The Vatican confirmed Wednesday that Vietnam
has agreed to a visit by a high-level delegation next month for
talks on church-state relations in the communist country.
   The delegation will be led by Cardinal Roger Etchegaray of
France, who heads the Vatican's Justice and Peace Commission, and
include two of the Vatican's Asian experts.
   The visit, sought for some time by the Vatican, was first
reported Tuesday by Vietnam's official news agency. The Vatican
said the delegation will leave on Nov. 6.
   The invitation by the Hanoi government is considered a major
step forward in Vatican-Vietnamese relations.
   While restrictions on Roman Catholics and members of other
religions have eased in recent years, Vatican officials say a
number of issues must be resolved. They include the appointment of
archbishops for vacant posts in Hanoi, Hue and Ho Chi Minh City.
   There are about 4 million to 5 million Catholics among Vietnam's
largely Buddhist population of 63 million.
   Last year, Cardinal Etchegaray made the first official visit by
a Vatican representative to Vietnam since the 1975 communist
takeover. He returned in May for the funeral of the archbishop of
Hanoi.

<HEAD>Israel Bombs Suspected PLO Bases in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rare night attack, Israeli warplanes
on Wednesday bombed a suspected PLO missile base in response to
artillery attacks in Israel and its self-proclaimed ``security
zone,'' reports said.
   No casualty figures were immediately given by the Palestine
Liberation Organization or Israeli military following the 20-minute
assault around the Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the southern port
of Tyre.
   A PLO communique said four aircraft dropped bombs and strafed
positions manned by guerrillas from Fatah, the PLO's mainstream
faction headed by Yaser Arafat.
   It was the first Israel air raid into Lebanon since July 9 and
the 15th this year. Israeli officials say they have attempted to
avoid attacks in Lebanon since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   It was also the first attack since Syria, a longtime Israeli
foe, expanded its control in Lebanon by helping government troops
oust rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun almost two weeks ago.
   In Israel, the military command claimed the target was ``a
terrorist launching pad'' for Soviet-made Katyusha rockets fired
into Israel the past two weeks.
   The last of the rocket attacks was Oct. 16 when a barrage landed
in northern Israel, causing no damage or injuries. Five days
earlier, six rockets landed inside Israel's security zone in south
Lebanon, according to Israeli reports.
   Rashidiyh is about 50 miles south of Beirut and 10 miles north
of the Israeli border.
   Israel carved out the 440-square-mile security zone in 1985
during the withdrawal the bulk of its army from south Lebanon
following a three-year occupation of the region.
   Previous Israeli air raids have killed 20 people and wounded 62,
police said.
   Israel's air force usually strikes in daytime, but helicopter
gunships often range into Lebanon during night to rout guerrillas.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Lebanese police said Israeli-affiliated
militiamen killed two guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in a south Lebanon firefight.
   But the Israeli army said members of an elite paratrooper
brigade, not militiamen of the South Lebanon Army, killed the
guerrillas.
   A Lebanese police spokesman, who cannot be named under
regulations, said three other fighters of the Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah were wounded in the clash near the village of Kfar
Houneh.
   The battle occurred 15 miles north of the Israeli border, which
is deeper into Lebanon than normal for Israeli troops seeking
guerrillas.
   The Lebanese police spokesman said South Lebanon Army gunners
later pounded the area around Kfar Houneh and Hezbollah-controlled
villages of Mashghara and Maidoun.
   Hezbollah returned fire with salvoes of Katyusha rockets, he
added.
   He said a casualty report on the missile exchange was not
immediately available.

<HEAD>Administration Sets Side-Impact Crash Protection Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner on
Wednesday announced new standards to protect car occupants during
side-impact collisions, saying the regulation would prevent 500
deaths a year.
   The action ends more than a decade of haggling over how
manufacturers should reinforce cars to help riders withstand side
collisions. More people die that way than in any other kind of
automobile wreck except frontal collisions.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Skinner said at a news
conference outside the Capitol. He stood near a demonstration car
with its driver's side crushed inward and a crash dummy seated
behind the wheel in a graphic illustration of the danger of side
collisions.
   Manufacturers must meet the new standards in 10 percent of their
new cars by 1994.es to 25 percent in the 1995 mod The minimum risel
year and 40 percent in 1996. By the 1997 model year, all new cars
must comply.
   The changes will boost the average car's cost by about $50, ``a
small price to pay for the prevention of the immense loss of life
and suffering as a result of these side impacts,'' Skinner said.
   The regulation is designed to reduce deaths and serious injuries
caused by chest and pelvic injuries. About 8,000 people die and
24,000 are hurt seriously each year in side crashes.
   Rance Institute for Highway Safety said the regulation
was ``a long-overdue first step'' but was inadequate because it
excludes protections from head injuries.
   ``A substantial proportion of the most serious injuries that
occur in side impacts are head injuries,'' said Brian O'Neill, the
group's president.

   The editors of a weekly newspaper for Haitians
in Miami were among the five winners announced Wednesday of the
annual Maria Moors Cabot Prizes for journalism that advances
inter-American understanding.
   The editors, Marc ``Marcus'' Garcia and Elsie Etheart, are the
first Haitians to be awarded gold medals in the 52-year history of
the prizes. They founded the French- and Creole-language Haiti En
Marche in 1986 and also produce Creole radio news programs in
southern Florida.
   Other winners, to be honored in ceremonies at Columbia
University on Thursday night, were Richard Boudreaux, Los Angeles
Times bureau chief in Managua, Nicaragua; Alma Guillermoprieto,
Latin America correspondent for the New Yorker magazine and other
publications, and Huascar Cajias Kauffmann, founder and columnist
of Presencia, a daily newspaper in La Paz, Bolivia.
   The Cabot prizes, a gold medal and $1,000 to each winner, were
established by Godfrey Lowell Cabot of Boston as a memorial to his
wife. They are awarded by the trustees of Columbia on the
recommendation of the university's School of Journalism.
   Garcia and Etheart, radio journalists in Haiti in the 1970s,
were arrested and jailed in 1980 for reporting on the activities of
the secret police. They were expelled as subversives by dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier.
   Their newspaper in Miami is read in Canada and Haiti and their
news broadcasts reach nearly all the 120,000 Haitians in south
Florida.
   Boudreaux, 42, has been a reporter 20 years. He worked for The
Associated Press for 16 years in New York, Argentina, Mexico, Chile
and Bolivia before joining the Los Angeles Times.

<HEAD>Thousands Attend Chamoun Burial; Lebanon Tries to Disband Militias</HEAD>

   DEIR AL-KAMAR, Lebanon (AP) - Thousands of people, many holding
red carnations, attended the funeral Wednesday of slain Christian
leader Dany Chamoun, his wife and two young sons as they were
buried in his hometown.
   In Beirut, meanwhile, President Elias Hrawi's government held
talks with militia leaders about withdrawing their forces from the
city under a peace plan aimed at ending Lebanon's 15-year civil
war.
   Chamoun, 56, and his family were gunned down at their apartment
in Beirut's eastern suburb of Baabda on Sunday. No group has
claimed responsibility for the slayings, which were branded by both
Christian and Moslem leaders as an attempt to derail the peace
efforts.
   Chamoun, leader of the right-wing Christian National Liberal
Party, was a staunch ally of defeated rebel Gen. Michel Aoun. His
murder occured eight days after Syrian and Lebanese troops crushed
Aoun's 11-month mutiny in an eight-hour assault that left 550 dead
and more than 1,200 wounded.
   Aoun has taken refuge in the French Embassy. He had opposed the
peace plan because it provided no timetable for the withdrawal of
Syrian troops, 40,000 of whom are deployed in Lebanon.
   On Wednesday, black flags fluttered above the stone houses of
the ancient mountain town of Deir Al-Kamar, southeast of Beirut, as
the four coffins were driven to the cemetery after a four-hour
service.
   Chamoun, his wife Ingrid and their two sons, Tarek, 7, and
Julien, 5, were buried next to the tomb of his father, former
president Camille Chamoun. The elder Chamoun died a natural death
in August 1987.
   Mourners were frisked by heavily armed Druse militiamen of Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party, who control Deir Al-Kamar.
   ``Lebanon has lost a promise of peace,'' an elderly woman sobbed
at the funeral. ``May God give us strength to end this horrible war
once and for all.''
   In Beirut, the government issued a statement saying it intended
to ``spread state authority'' over the capital and its environs in
line with a peace plan endorsed by parliament Aug. 22.
   It did not set a deadline for carrying out the plan to create a
militia-free ``greater Beirut.''
   ``The army would be in charge of all streets and government
utilities. All militia offices and centers would be closed,'' said
the statement, which was issued after a three-hour meeting chaired
by Hrawi.
   Greater Beirut extends along a 15-mile coastal strip and covers
the city's eastern and southeastern suburbs.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
efforts to withdraw militias from the capital and its environs were
``now on a hot burner.''
   The development followed a visit to Beirut on Tuesday by Syrian
Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, the Syrian army chief of staff,
and the chief of the army's military intelligence in Lebanon.
   The government source said a two-man government committee
handling talks with militia leaders was instructed to ``work out
the mechanism for the militia withdrawal from greater Beirut.''
   For years, Moslem and Christian militias have battled for
control of the region.
   The source said the militia leaders ``did not register any
serious rejection of the greater Beirut plan,'' adding that it
might be implemented as early as next week.
   ``All the militias realize that if they don't withdraw
peacefully, the example of crushing rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's mutiny
would be repeated,'' the government source said.
   Meanwhile, police said the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, withdrew from positions on the former Green Line along the
eastern edge of south Beirut and handed them over to Hrawi's army.
   A police spokesman said Hezbollah maintained its stronghold in
the south Beirut slums of Bir Abed, Hay Madi and Moawad.
   Other militias that maintain strongholds within the area are the
right-wing Christian Lebanese forces of Samir Geagea, the
mainstream Shiite Amal Movement of Nabih Berri and Jumblatt's Druse
militia.

<HEAD>Syria Criticizes U.S. Aid to Israel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel-Arabs, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria on Wednesday accused the United
States of encouraging aggression by providing arms and money to
Israel.
   It was the first time the government has criticized the United
States since the two nations joined in the multinational military
buildup to counter Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Syria's
criticism, while not jeopardizing the alliance, underscores its
fragility.
   In making the criticism, Syria was reacting to a U.S.
announcement this month that it was providing Israel with
anti-missile Patriot missiles. Syrian officials are also apparently
angry over reports that U.S. officials had delayed a new U.N.
resolution to condemn Israel for the killing of 19 Palestinians by
security forces this month.
   In Wednesday's remarks, the government also called on Arabs to
``thoroughly'' discuss U.S. aid to Israel. It did not make a
specific proposal but called for ``appropriate action'' by Arabs in
response.
   The criticism came in the official Syrian Arab News Agency,
which said it was quoting an ``authoritative source.'' Such
commentaries are usually made by a ranking member of the Syrian
goverment or the ruling Baath Party, reflecting official stance.
   Syria has committed up to 15,000 troops to the multinational
military buildup in the Persian Gulf. It was the first time that
the United States and Syria, a spearhead of Arab radicalism, agreed
on a Middle East conflict in nearly 20 years.
   ``Everyday, the U.S. comes up with a new kind of support to
extend to Israel. Only very recently it decided to provide Israel
with Patriot missiles and new ammunitions,'' the source was quoted
Wednesday as saying.
   Earlier this month, U.S. officials announced they were providing
two batteries of Patriot missiles to Israel on an emergency basis.
   Wednesday's commentary also complained of U.S. aid to build
housing for Jewish immigrants.
   The source was quoted as saying that U.S. aid to Israel ``cannot
achieve peace, nor can it be aimed at achieving peace. Rather, it
strengthens aggression and occupation, and encourages invasion and
expansion.''

<HEAD>Largest Collection of AIDS Tests Yet Shows Most Infection Rates
Low</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal health officials' largest collection yet
of AIDS test surveys shows the nation's AIDS infection rates are
highest at drug treatment clinics and lowest at blood donor
centers.
   The Centers for Disease Control on Thursday will publish the
results of AIDS virus test surveys from a variety of settings
nationwide: health clinics, hospitals, the Job Corps, the military
and other places where large numbers of blood samples could be
analyzed.
   The separate surveys were considered in the absence of a
nationwide survey for infection with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS.
   ``Overall, the survey data indicated the widespread yet
extremely varied distribution of HIV,'' the CDC reported. ``By far,
the highest prevalence rates were found among persons known to be
at risk'' - specifically, gay and bisexual men and users of
intravenous drugs.
   Of nearly 150,000 AIDS cases reported in the United States, 59
percent have occurred among gay or bisexual males and 21 percent
were among IV drug abusers. An additional 7 percent of AIDS
patients fell into both categories and were counted separately.
   The HIV prevalence surveys involved testing blood samples
collected as far back as 1986. Settings ranged from military
recruitment centers to large urban hospitals to American Red Cross
blood donation centers.
   HIV infection rates in all categories were relatively low; the
worst was a median of 4.1 percent among clients at 54 drug
treatment centers - where, by definition, many are at high risk for
AIDS.
   Federal health officials estimate that between 1 million and 1.5
million Americans are infected with HIV, for an estimated national
rate of about 0.05 percent.
   One survey found the infection rate quite high in one separate
classification. ``High ... prevalences were observed among
homosexual and bisexual men in all geographic regions,'' the CDC
reported.
   At 103 sexually-transmitted-disease clinics surveyed across the
country, infection rates among gay and bisexual patients ranged
from 15 percent in two Salt Lake City clinics to 64 percent in two
Newark, N.J., clinics, with a median of 36 percent.
   Generally, infection rates were higher for men than women and
for the Northeastern and Southern states.
   More of the surveys' findings:
   - Among about 4 million American Red Cross blood donors in the
second half of 1989, the infection rate was 0.0084 percent, or
about 8 in 100,000. That indicates not just a low number of
infected people giving blood but also the removal of infected
donors from the repeat donation list.
   - Among nearly 2.5 million applicants for military service, the
infection rate was 0.12 percent, or 12 of 10,000. The low rate is
not necessarily surprising, as homosexuals and drug users are
unwelcome in the military.
   - Among 1.2 million childbearing women, the estimated national
infection rate was 0.15 percent - 15 of 10,000.
   - At 39 large, urban, acute-care hospitals where patients' blood
samples were analyzed, the median infection rate was 0.7 percent,
or 7 in 1,000. There was, however, a 70-fold variation among
individual hospitals, which ranged from 0.1 percent to 6.9 percent.
   Rates were five times higher for men than women - 1.5 percent to
0.3 percent - and somewhat higher for blacks, 1 percent, than for
whites or Hispanics, 0.7 percent.
   - In about 100,000 blood samples annually at a large diagnostic
laboratory, the HIV infection rate was 0.89 percent, or about 9 in
1,000.
   - Among an annual 60,000 Job Corps entrants - most of them
disadvantaged young people - the infection rate was 0.36 percent,
or about 4 in 1,000.
   - At the 103 sexually transmitted disease clinics, the median
infection rate for 205,000 patients was 2.2 percent.
   - At 187 women's health clinics, the median infection rate for
156,000 patients was 0.2 percent, or 2 out of 1,000.
   - In 20 metropolitan tuberculosis clinics, the median infection
rate was 3.4 percent. TB is a frequent complication of HIV
infection.

   NBC has canceled the new series ``Hull High,'' a
high school-based musical that critics liked and audiences didn't,
network officials said Wednesday.
   The last episode of the hour-long show aired Sunday night.
According to season-to-date ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co.,
``Hull High'' ranked 84th, the lowest among Big Three network
shows, with a 5.9 rating and a 10 share.
   A rating point equals 931,000 TV households. A share is the
percentage of television sets in use that are tuned to the show.
   All told, the series pilot and three episodes aired.
   On Oct. 29 the medical drama ``Lifestories,'' followed by
``Sunday Night with Larry King'' will air in the time period. On
Nov. 4, NBC will broadcast its documentary series ``The Story
Behind the Story'' in the time period.

   UNESCO's executive council Wednesday voted 38-1 to
condemn Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait for violating human
rights and trying to wipe out the national culture. Iraq cast the
only dissenting vote.
   The council asked Director-General Federico Mayor to send an
envoy to Kuwait to investigate the condition of threatened
cultural, scientific and educational institutions.
   Kuwait's chief delegate, Faisal Al Salem, testified that Iraq
had destroyed schools, pillaged museums and stolen archives since
the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Iraq's delegate, Aziz Al Hajj Ali Haidar, described the
allegations as lies or rumors, and protested the ``politicization''
of UNESCO. He said items had been moved from museums to be stored
safely in the event of bombardments.
   The resolution adopted by the council expressed concern for
``the painful losses suffered by the Kuwaiti people ...
particularly those which concern the disruption of education,
deliberate damage to scientific and cultural institutions, and the
annihilation of the Kuwaiti people's national cultural identity.''

<HEAD>Soviet Union Said to Make Nuclear Test in Barents Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union carried out a nuclear
test Wednesday at islands in the Barents Sea, despite protests from
Norway and environmental groups, a seismic institute reported.
   The blast at the Novaya Zemlya test site had a yield of 20
kilotons to 90 kilotons, the Swedish Hagfors observatory said in a
telexed statement.
   A kiloton has the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT. The
atomic bomb dropped Aug. 6, 1945, on Hiroshima, Japan, had a force
of 13 kilotons.
   Wednesday's reported blast was apparently set off in underground
rock. The islands are about 370 miles from Norwegian territory.
   ``We strongly disapprove of what the neighboring state now has
done,'' Norway's Prime Minister Jan P. Syse was quoting as saying
of the Soviet Union. His remarks were carried in the Norwegian
national news agency NTB.
   ``We are very disappointed over the blast and that the Soviet
Union has not listened to the many protests,'' Syse was quoted as
saying.
   Two environmental groups, Greenpeace and Bellona, had said the
Soviets planned to resume tests at the ecologically sensitive site
after a 2-year interruption. The islands were a primary Soviet
nuclear test site from 1958-1963.
   In September and earlier this month, the environmental groups
sent ships towards the islands in protest. Both ships were
intercepted by Soviet coast guard vessels.

   Two women who went public with the stories
of their rapes returned to the courtroom on Wednesday for closing
arguments in the fourth trial of the man they say attacked them
almost decade ago.
   Sue Kremelberg and Susan Sweetser took the unusual step of
identifying themselves publicly as rape victims earlier this year
because they were angry at how long it took their cases to go
through the court system. The women were raped in 1981.
   ``I want people to know the outrage,'' Ms. Kremelberg, a
resident of Morristown, said recently.
   Robert Percy, of Elmore, Vt., is accused of raping Ms.
Kremelberg while out on bail after raping Ms. Sweetser, an attorney
from Essex, just weeks earlier.
   In both cases, a lower court convicted Percy of raping the
women. In both cases, the Vermont Supreme Court sent the cases back
for retrial. The state's highest court recently upheld Percy's
second conviction in the Sweetser case.
   Vermont Attorney General Jeffrey Amestoy wrote a note to Ms.
Sweetser the day the court upheld the conviction.
   ``Nine years late,'' he wrote. ``May my daughters have your
courage and may they have a fairer and faster criminal justice
system.''
   Percy does not deny raping Ms. Kremelberg. But he says he was
insane at the time, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
and reliving a Vietnam War flashback.
   On Wednesday, closing arguments in the case were heard in
Windsor District Court in the second trial on her attack. Defense
attorney James Dumont pointed to psychiatrists' testimony, which he
said showed Percy was ``wounded in the brain'' by his Vietnam
experience.
   ``These are fusions, mixtures of nightmares and reality,''
Dumont said. ``He was in one world and she was in another.''
   But prosecutor Phillip Cykon said in his closing argument that
Percy was in control of his actions during the attack.
   ``The defendant was acting in a way that was his continuing
anti-social behavior. They were the actions of a defendant who was
in control,'' Cykon told jurors.
   ``The Vietnam War is not on trial here,'' Cykon added.
``Post-tramatic stress disorder alone is not enough to excuse
criminal behavior.''
   Last week, Ms. Kremelberg recounted for the jury her nine-hour
ordeal the night of Jan. 16, 1981. That evening, her stop for
diapers for her baby son and gasoline for her car brought her in
contact with Percy, an attendant at the Mansfield Garage in Stowe.
   Her voice calm, but at times in tears, Ms. Kremelberg testified
that Percy told her to back her car to the air pump, located in a
darker section of the station, because her left tire looked low.
Once at the pump, she said Percy jumped into her car.
   ``I said, `What is this, a joke? Get out of my car. I have to
get home to my husband and baby.' And he said, `Lady, shut up and
drive,' '' she said. ``At that point, he pulled a gun out, and I
was so scared I just drove.''
   Ms. Kremelberg said Percy tied her hands behind her back with
tape, blindfolded her and raped her.
   After driving to Connecticut, he raped her again. Before that
assault, she said she struggled for the gun and told Percy, ``I'd
rather be dead than do this again.'' Ms. Kremelberg escaped in
Brookfield, Conn., and police there arrested Percy.
   Percy was convicted of the rape in 1982. But the state Supreme
Court reversed the decision, giving Percy a new trial.

   Wet weather was widely scattered over the eastern half of the
nation Wednesday, with snow on part of Lake Superior's Michigan
shore, and some rivers in the Northeast ran high after a night of
heavy rain.
   Afternoon showers were scattered from southwestern Missouri
across northeastern Missouri into west-central illinois, over
northern Maine, east-central Florida, eastern Ohio and northwestern
Pennsylvania.
   Snow, rain and rain mixed with snow were scattered over western
Upper Michigan, which sits against the shore of chilly Lake
Superior.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.36 inches at Caribou, Maine; 1.29 inches at Limestone, Maine;
1.25 inches at Bangor, Maine; 1.17 inches at Houlton, Maine; and
0.91 of an inch at Mount Washington, N.H., the National Weather
Service said.
   Levels of small streams fell in the Northeast as water from
heavy rain Tuesday and during the night drained into larger rivers,
which were rising.
   Flood warnings were posted for some streams in eastern New York
state.
   The arctic coast of Alaska had blizzard conditions as wind near
35 mph with stronger gusts caused blowing and drifting snow along
with uncomfortably low wind chills. Deep drifts closed some roads
in the Barrow area, the weather service said.
   On the opposite corner of the continent, Miami warmed to a
record high of 90 degrees.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 16 in Wyoming at

   Before marking her ballot Wednesday
morning, Benazir Bhutto visited the grave of her father, Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown in a 1977 coup and
hanged two years later.
   But it was later in the day that the 37-year-old ousted prime
minister choked back tears, accusing the government of rigging her
party's overwhelming defeat.
   ``This election is a fraud,'' said Ms. Bhutto, who apparently
won one of her two races for a National Assembly seat.
   Ms. Bhutto, the first woman to lead a modern Moslem nation, also
faces corruption charges in which she could be jailed and banned
from politics if convicted. Her husband, businessman Asif Ali
Zardari, is jailed on kidnapping and extortion charges.
   Early results showed the right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance
with a strong lead over Ms. Bhutto's populist, center-left Pakistan
People's Party in races for 214 National Assembly seats. Reports
also indicated her party trailing badly in all four provinces,
especially Punjab, the most populous province and the major
battleground of the election.
   She had earlier predicted her party would win up to 120 seats in
the assembly, the lawmaking lower house of Parliament that chooses
the prime minister.
   Ms. Bhutto singled out President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who led her
Aug. 6 dismissal on charges of corruption, nepotism and
incompetence.
   ``He has shown his partiality. He is not the president of
Pakistan,'' she said at her sprawling family home in Larkana, about
500 miles southwest of the capital of Islamabad.
   She claimed the 73-year-old president advanced the campaign of
her opponents.
   ``The president has made a mockery of the elections,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto predicted she and her husband will be the subject of
a ``witch hunt'' following the elections.
   Ms. Bhutto's opponents portrayed her 20-month government as the
most corrupt in Pakistan's 43-year history and said the elections
displayed the peoples' anger.
   Since her dismissal three months ago, Ms. Bhutto had repeatedly
compared her sacking to her father's overthrow.
   After her father's death, Ms. Bhutto, the eldest of four
children, was jailed and placed under house arrest. She eventually
fled to self-imposed exile in Britain.
   Groomed for politics by her father, Ms. Bhutto returned to
Pakistan in 1986 promising to drown military dictator Gen. Mohammad
Zia ul-Haq in a tide of support from the country's poor and
downtrodden.
   For days, millions of people cloggged streets for a glimpse of
Ms. Bhutto.
   The nation's first free elections in 11 years were held after
Zia died in a mysterious plane crash in 1988 that also killed
several top Pakistani generals and U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphael.
   Her party captured the largest bloc of votes with 93 assembly
seats, but failed to win a majority.
   Even supporters say Ms. Bhutto struggled unsuccessively to make
the transition from the oppressed champion of democracy to the
leader of 110 million people, most of whom are illiterate and earn
less than $400 a year.
   Several analysts say her downfall was accelerated by her
political inexperience and what her detractors have called the
``arrogance of the Bhuttos.''
   She faces seven charges of misconduct and abuse of power before
special one-judge tribunals set up by the president.
   Conviction on any of the charges could deny Ms. Bhutto a seat in
Parliament and banish her from politics for seven years.
   Ms. Bhutto's husband faces charges of kidnapping a Pakistan-born
Briton and extorting $800,000. He has denied the charges, claiming
they were orchestrated by the government.

organizations must cease to exist.''
   Noting the Soviet Union will withdraw its troops from all
Eastern European allies by 1994, Moiseyev said: ``There will no
longer be a Warsaw Pact as a military organization.
   ``What remains is NATO. What is the purpose of the Atlantic
alliance?'' Moiseyev said, in an address at the Higher Royal
Defense Institute.
   Moiseyev expressed concern that the Western European Union, a
defense group of nine European NATO members, was being positioned
to supplant NATO. What is needed is a pan-European group that
ensures the security of East Europeans, he said.
   Moiseyev was to address a meeting of the chiefs of staff of the
16 NATO nations Thursday, and Friday meet with U.S. Gen. John
Galvin, the current NATO military commander.
   The new Soviet defense doctrine ``relies on the use of force
only as a last resort. The Warsaw Pact threatens no one in the East
or the West,'' he said, in comments translated into French by an
interpreter.
   Moiseyev said all Soviet troops will be removed from
Czechoslovakia and Hungary by 1991 and from Poland and Germany
three years later. The Soviet Union's defense will be organized
within its own boundaries only, he said.
   Moscow plans to reduce the military draft, he said. The Navy
will begin creating a partly volunteer force in 1993 and reduce the
period of obligatory military service from three years to two.
   ``I do not exclude that the draft for the other services will be
cut from two years to one,'' he added.
   The Warsaw Pact and NATO have agreed on a conventional arms
agreement, to be signed next month, involving deep cuts in battle
tanks, artillery, armored combat vehicles and combat helicopters
across Europe.

<HEAD>Chances Evaporate for Seafood-Inspection Bill</HEAD>

   The House virtually eliminated any chance of
fish inspection becoming federal law this year by approving a bill
Wednesday that sharply contrasts with companion legislation passed
by the Senate.
   ``We don't have time for a conference,'' said Agriculture
Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, who tried
unsuccessfully to win House approval of a measure similar to the
Senate's.
   ``The bill is dead,'' said a Senate aide. ``The president's veto
threat killed it.''
   No one questioned the need for inspection. With seafood
consumption up and about 60,000 people becoming ill in one year
from eating fish, even the industry wanted it.
   The problem was who should do the inspection.
   Members from the Agriculture Committee insisted that it belonged
with the Agriculture Department, which inspects meat and poultry.
   Members of the Commerce Committee and the Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee, which oversee the federal agencies related to
the fishing industry, said the farm concerns didn't know enough
about fish.
   ``We're arguing about rules and turf fights,'' said Rep. Pat
Roberts, R-Kan., a member of the agriculture committee trying to
win the inspection program for USDA. ``Or what should be surf and
turf fights in this particular instance.''
   But Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., chairman of the Merchant Marine
subcommittee on fisheries, said the agriculture committee's bill
failed to recognize that shellfish are the main cause of illness
related to eating seafood.
   He and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., argued
successfully that the FDA's current fish-inspection program, which
concentrates on shellfish, should be expanded rather than moving
the process to USDA.
   Dingell said he had a letter from Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher, Health and Human Service Louis Sullivan and White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu saying they would recommend a veto if
the Dingell-Studds plan was not adopted.
   The House approved the plan by a vote of 277-153 when it was
submitted as a substitute for de la Garza's bill.
   ``The issue is not whether we want to inspect seafood,'' said
Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La. ``The issue is whether you want the
Agriculture Committee, which may not understand the difference
between a chicken and a crawfish, to undertake that effort.''
   The Senate approved legislation last month that gives the
Agriculture Department primary responsibility by putting the
inspection process under its wing.
   The Senate bill requires the Food and Drug Administration to set
limits on the level of contamination in fish that would be
acceptable for human consumption. It instructs the Commerce
Department to monitor the waters in which fish are caught.
   Although Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, said the differences in the House and Senate
bills could be worked out in conference committee, aides said the
differences were too great to be resolved in the waning days of the
101st Congress.

<HEAD>Yelena Bonner Criticizes Gorbachev's Peace Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet dissident Yelena Bonner said
Wednesday that her late husband, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei
Sakharov, would have been uneasy with Mikhail Gorbachev winning the
same prize.
   ``I doubt that Sakharov would have approved,'' Bonner was quoted
as saying.
   The remarks, carried by the Norwegian news agency NTB, were her
first public comment on the award of the 1990 Nobel prize to the
Soviet president.
   The Oslo-based Peace Prize Committee announced Oct. 15 that
Gorbachev was selected because his reforms and glasnost policies
had helped ease international tensions.
   Most Western leaders welcomed the selection. But Bonner told NTB
that the committee had either been unaware or chose to ignore
conditions inside the Soviet Union.
   She was referring to criticism at home that some of Gorbachev's
reforms have led to ethnic rioting, food shortages and demands by
most Soviet republics for more independence from Moscow.
   ``The Nobel committee has also not taken into consideration the
fact that we are living between the second and third World Wars. In
the gulf crisis, totalitarian and democratic values are standing
against each other,'' said Bonner.
   Considering the tensions provoked by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, ``no one deserved the prize,'' she said in the agency's
translation of her remarks.
   She said it seemed strange that a Soviet leader could win a
peace prize when his country had supplied arms and military
advisers to Iraq.
   The Soviet Union has since denounced Iraq for invading Kuwait,
but it has not provided soldiers to stand beside U.S. forces
opposing Baghdad.
   Sakharov, a physicist and human rights activists, was awarded
the Nobel award in 1975. Soviet officials did not allow him to come
to Oslo for the prize that year, ut he picked it up last year
shortly before his death.
   Bonner, who was in Oslo to promote a Norwegian edition of
Sakharov's memoirs, said her husband at first trusted Gorbachev,
then lost faith.
   She said Gorbachev, shortly after reaching power in 1985, took
some positive steps such as allowing freedom of the press, freeing
such dissidents as Sakharov and withdrawing Soviet forces from
Afghanistan.
   ``But after 1988, he concentrated on building up his own
power,'' she was quoted as saying.

   A Cuban passenger plane crashed before dawn
Wednesday near an airport in eastern Cuba, killing at least 10
people and injuring 21, the official Mexican news agency Notimex
reported.
   The twin-engine, Soviet-made turboprop plane went down about
1:46 a.m. near the Antonio Maceo Airport in Santiago de Cuba, 560
miles east of Havana, the Cuban capital.
   Notimex said the flight originated in Havana and stopped in
Camaguey City en route to Santiago de Cuba, about 50 miles from the
U.S. Naval station in Guantanamo Bay.
   Ten Spanish tourists were among the passengers and at least five
of them were badly injured, according to the Spanish Embassy in
Havana. It was not immediately known whether the other Spaniards
survived the crash.
   There were no reports about the remaining passengers and crew
aboard the Cubana de Aviacion flight.
   Notimex said there were 31 passengers and two crew members on
board. It attributed the death and injury figures to Cuba's
National Information Agency.
   Prensa Latina, an official Cuban news agency, said there were 24
passengers and seven crew. It did not give casualty figures.
   Prensa Latina and Notimex said a government commission was
investigating the crash.
   On Sept. 3, 1989, a Cubana de Aviacion jetliner crashed after
takeoff in Havana, killing all 126 aboard and 26 people on the
ground.

   The national trade union organization
voted to dissolve itself Wednesday, as coal miners gathered in the
Ukraine at the same time and announced plans to create the first
mass independent union in Soviet history.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev attended the meeting in
Moscow of the government-sponsored National Congress of Trade
Unions, whose 2,500 delegates voted to reconstitute the 70-year-old
organization as a voluntary association of unions.
   Gorbachev told the meeting that he favored ``strong and
independent'' unions, the state news agency Tass reported.
   A meeting of the umbrella group, representing about 140 million
workers, was called for this week, two years ahead of schedule. The
dissolution of the organization appeared to be an effort to defuse
the emergence of the radical miners' union.
   The miners, holding their congress in the Donetsk Coal Basin,
600 miles south of Moscow, have been threatening a repeat of the
nationwide strikes that threatened to cripple the nation in July
1989.
   Miner delegates from Western Siberia, Kazakhstan and the far
north said they would not call a strike pending consideration of
their complaints by the legislature of the Russian republic, now in
session in Moscow. But they said they would create an independent
union.
   ``We will adopt a draft, and we will go from here as the first
members of an independent trade union,'' said Alexander Adanidi, a
member of Kuznetsk Basin Workers' Committee, which started the 1989
strike.
   Adanidi and other Siberian miners complained that Coal Minister
Mikhail Shchadov, whose agency owns all mines and associated
industries across the country, had tried to undermine the
legitimacy of the congress by contributing nearly $70,000 to it.
   Shchadov was scheduled to address the congress Thursday. He was
shouted down and driven from the hall when he spoke to a similar
miners' congress last summer.
   At the congress of the government-sponsored trade union
association in Moscow, Gorbachev urged delegates ``to keep in touch
with all sections of the working people.''
   He urged them to support his reforms, which he said were aimed
at creating ``a society of democratic institutions and mechanisms
that preserve and maintain law and order. But we are still far from
it.''
   It was not clear whether the miners' new union would be allowed
or would want to join the newly reformed national trade union
organization, whose leaders acknowledged they were losing the
support of workers.
   Deputy chief Vladimir Scherbakov said the revamped organization
would no longer demand a monopoly on workers' loyalty.
   The bidding for workers' hearts, in a country that once called
itself a workers' paradise, shows the political importance that
organizers place on blue-collar labor as the political and economic
system opens up.
   The miners' strikes of 1989 began in protest of working and
living conditions and shortages of such basics as soap and medical
care.
   Demands quickly escalated to include regional economic autonomy
for the main mining regions, the Kuznetsk Basin, the Don River
Basin in the Ukraine, Vorkuta in the far north and Karaganda in
Kazakhstan.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov persuaded the miners to return
to work, promising to meet most of their demands. But most of those
promises remain unfulfilled.
   The strike committees, meeting at their first conference in
Donetsk last summer, called for Ryzhkov's government to resign.

   The second of four secret policemen
convicted of the 1984 slaying of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a
pro-Solidarity priest, has been released from prison, the
prosecutor general said Wednesday.
   Lt. Leszek Pekala originally was sentenced to 15 years in prison
after a three-month trial that ended in February 1985. But his term
was reduced in 1987 to six years, and he was freed Tuesday under a
law that allows releases after a prisoner has served two-thirds of
his sentence.
   The release was confirmed at a news conference by Prosecutor
General Aleksander Herzog.
   Popieluszko, a charismatic 37-year-old Warsaw priest whose
sermons bolstered the Solidarity labor movement when it was
outlawed, was abducted Oct. 19, 1984. His beaten and bound body was
pulled from an icy river 11 days later, shocking the nation and
galvanizing the anti-Communist opposition.
   Pekala and Wlademar Chmielewski were found guilty of committing
the murder with ringleader Grzegorz Piotrowski. Their superior,
Adam Pietruszka, also was convicted.
   The public was never satisfied with the determination that no
higher-ups were involved in the murder or its coverup. On Oct. 6,
the post-Communist Interior Ministry reopened the case by arresting
two former police generals on charges of masterminding the slaying.
   The four convicted officers all had their sentences reduced by
the former Communist authorities, and Chmielewski has already been
paroled. Piotrowski now is serving a 15-year term due to end in
October 1999, and Pietruszka's 10-year sentence is to end in
November 1994, Herzog said.
   The prosecutor said the government is reviewing the Supreme
Court decisions reducing the sentences and ``some irregularities''
are being analyzed. However, an extraordinary reopening of the case
would be required to reverse the sentence reductions, and ``the
problem ... is very difficult,'' Herzog said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Wednesday urged President
Bush not to sign proposed legislation broadening use of the death
penalty.
   In a letter to the president, the international human rights
group said that if the proposal becomes law, ``social justice may
be simply ignored in the desire to seek vengeance.''
   The letter said Amnesty was aware of ``at least 23 innocent
people'' executed in the United States this century.
   ``Amnesty International is opposed to the death penalty in all
cases, based on our conviction that no authority has the right to
deny anyone their most basic and fundamental human right - the
right to life itself,'' the letter said.
   David Bull, British section director of Amnesty, delivered the
letter to the U.S. Embassy in London on Wednesday.
   The congressional proposals would extend the death penalty to
some nonhomicidal offenses under federal law.
   Amnesty said such a move ``represents a dangerous departure from
the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1972, which stated that the death
penalty would be `cruel and unusual' when applied to offenses which
did not result in death.''
   A total of 138 people have been executed in the United States
since the court in 1976 allowed states to resume use of the death
penalty. Fifteen states have done so.
   In its plea to Bush, Amnesty referred to ``the self-evident
racial bias in death penalty sentencing and the carrying out of
such sentences.''
   The Bush administration strongly supports the death penalty, but
it has threatened a veto over attempts by some congressmen to allow
defendants to fight the death sentence by showing racial bias.
   Many opponents of the death penalty argue it is unfair because
it is more often applied to blacks than whites.
   Amnesty also said studies have shown the death penalty is not an
effective deterrent to violent crime or murder.
   It further argued that execution methods are ``cruel and
barbaric.''

<DATELINE>BANJUL, Gambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cease-fire accord signed by two of
Liberia's three warring parties was rejected Wednesday by the
largest faction in the 10-month-old civil war.
   A spokesman for rebel leader Charles Taylor said the
disagreement centered on the composition of a multinational task
force dispatched in August to end the fighting, which has claimed
more than 5,000 lives and destroyed many sections of Liberia's
capital Monrovia.
   Taylor spokesman Tom Woewiyu said the rebel commander wants the
task force expanded to include soldiers of governments sympathetic
to his movement, including Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. The
five-nation force includes troops from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea,
Sierra Leone and Gambia.
   The talks in Banjul were the first time in months the three
factions met together.
   Taylor is opposed by remnants of slain President Samuel Doe's
forces, who still hold the executive mansion in Monrovia, and a
splinter rebel group led by Prince Johnson.
   Both groups have cooperated with the multinational force and
approved the cease-fire agreement.
   Taylor invaded from Ivory Coast on Christmas Eve seeking to oust
Doe, who was captured and killed Sept. 9 by Johnson's troops.
   Wednesday's cease-fire agreement was negotiated after three days
of talks mediated by the Economic Community of West African States,
which sent the task force to Liberia.
   The last attempt to end the conflict broke down in late
September when the task force attacked Taylor's men for refusing to
relinquish control of the Liberian capital.
   Using fighter bombers and tanks, the regional force has pushed
Taylor's army out of the city.
   But Taylor's rebels have overrun most of the rest of the nation
and Taylor has set up headquarters in the central city of Gbarnga,
declared himself president and announced plans to hold elections.
   Also opposed to Taylor is an interim government chosen by exiled
Liberian politicians, clergymen and businessmen at a conference
organized by the West African organization.
   Taylor has said he is entitled to run a temporary government as
the spoils of war, and has denounced the interim government as a
puppet of West African governments that sent soldiers to Liberia.

   The Senate on Wednesday approved a bill
designed to let consumers know what's in the food they eat.
   The legislation would require food manufacturers to list on
labels the amount of nutrients, calories, fat and salt for most
packaged foods. Claims such as ``low salt'' and ``light'' would be
clearly defined and disease-prevention claims would have to be
government-approved.
   The bill, passed by unanimous consent, will go back to the
House, which passed a similar version in late July and was expected
to accept the Senate's changes.
   ``Labeling will guarantee that advertising claims are supported
by the facts, and that consumers have the information they need to
make wiser choices about their health and diet,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass. and chairman of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   The Bush administration has proposed food-labeling regulations
similar to the provisions of the legislation. Because the
administration says the matter can be handled with regulations, it
has said in a policy statement that it opposes the bill. However,
the administration has not threatened a veto.
   The Food and Drug Administration had hoped to issue final
food-labeling regulations by next spring, requiring industry
compliance a year later. But because of differences between the
legislation and the regulations have forced the FDA to rework parts
of its plan.
   ``It will delay what we had been doing, but we won't have to go
back to square one,'' said Edward Scarbrough, acting director of
the FDA's Office of Nutrition and Food Science.
   One difference between the proposed regulations and the
legislation is that Congress would require much of the nutrient
labeling to be uniform nationwide. The FDA had requested comment on
whether states should be allowed to supersede the federal
regulations with stronger rules.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest gave the Senate
plan ``a qualified hurrah.'' Bruce Silverglade, legal director of
the group, said ``the days of misleading nutrition and health
claims for most foods are coming to an end.'' But he said he was
concerned that cities and states would be unable to impose their
own labeling requirements.
   The National Food Processors Association, however, was pleased
with the uniformity requirement. ``We did not get all we wanted in
terms of federal preemption, but we have a strong federal nutrition
labeling law that will help maintain our national food distribution
system and permit nationwide food label education programs,'' he
said.
   Under the Senate measure, the secretary of health and human
services would set guidelines defining such labels as ``low salt''
and ``light.'' Food makers would have to adhere to the guidelines
to use those terms.
   Also, companies would need FDA approval to make
disease-prevention claims.
   Restaurants would be exempt from the labeling requirements, and
foods such as fresh produce and seafood could provide nutrition
labeling with a sign or brochure at the site of sale.

   About 3,000 Romanians demonstrated
Wednesday for reunification with Moldavia, the largely ethnic
Romanian area that was annexed by the Soviets during World War II.
   The demonstrators, who included some opposition party leaders,
marched along the capital's main boulevard shouting nationalistic
slogans.
   They massed in front of the Soviet embassy on the outskirts of
the city, where they handed embassy officials a written protest
declaiming the alleged infringement of Romanian rights in Soviet
Moldavia.
   The region, known by Romanians as Bessarabia, was ceded to the
Soviet Union in 1940, but still has a Romanian-speaking majority of
more than 2 million. Romanian was restored as its official language
last year, and cultural ties between Bessarabians and Romanians
have been strengthened.
   The Romanian government, however, has been reluctant to openly
side with those demanding the area back for fear of bringing about
other claims on present Romanian territory.
   ``It's an obvious fact that Bessarabia is Romanian,'' declared
Ion Puiu, president of the Free Christian Democrat Party.
   ``We are here to fight what's left of Soviet imperialism, which
is attempting to deprive us of our sacred land,'' said Free
Republican Party leader Nica Leon.
   Other groups represented at the rally were the Free Democrat
Party, the Independent Peasant Party, the Pro-Bessarabia Cultural
Association and the Student League.
   The demonstrators shouted ``Moscow, don't forget, Bessarabia
does not belong to you!'' and ``Bessarabia is Romanian land!''
   Several dozen policemen were present during the three-hour
demonstration. There were no incidents.

   Children with dreadlocks will not be
allowed to attend public schools, the education minister of Antigua
and Barbuda announced.
   Education Minister Reuben Harris made public his position
Tuesday to members of the Rastafarian community while discussing
the question of their children attending local schools.
   The Rastafarians are a religious group who foster black
consciousness and their African background and wear their hair in
small plaits known as dreadlocks. Many smoke marijuana as part of
their religious practice.
   ``I know some people think I'm colonial, but I must tell all
that I will support the colonial way of life if it promotes
discipline and cleanliness,' Harris said.
   A spokesman for the Rasta said the minister's
position is discriminatory and that they would seek a meeting with
the Cafarian communitybinet of Prime Minister Vere Bird to discuss the
issue.
   ``We feel that this day and age this action by the minister is a
violation of one's rights under the constitution,'' spokesman Ras
Franki said.
   About 77,000 people reside in the two east Caribbean islands,
which are 250 miles southeast of Puerto Rico.

   The government of Panama filed a $6.5 billion
racketeering lawsuit Wednesday against its former military ruler,
charging Manuel Noriega looted the nation's treasury and tortured
and killed his opponents.
   ``We have long waited for justice, and justice is beginning to
happen here,'' said Eduardo Vallarino, Panama's ambassador to the
United States, who accompanied the lawyer filing the suit. ``We
have a duty to the people of all the world to show that
dictatorship and tyranny doesn't ultimately pay.''
   The Panamanian government's lawsuit contains 11 charges against
the toppled dictator for alleged misconduct during his 28-year
military and political career.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District court, says Noriega
participated in assassination, torture, drug trafficking, money
laundering, embezzlement, sale of visas and passports and other
abuses while he was head of the Panama Defense Forces.
   A process server sent by Panama's attorney Gregory Craig failed
Wednesday in an attempt to serve papers on Noriega at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center southwest of Miami, where he has
been held on drug-trafficking charges since the December 1989
invasion of Panama.
   Prison spokeswoman Dena Davion said the process server was
turned away for security reasons, and that a judge would have to
order the U.S. Marshals Service to deliver official notice of the
suit to Noriega.
   The final years of Noriega's reign deflated Panama's gross
national product by 20 percent through corruption and misrule,
Vallarino charged. Panama estimated those damages at $500 million,
which can be tripled under U.S. racketeering law. The Panamanian
government also is seeking $5 billion in punitive damages.
   But Vallarino, who was appointed ambassador by the government of
President Guillermo Endara, said the damage to Panama went beyond
economics.
   ``We are also talking about murders,'' the ambassador said,
mentioning the bloody torture slaying of opposition leader Hugo
Spadafora. ``Many other persons were blatantly and openly murdered
in the streets of Panama.''
   The United States holds $20 million frozen in international bank
accounts, some of which has been earmarked for Noriega's criminal
defense attorneys, but Craig said Panama was asking for an
injunction to stop any release of Noriega's money.
   The Panamanian government estimated Noriega earned a total of
$700,000 in the military, but Craig said Noriega still he has $300
million to $500 million in assets that have not been attached by
the U.S. government.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said the lawsuit was an attempt to
interfere with his client's consitutional right to a fair trial,
including the right to choose and pay his own attorneys.
   ``This isn't about money,'' May said of the lawsuit. ``This is
simply an attempt to keep General Noriega from having sufficient
assets to be able to defend himself.''
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen acknowledged a conflict existed
over the money involved in the criminal case assigned to U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler and the civil case assigned to U.S.
District Judge Edward Davis, but not an insurmountable one.
   ``As we have said in court to Judge Hoeveler several times, the
United States government is not the only government that has made
claims on that money,'' he said. ``When we release our claim ... to
pay defense counsel here, we do not of course control foreign
governments.''
   Lehtinen said he did not believe the lawsuit would interfere
with Noriega's criminal prosecution on drug-trafficking charges.
   The criminal charges accuse Noriega of turning Panama into a way
station for Columbia's Medellin cocaine cartel and accepting $4.6
million in bribes to protect their smuggling.
   Hoeveler has said he would not allow Panama's long-expected
lawsuit to sidetrack Noriega's prosecution.
   Craig said he could not identify Noriega's 20 co-defendants in
the civil case because they have not been served.
   But previous reports listed other targets as Marcos Justines,
noriega's chief of staff jailed in Panama City; Carlos Duque, the
1989 presidential candidate of Noriega's Revolutionary Democratic
Party; Michael Harari, a former Israeli military officer; three
former ambassadors; Noriega's wife, Felicidad; his mistress Vicki
Amado and others.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Passes Law to Reassert Control over Republics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet parliament sought to arrest the
collapse of central authority by passing legislation Wednesday
saying its laws supercede those of conflicting measures in the 15
Soviet republics.
   Three republics immediately challenged the parliamentary move.
   The sponsors of the national bill said it is designed to end the
``war of laws'' between the national and republic governments, but
there seemed to be little way to enforce it and no promise it would
end the jurisdictional disputes.
   In defending the measure, Soviet lawmaker Yuri Kalmykov was
quoted as saying, ``We are neither declaring war on the republics
nor bringing pressure to bear on them.
   ``The republics should understand that this legal act is in the
interests of all,'' he said, according to the state news agency
Tass. Kalmykov is chairman of the parliamentary committee on
legislation in the national Supreme Soviet, the parliament.
   Despite his comments, the two largest Soviet republics, Russia
and the Ukraine, on Wednesday passed their own laws overruling
national legislation, Tass said in separate dispatches.
   In addition, the parliament of the Baltic republic of Latvia,
which declared independence this year, passed a law saying
state-owned property belongs to the republic and not to the
national government, Tass said.
   The Latvian law overturned an Oct. 19 decree by Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. He ordered that 51 percent of
state-owned industries and businesses be sold to workers on a
joint-stock basis and the remaining 49 percent stay in the hands of
the national government.
   In its action Wednesday, the Russian Republic legislature,
meeting in Moscow, gave preliminary approval to laws limiting the
authority of the national government in the republic and abolishing
the state monopoly on land ownership, Tass said.
   The Ukrainian legislature, meeting in Kiev, proclaimed the
precedence of the republic's laws over national laws on Ukrainian
territory. National laws will enter into force in the Ukraine only
after they are ratified by the republic's parliament, it said.
   The fragmentation of Soviet power was also deepening in the
republic of Moldavia, where an emergency session of parliament was
called for Thursday, Tass reported.
   Moldavian President Mircha Snegur said the session was needed
because the ``social and economic situation in the republic has
reached the boiling point'' due to declarations of independence by
two tiny corners of Moldavia, a southwestern republic. The
so-called Gagauz and Dneister republics are seeking to separate
themselves from Moldavia.
   Nearly all the 15 Soviet republics have declared independence or
autonomy from the central government. In Moldavia, Georgia and the
Russian Federation, smaller regions have sought to distance
themselves from republic authorities.
   The law passed Wednesday by the national legislature appeared to
be a fruitless effort suspend the constitutional crisis until
completion of a new treaty of union that Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev is seeking to persuade the republics to negotiate.
   Gorbachev has had little success starting formal talks to
replace the treaty of union, which forms the legal basis of the
national federation.
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and other radical reformers
want to negotiate bilateral treaties on political and economic
cooperation before agreeing to a new treaty of union to form a
federation or confederation.
   National legislators heatedly debated Wednesday's law. Their
dispute centered on a clause giving Gorbachev the right to fire
local officials who disregard national law, Tass said.
   One house of the national legislature, the Council of
Nationalities, approved the law without the clause. The other
house, the Council of the Union, approved it with the clause.
   They later agreed on a compromise that apparently left the issue
undecided.

   Palestinians stayed home from jobs in Israel
Wednesday as troops sealed off the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip in an effort to stem a wave of Arab-Israeli revenge attacks.
   The latest victim, a Palestinian accused of stabbing two unarmed
Israeli women soldiers, died Wednesday of head injuries reportedly
suffered when he was kicked and beaten by Israelis after the
attack.
   In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the death of an 18-year-old Palestinian
set off a general strike in the city's Arab sector.
   On Tuesday, Defense Minister Moshe Arens ordered the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip banned from entering
Israel, where many of them work.
   The ban, which began Wednesday, was in response to a string of
attacks on Jews that left three people dead and eight wounded since
Sunday.
   A 30-year-old Palestinian laborer was also killed, and three of
his cousins were wounded by gunshots fired from an Israeli civilian
car. Other Arab workers driving in Israel have had their cars
stoned during the violence.
   Police Minister Roni Milo said the closure of the territories,
expected to last several days, was meant to teach Arabs a lesson.
   ``The state of Israel must make it completely clear that we will
not permit ... the attacking of Jews and stabbing of women soldiers
or civilians. We will not allow this to happen without response,''
he said on army radio.
   In the Israeli Parliament, legislators called for making the
closure permanent. Surprisingly, some of the strongest arguments
came from left-wing politicians who normally argue for making peace
with the Arabs.
   ``If there's any chance of reaching political dialogue it's by
disengagement of the two peoples,'' Chaim Ramon, a leftist member
of the Labor Party, told Israel television.
   Israeli fear over the attacks was evident Wednesday. There was a
reported run on gun shops, and thousands of Israelis called police
to report Arabs still present in Israel.
   Sarah Benjamin, head of police operations in Tel Aviv, estimated
that she and her colleagues got 1,700 such calls from the coastal
city and its suburbs.
   The Palestinian accused of stabbing the two women soldiers on
Tuesday, Omar Shawaneh, 39, died at Rambam Hospital in Haifa,
hospital officials said.
   One of his victims was reported in serious but stable condition
with a chest wound on Wednesday. The other suffered a superficial
knife wound in the back.
   Israeli television and radio both carried accounts of Israeli
citizens who said they helped capture the suspect, describing how
he was punched, kicked and beaten.
   There was initial confusion over how Shawaneh was injured
because a police statement said he was questioned before being
hospitalized and the radio said he told police he came to Israel to
carry out an attack.
   But Shawaneh, from a West Bank village near Jenin, was later
reported unconscious and in critical condition in Rambam's
neurosurgery ward.
   Northern district police spokesman Danny Ramati, reached by
telephone, said Shawaneh's death was under investigation.
   Ramati confirmed that Shawaneh was taken to a police station
before being hospitalized, but said the blows Shawaneh suffered
were from soldiers and civilians ``during the struggle in the field
. . . while he was putting up stiff resistance to arrest.''
   Also Wednesday in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini, a leading pro-PLO
figure, was released on $2,500 bail. He was arrested on suspicion
of inciting the riot that led to the Oct. 8 Temple Mount police
shootings, in which at least 19 Palestinians were killed.
   Husseini denied any incitement, saying he was trying to calm
things down.
   Meanwhile, Salim Awad Khaldi died of a bullet wound to the
chest, becoming another victim of the violence on Oct. 8.
   Initial reports said he was shot in the Temple Mount clash, but
Arab reporters and police sources later said he was wounded by
gunfire from an Israeli civilian on a nearby street.
   News of his death sparked a general strike in Arab east
Jerusalem.
   The deaths Wednesday brought to 766 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli troops and civilians in the 34-month Palestinian
uprising. Fifty-one Israelis also have been slain in the violence.
   In the West Bank, the body of a 50-year-old Palestinian was
found stabbed to death near Tulkarem, and Arab reports said he was
suspected of collaborating with Israel. During the uprising, 287
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most as allegedly
collaborators.

   Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh
charged Wednesday that the CIA and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
abused secrecy procedures to frustrate the prosecution of a former
CIA agent.
   ``The attorney general and the CIA not only frustrated the
public development'' of evidence against former CIA agent Joseph
Fernandez, ``but did so in a manner that exasperated the district
court and dragged out the resolution of this issue in unproductive
litigation,'' Walsh said in a rpeort on the case.
   Walsh issued his report nearly two weeks after Thornburgh
formally ended the prosecution by stating he would not withdraw his
affidavit blocking the release of secrets the judge ruled Fernandez
was entitled to disclose in the case.
   On Oct. 12, the attorney general stuck by a previous decision
blocking the release of documents showing the location o CIA
facilities in Central America and detailing agency operations in
Costa Rica. The Justice Department quoted an administration
official as saying release of such information would strike a
``devastating'' blow to national security.
   The judge in the case had ruled that Fernandez, former CIA
station chief in Costa Rica, was entitled to disclose the
information to defend himself against charges he lied about his
role in helping ship arms to the Nicaraugan rebels.
   Thornburgh's action marked the first time that an attorney
general had invoked a provision of the Classified Information
Procedures Act to block a prosecution.
   It capped a 15-month legal battle during which, Walsh charged,
Thornburgh forced two ``fruitless appeals'' to the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., on secrecy issues.
   The appellate court in September upheld U.S. District Judge
Claude Hilton's dismissal of the charges because Thornburgh had
refused to allow Fernandez to use evidence needed to defend
himself.
   ``If the information could not be revealed without grave damage,
why did he force two appeals rather than reach this conclusion 15
months ago? If the potential danger is, as he reports,
`devastating', why did he promise to reconsider his decision if the
dismissal of the case was affirmed on appeal?'' Walsh wrote.
   The Bush administration's actions in the Iran-Contra cases
``underscore the need for objective standards to govern the release
of classified information in criminal prosecutions,'' Walsh said.
   ``This is particularly true when there is an appearance of
conflict of interest because the agency refusing disclosure is
itself a subject of investigation,'' Walsh said in a reference to
his continuing probe of CIA involvement in the Iran-Contra affair
and the subsequent coverup.
   Walsh called ``disingenuous'' Thornburgh's assertion the
independent counsel's strategy in dealing with the classified
information problems forced him to block the release of all
secrets.
   A Justice Department letter to Congress, released Wednesday,
said that Walsh's acquiesence to a court review of categories of
documents rather than an item-by-item examination of the material
complicated Thornburgh's decision.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for Walsh, said that when Thornburgh
filed his affidavit last November blocking the release of secrets,
he did not object to the category-by-category procedure.
   Belcher said Walsh's office ``did not acquiesce in the
category-by-category rulings'' suggested by Hilton. ``We
strenuously argued for specific review of documents after the
categories were ruled on,'' she said.
   The Justice Department letter also noted that ``those who are
familiar with the case asset it as a relatively weak one which
would not have been brought had Fernandez been willing to cooperate
with the investigation.''
   ``We obviously disagree that it was a weak case,'' said Mary
Belcher, a spokeswoman for Walsh.

   The budget bills in Congress are designed to
reign in deficit spending which, if unchecked, would add more than
$1 trillion to the national debt in the next five years.
   That would continue the pattern of the 1980s, during which the
Treasury was forced to triple its borrowing. The national debt is
now $3.195 trillion.
   The White House estimates the deficit for the current fiscal
year, which began Oct. 1, will be $294 billion dollars. The budget
legislation before Congress would trim that by roughly $40 billion,
so only another $254 billion will get added to the long-term debt.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force general named to replace the
chief of staff fired for public comments about U.S. contingency
plans against Iraq said Wednesday his friend made an ``honest
mistake.''
   Gen. Merrill A. McPeak told the Senate Armed Services Committee
his colleague erred in discussing issues within the president's
bailiwick and speaking on the record with news reporters for 15
hours straight.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney fired Gen. Michael Dugan on Sept.
17, one day after Dugan's statements about contingency plans to
unleash massive air raids on Iraq and target Saddam Hussein
personally appeared in several newspapers.
   Cheney said Dugan had violated Pentagon rules by publicly
discussing likely military targets inside Iraq and disclosing
classified information about the size of U.S. forces in the gulf
area.
   ``It was an honest mistake on his part, nevertheless a mistake.
I'll certainly seek to avoid making the same mistake,'' McPeak told
the panel at his confirmation hearing.
   Lawmakers indicated no opposition to the nominee, a 54-year-old
native of Santa Rosa, Calif., who is commander-in-chief of forces
in the Pacific region.
   While serving as a fighter pilot in 1961, McPeak said he struck
up a friendship with Dugan, a fellow lieutenant. ``Mike Dugan is
probably my closest friend in the U.S. Air Force,'' McPeak said.
   The nominee backed a number of steps Dugan took during his brief
term, in particular his attempts to improve frosty relations
between the Air Force and Congress and the media.
   ``I think he was right about an awful lot of things he started
to do during his tenure as chief, in particular his initiative
toward greater openness,'' McPeak said. ``I endorse that.''
   The Air Force general said Dugan made a mistake in ``expressing
an opinion about military options that are really a decision for
the president to make.''
   Dugan remains at the Pentagon as a special assistant to Air
Force Secretary Donald Rice. He is currently overseeing studies on
the future needs for pilots and navigators as well as the officer
evaluation system.

   Jews and Roman Catholics met to pay homage
to a nearly disappeared culture Wednesday, capping the event by
attending a stirring concert in a synagogue scarred by neglect and
Nazi defacement.
   ``Being here and listening to the music of our people is a way
to tell the world that we go on living,'' said Irene Weingarten, a
certified public accountant from Houston, one of about 250 American
Jews who flew to Krakow, a southern Polish city rich in Jewish
history, to attend the event.
   Gilbert Levine, maestro of the Krakow Philharmonic Orchestra,
conducted the concert inside the Temple Postepowa, a 100-year-old
synagogue virtually unused since World War II.
   Poland's Jewish community, which once numbered 3.5 million, was
nearly wiped out by the Holocaust. Despite the fact that fewer than
10,000 Jews remain, anti-Semitism has resurfaced in recent months.
   Pope John Paul II, archbishop of Krakow before being named
pontiff in 1978, heartily endorsed the concert as a vehicle for
reconciliation between the faiths, said Levine, who was received by
the pope at the Vatican.
   The chief of Krakow's tiny Jewish congregation, Czeslaw
Jakobowicz, said he found the concert ``sad but very nice.''
   ``You know, we all lived together, Catholics and Jews, in this
society for hundreds of years,'' Jakobowicz said. ``There is no
reason it can't be like it used to be.''
   Levine said several high-ranking church officials had been
invited to the conciliatory event for two faiths, including Krakow
Archbishop Franciszek Marcharski. But local priests were the
highest church representatives in attendance.
   A letter from Macharski read before the concert quoted John
Paul's words: ``We are all children of the same God.'' It closed
with ``Shalom,'' the Hebrew word for peace.
   The program opened with the national anthems of Poland, the
United States and Israel, followed by the Kol Nidre, a traditional
lament of Jews sung during the Yom Kippur holiday.
   The program also included works of Beethoven, Bruch and Dvorak.
   The dark apricot walls and gold filigree arches and columns of
Temple Postempowa reflected five decades of neglect, but the
concert's audience of 400 people sharing the small space with the
orchestra was moved by the music. Many wiped away tears.
   Before the concert, members of both faiths joined to raise a
Star of David atop the synagogue, replacing one torn down by the
Gestapo in November 1939.
   ``This will be a concert of rememberance, because you can't
forget what happened in Poland 50 years ago, and of hope for
reconciliation,'' said Levine, who has headed the philharmonic
since 1987, the first American to direct an orchestra in eastern
Europe.
   Only a handful of Jews live in Krakow today; their average age
is 70. The synagogue stands in a neighborhood that has had a Jewish
presence since the 1300s.
   In recent years, Catholic-Jewish relations in Poland have been
strained by the presence of Carmelite nuns at the Auschwitz
concentration camp, 36 miles from Krakow.
   Over Jewish protests, the nuns built a convent adjoining the
camp where 1.5 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis. The church
first promised to remove the convent in 1987, and renewed the
promise last year, but so far it has not done so.
   This year also has witnessed anti-Semitic acts in newly
democratized Poland, as well as elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Nazi
slogans and anti-Jewish slurs have appeared on bus stops and even
the memorial at Umschlagplatz, the site in Warsaw where hundreds of
thousands of Jews were sent to concentration camps.
   Levine, whose grandfather emigrated from Warsaw in 1895 and
whose wife's mother survived Auschwitz, said the concert presented
an opportunity to overcome some of the bitterness that has
overshadowed recent dialogue between Catholics and Jews in Poland.
   ``Music can serve a tremendously important purpose to wordlessly
express emotions,'' Levine said. ``But you have to have hope and a
desire for reconciliation and for dialogue. That at least goes some
of the way toward achieving it.''

<HEAD>Senate Approves Foreign Aid Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved a $15.5
billion foreign aid bill that includes a cut in El Salvador's
military aid and debt forgiveness for Egypt, after an abortion
controversy over the bill evaporated.
   The Senate voted 76-23 for the bill, sending it to negotiations
to work out differences with a House-passed version.
   Since last week, the measure had been stalled because of a
dispute over whether to reverse a 6-year-old policy that bars U.S.
aid to international population control agencies that offer
abortion as an option.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., ended his push for the change in the
face of a filibuster threat by anti-abortion forces, including Sen.
William Armstrong, R-Colo. Wirth did not want to jeopardize the
entire foreign aid bill in the waning days of the 101st Congress,
an aide said.
   The bill provides aid to U.S. friends and allies around the
world, including $3 billion for Israel and $2.1 billion for Egypt,
the two biggest recipients.
   Both the House and the Senate versions of the bill include a 50
percent cut in military aid to El Salvador, intended to give
incentives to both the government and the leftist FMLN rebels to
end their decade-long civil war with a negotiated settlement.
   The bills provide that military aid would be cut to half its
current level of $85 million in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   If the rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
walk away from U.N.-sponsored peace talks, the aid could be
restored. But if the government fails to pursue peace, it could
lose the other half of its military aid.
   The language represents a major change in U.S. policy toward El
Salvador, which has received aid at a rate of nearly $1 million a
day in recent years. Bush's top advisers have threatened to veto
any bill that contained such an aid cut.
   But the bill also contains a powerful incentive for the
president to sign: forgiveness of $6.7 billion in past military
loans Egypt owes the United States. Bush has sought to erase the
debt as a reward to Egypt, which has been among the staunchest U.S.
allies in opposing Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   Administration officials have argued that a substantial reward
is due President Hosni Mubarak, who took a serious political risk
by leading Arab opposition to Iraq. Mubarak's continued tenure
could well depend on a tangible American gesture, they contended.
   In addition to the cash aid for Israel, the Senate version of
the bill also included authority for the president to give Israel
at least $700 million worth of Pentagon weaponry.
   That provision was pushed by supporters of Israel who argued it
was needed because of the increased threat to that country from
Iraq and the increased costs of Israel's high military alert. It
also appeared designed to counterbalance the likely debt
forgiveness for Egypt and a $7.5 billion arms sale approved for
Saudi Arabia.
   In other action on spending bills, the Senate and House approved
and sent to President Bush a $19.3 billion bill providing fiscal
1991 money for the departments of Commerce, Justice and State, and
for the Judiciary branch.
   The measure includes full payment of U.S. dues to the United
Nations, as well as 20 percent of dues that had been withheld in
prior years because of U.S. dissatisfaction with the world body. It
also includes $105 million for prosecution of savings and loan
scandal cases and $694 million for the Drug Enforcement Agency.

<TEXT>
   Huge posters of a fallen dictator
draped in black festooned the campaign headquarters of
parliamentary candidate Ijaz ul-Haq, who fought and won Wednesday's
elections on the memory of his father.
   Hours after polls closed, Ijaz was being declared the unofficial
winner over favored candidate Shahed Zafar, production minister
under ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   Boisterous celebrations began early at Ijaz's headquarters in
the heart of the Rawalpindi. Horns blared and music roared from
loudspeakers atop beat up Suzukis, antiquated British-made Morris
cars and horse-drawn carts.
   ``It's only for Zia ul-Haq,'' said campaign worker Amjad Hussain
of the right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance, known by its
Urdu-language initials IJI.
   Zia overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father, the late Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a bloodless coup in 1977. Two years later,
Bhutto was hanged on controversial charges of conspiring to kill a
political foe.
   Zia ruled Pakistan until his death in an August 1988 plane
crash. Thirty others also died, including senior generals and U.S.
Ambassador Arnold Raphael.
   The cause of the C-130 crash in a desert in Punjab Province
remains a mystery. Ijaz blames a militant group of Ms. Bhutto's
populist Pakistan People's Party, Al Zulfikar, named for her
father.
   Zia's death paved the way for Pakistan's first free elections in
more than a decade. Zia twice promised elections, but later
reneged.
   Ms. Bhutto, capitalizing on her father's memory, won the largest
bloc of votes in 1988 but failed to win a majority.
   Ijaz and Ms. Bhutto are at opposite ends of the political
spectrum - she to the left and he to the far right - but there are
similarities.
   Both studied in Europe and the United States. Ijaz received his
masters of business administration from the University of Illinois.
Ms. Bhutto studied at Oxford and Harvard.
   Both claim their father was a martyr - hers for democracy, his
for Islam.
   Like Ms. Bhutto, Ijaz waged his election campaign on the memory
of his dead father. His slogans mirrored hers.
   Ms. Bhutto reminded followers that the founder of the People's
Party worked for the downtrodden and poor. Ijaz recalled his
father's middle-class roots and his concern for the poor.
   ``The vote is not for IJI. It's not a vote even for Ijaz, it's
really a vote for Zia,'' said Hussein. ``People have respect for
Zia.''

<HEAD>Leftist Rebels Kill a Top Army Figure in Peru</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels on Wednesday shot to death an
army officer on the joint military command near his house in this
capital, defense sources said.
   In Ayacucho, the Andean city where Maoist Shining Path rebels
launched their movement, the government lifted a state of
emergency. It was imposed in December 1982.
   The military sources said Lt. Col. Oscar Caballero Castillo was
gunned down as he was getting into his car near his house in a
middle-class Lima neighborhood.
   The sources said they were unsure which of Peru's two guerrilla
groups killed Caballero. At least three rebels, including a woman,
took part in the attack, they said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The assassination, however, was typical of the Shining Path. The
much smaller Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement has not committed
many assassinations.
   Caballero was shot in the head, neck and leg. He died in a
military hospital hours after the attack.
   Before being assigned to the joint military command in Lima, the
42-year-old officer served in Ayacucho.
   Though the state of emergency was lifted there, the measure was
extended in rural areas surrounding the city, as well as in nine
other departments. More than half of Peru's population of 22
million people live under a military state of emergency.
   Under the measure, authorities can restrict the freedom to
travel and assemble. They can also detain people without hearings
and search houses without warrant.
   Violence has decreased drastically in Ayacucho the last three
years as the Shining Path spread its operations into other parts of
the country. The rebels are now thought to base many of their
Andean operations in Huancayo, 120 miles east of Lima.
   Another rebel stronghold is the Upper Huallaga Valley. Rebels
there receive guns and money in exchange for allowing drug
traffickers to operate in the coca-rich area.
   More than 20,000 Peruvians have died in political violence in
the 10 years since the Shining Path first took up arms.

<BYLINE>Council Hears Arguments On New References for God
^By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee revising prayers and rituals for the
United Methodist Church disagrees about whether to refer to God as
anything but a masculine deity, a bishop told the church's high
court on Wednesday.
   Bishop Susan Morrison of Philadelphia asked the church's
Judicial Council to rule on petitions from the committee revising
the ``Book of Worship.'' Ms. Morrison heads the committee.
   A minority of committee members disagree with proposals to
replace the existing reference to the Trinity as ``Father, Son and
Holy Spirit'' with such non-gender specific references as
``Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer,'' Ms. Morrison said.
   ``We're honoring the Trinity language,'' said Ms. Morrison, who
sides with the majority. ``But in other places, sometimes we use
``Father'' and other times we use other Biblical metaphors such as
creator.
   ``We don't want to use any one image of God. Sometimes we use
female images, such as the mother who nurtures her young,'' she
said.
   The church, which has nearly 9 million members, is revising its
official ``Book of Worship'' for the first time in 20 years.
   Each congregation would be allowed to decide whether to use
traditional references to God, or to adopt the references included
in the revised ``Book of Worship,'' Ms. Morrison said.
   The Judicial Council - made up of five lawyers and four
ministers - asked few questions about the debate during the
hearing. The council was expected to meet again within several
days.
   Council members indicated that at that time, they could delay a
final decision until next year, when the church's General Assembly
is expected to rule on the matter.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators faced several key
tax issues Wednesday night as they worked on a compromise
deficit-reduction bill.
   Here are some of them, according to a proposed compromise
incorporating elements from both parties.
   Exact figures could change in the course of further
negotiations.
   RATES: The 28 percent top income tax rate on the wealthiest
600,000 Americans likely would be raised to 31 percent; they would
get a tax increase. Effective rates could even be higher, depending
on exemptions and deductions. About 4 million couples and
individuals who now pay a top rate of 33 percent would pay a
maximum 31 percent and get a tax cut.
   DEDUCTIONS: A couple or individual could write off only 97
percent of otherwise allowable itemized deductions on any portion
of adjusted gross income exceeding $100,000. Thus, a high-income
taxpayer would lose $300 in deductions for each $10,000 of income
above $100,000. This has the effect of raising the top marginal tax
rate on those people to 32 percent.
   EXEMPTIONS: Benefits from the $2,050 personal exemption allowed
each taxpayer and dependent would be reduced as taxable income
exceeds $100,000 for single people and $150,000 for childless
couples filing a joint return. The exemption would be fully lost
once income tops $225,000 for single individuals or $275,000 for a
couple filing jointly.
   Each exemption lost would raise the effective marginal tax rate
by one-half percentage point; the bigger the family, the higher
their marginal rate. Thus, a couple with two children would pay a
top rate of 34 percent on part of their income: the regular 31
percent rate plus 1 percentage point because of the limit on
deductions and 2 points by losing their exemptions.
   CAPITAL GAINS: The maximum tax rate on capital gains, which are
profits from the sale of assets such as investments, would be 28
percent, even though wages and other income would be taxed as high
as 31 percent. This would benefit those who pay a top 33 percent
rate on income, including capital gains, under present law.
   GASOLINE: The 9-cent-a-gallon tax would be increased by 5 or 6
cents.
   ALCOHOL: Negotiators already have settled on higher taxes on
alcoholic beverages, tobacco, airplane tickets, furs and jewlery
and expensive cars.

<HEAD>Expert Says Food Prices Will Climb with Temperature Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Global warming will create food shortages that
could eventually drive up prices by as much as 20 percent, a
leading climate expert said Wednesday.
   Climatologist Martin Parry, a member of the U.N.-sponsored
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, forecast that higher
temperatures and drier conditions will reduce food production
globally by an average of 5 to 10 percent.
   His report, ``Climate Change and World Agriculture,'' was put
out by Earthscan, a publisher of books on Third World issues,
poverty and the environment.
   ``The nearly 1 billion people who already suffer from
malnutrition and famines ... would face an even greater threat to
their survival from the combined effects of decreased agricultural
production ... and the effects of higher prices for imported
food,'' Parry told reporters at a news conference at the Royal
Geographic Society.
   Parry said farming production could fall as much as 30 percent
in the mid-latitude breadbasket regions of the world such as the
midwestern United States, Canadian prairies, northern European
lowlands, Soviet Ukraine and Argentine pampas.
   The regions most at risk, however, are those least able to cope,
such as North and West Africa, Central America, Southeast Asia and
eastern Brazil, Parry said.
   His report was released five days before delegates from 100
nations meet in Geneva at the second World Climate Conference to
discuss what to do about reducing carbon dioxide and other
``greenhouse'' gases.
   Such gases increase the atmosphere's ability to trap heat, like
a greenhouse.
   Hundreds of the world's top scientists working on the
U.N.-sponsored climate panel have concluded that if the world
continues emitting the gases at the current rate, global avrrage
temperatures could rise a couple degrees over the next four
decades.
   But the actual temperature increase might be even higher in some
regions, with the largest rises in higher latitudes, said Parry, a
professor at Birmingham University.
   In the wheat and maize regions of Europe and North America,
production could be cut by 20 percent with a 2 degree centigrade
rise in temperature.
   The result could be increased costs of food for consumers in
those regions, smaller cereal crops for export, and higher prices
in the world cereal market.

   A tree trimmer suffocated under a heavy palm
fronds that fell on him as he working 25 feet up in the tree,
authorities said Wednesday.
   Neighbors heard the man's screams for help, but he died by the
time rescuers were able to free him and get him to the ground about
80 minutes later, fire officials said.
   Reynaldo Medrano, 36, was working alone Tuesday afternoon on a
palm tree in a back yard, said fire Capt. Kevin Boyle. Medrano died
of suffocation, the Maricopa County Medical Examiner Office said
Wednesday.
   Firefighters used a ladder to reach Medrano, who initially was
conscious but struggling to breathe, Boyle said.
   A ring of cut fronds, possibily weighing hundreds of pounds, had
``slipped down like a hula skirt,'' said Boyle. The weight kept
Medrano pinned, even after firefighters had cut his safety chain,
he said.
   By then, the captain said, Medrano was falling in and out of
consciousness. By the time rescuers got him to the ground, he was
dead.
   Falling palm fronds suffocated two workers in separate accidents
in 1987, one in Phoenix and the other in suburban Scottsdale.
   Palm fronds grow to six feet or more in length and resemble a
huge fan blade.

   The Magellan spacecraft found that
600-mile-wide circular features on Venus are mile-high volcanic
bulges created as molten rock bubbles up from inside the planet, a
scientist said Wednesday.
   From a bird's-eye-view, the bulges look like nested sets of
concentric rings. Called coronas, the rings are ridges and valleys
that form huge circles. Numerous volcanoes and lava flows dot the
coronas.
   The coronas are formed by the same kind of upwelling of
underground plumes of molten rock that created the Hawaiian
Islands, said Ellen Stofan, a geologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They're definitely formed by some sort of thermal pulse from
the interior of the planet'' that lasts hundreds of millions of
years, she said.
   In 1983 and 1984, the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft
identified about 30 coronas that measure from 75 miles to more than
600 miles across. But the Venera orbiters couldn't determine if
they were upward bulges or depressions in the ground caused by the
impacts of gargantuan meteorites.
   Magellan is examining the planet with a more sophisticated
radar, which makes much more detailed pictures and also is able to
calculate surface topography. It found five more coronas and
determined they rise as much as one mile above the surrounding
terrain. Stofan said that shows they are hot spots rather than
impact craters.
   One corona that's 150 miles wide seems to be in the early stages
of bulging upward, suggesting that some of its small volcanic domes
and lava flows may be actively erupting, she said.
   Magellan won't be able to confirm the presence of active
volcanoes until the middle of next year, when it passes over the
same part of Venus a second time and can look for landscape changes
resulting from any ongoing eruptions.
   NASA engineers, meanwhile, said the sun will almost block
Earth's view of Magellan and Venus on Nov. 1 when Venus, the sun
and Earth will be oriented in almost a straight line.
   That will cause a nine-day halt - starting sometime between
Saturday and Monday - in Magellan's use of radar to peer through
Venus' clouds and map the planet, said Phil Allin, administrative
assistant to Magellan's project manager.
   The astronomical lineup, called ``superior conjunction,'' also
may make NASA completely lose contact with Magellan for up to three
days, although engineers disagree on whether that will happen,
Allin said.
   The sun won't completely block Earth's view of Venus and
Magellan during the planetary lineup, but activity from the sun
already has impaired some communications, he said.
   Engineers twice lost touch with Magellan in August due to a
yet-unidentified problem. If that happens again when the
Venus-sun-Earth alignment also makes communication difficult or
impossible, ``we worry about how quickly we would get things back
to normal,'' Allin said.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, and arrived at the second planet from the sun on Aug. 10.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected
President Bush's appeal to cooperate with a U.N. probe of the
slayings of 19 Palestinians and avoid a second anti-Israel vote by
the security council, Israel television reported Wednesday.
   Later Wednesday, the United States and other Security Council
members voted 15-0 to rebuke Israel for its refusal to support the
investigation of the Oct. 8 shootings. It was the second vote
against Israel the past 10 days by the United States, which in the
past normally exercised its veto and shielded Israel from U.N.
censure.
   Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner could not immediately be reached
for comment.
   The television, referring to a letter from Bush that was
delivered Tuesday to Shamir, said, ``Shamir sees no possibility of
changing his position.''
   Shamir's Cabinet voted last week to refuse to cooperate with a
U.N. probe into the killings.
   The Cabinet said cooperating with the U.N. mission would
compromise Israel's rule over the city including the Arab sectors
Israel annexed following the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``If we put a loophole in our claim to sovereignty in Jerusalem,
the Arabs will exploit it at every future opportunity,'' the
television said, quoting an unnamed government official. Israel
captured the Arab sectors of Jerusalem in 1967.
   The television, quoting unnamed sources in Washington, also said
Bush, in the letter, ``begged'' Shamir to accept at least a
personal envoy from U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   This would compromise a Security Council resolution ordering a
three-member delegation to investigate the slayings.
   The television report did not say whether Shamir gave Bush a
written reply or conveyed his message via diplomatic channels.
   Israel is conducting its own investigation into the shooting
deaths of at least 19 Palestinians by Jerusalem police during a
riot at the Temple Mount, a site holy to Moslems and Jews. The
results are expected to be published later in the week.
   Jerusalem, a focal point of the Arab-Israeli conflict, is home
to 350,000 Jews and 150,000 Arabs.

   Two families who suffered casualties of
violent drug trafficking in one of the nation's most active
drug-smuggling corridors joined to observe a national week of
anti-drug activities.
   ``More people are hurt by drugs than just the users,'' said
Helen Kilroy, whose 21-year-old son, Mark, was slain by a cult of
drug smugglers during spring break.
   Kilroy and her husband, James, joined the mother and sister of
drug agent Enrique Camarena, who was tortured and killed by drug
traffickers in Mexico in 1985.
   Camarena's mother, Dora Camarena, and his sister, Myrna
Camarena, participated with the Kiloys in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley's observance of the national ``Red Ribbon'' week on Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday.
   ``Lives have been lost and homes have been broken, leaving
families suffering,'' Dora Camarena told the mostly teen-age crowd
in Spanish.
   Tina Guerra, assistant district supervisor with the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission in McAllen, brought the two families
together.
   ``You should have seen it when these families met for the first
time,'' Guerra said. ``Fate brought them together. You can't
describe it.''
   Camarena's 1985 slaying inspired the Red Ribbon campaign,
sponsored by the National Federation of Parents. Drug traffickers
abducted him in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he worked for the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration.
   His death inspired the best-selling book, ``Desperados,'' and a
television movie.
   Myrna Camarena, an office manager with the DEA in the San Diego,
Calif., area, translated her mother's brief speech.
   ``We're hoping to cause an impact on the community locally and
to help stop the flow of drugs from Mexico,'' she said.
   James Kilroy, who wrote a book about his son's death, says he'll
donate the book's profits to the Mark Kilroy Foundation, a
drug-awareness organization the Kilroys formed.
   ``We really want to do something about this drug problem,'' he
said. ``It's getting worse all the time.''
   The drug smugglers accused of killing Mark Kilroy reportedly
sought occult protection from authorities and rival smugglers by
sacrificing humans.
   Kilroy, who disappeared in the border city of Matamoros, Mexico,
was found buried near the bodies of 14 other people believed to
have been killed by the drug ring.
   The cult's leader, Miami-born Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, and an
associate were killed in a shoot-out with Mexican police in May
1989.
   Other alleged members of the ring are currently being tried in
Mexico.

   President Bush will skip political
fund-raisers in Albuquerque and Phoenix on Thursday in order to
stay here to deal with the budget crisis, the White House announced
Wednesday night.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater expressed optimism
that a deal would be reached with congressional Democrats to cut
the deficit by $500 billion over five years and avoid a Wednesday
night shutdown of government operations.
   Even if the deal is struck Wednesday night, Bush wants to stay
in Washington to encourage Republicans to vote for the package,
Fitzwater said.
   Bush still hopes to leave for Irvine, Calif., later Thursday to
spend the night there and resume the rest of a five-day trip to
California, Hawaii and Oklahoma, he said.
   Bush spent Tuesday on the campaign trail in New England. One of
the Republican congressmen he campaigned for, Rep. Peter Smith of
Vermont, emphasized his disagreements with Bush on civil rights and
taxes. Another, Rep. Bob Smith, the Senate candidate in New
Hampshire, failed to attend the fund-raiser with the president.

   The Senate decisively rejected a move
Wednesday to slap tough new anti-obscenity curbs on the National
Endowment for the Arts and voted instead to penalize artists whose
federally subsidized works are deemed obscene by the courts.
   Ignoring charges by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that the endowment
is financing obscenity produced by ``sleazeballs'' at the
taxpayers' expense, the Senate approved scrapping current
restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for federal support.
   On a 73-24 roll call, the Senate embraced a bipartisan
compromise offered by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that would require
the endowment to recoup its money from grant recipients who are
subsequently convicted of violating obscenity or child pornography
laws.
   Guilty artists would be barred from receiving any new federal
grants for three years.
   The House approved a similar proposal last week as part of its
$11.9 billion version of a fiscal 1991 appropriations bill for the
Interior Department and several other federal agencies, including
the NEA, the Forest Service, the Smithsonian Institution and some
Energy Department programs.
   The Senate version, totaling $11.7 billion and including the NEA
compromise, was approved Wednesday night on a 92-6 roll call.
   The Senate bill contains $170 million for the arts endowment, $5
million less than President Bush had requested and a slight
reduction from the NEA's $171 million budget last year. The House
had voted to boost endowment spending to $180 million.
   Differences between the two measures will have to be reconciled
by House and Senate negotiators before a final bill is sent to the
president for his signature.
   Hatch said his proposal was aimed at ``protecting taxpayer funds
and artists' freedom of expression at the same time.''
   He said Congress must continue to encourage artistic excellence
and diversity through the federal arts agency, and ``I believe we
can do this without compromising the bounds of good taste.''
   Earlier, on a 70-29 roll call, the Senate rejected a Helms
amendment that would have forbidden the endowment to finance works
that ``depict or describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual or
excretory activities or organs.''
   Helms argued that his proposal was aimed at halting ``this
slime, this sleaze'' allegedly produced by artists who receive
federal grants.
   ``The American people are darn well sick of this,'' said Helms,
who grabbed the spotlight as the Senate began debate on a proposed
$170 million appropriation for the fedeal arts agency in the 1991
fiscal year which began Oct. 1.
   ``What is really at stake is whether or not America will allow
the cultural high ground in this nation to sink slowly into an
abyss of slime to placate people who clearly seek or are willing to
destroy the Judaic-Christian foundations of this republic,'' he
said.
   Before the fight was over, the Senate approved a Helms proposal
to forbid the NEA to support any work that ``denigrates the objects
or beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion.
   But Helms was defeated by voice vote in an a separate attempt to
block endowment grants to affluent artists, which his formula
defined as any individual whose annual income is $94,665 or more.
   During the debate, Helms was backed by Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., who proposed abolishing the endowment for what he called
its subsidies of ``frivolity and decadence'' at a time when
Congress is struggling to reduce huge budget deficits.
   Opposing the Helms amendment, Hatch and Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., said it would amount to prior restraint on endowment grant
recipients and probably would be ruled unconstitutional.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that at a time when the
walls of oppression are falling in Eastern Europe, ``it would be
shameful to erect new barriers to freedom of expression'' in
America.
   ``We must resist the call to censorship,'' Kennedy said.
   Helms read his colleagues a list of offensive paintings and
theater performances he accused the endowment of subsidizing. He
said they included a woman who performed ``disgusting live sex
acts'' on a New York stage and an artist who portrayed homosexuals
engaged in ``ultimate excretory acts with one another.''
   Helms said senators who voted for his amendment would be
``voting against the vilest, most crudest material, or the funding
of it.''
   He said his ban would not censor artists but only order them not
to ``try to dip into the public trough to pay for it.''
   The emotional floor battle over the ``obscene art'' issue was
fought over the Senate appropriations bill that earmarked nearly $6
billion for the Interior Department, its biggest beneficiary. It
omits a House-approved one-year moratorium on oil and gas leasing
in many sections of federal offshore waters of the Outer
Continental Shelf.
   On Tuesday night, the Senate rejected a move to bypass the
Endangered Species Act so logging could continue in Pacific
Northwest forest regardless of the impact on the threatened
northern spotted owl, and also rejected a move to cut the Forest
Service road-building effort in half.
   The only votes against the bill came from Helms, Humphrey and
Sens. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.; Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, and William Roth Jr., R-Del.
   Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., did
not vote.
   The current obscenity ban, adopted a year ago under pressure
from Helms and his conservative allies, forbids endowment financing
of works that ``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions
of homoeroticism, sadomasochism, the sexual exploitation of
children or ``individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   The Senate bill also would allow endowment chairman John E.
Frohnmayer to continue his requirement that grant recipients sign a
pledge not to produce obscene work. The pledge has caused
widespread protests among artists and resulted in three lawsuits
challenging its constitutionality.
   By contrast, the House voted to ban Frohnmayer's pledge and to
omit any explicit anti-obscenity restrictions.

   A neighborhood bully was convicted Wednesday of
attempted murder for setting a 12-year-old boy on fire after
forcing him into the basement of an abandoned building and binding
him to a pipe.
   The victim, David Opont, survived but will be scarred for life.
   The 14-year-old defendant, whose name was withheld because of
his age, was found guilty under juvenile law of attempted murder,
kidnapping, assault, robbery, and attempted robbery following a
non-jury trial before Judge Joseph A. Esquirol Jr.
   ``There could be no other conclusion than he secreted (David),
tied him hand and foot and he set him onfire,'' the judge said. He
said the boy ``intended to and did in fact severely and permanently
disfigure David.''
   The teen-ager could be locked up in a juvenile hall for three
years, but the sentence could be extended each year until he was
21. He was also ordered to undergo a series of psychological tests.
   The March 7 incident was a shock to the city and evoked an
outpouring of sympathy and get-well messages from across the
country. While in the hospital, David was visited by former
President Reagan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and entertainment and
sports figures.
   The defendant, who is large for his age, sat impassively at
Wednesday's hearing, occasionally wagging his head from side to
side during the hour-long proceeding. He was returned to the
Spofford Juvenile Detention Center in the Bronx where he has been
held since his arrest on the evening after the attack.
   David and his parents weren't in the courtroom when the judge
returned his verdict.
   The boy later issued a statement through his family that he was
glad to finally put the attack behind him.
   ``I am looking forward to my life and all the challenge it
brings,'' the statement said.
   At the trial, David identified his attacker and testified the
bully had accosted him and his friends a day earlier on a street in
their neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn. On the morning he
was burned, David said, the same boy stopped him and a companion as
they walked to school and searched their pockets for money.
   The older boy then made David go with him into an abandoned
building, bound his hands behind him and set him on fire after
David refused to smoke something the assailant offered him, David
testified.
   David, who moved with his family from Haiti two years ago,
suffered severe burns over much of his body and was initially given
less than a 50 percent chance of survival. After several skin grafs
and a strong recovery, he was released from the hospital in August.
He is still undergoing rehabilitation and will always bear scars
from the attack, the judge said.
   Police initially said David had been torched because he refused
to smoke crack with his assailant, but they later said robbery was
the motive for the attack.
   The teen-ager was known in his neighborhood as a vicious bully
who taunted smaller children and stole their lunch money and other
property.

<HEAD>Alaskan Hopes To Find Market for Glacier Ice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Galen Cook figures glacier ice from his native
Alaska is just what Hawiians and their guests need to keep cool -
or at least to keep their drinks cool.
   Cook has shipped 25 tons of glacier ice to Honolulu to test the
market.
   The city's Waikiki resort area was an ideal test site because of
the large number of Japanese tourists, Cook said. Glacier ice
became a popular novelty item in Japan a couple years ago.
   Glacier ice, compressed over thousands of years, has a clear
prism-like sparkle and is denser than ice produced by refrigerators
or ice machines, Cook said.
   The density means it melts more slowly and doesn't water down
drinks as quickly as regular ice cubes, he said.
   The product has been well received by customers, who say it
doesn't change the taste of their drinks, said Sean Ellis, food and
beverage manager of the Sheraton Moana Surfrider Hotel.
   The Sheraton was Cook's first big customer. He has since
contracted with another Waikiki hotel and a nightclub.
   Cook charges $1 per pound for the ice, which raises the cost of
drinks by about 15 cents a glass, Ellis said.
   Cook said he doesn't know of any other vendors of glacier ice
and his main competition is the ice machine, which can provide
large quantities of ice faster and more cheaply.
   Cook's partner, Al Schafer, has a permit from the state of
Alaska to harvest the free-floating ice that falls from a glacier
near Seward, Cook said.
   The idea came from a term paper Cook wrote at Chaminade
University, where he is working on a master's degree in business
administration.
   ``This is an exercise in marketing mystique,'' Cook said. ``It's
from Alaska, it's from a glacier, and it's from a different time
zone.''

   Benazir Bhutto's party suffered a
stunning defeat at the hands of her right-wing foes in
parliamentary elections Wednesday, according to partial returns.
The electoral rout was widely seen as a verdict on her dismissal as
prime minister.
   She refused to concede defeat late Wednesday, and accused
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the army-backed caretaker
government of large-scale vote-rigging in what most analysts and
opinion polls predicted would be a close contest.
   ``This election is a fraud,'' Ms. Bhutto said, fighting back
tears.
   Her opponents dismissed the charges.
   ``She's a sore loser,'' said Hussein Haqqani, a spokesman for
the caretaker government. ``She's finding it hard to accept that
she's no longer on the pedestal and that she is no longer the
heroine of democracy. After a few days she'll have to accept it.''
   Ms. Bhutto herself ran for two seats. She overwhelmingly won
re-election in Larkana in southern Sind Province but suffered a
humiliating defeat in the northern city of Peshawar, losing by
nearly 12,000 votes.
   She faces trials before special tribunals on corruption charges
and could be denied her seat and banished from politics for seven
years if convicted.
   A spokesman for a 40-member group of international poll watchers
refused comment on the election until the group assembled. Their
assessment could affect hundreds of millions of dollars in vital
U.S. economic and military aid.
   ``I'm angry and shocked at the way elections have been rigged,''
Ms. Bhutto, 37, told reporters in Larkana. ``The president has made
a mockery of these elections. It wasn't even subtle.''
   Ishaq Khan dismissed her government on Aug. 6 after she held
power 20 months. He accused her of heading the most corrupt and
inept government in Pakistan's history.
   Ms. Bhutto said Wednesday, ``Had the counting been done in front
of polling agents, I would have accepted the results. But since the
polling agents were not present and ballot boxes were stolen, I
cannot accept these results.''
   She predicted ``a witch hunt'' against her and her supporters
would follow.
   At least nine people were killed and 66 injured in clashes
between rival parties during the balloting, despite unprecedented
security.
   Election officials said turnout among the estimated 50 million
eligible voters was unusually light - in many places less than 10
percent.
   More than 1,300 candidates vied for 217 seats in the National
Assembly, the policy-making lower house of Parliament that will
choose the next prime minister. Two independent candidates were
elected unopposed. One race was postponed after a candidate was
killed in campaign violence.
   Ishaq Khan and the caretaker government of Prime Minister Ghulam
Mustafa Jatoi portrayed Ms. Bhutto as an enemy of Islam, a traitor
who sold state secrets to neighboring India and an American puppet.
   Their actions seemed to cast her as the victim of ``kangaroo
courts,'' halted her declining popularity and helped galvanize her
party.
   But with 126 of the 214 races declared, the right-wing Islamic
Democratic Alliance won 61 seats. Ms. Bhutto's center-left Pakistan
People's Party and its allies got 26. The rest went to smaller
parties and independent candidates.
   Unofficial reports indicated her party trailing badly in all
four provinces.
   Jatoi and two leaders of the Islamic Democratic Alliance - Nawaz
Sharif and Mohammad Khan Junejo - won their races.
   Hours before results began coming in, Ms. Bhutto predicted her
party would take 120 seats.
   Before voting, she visited her father's grave. Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was overthrown in a bloodless coup in 1977 and
was hanged two years later.
   Ms. Bhutto repeatedly compared her unceremonious dismissal to
his ouster.
   She complained that ballot boxes were stuffed and said she would
meet party leaders this week to decide whether to call street
demonstrations or boycott Parliament.
   Jatoi, in a broadcast announcement before results were
announced, warned that anyone instigating trouble would be ``dealt
with a stern hand.''
   Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who has been jailed for
nearly three weeks on kidnapping and extortion charges, won his bid
to represent the sprawling Karachi slum of Lyari in Parliament but
lost his hometown of Nawabshah. He was defeated there by Murtaza
Jatoi, Jatoi's son.
   Nusrat Bhutto, her mother and a former senior minister, easily
won re-election, even though she has been in Britain since her
daughter's dismissal.
   Wednesday's election was the fifth since Pakistan was created as
a homeland for Moslems in the 1947 partition that ended British
colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent.
   Nearly 100,000 soldiers, paramilitary troops and police
patrolled the most volatile areas Wednesday to prevent violence.
   The People's Party and three smaller allied parties were pitted
against the Islamic Democratic Alliance, a loose-knit coalition of
18 parties united by their dislike for Ms. Bhutto but strained by
individual ambitions.
   The Western-educated Ms. Bhutto became the first woman leader of
a modern Moslem nation in December 1988 following the first free
elections in Pakistan after a decade of military rule.

   A 12-year-old girl was found
locked in a filthy closet and her parents were charged Wednesday
with child endangerment for allegedly keeping her confined most of
her life, police said.
   The girl was found Monday night in a reeking, cockroach-infested
closet kept closed by a bent nail, said Sgt. Jenifer Kauffman.
   Joseph and Sandra Sauceda were charged with felony child
endangerment, and the father also was charged with felony child
abuse, Ms. Kauffman said.
   Police were tipped by a relative. When they asked the Saucedas
to show them the girl, they took officers to the closet, Ms.
Kauffman said.
   Officers said the girl was lying in her own feces and wore a
urine-stained sweatsuit.
   ``Obviously, it's a terrible, traumatic condition,'' said Sgt.
Bob Evans. ``It will probably take years to recover from.''
   The couple was held in this city 60 miles east of Los Angeles in
lieu of $50,000 bail each. Arraignment was set for Thursday.
   The girl and her six brothers and sisters, ages 2 months to 15
years, were turned over to the county Child Protective Services.
There was no evidence that the other children were abused, Ms.
Kauffman said.
   Police said they didn't know why the girl apparently was singled
out for alleged abuse.
   Joseph Sauceda, 33, denied that he and his 31-year-old wife
abused their daughter. He said te closet was not a cell and that
his family was a loving one.
   ``My other girl was playing with her and I guess she locked it
by accident,'' he said in an interview at the county jail Tuesday.
   Police said the child, whose name was withheld, was unusually
thin and bruised after being kept in a 4-foot-by-5-foot closet in a
back bedroom.
   Investigators believe the child rarely left the closet and
probably had been kept locked up at other homes where the family
lived during the past decade, Ms. Kauffman said.
   Police based their belief on comments from relatives and other
evidence at the home, she said.
   ``She was apparently taken out on occasion, but it was not a
consistent activity,'' Ms. Kauffman said. ``For example, recently
she was taken out once a day to go to the bathroom and do some
chores.''
   Although malnourished and slightly bruised, the girl was in
fairly good shape, she added.
   The discovery shocked arresting officers.
   ``This little girl really got to me. I normally don't get
emotional, but what I saw there ... I was not able to tolerate,''
said Cpl. Steve Filson, a 13-year police veteran.
   ``Both myself and my partner there virtually gagged when the
room was opened. There was a very strong urine smell.''
   Neighbors were stunned.
   ``This is making me sick,'' said 18-year-old Joann Banchetto.
``They were good people. I never saw them beat their kids. They've
always treated their kids right.''
   But Ms. Banchetto said some things didn't seem right.
   ``They said they had seven kids,'' Ms. Banchetto said. ``But we
always saw only six. When you'd talk to them, they would barely
peek out of their window.''
   The Saucedas had rented the home for at least seven months,
neighbors said.
   Neighbor Lorina Finley said she once heard a young girl's plea
for food.
   ``I heard a lot of screaming and crying in there. She was just
crying, `I'm hungry, I'm hungry,''' she said.
   Ms. Finley said she also heard Joseph Sauceda shout, ``Shut
up!'''

   Israel rejected an appeal by President Bush to
cooperate with a United Nations investigation, prompting another
U.S. vote against Israel in the U.N. Security Council, U.S.
officials and other sources said Wednesday.
   The vote was on a resolution deploring Israel's rejection of the
inquiry into the slaying of 19 Palestinian Arabs on the Temple
Mount. U.S. officials, declining to be identified, said all other
members of the Security Council were notified ahead of time that
the United States would not veto the resolution.
   The vote was 15-0 in the Security Council, marking the second
time in 10 days the United States voted against its ally.
   The resolution was sponsored primarily by Yemen and other
non-aligned nations. A U.S. veto would have killed the resolution.
   The U.S. decision shows the growing rift between two friendly
governments.
   The United States, through the years, mostly stood by Israel in
rebuffing attacks on its policies and actions in the United
Nations. But after 19 Palestinians were killed by Israeli police in
a riot Oct. 8 the United States drafted a resolution condemning
Israel and calling for an investigation under the supervision of
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The Israeli Cabinet declined to cooperate.
   Bush on Tuesday sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir appealing for cooperation with the investigation, U.S.
officials and other sources said Wednesday.
   While the Israeli leader did not reply in writing, it was made
clear to American diplomats in Washington and in Jerusalem that
Israel's position had not changed, the sources told The Associated
Press.
   Israel's initial decision to rebuff the U.N. inquiry was based
on two principles that still stand, said the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They were that the U.N. Security Council had already reached its
conclusions, condemning Israel before making a factual judgment,
and that the inquiry conflicts with Israel's sovereignty, the
sources said.
   This position was conveyed to U.S. Ambassador William Brown, who
delivered Bush's letter Tuesday in Jerusalem, and by Zalman Shoval,
the new Israeli ambassador, in meetings in Washington with Brent
Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser; Robert
Kimmitt, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, and
Dennis B. Ross, head of the policy planning staff of the State
Department.
   The letter represented a last-ditch attempt by Bush to persuade
Israel to admit the investigators lest it face sterner treatment
from the U.N. Security Council.
   Israeli television, reporting on the letter, quoted unidentified
sources in Washington as saying Bush ``begged'' Shamir to accept at
least a personal envoy from the secretary-general.
   The United States was the principal drafter of the initial
resolution, which condemned Israel for the Oct. 8 slayings. The
Israeli government has initiated its own investigation.
   The sources, declining to be identified, confirmed an account of
Bush's letter published in the New York newspaper Newsday. Later,
Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, confirmed
Bush had written to Shamir about the U.N. inquiry.
   She said Bush also expressed condolences about the violence
between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs and told Shamir it was
``important to all of us to have the focus back on Iraq.''
   She said if Israel complied there would be no point in having a
second resolution approved.
   ``If Prime Minister Shamir agreed to let the Secretary-General's
mission come in it would make null and void the necessity of having
a second resolution,'' she said.
   The Palestinians were slain after police used tear gas and
rubber bullets in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the stoning of
Jews praying at the Western Wall. The attack on the Jews was not
condemned in the resolution.
   The administration, in urging Israel to cooperate with the
inquiry, says it is the only way for the facts to be sorted out.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said if Shamir refused
to cooperate ``the mood of the council will be less solicitous than
if they did.''
   However, he said no resolutions apart from the renewed request
had been prepared for council action.
   Among Israel's reasons for rejecting the investigators is
concern the United Nations is trying to get a foothold in
Jerusalem, the nation's capital. East Jerusalem, the older,
predominantly Arab section of the city, ruled by Jordan for 19
years, was captured by Israeli forces in the 1967 Mideast war and
annexed.
   The United States and nearly all other nations do not recognize
Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
   Several Jews and Arabs have been killed and wounded in the city
since the Oct. 8 melee. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens on
Tuesday barred Palestinians from traveling to Israel from the West
Bank and Gaza, which were also held by the Arabs until Israel's
victory in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   Ms. Tutwiler said, ``we hope that the situation will rapidly
calm down so these measures can be lifted and Israelis and
Palestinians can go about their lives in peace and security, as
they both deserve.''

   Three army generals linked to human
rights abuses under the former military regime are stepping down,
officials and news reports said Wednesday.
   The generals each headed the National Information Center, the
disbanded secret police force known by its Spanish acronym CNI. The
agency has been linked to human rights abuses including the killing
and torture of dissidents and illegal arrests.
   In a brief statement, the army announced the ``voluntary
resignations'' of a total of six army generals. The statement did
not identify the officers, but the local media gave six names.
   Three of the officers, Gens. Hugo Salas, Gustavo Abarzua and
Jorge Iturriaga, headed CNI at different times during the military
rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who led the 1973 coup that ousted
Salvador Allende Gossens, an elected Marxist.
   Pinochet dissolved the CNI shortly before he stepped down in
March and was replaced by his elected President Patricio Aylwin.
   Abarzua was the last head of the CNI; when it was disbanded he
was named chief of army intelligence. Salas' last position was army
chief of staff, and Iturriaga was a division commander.
   Also Wednesday, unidentified military sources quoted by local
new reports said 16 officers were ousted from the army after an
internal investigation showed they participated in an illegal loan
and credit institution.
   Defense Minister Patricio Rojas said the inquiry, ordered by
Pinochet, had ``confirmed the participation of army personnel'' in
the illegal scheme, details of which were unavailable. News reports
said hundreds of officers lost money.
   The state television said that at least 35 other officers are
still being investigated and face ``serious sanctions for breaking
military ethic codes and disicipline.''

   Humphrey the wayward whale swam under the
Golden Gate Bridge Wednesday and headed toward the open sea, ending
a four-day visit that saw one wrong turn after another.
   The 45-ton humpback whale passed under the span about 5 p.m.,
escorted by a flotilla of small boats, Coast Guard vessels and
private cruisers.
   People on the bridge cheered as Humphrey swam by.
   He headed back to the ocean where he belongs a day after he was
freed from a stranding on mud flats along the shore of San
Francisco Bay.
   For a time, the mammoth mammal seemed to be re-enacting his 1985
tour of San Francisco bay. Then, the wayward whale was tracked by
legions of well-wishers as he meandered, far from the open ocean
where he belongs, for 25 days.
   Anxious rescuers tracked the whale through the day as he seemed
to be headed anywhere but out to sea. First he was seen south of
the bridge, then away to the north.
   Rescuers mobilized to intercept the 45-ton whale and try to
induce him to head out to sea, she said. After the 40-foot Humphrey
was freed from the mud flat Tuesday evening he seemed to have
gotten his bearings, raising hopes he would join the rest of his
kind, which feed in the bay sometimes, but seldom stay for long.
   ``He was swimming well and going toward the Golden Gate,''
Denize Springer of the California Marine Mammal Center said early
in the day. ``Well, he wasn't really going in just one direction.
Whales tend to meander.''
   Humphrey, for some reason attracted to San Francisco Bay, has a
history of meandering.
   In 1985, when the news media gave him his name, he went through
the bay and up the Sacramento River, with much of the nation
tracking his wanderings.
   On Sunday, Humphrey veered off course again, turning left into
San Francisco Bay as his fellow migrating whales continued south
along the West Coast.
   He spnnt about 24 hours stuck on the mud flat before the Coast
Guard, the incoming tide and a crowd of cheering spectators helped
shake him loose Tuesday afternoon.
   Experts could only speculate about why Humphrey went off course.
   ``Your guess is as good as mine. But my guess is something's
wrong with this guy,'' said Brian Gibeson, a marine biologist at
the California Academy of Sciences.
   It could be that a parasite has affected his brain or
rudimentary inner ear, Gibeson said, making Humphrey ``like a car
with his wheels out of alignment.''

   The company that created the Love Canal
toxic-waste dump ignored its own employees' warnings and sold the
filled-in site to a school board without explaining the dangers, a
state lawyer charged Wednesday.
   Also at the start of a trial over liability for cleanup costs,
the president of that company's parent apologized for the problems
the dump created. But a company lawyer argued it didn't hide
conditions at the site.
   Hooker Chemicals &amp; Plastics Corp. built the dump in 1942 and
sold the land to the Niagara Falls school board in 1953.
   Toxic chemicals eventually leaked into basements and backyards
of a middle-class neighborhood built on the dump and made Love
Canal a symbol of America's toxic-waste problems in the late 1970s.
About 2,500 people fled their homes.
   The state is seeking $250 million in punitive damages against
Occidental Chemical Corp., which bought Hooker in 1968. The state
contends Hooker recklessly failed to take care of the dangers at
the site or warn others about them.
   The company argues that the federal, state and Niagara Falls
municipal governments and the city's school board share liability.
   Two former Love Canal residents were called as the state's first
witnesses.
   Peter T. Bulka Jr., a former Niagara Falls policeman, told how
children on a Little League team he coached discovered
``volcanoes'' in the outfield of a baseball diamond built on the
dump.
   ``We found two places where the ground was mounded up and stuff
was spewing up from the middle,'' Bulka said.
   Timothy Moriarty, who grew up in one of the first houses built
in the area, said he remembered seeing at least two fires at the
dump in the early 1950s, throwing flames 10 to 20 feet in the air.
   He also said city garbage trucks occasionally used the dump, as
well as Hooker.
   Eugene Martin-Leff, the state's lead trial lawyer, charged
Hooker's own employees warned of a ``quagmire'' at the site and
urged it not be sold to the school board because of the 21,800 tons
of buried toxic chemicals.
   ``Conscience told Hooker to safeguard this dangerous place so
people could not come in contact with the dangerous poisons inside
it,'' Martin-Leff said in his opening argument to U.S. District
Judge John T. Curtin, who is hearing the case without a jury.
   ``But the narrow voice of self-interest said, `Don't spend money
to install a fence,' ... and later, `Go ahead and sell the site so
other people can take care of it,' '' Martin-Leff said.
   Thomas H. Truitt, Occidental's lawyer, argued that Hooker
adhered to the standards of the day when it built the dump and
should not be judged through the ``hauntingly seductive lens of
hindsight.''
   ``The central issue in this case is not whether all the
decisions are correct. Many were; some were not,'' Truitt said.
``But, (the issue is) whether we ... can go back to the 1940s and
1950s and place these decisions in the context in which they were
made.''
   Truitt said the company had given the school board full notice
that dangerous chemicals were buried beneath the property when the
board asked about buying it for construction of an elementary
school. He said the company included that warning in the deed.
   ``The deed says `May cause injury or death,' '' Truitt said. ``I
believe `death' is fair notice to any person.''
   In fact, the deed does not use the words ``may cause injury or
death.'' But it does say ``waste products resulting from the
manufacturing of chemicals'' are buried on the site and absolves
Hooker of liability for injury, death or property damage they
cause.
   The trial is expected to last at least two years. Opening day
brought nearly 100 spectators to the federal courthouse. Thirty-two
lawyers and aides packed the counsel tables and spilled over into
the jury box.
   Evidence includes up to 1 million pages of documents. A computer
was installed in the courtroom to keep track of all the paperwork.
   Before opening arguments, Occidental Chemical President Roger
Hirl apologized for Love Canal. ``We do feel badly about it,'' he
told reporters. ``We apologize to all those who suffered because of
it.''
   Occidental does not dispute that Hooker dumped 21,800 tons of
dioxin, pesticide byproducts and other chemicals, some of them
highly toxic, in an abandoned canal bed dug in the 1890s by
entrepreneur William Love.
   The Dallas-based company paid $20 million in 1984 to settle a
separate lawsuit brought by 1,345 former Love Canal residents.

<TEXT>
   Yves Saint Laurent's show of luxury summer
ready-to-wear Wednesday was a puzzling affair, capping a hectic
week of presentations.
   The great fashion master made a splash with his fabulous
harem-pants evening wear based on the Scheherezade-style costumes
of the turn-of-the-century Ballets Russes designer, Leon Bakst.
   The party clothes looked either sexy or downright wanton.
Billowing pants in light chiffons and crepe de chines came out in
busy, colorfully theatrical prints.
   They were topped by everything from bare bosoms adorned with
beads to beaded pointed bras or sequined boleros, heads coiffed
with tasseled silk fez hats.
   Audience reactions to the show were mixed. Some spoke of Saint
Laurent's superb mastery of colors, others muttered about
vulgarity.
   It was all of that. Conventional daytime styles in classic good
taste vied for attention with flounced, ruffled, feathered
leg-baring numbers more appropriate for the Lido than the sleek
crowd Saint Laurent usually caters to.
   Backstage, the 54-year-old couturier was enthusiastically
embraced by famous friends like Paloma Picasso and Catherine
Deneuve. But, having been through a bout of nervous fatigue and
rest cure several months ago, Saint Laurent still looked pale and
shaky.
   And that was the unsettling mood of the whole collection, which
wavered between a sure approach in color and cut and an attempt to
redeem it all with forced injections of color, lace and sparkles,
and views of skin.
   Nevertheless, there were a lot of saleable items offered, in a
considerably softened daytime silhouette, the current new Paris
mood.
   Mariner styles with easy jackets, small-striped navy and white
tee shirts, fitted tunics and tank tops, minis and shorts with
yachting caps or long-billed sunhats could certainly be worn
jauntily anywhere.
   Saint Laurent is going in for lots of sportswear, evident in the
opening of his new left-bank shop for his lower-priced line called
``Variations,'' where his original Rive Gauche shop was. Even
there, prices are high for American purses, with a silk shirt going
for about $300.
   He showed many straight and narrow pants, emphasizing the
newly-softened silhouette. Shoulder padding, when it appears, is
softly rounded, as in the moderate batwing-sleeved absinthe green
belted trench with gold-buttoned raw silk pants the color of orange
sherbet, worn with a collar-less mustard-yellow satin shirt.
   In the easier, fluid line, Saint Laurent also showed charming
modified A-line sailor dresses, a beautiful brick linen coat
without buttons just outlining the body over pants and a blouse,
and a lot of babydoll dresses, sometimes in hot fuchsia shades,
strapless or off-one-shoulder and plastered with a lace band around
the bust.
   The white silk and lace fitted blazer with full ivory silk pants
was fine, as was the classic short-skirted black tuxedo suit, the
jacket piped in a curve of satin.
   The trouble with the collection was that it often fell into a
rather boring mode, perhaps reflecting Saint Laurent's recent
depression. The charcoal trouser and skirt suits were well-cut, if
somewhat severe, balanced by a line of flowing silky crepe numbers
in browns, beiges or dusty pastels.
   But as Saint Laurent harked back to his own corselet dresses,
the little black lacy lingerie dresses, and the busy look of red
organza or zany ostrich-feather puffs to pep up the party, one
longed for the authoritative ``old'' Saint Laurent, who didn't need
to try so hard to offer fun.
   That man knew how to make a simple cocktail dress and jacket
sexy, without having to revert to attention-grabbing frou-frou.
   Some admirers wish for nothing more than his former sure-footed,
creative elegance - long the hallmark of YSL.

   When disc jockey Debbie Dixon returns to
the Persian Gulf to resume her radio show, she'll be armed with
tapes from the Grand Ole Opry which she'll dedicate to U.S. troops.
   Dixon, 28, has a one-hour country music show every Thursday
afternoon on QBS, a government-owned station in Doha, Qatar.
   The show, which is heard in Saudi Arabia and possibly in Kuwait,
features country songs to entertain Americans living in the Middle
East and to give natives exposure to American culture, she says.
   ``Everyone can relate to country music even though they've never
been in a honky-tonk or don't know what a longneck is,'' Dixon said
in an interview Wednesday. ``I hope it gives a good view of the
American style of music.''
   She said her show has been popular since it first aired in
January.
   ``Our abassador has mentioned that people are listening,'' she
said.
   Dixon is married to an engineer with an oil company in Qatar.
She left the region after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, because of
uncertainty in the region. But she said she's returning Friday
because U.S. troops are there.
   The station has played reruns of her shows since she left.
   When she returns, Opry officials have agreed to send tapes to
play for her mostly Moslem audience.
   ``We're pleased and honored that our entertainment can carry
that far,'' said Opry spokesman Tom Adkinson. ``This is a sterling
addition to our 65th birthday celebration.''

<HEAD>Anti-Terrorism Bill Passed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress on Wednesday approved and sent to
President Bush legislation aimed at improving the security of air
travelers against terrorism.
   The bill, which grew out of recommendations of a commission that
studied the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing, authorizes up to $7
million for security improvements in the fiscal year which began
Oct. 1.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner welcomed the action and
said he would recommend that President Bush sign it.
   Skinner, in a statement, called the measure ``a signficant
milestone for ... the families of the victims of the Pan Am 103
tragedy ... and everyone who flies.''
   Paul Hudson, chairman of the families' group, ``Families of Pan
Am 103-Lockerbie,'' said in a statement families of the victims
``feel elated and relieved.''
   The bill would require the government to issue guidelines for
warning passengers of potential terrorist threats, would create a
new post at the Transportation Department to press for security
improvements and would require intelligence agencies to share
terrorism information with the department.
   Rather than face a veto, the House and Senate amended the bill
to give the administration flexibility to decide whether to force
airlines to buy and use expensive explosive detection devices
widely criticized for unreliability.
   The Federal Aviation Administration wanted to make airlines
acquire 150 of the ``thermal neutron analysis'' devices at a total
cost of $175 million and deploy them at 15 international airports
in the United States and 25 abroad.
   But a test of the device by a presidential commission that
investigated the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, showed
that it could not detect an amount of plastic explosive like that
used in the bombing and also avoid false alarms.
   The final bill allows the FAA to order limited use of the
devices, but only for 18 months until better technology is
developed.
   Many of the reforms called for in the bill already have been put
in place by the government, and Skinner said the measure would
ensure that the changes are lasting.

<HEAD>Casket Salesman Pleads Innocent to Theft Charge for Dumping
Cadavers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY BENJAMINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A freelance undertaker accused of dumping
cadavers from a medical school in a mass grave and pocketing the
money he was paid to cremate them pleaded innocent Wednesday to a
felony theft charge.
   Prosecutors said they planned more charges against Richard
Joseph Herrin, owner of the Continental Casket Store and
Continental Cremation Services.
   Assistant District Attorney Jean Spradling Hughes said Herrin,
44, would be charged within the next week.
   She refused to specify the charges, but Herrin's attorney, Jack
Kennedy, said the charges would include fraud, wiretapping and
making terrorist threats against area funeral homes.
   Kennedy said Herrin would plead innocent to all the charges.
   The felony theft charge stems from an agreement Herrin had with
the Texas Chiropractic College in Pasadena.
   The college paid him $189 per body to dispose of cadavers
donated to the school's anatomy laboratory. Texas law requires that
the cadavers be cremated or buried in a cemetery, but prosecutors
say Herrin dumped the bodies illegally.
   Forty-four cadavers and body parts were recovered last week from
a field.
   Judge George Godwin ordered Herrin to remain in custody until
another court hearing next week.
   ``I am concerned about the possibility of additional charges,''
Godwin said in denying bond.
   Herrin has contracts with several area funeral homes and
arranges burials or cremations for his customers.
   His funeral director's license was revoked by the Texas Funeral
Commission in 1988 amid allegations he was using his apartment to
improperly dispose of fetuses from an abortion clinic. The
allegations were never proven.
   Herrin has said he has been harassed by the funeral industry
because the prices for the caskets he sells are much lower thanthose sold
through funeral homes.
   ``There is a great deal of bitterness between (Herrin) and the
funeral industry because he undercuts their business by selling
caskets for $700 or $800,'' Kennedy said.

   The White House shook its finger Wednesday at
Republican candidates who publicly oppose the president on major
issues, but at the same time said they are free to ``say whatever
they want.''
   ``If they can sleep with their conscience, let them try,'' said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Venting frustration with GOP discontent toward Bush's policies,
Fitzwater initially said that Republicans who speak out against the
president would be subject to unspecified penalties.
   But he later said he was kidding, and meant to suggest ``they
would suffer in their private purgatories.''
   Fitzwater said that Bush has crisscrossed the country in support
of GOP candidates, raising some $80 million for their campaigns.
   ``Some candidates have asked for us back five or six times. To
suggest they don't want us is pure baloney,'' Fitzwater told his
daily White House news briefing.
   The spokesman also expressed pique at a memo by Edward J.
Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee.
   In the memo, Rollins reportedly suggested that GOP congressional
candidates put distance between themselves and the president if
they felt it to be politically helpful.
   The White House was ``less than enthusiastic'' about the memo,
Fitzwater said.
   Rollins defended his advice. ``The GOP is a diverse party with
diverse views which we tolerate and encourage,'' he said.
   He minimized the memo, saying it was a common practice to advise
candidates on Washington issues.
   ``We advised candidates not to abandon their previous positions
even if it meant opposing the bipartisan budget summit agreement,''
he said. That advice, Rollins continued, ``was hardly unique.''
   Asked if Republican candidates who oppose Bush on key policy
issues would be penalized, Fitzwater said, ``absolutely, but we
never discuss it in public.''
   What might that punishment entail?
   ``I can't tell you. If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise,''
Fitzwater said.
   However, he later told reporters he did not mean to suggest that
there would be actual retaliation against rebellious Republicans.
   ``The president has never been one for retribution. He
understands candidates sometimes have to take differing positions.
Nevertheless, he'd like to see strong support,'' Fitzwater said.
   As he campaigns around the country, Bush increasingly has
encountered GOP candidates who disagree with him on taxes and other
issues.
   For instance, on Tuesday, Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., introduced
Bush at a fund-raising dinner in Burlington by telling his audience
that he disagreed with Bush on taxes and the president's civil
rights veto. Smith is running for re-election.
   Then, in Manchester, N.H., Republican Bob Smith didn't even show
up for Bush's appearance in the lawmaker's Senate campaign. He
begged pressing action in the House in Washington.
   Fitzwater said he would not fault either candidate, claiming
that Bob Smith did have important reasons for remaining in
Washington; and that Peter Smith had been a chief ally of the
president on many issues, including an earlier budget proposal.
   The White House spokesman was asked whether candidates who
disagree with Bush should refrain from criticizing administration
policies in his presence.
   ``Candidates can say whatever they want. They ask us to be
there. We wouldn't be there if they didn't want us. Most of them
have asked us to come two or three times.''
   However, candidates can say whatever they want only at some
future peril, the spokesman then hinted.
   Bush plans 14 fund-raising appearances between now and Election
Day on behalf of GOP candidates and is leaving on Thursday on a
five-day swing that will take him as far west as Hawaii.
   Rollins's memo, reported in Wednesday's editions of the
Washington Post, suggested that GOP candidates could walk away from
some unpopular Bush positions if they found it to their political
advantage.
   ``Do not hesitate to oppose either the president or proposals
being advanced in Congress'' calling for tax increases, the memo
said, even though it contained no specific criticism of Bush, the
newspaper reported.

<HEAD>Residents Squawk At $200,000 To Remove Pigeon Droppings From Town
Hall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-described ``bunch of frugal
Yankees'' donned protective suits emblazoned with the words
``Pigeon Busters'' and offered to shovel pigeon droppings out of
the Town Hall attic for free.
   Town officials plan to spend up to $200,000 removing the
droppings and already have spent about $10,000 on a consultant and
preparation of bids for an elaborate removal plan.
   The residents met with Town Manager Barry Del Castilho this
week.
   ``We wanted to let the selectmen know it's all a lot of poop to
us,'' David Keenan, a building contractor and realtor, said
Tuesday.
   Selectmen open their Town Meeting next week and will have the
final say on the pigeon droppings. They have endorsed the proposed
expenditure, but they also urged Del Castilho to consider the offer
as an alternative.
   The town is to open bids on the project on Monday.
   Keenan said his five-person crew would remove the droppings
without charge and even nail the windows shut so pigeons can't get
back into the attic.
   Keenan said he and other local contractors, including some
licensed to remove asbestos, had tried unsuccessfully for months to
get officials in the college town to consider cheaper alternatives
for removing the droppings.
   ``Sometimes they just intellectualize things to death,'' he
said. ``It's typical of them to take a little pigeon droppings and
blow it up into a national project with studies and experts.''

<HEAD>Ornithologists Excited Over Rare Bird Find</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ornithologists were elated this week
by the sighting of an elusive night parrot, a species that hasn't
been seen, officially, in nearly 80 years.
   That's the good news.
   The bad is that the emerald green and yellow-spotted bird was
found dead at the side of a roadway in Queensland state, the likely
victim of a car's windshield.
   ``I was just standing there and I looked down at my feet and
there it was,'' said Walter Boles, an ornithologist at the
Australian Museum, in an interview Thursday in the Sydney Morning
Herald.
   The night parrot was considered by some experts to be extinct,
with the last official sighting in 1912 in Western Australia state.
The bird first was collected on the edge of the Simpson Desert in
South Australia state by explorer John Stuart in 1845.
   The species is strictly nocturnal and lives on the ground in the
desert, flying only when disturbed, Boles said.
   He was returning from a two-month museum expedition to Western
Australia when his group stopped to look at some other birds on the
road south of Mount Isa, about 940 miles northwest of Brisbane.
   Boles said he was standing near his vehicle by the roadside,
waiting for a second vehicle to catch up, when he spotted the
bird's corpse at his feet.
   ``I knew what it was straight away,'' said Boles. ``I picked it
up and casually showed it to Wayne Longmore (an associate). He just
yelled ... over and over for the next 10 minutes.''
   The discovery may cost Australian Geographic publisher Dick
Smith $39,000. Last year he offered that reward - 50,000 Australian
dollars - for conclusive evidence the night parrot still existed.
   One condition of the reward was that the bird not be ``killed
purposely.'' A magazine official said Thursday that since the
vehicle that hit the parrot probably did not do so purposely, the
reward would likely be paid once the dead bird's identity is
verified.

<HEAD>U.S. Joins U.N. in Public Rebuke of Israel over Palestinian Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States on Wednesday joined with
14 other Security Council members in voting unanimously to rebuke
Israel for rejecting a U.N. mission to investigate the killings of
Palestinians at the Temple Mount.
   Israel denounced the resolution in advance, said it would not
cooperate and termed the U.N. council hypocritical.
   The United States, sending a public signal of displeasure to
Israel, refrained from exercising a veto that would have shielded
Israel from censure. It was the second time in 10 days that the
United States had joined in voting against its ally. The vote of
the 15-member council was unanimous.
   The United States had been under intense pressure from Arab and
other states not to veto the resolution and risk eroding the
fragile U.S.-led coalition against Iraq.
   Western diplomats said they hoped the council decision would
shift the Arab-Israeli issue from centerstage and return the
international spotlight to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But
some Arab diplomats appeared determined to maintain the focus on
Israel and press for action.
   After the vote, Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein said the
Security Council exercised a double standard. He said recent deaths
in Lebanon's civil strife occurred without council condemnation.
   ``I heard not one word in the Security Council about Jews being
killed,'' he said.
   He depicted Israel as the ``victim'' of the U.S. effort ``to
keep the coalition against Saddam Hussein intact.''
   Bein, however, said he does not foresee a major strain in
U.S.-Israeli relations.
   ``We feel that the U.S. and others have done something wrong,''
he said, ``But we are their best ally.''
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering left the Security Council
without making a speech or commenting to reporters.
   The United States had tried unsuccessfully for a week to
persuade Israel to accept a U.N. probe. The U.S. vote came after
President Bush sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, urging him at the last minute to cooperate with a U.N.
investigation. Israel refused.
   The resolution, which is considered binding, was greatly
watered-down in order to avert a U.S. veto. It ``deplores'' the
refusal of the Israeli government to receive the mission, urges it
to reconsider and ``insists'' it permit the secretary-general's
team to visit.
   It requests the secretary-general to submit a report on the
killings. Council members said in a non-binding statement last week
that the report should recommend how to protect Palestinians in the
Occupied Territories.
   British Ambassador David Hannay, president of the council for
October, said ``the issue (of treatment of Palestinians) is not
going to go away from the council agenda.'' He said he did not
anticipate sanctions against Israel for rejecting the U.N. mission.
   ``The principal loser by not receiving the U.N. mission will be
Israel,'' he said.''
   Envoys of China, France and the Soviet Union - the other
permanent Security Council members along with the United States and
Britain - also did not deliver speeches or commenting.
   Even before the vote, Israel rejected the U.N. resolution and
repudiated any U.N. mission, as a violation of its sovereignty,
U.S. officials in Washington said.
   The resolution was approved after a week of consultations and
amendments aimed at averting a U.S. veto by softening the
resolution. It substituted the word ``insists'' for the word
``demands'' and deleted reference to a U.N. Charter provision that
requires all member to obey Security Council resolutions.
   But Israel said the council is hypocritical and biased against
Israel, while ignoring Arab violence against Israelis. It said that
approval of the resolution could open the way to greater council
involvement with the Occupied Territories and calls for U.N.
observers and peacekeepers.
   Israel calls any mission a violation of its sovereignty over
East Jerusalem where the killings of at least 19 Palestinians
occurred two weeks ago. Security forces opened fire after
Palestinians rioted and stoned Jewish worshippers at the Western
Wall.
   Israel has said it would give the United Nations its own inquiry
into the deaths, which followed the stoning by Palestinians of Jews
praying at the Western Wall - known commonly in the West as the
Wailing Wall. But the secretary-general has said he wants to
prepare a report based on his own investigation and will not send a
team unless Israel cooperates.
   On Oct. 12, the Security Council condemned the violence by
Israeli defense forces and endorsed the U.N. Secretary-General's
plan to investigate the deaths. In a non-binding statement, the
president of the council said the 15 members want a report in which
the secretary-general makes suggestions for the protection of
Palestinians in the Occupied Territories.
   The council includes the five permanent members with veto power,
and the non-permanent members: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia,
Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake
spooked tourists and loosened rockslides that blocked roads, the
second time this year that natural disaster has blocked access to
the park.
   Some tourists said they were jolted awake by the 5.8-magnitude
quake about 11:15 p.m. Tuesday that was felt as far away as San
Francisco and in northern Nevada casinos.
   No injuries were reported and damage apparently was limited to
the closure of three of four roads leading into Yosemite.
   Also Wednesday, a quake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale
jiggled southern Illinois. It rattled windows, woke residents and
roused pets into a frenzy, but no damage was reported.
   Roads into Yosemite were closed for 11 days this summer when
forest fires burned out of control. Bureaucratic wrangling in
Washington over the federal budget closed the park to campers
during the Columbus Day weekend.
   ``It comes in threes,'' said Jane van den Hoek, who said she was
inside her trailer when she was jarred by the quake.
   Van den Hoek, of Rancho Palos Verdes, said campers started
packing up and leaving the park soon after the temblor.
   Raymond Grant of Prince Edward Island, Canada, waited until
daybreak Wednesday to leave, cutting by several days his visit to
the park known for its majestic vistas and waterfalls tumbling from
huge granite monoliths.
   ``My wife said we're getting out of here as soon as possible,''
Grant said.
   Spokeswoman Mallory Smith said visitors were full of talk of the
quake Wednesday, but there was no mass exodus and travelers
continued to enter the park on Highway 41, which remained open.
   ``Some visitors, especially from foreign countries and other
states who haven't felt very many earthquakes tended to be very
frightened,'' Smith said.
   National Park Service crews worked to clear several granite
boulders about 50 tons each that tumbled onto highways 41 and 120
about a half mile from each other on the park's western edge.
   Workers lopped off a piece of boulder jutting onto Highway 140
and opened the road leading into the west side of the park late
Wednesday afternoon, said a dispatcher for the state Department of
Transportation.
   Highway 120, which cuts through the park, also was closed on
both the park's east and west sides after the quake.
   The east entrance was opened later Wednesday. But the slide on
the west side of Highway 120 wrecked a 3-foot section of the roaday
and destroyed part of a retaining road, said ranger Scot Bowen. It
was not expected to open until Nov. 2.
   The quake was centered at Lee Vining, a small Mono County town
east of Yosemite National Park and about 190 miles southeast of San
Francisco.
   The quake was felt by gamblers at Nevada casinos in South Lake
Tahoe and Reno and by residents in a wide area including Manteca,
Modesto, Sacramento and Stockton.
   Mono County Sheriff's Deputy Suzanne Sturdivant said the quake
lasted about 45 seconds.
   In Nevada, residents of Reno and Carson City reported rattling
windows, swinging lamps and pictures falling off walls.
   ``I never felt anything like it. There was a total rolling
motion for about 1{ minutes,'' said Mary Biber, a disc jockey at
radio station KPTL in Carson City.
   The Illinois quake was the second quake in the area in less than
a month but was not linked to the New Madrid fault, said
geophysicist Paul Heigold of Illinois Geological Survey in
Champaign.
   A climatologist, Iben Browning, has predicted a major earthquake
is 50 percent likely along the New Madrid fault, which runs from
Marked Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill., on Dec. 3.
   Last week, that prediction was rejected by an advisory panel to
the U.S. Geological Survey. The scientists said that while people
in the region should prepare for the long-term possibility of a
major quake along the New Madrid fault, Browning's prediction is
without scientific basis.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to
ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one
represents a tenfold increase of magnitude. A quake of magnitude 5
is capable of considerable damage, and a magnitude 6 quake can
cause severe damage.

   Several Westerners who were held hostage in Iraq said Wednesday
that their captors starved them and refused them medical attention,
prompting a brief riot at one strategic site.
   The accounts came as separate groups of British and American
hostages arrived in London following their release Tuesday. The 32
Britons and 14 Americans were among hundreds of Westerners held by
Baghdad since its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Two senior officials told Congress that the release of the
hostages, and an agreement to free Frenchmen held in Iraq and
Kuwait, were part of a broad effort by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to weaken the resolve of his opponents by dangling the
possibility of hostage releases.
   In Saudi Arabia, King Fahd expressed his ``firm and
unchangeable'' stand that Iraq should withdraw from Kuwait
unconditionally. It was the second day the Saudis had sought to
quell reports that they want Kuwait to grant territorial
concessions to Baghdad to prevent war.
   Crude oil prices again rose above $30 per barrel in trading
Wednesday as speculators grew more pessimistic about a solution to
the gulf crisis. Light sweet crude closed up $1.71 to $31.08 for
December delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Nine of the freed Americans arrived in London on Wednesday and
were to fly home Thursday.
   The other five flew to New York on a flight with a stopover in
Amsterdam. They appeared healthy and in good spirits when they
disembarked at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
   Jack Frazier, of Santa Ana, Calif., said leaving other hostages
behind ``was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.''
   The leader of an American peace group, meanwhile, said he was
optimistic that more Americans would be released by Friday.
   C. Douglas Hosdetter, head of a delegation from the Fellowship
of Reconciliation, said his group met with middle-level Iraqi
officials in Baghdad and received ``no absolute commitment, but we
are very hopeful.''
   Iraq also released 25 Portuguese stone masons Wednesday, a week
after they finished work on a palace for Saddam.
   Britain's foreign secretary denounced the piecemeal releases as
``grisly and repulsive,'' and said Bitain would not be blackmailed
into softening its stance against Baghdad.
   In contrast to the piecemeal release of others, all French
citizens were to be freed. Iraq's ambassador to France, Abdul
Razzak al-Hachimi, said Wednesday that all 327 French citizens in
Iraq and Kuwait could leave within two days.
   Iraq is attempting to splinter the international coalition
against Saddam by using Western hostages as bargaining chips,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary Richard
Cheney told lawmakers Wednesday.
   Saddam has invited the foreign ministers of Canada and Germany
to come to Baghdad in recent days, holding out the promise that
some of their citizens could also be released, the two Cabinet
members told lawmakers.
   The overtures failed, but are signs Saddam would like to weaken
Western resolve by manipulating the hostages he holds, the two
officials said in a closed-door briefing for lawmakers, according
to sources present.
   In Cairo, Egypt, Soviet envoy Yevengy Primakov met for 90
minutes with President Hosni Mubarak's chief political aide
Wednesday to discuss the gulf crisis.
   Primakov, who earlier persuaded Saddam to allow the evacuation
of about 5,000 Soviets from Iraq, said he may return to Baghdad to
meet again with Saddam.
   Some returning Western hostages described abysmal conditions in
Iraq, such as lack of food and inadequate toilet facilities.
   ``We were in really bad shape,'' freed Briton Jim Thompson told
reporters on the flight home from Iraq. He said meals consisted of
rice and stale bread.
   Thompson, 50, an engineering company manager, said he was among
15 foreigners held as ``human shields'' at an Iraqi armaments
factory. Saddam has kept some Western detainees at strategic
locations to guard against attack.
   ``We told the guards, unless you do something ... we are going
to have a disturbance,'' Thompson said.
   He said that when nothing was done, the detainees tore down
fences, broke windows, daubed anti-Saddam remarks on walls and
shouted anti-Saddam slogans until guards forced them back into
their rooms at gunpoint.
   He said the riot occurred Sept. 29 and also involved American,
Japanese, German and French detainees. He did not say where the
factory was located.
   London sales executive John York, a diabetic, said the Iraqis
denied him insulin.
   Doctors on the flight said the sick included people suffering
from a variety of illnesses including cancer, heart trouble,
diabetes, liver complaints, punctured eardrums, epilepsy and
stress.
   Dr. Ronald Eccles, who was detained in Iraq while on a
physiology lecture tour, warned of health problems among those
still trapped in Iraq.
   ``There are a lot of stress-related diseases coming out,'' said
Eccles, 42, who suffers from severe arthitis.
   ``Everybody was getting upset. You start to get angry, but you
don't know where to direct it. It's a bit dangerous to start taking
it out against the Iraqi soldiers.''
   One hostage en route to Baghdad airport to join the British
flight was killed in a fatal car accident, the British Foreign
Office said. He was identified as Alexander Duncan, 19, an Oxford
University student.
   The nine freed Americans who arrived in London had little to say
to reporters. ``They asked us very nicely not to say anything,''
said Peter Timko, from Pennsylvania.
   John Charlton, 19, from Tampa, Fla., said the detainees didn't
have much warning before they were told they could leave.
   ``It was just a few hours, pretty sudden,'' he said. ``I was
never scared, except the invasion was a little scary, but that's
about it.''
   The British Foreign Office says about 800 Britons remain in Iraq
and another 650 in Kuwait. About 1,000 Americans are in Iraq and
Kuwait, and the State Department said Tuesday that 63 of those have
health problems.
   The U.S. ambassador-designate to Kuwait, Edward Gnehm Jr., said
Wednesday the Iraqis are trying to starve diplomats inside the
besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait. But the diplomats are surviving on
cans of tuna fish and water boiled from the compound's swimming
pool, Gnehm told reporters in Bahrain.
   In Washington, the State Department said U.S. diplomats in
Kuwait had discovered water from a surprise source - a shallow well
dug in the back yard. The water has been used for long overdue
baths and to clean clothes, department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler
said.

<HEAD>Contributors Seeking $757 Million In Civil Trial Against PTL
Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after Jim Bakker was sentenced
to 45 years in prison, a civil trial opened Wednesday in which PTL
contributors seek more than $757 million from their former leader.
   In opening arguments, an attorney for the contributors told the
jury the PTL founder committed ``management fraud'' when he enticed
his followers to send him money.
   ``We represent some 145,000 investors who were told that for a
$1,000 investment they would receive the right to stay for four
days and three nights in ... (PTL) hotels,'' attorney Tom Anderson
said in U.S. District Court.
   Bakker lawyer Jim Toms told the jury that the people suing
Bakker now are the same ones who gladly sent him money years ago.
   ``The constituency of PTL, including the lifetime partners,
wanted Jim and (his wife) Tammy Bakker to prosper. And they didn't
hide their lifestyle.''
   Toms said Bakker was a visionary and said that visionaries often
make mistakes before they eventually succeed.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1987 on behalf of the contributors -
also called PTL partners - several months after Bakker resigned
from his religious empire in the wake of a money and sex scandal.
The scandal began when it was revealed Bakker had sex with former
church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   In the suit, thousands of former PTL partners accused Bakker of
conspiring with others to fraudulently raise million of dollars and
misuse PTL money. Most of the lifetime partners sent Bakker $1,000
in exchange for offers of lodging at the Heritage U.S.A. retreat
south of Charlotte.
   The suit also alleges a conspiracy by Bakker and other PTL
officials, accountants and others to launder money so Bakker and
his top aides could spend it on themselves.
   ``They (plaintiffs) were told this was a wise investment,''
Anderson said. ``Jim Bakker said on television that if we go over
the limit we'll refund your money.''
   Other defendants are former PTL board member Aimee Cortese and
Roe Messner, PTL's chief builder. Two auditing firms retained by
PTL, Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Laventhol &amp; Horwath also are
named as defendants.
   The suit alleges the two firms oversaw a secret bank account
that was used to pay Bakker and others millions of dollars in
bonuses at PTL.
   Bakker, 50, is serving a 45-year sentence in a Minnesota prison.
He was convicted last October on charges of fraud and conspiracy,
and his appeal is scheduled for later this month before the 4th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.
   U.S. District Judge James McMillan approved a motion to have
Bakker brought back to North Carolina if the plaintiffs agree to
pick up his expenses.
   The judge also said Bakker's former top lieutenant at PTL,
Richard Dortch, would testify. Dortch is serving 2{ years in a
Florida prison camp after pleading guilty to fraud and conspiracy.
Dortch's testimony against Bakker in the first trial helped send
the PTL leader to prison.
   Byron Attridge, the attorney for Leventhol &amp; Horwath, told the
jury his client was unaware of any overselling of lifetime
partnerships. He introduced to the jury the team of accountants who
performed PTL's audits, warning jurors against falling victim to a
strategy of ``guilt by association.''
   Jim Williams, who represents Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, said the
plaintiffs would be unable to prove his clients knew about any
fraud at PTL.
   ``Deloitte was not in the crystal ball business, nor should it
have been,'' Williams said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a defense bill Wednesday
night that slashes President Bush's budget request for Star Wars
and barely keeps alive the B-2 stealth bomber program.
   By a vote of 271-156, the House adopted the bill despite
Republican doubts that it meets the Pentagon's needs for the
pot-Cold War era and Democrats' concerns about building costly
weapons to counter a lessening Soviet threat.
   The legislation sets spending ceilings for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1 totaling $288 billion, or $19 billion less than Bush
sought in his original proposal in January.
   The total is $5.5 billion more than the House approved in
September, a change made to meet the levels set in the budget
resolution adopted by Congress earlier this month.
   The legislation goes on to the Senate, which is expected to pass
the bill. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said he supports the
legislation and presidential approval is likely.
   The money must be provided in separate appropriations.
   Among the major provisions is scaled-down continuation of the
B-2 bomber, the radar-evading aircraft estimated to cost nearly
$865 million a plane and designed to locate targets in the Soviet
Union after a nuclear attack.
   The legislation also calls for $2.9 billion for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, $1.8 billion less than Bush
sought for SDI and $700 million less than Congress approved last
year.
   The military blueprint is the product of weeks of negotiations
between the House and Senate, which approved vastly different
bills.
   The original House legislation stopped production of the B-2
bomber while the Senate adopted the administration's request for
money to buy planes No. 16 and No. 17.
   The compromise provides $4.1 billion for the program, but is
ambiguous on how many bombers the Air Force can purchase. Senate
proponents contend that the service can spend the money as it sees
fit; House opponents believe cost overruns on the first 15 planes
will consume most of the money.
   The confusion and contradictions over the B-2 erupted on the
House floor late Wednesday as Republicans contended that the
Pentagon can buy two new, radar-evading bombers and Democrats
argued it cannot.
   ``The joke is on the Democrats. Mr. Cheney told me he got the
money and he's going to build them. Somebody is being lied to,''
said Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the
House Armed Services Committee.
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Service
panel, threatened that if the Air Force tries to buy two new
planes, ``we will cut off all B-2 money.''
   The bill reduces U.S. troop levels, now about 2.1 million, by
100,000, but, bowing to pressure from the Pentagon, gives the
defense secretary added authority to limit the troop cut to 80,000
if he believes the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf
warrants such a step.
   It significantly scales back spending on land-based, nuclear
missiles and continues the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft the
Pentagon has tried to cancel the past two years as unneeded.
   Final passage did not come without angry complaints from House
Republicans who chastised Aspin for excluding GOP members from
negotiations with the Senate.
   Dickinson was not included in a late-night session in which
Aspin and the ranking members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee reached final agreements on the bill.
   ``Never before has any committee gone into conference and the
ranking member been excluded from the windup session,'' Dickinson
said. ``This is the sleaziest conduct and treatment of any ranking
member I've heard of.''
   Democratic Rep. Marvin Leath of Texas came to Aspin's defense,
saying ``I don't think our chairman intended for this to happen.''

   A fishing crew abandoned their
sinking crab boat in the North Pacific on Wednesday, and at least
two crewmen died in the frigid water, officials said.
   The crew of four took to the life rafts when the 165-foot
crab-fishing boat Pacific Apollo began taking on water, according
to a spokesman at the Rescue Coordination Center of the Canadian
coast guard.
   Three were picked up by the crew of the fishing boat Snow King,
the spokesman said. A search continued for the missing man.
   The boat was believed to be out of Anacortes, Wash., the
spokesman said.
   The Pacific Apollo was about 230 miles southwest of the Queen
Charlotte Islands when it began to take on water, the spokesman
said. It was on its way to the Bering Sea off Alaska to fish for
crab when it got into trouble near the islands, which are off
British Columbia's coast, just south of the southern tip of Alaska.
   An electronic location transmitter helped two ships and a rescue
plane get to the search area.

   Charges against a woman who locked her child
in the family car when she went to work will be reduced because she
has been ``a caring, thoughtful and concerned mother,'' prosecutors
said Wednesday.
   The same day, Chante Fernandez, who lost her secretarial job at
a lumber company when her employer heard of her arrest, learned she
would get her full-time back.
   The store where Ms. Fernandez works park-time on the weekends
also offered her a full-time job on its sales staff, along with
full benefits, counseling and a loan.
   But despite a day of good news, she didn't get her daughter
back. Five-year-old Anjuli, who was found in good condition, was in
the custody of the state Division of Youth and Family Services
pending an investigation.
   Ms. Fernandez told police she locked Anjuli in the car because
she didn't have a suitable baby sitter to watch the child while she
worked weekends. She left a rear seat folded down so the girl could
sleep in the trunk area.
   Ms. Fernandez also told authorities her husband had abandoned
her, her father died in January and her house had been robbed three
times.
   The 24-year-old faced up to five years in prison and a $7,500
fine had she been convicted of criminal restraint charge filed
following her Saturday arrest.
   But widespread public support for the single mother caused
authorities to re-evaulate the case, Middlesex County Prosecutor
Alan Rockoff told a Wednesday news conference. The charge was
reduced to a disorderly persons offense.
   ``In reviewing the case, the woman has on all occasions been a
caring, thoughtful and concerned mother that has used common sense
about her child,'' Rockoff said.
   ``She didn't abandon the child and allow her to drift with the
elements,'' he said. ``She did check on the child, did try to give
her the necessities and try to make her comfortable during the
course of the day. So there were some mitigating circumstances.''
   Rockoff said he was ``not condoning'' the action. ``But I can't
call it child abuse,'' he said.
   Under the reduced charge, Ms. Fernandez can either plead guilty
to a petty disorderly offense, which carries a maximum $500 fine,
or apply for a year-long probation under supervision of the court,
Rockoff said.
   The Associated Press was unable to reach Ms. Fernandez for
comment Wednesday night.

   The budget-conscious city is handing out a
cheaper brand of condom that is too tight, too thin and breaks too
easily, anti-AIDS groups complained Wednesday.
   David Fair, former director of the city's AIDS Activities
Coordinating Office, said he feared the product is being used by
poor people, drug users and others likely to be exposed to AIDS and
sexual diseases.
   ``The city has 600,000 of them on the street, giving them out to
people with higher levels of sexual activity,'' he said. ``It's
exactly the wrong product to give to these people.''
   The condoms in question, named Crown, are made by Okamoto
Industries Inc., in Tokyo. Hisayuki Naito, vice president for
marketing of its American subsidiary, Okamoto U.S.A., in Stratford,
Conn., said he hadn't received any complaints.
   He said the Crown condom is roughly 1 millimeter - four
one-hundredths of an inch - smaller in diameter than the average
brand and ``a little bit thin, but the same strength'' as thicker
brands. He said a Stanford University study rated the condoms good.
   Fair said the city switched from the Prime brand made by
Lifestyle Condom when Lifestyle boosted its price from a nickel to
5{ cents apiece.
   ``We've yanked them,'' said Fran Stoffa, director of the AIDS
Task Force, said of the new condoms. The task force, a private
organization, is one of the groups that distributes the
city-provided condoms.
   ``I was putting two fingers in them and they split,'' Stoffa
said.
   James Hymes, current director of the AIDS Activities
Coordinating Office, said he didn't get any complaints after
checking with 10 AIDS counselors who routinely demonstrate the
toughness of condoms by putting their fist into them.
   ``If there is a problem with this brand, we will recall them
instantly,'' Hymes said. He said he was checking whether the Crown
condoms met specifications issued by the office. Until he hears
conclusively, he recommended that they not be used.
   ``There's a visible difference in the quality,'' Stoffa said.
``They're real thin. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see
that.''
   The specifications were drawn from information in a Consumers
Unon test. The city controller's office said the city recently
bought 625,000 condoms at 5.1 cents apiece.
   The city, through the AIDS Activities Coordinating Office,
bought 2 million condoms last year. This year's budget called for
the purchase of 1 million, with money set aside for individual
agencies to buy a additional million.

   Budget negotiators all but reached final
agreement Wednesday on a long-sought plan to slash the federal
deficit by boosting taxes on the wealthy, raising levies on
gasoline and increasing costs for Medicare recipients.
   The White House said final details remained to be worked out,
but ``sufficient progress has been made'' to allow Bush to sign
another emergency bill to keep the government operating through
Saturday, when lawmakers hope to finish their budget business for
the year.
   The House approved the measure 380-45, the fourth temporary
extension of federal spending this month, and the Senate passed it
by voice vote.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said all federal workers
should report to work as scheduled Thursday. Bush will not actually
sign the stopgap bill until Thursday morning.
   Earlier, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said a budget
compromise might be wrapped up in time to reach the floor for a
vote Thursday. He said Democrats had reached ``a very, very strong
consensus'' to support the package - an important development
because most House Republicans were ready to oppose the plan. But
Bush canceled several campaign stops for Thursday and planned to
spend the day drumming up GOP support for the measure.
   The plan would raise taxes on cigarettes and luxury items and
force spending cuts for a variety of federal programs. But the
Democrats no longer are insisting on imposing a surtax on the rich.
Rather, Foley said, the new plan ``fully supplants the impact of
the surtax.''
   Democratic negotiators expressed confidence they had found a
formula that could end months of negotiations that alternated
between bipartisanship and election-year politics.
   If so, it would pave the way for savings estimated at $500
billion over five years, avert the threat of a partial shutdown of
government services at midnight and signal the final days of the
101st Congress.
   And not a moment too soon. This year's session had run on longer
than in any other election year since World War II.
   Budget issues aside, there was the usual crush of session-ending
developments:
   -The Senate failed by a single vote to override President Bush's
veto of civil rights legislation the dministration claimed would
restore quota systems in private business.
   -Both houses were expected to vote Thursday or Friday on an
overhaul of the nation's clean air laws that would force reductions
in acid rain and automobile pollution.
   -The Senate passed the $11 billion Interior appropriations bill
after embracing a comromise on government financing of allegedly
obscene art. Under the bill, an artist would be barred from further
grants for three years if a court found work financed by the
government to be obscene. The bill goes to a House-Senate
conference committee.
   -The House approved a $15 billion foreign aid bill, reducing aid
to El Salvador and forgiving Egypt's debt. It goes to a
House-Senate conference committee.
   -The House passed an intelligence bill scaling back covert
operations generally. The bill came from a conference committee,
and the Senate must pass the same version.
   -The House passed a defense bill setting spending ceilings
totalling $288 billion; another bill from a conference committee
that the Senate still must approve.
   The budget agreement would clear the way for final approval of a
five-year measure raising taxes on gasoline by about 5 cents a
gallon while boosting levies on cigarettes, alcohol and airline
tickets.
   Projected increases in Medicare spending would be reduced by
about $43 billion, and other cuts would be made in benefit programs
including those for veterans, college students and farmers.
   Officials said the plan derived savings from wage earners with
the heftiest incomes by:
   -Raising the top income-tax rate on the wealthiest Americans
from the current 28 percent to 31 percent.
   -Phasing out the personal exemption, now $2,050 per person, for
the well-to-do while reducing the deductions they can claim by 3
percent.
   The exemption would begin to be phased out for individuals
earning $100,000 and be completely phased out at the $225,000
level. The salary levels would be higher for families. Deductions
would be reduced for people earning more than $100,000 yearly.
   Democrats said they abandoned their demand for a 7.5 percent
surtax on people earning more than $1 million yearly after Bush
made it clear he would never accept that demand.
   ``It appears this is not something the administration will
support,'' said Foley, who said he spoke by telephone with Bush
twice early Wednesday.
   But lawmakers also said there had been a dramatic mood shift and
that after several days of partisan confrontation, it was time for
the budget agreement to be completed and for Congress to adjourn
for the year.
   ``It's one thing to tax the people's pocketbooks and it's
another thing to tax their patience,'' said Rep. Thomas Downey,
D-N.Y. ``We've done too much of both.''
   Budget negotiations began last spring and resulted in a
bipartisan agreement late last month. But that was rejected by the
House for hitting the middle class too hard, and several weeks of
frantic bargaining followed.
   The compromise package bore another political victory for
Democrats: It lacked a cut in the capital gains tax, another Bush
campaign theme.
   Even with the plan, the budget gap for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1 was projected at a record $250 billion. The budget is
expected to total about $1.2 trillion this year.
   The deficit-reduction package would:
   -Raise the 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax to 14 cents.
   -Impose a new 10 percent tax on expensive cars, private planes
and boats, jewelry and furs.
   -Boost the 16-cent-per-pack cigarette tax by 8 cents and
increase levies on alcohol and airline tickets.
   -Increase the earned income tax credit claimed by the poor.
   -Raise the wage ceiling from which the 1.45 percent Medicare
payroll tax is deducted from its current $51,300 to $125,000.
   -Bestow billions in tax breaks for some businesses.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, praised for
easing hostilities between the union movement and Republicans
during her nearly two years in office, is resigning to head the
American Red Cross, officials say.
   Mrs. Dole, the only women to head a department in the Bush
administration, will be the first member of the president's Cabinet
to quit when she makes the announcement, expected today.
   Mrs. Dole, 54, called AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland on Tuesday
afternoon and told him she was stepping down to become president of
the Red Cross, said Ken Young, Kirkland's top aide.

   A jetliner landed outside London today with former British Prime
Minister Edward Heath and the 37 countrymen whose release from Iraq
he had helped secure. Fourteen freed Americans were also headed
home.
   Iraq released the Westerners on Tuesday after what some
interpreted as a peace overture from the Saudi government.
   Also Tuesday, Saddam Hussein's parliament endorsed his proposal
to allow all 330 French citizens in Iraq to leave, a gesture seen
in Paris as an attempt to divide the West's anti-Iraqi alliance.
   The French demanded that Iraq free all foreign hostages.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.N. embargo against Iraq is beginning to
squeeze the Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait, but there is no
evidence of even a partial Iraqi withdrawal from the tiny emirate,
administration and military officials say.
   Pete Williams, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, said Tuesday that Iraq is making ``some adjustments'' to
its military operations in and around Kuwait as a result of the
embargo, which has been in effect since Aug. 6, four days after
Iraq invaded its neighbor.
   Williams said U.S. authorities believe the Iraqi military is
suffering shortages of tires and other materials. He cited Iraq's
recently imposed rationing of civilian supplies of gasoline as an
indication that the whole nation, including its military, is
threatened by the sanctions.
   ``As time goes by, the sanctions continue to have effect. It
becomes harder and harder to support that (military) force as the
embargo restricts the shipment of spare parts and supplies,''
Williams told a news briefing.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Soviets are withdrawing, Koreans and
Filipinos are protesting and costs in Japan are enormous. But the
United States says any reduction of its big troop presence in Asia
will be slow and limited.
   Critics accuse the Defense Department of looking for new threats
now that the Soviet Union has begun major pullouts of troops, ships
and aircraft east of the Ural Mountains.
   Backers of a strong U.S. force say it will prevent any country
from dominating the region and ensure that the world's richest
trade routes remain open.
   In February, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced a 10
percent cut in Asian-based troops over three years, and the latest
round of planned bases closings includes nine small facilities in
South Korea and one in Japan. But Cheney says the bulk of U.S.
forces will stay.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Civil rights leaders and grass-roots groups
lobbied hard as the Senate dug in for a longshot effort to override
President Bush's veto of a major job discrimination bill.
   ``The fundamental rights of millions of working women and
minorities are at stake,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the
chief sponsor, said Tuesday.
   But the White House expressed confidence that lawmakers would
sustain Bush's veto, which he said was necessary because the bill
would lead to hiring quotas - something sponsors dispute.

   TORONTO (AP) - Canadians abhor being seen as following in
American footsteps, and this time they got out in front by
officially tumbling into recession on their own. The United States,
however, may not be far behind.
   Finance Minister Michal Wilson, after weeks of dodging the dread
``R'' word, finally acknowledged to a House of Commons committee
Monday night that Canada had slipped into a recession, though he
expected it to be short.
   The country's largest bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, also
predicted negative growth for the third and fourth quarters of this
year, saying a slow recovery would begin next year.
   Dr. Edward Neufeld, chief economist at the Royal Bank, said the
Canadian economy has never gone into recession when the American
economy did not ``no matter how far back you want to look.''

   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - Memorizing the 258 words of the Future
Farmers of America creed was a high school ritual for generations.
Now the creed is being rewritten to reflect a changing industry,
and not everyone is happy about it.
   ``The new one leaves some of the old standards that we live by
out of it,'' said Joel Janke, North Dakota's FFA adviser, who
learned the creed as a high school student in the early 1950s.
   He is disturbed by the dropping of such passages as, ``I believe
in less dependence on begging and more power in bargaining,'' and
the promise of ``playing square with those whose happiness depends
on me.''
   Janke added: ``They want to get the farm part out of the creed
and out of the terminology. They want to get to the agricultural
standpoint.''

<TEXT>
   Mexico is building seven border bridges
and thousands of miles of highway to handle the boom in traffic
from an expected free-trade agreement with the United States.
   With help from private investors, President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari set a plan in motion last year to improve Mexico's
inadequate roads and customs system.
   Solidarity Bridge and border crossing at Colombia, now a
cinder-block town of only 350 people, is the largest project.
   A 66-mile highway linking Colombia to an improved road between
Laredo, Texas, and Monterrey will cut the driving distance between
the border and Monterrey to 140 miles from 180.
   More than 2,480 miles of highways are to be built before the
president's six-year term ends in 1994. Half will be financed
through private investment.
   The other bridges, under construction or planned, will be in
Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo and Valle Hermosa, all in Tamaulipas state;
Piedras Negras and Ciudad Acuna in Coahuila, and Ciudad Juarez in
Chihuahua state.
   Mexican officials say the improvements are needed to strengthen
trade links with the United States and compete with the economic
blocs of Europe and Asia.
   Trucks crossing into Mexico often must wait for hours, then
negotiate undivided, two-lane highways riddled with potholes.
   ``We don't need to be a rich country to have good roads, but we
need good roads to become a rich country,'' said Carlos Joaquin
Vallejo Rivero. He directs the state highway office in Nuevo Leon,
the northeastern border state where the Colombia project is being
built.
   ``It costs more and takes more time to transport things via bad
roads because of higher insurance and loss of goods,'' he said.
   Trade with the United States took off in 1986 when Mexico joined
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, lowering import duties
on hundreds of foreign products and making exports of Mexican
manufactured goods a priority.
   From less than $30 billion in 1986, two-way trade rose to $52
billion in 1989. Mexico is the third-largest U.S. trading partner,
after Canada and Japan.
   A U.S.-Mexican trade agreement that would remove tariffs and
other barriers is under discussion. It may be linked with the
similar U.S.-Canadian pact of 1988 to create a single North
American trade zone of 335 million people.
   Salinas and President Bush are to discuss the proposal at a
meeting Nov. 26-27 in Monterrey.
   ``All indications are that we are going to have even more
intensive trade with the United States, and we are just not
prepared,'' said Antonio Fuentes Flores, director of the Trust for
the Development of Nuevo Leon.
   Fuentes, whose organization is overseeing construction, said the
820-acre Solidarity site will include an eight-lane bridge, stoage
terminals, refrigerated warehouses and hotel.
   It will more than triple the size of Colombia, a town 10 blocks
square populated mostly by farmers.
   Many people didn't think a new bridge was justified ``because we
already had a crossing at Laredo,'' Fuentes said. Laredo is the
United States' biggest inland port of entry, with 1,600 trucks
crossing daily.
   ``But we looked at projections of how much traffic would
increase in the next few years,'' he said, and ``concluded that we
didn't need to just build a bridge, but we needed to build a new
concept of border crossings.''
   Nuevo Leon was an ideal site, Fuentes said, because more than
half the merchandise moving south through Laredo goes to Monterrey,
the state capital and Mexico's leading industrial city.
   Monterrey businessmen wanted a border crossing in Nuevo Leon so
they would not have to send products through Nuevo Laredo in
Tamaulipas state. They claim customs officials and corrupt unions
in Nuevo Laredo inflate the cost.
   The Mexican side of the bridge and its support facilities is to
cost $49 million, split between the federal government and private
investors.
   Laredo, Texas, is financing the U.S. side, at $62 million, with
help from the state government and Washington. The site is Dolores,
a town 18 miles from Laredo.
   Four new highways in Nuevo Leon, totaling 350 miles, are being
built with $584 million in private funds.
   Vallejo of the state highway office said the concessionaire,
Viaductos de Peaje, would charge tolls for 8 to 14 years before
turning the roads over to the state.
   He said the highways would be divided, with at lin each direction,
speed limits of 75 mph, lights in urban areas,
rest stops aneast two lanes
d the concession company's own roadside mechanics and
patrolmen.

<HEAD>Canadian And American School Kids Track Acid Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Linda bounced into the room with a graduated
cylinder that held a tiny amount of rainwater. Her 23 classmates
whipped out weather charts and began the daily ritual: type of
precipitation, pattern, contaminants.
   It was no mere weather report that occupied the pupils at Pape
Public School in Toronto, but a six-week acid rain monitoring
program involving grade school children in all of Canada and the 16
U.S. border states.
   Its aims are to get accurate readings on acid rain levels over a
wide area of the two countries, while making the young aware of
environmental issues in general and acid rain in particular.
   ``It introduces kids into doing a scientific project like this
and it helps raise some grass-roots awareness in Canada,'' said
Steve Smith, executive director of Public Focus, a non-profit
environmental education organization in Toronto that runs the
Backyard Acid Rain Kit program, called BARK.
   ``Acid rain, specifically, is an issue of considerable concern
to Canadians,'' he said.
   Nadia Miller, who teaches the class at Pape, uses the program to
instill observation in her pupils. In field trips, they examine
trees and buildings that may be suffering the effects of acid rain.
   ``You have to teach the kids to look, to see the world around
them,'' Ms. Miller said.
   BARK also works its way into class discussions on temperate rain
forests and dovetails into the extensive recycling program run
completely by the children at Pape school.
   ``This is all part of environmental awareness,'' Ms. Miller
said.
   The program involves 827 classrooms in Canada and 592 in the
United States, and all the schools are twinned. Most of the
Canadian classes have an American counterpart with which they
exchange results of their observations and other information.
   Linda had just made the daily trip to the roof to fetch the
cylinder, which had collected 1 millimeter of rain. The class
determined what sort of precipitation it was - rain drizzle, hail,
snow - whether it was continuous or intermittent, sky and wind
conditions, the degree of acidity and what contaminants were
present: bird droppings, insects, dirt, leaves.
   For the acidity test, Linda took one of the pH strips provided
in the simple kit by Public Focus and dunked it in the rainwater as
the rest of the class gathered in a circle on the floor. The paper
came up dark olive green, which an accompanying comparison chart
said was 5.5 pH, or little acidity.
   Martin, an intense redhead explained that ``pH is a scale of
measuring acidity and alkalinity; 5.0 to 5.6 is normal rain.''
   A classmate said: ``One day we got a 7.5, but we did it in the
afternoon and the wind was a south wind.''
   What does it all mean?
   ``Maybe on some days industry is less active,'' Martin mused.
   ``Or the wind direction might be different,'' one of the girls
offered.
   The discussion was serious. Ms. Miller urged her pupils to
analyse what they were doing and draw conclusions.
   She said the Pape School class participated in last year's BARK
pilot run, which involved only Ontario and three American states,
and the children would like to continue the work all year.
Data-gathering for BARK ends in November.
   All the information will be fed to BARK headquarters for
processing and tabulation. The results will be computer-mapped and
color-coded by Queen's University in Kingston and each class will
get a copy of the map.
   ``One of the values of the results is that the kids receive the
maps,'' Smith said.
   ``They see they've contributed to something, not just read about
something that others have done. Those kids are far more likely as
adults to feel motivated to take part and do something.''

   Discounts on best-selling books are common in the
United States, but a major British bookseller who offered bargains
on six new titles was taken to court and forced to raise his
prices.
   Terry Maher, chairman of the Pentos group, says he will continue
fighting Britain's price-fixing system for books, but he faces
opposition from competitors, publishers and authors.
   ``The consumer is getting a raw deal,'' Maher said in a
telephone interview. ``We have a fairly narrow, elitist market.
Books re not part of everyday life.''
   His company offered an unprecedented 25 percent off the six
books nominated for the Booker Prize, Britain's most important
literary award.
   Publishers got court injunctions blocking the Pentos discounts
in England, Wales and Scotland, but discounts continue in Ireland.
Maher is fighting the court action in hopes of overturning the Net
Book Agreement, a voluntary accord that allows price fixing.
   Pentos, a fast-growing operation, controls 11 percent of the
British market through 95 stores, including Dillons and Mowbray. It
recently acquired Hatchards, the 193-year-old London bookshop
patronized by Queen Elizabeth II.
   Maher argues that discounts will move books in greater,
profitable numbers and draw customers into shops where they can be
tempted by full-priced books. He points out that book clubs already
are allowed to discount.
   His opponents, including the Publishers Association, Booksellers
Association and Society of Authors, say discounts would start a
price war between Pentos and the huge W.H. Smith chain that would
devastate small bookshops.
   They claim discounts would cut the profit margins publishers use
to produce books that are important, but lose money.
   W.H. Smith has 25 percent of the book market amd supports the
90-year-old Net Book Agreement, which lets a publisher set minimum
prices for its books. The pact has survived 11 years of free-market
reforms by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who forced competition
on lawyers, brewers and utilities.
   No similar restrictions apply in the United States, but
price-support arrangements exist in 10 of the 12 European Community
nations, the Publishers Association said.
   It says prices are lower in Britain than the United States, but
Maher claims they are 50 percent higher.
   ``Possession,'' by Booker Prize winner A.S. Byatt, sells in
Britain for 13.95 pounds ($27.48) and the full price in the United
States is $22.95. When Pentos marked the book down to 10.45 pounds
($20.59), Maher said, sales increased sevenfold.
   Maher has threatened for nearly two years to defy the Net Book
Agreement. He discounted some books last Christmas, but they were
among the 5 percent of British titles are published outside the
voluntary agreement.
   Last year, the Office of Fair Trading decided circumstances had
not changed enough to warrant another review of price-fixing
agreement. The Restrictive Practices Court decided in the 1960s
that abolishing it would result in fewer bookshops, more limited
stocks and higher prices.
   David Shaw, a Conservative member of Parliament, calls the
agreement ``an absolute scandal,'' but could not win support in the
House of Commons for its abolition. Shaw says he will try again.
   Ian Taylor, a director of the Publishers Association, said the
Net Book Agreement ``provides a wide choice of books readily
available to the public at reasonable prices compared with other
developed countries.''
   The average book price in 1987, the most recent year for which
Taylor said figures were available, was 2.85 pounds in Britain and
3.48 pounds in the United States, using an exchange rate of $1.72
to the pound, Taylor said. The current exchange rate is about
$1.97.
   Independent U.S. booksellers have been able to survive in an
unfettered market.
   Major chains account for 40 percent of U.S. bookstore sales,
which are expected to total $7.2 billion this year, the American
Booksellers Association said. The United States has 11,000
bookshops.
   The British association said it does not have comparable
figures, but that two-thirds of Britain's 5,000 to 7,000 stores are
independent. Book sales in Britain last year totaled $4.83 billion,it said.

   The deadline for her term paper was less
than a week away before senior Lynn Flaherty got down to work.
   Instead of loading a backpack with notebooks and pens, she
pulled a chair up to the computer in her dorm room. Instead of
thumbing through a card catalog in the library, she rifled through
reference material without l't like to
hang out in the library, and this means I don't have to.''
   ``My brother goes to Drake and he has to go to an office to use
a word processor. I just chuckle when he talks about waiting in
line for computers.''
   Northwest Missouri is the first - and so far, the only - public
college or university in the United States to put a terminal in
every room and office, then tie them together with a software
system designed for college life.
   ``Without leaving the residence hall, kids can access library
information, and scholarship and job postings,'' said Robert Henry,
a school spokesman. ``They can write and edit papers for classes,
balance their checkbook and find out what's going on around campus.
They can even look up their phone bills and see how much they
owe.''
   The faculty also approves. ``I write tests, record grades, look
up student transcripts and class rolls. Instead of calling the
registrar's office, you can look it up on the computer,'' said
chemistry Professor Harlan Higginbotham.
   If he lost his computer, he said, ``I'd just have to retire. A
secretary wants two days notice to type an exam. But a computer
isn't like that.''
   The system's 2,400 terminals represent a techno invasion at the
campus in the rolling farm country of extreme northwest Missouri.
The electronic campus didn't come cheap, and that is one
explanation why it remains an anomoly.
   The school spent $2.4 million to set up the electronic campus,
and officials have spent $600,000 more since then. The initial cost
to furnish each dorm room with a terminal - now about 1,500 of them
- was about $300 per unit. The university recoups its costs by
charging each student $25 per semester.
   ``Getting campuses computer-oriented is a high priority but it's
a costly item. The shelf lives are not as long as you'd like,''
said Bob Aaron, spokesman for the National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant Colleges. ``And there is a competition
between the two strains, the high-tech user versus the general
user.''
   Still, other schools have taken the plunge. Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh may be ``the most computer-intensive
university in the world,'' said William Arms, vice president for
academic affairs.
   ``Our basic principle is that they pay a lot of money to come to
Carnegie-Mellon and the computers are just like the libraries and
playing fields; they are things that come with the campus,'' Arms
said.
   Students there are not provided with terminals in their rooms.
Most buy their own, so they can hook into the university network,
Arms said.
   At Northwest Missouri, off-campus students must buy their own or
use terminals on campus; more and more courses require their use.
On campus, computers are universal. The 2,800 students living in
the 13 residence halls, need only share terminals with roommates.
   ``Your patience is a lot greater waiting 30 minutes in your own
room, instead of walking across campus to wait in line at some
building,'' said Jon Rickman, director of computer services.
   In many disciplines, ``electronic workbooks'' are available.
Students can call up a program to quiz themselves on things like
chemistry problems.
   ``The program gives them explanations and then asks them some
questions,'' Higginbotham said. ``You get immediate feedback on
what you're doing right or wrong.''
   In the English department, the word processing function has
improved the quality of writing seen by Chairman Jim Saucerman.
   ``It frees them up to write, instead of dealing with the
mechanics of writing,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean perfection
because students who are careless with a pen are careless with a
keyboard. But overall, the finished product is better because they
have more freedom to write.''
   University President Dean Hubbard is proud of his electronic
campus: ``Technology is going to penetrate deeper into our lives.
We need students to be as comfortable with computers as their
parents are with their telephone.''
   There are signs that is happening. Electronic mail is the
system's most popular function; basically a message system,
electronic mail is a way to talk to old friends and meet new ones.
   ``As a freshman, I was really into the e-mail,'' said senior
Stephen King, an art major from Maryville. ``I used to stay on
campus just to use it.''
   With such reliance on an electronic campus, what happens when
the system goes down? No one knows - it's never happened.
   ``We take it down every other month, for about four hours on a
Friday afternoon, for scheduled maintenance,'' Rickman said.
``We've never had it crash on us. We have so many backups that if
one part of the system fails, the others pick up the slack.''

<HEAD>Noted Religious Researcher Leaves Hint of Mainline Turnabout</HEAD>

   Several days before his recent death, noted
religion statistician Constant H. Jacquet Jr. said of the longtime
decline in mainline Protestant membership: ``It's turning.''
   He was ill at home at the time and didn't have at hand
comparative figures to document his point. He suggested waiting
until he got back to his office. But he didn't make it.
   He succumbed to cancer that he thought he had overcome.
   Consequently, his annual compilation of religious data, the 1990
Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches, can be reported this
time only without his further clarifying, analytical comments.
   It shows that the latest U.S. membership figures for churches
and synagogues has increased to 145.4 million from 143.8 million a
year earlier, a gain of about 1.1 percent, or slightly outstripping
the population growth of 1 percent.
   That means active religious affiliation amounted to 58.7 percent
of the American population, a proportion that had inched downward
in recent years, but which this time was up fractionally.
   While the total grew, including the two largest denominations -
the 14.9 million Southern Baptists and 57 million Roman Catholics -
membership in most mainline Protestant bodies continued to slip,
but to a lessening degree.
   That lessening was the basis of the ``turning'' comment by
Jacquet, researcher at the National Council of Churches for 37
years and editor of its annual yearbook, the only comprehensive
summary of American religious data.
   Most mainline Protestant bodies have been losing members since
the late 1960s, amounting to millions of inactives dropped from the
rolls, but the steep losses of the '70s have moderated since the
mid-'80s.
   That leveling trend, furthered in the latest figures, was seen
by Jacquet as presaging a turnabout in the long decline, although
he didn't get a chance to detail the statistical pattern of the
shift.
   Jacquet, 64, had undergone surgery for lung cancer last summer
and had returned to work, seeming to have overcome the problem. But
recently cancer was found to have invaded his spine.
   His death on Oct. 16 stilled a key voice in measuring the status
of American religion for news media, other researchers, reference
books and U.S. government departments.
   Among the denominations still suffering slight losses in his
latest compilation, the decreases this time were around 1 percent,
often less.
   It was only a fraction of that for larger denominations such as
the 9 million United Methodists, 2.4 million Episcopalians, the 5.3
million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and 2.6
million-member Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod.
   However, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) dropped 1.25 percent
to 2.9 million, the American Baptists fell 1.22 percent to 1.5
million and the United Church of Christ decreased 1.07 percent to
1.6 million.
   The latest totals are for 1988, reflecting the regular two-year
time lag in accumulating the combined figures. Several later
reports from individual denominations show further fading of the
prolonged shrinkage.
   Whiled losses persisted for some denominations, others such as
Southern Baptists and Roman Catholics stayed on the upgrade, as did
most smaller evangelical denominations. That resulted in the
overall increase outpacing population growth.
   The overall increase in U.S. religious membership was in
contrast to the total for Canada, whose inclusive membership
dropped about 153,000 to 16.8 million.
   The yearbook also cited other indications of greater religious
activity.
   These included Gallup Poll findings that weekly worship
attendance rose to 43 percent of the population in 1989, up three
percentage points from two years before. It means that about 107.5
million Americans attend worship services each week.
   Teen-age attendance also reached a high mark of 57 percent,
compared to 54 percent three years before.
   Later 1990 Gallup surveys indicate 74 percent of Americans have
made a commitment to Christ, up from 66 percent in 1986.
   However, giving to American churches increased an average of
only 3.5 percent, lagging behind the 4.4 percent inflation rate for
1988, resulting in decreased real income.
   Jacquet, known as ``Connie'' to friends, had been working before
his death at compiling figures for next year's yearbook, but
associates without his long perspective or experience will have to
finish the job.
   ``Over the years, reporters across the continent knew that
Constant Jacquet was their best source for statistical information
about American religion,'' said the Rev. J. Martin Bailey, the
council's communication director.
   ``He carried an enormous amount of historical data in his
head.''

   ``The Common Good,'' examining how communities
work through ethical dilemmas and produced by the National Council
of Churches, is to be broadcast Sunday on ABC-TV.
   The show is the first of four specials in a 1990-91 ``Vision and
Values'' series presented by the Interfaith Broadcasting
Commission.
   In ``The Common Good,'' differing perspectives on right choices
are brought out about community issues in economically depressed
Barbour County, W.Va., and in affluent Westchester County, N.Y.
   Sociologist Robert Bellah of the University of California says
that as a principle, the ``common good'' is urgent these days ``as
we are seeing that if individuals simply seek to maximize their own
welfare, they produce not a common good, but a common bad.''
   The interfaith commission also includes the U.S. Catholic
Conference, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and the
Southern Baptist Radio and Film Commission.
   The second special in the series, ``Winds of Freedom,'' about
changes in Eastern Europe, is scheduled to air Dec. 2.

   CHICAGO (AP) - Dann Herr, the founder of Thomas More Press who
died Sept. 28 at age 73, was described at his funeral as a major
influence in 20th century Roman Catholic thought.
   ``His discovery of new writers and encouragement of established
ones may have made him the most important man in Catholic
publishing,'' said Andrew Greeley, a priest who is an author and
sociologist.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Messianic Jews are urging Israel to amend its
Law of Return to include Jews who believe in Jesus in its grant of
automatic citizenship to all Jews.
   The International Union of Messianic Jewish Congregations sent
letters to Israeli officials calling for such a change following a
recent Israel Supreme Court decision rejecting immigration
applications of two Messianic Jews.
   Such an exclusion poses a potential threat to approximately
100,000 Jews worldwide who believe that Jesus, called Yeshua, is
the Jewish Messiah.
   Excluding Messianic Jews could lead to barring of
``Reconstructionist, Reform, atheist or any other Jew whose
thoughts do not conform to that of the powerful religious
parties,'' wrote Elliot Klayman of the Messianic Jewish group.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A Roman Catholic leader says the new Soviet
law on religious freedom will allow American Catholics to assist
their ``brother and sister Catholics to rebuild their church.''
   Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, chairman of the U.S.
Catholic Conference's international policy committee, said the new
law ``is a critical step in the process of providing the
institutional guarantees of full religious freedom in all its many
dimensions.''

<HEAD>Talking Taxes: There's Always a Fight About What's Fair</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Jimmy Carter used to call the income
tax system a disgrace to the human race. Republican Ronald Reagan
said it was so complex, frustrating and unfair as to be
un-American.
   Then the system was overhauled, and when Reagan signed a tax
reform bill the Democrats helped fashion, he said equity and
certainty had been restored.
   Not for long.
   Four years later, the fairness issue is back, sharply drawn by
Democratic insistence that the rich haven't been paying their
share. The sole surviving certainty about the reformed tax system
is that there will be more pressure for changes, meaning increases,
next time the government faces a budget crisis.
   That next time is almost inevitable, and in fewer than the five
years the 1990 deficit deal was designed to cover. The $500 billion
in deficit reduction it is supposed to produce is based on economic
forecasts so optimistic as to be almost euphoric.
   That includes a forecast of sharply declining interest rates,
especially after 1991. Economic growth would have to surge over the
same period to meet its revenue estimates, and inflation would have
to decrease steadily.
   Budget negotiators insisted the numbers are not phoney, even
though they may not prove correct. By now, that's the pattern.
Deficit forecasts have been far from results during the past five
years. Those estimates were computed one year at a time, not five,
and the major reason they missed was that economic estimates were
overly optimistic.
   Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, the majority leader, said
nobody could look people in the eye and claim to know what's going
to happen over the five-year span. Nor, he said, could there be any
guarantee that the government won't have to address the same
problem again.
   Safer to guarantee that it will be back for another round over
taxes, spending and the federal deficit. The economy is slumping,
not surging. In the best of circumstances, the projected five-year
plan would only reduce the rate of increase in the national debt,
not the debt itself.
   Explaining his grudging agreement to accept tax increases, Bush
said Tuesday that Reagan had to compromise, too, because he also
had to deal with Democrats in Congress.
   ``...President Reagan found, same thing, 1982, go back and look
at the record, the rhetoric was about the same,'' Bush said during
a campaign stop in Manchester, N.H. ``That in spite of his aversion
to taxes, the only way to govern was to accept a compromise.
   ``But Reagan swallowed hard and the economy moved, and interest
rates came down ... when he did what he had to do,'' Bush said.
   His own administration had struggled to avoid compromising on
tax rates, trying to hold one of the lines Reagan left, a
28-percent top bracket, set in the 1986 tax reform law. Instead of
raising the rate, Republicans wanted to restrict deductions, a
disguised, and more complex way of imposing more taxes.
   Both a higher rate and deduction limits on the wealthy wound up
on the table.
   Governors in both parties complained about restrictions on
federal income tax deductions, saying that would restrict their
ability to raise state revenues, and would set a precedent that
could lead ultimately to eliminating the deductibility of state and
local taxes.
   Senators and House members from states that levy high income
taxes said the impact would be uneven and unfair. The
counter-argument: Congress took away the deduction for state and
local sales taxes in the 1986 law, and that had a disproportionate
impact on states that rely most heavily on sales taxes instead of
income taxes.
   That's the way one season's reforms become fodder for the next
season's tax debate. Fairness is always in the eye of the political
beholder. The tax code and tax rates will be at issue as long as
there are politicians to talk about them and Congresses to change
them.
   Before this round, the top tax rate had been changed 10 times in
30 years.

   Rep. John Conyers was a fiery rebel who
disdained the establishment for much of his first quarter-century
in Congress. Now he's joining the other side.
   ``I get some kidding about the fact that now I'm one of the
institutional leaders that I used to criticize so much,'' he said
in a recent interview. ``But my goals haven't changed that much.''
   The black Democrat from Detroit is completing his second year as
chairman of the House Government Operations Committee.
   It might seem a confining assignment for a civil-rights champion
who stood with Martin Luther King Jr., slept on sidewalks with the
homeless and raised the possibility of impeaching President Reagan
over the Iran-contra affair.
   But Conyers, 61, insists he will not abandon the causes he has
supported since his activist days in the 1960s.
   Rather, he can pursue his social agenda as an insider,
substituting deal-making and quiet persuasion for the searing
rhetoric of old.
   The son of an auto worker and union organizer, Conyers was
interested in politics and civil rights from his youth. He chose
law school over his other passion - jazz - after his father
insisted he not become a musician.
   ``He thought that was unthinkable ... wasn't steady work and
wasn't responsible work as far as he was concerned,'' Conyers said.
``I had a dickens of a time working out an arrangement to buy a
trumpet because he thought that would start me out on the wrong
way.''
   But Conyers remains a big jazz fan. He's even sponsoring
legislation to forgive the $1.6 million tax debt of band leader
Woody Herman's estate. Conyers says an unscrupulous business
manager gambled away Herman's money and didn't file his taxes for
six years, leaving Herman penniless before his 1987 death.
   Unpredictability and a fierce desire for personal privacy are
other Conyers traits.
   He ended his lifelong bachelorhood in June, marrying 25-year-old
Monica Ann Esters without telling his closest friends, political
associates - or even his brother.
   ``I've never gotten into his personal or social life,'' said
Eugene Gilmer of Detroit, a friend since 1942. ``It's just always
been hands off.''
   Conyers is continuing to evolve into a congressional insider a
year after what some considered a potentially fatal blunder: his
1989 bid to unseat veteran Detroit Mayor Coleman Young. His
error-plagued, poorly organized campaign flopped and he finished
third in the Democratic primary.
   He was a charismatic figure on the campaign trail, dapper in
suspenders and colorful handkerchiefs. But he often showed up late
for appointments or missed them altogether. On one occasion, aides
tried to rush him to an engagement but he insisted on stopping at a
restaurant for soul food.
   After that defeat, Democrats spoke openly of challenging
Conyers's re-election to the House. Instead, he was renominated for
his House seat without opposition and is a heavy favorite to defeat
Republican Raymond H. Shoulders in the general election.
   ``You don't really lose any clout here (in Congress) if you run
for another office and don't win,'' Conyers said. ``There are lots
of guys walking around that tried to run for governor or mayor.''
   Conyers became chairman of the Government Operations Committee -
which has jurisdiction over nearly all government programs and
agencies - when Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, moved to the Judiciary
Committee helm in early 1989.
   Since then, Conyers has conducted hearings and introduced
legislation on topics as diverse as the drug war, environmental
protection, the military budget and privacy of genetic information.
   He sponsored legislation, which became law this year, requiring
the FBI to compile statistics on crimes motivated by bigotry.
Another Conyers bill that would register people to vote when they
obtain a driver's license has cleared the House.
   Conyers also is using the committee as a platform to air blacks'
grievances against the government. He prodded the FBI to
investigate charges that black agents were being harassed.
   And he has promised an investigation of complaints that black
officeholders are being singled out for criminal investigations -
the subject of a shouting match earlier this year between Conyers
and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   ``All-out sleazy tactics are being used to entrap black
officials by any means that can be imagined,'' Conyers complained
at a committee hearing.
   ``I trust our judicial system'' to treat people fairly,
Thornburgh said.
   ``I used to believe that,'' Conyers retorted. ``I don't believe
that any more.''

<HEAD>Coming Soon to Your Grocer's Shelves - Your Local Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along with a special on tuna on Aisle 7 and
a sale on cat food on Aisle 4, don't be surprised if your local
supermarket features a nice deal on checking accounts.
   Supermarket banking, something of a novelty when it first
appeared in the 1970s, has been rapidly gaining popularity over the
last five years.
   With banks under the gun to cut costs in a rocky economy, there
may be a lot more of them soon. It's much cheaper for a bank to set
up a branch at a grocery counter than to operate in a tradional
brick and mortar bank building.
   And they're apparently popular with customers.
   There are currently 847 supermarket bank branches nationwide,
with most of them in the Southeast and Southwest, said John W.
Garnett, executive vice president of Norcross, Ga.-based
International Banking Technologies, a consulting firm that helps
banks open and operate these facilities.
   Garnett admits that at first blush, it looks mighty strange to
see a banker holding court amid the produce and frozen pizza.
   ``People are accustomed to seeing a 400,000-square-foot
branch,'' he said. ``When you walk into a supermarket and see a
400-square-foot branch - there is a perception you have to
overcome.
   ``We explain (to customers) that it's backed up by the FDIC
(Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.), that the bank is sound. Then
it's not a problem.''
   The grocery branches are full-service operations that can do
virtually anything a traditional bank location can do. However,
they usually stay open into the evening and also do business on
Sundays, Garnett said.
   Garnett's company entered the supermarket bank business in 1983,
and now has 350 branches across the country. IBT had $20 million in
revenue last year, he said.
   Garnett said the unconventional operations provide a great
opportunity to attract new customers.
   ``In a traditional bank . . . 95 percent of your walk-ins are
already customers or coming in for a specific reason,'' he said.
``Ninety-five percent in the supermarket are not your customers -
they're not coming in for banking, they're coming in to shop.''
   So employees at the grocery branches have to be aggressive
marketers. These bankers walk the aisles and solicit business,
Garnett said.
   The chief attraction for the bank business, Garnett said, is
cost-cutting. Where it costs an average of $1 million up front to
open a traditonal style bank, it takes only $200,000 to open a
grocery branch, he said.
   Ongoing costs vary from location to location, said Garnett,
whose exhibit drew a respectable crowd this week at the American
Bankers Association convention. He declined to give an average of
monthly operating costs.
   In the Atlanta area, Bank South has branches in 36 Kroger
stores, Garnett said. IBT recently signed a deal with Pittsburgh's
Mellon Bank to open 21 locations, he added.
   ``Not everybody's crazy about supermarket banks but some are,''
said Dallas banking consultant Don Wright. ``They seem to work
quite well if you put them in the right location.''
   Garnett said IBT's clients include banks as well as savings and
loans, though S&amp;L interest has stalled since the thrift industry
has come under seige.
   In the last two years, additions to the grocery list have been
almost exclusively commercial banks, Garnett said. About 64 percent
of all supermarket facilities are banks, he said.

   Turn to page 225 of the 13th edition of ``The
Fannie Farmer Cookbook'' to learn how to truss a chicken, page 628
to bake a batch of brownies. Or just soak in the spirit of the
book, which is only partly about food.
   It also is about ``an act of giving and receiving, because the
experience at table is a communal sharing; talk begins to flow,
feelings are expressed, and a sense of well-being takes over,''
Marion Cunningham writes in the 13th edition of Fannie Merritt
Farmer's guide to the American kitchen.
   A valuable cookbook also reflects its time, and the previous
edition - Cunningham's first, published 11 years ago - already was
losing its relevancy when she set out three years ago on the new
edition.
   ``I tell you, things are different, really different. It was
only looking recipe by recipe that I could see how dramatic our
changes have been,'' she said in an interview in New York.
   Testing every recipe in the 12th edition, Cunningham dropped 200
and added 325, for an appropriate total of 1,990. Fat was reduced
when it worked, and recipes sometimes dropped when it didn't.
There's no kipered herring in cream or crabmeat terrapin, for
example.
   There are new chapters on microwave cooking (which surely won't
prompt any manufacturers to ask her to be a spokeswoman), outdoor
cooking and vegetarian foods, such as zucchini pancakes and a
winter vegetable cobbler that ``will win any contest.''
   All sorts of ethnic ingredients are used. Raw fish is out, as is
steak tartare. Salt generally is left up to the cook. And there are
warnings about raw eggs and fish and other safety problems.
   ``Those were the issues that were very hard to reconcile,''
Cunningham said. ``To act responsibly and not destroy the feeling
that cooking and eating are ... well, certainly one of the better
human endeavors.''
   While Farmer aimed ``The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book,''
published in 1896, at families who had help in the kitchen, the
newest edition of ``The Fannie Farmer Cookbook'' (Alfred A. Knopf,
$24.95) is intended to capture the way ordinary people actually
eat.
   So along with the instructions for making pasta from scratch are
recipes for a ham and cheese sandwich, for making popcorn, hotdogs
and macaroni and cheese. Cunningham tells how to improve the flavor
of canned broths, and offers suggestions for leftovers. ``Everyone
clamors'' for the simple cheese spread in the appetizer chapter,
she writes.
   There is plenty of practical advice, too. Of olive oils, for
example, she says, ``Money does not always buy the best, and I have
found the terms `virgin' and `extra virgin' not very meaningful.''
   Both inside covers have all sorts of nifty facts - things you've
been told dozens of times but can't seem to keep straight, such as
how to tell if an egg is stale and whether cream whips better cold
or at room temperature.
   Farmer would, Cunningham concluded, wholeheartedly embrace
today's health movement. Cunningham, too, thinks we ought to know
what we eat.
   ``But in concentrating so much on the negative aspects of
eating, we are making ourselves overly fearful and we are missing
the pleasure that a good meal provides,'' she writes. ``Instead of
stringent diets, eliminating almost all fats, all salt, all sugar
from our diets, and bloating ourselves with high-fiber products, I
believe that the best possible approach for the average person is
to eat a wide variety of foods and to eat sensibly, in
moderation.''
   While there is plenty of low-fat food, this is no diet book.
   Along with the turkey patties and vegetable soups and green
salads, there is a ``carpetbag steak,'' a beef and oyster dish from
the ``improvident days'' of the 19th century, and chicken fried
steak served with milk gravy.
   Cunningham delivers a storehouse of basic information - and a
pep talk. Come on, now, just get up and go in the kitchen. Taste
the food, experiment. It's fun, it's homey and it tastes good.
Don't let your failures stop you.
   ``Cooking is a dandy way to solve a lot of problems,'' said
Cunningham. Besides, she said, ``It's harder to learn to drive a
car.''
   Cunningham, 68, began the 12th edition of Fannie Farmer in 1974,
with no writing experience and no famous name. She had been a
full-time homemaker, and two years earlier had met the late
American cooking icon James Beard.
   ``Jim Beard recommended me. I didn't think I had any
qualifications,'' said Cunningham, sitting on a hotel bed with her
legs drawn up under her, gray hair pulled straight back into a
short, neat ponytail.
   The choice made sense to Judith Jones, Cunningham's editor at
Knopf.
   ``For one thing, she had worked with Beard and his classes on
the West Coast. He thought she really typified the good home cook
in America and had natural good taste, and that's just what Fannie
Farmer needed,'' Jones said.
   Cunningham was charged with ``restoring the old-fashioned
principles.''
   ``It made me so happy to have something to focus on. I've really
loved it,'' she said. ``I loved it from the beginning.''
   Her pale blue eyes still express a little awe at her success
more than a decade later, during which she also has written ``The
Fannie Farmer Baking Book'' and ``The Breakfast Book'' and worked
as a restaurant consultant.
   Her husband, a man she'd known since kindergarten and who she
says gave her the support and encouragement to become a
professional, died three years ago. Their son and daughter are
grown. So except for a yellow labrador named Rover and a cat, she
lives alone and cooks for herself in Walnut Creek, Calif.
   Besides Beard, she uses ``Joy of Cooking'' and the early
American cookbooks she collects: ``I turn to a lot of them,
wonderful recipes, simple to make.''
   Like three-quarters of American families, she has a microwave.
The ``speedy, clean and silent'' oven did not fare well under
Cunningham's scrutiny, although she includes more than 50 recipes
specifically for it.
   ``The microwave has promised a lot more than it can deliver,''
she said.
   It was, she wrote, no faster than the stove for many of the
vegetables she tested. Meat becomes ``pallid and the texture is not
appealing.''
   While Cunningham experimented with the new in equipment and
ingredients, sometimes she found the old to be far superior.
   Lobster thermidor and newburg, for example, did not work with
milk instead of cream, and with cream they stayed.
   ``People can read about them if they don't want to make them,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   Convinced it's now warranted, the Rev. William R. Farmer is both
a United Methodist and a Roman Catholic. The combination contrasts
with the separate institutional postures, but he says there is firm
basis for it.
   His rare, joint allegiance puts into effect for an individual
the ecumenical movement's unifying goal for the churches. They
haven't yet made it formally, but he says the way has opened for it
on essentials.
   Consequently, he said, he acted to ``live a reality that is
here, but that still is hidden to most people'' - even though
Protestant-Catholic dialogue teams have found sufficient mutuality
for it.
   ``You have to act proleptically, to see something coming, and
act now as if that which is coming is already here,'' he said in an
interview. ``It's apparently not going to happen in my lifetime.
   ``So I've taken steps to actualize it in my own life in a
practical way. It works for me. I don't see any need to wait for
official bodies 100 years from now to iron out some of these minor
things.''
   Farmer, 69, a longtime New Testament professor at Southern
Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology, joined Holy
Cross Roman Catholic Church in Dallas last Jan. 25, but he also
kept his Methodist affiliation.
   His unusual step has raised some canonical questions in both
denominations that still are to be clarified. He said he has had a
``lot of reaction, the gist of almost all of it positive.''
   ``I don't regard it as a conversion, or that I've put away my
Methodist heritage at all,'' he said, noting that he continues his
Methodist university post and serves as an assistant pastor at St.
Luke's Community Methodist Church in Dallas.
   At the same time, Farmer said, at the Catholic Holy Cross parish
led by a longtime friend, the Rev. Timothy Gollop, he was seen as
``bringing into that church a very rich Methodist heritage.''
   ``I'm trying to be fully in both congregations in a single
ministry, and in the whole church, recognizing its oneness, above
all in matters of race,'' Farmer said.
   Both he and Gollop are white. The two congregations on Dallas'
south side are made up largely of blacks and Hispanics. Farmer said
that ``the new age of ecumenism'' is taking place in concepts of
God's ``option for the poor.''
   ``It's grass roots ecumenism,'' he said. ``It's happening all
over the world, in homes, in churches. Officials don't know what to
do with it. Accordingly, there are no provisions for it and no
restrictions against it.
   ``It's best not to cause scandal, but go ahead and do it, being
sure you're doing it in good conscience and doing it in obedience
to the Gospel.''
   Temporarily, Farmer is on leave as resident theologian at the
Methodist Mission Resource Center at Emory University in Atlanta
and as a research scholar at Columbia Presbyterian Seminary there.
   He said that when he returns to his teaching post and ministry
in Dallas in January, it will be up to the Roman Catholic and
United Methodist bishops there to adjudicate his special status.
   ``They're studying it,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean we're out of
the woods. I don't know what the outcome will be. A lot of good
friends in both churches have been very encouraging. It remains to
be seen what the bishops will do.''
   Farmer said Catholic dialogue teams with Methodists, Lutherans
and Episcopalians have found concurrence on most major issues,
including a modified papacy, with the pope as presiding officer
over a representtive council.
   He said basic accord also has been found on Christ's ``real
presence'' in Holy Communion. ``Basicially, Roman Catholic
understanding of it is very close to that of (Methodist founder)
John Wesley,'' Farmer said.
   ``There still are differences and some are important, but
they're not great enough to justify our not being able to share the
Lord's Supper,'' he added. ``It's a scandal that we're divided at
the Lord's table.
   ``We ought to be ashamed at the excuses we use. It must be very
painful to Christ.''
   Farmer said that as assistant pastor at St. Luke's, he does not
preside in celebrating Holy Communion, but receives it both there
and in the Catholic church. Catholic rules generally bar Protestant
reception in Catholic services.
   With his dual membership surmounting that barrier personally,
Farmer said the churches ``should find some way of taking communion
together on an officially approved basis.''
   Most rank-and-file church people, both Protestants and
Catholics, ``still are living with stereotypes of the past,'' in
which the two Christian branches are seen as contradictory, he
said.
   ``But when you get together, and look at the living Gospel, you
find those contradictions disappear,'' he said. ``You find out that
essentially they are the same faith.''

<HEAD>Netherlands Becoming Less of a Haven for Refugees</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIJSBERGEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Netherlands is tightening the
rules on asylum because it hasn't enough money, housing and jobs
for all the poor refugees flooding in.
   Holland is a historic haven for the oppressed. It sheltered the
Pilgrims, who fled religious persecution in England, before they
sailed for the New World.
   A decade ago, in 1980, only 1,330 people claimed refugee status
in the Netherlands. This year, the number is expected to reach
20,000 and the government threatens to jail aliens who make
unjustified requests for asylum.
   Dutch officials contend most asylum seekers are economic
refugees looking for easier lives in this high-tech welfare state.
   Hundreds of people have come from economically depressed Eastern
Europe in recent months, and the government fears a new rush of
arrivals if the Persian Gulf crisis turns into war.
   The Netherlands subscribes to the U.N. definition of political
refugees as those fleeing persecution on ideological grounds, and
is reluctant to stretch its welfare resources in a time of economic
uncertainty.
   Jobs, housing and tolerance are getting scarce, and only about
13 percent of asylum requests are approved.
   ``This is one of the most densely populated countries in the
world,'' said Maurice van Hezik, spokesman for the Justice
Ministry. ``There's pretty high unemployment among the non-Dutch
population. If you were to admit people who only come to work, that
would make the problem worse.''
   One asylum seeker, Sara Amini of Iran, claims she was persecuted
at home for being a member of a small opposition party in Iran.
   When she arrived last summer with her husband and two children,
she expected the free housing and allowances that used to be given
nearly all asylum seekers.
   Instead, they were jammed into a 15-foot-square room at a former
convent school in Rijsbergen, one of 23 refugee camps in Holland.
   ``I heard people in the Netherlands were very friendly, very
helpful compared to other European people,'' She said in an
interview. ``I didn't expect it to be like this.''
   People seeking asylum in the Netherlands used to be taken to
government-subsidized housing projects and given social welfare
payments equivalent to about $800 a month.
   In 1987, however, an influx of ethnic Tamils fleeing the civil
war in Sri Lanka gave rise to what critics call the ``bed, bath and
bread'' program.
   The government opened 15 refugee camps, including Rijsbergen, to
house asylum seekers during processing.
   Aad Kosto, deputy justice minister, said this summer he would
jail those who sought asylum without good reason and might flee the
camps and try to lose themselves in the population.
   Only a few people have been jailed, but the practice is expected
to become more common in the effort to stop rejected asylum seekers
from joining the estimated 50,000 to 60,000 illegal aliens in this
nation of 14.6 million.
   Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers summoned the mayors of eight towns
and villages in September and told them each would be host to a new
refugee camp. He said the first busloads of people were on their
way.
   Seven more camps are planned by the Welfare Ministry, which is
buying 500 mobile homes.
   Van Hezik said some people admit they've only come for jobs, and
others offer ``the strangest stories.''
   He cited the case of a Third World refugee who claimed to have
arrived on a ship bound for Switzerland, which is landlocked. Van
Hezik said the man apparently hoped to be expelled to that country.
   In early August, Romanians began pouring into Eindhoven in
southern Holland. Radio Free Europe, the U.S.-sponsored station,
had described the city as hospitable to strangers, van Hezik said.
   Hundreds of East Europeans have made their way to the
Netherlands and the Persian Gulf may provide the next source of
refugees, said Jan Tielemans, director of the Rijsbergen camp.
   ``We'll probably be noticing the side effects . . . the Indians,
the Sri Lankans who are huddling in Jordan, Eygptians too,'' he
said. ``We won't know for another few months.
   ``Some of these people are simply looking for a living, and they
think one of the ways they'll get it is by asking for asylum.''
   A 26-year-old Iraqi at Rijsbergen said he deserted Saddam
Hussein's army days before it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``I was sick and tired of it all,'' said the man, who identified
himself as an artillery sergeant born in Yemen but would not give
his name. ``I just wondered what would happen if I deserted.''
   He said he hid in a helicopter belonging to the Red Crescent,
the Moslem version of the Red Cross, which took him from his
position near Basra in the south to the Kurdistan region of
northwestern Iraq, then crossed into Turkey.
   The Iraqi said he reached Amsterdam by ship, and acknowledged he
stood ``very little chance'' of being accepted as a refugee.
   ``If they're willing to listen, I'll tell my story,'' he said.
``If not, the world is big enough.''

<HEAD>Hard Fight for Polish Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a tough campaign for president,
barbed with Polish humor, between the earthy shipyard worker who
founded Solidarity and the somber, laconic intellectual he chose as
prime minister.
   What do Poles think of the contest between Lech Walesa and Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in their first popular vote for the
presidency?
   Some call it Cham vs. Hamlet. Cham, pronounced ``ham,'' is
Polish for bumpkin.
   Others have asked: Will Mazowiecki declare his candidacy before
or after the election?
   Then there's the story of a problem Walesa had when he wanted to
reserve a burial site in Jerusalem next to Jesus Christ.
   He found the cost was $150,000, it goes, and said to his top
aide: ``I don't know, Krzysiek. Is it worth it for only three
days?''
   The duel between Eastern Europe's first non-Communist head of
government and the man who gave him the job has rekindled interest
in politics after months of hand-wringing by commentators over
post-Communist apathy.
   Nearly all conversations turn sooner or later to the question of
which one will occupy Belweder Palace, seat of Polish presidents.
   A man was even killed in a drunken dispute with his son-in-law
over who would be the better president, the state news agency
reported.
   Poland held parliamentary elections in June 1989 that were
largely free and democratic local elections in May, but this is the
first real contest because Solidarity candidates swept the earlier
votes.
   Surveys indicate the two former Solidarity allies are running
about even.
   Other candidates have ventured into the ring, including Roman
Bartoszcze of the Peasant Party and Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz of the
Social Democrats, formerly the Communists, but only Walesa and
Mazowiecki are given a real chance.
   If neither gets 50 percent of the votes Nov. 25, a runoff will
be held Dec. 9.
   Part of the fascination stems from their contrasting styles.
   Walesa is electric, speaking rapidly, seeming to bob and weave
through questions thrown at him from the crowd.
   Mazowiecki is ``grey on grey'' in the words of one newspaper,
shy and ponderous in speech but exuding character and moral
authority.
   Walesa declared early and began an aggressive campaign
immediately with meetings at factories, where he is strong, and
with academics, Mazowiecki's turf.
   In the first three weeks of October, Walesa visited nine cities,
saw more than 100,000 people and was seen by millions more on
television. Local Solidarity chapters organize his Western-style
rallies, held outdoors or in large arenas with banners, brass bands
and deafening loudspeakers.
   Mazowiecki made his first campaign appearance Oct. 14, two weeks
after Walesa, in the Krakow Philharmonic Hall, which seats only 800
people. Instead of direct questions from the crowd, he took written
ones that were rephrased by his campaign spokesman.
   The prime minister seems hesitant about contact with strangers.
Hundreds of people waited outside the hall in Krakow for two hours
and Mazowiecki rewarded them with only a few minutes on the
balcony, his stilted words of thanks barely audible through a
bullhorn.
   His dedication to his job, evident in his tired, careworn
appearance, earns sympathy even from people who say they will vote
for Walesa.
   After becoming prime minister in August 1989, Mazowiecki set a
considered, pragmatic course that won respect abroad and gave Poles
a sense of security against the sudden shocks of revolutionary
change.
   To many, however, Mazowiecki's government has seemed to drag its
feet, allowing former secret police to destroy records and keeping
Communist ministers in the government half a year after the party
dissolved.
   In his campaign, Walesa advocates faster change and has been
quoted as intending to use a ``sharp axe'' to chop away vestiges of
the old system.
   He and Mazowiecki also appear to disagree about policy toward
the Communist leadership. When he took office, the prime minister
spoke of drawing a line between present and past, but Walesa has
said he wants to ``settle accounts'' with those who have injured
Poland or stolen from it.
   If Walesa becomes president, Mazowiecki says, he will join the
opposition. Walesa replies that he already has five other
candidates for prime minister.
   Critics accuse Walesa of currying favor with the mob, promising
easy solutions he cannot deliver and becoming a demagogue who could
abuse the still-fragile democracy and frighten off Western
investors.
   ``I'll vote for Mazowiecki because, under his presidency, I can
sleep peacefully,'' Adam Michnik, a former Walesa adviser, told a
rally. ``If someone knocks at my door at 5 in the morning, it can
only be the milkman.''
   ``Walesa is as suitable to be president as I am to be a radio
announcer,'' Michnik, now editor of Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's
leading daily newspaper, said in a recent broadcast.
   Michnik spoke with his usual stutter.
   Walesa wished him luck in radio.

   Marvin Leath came to Congress from the heart
of Texas with a country musician's soul and a banker's sense.
   But after a dozen years in the House, Leath is calling it quits
- frustrated by the ability of an individual congressman to make a
difference.
   ``You see so much written in the media and so forth about
people, incumbents, who get these jobs and they never leave and
they're an institution,'' said the Waco Democrat.
   ``...People say nobody walks away from that job. Well somebody
did,'' he said. ``And maybe that gives a little bit of faith to
people who think the system is so totally corrupt and bad. It
really isn't.''
   In the early 1980s, Leath was a part of the group of
conservative Democrats called the ``Boll Weevils'' that supported a
stronger defense and tax reform.
   But he said defense spending ran amuck under President Reagan
and the deficit's growth from $40 billion to more than $300 billion
``deeply distresses'' him.
   ``Most of the things I hoped to do ... the big issues, we did
something about but we did in excess,'' Leath said.
   ``I really thought the 80s was going to be the decade that was
the most critical in the country's history,'' he said. ``Perhaps it
was. But I think if you look back on that, I have to think that as
a government, we blew it.''
   Reagan didn't exert the leadership to make hard choices, Leath
said, noting the government wasn't designed for Congress to make
laws alone. The hundreds of interests reflected by Congress also
frustrate its power, he said.
   ``You can't expect (Congress) to develop national policy,''
Leath said. ``You've got to have a strong president, willing to
take the political risks to solve the problems. Bush is much more
prone to do that than Reagan.''
   Leath, who made his fortune as a banker in Marlin and Waco, is
known as a pretty fair country music crooner and host of a popular
annual barbecue.
   ``You don't see a whole lot of those kinds of parties around
here,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, who was elected in
1978 from a neighboring district and was also a ``Boll Weevil.''
   ``This guy has star potential,'' Congressional scholar Norm
Ornstein said of Leath's singing.
   Leath's friend Willie Nelson has encouraged him to cut an album.
But, Leath said, ``I'm a little bit old to go on the country music
circuit.'' At 59, Leath is only two years older than Nelson.
   In Congress, Leath closely followed the problems of the budget
and financial industry from a seat on the House Budget Committee.
   He voted against thrift deregulation in 1980 and argued that
crisis in thrifts, banks and insurance companies was caused by
lawmakers' ``foolish mistakes.''
   ``Those of us who understood what the banking system was,
understood why we had some of the rules we had for 50 years. We
felt very reasonably assured when you destroyed those things that
were necessary foundations, this would happen,'' Leath said. ``But
you couldn't get anybody to listen to you.''
   Leath will take about $484,000 in leftover campaign funds with
him when he leaves. He'll keep some for himself to repay expenses
from that first campaign, he said. The rest will go to charity and
political candidates. ``I think that gives me a good way to stay
involved in the system,'' Leath said.
   He worried some about leaving constituents in the lurch,
particularly while fighting the Army's decision to deactivate one
of two armored divisions at Fort Hood in his district.
   ``You can always say, `I've just got to do another term.' First
thing you know, you're a doddering old man,'' Leath said.

<HEAD>Teaching Dealers a New Way To Sell Used Cars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jim DeVoe's down-home, deep voice and pot
belly exude friendliness. He's also pretty smart, with an MBA under
his belt. And he's good with numbers, having worked in commercial
loans for a big Chicago bank.
   The question is: Would you buy a used car from this man?
   So many people have that used-car dealer DeVoe is now selling
his sales techniques to others.
   Every month, dozens of dealers nationwide travel to this General
Motors Corp. factory town to hear the successful 46-year-old native
Hoosier explain how they can make money selling used cars to
customers with bad credit.
   The three-day course outlines DeVoe's ``buy here-pay here''
philosophy, a trade practice by which dealers provide the financing
for customers the banks have turned away.
   ``The car dealers today are having plenty of trouble, and they
need extra help,'' said DeVoe, who owns a Chevrolet-Cadillac
dealership.
   Domestic car sales were off around 5 percent through early
October over the previous year. The prospect of a recession,
declining consumer confidence and high gasoline prices make it
unlikely sales will rebound any time soon.
   They are conditions that make buy here-pay here all the more
attractive, DeVoe said.
   He said as many as half of all car customers have some flaw in
their credit profile that gets them rejected by banks - perhaps
they've missed a loan payment or spent too little time in a
community or on a job.
   Dealerships can set up their own lending operations that can
finance a car purchase by these customers without as great a risk
as a bank faces, DeVoe said.
   He gives this example involving a car selling for $2,800: After
taxes and a $300 downpayment, a $2,500 loan may be needed. If the
borrower doesn't pay, the bank may get as little as $300 when the
recovered car is resold and be stuck with a $2,200 loss.
   Using that same example: A dealer, who may have paid only $1,000
for the car to begin with, has only a $700 risk after taxes and
downpayment. With the car recovered and resold, even at $300, his
potential loss is only $400.
   With a paying borrower, the bank will profit from interest on
the loan, but the dealer gets interest plus the $1,800 profit on
the car at the time of the sale, DeVoe said.
   While customers get to buy a car when all seems lost, they also
pay dearly for the privilege.
   Interest rates many car dealers charge are well above market
rates. Devoe said financing - with consumer loan-type rates as high
as 25 percent - is structured so the customer makes weekly or
biweekly payments for one to three years on cars ranging in cost
from $2,995 to $5,995.
   DeVoe, an MBA from Indiana University who worked in commercial
loans for Continental Illinois Bank &amp; Trust in Chicago, has been
selling cars for more than two decades. He got his big break at his
father's dealership in Marion.
   DeVoe was attending a meeting in 1978 when another dealer told
him about the buy here-pay here plan and how it sold a lot of extra
cars. The idea became more appealing a year later when a recession
began to set in.
   DeVoe says an initial $19 newspaper ad grossed $8,000. As cash
flow grew, DeVoe's dealership graduated from cheaper cars and low
sales volume to better cars and more profits.
   ``We had to reinvent the wheel one spoke at a time during those
10 years. My God, there's a lot to learn and a lot of mistakes to
be made,'' he said.
   He started sharing those experiences with other dealers in his
Auto Credit Seminars beginning in 1986. He estimates more than 400
dealer organizations and more than 2,500 dealers have attended
them.
   For a $6,295 fee, a dealership can send as many employees it
wants, can return at any time and gets start-up support. A tour of
the local GM stamping plant is thrown in for free.
   Ron Tonkin, former president of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, said he was skeptical when he he first attended
DeVoe's program two years ago. But he says he now has nine buy
here-pay here lots at his 10 dealerships in the Portland, Ore.,
area. It took him 18 months to break even, but now he's seeing
profits.
   ``Anybody that is contemplating going into this, I would
definitely recommend they go to DeVoe's school,'' Tonkin said.
   DeVoe took his buy here-pay here concept a step further last
year when he created J.D. Byrider Systems, a national buy here-pay
here company with 20 dealer franchises from Wilmington, Del. to
Greeley, Colo.
   Franchisees pay a $29,000 fee, a 3 percent royalty fee and 2
percent for advertising.
   ``With our experience in the business, many of the dealers could
use more support, more training, field men, marketing programs done
for them, better operations manuals, and so we feel like there's a
big potential in franchising,'' DeVoe said.

<HEAD>Earthquake Movie Shakes Actress into Disaster Preparation at Home</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lucile in 14th graf is cq</NOTE>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joanna Kerns took her work home with her when
she was filming the NBC miniseries ``The Big One: The Great Los
Angeles Earthquake.''
   Her house is now earthquake-proofed, she says.
   Miss Kerns plays a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist who
fights to make public her evidence that a great earthquake will
strike Los Angeles within a few days. The four-hour show will be
broadcast in two parts Sunday and Monday.
   Miss Kerns, who also stars in the ABC series ``Growing Pains,''
said she strongly identified with her character in the miniseries
because she was torn between duty and cnncern for her family.
   After the temblor strikes in the miniseries, Miss Kerns sets out
on foot across the ravaged city to find her daughter.
   ``I was on stage during the Whittier quake,'' she said,
recalling an earthquake that measured 5.9 on the Richter scale and
killed eight people in October 1987.
   ``My daughter Ashley was visiting me on the lot,'' she said.
``All the stage lights started shaking. Everybody ran offstage. A
stage is a bad place to be because of all the heavy overhead
lights. All I could think of was, where was my daughter? When
something like that happens, you go back to basics.''
   Making the miniseries nearly two years later helped her turn
fear into resolve: to be prepared for any future disaster in
earthquake-prone Southern California.
   ``I had my house bolted to the foundation,'' Miss Kerns said.
``I had the hot water heater and all the heavy furniture bolted
down. I bought earthquake insurance. I think people will learn a
lot from this show. It's very responsible without hitting you over
the head.''
   ``The Big One'' also features Ed Begley Jr., Dan Lauria, Richard
Masur, Joe Spano, Brock Peters, Lindsay Frost, Clarence Gilyard Jr.
and Alan Autry.
   Miss Kerns, in the role of seismologist Claire Winslow, predicts
a devastating earthquake, but city officials fear an announcement
will cause mass panic. A real estate tycoon also tries to silence
her long enough to unload his endangered property.
   It's compelling television despite the employment of every
cliche in the disaster genre: the husband whose career is
jeopardized by his wife's outspokenness, the overzealous assistant,
the television reporter who twists her words into new meanings, and
the weasel-like official trying to conceal the prediction.
   It also has an overlapping crisis with the attempted
assassination of a man likely to become the first black prime
minister of South Africa. What could have been an interesting
subplot soon becomes ludicrous when the would-be assassin, like
Wile E. Coyote, just won't give up no matter how many buildings
fall around him.
   Miss Kerns said she modeled her character on Lucile Jones, a
U.S. Geological Survey seismologist in Pasadena, Calif.
   ``When the last quake occurred, Lucy had to drop her child off
at a day care center so that she could go to work,'' she said.
``She's very dedicated and believes in preparation.''
   Miss Kerns spent what she calls ``a relentless nine weeks''
working on the miniseries last summer.
   ``It was a tough shoot,'' she said. ``In recent times, I've done
`The Preppie Murder,' `Blind Faith' and `Those She Left Behind.' I
directed a play. I'm in `Deadly Intentions II,' which will probably
come on in February. I play the second wife with Harry Hamlin. But
with this, we had such technical dialogue. It has to roll off your
tongue.''
   Miss Kerns is in her sixth season of ``Growing Pains,'' in which
she plays working mother Maggie Seaver. The show also stars Alan
Thicke as her husband and Kirk Cameron, Tracey Gold, Jeremy Miller
and twins Kristen and Kelsey Dohring as the baby sister.
   ``I never thought they would cast me as the mother of a
15-year-old,'' she said of her ``Growing Pains'' role. ``I was too
young. I'd rarely done sitcoms. I was a dramatic actress. Now I
have the best of both worlds. I have a choice of what I want to do.
   ``The kids on the show are growing up and out of the house. It's
hard to hide the fact that they're growing up when Jeremy's now
taller than I am.''
   Miss Kerns is unmarried in real life, but said with a laugh:
``I'm looking for a great guy, with a great sense of humor, who
likes that I'm an actress.''
   Not long before ``Growing Pains,'' Miss Kerns thought she might
become a writer. She and a partner, Becky Ayers, have written a
script for the show, and she now is working on several writing
projects.
   ``I was tired of playing the dumb blonde,'' she said. ``I dyed
my hair brown and did a lot of character roles. I decided to write
because I wanted something I could control. I guess letting go
helped, because I got the series `The Four Seasons.' After that,
things began to happen for me.''

<BYLINE>Cable's Battle of the Barristers To Start Next Year
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For many of us, the law is a giant firm called
Whereas, Habeus &amp; Big Fee, full of dark mystery, talk in strange
tongues and blood oaths never to use a simple declarative sentence.
   But help is on the way: Next year, two new cable channels will
debut - one tentatively called American Courtroom Network, the
other definitely called In Court.
   The channels likely will disappoint ``Perry Mason'' fans used to
watching a trial reach a critical phase and then hearing a
prosecution witness suddenly shriek: ``Yes, I killed him, the
swine! And I'd do it again!'' But they may enlighten viewers about
our legal system.
   Both channels will televise criminal and civil trials, live and
on tape, and try to explain the law to civilians. The coverage
won't be restricted to state courts, either. Limited coverage of
federal civil court trials also is in the wings.
   There'll be no Judge Wapners here:
   Presiding anchor for ``Courtroom'' - Fred Graham, lawyer and
former law correspondent for CBS News.
   Presiding analyst for ``In Court'' - Arthur Miller, Harvard law
professor, and contributor to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   While each channel will do its best to keep things interesting,
it is a fact that even the most sensational murder case has long
moments of mundane.
   And it remains to be seen whether the public, already used to TV
coverage of key cases in state courts - particularly by local
stations and Cable News Network - is ready for cable's new, heavy
double dose of the living law.
   The public may get some real-McCoy law on at least one of the
networks, too, albeit in a far smaller portion. CBS News is
considering a half-hour series, ``On Trial,'' a taped, condensed
version of a trial from start to finish.
   All this comes at time the four networks are rife with the
make-believe variety of lawyering. Viewers can choose from CBS'
``The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,'' ABC's ``Gabriel's Fire,'' NBC's
``Law and Order'' and ``L.A. Law,'' and Fox Broadcasting's
``Against the Law.''
   Be that as it may, In Court, which says it plans to begin
operations early next year, will start with 14 hours of programming
a day, beginning at 6 a.m. Eastern time. It plans to become a
24-hour operation in 1993. On weekends, it will replay highlights
from the previous week.
   Courtroom will offer law 24 hours a day, though its chief,
Steven Brill, won't say when next year it will start.
   The nighttime half of Courtoom will be a taped replay of each
day's coverage, says Graham, a genial Tennessean who is doubling as
the operation's managing editor.
   Although the channel is for ``people, not lawyers,'' he says,
with a perfectly straight face, it will set aside Saturday and
Sunday mornings for ``our legal ghetto'' - shows ``basically by
lawyers for lawyers.''
   ``I don't know,'' he says, when asked if there's room for two
channels devoted to the same topic. ``I certainly have heard plenty
of people say that the logic runs against having two.''
   There is anti-logic precedent. The same question was raised last
April when Viacom's HA! took on HBO's The Comedy Channel in a
multimillion-dollar chuckles contest. Neither has folded yet, and
the battle continues.
   It helps, though, that each is backed by corporations with deep
pockets. The same applies in the coming court fight on cable.
   The owner of In Court is a major cable company, Cablevision
Systems Corp.
   Courtroom is a venture of Time Warner, Inc., another major cable
player, and Brill, an attorney, journalist and publisher of 11
magazines, including American Lawyer. Their limited partnership is
called American Lawyer Media.
   ``The meat and potatoes of what we're going to do is cover real
courtroom trials,'' says Graham. ``It will be a mix of live and
taped.''
   The service won't confine itself to trial coverage, though, he
says.
   ``We're going to be in all kinds of nooks and crannies of the
judicial system,'' he says, from small claims court to liquor
license hearings.
   In Court general manager Dennis Patton says his service
primarily will offer live ``gavel-to-gavel'' coverage of important
trials.
   But it also will have non-trial segments on legal matters and
issues, hosted by veteran actor E.G. Marshall.
   In Court also will start each weekday with a preview of the
day's coming cases, and report state, federal and international
legal news in sort of a ``Today'' show of law, Patton says.
   Both services already have begun taping trials, some well-known,
some not. The latter includes a date-rape trial that Courtroom
taped in Atlanta.
   In Court covered the recent trial of 2 Live Crew, and each
caught Cincinnati's equally publicized Mapplethorpe obscenity
trial.
   Forty-five states now allow some form of TV coverage of courts,
although some allow cameras only in appellate courts, Graham says.
Not all the states are equal in permitting trial coverage; some are
more restrictive than others.
   For that reason, he says, his channel is concentrating on ``a
core of about 13 states'' - including California, New York,
Florida, Nevada and Massachussetts - ``that are quite liberal in
letting us in.''
   Next July, the beady electronic eye of TV also will be allowed
in federal courts in a limited three-year test run, the first break
in a 53-year ban on cameras and sound gear in those courts.
   But only civil cases can be televised, and only in six selected
trial courts. Cameras also will be allowed in two federal appeals
courts.
   Despite the restrictions, Graham, who covered the Supreme Court
during his 15 years at CBS, sees even the limited TV peeps into
federal court as a hopeful sign. He even thinks TV may enter the
nation's highest court, the Supreme Court, possibly by 1994.
   As preparations of the court channels continue, so does a sort
of reverse voir dire process in which the jury - the nation's cable
system operators - questions the opposing parties to decide if they
want to carry either channel.
   These jurors can challenge the cable petitioners for cause -
'cause advertising revenue is down everywhere, 'cause their profit
margins keep shrinking, or 'cause their systems lack the capacity
for yet another new service.
   ``All those factors make it especially difficult,'' says Erica
Gruen, a cable analyst.
   But hope springs eternal, and not just in the court channels.
   About 12 new cable channels, from the Cowboy Channel to a
24-hour talk show channel, plan start-ups from the fourth quarter
of this year through next spring, says Gruen, a vice president at
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising.
   Why? Despite the trying times of cable now, she says, ``the
potential is tremendous - that's what truly draws people in.''
   She still recalls a friend who a decade ago ``thought the idea
of CNN was stupid. He said, `Who wants to watch news all day long?'
''
   Begun in 1980 by Ted Turner, the Atlanta-based 24-hour channel
now is seen in 57 million homes and offices and, CNN says, in 100
countries.

<HEAD>Former Stasi Agents Mourn Passing of Privilege and Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLM, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They joined because it paid well, offered
them a fine education and a nice home, put them in a position of
power and privilege.
   To many, working for the East German secret police was a
glamorous and exciting way to make a living.
   No longer. The fear and obedience the so-called Stasi once
instilled have been replaced by open hostility. The profession's
prized perks have slipped away.
   Peter Kuntze now shovels coal on the college campus where he was
once a highly paid professor of criminology, an elite member of an
exclusive club.
   For 16 years he worked as a Stasi detective who dissected
information on his countrymen. For nearly two decades after that,
he trained new generations of Stasi officers.
   Now Kuntze is a 54-year-old laborer working in the boiler room
that supplies heat to the old Stasi spy school, now a teacher's
college specializing in language and music.
   ``I don't regret my work for the Stasi,'' said Kuntze, a father
of five. ``I only regret that I put my heart and soul into it. I'm
now in a position where I can only do unskilled labor.''
   Dietrich Fischer, 52, once specialized in tracking down Western
spies, a ``very analytical'' job he found quite exciting. Today,
the former Stasi colonel works as headmaster of a kindergarten.
Instead of foreign agents, he keeps track of squealing children.
   ``Everyone thinks it's comical,'' he says, smiling.
   Because of the stifling hold they kept on society, because of
the paranoia and dread they created, the hatred for these people
remains intense in what was East Germany.
   What to do with them is one of the deep social dilemmas
confronting the united Germany as it brings the old Communist
society - the oppressed and the oppressors together - into a free
world.
   Contrary to popular belief, most Stasi agents are not hiding.
Most are still out there, mixing in the new society, holding jobs
or looking for them.
   After years of serving as a government's iron fist on a cowed
society, however, it is the once-feared Stasi who now fear the
people.
   One of the most cloistered pockets of this privileged elite used
to be the old Stasi officers' college outside Golm, a small village
about 25 miles southwest of Berlin.
   The school was a top-secret, invitation-only training center
that offered a broad education to only the brightest young officer
candidates.
   About 30 gray, block-like buildings stand on the end of a
winding, secluded road. The campus is an incongruous, icily
intimidating mix of ivy-covered walls and high-security fences.
   The school was closed in January and turned over to the
teacher's college in nearby Potsdam.
   Much of the old faculty still lives in a 30-house neighborhood
near campus, a horseshoe-shaped complex of neat homes with spacious
yards and private car ports.
   The people here say the land has been put in public trust to be
sold. Their offers to buy their homes have been spurned. The
telephone system has been removed.
   Most of them personally deny the allegations of Stasi brutality
and corruption now chronicled daily in the German press. All
nations have secret services, they say.
   ``If someone says something against us, it's impossible to prove
it wrong,'' says Kuntze. ``People can say whatever they want.''
   Kuntze joined the Stasi in 1956 because the pay and
opportunities were so good, he said. He specialized in collating
information, weighing its accuracy and value.
   As a teacher, he taught prospective Stasi officers how to
develop informants.
   ``It was part of the work, nothing negative,'' he said.
``Unofficial sources were necessary to any secret service.''
   One of the Stasi's jobs was to check the pulse of public
sentiment. But Kuntze said this information often was ignored, or
lost in labyrinthine bureaucracy.
   ``If the information had been exploited in the right way, there
would have been changes'' that would have precluded last autumn's
revolution, he said.
   Of the 85,000 people who worked for the Stasi, about
45,000-50,000 were actual field agents, each of whom had two or
three paid informants in workplaces or schools, he said.
   Former agents say potential Stasi recruits were singled out
early, often as young as 13.
   They were watched for years. Kuntze said people were excluded if
they demonstrated an inordinate amount of fear, gossiped too much,
or had relatives in the West.
   Ullrich Heidenreich followed such a career path.
   Fashionably dressed and lounging in a handsomely furnished
living room, the 34-year-old Heidenreich and his wife, Martina,
could be any upwardly mobile young couple.
   The son of a police officer, he was recruited when he was 16 and
joined two years later. He worked as a Stasi guard on the
Czechoslovak border, then as an operative in Karl Marx City.
   Like other top recruits, he was sent to school. He was trained
as a lawyer and became a professor at the Stasi school.
   Unlike other teachers, he found a job in his field after he was
fired.
   Heidenreich now teaches law at a police academy in Potsdam. He
teaches West German law, which he spent nine months studying.
   He does not expect to keep this job once a united German
government takes a closer look at the people on its public
payrolls.
   But he's optimistic about finding new work.
   ``People who are competent hold positions of responsibility,''
he said. ``People who are incompetent want us out. Those who have
nothing try to drive the bright ones out by shouting `Stasi.' ''
   The couple are prepared to move West to advance their careers.
   ``This virulent campaign against the Stasi is really a symptom
of the East,'' he said. ``In the West, people are more realistic.
Here, there is too much emotion.''
   The former Stasi captain has no qualms about shifting his
ideology, nor apologies about his past.
   ``As long as you are socially well off, you don't ask questions
and you don't rock the boat,'' he said.
   ``I'm not saying I was convinced that what I did was wrong. When
I worked for the Stasi, I believed it was right,'' he said. ``I'm
only saying that I can learn the new way.''
   Communist Party and Stasi officials were well paid, with
tremendous perks and fine homes. Heidenreich said he and his wife
have ``a lot of money, but not as a much as people think.''
   Kuntze, Fischer and Heidenreich all made about 3,000 marks
(about $1,950) a month as teachers, more than triple the average
East German wage.
   Kuntze and Fischer say they make about one-third that now.
Heidenreich makes about 1,900 marks ($1,250).
   Some have not done so well.
   Juergen Kanis, 34, has a law degree in a legal system that no
longer exists, a Marxist-Leninist philosophy doctorate in a
capitalist nation - and no job in a free market.
   Kanis, a father of two, says he has lost three jobs in the last
year because of his Stasi past.
   The Stasi recruited him as farm boy and sent him to Karl Marx
University. It gave him a job and turned him into a teacher of the
ideology that created it.
   That was the way things were in those days, Kanis said.
   ``If the CIA came to you, would you say no?'' he asks.

   Few sectors of East German society scaped the
scrutiny of the Stasi. The Communist secret police created an aura
of paranoia that still lingers.
   More than 85,000 people were members. More than twice that
number were informers who worked in factories, businesses and
schools.
   East German workers and students were broken down into small,
manageable work groups. Former agents say each such group contained
at least one paid informant.
   About 9,000 Stasi members monitored telephone conversations.
   People considered to be nonconformists were denied good jobs and
housing. Their mail was disrupted. Many were jailed on trumped-up
charges, others beaten.
   Border guards, all Stasi members, killed people who tried to
flee the country.
   Stasi agents regularly interviewed government officials and
factory bosses. The conversations were taped, transcribed and
filed.
   Many former Stasi officials and Communist Party functionaries
are believed to have a disproportionate share of the wealth,
property and businesses in what was East Germany.
   David Gill of the committee overseeing the Stasi's dissolution
said most members are working in factories, on pensions or
unemployed, but many run established businesses or have parlayed
connections and money into new ones.
   Lawmakers are debating whether to grant amnesty to some Stasi
members and prosecute others.
   The Stasi foreign unit acted as an espionage agency. About 60
Stasi spies have been arrested in recent months in what formerly
was West Germany.
   Erich Mielke, former chief of the Stasi, is in jail awaiting
prosecution on charges of corruption, harboring leftist terrorists
and other crimes.

<HEAD>Democrats in Tough Races in Nation's Largest States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats expect to improve their hold on the
nation's governorships this year, but they face tough battles to
wrest control of the largest states from the Republicans.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, the head of the Democratic Governors'
Association, predicts a net gain of one to four governorships for
his party this year.
   Republicans, who gained eight seats when many of these same
governors were up four years ago, would be content just to hold
their own this time.
   Democrats have the upper hand in the nation's statehouses going
into the elections, controlling 29 governorships to the GOP's 21.
But the party that controls the biggest states will be pleased no
matter the outcome of the rest.
   ``Much more important than the raw number of gains or losses is
which states go which way,'' says political analyst Charlie Cook.
``Unlike House or Senate seats, all governorships are not created
equal, and it is the megastates this year that really count.''
   The reason is redistricting. Legislatures will draw new
congressional district lines next year that may change of face of
their U.S. House delegations. Both parties would like to hold the
veto stamp in states facing big gains or losses in their
congressional delegations.
   Republicans control the governorships in four of the biggest
states that are up this year: California, Texas, Florida and
Illinois.
   California's legislature will figure out how to distribute as
many as seven new congressional seats next year, based on the
state's population gain in preliminary Census figures. Democrats
control the legislature there, and Republicans say they need the
governorship to ensure a fair map.
   Texas and Florida will gain new House seats too, while Illinois
stands to lose two seats.
   In only one of those states, Florida, is the incumbent seeking
re-election. Florida Gov. Bob Martinez has come from behind to a
virtual tie with Democratic challenger Lawton Chiles, the former
senator.
   The high-stakes California race is considered deadlocked too.
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson faces Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the
former mayor of San Francisco. Republican Gov. George Deukmejian is
retiring after two terms.
   In Texas, flamboyant Republican Clayton Williams has held a lead
over Democrat Ann Richards. Richards has pulled closer in recent
polls, however, and has accused Williams' campaign of encouraging
reports she once used drugs.
   In Illinois, Republican Jim Edgar once led in his bid to replace
retiring Gov. Jim Thompson. But in a reversal of normal tax
rhetoric it is the Democrat, Neil Hartigan, who has trumpeted a
no-tax pledge to turn the race into a tossup.
   Among the Democratic governors who control big states,
Michigan's Gov. Jim Blanchard has a substantial lead in his bid for
a third term. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is a sure thing for
re-election. So is Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, the most prominent
anti-abortion Democrat.
   In other contested states that Democrats now control:
   - Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis retires reviled just two
years after leading his party to presidential defeat. Democrat John
Silber, a university president, won the nomination in a repudiation
of Dukakis. He leads his GOP opponent, although Republican William
Weld is within striking distance.
   - Republican George Voinovich, the former Cleveland mayor, leads
in the Ohio governor's race, where Democrat Celeste is retiring.
The Democratic candidate, Anthony Celebrezze, has tried to make his
support for abortion rights a deciding issue. But Celebrezze has
been criticized for his dramatic switch from an abortion opponent
late last year.
   - Minnesota was a state Republicans had hopes of reclaiming from
Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich. But Republican Jon Grunseth has been
rocked by allegations that he swam nude with teen-age girls at a
party nine years ago. Grunseth has backed up his denials with a
polygraph test but he trails in the polls.
   - Democrats are in danger of losing Connecticut, where Gov.
William O'Neill is retiring. The Democratic nominee is running
third behind former GOP Sen. Lowell Weicker, who is running as an
independent.
   - In Oregon, another state where a Democrat is retiring, the
race between Republican Dave Frohnmayer and Democrat Barbara
Roberts is close.
   Republican incumbents are in danger in at least four states:
Rhode Island, Nebraska, Kansas and Maine.
   Worst for Republicans is Rhode Island, where Gov. Ed DiPrete is
far behind Democrat Bruce Sundlun, who lost to DiPrete in the last
two elections.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr and her Kansas neighbor, Mike Hayden, both
have been in trouble for tax increases, but both have narrowed the
gap by which they trailed Democratic challengers.
   Hayden has rebounded as his Democratic opponent, Joan Finney,
has struggled to explain her opposition to abortion. Recent polls
have shown Hayden winning the women's vote.
   Maine's Republican Gov. John McKernan has also made a partial
recovery in the polls but still faces a tough race with Joseph
Brennan, a former governor who replaced McKernan in Congress four
years ago.
   Among other Republican incumbents, Alabama's Guy Hunt and Iowa's
Terry Branstad both hold leads against strong challengers.
   Republicans face uphill battles to hang on in Oklahoma and New
Mexico, where GOP incumbents are retiring. Democrats expect to hang
on to the Arizona seat, which they took over when Republican Gov.
Evan Mecham was impeached.
   In Alaska, the entry of former GOP Gov. Walter Hickel as
third-party candidate has confused a toss-up race. Former GOP Gov.
Richard Snelling leads in Vermont, where the Democratic incumbent
is retiring.
   Democratic incumbents have leads in polls or are rated likely
winners in Colorado, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, Tennessee, Idaho and
Wyoming. Republican incumbents are rated favorites in South
Carolina, South Dakota, Wisconsin and New Hampshire.

<HEAD>Analysts See Marginal Shifts in Democratic-Controlled House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With voter outrage high and Congress appearing
incompetent, House incumbents face the 1990 elections with anxiety.
   Political experts predict no more than marginal shifts in the
Democratic-controlled House, but caution that this year's voting
could hold some surprises.
   ``There's clearly a pretty strong sense of anger out among the
voters, and it is directed both at politics and politicians as much
as incumbents,'' said Geoff Garin, a pollster with the Democratic
firm of Peter Hart.
   ``There is a sense that people in government only care about
politics, and not about what's right and wrong,'' he said.
   Neil Newhouse, a pollster with Richard Wirthlin's Republican
firm, was more blunt: ``The political environment is going to hell
in a handbasket.''
   Most of the action in the nation's 435 congressional districts
will be in the 29 races where there is no incumbent seeking
re-election.
   Democrats have a lopsided advantage in that category. They are
defending 11 of the open seats, while Republicans must try to hang
on to 18 districts. The GOP openings include 11 districts where
otherwise safe Republican House members decided to run for Senate
seats or statewide office.
   There could be volatility among incumbents as well.
   Several already are threatened by association with the nation's
savings and loan scandal: Denny Smith, R-Ore.; Charles Pashayan,
R-Calif.; and Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.
   Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is in trouble over using his
official credit card to charge for hundreds of dollars worth of
long-distance phone calls to a woman who worked for a lobbying
company. Reps. Craig James, R-Fla., and Stan Parris, R-Va., have
been targeted by strong Democratic challengers who made an issue of
their opposition to abortion.
   The political year for incumbents has been a roller coaster of
changing issues, complicated by Congress' inability to finish its
work and adjourn. That has had the effect of compressing the
campaign season to its shortest length since World War II.
   Early in the year, experts were pointing to strong pro-choice
votes on Capitol Hill and a newly invigorated women's lobby as
signs that abortion would be a dominant issue in the elections. In
quick succession, that issue was followed by politicking over the
savings-and-loan scandal, flag desecration, congressional ethics
and campaign finance, environmental protection vs. jobs and the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Then came the government's paralysis over the budget, leaving a
bad taste that was likely to remain with voters even after final
agreements were worked out for trimming the federal deficit.
   ``The whole budget process has given voters a focal point ...
for the frustration with government and politicians,'' Newhouse
said.
   Both parties predict a Democratic pickup of fewer than 10 seats,
padding the majority party's current 258 to 176 advantage. But the
volatility of the season could yield a far greater shift if angry
voters go to the polls in a throw-the-bums-out mood.
   Among the hottest contests to watch on Election Day:
   - In Washington's 3rd District, freshman Rep. Jolene Unsoeld has
been squeezed by her stand for the endangered spotted owl, and
against the cutting of old-growth forests that are its home. To
mollify angry loggers, she assumed the lead on an anti-gun-control
issue in the House backed by the National Rifle Association.
Republicans believe their candidate, former state Rep. Bob
Williams, has an even shot at defeating her.
   - Analysts say the fate of GOP Rep. Peter Smith in Vermont will
be a good gauge of voter anger. Smith supported an early budget
proposal that included heavy new taxes on home heating oil,
anathema in the Northeast. And his opponent, socialist former
Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders, was campaigning as an
anti-Washington populist even before it became fashionable. If he
pulls it off, Sanders would be the first socialist in Congress in
six decades.
   - Another bellwether of anti-incumbency will be in
Massachusetts, where Rep. Chester Atkins is known as an abrasive
and aloof figure. Atkins' role as chairman of the Democratic Party
in a state that is in open revolt against its establishment cannot
help. Republicans have high hopes for their challenger, state Rep.
John MacGovern.
   - Several incumbents of both parties are in trouble simply
because they represent politically polarized districts: Republicans
James Inhofe of Oklahoma and John Hiler of Indiana, and Democrats
James Clarke of North Carolina, Bill Sarpalius of Texas, George
Brown of California and George Sangmeister of Illinois. Political
analyst Charles Cook predicts that most of the undecided vote this
year will go against incumbents, which could hurt those in marginal
districts.
   - Former Cincinnati Mayor Kenneth Blackwell stands a good chance
of being the first black Republican in the House since 1935.
Blackwell is in a tight race with current Mayor Charles Luken,
whose Democratic father, Rep. Thomas Luken, is retiring.
   - The Idaho seat of Republican Rep. Larry Craig, who is running
for the Senate, is up for grabs. Polls show Democrat Larry LaRocco,
a stockbroker and former Senate aide, deadlocked with GOP state
Sen. C.M. ``Skip'' Smyser in a district that leans Republican.

<HEAD>Ballots Feature Bitter Medicine for Taxes, Schools, Politicians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Angry voters have loaded state ballots with the most citizen
initiatives in 76 years, aiming to slash taxes, clean the
environment, improve schools and limit the terms of politicians.
   Their often-snappy nicknames - ``Big Green,'' ``Son of Jarvis,''
the ``Two Percent Solution'' - belie the unusual stringency of many
of the tax revolt, environmental and political term limitation
proposals to be decided on Nov. 6.
   ``Citizens across the country are feeling anger toward the way
government is performing, nd they are expressing that anger
through the initiative process,'' said John Keast, who monitors
ballot measures for the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative
research group in Washington, D.C.
   In all, voters in 43 states and the District of Columbia will
decide 236 ballot questions, according to the foundation. The
majority were referred to the ballot by state legislators.
   More tellingly, 67 are citizen-initiated ballot measures - the
most since the Progressive Era in 1914 when a record 90 appeared on
state ballots.
   Voter wrath could be most keenly felt in Massachusetts, where
passage of Question 3 would result in the largest voter-initiated
state tax cut in history: $2 billion, or 15 percent of the state's
budget. Opponents argue it would bankrupt poor school districts,
seriously damage others, and lead to tens of thousands of state
layoffs. Polls, nonetheless, show broad support.
   Taxing and spending limits appear on ballots in ten other
states, including Nebraska, where a proposed ``Two Percent
Solution'' would impose a 2 percent lid on state and local budget
increases.
   Colorado and California voters will decide whether to limit the
length elected officials can serve. A proposed state ethics panel
is also on the California ballot. Kansas City, Mo., residents may
limit City Council terms.
   Arizonans will decide whether their state legislators deserve a
raise to $24,000 from $15,000.
   Californians face their usual prodigious load of statewide
measures: 28 in all, including questions ranging from saving
ancient redwoods to raising alcohol taxes.
   By far the most closely-watched initiative is Proposition 128, a
sweeping environmental issue called ``Big Green'' by backers
including Robin Williams, Sylvester Stallone and many other
Hollywood stars. It would phase out pesticides known to cause
cancer, ban oil development in state waters, ban chemicals that
harm the ozone, and require a dramatic reduction in emissions of
gases that contribute to global warming.
   Important environmental issues are being considered in other
states:
   -Washington voters could require that state to set up boards
mandating local land use planning;
   -Oregonians may impose strict recycling codes and force the
shutdown of the state's only nuclear power plant;
   -Missourians consider sweeping protections for Ozark mountain
streams;
   -New Yorkers decide on a $2 billion environment bond;
   -South Dakotans may limit Black Hills mining and restrict
garbage dumping;
   -Arizona and Minnesota may dedicate portions of state lottery
proceeds to preserving the environment.
   Another potentially explosive California measure, dubbed ``Son
of Jarvis'' in memory of Howard Jarvis, father of Proposition 13,
would forbid any tax increase without a two-thirds legislative or
electoral majority.
   Among noteworthy local California issues, Santa Clara County
will consider whether to finance a new stadium to lure the San
Francisco Giants, Sacramento voters will decide on a city-county
merger that would make it the nation's seventh largest county, San
Franciscans will consider a ``domestic partners'' measure allowing
non-married live-in couples, including homosexuals, to register
their relationships with city officials, while affluent Pacific
Grove may float a $1.2 million bond for a butterfly habitat.
   Meanwhile, the course of school reform could be on the line in
several states.
   The most crucial in the eyes of the nation's educators is
Oregon's ``choice'' initiative allowing parents a $2,500 tax credit
for educating their children in anywhere they wish, including
private or parochial schools, or even at home.
   The Bush administration applauds choice as a key to better
schools. But teacher unions and others in the education
establishment are fighting to keep the measure from passing,
fearing it would unleash similar measures around the country to the
detriment of public schools.
   Nebraskans will decide whether to repeal a tax reform passed
last year aimed at shifting the burden of school financing from the
property tax by increasing sales and income taxes.
   In Arizona, Proposition 103, the Classroom Improvement
Initiative, would require the legislature to increase public school
spending by $100 per pupil in each of the next 10 years. The
pricetag has been estimated at up to $6 billion.
   In Kansas, voters will settle a political tug of war by deciding
a proposed amendment that would, in effect, give the state
legislature near-total control over school governance, stripping
the state board of education and board of regents of much of their
independence.
   Elsewhere:
   -Oregon and Nevada take up abortion rights issues;
   -Arkansas considers a proposed lottery;
   -Staten Islanders decide whether to study a possible secession
from New York City;
   -Alaskans may recriminalize marijuana;
   -Montanans may make their cigarette taxes the nation's highest;
   -Florida could require a three-day wait for handgun purchases;
   -Arizona may end a 15-year tiff over a proposed Martin Luther
King paid holiday;
   -and Maine mulls a repeal of one of the nation's toughest blue
laws.

<HEAD>The Face of Congress To Be Decided in Key State Races</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partisan makeup of the House for the next
decade rests largely with voters in a dozen states this year. A
they choose governors and state legislators, these voters will be
picking the powerbrokers for major redistricting battles.
   The arcane redistricting process draws little attention from
voters. But national political parties are pouring millions of
dollars and advice into state legislative races that often are
ignored in Washington except in years ending in zero.
   Redistricting occurs once a decade after the Census Bureau
completes its decennial head count. The population figures are used
to redistribute U.S. House seats among the 50 states and to redraw
congressional district lines.
   Some 19 House seats are expected to shift as a result of the
1990 Census. Most of them will move from the Democratic-leaning
Northeast and Midwest to the more conservative South and West,
where Republicans have enjoyed success in congressional and
presidential elections but lag behind Democrats at the state level.
   Democrats enter the redistricting process with a decided edge
and hope gains this year will serve as a springboard to 1992, when
the party will try again to wrest control of the White House from
the GOP.
   Republicans for most of the 1980s touted their ``1991 Plan'' as
the means of escaping their nearly 40 years as minority party in
the House. But the GOP now finds itself scrambling to defend its
major redistricting power bases against formidable Democratic
challenges.
   Already, the GOP is threatening to press legal challenges to
partisan plans it expects the Democrats to craft.
   ``We're in position this year to successfully defend most if not
all of our redistricting strengths and then peel off a few if not
more from the Republicans,'' said Tim Dickson, executive director
of the Democratic Party's redistricting arm, Project 500.
   At stake is nothing less than control of the House through the
year 2003; even modest Democratic gains would cement Republicans as
the minority party for the foreseeable future.
   Party operatives say new computer analyses that mix Census
demographics with voting records will allow anyone with a monopoly
on redistricting to fashion no-lose districts.
   ``You can slice up a state and preordain the results with
incredible accuracy,'' said Ben Ginsberg, the Republican National
Committee's chief counsel.
   The Republicans hoped for big gains after 17 seats shifted from
the Frost Belt to the Sun Belt after the 1980 Census. But Democrats
controlled much of the map drawing and ended up with a net gain of
three seats.
   The shifting is called reapportionment, the Census Bureau term
for deciding how many of the 435 House seats go to each state. Once
that's done the states - in most cases their legislatures - take on
the task of redistricting, literally redrawing the lines of each
congressional district.
   There are 6,144 legislative seats up for election in 46 states.
There are no legislative races this year in Virginia, New Jersey,
Mississippi and Kentucky.
   After years of exhaustive research, the parties have narrowed
their targets to a handful to a dozen races in each of the major
redistricting battlegrounds - primarily states that are gaining or
losing seats.
   Fourteen of the shifting seats - and their accompanying
electoral votes in presidential elections - will be gobbled up by
California, Florida and Texas.
   In those states, Republicans now control the governor's office
but face stiff challenges this year.
   At the legislative level in those states, only control of the
Florida Senate appears in question; Democrats enjoy sizeable
advantages in both chambers of the Texas and California
legislatures and in the Florida House.
   Republicans are mounting an aggressive effort to pick up the
four seats they need to control the Florida Senate, which would
give the GOP a voice in redistricting should Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez lose his re-election bid.
   Democrats are cautiously optimistic they will retain their edge.
   The fight in the state destined to be the biggest redistricting
loser, New York, focuses on the state Senate, where Democrats need
a net gain of four seats to win a monopoly on redistricting.
   ``If that happens what you will see is blatant political
gerrymandering,'' said the RNC's Ginsberg.
   He won't get an argument from Democrats on that point.
   ``The process is inherently political,'' said Democratic
National Committee redistricting guru Mark Bohannon. ``It was
designed that way, to benefit winners.''
   President Bush has visited New York to help the GOP's state
Senate effort, and Gov. Mario Cuomo is working hard for the
Democrats. New York likely will lose three of its 34 House seats.
   Democrats also are spending heavily in hopes of gaining
redistricting monopolies in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Michigan.
They hope to capture the senates in Pennsylvania and Michigan and
both chambers in Indiana, where the GOP has two-seat majorities in
the House and Senate. With the Ohio gubernatorial contest leaning
Republican, Democrats also are targeting the Ohio Senate, where
they need a gain of three seats to win total control of the state
legislature.
   The party has realistic shots at those goals but faces uphill
odds in trying to erase slim GOP majorities in both chambers of the
Arizona legislature and the Colorado House.
   Democrats find themselves playing defense in the Florida Senate
contests as well as in Illinois, where Republicans need to gain two
seats to capture the Senate. Republicans also are trying to take
over the lower chambers in Pennsylvania and Oregon, needing a gain
of three seats in each state.
   The Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio contests are
particularly important because each of these states is likely to
lose two congressional seats. Control over redistricting will
decide which incumbents get squeezed.
   The other likely losers are Massachusetts, New Jersey, West
Virginia, Kentucky, Iowa, Louisiana, Kansas and Montana. Those
eight states will lose one seat each, according to preliminary
Census data.
   The redistricting winners are led by California, which should
gain seven seats and see its House delegation grow to 52. Florida's
expected gain of four would bring its House delegation to 23. The
likely pickup of three seats by Texas would swell its
representation in the House to 30.
   Together, these states would supply 24 percent of House members
and hold 105 Electoral College votes - 38 percent of the 270 needed
to win the White House.
   The other gainers, expected to pick up one seat each, likely
will be Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Washington.
   Heading into the elections there were just four states - Idaho,
Kansas, New Hampshire and South Dakota - in which Republicans have
outright control over state government and none of them are
considered major redistricting battlegrounds.
   Democrats, on the other hand, hold the governor's office and
control both legislative chambers in 15 states and at least two of
the three seats at the redistricting table in 23 others.

   Pan Am Corp., one of the oldest and financially
weakest U.S. airlines, will sell important trans-Atlantic routes
and other assets to larger rival UAL Corp. for $400 million, the
companies announced.
   The agreement announced Tuesday came months after fruitless
efforts by Pan Am to find a merger partner or buyer for the
airline, which pioneered world air travel more than a half-century
ago but lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade
of heightened competition inspired by airline deregulation.
   It also marks a major expansion by UAL, the parent of
Chicago-based United Airlines, which bought Pan Am's prized Pacific
routes five years ago for $750 million and has since become a key
airline in that part of the world.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Oil prices stabilized after a record drop the
day before took futures prices below $30 per barrel.
   Light sweet crude for December delivery settled at $29.37 per
barrel Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down $1.04 from
the previous day's December bid.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The sharp fall in oil prices has wiped out most
of the ``war premium'' whipped up by the Persian Gulf crisis, but
consumers shouldn't expect much of a break at the gas pump
immediately.
   Home heating oil will probably be even slower to fall at the
retail level, analysts said Tuesday as critics of the oil industry
renewed their cries of price-gouging.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. personal income growth slowed during the
second quarter, with incomes declining in Iowa and Nebraska, the
Commerce Department said.
   A study by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis showed
national income growth decelerating from 2.1 percent in the first
quarter to 1.3 percent from April through June. It weakened in five
of the nation's eight regions.
   The report was a reflection of the sluggish growth of the
general economy, which dipped from 1.7 percent in the January-March
quarter to 0.4 percent in the next. Many economists believe the
nation is headed for a recession, if it is not already in one.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The House Banking Committee voted to trim the
Bush administration's request for as much as $57 billion more for
the savings and loan bailout to $10 billion.
   Both Democrats and Republicans on the panel suggested that
Congress should deny more money for the bailout in view of
President Bush's assertion a year ago that ``never again'' would
taxpayers be tapped for it and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's
refusal to testify why that has changed.
   But warned by regulators the bailout's total costs might swell
another $250 million to $300 million in the next three months
without the funds, the committee approved just enough money to keep
the program going through February.

   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) - Walt Disney Co. has formed a film
production financing partnership worth at least $600 million,
backed largely by Japanese investors.
   The new partnership, Touchwood Pacific Partners I, will become
the company's main source of finance for all live-action films at
Disney's three studios: Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures.
   The $600 million financing will be based on $180 million raised
from Japanese investors. Another $420 million will take the form of
a line of credit from a consortium of banks led by Citicorp's
Citibank.

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) - Warner Bros. will pay $125 million
for video rights to many MGM-UA films, with the money helping to

Co., the companies announced Tuesday.
   The deal puts into place another piece of the complex sale of
MGM-UA to Pathe, headed by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti.

   DALLAS (AP) - Southland Corp., the nation's largest convenience
store chain, appeared to have lost its fight to avoid bankruptcy,
although enough creditors had agreed to speed the company's
reorganization process.
   The parent of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain had asked
creditors to approve either a debt swap or a so-called
``prepackaged'' Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan.
   Early indications Tuesday were that the restructuring had fallen
far short of the 95 percent approval Southland had sought, but a
majority of creditors had agreed to go along with the bankruptcy
option.

Inc. customer said that Michael Milken offered him a personal
investment in a 1985 takeover after his company bought a large

indicating Milken may have directly given favors to big clients

   The sharp fall in oil prices has wiped out most
of the ``war premium'' whipped up by the Persian Gulf crisis, but
consumers shouldn't expect much of a break at the gas pump
immediately.
   Home heating oil will probably be even slower to fall at the
retail level, analysts said Tuesday as critics of the oil industry
renewed their cries of price-gouging.
   Those who follow the pricing of oil and refined petroleum
products say that although rising crude prices usually bring rapid
increases in consumer prices, drops in crude usually don't work
their way into the retail level for a few weeks.
   ``Product prices tend to lag,'' said Philip L. Dodge, an analyst
with Nomura Securities International Inc. ``People who have
established those high prices tend to give them up grudgingly.''
   Oil prices in the futures market have tumbled from a peak above
$40 to less than $30 per barrel as signs of a peaceful solution to
the Gulf standoff have proliferated.
   Light sweet crude for December delivery was pegged at $29.37 per
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at the close of trading
Tuesday.
   Dodge predicted retail gasoline prices will dip a bit in the
near future, while home heating oil might even go up, largely for
seasonal reasons.
   ``On gasoline, normally it would come down at this time of year
anyway,'' Dodge said. ``Heating oil would be the reverse.''
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, retail gasoline prices have
gone up about 30.5 cents per gallon, according to an American
Automobile Association survey Tuesday that showed pump prices were
rising even as crude oil was falling over the past week. Home
heating oil costs in the Northeast are likewise running about 30
cents to 40 cents per gallon higher than they were at the same time
last year.
   ``I can't imagine much decrease,'' said Thomas Blakeslee, an
energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
``It's usually a lag of about two or three weeks.''
   Big oil companies say they are not to blame for any
price-gouging at the pump, because they can't control what gas
stations choose to charge.
   ``There have been quite clear indications that the price of
gasoline has not gone up quite as rapidly as crude oil,'' said Gus
Ensz, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the leading
industry group. ``Some of the marketers have been saying they have
not been making what they should be making.
   ``If that's the case, it might not be surprising if they wait a
little before they try to cut their prices,'' Ensz said from API's
headquarters in Washington.
   Critics nonetheless contend that oil compnnies are taking
advantage of consumers.
   At Buyers Up, a Ralph Nader consumers group in Washington,
research director Christopher Dyson said home heating oil prices
have remained virtually unchanged after oil took its big fall.
   ``Prices have gone down 1 cent a gallon, here in the greater
Washington area, even though crude oil prices have gone down about
$10 a barrel so far,'' Dyson said. ``It may drop more, but they're
taking their time. A lot of it is just sort of gouging. Prices
should fall more than a penny after a $10 drop.''
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., calls the recent high oil
prices ``a theft of billions of dollars from workers and businesses
across the country.''
   Lieberman has organized a series of Senate Government Affairs
Committee hearings into oil pricing that will begin Thursday in
Washington. He hopes to outlaw price-gouging during times of
national economic emergencies.
   The industry believes investigations into pricing will shoot
down any allegations of gouging.
   ``The testimony will demonstrate that a free market has been at
work,'' Ensz said.

<HEAD>United: Airline Furthering Its `Strategic Plan' with Route
Purchase</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-UAL-Pan Am, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freed from years of takeover offers, United
Airlines is now moving ahead with its long-term strategy and
focusing attention on its position in the changing industry.
   United's agreement to buy some of Pan Am's trans-Atlantic routes
followed an announcement in early October that United parent UAL
Corp. had rejected an employee buyout bid. The takeover proposal
was the latest of four offered directors in as many years.
   On Oct. 16 United announced it was planning what could become
the largest wide-body aircraft purchase in history - $22 billion
worth of planes. The company said it also had won authorization to
fly the coveted non-stop Chicago-Tokyo route.
   Two days later, UAL announced it had made peace with its largest
shareholder, Coniston Partners. Coniston had threatened to oust
directors unless a union-led buyout was approved. UAL agreed to add
two officials from the New York investment firm to its 13-member
board, and Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said then that by putting the
uncertainty over ownership behind, the company could focus fully on
the airline's long-term plans and opportunities.
   The agreement announced Tuesday with Pan Am marks a major
expansion by UAL. It bought Pan Am's prized Pacific routes five
years ago for $750 million and has since become a key airline in
that part of the world.
   ``This announcement culminates a series of major events over the
past nine days furthering United's strategic plan,'' United said in
a statement.
   Earlier this year United became the biggest carrier across the
Pacific Ocean, suprpassing Japan Air Lines and Northwest Airlines.
   Pacific travel now accounts for 24 percent of United's business.
The Pacific expansion has given United a slight edge over
arch-rival American Airlines in monthly revenue passenger miles
since June.

<HEAD>New ABA Head Takes Over at Difficult Time for Banking Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard A. Kirk once donned a Star Trek
costume and played the part of Capt. Kirk to lead a chamber of
commerce campaign in his hometown of Denver.
   As the new president of the American Bankers Association, he is
walking into a situation that may make him wish he was in another
universe.
   Kirk, who was installed as ABA president Tuesday, becomes the
chief spokesman for an industry that is suffering from a weakened
economy, losses by some of its most hallowed institutions, eroding
consumer confidence and the likelihood of tougher government
regulation.
   ``I think it's going to be a particularly challenging year,''
Kirk said in an interview at the ABA's annual convention, a
five-day affair that concludes today.
   Kirk, chairman of the United Bank of Denver, said one of his
main tasks is to take steps to restore confidence in the banking
industry.
   He maintains that the industry is fundamentally sound, and its
problems have been exaggerated in the public eye since the banks
having serious problems include some of the nation's most
well-known institutions.
   Kirk said the banks also have been unfairly tainted by the
savings and loan crisis.
   ``My primary agenda item is to work on confidence in banking.
It's an area I feel strongly about.''
   Kirk is annoyed by the suggestion that banks are going through
one of the worst times in the industry's history, an opinion that
has been frequently aired in the media in the wake of third quarter
earnings reports that showed losses for many banks and sharply
declining profit levels for others.
   ``That is clearly incorrect,'' he said. ``Banks may have been in
worse shape in 1985 . . . there were more failures, agriculture was
having problems.''
   He said his home state is an example of an area that is now
showing economic improvement.
   ``We had an eight year recession in Colorado. Denver is now on a
rebound'' Kirk said. ``The Southeast and the Northeast are having
problems. They can be dealt with.''
   With the national economy teetering on the brink of a recession
- or, as some economists say, already there - Kirk said confidence
in the banking system is imperative.
   ``It appears to me when the public reads in the newspapers about
the real estate bust, about the problems large banks are having, it
starts to raise questions: what's my bank like? That's a very
serious situation,'' Kirk said.
   ``I don't think it's healthy for the nation to worry about their
banks being in good condition.''
   Kirk's Star Trek get-up came in 1987 for a Greater Denver
Chamber of Commerce membership drive. He said he doesn't plan any
such gimmicks for the ABA, though he wants to spread the word that
the industry is healthy.
   Kirk said he hopes ABA members will spread that message in their
own communities.
   Kirk said banks are in far better shape than the savings and
loan industry. Banks, he said, have more capital, better regulation
and stronger insurance.
   ``It's very important for us to keep people aware of those
differences,'' he said.
   The federal government wants banks to increase their capital as
a cushion against bad loans. That is just one of several regulatory
areas apt to be changed on Kirk's watch at the ABA.
   Kirk, whose association has one of the nation's most powerful
political action committees, said he's unfazed by the prospects.
   ``It's almost a sure bet we will get some significant banking
changes in Congress next year, maybe earlier,'' he said. ``We're
well positioned to deal with these issues.''

<HEAD>Ex-Drexel Chief Testifies Against Former Junk Bond Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief
Frederick Joseph testified against the man who led the firm to Wall
Street stardom as the government finished the second phase of its
pre-sentencing case against Michael Milken.
   Also Tuesday, the former president of an important Drexel
junk-bond customer said Milken offered him a personal investment in
a 1985 takeover after his company bought a large stake in the deal.
   The testimony by Richard Grassgreen was important because it was
the first indication Milken may have directly given big clients
equity in the leverage buyout of Storer Communications Inc.
   Taking the stand nearly four years after Drexel and Milken were
linked to wrongdoing in the government's insider trading probe,
Joseph said Milken may have violated company policies related to
Storer investments and misled him.
   Government charges against Milken are being aired at a
pre-sentencing hearing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood.
Prosecutors claim Milken broke the law beyond criminal charges to
which he has pleaded guilty and deserves a lengthy prison term.
   The hearing is to resume Thursday with testimony on the last of
three alleged illegal transactions, involving trading in Caesar's
World Inc. securities in 1983. A sentencing date has not been set.
   Grassgreen, formerly president of Kinder-Care Inc., testified as
part of his own agreement to plead guilty to two felony charges
related to pocketing up to $500,000 from investments made by his
company.
   Tuesday's testimony focused on the $2.5 billion buyout of Storer
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., for which Drexel provided
financing in late 1985.
   Prosecutors claim Milken misappropriated valuable Storer equity
warrants, or rights to purchase Storer stock, and used them to lure
customers into buying riskier Storer securities.
   Under questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll,
Grassgreen said that after committing Kinder-Care to buying $5
million in preferred stock in Storer he was told by a Drexel
executive about the warrants.
   When Grassgreen asked whether Kinder-Care could buy some of the
warrants, he said Milken told him, ``No, it's for you and Perry,''
referring to Kinder-Care chairman Perry Mendel.
   Grassgreen testified he believed he was offered the warrants
because of his longstanding relationship with Drexel and the
company's role in the Storer deal.
   But Grassgreen contradicted testimony last week by Drexel
executive Thomas Connors. Also, none of six government witnesses on
Storer directly backed the bribery charge against Milken.
   Grassgreen said under cross-examination by defense lawyer Arthur
Liman that Milken was unaware of Grassgreen's lawbreaking and that
all investments made with Drexel in a relationship dating to 1978
were based on merit.
   Grassgreen has agreed to plead guilty to pocketing commitment
fees paid by Drexel to Kinder-Care for investing in four takeover
deals and to failing to disclose his personal stake in Storer to
his company. He resigned last week as president of Montgomery,
Ala.-based Enstar Group Inc., Kinder-Care's successor.
   Milken, 44, pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to
illegal trading and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties. He
faces a maximum 28 years imprisonment.
   Joseph testified under Drexel's agreement to cooperate with the
government in settling criminal charges last year. Drexel now is in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   He said he did not learn about a Drexel-related investment
partnership known as MacPherson Investment Partners that was formed
out of the Storer deal until 1988.
   MacPherson consisted of Drexel clients, money fund managers,
Drexel employees and a trust in the name of the children of both
Milken and his brother, Lowell, who also worked for Drexel.
   Joseph said the stake for the trust for the Milkens' children
should have been disclosed to executives of the firm because of
Drexel's role in creating and trading the securities. Disclosure
was required to ensure the investment complied with federal and
firm rules.
   Joseph said he believed the decision to give partnership stakes
to fund managers whose institutions bought risky Storer securities
also violated Drexel guidelines against giving ``favorable
treatment'' to institutional investor accounts.
   Joseph also said that he asked Milken in the fall of 1988
whether any fund managers had invested in Drexel partnerships and
Milken said no.
   Under cross-examination, Joseph said that Drexel employee
partnerships had taken equity stakes in other leveraged buyout
deals.
   Joseph also conceded that Milken was not responsible for
determining whether investments needed to be disclosed and that
Milken routinely consulted Drexel executives about personal
investments.

<HEAD>American Airlines Plans To Expand San Juan Hub Despite Shaky Times</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-UAL-Pan Am, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVAN RAMSTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines is planning expansions of its
hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and some other Caribbean operations
despite economic conditions that have left its 1990 performance
shaky.
   ``Even in the worst of times, there are opportunities to be
found out there,'' American chief executive Robert Crandall said as
he announced the $100 million expansion Tuesday.
   ``The Caribbean has been strong for us in good and bad times,''
he said.
   Over the next four years, American plans to add 10 gates for a
total of 25 at Luis Munos Marin International Airport and a customs
facility capable of processing 5,000 passengers an hour.
   Its terminal area will total more than 1 million square feet
when the expansion is done, up from 260,000 square feet.
   A looming recession and higher jet fuel prices are likely to
dent American's 1990 earnings, Crandall said last week when the
company's third quarter profit drop of 52 percent was announced.
   Unless fuel prices decrease significantly, Crandall warned, a
fourth-quarter loss was almost assured and could be large enough to
wipe out the company's $175.5 million profit in the first three
quarters.
   But American's vice president for the Caribbean, Peter Dolara,
said air traffic in that region will likely remain strong even if
it slows in the continental United States.
   The demand for air travel is less elastic in the Caribbean
because a large share of passengers live in the region and are
flying to visit friends and relatives on other islands, Dolara
said. Few of them have other travel options besides flying, he
said.
   In addition, continental U.S. passengers who vacation in Europe
typically turn to the Caribbean as a less costly alternative during
a recession, Dolara said.
   Lee Howard, chief executive officer of Airline Economics Inc.,
said American is one of the few carriers that can make a
substantial capital commitment, such as the San Juan expansion, in
a recession and fuel crisis.
   ``American will emerge probably a relatively stronger carrier
because some of the weaker ones will have gone by the wayside in
the same time frame,'' Howard said.
   United Airlines, which jockeys with American as the nation's
largest carrier, also made a major capital commitment Tuesday.
United will spend $400 million to purchase most of Pan Am's routes
between the United States and London.
   American began service in 1986 to the Caribbean and the region
now accounts for about 12 percent of its routes and slightly more
than 12 percent of its revenues, Crandall said.
   When new route additions are completed in December, American
will have 58 daily flights to 26 destinations from San Juan.
American Eagle, its regional affiliate, will have 68 daily flights
to 15 destinations.
   The airline eventually may operate 200 flights daily in San
Juan, Crandall said.
   In addition to the terminal improvements in San Juan, American
will also help pay for a roadway expansion and new control tower at
the airport. The company plans smaller capital improvements at St.
Thomas, Santo Domingo, St. Croix, St. Maarten, Puerto Plata,
Montego Bay and Kingston.
   The airline recently opened a $10 million reservations office in
San Juan that eventually will employ 200 people.

<HEAD>Canadians Blurt Out The Bad News - Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadians abhor being seen as following in
American footsteps, and this time they got out in front by
officially tumbling into recession on their own. The United States,
however, may nt be far behind.
   Finance Minister Michal Wilson, after weeks of dodging the dread
``R'' word, finally acknowledged to a House of Commons committee
Monday night that Canada had slipped into a recession, though he
expected it to be short.
   The country's largest bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, also
predicted negative growth for the third and fourth quarters of this
year, saying a slow recovery would begin next year.
   Wilson said the current recession would be nothing like the
1981-82 version, which involved a precipitous drop into a ``black
hole.''
   ``The partial information that is now available for the third
quarter, together with some major work stoppages, the crisis in the
Middle East and the weakening U.S. economy, suggest a further
decline in output,'' Wilson said. ``However, we do not expect this
to be a severe recession.''
   Dr. Edward Neufeld, chief economist at the Royal Bank, said the
current situation differed from the 1981-82 recession in that the
economy since 1988 has slipped slowly into economic malaise and
will work its way out slowly.
   Neufeld said the Canadian economy has never gone into recession
when the American economy did not ``no matter how far back you want
to look.''
   Some economists says the U.S. economy already is in recession,
others say it will hit recession in the fourth quarter of this
year, and still others predict the United States will escape
recession by a narrow margin.
   The opposition in the Canadian Parliament has blamed the
conservative government's policy of high interest rates - an effort
to cure inflation - for the recession.
   Recession usually is defined as two consecutive quarters of
negative growth. The Canadian economy shrank 0.4 percent in the
second quarter of 1990 and Wilson predicted there would be
negligible growth for four quarters.
   ``Consumers will be looking over the next year or so at no
increase in their standard of living,'' Neufeld told a group of
reporters at an economic briefing.
   He said it would be a period when consumers pay ``tremendous
attention to managing their financial affairs,'' and a time to
focus on ``keeping your job if you have a good one.''
   Canadians seem to have the word already. Retail sales in August
were down 0.2 percent from July as consumers spent less on
big-ticket items such as vehicles, furniture and appliances,
according to Statistics Canada, the government's number crunchers.
   The Royal Bank's forecast said unemployment probably would rise
from the current 8.4 percent to about 9 percent at the peak of the
downturn.
   Statistics Canada figures showed a drop in the composite leading
indicator for the sixth straight month. Corporate profits have
plunged 23 percent below a year ago, and personal bankruptcies are
37 percent above 1989.
   Canadian inflation has dropped from 5.5 percent in January to
4.1 percent in August, but that at the cost of extremely high
interest rates. The rates have been edging down a bit recently. The
prime lending rate has gone from 14.75 percent to 13.75 percent.
   Various business groups have been pleading with Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney's government to get a handle on the deficit.
   The latest plea came this week from the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association which has created a new ``competitiveness index''
measuring labor productivity, wholesale prices and exports.
   Laurent Thibault, president of the association, said much of the
prosperity of the 1980s ``has been built on an accumulated mountain
of debt.''
   The last Canadian budget forecast a deficit of $24.2 billion
(U.S.) for the 1990-91 fiscal year. Wilson said recently it will be
$850 million to $1.3 billion higher than that.
   ``The majo  policy issue in the United States and Canada is the
fiscal deficit,'' said the Royal Bank's Neufeld. In addition to
that, ``We are building up a load of debt to foreigners that is
finally becoming uncontainable.''
   The government and the country' biggest bank agree the present
slowdown is the price to pay for a decade of prosperity and that
the shallow economic dip should be over by the end of 1991.
   All the predictions, however, assume there will be no shooting
war in the Middle East.
   ``A disruption of Middle East oil flows would have a devastating
effect on the economy and you could forget all my forecasts,'' said
Neufeld.

<HEAD>Southland Files For Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN L. ARTERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp. filed early today for protection
from its creditors along with a reorganization plan that would
clear the way for selling control of the nation's largest
convenience store operator to a Japanese group.
   The parent of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain said its debt
and preffered stock holders have approved the so-called prepackaged
reorganization plan which is being submitted for confirmation by
the federal bankruptcy court.
   The company has been trying to avoid filing for protection under
Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since March, when it announced it
would sell a majority stake to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd. and Seven-Eleven
Japan Co. Ltd., its Japanese franchisees.
   The Japanese investors would provide $430 million in new cash in
exchange for a 70 percent stake in common stock in the reorganized
company.
   The restructuring would leave the creditors with far less than
they loaned the firm in 1987 when the founding Thompson family took
the company private.
   Dallas-based Southland has struggled under the debt incurred in
the $4.9 billion leveraged buyout. The company also faces
increasing competition from proliferating convenience stores run by
major oil companies.
   The company said today that a syndicate of lenders has agreed to
provide Southland up to $400 million in debtor-in-possession
financing.
   Southland spokeswoman Cecilia Stubbs Norwood said the company
intends to use the funds as working capital to purchase necessary
inventories and to continue the company's other normal operating
activities.
   The company said that of those security holders voting on the
prepackaged reorganization plan, about 89 percent of the
outstanding principal amount of debt securities and approximately
90 percent of the outstanding shares of preferred stock were voted
in favor of the plan.
   Southland has asked for a bankruptcy court hearing on Dec. 10
for the confirmation of the prepackaged reorganization plan.
   Ms. Norwood said the proposed prepackaged bankruptcy plan
consists of two parts - exchange offers and a cash infusion by the
Japanese partners.
   Under the exchange offers, existing shareholders - primarily the
Thompson family - would retain a 5 percent equity position.
Bondholders would receive 25 percent of the common stock and the
Japanese would purchase 70 percent of the company's common stock,
she said.
   Creditors reportedly like the bankruptcy plan because they
believe it could bring a quick resolution to their uncertainty.
Companies have begun using such prepackaged plans to shorten the
time it takes for them to emerge from bankruptcy.
   The company also said it is immediately filing motions in
bankruptcy court to seek approval to assume existing 7-Eleven
franchises and area licensee agreements; pay employee salaries and
wages and continue existing employee benefit plans and pay
pre-petition debt in full to all suppliers who agree to provide the
company with customary credit terms during the bankruptcy case.
   ``In the light of the results of the exchange offers and the
high level of support we have received for our prepackaged
reorganization plan, we believe this is the best alternative to
complete a financial restructuring quickly,'' said Clark Matthews,
Southland's chief financial officer. ``We hope to obtain court
approval of the prepackaged reorganization plan as soon as
possible.''
   ``Upon confirmation of our plan and consummation of our new
Stock Purchase Agreement, we will go forward with a more manageable
debt load, as well as the capital we need to remain at the top of
the competitive convenience retailing industry,'' Matthews added.
   Members of the Thompson family were not available for comment,
Ms. Norwood said.
   Southland operates about 6,800 7-Eleven stores and other
convenience outlets in the United States and Canada, with another
6,000 stores in the United States and 21 other countries run by
licensees, of which Seven-Eleven Japan is the largest.

   United Auto Workers union negotiators bargaining
with Chrysler Corp. were pleased to learn that Canadian Auto
Workers union officials think a contract with Chrysler's Canadian
subsidiary may be near.
   The UAW and the Canadian Auto Workers are pressing Chrysler and
its Chrysler Canada Ltd. subsidiary to agree to contracts mirroring
agreements already reached with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and their Canadian operations.
   Chrysler and its Canadian subsidiary have hinted they may not be
able to agree to a pattern agreement ratified by GM and Ford
workers.
   On Monday, Chrysler Canada gave the CAW an economic proposal CAW
President Bob White called ``a great relief.'' The CAW has set a
midnight Thursday deadline.
   Analysts said the proposal from Chrysler Canada may signal that
the parent corporation is more willing to go along with the UAW
pattern agreement than it had indicated. The CAW represents about
10,000 Chrysler workers in Canada.
   On Tuesday, a UAW official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said, ``I didn't see any long faces around here'' after
White's remarks.
   Company spokesman Lee Sechler declined to say Tuesday if
negotiators had made headway in the talks.
   The UAW has set no deadline for its talks with Chrysler. The
union represents about 63,000 active Chrysler workers in the United
States.
   The Detroit Free Press today quoted unidentified union officials
as saying that a Monday strike deadline could be set today.
   Meantime, The Detroit News reported today UAW President Owen
Bieber told union bargainers he's hoping for a settlement by the
first of next week. The News said neither Bieber nor UAW Vice
President Stan Marshall, in charge of the union's Chrysler
Department, said anything about setting a strike deadline.
   Bieber set up shop Monday morning at Chrysler's headquarters in
the Detroit enclave of Highland Park. He met with Chrysler Vice
President Anthony St. John, said the UAW source.
   There have been no formal sessions at the main negotiating
table, company and union officials said, as negotiators have been
bargaining in subcommittees that focus on specific provisions in a
contract.
   Chrysler and its Canadian subsidiary have said for months that
meeting the pattern agreement reached with the other two automakers
would be difficult.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and other executives, while
falling short of demanding concessions, have said the struggling
company needs special consideration.
   Chrysler is expected next week to report a third-quarter loss
that may wipe out the $251 million it earned in the first six
months of this year.

<HEAD>Former CBOT Chief Mahlmann Takes Job In London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten
Mahlmann is going to England as chief of the London office of the
Rosenthal-Collins Group, a Chicago-based futures brokerage.
   Mahlmann resigned as leader of the world's largest commodities
exchange in August amid problems at Stotler &amp; Co., the now-defunct
brokerage he headed.
   Rosenthal-Collins is run by Leslie Rosenthal, a political
opponent of Mahlmann who opposed him in last year's exchange
chairmanship election.
   Rosenthal and Mahlmann said Monday that their political
differences have never interfered with their friendship.
   ``The poor guy's been punished enough,'' Rosenthal said. ``His
life savings were tied up in a firm that went down the drain. At
53, he's starting over again.''
   Rosenthal said he believes Mahlmann's assertion that he had
nothing to do with the problems at Stotler, which collapsed due to
a lack of cash.
   Mahlmann has not been accused of wrongdoing by federal
regulators in a lawsuit that charges a Stotler affiliate defrauded
investors.
   Mahlmann's successor at the Board of Trade, William F. O'Connor,
announced Monday he will seek re-election as chairman in the Dec.

   The stock market declined slightly today,
continuing the indecisive pattern that has prevailed since the
start of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 8.17 to 2,485.89
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 329 up, 580 down and
464 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.79 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   As the business day began the price of crude oil for December
delivery climbed nearly $1 a barrel, to more than $30 a barrel, on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts said that helped to put a damper on buying interest in
the stock market, along with persistent worries about the economic
outlook.
   The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders for
durable goods dropped 1.7 percent in September, on top of a
downward-revised decline of 0.8 percent in August.
   The latest decrease stemmed mainly from a drop in transportation
orders, which are often subject to wide short-term fluctuations.
But brokers said it still came as something of an unpleasant
surprise to investors.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down | at
53&rsqb;; Philip Morris, down \ at 47}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .43 to 170.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .71 at 292.26.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.03 to
2,494.06.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
821 up, 695 down and 455 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.30 million

<HEAD>Reports 5 Percent Decline in Third-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norfolk Southern Corp. said Wednesday its
third quarter earnings declined 5 percent from a year ago, citing
increased diesel fuel costs and expenses related to a stock
buyback.
   Net income for the third quarter was $142.9 million, or 89 cents
a share, in the third quarter compared to $150.5 million, or 87
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Arnold B. McKinnon, chairman, president and chief executive,
said income from operations rose 6.5 percent depite a 24.7 percent
in diesel fuel costs due to price increases.
   He said other income fell 53.7 percent because of a combination
of investment-related transactions and increased interest expenses
on debt incurred to finance the stock repurchase program.
   Revenue rose 2.9 percent to $1.18 billion in the quarter from
$1.14 billion a year earlier.
   Coal revenue rose 9.8 percent while general merchandise revenue
was essentially flat.
   Net income for the first nine months of 1990 was $439 million,
or $2.68 a share, down 4.1 percent from $458 million, or $2.61 a
share, in the first nine months of 1989.
   Nine-month revenue rose 1.9 percent to $3.49 billion from $3.43
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Former Bankers Arrested in Tax Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former bank employees and two customers have
been arrested on charges of evading millions of dollars in income
taxes on profits made in an alleged stock manipulation scheme,
prosecutors said Wednesday.
   It was the second set of arrests involving major Japanese
finaniial institutions in connection with stock manipulation linked
to Koshin, a group under investigation for the last two years.
   A former Sumitomo Bank branch manager was arrested earlier this
month for allegedly providing illegal loans to the group. Two top
bank executives resigned over the case, and the bank ordered
six-month salary cuts of up to 50 percent for a dozen other
executives.
   Arrested Wednesday were Tsunetaka Seto, 48, a former branch
manager of Mitsui Trust and Banking Co.; Haruki Matsuo, 40, one of
his staffers, and two of their customers - Nobuyuki Ito, 43, a
licensed tax accountant, and Taisuke Kobayashi, 52, a business
executive, the Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office said.
   The prosecutor's office said the four failed to report a total
of more than $23.4 million in income between 1986 and 1988, evading
$14.1 million in taxes.
   It said it raided some 10 sites, including residences of the
four.
   Prosecutors said the four opened disguised accounts under
relatives' names for transactions in manipulated stocks, such as
those of Tobishima Corp. and Kokusai Kogyo Co.
   Local news reports said the four acquired insider stock trading
information from Mitsuhiro Kotani, the Koshin group's leader.
Kotani was charged earlier this year with manipulating share
prices.
   Mitsui Trust spokesman Kazuo Shibui told a news conference after
the arrests Wednesday: ``We see this case as a result of their
personal activities, which have nothing to do with our company.''
   But he said the arrest of former bank employees was ``extremely
regrettable for a financial institution'' and added, ``We apologize
for the fact that we caused trouble to the public.''
   Shibui said the bank had fired Seto in April 1988 and Matsuo in
February 1990 following an internal investigation, and demoted two
branch managers.
   He said Mitsui Trust cut the salaries of 12 top executives by
10-20 percent between May and August.

   Wheat and corn futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
speculation the Soviet Union wants to import more grain. Soybean
futures were mostly lower.
   The expectations of new grain sales to Moscow stem in part from
reports the Soviet Union has chartered freight vessels that now are
situated off the U.S., Canadian and Argentine coasts, said William
Biedermann, director of research with the commodities brokerage
Allendale Inc.
   He said there was talk in the markets that the Soviets were
considering buying 600,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   Soybeans edged lower in quiet trading inspired more by technical
factors than supply-and-demand fundamentals, Biedermann said.

<HEAD>Goodyear Reports Loss; Will Trim Payroll By 3,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. today said it
planned to cut 3,000 jobs by mid-1992 as part of a restructuring,
spurred on by a depressed tire market and a $61.4 million loss in
the third quarter.
   Goodyear's loss amounted to $1.06 per share in the third
quarter.
   In September, the company warned various factors would lead to a
loss for the quarter.
   Goodyear earned $70.5 million, or $1.22 per share, in the 1989
third quarter.
   The loss reflected $51.7 million, or 89 cents per share, in
unusual charges for restructuring. The costs resulted from
realignment of European tire marketing; phase-out of medium and
heavy truck tire production in Quebec; $22.2 million in
environmental cleanup costs; and depreciation of the All American
Pipeline System.
   About 3,000 jobs will be cut to reduce Goodyear's worldwide
staff to 106,000 by mid-1992 as part of the restructuring, Chairman
Tom H. Barrett said in a message to shareholders.
   The company also blamed the loss on increased selling,
administrative and general expenses; severe competitive pricing in
the tire replacement market; reduced auto and truck production, and
production cutbacks to reduce inventories.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 8.2 percent to $2.9 billion from
$2.68 billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Goodyear reported a loss of
$49.9 million, or 86 cents per share. The company earned $192.1
million, or $3.33 per share, during the first nine months the
previous years.
   Worldwide sales rose 4 percent in the first nine months to $8.46
billion from $8.13 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Earnings Plunge 30 Percent In Third Straight Quarterly Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today reported a 30
percent drop in third-quarter ear straight
quarterly decline in nings, the thirdprofits for the retailing and financial
services giant.
   Sears blamed the weak third-quarter performance mainly on lower
gains from property sales in its Coldwell Banker real estate
subsidiary.
   The company's struggling retailing division posted a 7.6 percent
gain in the third quarter after suffering a decline in the second
quarter and a loss in the first.
   Chicago-based Sears reported overall earnings of $179.2 million,
or 53 cents a share, for the three months ending Sept. 30 compared
with $257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year
ago.
   Total revenues rose 5.9 percent to $13.96 billion from $13.18
billion in the third quarter of 1989.
   Coldwell Banker's operating income fell tlittle
sense because the poor don't have any money. If they had money,
they wouldn't be poor.
   Republicans who cry out against ``class warfare'' are not
against class warfare when it involves the middle class being
forced by law to subsidize the rich. They oppose warfare (or even
unpleasantness) against their own class because it might result in
losing a few bucks.
   Raising the income tax will not remove the motivation to be
rich. As Sophie Tucker put it, ``rich is better,'' no matter what
the tax rate. The worst thing higher upper-bracket taxes might do
is convince financial wheeler-dealers and lawyers to work a little
less hard, a blessing to every life form on this planet. ...
   Interest on the national debt is the fastest growing
``entitlement program'' in the budget. It is money we bale up and
ship off to international bankers to pay for the phony prosperity
of the days when it was ``morning in America.''
   If we don't do something soon, there won't be any arguments over
guns vs. butter. There will be none of either. Our money will go
straight to our creditors, like a family with 100 credit cards, all
past due.

   Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on the budget:
   President Bush personally and members of Congress collectively
are losing the confidence of the nation as they drag out their
feuding and quarrelling over a deficit-reducing budget.
   The Democrats say tax the rich. The Republicans say cut federal
expenditures.
   We would go with the Republicans, but both may be a little
right. The nation's wealthiest taxpayers are being taxed at a much
smaller percent of their total incomes than they were a decade ago.
Meanwhile, as Congress debates, the federal deficit continues to
rise. Interest rates remain high. And this massive federal
borrowing is depleting the economic vigor of America.
   Why not cut the military? The Cold War is over. The Soviet
Union, with its failing economy, is in far worst shape than the
United States. The Soviets obviously are not bent on military
confrontation with the West.
   Why more than 300,000 U.S. troops in Germany? World War II has
been over for 45 years. Germany, an economic powerhouse, has
reunited. The Soviet Union intends to withdraw its troops from what
used to be East Germany and the Germans are going to pay for the
withdrawal. Moreover, while Europe was exhausted and in ruins after
World War II, today Europe is stronger than ever. Through the
European Community the nations of Europe are prospering. So why are
U.S. troops needed to protect a dynamic Europe?
   It is true the military operation in the Persian Gulf will
require a substantial expenditure so long as it lasts. We are still
assuming, however, that this is not a permanent military
commitment, that it will be worked out in time and the U.S. troops
will come home.
   ---
   Oct. 18
   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on the budget:
   As U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., points out, this budget
crisis didn't happen overnight. The executive and legislative
branches have ignored a growing deficit for more than a decade, and
now facing the catastrophic results of Gramm-Rudman, they snivel
and bicker.
   Bradley estimates that we could easily cut $250 million from
defense spending over the next five years and still maintain a
strong military in a regional crisis like the Persian Gulf.
   But Congress resists. The House has delayed by two years Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's proposal to shut down 35 bases in the U.S.
and 12 overseas. The move affects more Democratic districts than
Republican and thus parochial House representatives undermine the
deficit reduction process.
   Over the next few days, the president and Congress must discard
hidden agendas, special interests and partisan politics. They have
a job to do, and America tires of their stall tactics.

   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on inflation:
   Inflation is a lot like flu. Even when it's not around, there's
a feeling that it's lurking somewhere, just waiting for an
opportunity to strike again.
   For two months now the cost of living has risen sharply. If the
situation worsens we could return to the days of double-digit
inflation.
   Usually inflation can be blamed on a number of factors. But its
recent upsurge could largely be attributed to one single villain -
Saddam Hussein. The inflation spurt was caused largely by the jump
in the price of oil, which was precipitated by Saddam's invasion of
Kuwait.
   The future does not look promising. Still, we have blundered our
way through other messes. The U.S. economy is under siege, but it
is still a very tough customer. At this point, we can still keep
our fingers crossed and hope for the best.

<HEAD>Beating The High Cost of Delivering: Magazines Doing it Themselves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magazine publishers say they've found a way to
beat the high cost of delivering: They're doing it themselves.
   A few small alternative magazine delivery systems have popped up
over the last few years, but now one of the industry's heavy
hitters - Time Warner Inc. - has entered the picture.
   The publishing industry says if Time's system prospers, more
companies could follow and eventually provide significant
competition for the U.S. Postal Service.
   ``There's no question what the motivation here is,'' said George
Gross, an executive vice president of the trade group Magazine
Publishers of America. ``By building a distribution system you are
saying to the Postal Service that while there is no alternative
now, in time there will be.''
   The magazine industry has been complaining for year that rising
postal rates have been cutting into their profits. Postmaster
General Anthony Frank has acknowledged that postal rates have
increased beyond general inflation, and he has vowed to slow the
pace.
   But the Postal Service maintains it can do a better job of
delivery than alternative systems such as Publishers Express, for
which Time Warner is the managing partner. Eight other equity
partners are involved in the project.
   Begun in Atlanta last year on a trial basis, Publishers Express
now is delivering more than 100,000 magazines, catalogs and
advertisement packages a month to more than 80,000 households
within five ZIP codes. The company has set a goal of 200,000 pieces
a month to 100,000 households by the end of the year.
   From a suburban Atlanta facility, delivery crews sort 24 titles
- including Time, Sports Illustrated, TV Guide, the Atlantic
Monthly and Playboy - and deliver them in sealed packages before
dawn each day.
   Publishers Express cannot use mailboxes under federal law. The
magazines and catalogs are delivered to doorsteps or left at the
base of a mailbox.
   ``If you look at the magazine business, distribution is the only
cost we don't have control over,'' said Howard Rosen, president of
Publishers Express. ``But it's very tough to tell the post office
you don't like their pricing structure. They'd say, `Fine, but
you've got nowhere else to go.' ''
   Since 1970, Rosen said, the cost for second class postage -
which is the rate for newspapers and magazines - has risen 811
percent compared to a general inflation rate of 209 percent over
that time. Third class postage - the rate for most catalogs - has
gone up 364 percent, he said.
   The Postal Service puts the figures a bit lower: 767 percent for
second class and 247 percent for third class.
   Nonetheless, Rosen said, ``It's too cost prohibitive to
distribute our products through the post office.''
   In addition to titles published by Time Warner, the distribution
service has contracted with other magazines and catalogs to deliver
their products, Rosen said. The titles in the designated ZIP code
areas are automatically distributed through Publishers Express,
though consumers may request that the Postal Service take over
their service.
   Postal Service spokesman Bob Hoobing said costs may be higher
but service is reliable.
   ``The fact of the matter is, we have people who are career
workers delivering the mail. We think we're more reliable,'' he
said.
   Hoobing declined to speculate on the impact of such alternative
delivery services. He said about 6.5 percent of the 161.6 billion
pieces of mail handled last year by the Postal Service was second
class.
   If future postal rate increases continue to pinch, ``there will
be more magazines saying (to Time) we want to join you,'' said
Gross, of the Magazine Publishers of America.
   Kofie Q. Dadzie, an assistant marketing professor at Georgia
State University who specializes in distribution systems, said an
operation such as Time's would have to handle an enormous amount of
material to make its costs competitive with the post office.
   ``I'd be interested in finding the cost analysis that said it
would be cheaper,'' Dadzie said. ``I'm surprised.''
   Rosen declined to disclose Publishers Express' income, but he
acknowledged the distribution system must expand if it is to do the
job of the post office at a lower cost.
   ``Clearly at the scale we're at, we are not in a competitive
price situation with the post office,'' he said. ``We need to
double our volume. It can be reached within the next year or
two.''

   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Wednesday its
first quarter earnings slipped 1.6 percent from results a year ago
that included a big settlement in a legal fight over a cookie
patent.
   The consumer products giant earned $555 million, or $1.57 a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with $564
million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier.
   Procter &amp; Gamble won the $125 million settlement - $81 million
after taxes - from a lawsuit it filed alleging that competitors
Frito-Lay, Nabisco and Keebler had infringed on P&amp;G's patent for
Duncan Hines ready-to-serve cookies.
   Excluding the settlement, earnings for the July-September period
in 1989 were $483 million, or $1.36 a share.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it had $6.65 billion in first quarter
sales worldwide, up 16.3 percent from $5.7 million a year earlier.
   Chairman Edwin L. Artzt said he was pleased that unit volume and
earnings excluding the settlement have ``continued to grow at a
dopuble-digit pace despite the uncertain times in which we are
operating.''
   The company said it had restated its July-September 1989
financial results to include operations of Noxell Corp., the
personal-care products maker based in Hunt Valley, Md., which P&amp;G
absorbed in November 1989.

   Sales rose 5.9 percent to $830.8 million from $785.1 million in
the same quarter of 1989.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Avon's profit rose 34 percent
to $107.3 million, $1.42 a share, compared with $80.3 million, 97
cents a share, a year ago. Nine-month sales jumped 3 percent to
$2.33 billion from $2.27 billion in 1989.
   ``Our strong third quarter reflects continued profit
improvements in the U.S. and the Americas, continued reduction in
interest expense and a lower tax rate,'' said James E. President,
president and chief executive officer of the New York-based
company.
   Third-quarter sales in the company's international unit jumped 8
percent while those for Avon's domestic unit rose 2 percent.
   The company cut its debt during the quarter to $603.3 million,
down from $1.09 billion at the same time last year and $838.1
million at the end of 1989.
   Avon is trying to sell half of its 60 percent interest in its
Japanese subsidiary and should know soon if the transaction can be
completed this year, Preston said.

<HEAD>Du Pont Reports Drop in Third Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Du Pont Co. on Wednesday reported a
3 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, with increases in its
petroleum operations offset by slower growth in the company's
chemicals businesses.
   The company reported net earnings of $533 million in the quarter
ended Sept. 30, down from $547 million last year. Earnings per
share were flat at 79 cents, and reflected a lower number of shares
this year due to a buyback program.
   Sales for the quarter were up 16 percent at $9.9 billion,
compared with $8.6 billion last year.
   ``Third-quarter results reflect strong performance from our
petroleum operations,'' said Du Pont Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr.
in a statement. ``Petroleum results have benefited from higher
crude oil prices, which will provide a hedge to rising feedstock
costs in our chemical operations.
   ``At the same time, earnings in several of our chemical
businesses continued to be adversely affected by the slowdown in
the U.S. economy,'' Woolard said.
   Du Pont said the improvement in petroleum earnings was due
partly to higher oil prices, which soared after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in early August. The company said 70 percent of the overall
improvement was due to operations overseas, where there was a
strong demand for petroleum products and greater efficiency at the
company's refineries.
   It said higher crude prices also led to an increase in U.S.
earnings, although the company did not fully pass on increased
costs at the gas pump.
   Du Pont also said its quarterly results include gains of 8 cents
a share from the sale of an interest in a North Sea oil property
and an instrument systems business.
   Net income for the first nine months fell 8 percent to $1.8
billion or $2.71 per share, compared with $1.9 billion or $2.82 per
share for the first nine months of 1989.
   Sales for the first nine months were $29 billion, up 9 percent
over $26.5 billion last year.

<HEAD>Greyhound Dial Earnings Up Despite Drop in Revenues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Dial Corp. said Wednesday it increased
its third-quarter earnings despite a drop in revenue, but still
posted a nine-month loss as a result of the bankruptcy of its
former bus line.
   Net income totaled $31.99 million or 80 cents a share on
revenues of $875.93 million for the period ended Sept. 30. That
compares with $30.19 million or 75 cents a share on revenues of
$906.2 million a year earlier, the company said Wednesday.
   For the nine-month period, revenue totaling $2.65 billion
produced $88.04 million in income from continuing operations, or
$2.19 per share. But there was a net loss of $11.96 million or 32
cents a share in the period because of a $100 million after-tax
loss provision taken in the second quarter as a result of the
bankruptcy of Dallas-based Greyhound Bus Lines, the company said.
Greyhound Dial sold the bus company in 1987 but retained an
interest in it.
   The current nine-month figures compare with revenues of $2.67
billion a year earlier, when income from continuing operations and
net earnings were $80.67 million or $2.05 per share.
   John W. Teets, chairman, president and chief executive officer,
said the company's financial group was performing well, with no
major problems in its corporate finance or real estate operations.
   A statement said operating income was up 21 percent in the
consumer products segment, while income rose 7.5 percent in the
services sector.
   Revenue from transportation manufacturing and service dropped
sharply, however, because of a new model start-up problem that
caused ``severe production delays with a major transit bus order,''
the company statement said.

   The stock market eked out some spotty gains
today, continuing the indecisive pattern that has prevailed since
the start of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.87 to 2,506.93
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 709 up, 682 down and 500

   The price of crude oil for December delivery climbed more than
$1.50 a barrel, to the neighborhood of $31 a barrel, on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts said that helped to put a damper on buying interest in
the stock market, along with persistent worries about the economic
outlook.
   The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders for
durable goods dropped 1.7 percent in September, on top of a
downward-revised decline of 0.8 percent in August.
   The latest decrease stemmed mainly from a drop in transportation
orders, which are often subject to wide short-term fluctuations.
But brokers said it still came as something of an unpleasant
surprise to investors.

<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the stock market decline becomes too much
to take, it may be time to look into the future, to dream a bit of
wonderfully bullish times when you can awaken each day to prospects
of profits.
   It has been many months since people enjoyed such days and it
might be a long time before they experience them again. The
economic base that stock prices reflect has serious and maybe
worsening problems.
   Still, history declares that somewhere out in the future are
better times. How far out depends on your sense of time. If you
view a few months as a long time you might be disappointed. If you
think in terms of years you won't be.
   Did you know that even in the decade of the 1930s, when stocks
floundered after the great crash of 1929, the annual loss from
equities was 0.1 percent, barely into the minus column?
   Purists will point out, of course, that much of the collapse
occurred in the final year before the decade of the 1930s, but
historians counter by pointing to another downturn in 1931, and
still another in 1938.
   In no decade since then has the average annual return been a
minus - that is, the total return for the decade broken down to an
annual basis. In each of those decades, however, prices bounced
like a golf ball on a highway.
   In all, there have been 11 bear markets since the 1930s,
including the present one and another that spanned the turn of the
decade from 1939 to the spring of 1942.
   In each one, prices fell sharply - 48 percent in 1973-1974 - but
only one lasted more than three years. That was the 37-month bear
market from May 1946 to June 1949. In each instance, of course,
prices resumed their rise.
   Wright Investors' Service arrived at the 0.1 percent loss for
the 1930s by using this calculation:
   It started with an earned return of minus 0.2 percent a year
from 5.5 percent annual dividend income and a 5.7 percent decline
of earnings. To that was added an increase of 0.1 percent a year in
price-earnings ratios.
   Using the same formula, the return for the 1940s averaged 9.2
percent a year, rose to 19.4 percent in the 1950s, fell back to 7.8
percent in the 1960s and to 5.9 percent in the 1970s, but then
leaped to 17.5 percent in the 1980s.
   You are not convinced by the historical record? Nothing unusual
about that. Such despair is one of the identifying traits of a bear
market, as surely as unjustified optimism identifies a bull market
heading to a disastrous finale.
   Equity investments require faith as well as information. They
are risky, simply because nobody knows anything for certain about
the future, very little about the present and probably only
slightly more than that about the past.
   That said, here are Wright's projections for the period through
1995:
   Dividend income will grow an average of 3.4 percent a year and
earnings 8.1 percent, giving an earned return of 11.5 percent. P-E
ratios, however, will be lowered by 2.6 percent a year, leaving an
annual return of 8.9 percent.
   Based partly on those estimates, Wright projects the Dow Jones
industrials to average 2,750 points in 1991, rising to 2,975 in
1991, to 3,175 in 1993, to 3,413 in 1994 and to 3,625 points in
1995.
   Nothing like the period 1985-1990, when the average almost
doubled from 1,547 points, but a relatively serene sea nonetheless
for those investors who in 1990 saw their stocks engulfed in the
maelstrom.

<HEAD>Earnings Slide Again But Retail Unit Improves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. reported sharply lower net
income Wednesday for the third straight quarter but said its
struggling retail unit has improved under the direct supervision of
Chairman Edward Brennan.
   Overall earnings plunged 30 percent in the third quarter, mainly
due to lower gains by the Coldwell Banker real estate subsidiary,
Sears said.
   Earnings from the Allstate insurance unit also declined but the
Dean Witter financial services group showed great improvement over
the third quarter of 1989.
   Chicago-based Sears reported net income of $179.2 million, or 53
cents a share, for the three months ending Sept. 30 compared with
$257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
   Revenues rose 5.9 percent to $13.96 billion from $13.18 billion
in the third quarter of 1989, Sears said in a statement.
   Coldwell Banker's operating income fell to $1.8 million from
$81.2 million in the third quarter of 1989, when the division sold
partial interest in several shopping centers.
   Sears said after-tax gains from property sales in the latest
quarter totaled $18.1 million compared with $87.2 million a year
earlier.
   ``The decline was the result of the timing of property sales as
well as the soft residential market,'' Sears said.
   The Sears Merchandise Group, which accounts for more than half
of Sears revenues, posted a 7.6 percent gain in third-quarter
operating income after suffering a 32 percent decline in the second
quarter and a $37.4 million loss in the first.
   Operating income from the retailing division totaled $89.2
million, Sears said. Revenues rose to $7.8 billion from $7.6
billion.
   Brennan, who was given direct oversight of the merchandise group
in early August, said encouraging results in home appliances,
electronics, automotive, and women's apparel reflected the
effectiveness of new retailing strategies that Sears began
implementing in March 1989.
   But Brennan said the performances of Sears' catalog, home
fashions, home improvements, children's clothing and men's apparel
departments remained sluggish.
   Retailing analyst Walter Loeb of Loeb Associates in New York,
said the weakness in such traditional Sears strongholds as home
improvement and home fashions indicated the merchandise group is
still having trouble.
   But Sears said retailing revenues rose faster than selling and
administrative expenses, which suggests Brennan's cost-cutting
efforts are working.
   The cost-saving measures include a 20 percent reduction in the
company's catalog division staff, as well as the offering of
severance packages to 600 workers at Sears' corporate headquarters
in Chicago. Both steps took place last month.
   ``It's too early to be conclusive about it, but I think this
will be a successful program,'' Loeb said.
   Allstate's operating income fell nearly 14 percent to $108.7
million in the third quarter, reflecting catastrophic losses
greater than historical levels. Dean Witter's operating income
soared 60 percent to $57.2 million. The results included a 37
percent increase in brokerage income and 27 percent rise in income
from Discover Card operations.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Sears earned $523.4 million,
or $1.53 per share, on sales of $40.4 billion. That compares with
earnings of $906.4 million, or $2.56 per share, on sales of $38.6
billion in the first nine months of 1989.

<HEAD>Maytag Reorganizes its Hoover Operations in Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maytag Corp. on Wednesday named a new
managing director to its Hoover appliance business in Britain as
part of what it called a major reorganization of the European
business.
   Hoover's appliance and floor care operation in the United
Kingdom has been a drain on Maytag profitability since Maytag
acquired the business in a 1989 takeover of the Chicago Pacific
Corp.
   Daniel Krumm, Maytag's chairman, announced the latest in a
series of steps to shore up the British operations in remarks to
employees at Hoover production facilities in England, Scotland and
Wales. He said the plan is designed to achieve the ``rebirth,
rejuvenation, stability and return to profitability'' of Hoover UK.
   Krumm named veteran labor relations executive William Foust to
succeed Anthony Williamson as managing director of Hoover UK and to
head a task force to speed organizational changes and implement
production efficiencies.
   Foust is the senior vice president of human resources at Maytag
and a former officer of the Magic Chef Co., another Maytag
subsidiary. Krumm said Foust will serve full time in South Wales
until he completes the special assignment, then return to Maytag's
headquarters in the central Iowa community of Newton.
   Williamson, who has worked for Hoover for more than 30 years,
announced he intends to retire but will continue to serve as a
director and to represent Hoover with various industry
associations.
   The shakeup was no surprise, said analyst Russell Leavitt, who
follows Maytag for the New York investment firm Salomon Brothers.
   ``That business has suffered in the last year or two,
essentially since they got it,'' Leavitt said. He said Maytag
executives were dissatisfied with the performance of Hoover UK but
probably needed time to understand industry conditions in Britain,
which has been hit by a major slump in its appliance business.
   Maytag, which does not disclose results from Hoover UK, last
week reported a $15.7 million operating loss from European
operations for the first nine months of the year, compared with an
operating loss of $8.3 million a year earlier. The Hoover UK
operations were a big contributor to the operating loss, said
Maytag spokeswoman Lisa Mendheim.
   The operating loss came despite a 24 percent increase in sales,
to $340.1 million from $273.7 million.
   Maytag had net earnings of $86 million on sales of $2.33 billion
for the first nine months of 1990, compared with profit of $91.7
million on sales of $2.29 billion in the same period a year
earlier.
   The reorganization followed capital improvements and
cost-cutting programs in Britain.
   Maytag said earlier this year it will invest about $22 million
in a major renovation in Wales.
   Hoover reduced its work force by 17 percent in the United
Kingdom in 1989 and cut 700 additional jobs this year. It still has
4,500 workers in Britain out of a global work force of
approximately 25,000.

   Export sales rumors lifted corn and and wheat
futures prices Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade but soybean
futures fell slightly.
   Talk of Soviet interest in U.S. corn continued to support the
grain markets, analysts said.
   Reports that the Soviet Union has chartered freight vessels were
regarded as an indication that Moscow soon will be shopping for
grain, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc.
in Chicago.
   He said the grain markets also were supported by slow sales of
newly harvested corn.
   ``The farmers are really unhappy with these prices and are just
storing it,'' he said.
   Soybean futures were pressured by a government report showing
larger-than-expected soymeal and soyoil stocks, Karlin said.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 1\ cents higher

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp., a building materials manufacturer,
said it will lay off a significant part of its work force after
suffering a third-quarter loss of $11 million.
   The company declined to say how many jobs would be cut. Most of
the impending layoffs will be white-collar, salaried workers at its
Chicago headquarters and across the United States, said USG
spokesman Matthew Gonring.
   The company has trimmed its work force in the last two years
from 21,000 to 14,000 by selling assets and eliminating jobs.
   ``It's a difficult decision, and we regret having to make it,''
Gonring said of the new layoffs. ``But it's being brought on by the
decline in housing, the savings and loan crisis and most recently
the problems in the Mideast.''
   USG said it has suffered from low prices for its gypsum
wallboard.
   The 20-cents-per-share loss, announced Tuesday, compared with a
profit of $9 million, or 16 cents a share, reported a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 slid 4 percent to $538
million from $560 million a year earlier.
   For the nine-month period, the company reported a loss of $2
million, or 4 cents a share, compared with a $21 million profit, or
38 cents a share, in the same period of 1989.
   Nine-month sales fell 6 percent, to $1.6 billion from $1.7
billion, USG said.

<HEAD>FDIC Files $560 Million Lawsuit Against Woods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal bank regulators have filed a $560 million
lawsuit against the former owner of Western Savings Association,
contending he defrauded the failed thrift of at least that much
money.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also accuses Jarrett E.
Woods Jr. of spending $7 million of depositors' money on himself
during the thrift's final months in 1986.
   The lawsuit is one of the largest ever filed by the government
against a savings and loan owner. It was filed Friday in Dallas but
not released until Tuesday.
   The suit accuses Woods and Western Capital, a corporation he
controlled, of engaging in fraud and violating contracts. The
government alleges that in the four years Woods controlled the
thrift, he squandered its deposits on high-risk and fraudulent
investments and improper loans.
   ``The losses suffered by the institution appear to exceed $1
billion, at least $560 million of which was the preventable result
of the policies and practices implemented at Western by Jarrett E.
Woods Jr. and Western Capital Corporation,'' the suit states.
   Woods is accused of using thrift money to refinance his home,
funnelling millions into his children's trust funds, paying off a
personal loan and paying himself an $800,000 bonus and a $41,667
monthly salary.
   When federal regulators closed Western in September 1986,
examiners found ``deficient or non-existent appraisals, inadequate
loan documentation, inaccurate accounting and shoddy
record-keeping,'' the lawsuit states.
   Woods disagreed with the regulators' contentions. He claimed
that the thrift was not insolvent and that he had tried to find
solutions to the examiners' concerns.
   Woods has an unlisted home telephone number and could not be
reached for comment Wednesday. No criminal charges have been filed
against him.

<HEAD>Bankers End Convnetion Dominated by Concerns Over Confidence in
Industry
^With AM-Bankers-Kirk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bankers went home Wednesday after fve days
of ``I'm OK, You're OK'' reassurance among themselves. Now they'll
try to persuade the public.
   Though beset by problems resulting from the slowing economy,
industry leaders maintained that banking remains fundamentally
strong. Restoring public confidence by preaching that message was a
dominant theme of the concluded American Bankers Association
convention.
   Bankers were exhorted by the ABA leadership to become aggressive
champions of the industry in their hometowns.
   ``The key issue ... is the confidence the people place in
banking,'' said ABA President Richard A. Kirk.
   Kirk and others emphasized that banking is in much better
condition than the savings and loan industry. Banking's problems
should be viewed entirely separately than those of the thrifts,
they said.
   The 4,500 conventioneers heard more than cheerleading, however.
   In a particularly blunt speech on Tuesday that the ABA brass had
requested to be toned down, Comptroller of the Currency Robert
Clarke said that confidence in the industry is at its lowest point
in 50 years and bankers are partly to blame.
   ``This is not a time to be kidding ourselves,'' Clarke told the
convention.
   Clarke, the nation's top bank regulator and well-known in the
industry for his frankness, said the industry is in trouble on Main
Street, Wall Street and on Capitol Hill.
   Among other things, Clarke faulted the industry for putting too
many eggs in its real estate basket. The downturn in real estate is
chief among the reasons many banks are suffering either losses or
smaller profits.
   Clarke told reporters that there had been concern that his
speech was too harsh when a draft copy of it was circulated among
some people on Monday. He said he revised one paragraph to clearly
show that he supported the survival of the industry.
   Clarke joined other federal banking officials in calling for
more capitalization in the industry.
   In a forum that concluded the ABA convention Wednesday, a panel
of three economists agreed that the nation is on the brink of a
recession. That's bad news for the banking industry, though the
economists said they expect the recession to be relatively mild.
   Participating in the forum were Arnold A. Dill, chief economist
at Citizens and Southern Corp. in Atlanta; Tucker Hart Adams, chief
economist at Central Banks of Colorado in Denver; and William B.
Conerly, vice president of First Interstate Bank of Oregon in
Portland.
   ``There's a fair chance we won't reach the technical definition
of a recession,'' said Ms. Adams. ``I consider it very mild.''
   Also dominating discussion at the ABA convention was how
Congress may deal with the banking industry next year. Many believe
Congress will enact sweeping reforms.
   ``Clearly, our industry is in the throes of major change, even
perhaps a major restructuring,'' the ABA's Kirk said.
   Edward L. Yingling, executive director of the ABA's government
relations group, said he expects Congress to act on deposit
insurance reform, capital requirements, products and services
reform and interstate banking.
   He also predicted a fierce lobbying effort by the banking
industry and other concerns over the direction of the legislation.
   What the ABA wants in particular is the abolition of the ``too
big to fail'' philosophy that governs bank regulation and
legislation permitting banks to enter other lines of business.
   The traditional regulatory policy ensuring large institutions
against failure gives big banks an unfair advantage over smaller
ones, the organization believes.
   The bankers want permission to move into other businesses, such
as the sale of securities, insurance and real estate, so they can
compete more effectively with other financial services companies.
   Under the ABA's scenario, such services would be provided by
separately regulated divisions, creating a ``wall'' that would not
threaten the security of insured deposits, Yingling said.

<HEAD>No Deadline Yet in Chrysler Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers union officials so far are
holding off on setting a deadline for reaching a national contract
with Chrysler Corp., a union official said Wednesday.
   In Canada, however, negotiators for Chrysler Canada Ltd. and the
Canadian Auto Workers union bargained through Tuesday night to beat
a midnight Thursday deadline for a new pact covering about 10,000
Canadian workers.
   The UAW and the CAW are pressing for contracts similar to those
they negotiated separately with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and those companies' Canadian operations.
   ``It's doubtful if a contract completion date will be set
today,'' UAW spokesman Bob Barbee said Wednesday. ``There's still
lots of stuff that has to be done before anything like that.''
   He added that by week's end, the union might set a deadline for
reaching a contract with Chrysler. Setting a deadline increases
pressure on negotiators.
   The UAW has about 63,000 members at Chrysler's U.S. operations.
   Earlier this fall, the unions reached a contract agreement with
GM after setting a deadline. The unions and Ford then negotiated a
contract without a deadline.
   Before talks with Chrysler intensified this week, there was
speculation that a bumpy road was ahead of UAW and company
negotiators, and a deadline might be set quickly.
   But on Monday, Chrysler's Canadian subsidiary gave the CAW an
economic proposal union officials said was close to the GM-Ford
Canadian patten agreement.
   Analysts viewed that move as encouraging for the U.S. talks.
   A Chrysler official, speaking Wednesday on the condition of
anonymity, said main negotiators, including UAW President Owen
Bieber and Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John, met twice
Tuesday, but no similar meetings were scheduled for Wednesday.
   ``They might have to digest everything,'' the official said.
   Union and company officials also said work continued in
bargaining subcommittees, which focus on specific areas of
negotiations.

<HEAD>U.S. Announces Offer of Drastic Tariff Cut in Uruguay Round</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Wednesday offered drastic
across-the-board tariff cuts in the Uruguay Round trade
liberalization talks and called on other negotiators to
reciprocate.
   The chief U.S. delegate, Warren Lavorel, told a committee
meeting that the offer, if fully implemented, would represent a
reduction of 43 percent in the average trade-weighted tariff.
   He noted the offer was considerably higher than the 33 percent
target set in Montreal at the mid-term review of the 4-year-old
talks.
   Lavorel said the offer covered all product areas, including
domestically sensitive items such as textiles. He said continued
U.S. support for the offer would depend on the reactions of other
trading partners.
   A summary of his statement was reported by a meeting source who
declined to be identified.
   Briefing reporters on the general discussion at the Trade
Negotiating Committee, the source said the European Community again
came under criticism for its delay in submitting a formal proposal
on cutting farm support in the Uruguay Round.
   The EC's proposal, yet to be formalized, would cut subsidies by
30 percent, a reduction described as totally insufficient by the
United States and other leading farm-exporting countries.
   According to the source, Argentina's Leopoldo Tettamanti said
negotiators had already lost two weeks waiting for the Community
offer. Tettamanti warned that the talks would enter into a ``deep
crisis'' because the EC's offer might not lead to ``any meaningful
negotiation.''

<HEAD>Beech Slowing Production Because of Uncertainty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beech Aircraft Corp. said it will slow
production of some models and stop hiring new workers because of
the possibility of a shrinking marketplace.
   The company's actions take place as fuel costs have risen due to
the crisis in the Middle East.
   ``In response to this situation we are taking a number of
preliminary actions while we evaluate our current market
situation,'' Jim Gregory, director of corporate affairs for Beech,
said in a written statement Tuesday.
   Gregory said Beech was not trying to influence Congress'
consideration of a luxury tax to help reduce the federal deficit.
``These actions are being taken in response to a slowing
marketplace,'' he said.
   House negotiators Wednesday appeared to have accepted the Senate
version of the proposed 10 percent tax, which would apply to the
excess cost of any airplane above $250,000.
   Gregory said Beech was making ``production-rate adjustments on
some models and reducing overtime.''
   Beech has quit advertising for new employees, halted
pre-employment training for some prospective workers and is
``reconsidering our plans to add a significant number of new
employees by year-end,'' Gregory said.
   He did not detail the company's plans and declined comment on
the possibility of layoffs. But an industry source said layoffs may
occur because Beech had been adding employees in anticipation of
strong sales and increased production rates.
   At a trade convention in New Orleans three weeks ago, Beech
officials said the company had a bright sales outlook and was
planning to add 500 jobs within the next 12 months, as many as 300
by the end of the year.
   Officials of two other Wichita-area aircraft makers, Cessna
Aircraft Co. and Learjet, said that although they are concerned
about the uncertainty in their business, they had not made any
changes in operations.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The holding company National Intergroup Inc.
said Wednesday it lost almost $1 million in the second quarter
after settling with shareholders in a takeover bid.
   The $4.2 million settlement brought on a loss of $988,000, or 11
cents a share, on revenue of $700 million in the quarter, NII said.
That compared with a profit of $8.6 million, or 33 cents a share,
on revenue of $561.5 million for the same 1989 period.
   In the first six months ended Sept. 30, NII posted a $282.7
million loss, or $13.12 per share, on sales of $1.3 billion. The
loss was partly due to $239.5 million set aside during the first
quarter to cover anticipated losses from the sale of the company's
Ben Franklin and Permian Corp. subsidiaries and a $26.7 million
charge associated with closing NII's Pittsburgh office.
   The company is moving its headquarters to Dallas.
   In the first six months of 1989, NII's earnings totaled $21.5
million, or 87 cents a share, on sales of $1.1 billion.

<HEAD>Winnebago Goes to 4-Day Week, Layoffs Planned</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Durable Goods Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a gasoline rebate offer yet to
recharge stalled motor-home sales, Winnebago Industries Inc. has
cut back to a four-day work week and says it will begin laying off
white-collar workers.
   The recent moves by the recreational vehicle giant are a
dramatic illustration of how a business already hurting from
softness in the economy has been walloped by the unexpected, in
this case a stunning rise in fuel prices since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait nearly three months ago.
   An industry analyst said Winnebago appears to be taking the
right steps to return to profitability once the gasoline price
outlook and the nation's economic prospects brighten.
   Analyst Michael Sabbann, who follows the recreational vehicle
industry for the Minneapolis investment firm of Piper Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, also said Winnebago is not alone and that other
manufacturers are in a bind.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders to U.S.
factories of durable goods, such as appliances and vehicles
designed to last three years or more, fell 1.7 percent in
September. Transportation orders fell 6.8 percent.
   Winnebago, with products priced at $27,000 and up, has reported
five straight quarterly losses and had a record $17.8 million loss
in the fiscal year that ended Aug. 25 as sales fell 23 percent from
the previous year.
   In May, directors suspended semiannual dividends to
shareholders. In late September, Winnebago began layoffs and
temporary factory shutdowns.
   Earlier this month, it began offering rebates to new buyers,
guaranteeing to reimburse gasoline expenses above $1 a gallon for
the first 12 months or 12,000 miles of ownership, whichever came
first.
   Sheila Davis, a Winnebago spokeswoman, said Wednesday that the
rebates have not led to any noticeable increase in sales. ``It's a
little too early to tell'' about the success of the program, she
said.
   She said company factories in the Iowa communities of Forest
City, Hampton and Lorimor have been on Monday-to-Thursday schedules
since last week, with 1,000 production workers idled each Friday.
The four-day week will continue indefinitely, she said.
   An additional 500 workers were laid off since the end of
September with no plans to recall them. Later this week, an
austerity program will be announced that will include layoffs among
the ranks of 800 office workers, supervisors and executives, she
said.
   ``Unfortunately, those are the things that have to be done,''
Sabbann said. ``The whole industry cycle has turned against them.''
   But he said Winnebago is in a good position to regain ground
once the economy improves. He noted the company's claim to more
than 60 percent of the market in sales of micro-mini motor homes, a
more fuel-efficient recreational vehicle that has taken a growing
share of the RV business.
   Forest City Mayor Paul Jefson said the company's travails are as
serious as he can recall for Winnebago, the major employer in the
community of 4,300. Jefson's memory goes back to when the factory
burned down in September 1964. Counting workers now laid off, the
company has about 2,600 employees.
   When Winnebago is in trouble, so is Forest City, Jefson said,
and as problems began surfacing earlier this year ``we knew it's
important that we live within the means of the city. It will affect
us.''
   Robert Rollefson, a broker at the Forest City office of the
investment firm R.G. Dickinson &amp; Co. and veteran Winnebago watcher,
said the company is faced with its most serious challenge since the
early 1970s. That's when an Arab oil embargo and the first oil
price shock left the company with acres of unsold motor homes.
   ``Everywhere you looked, there was an ocean of white aluminum,''
Rollefson said. The company formed convoys of vehicles and drove
them across country until they were sold, sometimes at prices way
below cost.
   Winnebago is in better financial shape today, but ``the outlook
now and the outlook then may be about the same,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Worldwide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply Wednesday amid
continuing dismay over the health of the U.S. economy and
lawmakers' ongoing haggling over the federal budget.
   Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, one troy
ounce of gold rose $2.30 to settle at $373.50. Later, Republic
National Bank in New York quoted gold at $372.75 an ounce, up
$1.50.
   The dollar fell in overseas trading and continued to lose ground
when activity shifted to the United States. A Commerce Department
report showing a 1.7 percent decline in September orders for
durable goods - the third decline in four months - offered fresh
evidence that the U.S. economy is weakening.
   The report ``refocused the market's attention on the
deteriorating fundamentals,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at
IDEA.
   Investors also did not want to hold dollars because of
uncertainty over the the federal budget, even though there were
indications that a compromise on a deficit-reduction bill could
come before Thursday.
   The Federal Reserve has hinted it would be inclined to lower
interest rates once a budget package is in place. Lower interest
rates would spur the economy but also would lessen the value of
dollar-denominated securities, thereby reducing investors' need for
the U.S. currency.
   Trading was active, with much attention focused on the Japanese
yen, said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. No particular piece of news emerged to push the
yen higher, and some traders attributed its advance to technical
factors.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 128.38 Japanese yen from
127.13 yen at Tuesday's close. Later in London, it fell to 128.05
yen. In New York, the dollar fell further to close at 126.49 yen,
down from 128.15 yen on Tuesday.
   In London the pound rose to $1.9550 from $1.9461 late Tuesday.
In New York, it cost $1.9590 to buy one pound, more expensive than
Tuesday's $1.9435.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates included: 1.5067 German marks, down from 1.5180;
1.2695 Swiss francs, down from 1.2817; 5.0440 French francs, down
from .0820; 1,128.25 Italian lire, down from 1,137.25, and 1.1683
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1721.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.5075 German marks, down from 1.5175; 1.2690 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2810; 5.0470 French francs, down from 5.0700;
1.6990 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7098; 1,128.75 Italian lire,
down from 1,136.50, and 1.1685 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1708.
   Gold was unchanged in London at a late bid of $371.75 a troy
ounce. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $371.10 an ounce,
down from $371.40 late Tuesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 21
cents an ounce to close at $371.80.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.223 a troy ounce, up from $4.219
on Tuesday. But in London the metal was unchanged at a late bid of
$4.24 a troy ounce.

   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine

compared with 247 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,

   Mazda has begun selling sport-utility vehicles made in a Ford
plant in Kentucky.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and

<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., one of the nation's two
major credit-rating agencies, on Wednesday downgraded its rating of
$5 billion worth of debt of Chemical Banking Corp. and several
subsidiaries.
   The downgrade of the nation's sixth-largest banking company
followed a similar rating reduction last month by S&amp;P affecting No.
2 Chase Manhattan Corp.
   S&amp;P said its downgrade of New York-based Chemical reflected its
``expectation of further moderate deterioration in loan quality in
a continued difficult operating environment.''
   However, the rating agency tempered its concern with optimistic
statements about Chemical's prospects.
   `The company has the liquidity and financial flexibility to deal
with the expected loan problems,'' it said. It added that
Chemical's recent decision to reduce its dividend payment ``should
help it rebuild capital after the heavy losses of the past few
years.''
   Chemical spokesman Charles Salmans said the company was
disappointed by the action. ``S&amp;P in its own announcement notes the
quality of Chemical's loan portfolio and the steps we have taken to
build capital,'' he said.
   S&amp;P lowered by one notch the senior debt rating of parent
Chemical Banking and subsidiaries Texas Commerce Bancshares and
Chemical New York.
   It also lowered by one degree its rating on certifas soon as possible.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold C. Abramson Wednesday set a Dec. 14
hearing on the confirmation plan and company spokeswoman Cecilia
Stubbs Norwood said Southland hoped to emerge from court
supervision before the end of the year.
   Ms. Norwood said store operations would not be affected by the
filing and the company had commitments for $400 million in
financing while it proceeds through the bankruptcy process.
   Southland has been struggling since 1987 when the founding
Thompson family, fearing a takeover by the Belzbergs of Canada,
took the company private in a $4.9 billion leveraged buyout.
   The LBO, second highest ever at the time, became more expensive
on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508
points. The crash made it more difficult and more expensive to
arrange financing for the deal.
   Southland first proposed its restructuring in March of this
year, acknowledging that dwindling profits would make it impossible
to meet the debt brought on by the 1987 buyout.
   In April, Southland revealed a fourth-quarter loss of $1.01
billion as it wrote off ``goodwill'' from the buyout. The company
denied the writeoff proved the Thompsons paid too much in the
buyout, but only reflected a decline in the value of the company
assets.
   At first, Southland proposed selling 75 percent of the company
for $400 million to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd. and Seven-Eleven Japan Co.
Ltd., its Japanese franchisees.
   The Thompson family would keep 15 percent and the creditors
would get the rest, along with new securities.
   But enough bondholders would not go along. In July, the Japanese
agreed to take a smaller piece of the company, 70 percent, and
provide more money, $430 million. The Thompsons also agreed to cut
their holdings to 5 percent, while creditors got 25 percent of the
reorganized company in addition to improved terms on their bonds.
   However, creditors forced Southland to require that 95 percent
of the bondholders go along before they would agree to the swap,
and the threshold proved too high to meet by this week's deadline.
   Although the reorganization plan mirrors the restructuring
proposal, it now must be approved by a bankruptcy court and could
still face objections.
   If it succeeds, it will end the Thompson family's control of the
company. None of the three brothers who run Southland would comment
on the bankruptcy, Ms. Norwood said.

   Moody's Investors Service Inc. on Wednesday
downgraded by a notch $45 billion worth of debt by Ford Motor Co.
and some of its financial subsidiaries, saying the company is
vulnerable to dips in the economy.
   The sluggish economy, continued buyer incentive programs that
cut into profits, softening vehicle demand in Europe and fuel costs
``heighten the uncertainties concerning Ford's operating returns
and cash flow during a period of heavy capital spending,'' Moody's
said.
   Even with the downgrade, securities issued by the nation's No. 2
automaker remained well within Moody's investment grade. General
Motors Corp. securities are at the same rating as Ford, and
Chrysler Corp. securities are below both, but still within Moody's
investment grade.
   Ratings issued by Moody's and other companies, such as Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp., are used to measure the credit worthiness of a
company or a subsidiary. A lower credit rating can force a company
to pay higher interest rates when it borrows money.
   Ford spokesman Tom Foote declined to describe the size of Ford's
capital spending program this year. But he said Ford planned to
spend more in the next five years on plants and products than the
$22.2 billion it spent in the last five years of the 1980s.
   ``We believe that our ability to maintain a substantial capital
spending program in the present economic environment reflects the
strong financial position of Ford,'' said a statement from Ford
Vice President and Treasurer David McCammon.
   Through Oct. 20 of this year, sales of Ford's domestic cars and
trucks were 8.6 percent below last year's pace.
   Next week, Ford is expected to announce third-quarter earnings
of about half the $477.1 million the company earned during the same
period last year.
   Moody's also downgraded securities linked to First Nationwide
Bank, a Ford-owned savings and loan institution with headquarters
in San Francisco.
   The ratings agency said First Nationwide was particularly
vulnerable because of its extensive holdings in a softening
commercial real estate market.
   ``We are pleased with First Nationwide's operating performance
this year in the face of a depressed commercial real-estate
market,'' McCammon said.
   ``Additionally, we believe the ratings fail to recognize the
strong overall performance of the Ford Financial Services group
which provides an important element of stability during this period
of relatively weak vehicle demand,'' he said.

   Stock prices edged higher Wednesday in a
drifting session that did nothing to break the indecisive pattern
of activity since the start of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had slipped 26.73
points Monday and Tuesday, rose 10.15 to 2,504.21.
   Advancing issues just barely outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 762 up, 728
down and 490 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.29 million
shares, against 146.30 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 181.59 million shares.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery climbed more than
$1.50 a barrel, to the neighborhood of $31 a barrel, on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts said that helped to put a damper on buying interest in
the stock market, along with persistent worries about the economic
outlook.
   The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders for
durable goods dropped 1.7 percent in September, on top of a
downward-revised decline of 0.8 percent in August.
   The latest decrease stemmed mainly from a drop in transportation
orders, which are often subject to wide short-term fluctuations.
But brokers said it still came as something of an unpleasant
surprise to investors.
   Observers also said the market was on hold awaiting signs of
some resolution of the budget impasse in Washington.
   It is generally agreed that traders' hopes for a relaxation of
the Federal Reserve's credit policy are unlikely to be fulfilled
until some sort of a budget agreement has been reached.
   Wednesday's gainers among the blue chips included International
Business Machines, up 1~ at 108|; Philip Morris, up \ at 48\;
Eastman Kodak, up &lsqb; at 39~, and Westinghouse Electric, up ~ at 25~.
   MCA plunged 8~ to 50 and Matsushita Electric dropped 3 to 141.
Late in the day Matsushita denied reports of a breakdown in merger
talks with MCA.
   Compaq Computer jumped 4&lsqb; to 47{. The company reported
third-quarter earnings of $1.38 a share, up from $1.01 a share in
the corresponding period last year.
   Sun Microsystems, by contrast, fell 4&rsqb; to 15} as the most active
issue in the over-the-counter market. Quarterly earnings reported
by the company on Tuesday came in well below expectations.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.70 billion, or 0.06
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks eked
out a .10 advance to 170.60.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .42 to 367.61, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .24 at 312.60.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped .11 to 340.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 292.69, down .28.

   When Halloween decorations come down this week
and stores start putting up Christmas trees and wreaths, retailers
will begin what is expected to be their bleakest holiday season in
years.
   The faltering economy and the Persian Gulf crisis already have
put a big crimp in consumer spending, with retail sales falling
dramatically in August and September. No one realistically expects
shoppers to put caution aside when they start looking for gifts.
   ``It's going to be a tough Christmas,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, a
retail industry analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc. ``The only
question is, `How bad is it going to be?' ''
   Daniel Barry, of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., was more blunt: ``I think
this is going to be one of the worst Christmases in two decades.''
   Retailers also are expecting a difficult season.
   Kenneth Macke, chairman of Dayton Hudson Corp., said his
company, like most retailers, is planning conservatively to meet
the uncertain mood of American consumers.
   ``They've got job insecurity and oil prices are up,'' Macke said
of consumers. ``If they had a definite answer to some of these
things we'd be better off.''
   Christmas has been something of a guessing game in recent years,
with consumers shopping later in the season and the outcome not
certain until after all the receipts are tallied.
   Many observers believe there won't be any suspense this year,
especially since late summer sales - considered a harbinger of the
Christmas season - were so poor. For instance, Macke's stores,
which include Dayton, Hudson, Marshall Field, Target and Mervyn's,
suffered a 2 percent drop in sales in September.
   ``We have a consumer that's really pulling back,'' said Walter
Loeb, a retailing consultant and analyst. ``He doesn't like $2 a
gallon gas. He doesn't like higher taxes. He doesn't like
unemployment.''
   There are more Americans out of work now than there were a year
ago - the unemployment rate was on an upswing in September, rising
to 5.7 percent, while last December, it was holding steady at 5.3
percent. A consumer who is not working is not going to spend a lot
on Christmas gifts.
   Even those with secure jobs are scaling back gift-giving plans.
Since oil prices shot higher following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, Americans have been shelling out more money for gasoline
and heating oil and have less for extras like gifts.
   ``About the only thing that would keep Christmas from being a
disaster is an end to the Mideast crisis'' and a drop in oil
prices, said Barry, the Kidder Peabody analyst.
   Macke said department stores, which generally have more upscale
merchandise, could be more vulnerable to sluggish sales. ``Our
experience is that the consumer has tended to trade down,'' he
said.
   That means there likely will be more ties, books and sweaters
bought this season than stereo sets and expensive jewelry.
   Apparel retailers may also find themselves in a bind. They were
among the hardest hit as sales dropped in late summer.
   For example, J. C. Penney, whose business grew modestly in the
late spring and early summer, saw its sales fall 2.4 percent and
3.4 percent respectively in August and September. Specialty apparel
retailer Limited Inc., which posted moderate increases in the
spring, managed only a 1 percent gain in August and suffered a 3
percent decline in September.
   One segment of the industry likely to fare somewhat better this
Christmas is toy retailers. Parents may scrimp on gifts for adults
so their children find plenty of presents under the tree on Dec.
25.
   ``Santa Claus gets first priority on the dollar,'' said Macke.
   Inventory will be a key to how successful this Christmas will
be. Macke said his stores have bought conservatively and focused on
the kinds of merchandise that are expected to be the biggest
movers.
   But a wild card that can make or break the season is how much
retailers are forced to take price markdowns.
   Markdowns have become almost commonplace in the last few years,
and most analysts expect there will be price-cutting again this
Christmas.
   Edelman, the Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst, predicted markdowns
would not be quite as severe as in Christmas 1989.
   Last year, units of Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department
Stores Inc. reduced prices sharply to bring in cash in a futile
attempt at avoiding bankruptcy court. Other retailers were forced
to follow suit to compete, and bottom lines that quarter - the most
crucial earings period for retailers - were the casualties.
   Barry took a more pessimistic view of markdowns in the upcoming
season and had this advice for consumers: ``Do your Christmas
shopping late, there'll be plenty of merchandise at bargain
prices.''
   If Dayton Hudson's sales appear to be falling short of
projections, Macke said his stores will try to avoid heavy
markdowns by reducing expenses.
   Yet in spite of the so-far glum outlook for the season, some say
it is still possible retailers will be pleasantly surprised.
   Karen Sack, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said that
while ``consumers have definitely cut back spending, I suspect they
will spend for Christmas.''
   Macke, despite his conservative outlook, said, ``I wouldn't be a the
threatened
northern spotted owl, and also rejected a move to cut the Forest
Service road-building effort in half.
   The current obscenity ban, adopted a year ago under pressure
from Helms and his conservative allies, forbids endowment financing
of works that ``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions
of homoeroticism, sadomasochism, the sexual exploitation of
children or ``individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   The Senate bill also would allow endowment chairman John E.
Frohnmayer to continue his requirement that grant recipients sign a
pledge not to produce obscene work. The pledge has caused
widespread protests among artists and resulted in three lawsuits
challenging its constitutionality.
   By contrast, the House voted to ban Frohnmayer's pledge and to
omit any explicit anti-obscenity restrictions.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher crude oil prices lifted Unocal Corp.'s third-quarter
earnings 53 percent, but couldn't boost Exxon Corp.'s earnings over
last year's levels.
   Los Angeles-based Unocal reported Wednesday that earnings for
the period ending Sept. 30 totaled $121 million, or 52 cents per
share, on revenue of $3 billion. That compared with after-tax
profit of $79 million, or 34 cents per share, on revenue of $2.8
billion for the same 199 period.
   Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, said earnings were unchanged from
the third quarter last year, totaling $1.07 billion or 85 cents per
share, on revenue of $29 billion. Revenue for the third quarter
last year totaled $23.6 billion.

   Unocal's crude oil prices jumped $4.60 a barrel to an average of
$20.22 in the third quarter, said Richard J. Stegemeier, Unocal's
chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Crude oil prices rose sharply due to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But Stegemeier said earnings from Unocal's refining and
marketing operations fell because the company was unable to pass
the full price on to consumers. Earnings dropped to $34 million
from $39 million in the same 1989 quarter.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Unocal reported a 27 percent
earnings jump to $363 million, or $1.55 per share, on revenue of
$8.4 billion. That compared with $286 million, or $1.22 per share,
on revenue of $8.5 billion for the same period last year.
   Unocal's nine-month increase included a $132 million after-tax
gain from the sale of the company's wholly owned oil and gas
subsidiary in Norway.

<BYLINE>Exxon</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon said earnings from its refining and marketing operations
dropped 55 percent to $246 million, also blaming an inability to
fully recover the crude price increases.
   Both companies' chemical operations suffered earnings declines,
although Unocal's 2 percent drop was a far cry from Exxon's 75
percent reduction.
   Exxon said higher costs for raw materials and a sluggish
industry combined for the steep decline.
   The company's nine-month earnings increased 14 percent to $3.4
billion, or $2.73 per share, on revenue of $81.8 billion. That
compared to after-tax profit of $3 billion, or $2.37 per share, on
revenue of $69.5 billion for the same period last year.
   Last year's nine-month earnings included a provision for the
Valdez accident off the shore of Alaska and an accounting change.

   Crude oil rebounded sharply on the futures
market Wednesday to move back above $30 per barrel as traders
placed less faith in speculation that peace was likely in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``Perceptions are hardening here, with the Saudis and U.S.
officials indicating we are still a long way from having a
settlement with Iraq,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``I think there's no fear of peace, but likewise no fear of
hostilities. There's a perception that a stalemate could persist
for a while,'' Baker said.
   Light sweet crude oil rose $1.71 to $31.08 for December delivery
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. All other contract
months traded higher.
   Crude's move up erased part of a steep decline that had stripped
away more than half of the ``war premium,'' which pushed oil to $40
per barrel in the weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``It was down about $10 in three or four days, so you were due
for a bit of a bounce anyway,'' said Ed Kevelson, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Speculators were responding to news that the Pentagon may deploy
more U.S. troops to the Gulf, as well as a statement from Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., that the nation appears headed toward
conflict in the region.
   Prices also strengthened an American Petroleum Institute report,
released Tuesday evening, that showed the nation's supplies of
crude oil and gasoline went down last week, as did refinery
operations. API showed a slight increase in the stockpile of home
heating oil.
   Refined petroluem products traded higher along with crude
Wednesday, with gasoline taking a bigger jump than heating oil
because of the API statistics.
   Unleaded gasoline for November delivery rose 5.49 cents to 85.39
cents per gallon, with later delivery months all trading higher.
Heating oil rose 4.06 cents to 85.12 cents a gallon for November
delivery, with all other contract months higher.
   Natural gas fell 8 cents to $2.44 per 1,000 cubic feet for
December delivery, with other months also dropping.
   After oil's record fall of $5.41 per barrel on Monday that
pushed it below $30 for the first time in weeks, trading turned
confused, with prices moving in different directions as buyers and
sellers tried to figure out what would happen next in the Mideast
standoff.
   When oil shot back up Wednesday, it left traders wondering
whether they had seen only a correction from the earlier slide or
the beginning of another steady climb.

<HEAD>Goodyear Shows Loss For Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Wednesday
blamed a depressed tire market and continued restructuring for a
third-quarter loss of $61.4 million, or $1.06 per share.
   The company also reiterated plans to eliminate 3,000 jobs, most
of them salaried positions. Most of the cuts were announced in June
and September.
   In September, the tiremaker warned shareholders about a possible
loss for the quarter. Goodyear earned $70.5 million, or $1.22 per
share, in the third quarter of 1989.
   The 1990 quarterly loss reflects unusual charges of $51.7
million, or 89 cents per share, for restructuring. The costs were
incurred from a realignment of European tire marketing, the phasing
out of medium and heavy truck tire production in Quebec, $22.2
million in environmental cleanup costs and depreciation of the All
American Pipeline System.
   The company also blamed the third-quarter loss on increased
expenses, severe competition in the tire replacement market,
reduced auto and truck production, and production cutbacks to
reduce inventories.
   Worldwide sales increased 8.2 percent in the third quarter to
$2.9 billion. Goodyear ranks second to Groupe Michelin in sales,
according to the trade magazine Tire Business.
   As part of the restructuring, about 3,000 jobs will be cut to
reduce Goodyear's worldwide staff to 106,000 by mid-1992, company
Chairman Tom H. Barrett said in a message to shareholders.
   The total includes 1,200 jobs to be eliminated in a European
restructuring Goodyear announced in September, and 1,100 jobs that
will be lost in a domestic restructuring announced in June, said
Hank Ruppel, a spokesman in Goodyear's Akron headquarters.
   Goodyear began making some cuts in July and will continue
phasing out the other jobs until mid-1992, he said. Some of the
cuts will come through attrition.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Goodyear reported a loss of
$49.9 million, or 86 cents per share. The company earned $192.1
million, or $3.33 per share, during the first nine months of last
year.
   Sales rose 4 percent in the nine-month period to $8.4 billion.

<HEAD>Polly Peck Apply to be Placed in Administration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polly Peck International PLC, the troubled British
food and electronics conglomerate, asked for court assistance
Tuesday to sort out its $1.95 billion debt woes.
   The decision to apply for a court-appointed administrator
followed weeks of wrangling with creditors over financing.
   The company, which was forced to suspend trading of its shares
on the London stock market Sept. 20, said in a brief statement its
board ``resolved'' to take the action.
   A Polly Peck spokesman added, ``The company believes that taking
this step will result in the survival of the company and its
operations as going concerns.''
   Court administration is a form of bankruptcy which enables the
company to reduce its debt in an orderly fashion with the guidance
of the British courts. It does not always mean the company
concerned will be liquidated.
   The court administrator will decide whether Polly Peck's debts
can be serviced through existing operations or through a partial or
full liquidation of the company.
   Company officials held a series of meetings with bankers
throughout the day Wednesday.
   In the past week Polly Peck chairman and chief executive Asil
Nadir has tried to round up financial support in Turkey and
northern Cyprus.
   Polly Peck, which has operating subsidiaries in the United
States, urkey and Japan, has been operating under a temporary debt
standstill agreement since Oct. 5.
   The company sought the moratorium after creditors withdrew about
100 million pounds, or $195 million, in short-term financing and
pressed for answers on the financial status of the company after
its share suspension. The moratorium was scheduled to expire Nov.
9.
   Nadir has been dogged in the British press by allegations of
links to a reputed Polly Peck share-support scheme. The company and
Nadir, who was questioned by the Serious Fraud Office Sept. 20,
have denied any knowledge of wrongdoing.
   Bankers have called Polly Peck's troubles a crisis of
confidence. They said in the early stages of talks that they were
inclined to give the company time to sort out its financial
troubles.
   Polly Peck's status, however, deteriorated sharply in recent
days as bankers pressed the company for answers about Nadir's
finance-hunting trip to Turkey and northern Cyprus.
   Their growing unease was signalled by calls for early repayment
of outstanding debts, and more significantly by the move of
National Bank of Canada on Monday to petition the British courts to
liquidate the company to meet its debts.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Drop, Precious Metals Gain As Oil Prices Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Wednesday, ending a four-day
runup, and precious metals rallied as a bounce in oil prices
rekindled worries about the economy.
   On other commodity markets, orange juice futures surged; grains
and soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 1.4 cents to 3.5 cents lower on New
York's Commodity Exchange with the contract for spot delivery at
$1.29 a pound, down 3.2 cents.
   The sell-off erased more than half of Tuesday's gains, which had
been fueled by fears of a tight supply and perceptions that easing
crude oil prices meant the U.S. economy might not be heading into a
severe recession.
   The copper market tends to respond to economic signals because
copper is used widely in construction and manufacturing.
   But oil prices leaped Wednesday after U.S. and Saudi Arabian
leaders reaffirmed their position that Iraq must withdraw from
Kuwait unconditionally.
   Analysts said oil futures also were supported by Sen. Richard
Lugar's comment that ``we are very close to conflict'' in the
Persian Gulf and by an industry report Tuesday showing a
larger-than-expected drop last week in U.S. crude suplies.
   Tim Evans, a copper trader with Deak International Inc., said
copper's decline also reflected profit-taking after a gain of about
9 cents a pound in four days.
   Deak Vice President Anne Orton said Far East demand for precious
metals had increased as the dollar declined in value against other
major currencies in the last few weeks.
   Gold futures settled $2.10 to $2.30 higher on the Commodity
Exchange with the spot price at $373.50 a troy ounce; silver was
0.2 cent to 0.4 cent higher with October at $4.223 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil
futures ended $1.68 to $1.95 higher with December at $31.08 a
barrel; heating oil was 4.05 cents to 4.55 cents higher with
November at 85.12 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 4.1 cents
to 5.49 cents higher with November at 85.39 cents a gallon.
   Orange juice futures rose sharply in their fourth straight daily
advance on the New York Cotton Exchange as the market continued to
rebound from a collapse precipitated by an Oct. 11 government
prediction for a bumper Florida orange crop.
   Orange juice rallied despite a prediction from the Florida
Department of Citrus that retail prices for orange juice will drop
nearly 12 percent during the coming year because of high Florida
production and record world supplies.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures ended 3.25 cents to
4.10 cents higher with November at $1.19 a pound.
   Export sales rumors lifted corn and and wheat futures on the
Chicago Board of Trade but soybean futures fell slightly.
   Reports that the Soviet Union has chartered freight vessels were
regarded as an indication that Moscow soon will be shopping for
grain, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc.
in Chicago.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 1} cents higher with December
at $2.64} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with
December at $2.33 a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher
with December at $1.24\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3}
cents lower with November at $6.10} a bushel.
   Cattle futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, boosted
by strong cash fundamentals including reports that steers fetched
prices as high as $80.50 per hundredweight in western Kansas.
   Lower prices for pork products contributed to a drop in pork
futures prices, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent to .47 cent higher with December at
77.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .40 cent higher
with October at 87.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .38
cent lower with December at 53.82 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.33 cents lower to .30 cent higher with February at
66 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Compaq Third-Quarter Profit Up 42 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. said Wednesday its profit
rose 42 percent in the third quarter.
   Earnings in the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $124
million, or $1.38 a share, compared with $87.1 million, $1.01 a
share, in the same quarter last year. Per-share earnings were
adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split effective June 29.
   Revenue at the personal computer maker totaled to $863 million,
a 26 percent jump over 1989 third-quarter revenue of $683 million.
   ``Excellent sales growth during this quarter can be attributed
to continued European strength and increased momentum in the North
American market,'' said Rob Canion, president and chief executive
officer.
   The third-quarter profit included a one-time, pre-tax gain of
$27.1 million from an increase in the carrying value of Compaq's
investment in Conner Peripherals Inc. This increased earnings per
share by 20 cents after taxes.
   Profit in the 1989 quarter included a gain of $13.7 million, or
10 cents a share, also from the investment in the computer disc
drive maker, and a gain of $7.6 million, or 6 cents a share, from
the sale of Conner stock.
   Compaq said its profits were improved during the most-recent
quarter by lower material costs, factory efficiencies and lower
exchange rates for the dollar, which boost the value of overseas
sales in dollar terms.
   International sales comprised 53 percent of Compaq's revenue
during the quarter.
   For the year's first nine months, Compaq said it earned $320
million, or $3.63 a share, up from $254 million, or $2.97 a share,
in the same period last year. Revenue totaled $2.6 billion, vs.
$2.1 billion.

<HEAD>Continental Considered Bankruptcy, May Sell Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY BENJAMINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines' board of directors briefly
considered filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but decided instead to
seek other ways to return to financial health, a spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Unidentified sources quoted in Wednesday's editions of The New
York Times and The Wall Street Journal said a team of lawyers
worked through the weekend to prepare Chapter 11 papers to be filed
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after a board meeting on Monday.
   Continental responded to the reports by issuing a statement
Wednesday saying it had no plans to file for protection from
creditors.
   ``We have streamlined our management, and like the rest of the
industry, are considering other prudent business steps to assist
during the fuel crisis,'' the airline said. ``However, Chapter 11
is not one of the means we intend to take.''
   Later Wednesday, spokesman Ned Walker said, ``The board examined
several different options, one of which was Chapter 11. But it was
rejected in a unanimous vote by the board.
   ``Chapter 11 just doesn't make sense for us. We have a lot of
alternatives,'' Walker said.
   They include possible asset sales, introduction of outside
investors and cost controls, such as the postponement of a
multimillion-dollar image campaign, he said.
   Continental stock dropped 1| to $4 per share Wednesday on the
American Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it
had downgraded its ratings on debt of Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc. and Continental Airlines, because of problems brought on by
higher fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel.
   The airline decided last week to remove 17 aircraft that were no
longer fuel efficient from service on Dec. 1 and replace them with
more efficient models. Walker said jet fuel costs have risen 125
percent since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   A $1.2 billion order for 25 Boeing 757s will still go through,
he added.
   ``We're in discussions with some parties that are seriously
interested in investing'' in Continental, Walker said.
   Continental's core operations ``remain strong,'' he said.
   ``Speculation that efforts to contain costs might include a
major downsizing of the airline is just that - speculation,'' the
airline's statement said.
   The reports that Continental had considered bankruptcy surfaced
a day after the carrier realigned its senior management team by
cutting five top executives in an effort to trim costs.
   For the first half of the year, Continental, which until June
was known as Texas Air Corp., lost $8.7 million, compared with a
loss of $365 million in the period a year ago. In June the
carrier's liabilities totaled $1.6 billion.
   Third-quarter results, which have not yet been reported, are
expected to show that Continental suffered losses during the
normally busy summer travel season and has been hurt by higher fuel
prices since the invasion of Kuwait.
   Frank Lorenzo, who recently stepped down as chairman of
Continental but remains on the board, reportedly opposes a Chapter
11 filing by the airline, as does Jan Carlzon, chairman of
Scandinavian Airlines System, which owns 16.8 percent of
Continental stock. A bankruptcy petition filing would reduce the
value of SAS's holdings.

<HEAD>Interior Secretary Opposes Japanese Company Purchase Of Park
Concession</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-MCA-Matsushita</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manual Lujan will try to
prevent a Japanese company from owning food and lodging concessions
in America's national parks, officials said Wednesday.
   The issue of foreign ownership surfaced in connection with a
Japanese company's possible purchase of MCA Inc., which owns a
subsidiary that provides concessions at Yosemite National Park in
California.
   James Ridenour, director of the National Park Service, recently
urged MCA to sell the Yosemite concessions before the Japanese
company, Matsushita Electric Industries, acquires MCA, Interior
spokesman Steve Goldstein said.
   He said Ridenour made the request in a telephone call to MCA
chairman Lew Wasserman with the full support of Lujan.
   ``The secretary believes that the concessions in our national
parks should be run by American-owned companies. He wants to make
sure MCA was clear on our position,'' said Goldstein.
   The MCA subsidiary, Yosemite &amp; Curry Co., has estimated holdings
in Yosemite of between $100 million and $200 million. The company
provides restaurants, lodging and stores at the park under a
contract with the National Park Service.
   Officials with Matsushita, MCA and Curry declined comment about
the discussions involving MCA and Matsushita or Ridenour's
telephone call.
   Goldstein said there is nothing in law to prevent a Japanese
company from being a concessionaire at a national park, but that
such ownership could be taken into account when the Curry Co.,
contract is up for normal renewal in 1993.
   ``We understand the amount of ill will that would come from (a
Japanese) acquisition,'' he said. ``Manuel Lujan believes in buying
American,'' he added.
   Matsushita has been holding discussions to buy MCA for a
reported $8.6 billion. The sides reportedly are having difficulty
agreeing on a price and the Japanese company has put off further
discussions until mid-November.
   MCA owns Universal Studios record companies, a film library and
a television station in addition to Curry.
   Ridenour urged Wasserman to sell its park concessions subsidiary
to a private group before dealing with Matsushita. He said the Park
Service also would be interested in buying the concession.
   The Wilderness Society already has expressed interest in
competing with Curry for the Yosemite concession in 1993.
   Normally, the contract holder has the advantage in bidding on a
contract renewal. But recently the Interior Department, at Lujan's
insistence, has sought to make the bidding more competitive.
   Park officials at Yosemite, meanwhile, have received about a
half dozen letters from park visitors complaining about the
possible ownership of the concessions by a foreign company.
   ``American parks and everything in them need to belong to
Americans ... not to foreign investors,'' wrote Lenore Cymes of
Palo Alto, Calif.

   A hog industry group Wednesday condemned
Common Market plans to ban U.S. pork shipments to 12 European
countries because American plants don't meet European sanitation
standards.
   ``This is an artificial trade barrier, not a food safety
issue,'' said Mike Wehler, president of the National Pork Producers
Council.
   ``The U.S. pork industry has bent over backwards to accommodate
European sanitation requirements, even though many of those
standards are not based on scientific evidence,'' he said.
   The council said the 12-nation European Community on Monday
informed Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter it plans to stop
all U.S. pork shipments as of next Wednesday on the grounds that no
U.S. plant meets its sanitation requirements.
   The council said exports of U.S. pork products to the European
nations account for more than $10 million a year in sales.

<HEAD>Buffett Buys 9.8 Percent Stake in Wells Fargo</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with closing stock price in 8th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wells Fargo &amp; Co., hammered on Wall Street
along with other big banks this year, said Wednesday it welcomed
billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett's purchase of a 9.8 percent
stake in the company.
   Wells Fargo denied it was under any takeover pressure, despite
the plunge in the price of its shares from a high of $86 during the
past year to a low of $41.25 recently.
   The bank said it had not agreed to any special terms with
Buffett, of Omaha, Neb., and did not view him as a ``white knight''
who bought the shares to thwart a takeover.
   ``We are pleased to have him as a shareholder, given his
reputation as an astute investor,'' said Wells Fargo spokesperson
Mary Essary. ``He recognizes long-term value in companies.''
   The purchase made Buffett, known for his prescience in picking
stocks, the largest shareholder of Wells Fargo stock. The next
largest is The Capital Group Inc. of Los Angeles, which owns a 9.3
percent stake, according to a proxy statement filed last March.
   In a federal filing Tuesday, Buffett disclosed that nine
subsidiaries of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, bought 5,030,600
shares of Wells Fargo.
   He did not state the price paid for the shares, but Wells Fargo
stock has been trading in recent days at about $48 a share. Some 5
million shares at that price would come to about $240 million.
   Wells Fargo stock closed at $50.50 per share, up $1.37{,
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Buffett had no further comment beyond the filing, but planned to
make a full statement in next year's annual report to Wells Fargo
shareholders, said a spokeswoman at Berkshire Hathaway.
   Major California banks, including Wells Fargo, have been hurt on
Wall Street this year by the sluggish economy, fears of a deepening
recession, and worries that the real estate market might collapse
the way it did in the Northeast.
   But some of those worries appear to have been exaggerated, and
Wells Fargo and several other banks have weathered the problems
reasonably well.
   Wells Fargo recently reported that earnings for the quarter
ended Sept. 30 rose 7 percent from a year ago to $3.03 per share on
net income of $162.6 million. The bank has $51.5 billion in assets.
   ``We feel that our stock has been adversely affected by the
marketplace in general and not by the results that we ourselves
have been showing,'' Essary said. ``We have been giving consistent
performance and we feel very positive about our company and our
ability to weather any future downtowns.''
   She said Buffett probably was interested in Wells Fargo because
``being a strong company, the decrease in the stock has provided an
attractive buying opportunity.''
   In the past, Buffett has bought sizeable stakes in companies
under special terms. He has served as a friend of management once
he is in place, deterring hostile bidders from making any takeover
efforts against the company.
   His moves also are watched on Wall Street where he is seen as a
savvy, long-term investor.
   A few months ago, Buffett agreed to buy 12 percent to 14 percent
of USAir Group Inc.'s stock through a new issue valued at $358
million, a move that could block a hostile takeover.
   Buffett, who made a fortune buying little-known stocks, also
owns big stakes in Coca Cola Co., the Salomon Brothers Inc.
investment house and Gillette Co. He owns the Buffalo News
newspaper.
   He played the role of friendly squire to razor maker Gillette,
the object of two hostile takeover bids in three years.

<HEAD>Shugrue Predicts Break-Even by February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airline's push to get more business
travelers could help the money-losing carrier break even by
February, bankruptcy trustee Martin Shugrue said.
   The effort involves nearly doubling the size of Eastern's
first-class cabins and offering first-class corporate fares below
the industry's coach average.
   Shugrue, who was appointed in April to try to salvage the
carrier, said the effort has ``taken off like a rocket ship.''
   His optimistic outlook came in a Miami Herald interview Tuesday
at a time when creditors are balking at releasing more operating
funds and speculation has revived that Eastern may be dismantled.
   The Miami-based carrier has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization since March 1989 after Machinists went on strike,
and was still losing $2 million a day in its most recent quarterly
report during the summer.
   Eastern said its new business traveler program has added 4,000
bookings a day. The airline said it needs business travelers
because they fly frequently and don't rely on so-called super-saver
fares.
   Shugrue's rosy outlook wasn't shared by industry watchers.
   ``It would be a tall order to not only overcome their losses on
a daily basis, but to then go to a profit,'' said Robert J.
Joedicke, an airline specialist with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Meanwhile, Shugrue said he will ask creditors for more money
from Eastern's escrow fund in November. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland approved a $50 million draw in October.
   Shugrue said American Airlines, America West, Delta Air Lines,
United Airlines and USAir have expressed interest in buying certain
Eastern assets.
   He said Northwest Airlines, Pan Am and TWA have had discussions
with Eastern, and Delta has confirmed interest in buying 19 Eastern
gates in Atlanta.
   Delta, Eastern's chief rival because of their shared interest in
Atlanta, has cut selected coach fares in response to Eastern, but
Shugrue said he doesn't think Delta can do much to undercut
Eastern's corporate push.
   ``We expected Delta to match the fares, but they can't double
the size of their first-class cabins like we have,'' he said.

   John Jefferson Green figured one day in 1927 that
he could lure more customers into his Southland Ice Co. store if he
stocked milk, eggs and bread, giving birth to the convenience store
industry.
   The same year, Joe C. ``Jodie'' Thompson Jr. went to work for
the ice company, selling ice from the docks.
   Sixty-three years later, the company Thompson once led out of
bankruptcy is back in bankruptcy court. The leading convenience
store chain became a victim of a $4.9 billion debt-financed
takeover and increased competition from gasoline retailers.
   Southland Corp. filed Wednesday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors. In hopes of speeding the process,
Southland also filed a reorganization plan that would give 70
percent of the company to Japanese investors in exchange for $430
million in new cash. Creditors would get 25 percent of the company,
leaving 5 percent for the Thompson family.
   Green's innovation started Southland's expansion beyond peddling
ice. The stores, renamed Tote'm and using totem poles as a symbol,
began selling gasoline in 1928; beer, snacks and grocery items and
Slurpees came later. Diversification eventually would include
dairies, refineries, food processors and even an auto parts chain.
   But by 1931 the company was struggling in the Great Depression,
and went through its first takeover as Middle West Utilities bought
out the shareholders.
   Thompson, then 30, was named president, and later became the
receiver when Middle West itself went bankrupt. The Thompson family
has controlled the company ever since.
   With the repeal of prohibition, Southland began selling beer in
1933; growth was spurred again in 1935 with the introduction of the
paper milk carton.
   Thompson even founded Oak Farms Dairy to make the products that
made Southland the largest retailer of dairy items in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area.
   In 1939, Southland had 60 stores, all in Texas. Expansion
outside of the state didn't come until 1954, when the now-renamed
7-Eleven stores opened in Miami and Jacksonville, Fla.
   The chain once reached a peak of more than 7,000 stores
worldwide. Today there are closer to 6,800, with another 5,900 run
by affiliates and franchisees.
   Jodie Thompson died in 1961 at the age of 60, and his oldest
son, John P. Thompson took over as president. Jere W. Thompson, the
second son, was elected to the company's board of directors.
   It wasn't until 1965 that the Slurpee, an iced slush drink, came
along.
   Southland purchased Citgo Petroleum Corp. in 1983, but sold half
interest in the refinery years later to a subsidiary of state-owned
Petroleos de Venezuela, SA for $290 million.
   Four years later, the events began that laid the basis for
Southland's demise.
   As junk-bond fed buyout fever was building, the Belzberg family
of Canada began talking about buying the Dallas company.
   But the Thompsons wanted to keep control, so they undertook
their own takeover. Using the technique known as a leveraged
buyout, the family bought all the common shares outstanding with
borrowed money, pledging as collateral Southland's assets.
   Then the stock market crashed, interest rates shot up, and the
cost of borrowing money surged. Southland couldn't pay its bills
and sought the sanctuary of bankruptcy court.

   Here is a brief history of The Southland Corp., owner of the
7-Eleven convenience store chain, which filed for protection from
creditors Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court:
   
   - 1927: The Southland Co. is formed in the Dallas suburb of Oak
Cliff from four separate companies operating eight ice plants and
21 retail ice stations. - 1928: Southland builds and leases
gasoline sales stands to oil companies at its 10 Tote'm stores.
   - 1931: Middle West Utilities buys out Southland shareholders. A
year later, the company becomes bankrupt and a reorganization is

   Breckenridge Ski Corp. plans to
nearly double its ski acreage with a 10-year project costing about
$75 million, the company announced Wednesday.
   The expansion calls for the ski area to add 1,400 skiable acres
to its existing 1,600 acres of skiing. The expanded acreage would
be able to accommodate 18,000 skiers per day, compared to the
present 11,000 skiers.
   Vail currently bills itself as North America's largest ski
mountain, with 3,834 acres.
   Besides adding acreage to the resort, the expansion plan calls
for upgrading lifts and adding more lifts, including a funicular -
an elevated rail system.
   The U.S. Forest Service has contracted Winston Associates, a
Boulder-based environmental planning firm, to prepare an
environmental impact statement on the proposed expansion, the first
step toward getting a government special use permit.
   Breckenridge is located in the Colorado Rockies about 80 miles
west of Denver.

<HEAD>Disney Ocean Park Would Generate 36,700 Jobs, $3 Billion a Year</HEAD>

   Walt Disney Co. says its proposed nautical
theme park and resort hotel in Long Beach would create 36,700 jobs
and generate $3 billion in economic activity a year.
   The claims, released Wednesday, were contained in an economic
analysis Disney presented to officials in Long Beach, the big
seaport south of Los Angeles.
   Disney hasn't yet decided whether to build the nautical park as
its ``second gate'' in Southern California. It also is studying the
possibility of opening a different kind of park on property it owns
in Anaheim beside Disneyland, setting up a bidding war of sorts
between the cities.
   The winning city would collect $62 million in taxes and fees.
   Much of the Long Beach park, called Port Disney, would be built
on landfill brought in and dumped in Long Beach Harbor beside the
Queen Mary ocean liner, now operated as a hotel-tourist attraction
by Disney. It would include five hotels with 3,700 rooms and
250,000 square feet of retail space.
   Disney said its owned and operated facilities, plus improvements
to roads, sewers and the rest of the nearby infrastructure, would
cost about $2.8 billion in 1990 dollars by the time the final phase
is complete in 2010.
   How much of that price tag will be picked up by the city will be
a subject of negotiations; Disney expects the rosy economic report
to help wring concessions from the city.
   Still to be completed are studies by Disney and Long Beach on
how smog, traffic and water would be affected by the park. But
Disney officials said the economic study was a milestone.
   ``It's a very important step for us. It will enable us to begin
financial negotiations with the city of Long Beach,'' Alan G.
Epstein, vice president of Disney Development Co., said in a
telephone interview from the company headquarters in Burbank.
   Disney presented its concept for the Long Beach park in July. It
is less far along in its studies for the possible second park in
Anaheim. Epstein said a facility similar to Epcot Center in Florida
is among the proposals for the location beside Disneyland.
   Officials in both cities say they are eager to win the new park.
However, its impact on Long Beach is less clear than for Anaheim.
   Long Beach officials, citing allegations of Disney
high-handedness with Florida cities, have said they will insist the
city as well as Disney must benefit.
   Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said his first reaction was that
Disney's report is ``very impressive.''
   ``But this is just one step in about 100 steps before we are in
a position to say this is going to work,'' Kell said.
   ``Just to bring the landfill over from Catalina (Island) is
going to cost about $300 million,'' Kell said. ``That's just the
starter, and then we have infrastructure to look at - sewer lines,
water, the trucks on the Long Beach Freeway that will have to be
rerouted.''
   The economic study, prepared by the Los Angeles consulting firm
Kotin, Regan &amp; Mouchly Inc. for Disney, said Port Disney would:
   - Create more than 36,700 permanent jobs in Southern California,
including 23,900 in Long Beach, plus many more jobs during
construction. Port Disney itself would employ about 12,400 people,
making it the second largest private employer in Long Beach.
   - Generate about $1.7 billion in new economic activity each year
in Long Beach as part of the $3 billion total for the five-county
greater Los Angeles region.
   - Produce more than $62 million in new taxes and fees to Los
Angeles County and the city of Long Beach.
   ``With this substantial increase in annual revenues, Long Beach
would be able to fund not only the public infrastructure required
to accommodate the project, but solutions to some of its most
pressing problems,'' Epstein said in a statement.
   Kell, who told The Associated Press in an earlier interview that
Disney cheiftain ``Michael Eisner didn't get to be the top-paid
executive in the country by giving cities good deals,'' reserved
judgement.
   ``There's still a lot of hurdles to go,'' he said.
   But he said that as a former real estate developer, he knew Long
Beach has a far stronger hand in dealing with Disney than
landlocked Anaheim because of a big advantage: ``Location,
location, location.''
   ``You have to have pretty great eyesight to see the ocean from
Anaheim,'' Kell said.
